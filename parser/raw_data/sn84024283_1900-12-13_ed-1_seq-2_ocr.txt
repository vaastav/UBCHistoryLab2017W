Hard Pressed on All Sides
by the British.
H!S ATTEMPT OH CAPE COLONY FAILED.
The Chase of the Wily Commander
Has Been One of the Most Kxclt
lns Operations of the War, and Im
Expected to Result, Intimately, In
His Capture.
Aliwal North, Cape Colony, Friday,
D ce.7. Gen. De Wet appears to be in
a most dangerous position, , and to
need all his strategy to extricate his
force. With strong British columns
on three sides and two swollen rivers
barring his front, the British com
manders begin to be lfopeful that the
great chase by four columns, which
has been one of the most exciting op
erations of the war, will result in the
capture of De Wet.
De Wet's Whereabouts.
Definite news of his whereabouts
was first received December 2. The
next morning Gen. Knox started in
hot pursuit, and Pilcher's and Her
bert's columns were detached to make
a turning movement. After three
hours' march Gen. Knox learned that,
during the night De Wet had doubled
back past the British right, necessi
tating a complete, change of plans
During the night of December 3 Gen.
Knox encamped on the Carmel farm.
the site of the Boer laager, which evi
dently has been recently and hurried
ly moved.
Made a Daylight Start.
Gen. Knox started again at day
light, hoping to corner De Wet while
crossing Karrepoort drift, but he ar
rived too late. The British experi
enced very, great difficulty in follow
ing De Wet, owing to the rise in the
river, but they succeeded in crossing
without the loss of a man or a beast.
From that time on the pursuit of the
Boers was taken up witneut baggage,
the troops being supplied by foragers,
enabling them to make more rapid
movements, and keep in touch with
the republicans.

LETTER FROM JUDGE TAFT.

Success Filipino Rebellion
Forcefully Described.
Cincinnati, Dec. 10. Judge W. ' H.
Taft. president of the Philippine com
mission, writing to a friend in this
city, from Manila, under date of Oc
tober 29, speaks of conditions in the
islands as follows:
"You are right in thinking there is
a great deal of work to be done in
these islands. Whether or not we
shall be successful is, of course, a
question that can not be answered
with certainty, but that we are hope
ful of the result I am glad to be able
to assure you. The re-election of
President McKinley will be a long
step toward the complete pacification
of these islands, and will, I hope, end
wha,t remains of the insurrection,
which is now continued only for elec
tion purposes, to influence the result
in America, and which is maintained
almost wholly by terrorism and con
spiracy of murder, threats and assas
sination, by a small number of Fili
pinos in arms against their own peo
ple." LOOKS LIKE A COLLAPSE.

Possessions In the Attempt to
Save Themselves.

of supplies and the occupation of new
points are quite numerous, those in
volving actual lighting are compara
tively few. Apparently the insurgents

selves GOOD FOR CHRISTMAS MONEY.

Negotiations to te Opened Iamedb
ately at PeklnThe Coast Clear
ing A Social Clob.
PeMn, Dec 9. All the foreign en
voys except Sir Edward Mason Satow,
the British minister, have received in
struction from their governments
agreeing to the joint note proposed
at the last meeting. Another meeting
will probably be called for Tuesday
next. Should the British minister
have received instructions to sign the
joint note by that time, communiea
tion will be immediately opened with
Prince Ching and Li Hung Chang, who
are in daily touch with the court by
the Chinese teiegraph.
Prince Ching says Emperor Kwang
Su is ready to return as soon as as
sured that the negotiations will allow
him to come under conditions con
sonant with his dignity and safety.
The removal of Gen. Tung Fu
Hasiang from the command of the
Chinese forces surrounding the court
is considered by the foreign envoys to
be a very important step, as showing
the real desire of the government to
come to terms. His banishment indi
cates 'that the court recognizes the
expediency of obeying the demands of
the powers.
The envoys are considering the
question of legation bundmgs in the
future. At present none of the gov
ernments owns its buildings, all the
houses being rented. The only ones
not damaged considerably are the
American, British and Russian. It is
proposed that all the legation build
ings should be concentrated within a
square mile west of the Tartar City;
that each building should be owned
by the governraent using it, and that
the whole should be surrounded by a
moat and drawbridges having an in
ternational guard sufficient to protect
the legations against any repetition
of the recent attack. The only other
buildings which it is proposed to al
low within the enclosure with the le
gation houses and the necessary of
fices, would be the foreign clubs.
The International club was opened
yesterday, its object being to bring
together in a spirit of social harmony
the officers and diplomats of the vari
ous nations. There was a large com
pany present, and music was dis
coursed by military bands. It is ex-
bpected that the club will continue a
great success. The building was for
merly an imperial temple.

Quite Impossible.

the' fact tnat its existence has been
kept a close secret is sufficient to in
dicate its author's intention - to ab
stain from any active steps friendly

pleads his illness as a sufficient ex
cuse for not interfering.

crowd on his return from the cathe
dral, yesterday, turned and roundly
reDuked those near him for such a
desecration of the Sabbath."
