CARRANZA NOT EXPECTED TO
ANSWER AMERICAN NOTE UNTIL
EXPIRATION OF ANOTHER WEEK
General Impression in Washing
ton Is That Mexican Presi
dent Will Refuse Again to
Release Consular Agent.
Washington. Dec. 2.—President Car
ranza of Mexico ia expected to reply
within a week to the last American
note requesting immediate release of
William O. Jenkins, United States con
sular agent imprisoned at Puebla.
The Mexican answer is not expected
earlier than that and the general im
pression here seems to be that it will
be another refusal. This would moan
tnat negotiations for Jenkins' freedom
would continue. It was stated on high
authority that use of the word "re
quest" in the two notes calling for
Jenkins' release did not close the door
to further correspondence, as would j
l ave been the case had the word ' de
mand" been used.

Government's Stand During
the Peace Conference.
Rome, Dec. 1.—(Delayed)—The Hal
fer press tonight hailed the king's ad
dress to the chamber of deputies at
Its opening session today as complete
vindication of the government's stand
during the peace conference.
In the failure of the Socialist dem
onstration when the king entered the
chamber the press saw a-repudiation
by a majority of the people of ex
t-eme socialism.
SOCIALIST OPPOSITION
Th« great loyaJist demonstration
which resulted from the Socialist depu
ties leaving the chamber when the
king entered, "was not only addressed
toward the crown but was a determln -
•d movement In opposition to social
ism," the Corrlera DTtalla declared.
The king's address showed full har
mony with the Catholics' program, es
:!ally that part of it condemning
treaty of Versailles, the newspaper
whole nation warmly approves

Establishment of National Budget System and Simplification of
Income and Excess Profits Taxes Recommended by the
President—Legislation to Reduce High Cost of Living and
Extension Lever Act Urged.
Washington, Dec. 2.—President Wilson today gent to con
gress a message urging an extensive program of reconstruc
tion legislation. His communication was devoted entirely to
the great problems confronting the nation.
Legislation was recommended to curb Bolshevism in
America, reduce living costs, remove the grievances of labor
which are causing industrial troubles, aid farmers to produce
bigger crops, simplify the system of taxation built up during
the war, control government xpenditures by a budget eye
tern and care for the nation's soldiers and sailors who have
left the service.
REFERS TO PEACE TREATY.
Though the president several times referred to the peace
treaty and the league of nations he did not discuss the treaty
situation. He will do so in a later message according to re
liable information today. He also will deal later with the rail
road question he informed the legislators.
Much of the message was devoted to the discussion of tho
labor problem. To solve it the president said "oongresBntnst
help in the difficult task of finding a method that will
about a genuine democratization of industry based upon
full recognition of the right of those who work, in whatever
rank, to participate in some organic way in every deeiiion
which directly affects their welfare."
OLD STANDARDS OBSOLETE.
No better means of doing this can be found, the president
declared than by applying in legislation the principles set up
in the labor section of the league of nations covenant. To go
back to old standards of labor and wages is impossible, he said.
Age-long antagonisms between capital and labor must be ended,
he declared before real world stability can be accomplished.
In this the United States, he said, is bid by the world unrest to
''put our own house in order" and "be the first to lay tho
foundation stones" of industrial peace. The president warned
against anti-strike legislation.
''The right of individuals to strike is inviolate," he de
clared, ''and ought not to be interfered with by any process of
government."
GOVERNMENT MUST PROTECT.
But he added that the government j
, , . , J
has the p,edominant rlBht to protect
n " thp People against the challenging
aggression of anv single class.
Analysis of labor's complaint, the•
prp * ,dent tolci congress, shows It
based upon Justice. Capital, too, he i
declared has a right to an adequate
return, and the government, he warned
must never ''play" capital and labor
against each other,
UNREST.
' ____
f° r 'he unrest in the countr}
was placed partly upon the senate for
j tt , failure to ratify the peace treaty.
~ of ^ the pre *'
dent asserted, is "the failure on the
part of our government to arrive
speedily at a Just and permanent peace
permitting return to normal condi
tions."
While congress should deal with the
activities of Reds and agitators the
president advised against action eith
er "impatient or drastic." He urged
that the causes of unrest be sought
and removed, and outlined them thus:
CAU8E OF UNREST.
The causes of this unrest, while!
various and complicated, are super
fictal rather than deep-seated. Broad
