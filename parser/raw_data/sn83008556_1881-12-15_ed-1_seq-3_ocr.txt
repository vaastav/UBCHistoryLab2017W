—We are happy to learn from papers
and letters, that our young, old
friend, Mr. Antefc S. Ruhl, of Rock
ford, Illinois, is getting along in the
world swimminoly. He is a leading cit
izen and business man of the thriving
young city, runs the celebrated Nel
bod Knitting Factory, whose hosiery
has a world-wide reputation, is happi
ly married and hasan interesting family
—but his perverted politics—pshaw!
And we can not help thinking of what
was said to a certain other young man
who had asked an important question:
"one thing thon lackest ." Guess we must
go out there some time and set Antes
right.
It seems to lie expected of every pa
per, city or local, largo or small, to
give at least a fair synopsis of the
President's annual message. But to do
so even approximately in the Journal
would crowd out all other reading mat
ter and local news. Knowing that our
readers would much dislike to have our
Stalwart President's message take up
all our available space, we concluded
to givo it in the form of a supplement
and let each ouo have his own conclu
sions about it. We may still have
some comments to make upon it at a
later period, but have not the time,
nor are we in just the exiet humor to
do so now. Suffice it to say that we
take no stock at any price in President
Arthur.
In order to off-set tho dry and prosy
message of the President, we cbncluded
to print our own annual message on
the other side cf oor Supplement. Our
message differs widely from Arthur's,
but we shbinit to the inteligent people
ofthe United States whether ours is not
the plainer, more pointed and practi
cal document of the two. Our sug
gestions and recommendations are not
hid and lost in a multiplicity of words,
but will be readily understood by all.
Neither are we soexculsiveand tipish as
to address ourselves to a select class of
senators and congressmen only: we
speak to all —wether senator, congress
man or plain citizen. In one other
point our message has a most dec id I'd
advantage over President Arthur's—
it is brief. "Brevity is the soul of tcrt."
Arthur's message has neither brevity
nor wit, and least of all—soul—in it.
We know what people like to read, es
pecially at this festive season. Ait bur
don't—and that's the difference be
tween Arthur and tee.

FROM WEALTH TO INSANITY.
Tho Romanoo of a YoungJ Woman
Found Demented at a Depot.
JERSEY CITT, December 7.
An insane woman was arrested at
the Central Railroad depot in this city
night before last, bavin? come in the
cars from Easton, Fa. Last night it
was learned that the woman's name is
Annie Thomnson, formerly a resident
of Monteclair, N. J., where her family
were at one time wealthy people. By
unsuccessful speculations her father
became impoverished, and his reverses
preyed on him so that he died. The
mother and two daughters came to
New York, and one got occupation as a
book-agent. About six months ago
she began to show signs of mental
abenatiou, and about three months
ago mysteriously disappeared. The
next thing heard of her was that she
had attempted suicide by jumping in
the rapids above Niagra Falls. Two
men who saw her preparing for tho fa
tal plunge forcibly restrained her.
She was sent back to New York, and
since then her whereabouts were un
known until her present arrest. She
wa* this morning sent to the county
jail, so that she might be properly ex
amined by the county Physician. All
efforts to lind her friends have been un
availing.

Senator Cameron called his congress

neral Keiter is your candidate." To
which they meekly responded, "Gen
eral Keifer is our candidate," and
prestol the whole situation is chanced.
The republican congressmen from
Pennsylvania have been branded
"Cameron's Cattle." Had they not
qetter be branded "C. C," in order that
very one may know at a glance whoso
propery they are?
