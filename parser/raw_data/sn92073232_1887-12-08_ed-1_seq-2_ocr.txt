tire state. He was known and loved
in almost every village and hamlet
throughout North Carolina and there
are friends from the mountains to the
sea coast who grieve for his loss.
This writer knew him to love him.
We considered him a type of grand,
manly character. He spoke what he
believed the right on all occasions,
without fear and without favor.
His was a character so strong, so
nobly formed.that Duty over rode all
thought of self. With him Right was
above Might, and a clear conscience
above the plaudits of a multitude.
We do not believe we have ever
known a more fearlsss man and at the
same time a warmer heart. That
trite sayirjg "Death loves a shining
mark" was indeed true in his case, or
as .Horace beautifully expresses it,
"The lightning, sparing the humble
shrub creeping on the ground, rives
the majestic oak, towering to the
skies."
Apart from his deep piety and un
doubted religion, he was a man whom
the world could not help but admire,
so strong, so powerful. We believe
the best epitaph and the most express
ive would be: "This was a man," and
yet it scarcely expresses ali of what
Dr. Burkhead was.
He was a true Christian and as such
we believe his is the reward "that
paseth all human understanding.
That thought, relieves the sorrow and
dulls the pang that all hia friend
must feel in thinking of so grand a
life so suddenly ended.
decided on Monday that the restrain
ing order was in conflict with the ele
venth amendment of the constitution
and ordered the release of the State
officers.
This is a slap in the face to Bond,
just what he deserved, and is a vir
tual admi33ion that the States have a
sovereignty that the circuit court
judges can not and hereafter dare not
over-ride, for which let us congratu
late ourselves and our own s!ate.
PCKITT IX POLITICS.
"Now they'vs gone and nominated
that blather skite Jim Sikes and I
don't believe he's worthy of my vote
or anybody else's" is the remark we
very frequently hear good, honest
men make after a convention, and then
they complain and rail at the party
when, if they only knew it, they aidr
el Jim Sikes to his position by stay
ing away from the caucus. Good souls,
they "ain't going to have anything to
do with politics," oh no, they are go

We must recognize the best element in
our conventions and to do this that
best element must attend the primar

are going to have a warm tima of it.
We will need the most perfect "mir

party on the ticket, and the way
to get them is for every good
citizen to take part in the
primaries. Organize, go to work, re

your vote on election day. Go to the

DEATH OF 1R. BURKHEAD
" Jnstfft iksTiiidst of the Methodist

Death called one of its most hojored
and useful members. He was the

the Ceutenary M E. Church, of Win

On Friday he was apparently well,
but in the evening, while taking sup
per at the residence of Mr. J. W.
Welch, he complained of illness, went
to his room, grew worse and expired at
7:lo p. m., surrounded by lov
friends.
lhe Bishop appointed Drs. Robey
and liobbitt, and Rev.. Normau and
Mann and Prof. Carr, a Committee to
take charge of the remains. They
were cart led to Raleigh and interred
Sunday. Short and appropriate ad
dresses were made by Revs. Bobbitt,
INorman, and Maun on his church
work ; Dr. Eugene Grissom, Eugene
Gray, and O. W. Carr on his pastoral
and educational labors, and then the
remains were followed to the cemetery
by his family and a host of friends.
The following gentlemen acted as
pall-bearer: Dr. Eugene Grissom,
Dr. J. W. McGee, W. J: Young, G

THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
We have before us the President's
message, but it is too late to make
copious extracts. He goes to the
point at once and discusses the sur
plus. He handles the subject with a
statesman's grip. He tells Congress
in plain English that it ought to stop
its time-killing, equivocating policy,
and relieve the people. He says :
"We are not dealing with theory,
but with a condition." He favors a
reduction of the tariff on raw material
first. He fully recognizes the crisis
and shows Congress how to meet it.
So wise, so able, so brave a public
document we have never read.
While he believes in point of.' time,
the reduction of the tariff should pre
cede that of the internal revenue,
thereby conflicting with the opihjqns
of North Carolina, Virginia and Ken
tucky, still we honor and admire him
for his outspoken braver'. He has.
proposed a plan to relieve the people
at once and he should be honored for
what he has done, not blamed for "his
method of doing it
Brother Burkhead, of the Durham
Plant remarked after reading it
"Well, he must have been reading the
Plant's editorials he asrees with us
exactly." We believe he also asrees banks exceeding $250,000 capital : al

horses of pure white heads that are
pronounced red without qualifications
or excuses will be assembled in
the House on Monday, and will
light that body on it3 way to
wisdom. There is a superstition which
causes many members to hope great
things from a Congress possessing this
striking feature. Many Congresses
have been noted for their gray and
buld head?, and some, it is said, for
their pig heads, but no Congress be
fore could bosst more than half a
dozen red heads. As there are 47
standing committees there will not be
enough to go around, so there may be
a pretty sharp rivalrv.
One suggestion to avoid complica
tious that now threaten, is that the
committees on ways and means and
appropriations be composed entirely of
red headed men. It is suggested also
that all the mounted messengers be
required to ride white horses So many
red heads assembled together is sup
posed to mean good luck, and this Is
expected to turn out a "Red Letter"

the red headed brigade.
THE NATIONAL, BANKS.
The annual report of the Controller,
of the currency will be presented to
Congress to-day. It shows that the
total number of national banks or
ganized up to October 31, is 3,805, of
which i)lo have gone into liquidation,
119 have failed, leaving in operation
sit that date 3,061. The total number
of new banks established during the
lust year is 225, ' the total number
closed' is 33, of which 25 went into
voluntary liquidation, and 8 failed.
The most impDrtact of the changes in
