, "We own a Thousand Million
hollars to foreign countries for
money borrowed to carry on the war,
to build railroads, aiul for articles
imported for use and consumption |
here," was the statement only three j
or four tears ago. and the actual
amount of idebtedness was even i
greater. At least sixty million dol
lars liad to be sent abroad each year,
topav the interest on this sum.
What more pleasant reading, than
to learn that. while supporting our
selves, ami even reducing the aggre
gate of home indebtedness, individ
ual, municipal, aril national, our
people are rapidly wiping out this
foreign deht by economy in luxu
ries and in the expenses of loving,
and by producing more ai d more to
send to other lands—by increased
effort, bv developing the agricultur
al resources of our great countyrand
by the blessing of Providence in
fiving us magnificent crops
u the American Agriculturist for
September, we showed that doling
the year ending July Ist. our coon
trv exported of its products $261,714-
679 more than we imported : in two
yevh?. an excess of $128.'281,5116 i nnd
in five years. $667,218,495. In our
October number, we presented the
figures showing that from Aug. IS7S
we bad reduced our national inter
cat bearing dela. S *7l, 852. (,j
--from $2.381.530.271, to $1,809,677..
900), and our annual interest pay
ment in the s one time, from $150.-
977,098 to $95,181 .iK<7. an annual
saving of nearly $56 000,000 ; and
our annual taxation from $488,274,-
465, to $£40.753, 805, or uore tlian
half.
The good work still goes on ; onr
former figures were made up t June
80. We now have the official statis
tics to Oct. 1. Exclusive of specie,
the exports during September were
$57,924. 808.and the imports only
$36,399, 541, a Rain during the
month of over Twenty Million Dol
lars ($20.52.5.267). The total ex
ports from January Ist to October
Ist, 1878. were $533 729. ID; the
imports <1 urine the same -time, were
only $324,598 6 1. a grain in 9 months
of S2US-,60n5-7. At the same time,
the large products of our gold ai d
silver mines are being letaine.t in
tle country hv so much iot oulv
increasing our solid wealth, hut ad
ding to tne reserve for resumption
of s;ecie pavments. The yield of
the mines lor our last fiscal v*ir
WHS a Unit $94,000,000 or $40,226 106
of Gold, and $.6 726.2 4, of Silver.
(About $2,500,000 of Gold ands3.-
000,000 of salver are consumed in the
arts and manuNct lies. The total
stock of gold and silver in the comi
trv July 1 was estimated at $332.-
443 948, an increase of about s9h
-000.000 during the >c-r.r, to v.hich
$26,000,000 was added from the
mines from July Ist to October Ist).
The uu-offieial reiiorta show that
the gain is still goi.,g on, though
temporarily lessened a little in Oc
tober by the Scotch 3mk failure
and consequent tt .accial disturlun- i
cea in Great Britain, which, for tlie |
time being, checked orders tor i
breadstuff*. The business is reviv
ing again now. Great. Britain his
still large requiretu ;uts fur urea !-
stuffs, Willi exlraordin irv sintil
supplies to entne from Hungarv,
India, and Australia. From Jan.
1 to sfept. 27. British India export
ed only 1.19 5.706 bushels of wheat
against 10,485, 158 bushels in the
ftatne tiuie last year. F rut ice is also
fe la vet buyer this year, her imports
of wheat during September alone
being 2,386.320 bushels this year,
against bushels last year.—
The cotton crop is the largest ever
produced in this country, and de
spite the retardation by yellow fev
er, which has now happily ri:suje
peared, the exports in ten weeks
from Sept. 1 were this jear 493 887
bales against 341 751 bales during
the same period in 877.
Surely fcnere is a hopeful outlook
for all classes. White very high
prices for corn and wheat can riot
be expected, it is satisfactory o
learn that there wi l boa demand,
at some price, for all the immense
products of the past two harvests,
so that the country will lie cleared
and a demand exi-t for the next
year's harvest. Our agricultural
readers can with hope and confi
dence lay out their plans, during
these leisure winter days, for putt
ing in a good area of spring crops.
Let thern not forget that the best
Wiping crops are those in which the
largest vield is obtained from the
smallest area. We will do our share
in showing how tnis is to be accom
plished.—American Agriculturist- for
December.
The following is the report ot the
November Term Giaml Jury, by

It is now alnmt the season of the
vear when people think of settling
their small accounts, and we take
tl e opportunity to -remind our
friends and patrons that the printer
needs money just as much as any
body, to carry on his business. The
expenses of a printing office are
large and constant. Labor, rents,
fuel paper and other materials are
all cash items whoso payment it
will not do to put off. The only
safe way in the printing business is
to pay as you go. \\Y would there
fore most kin-My ask our friends to
come to our help bv paving the
sin all sums they owe us either on
subscription, advertising or job
work. We dislike to send lulls to
them, but take this mode to ask
our friends to help us along, and
hope our appeal tna\ not lie in vam.
