NEW York, Dec. 12.—(Special.}— Bradstrtft't
Stock summary will say tomorrow Speculation
this week was narrow and tbe professional
course of prices Irregular, tbe decided depres
sion being succeeded by s firmer tone sod an ad
vance of values. It seems tbat the street is gen
orally In a waiting condition. Leading operat
ors, who assisted In reducing tbe recent sd
vancc, have apparently stood aside
for tbe time being, and on tbe oth
er band, the commits}on bouses seemed
unwilling to eneonrsge much buying on margin
account by customers. The cause of both cases
is undoubtedly scarcity of time money and a
natural hesitancy about conducting any exten
sive speculation on the basis ol call loans. I-a«t
Saturday's unfavorable bank statement naturally
created further manifestations of stringency,
and at tbe opening of the week the rates for
money loans were on a higher level,
rising indeed to one-quarter of 1
per cent per diem on last Monday. This, how
ever, was checked by prompt manner In which
tbe treotury's offer to purchase fsttW.ooo of 4 per
cent bonds was accepted, which unlocked a cur
tea ponding amount of money. Kven more in
fluential was the news that some 15,000,000
of gold had been shipped from Europe
and that additional engagements might
be expected, supplemented by the announce
ment that a meeting of Western railroad presi
dents was to be held in this city on Monday
next, and that all interests were favorable to a
radical and permanent adjustment of rates.
Tbe increasing ease of money tended to create
covering of the outstanding "short ' interest and
led to a substantial recovery of values

GALTK*7OJ», Tex., Dee. 12.—Lyall, British eon
ful here, lately undertook to defend a man
named Kelly, an Englishman, convi''tety>f burg
lary in Houston. Hi* effort* in behalf of the
burglar resulted ih correspondence which will
probably rost him hie official bead. On Novem
ber 9 Governor Ko« wrote to Blaine,
Inclosing the in the Kelly cane, together
with Cwaa! Lyall's letter, and clueed with the*e
worda:
"I respectfully suggest that the Inclosed letter
to of snch acharacter as to call for action by the
United State* authorities with a view to with
drawing his exequatur. Entertaining tbe view*
expressed, bis further official relation* witb the
p«»p!c of this state are calculated to disturb the
friendship snd comity existing between this snd
the British government. A number of letters re
ceived from him have been wanting in that tone
of proper respect which *bould obtain from a
foreign consul to the executive of a state, but I
have hitherto passed them over as unworthy of
notice; but the present assault on tbe integrity
of our judiciary, and the threats be makes use
of, render it necessary that some action be taken
lor the preservation of the respect dne this gov
ernment, snd therefore the matter to confiden
tially committed to your hands."
Following is Blaine's reply to Governor Ro»*,
daU-d December 3: " Referring to your letter of
the fttb ultimo concerning the Improper conduct
of Lyall, British consul at Oaiverton. with refer
ence to tbe case of Kelly, I have tbe honor to in
form you that the mntter bus been duly brought
to the attention of tbe British minister at tbe
capital, aith a statement that in the opinion of
tbss department the conduct of Lyall has de
stroyed bis usefulness as a consular representa

A MOUNTAIN ROOFED OVER.
Unique Piece of Engineering to Prevent
Landslides on the Santa Fe.
Los ANGELES, CaL, Dec. 12.—A unique piece of
engineering is just being completed on the
santa Fe line through Cajon pass that will take
rank with the famous Tehachapi loop on
the Southern Paeific. It amounts in
effect to roofing over the mountain. Mu'h
trouble was experienced last winter on account
of land slides in this pass, which kept the line
blocked most of the time, and to obviate this
difficulty this remarkable piece of work was de
signed.
Broadly described the work consists of a series
of braces, four in number, rising up from tbe
track where the cut is deepest excavated so as to
break the force of water comin?
down the slope and carrying it off by a series of
wooden conduits snd surface drains. These ter
races range from '>oo to .300 feet in length, meas
uring in the aggregate 1.-* jo feet, and are all
roofed over.
An army of men and teams was at work for
some months. The work has been done by Fred
Perns, chief engineer of the Sunta Fes lines,
under the direction of General Manager K. 11.
Wade. This is the first time such work has ever
been d<ne and the result this wii;ter will be
watched with interest, as it is confidently be
lieved the desired effeet will be obtained.
Mr. Wade and a |> irtT of invited (psests, among
them General McCmk, eommanrlinz the de
partment of the Arizona, and a number ol hi#
staff, inspected the work today.

our thoughts and work out the lessons
of our own observations; it is so much
more pleasant to butterfly from theory to
theorv than to seek truth with patient
tenacity; why trouble ourselves to itffcrn
self-reliance when natural indolence pro
tests against the eacru.ce? It is easier to
imitate than to originate; plagiarism and
mimicry are such prominent features in
our lives that their presence might almost
be quoted as an argument in favor of our
evolution in past ages from simian an

make for our want of this individualism!
We are so dreadfully afraid of being

Washington, the proceeds of such sales, after de
ducting the cost of making survey, appraise
ment and sales, be given and paid over to said
county of Clallam JOT the purpose of erecting
and maintaining suitable public buildings for
the use of said county; and that such net pro
ceeds of sale be paid over to the proper authori
ties of said county, under regulation* to be pre
scribed by the secretary of the interior.
Mr. Allen—for the information of the senator
from Missouri, and of other senators. I will say
this bidy of 'and is the remnant oi a reservation
made in Clallam county, in the state of Wash
ington. in the year l&Ci The reservation orig
inally was made for ''public purposes" at a time
before the land* had been surveyed. The orig
inal reservation was by an executive ordeT of
the president of the United States in the year
1X62. subsequently, in the year WC, a certain
small portion of it was reserved for lighthouse
purpose*, after which the original order was va
cated, and under an executive order this body
of land was reserved for townsite un
der the statute of 1883 (being sections -2.3W-2.3H1,
Revised Statutes; authorizing the president of
the United States to reserve from either the sur
veyed or uns irveyed public domain such bodies
of land as he might deem to be advantageous
for pr.»spective towns or centers of population.
An appropriation of f-i/CO was made for the sur
vey of these lands. The appropriation was ex
hausted by the survey of SJUO or IXOO acres,which
were sold pursuant to the act of i.163. The sena
tor w ill remember that that act provided for the
survey of such land into nrban and suburban
lots aad an appraisement of their vaiue and the
offering of the lots at public sale, none of which
eh'juld be sold at a lower price than the ap
praisement. This w«s the condition of this
property from WA The remainder of this land
has been ordered surveyed through an appro
priation made for thst purpose at the iast ses
sion of congress; and now the question is. after
the i»nds are surveyed, whether the proceeds of
the remainder of these sales shall zo into the
treasury of the United states or be given to this
county of Dallam.
I think there is a strong equity for giving the
proceeds of these sales to the county of Clallam,
lor this reason: This strip of In ad was in one of
the most eligible portions of this county* It was
withheld from settle-men?. This withdrawal ob
structed the settlement of that conctv in a most
serious manner. The county of Clallam has an
a of square miles. Ita present pcpnla
ti n is but 2,The county is hugely mount
ainous, very heavily grown with timber and un
dergrowth, difficult of improvement in its pub
lic r>-«ds and bridges and other improvements
of that character.
Then this land has been reserved for a great
man; years. At the time of reservation it was
of no more value than the body of the public do
main <>f which it formed a part. It nas a K renter
vaiue than that at this time, just bow much 1
do not i:now. but senators can very readily form
some idea when I say that it is part of a county
of 2,000 square miles, the entire population of
which is 2.757.
This bill provides that all of the expenses to
the government in the tuner, appraisement
sale and disposal of these lands shall be made
out of the sale, and then only the net balance
sb*ll go to this county for the purpose of public
buildings.
1 do not think «ucb net balance can be very
large-eert*;:;l} not excessive for the purposes
to which it is to be dedicated.
The United States, no far as I know, has rarely
gone into the business of engaging in the spec
ulation of selling town lota, ftut b practice is
entirely exceptional in the state of Washington.
Every town site of our State has grown up an
lands that the government has parted with at
the price it dispose* of the public iands to
settlers who may seek to obtain them. If this
U.nd has any additional value above the lands
that have thus been disposed of, constituting
the sites and vicinities of other towns, it has
been giveu by the settles who have gone there
in advance of development, and by their enter
prise Imparted such value. For this reason it
Is, and on the urgent petition of the people of
that community, that this bill has been Intro
duced end favorably reported from the commit
tc< on public lands.
This bill is quite analogous to the old pre.
emption act that granted lands to counties and
parishes by wcy of pre-emption for the purpose
of constructing publie buildings. There have
b<*en many grants to counties of lands in trust
to be sold and disposed of and the proceeds used
in the construction of public buildings. la-
Mead of doing that in this case, as this land bad
been reserved under the townsite act to which 1
have called attention, it was thought more just
to those who have gone on these lands with a
view of taking them under the act of lthat
they should be sold, and that there should be no
interruption in the method of acquiring title- to
the land under that act, and that the proceeds
should go to the county rather than that the grant
of the land should be made to the couutv in
trust.
The bill wftt passed.
Congressman .Jerry Simpson's Socks,
St. Louis Republic.
Jerry Simpson, who has been elected to
Congress from the Sixth Kansas district
on the Alliance ticket, made a remarkable
canvass. In every speech that he made he
took off his shoes and exhibited his bare
feet in order to demonstrate to his audi
ence that he was too poor to wear sock*.
Today he received from the Fort Scott
woolen mills a handsome pair of socks, ac
companied by the following letter:
'•Now the "election is over, cold winter
is coming on, and it is not meet that
one of the trinunes should appear on
the steps of the capitol without
socks, therefore, Jer t, I herewith en
close you a pair of socks, not the patri
cian stocking of costly siik. but socks
made from good, honest* wool, wool grown
by Kansas farmers on the backs of Kan
sas sheep and manufactured at the only
successful woolen mill in the state. Take
them, Jerry, and wear them. They are
good. hon»-'«t socks, and will do vou good
service. They are not so tine as* some of
vour compeers will wear in Washington,
nut they are well bei.tting a good, straight,
honest Kansas American as I know you to
be. And when any one undertakes to
claim that Americans cannot compete
with the vile st iff made by pauper labor of
Europe from old hnrse blankets. cast-off
undershirt?, and refuse of smallpox hos
pitals. which the very disinterested im
porters enll foreign goods, show them your
socks, and tell them how they were made
from honest Kansas wool."

OPINION OF EX-CHAIRMAN JONES
Tke Idaho Legislature Will Elect Sen
ators scxt Week—Convent!©* of
Tana White Republicans.
Nrw Yok, Dee. 12-—[Special.]—B. F. Jones,
ei-chairman of the Republican national com
mittee, came from Pittsbury on Thursday to
look after some of his business interests here.
He was talking with A. R. Whitney, a well
known iron merchant, and others in Mr. Whit
ney's office, when the conversation drifted to
politics, and almost before be was aware of it,
Mr. Jones was discussing the situation in this
way:
"There is only one course for the Republican
party to pursue. It is that indicated by Presi
dent Harrison. We must stand by our princi
ples. Without the policy of protection out
party is nothing. We could not even carry the
state of Pennsylvania if it were known that we
bad lowered our standards because we happened
to meet with defeat in s single campaign.'
"What do you think of the result of the elec
tion?" was asked.
"Think of it? Why, simply this, that the peo
ple were deceived again by Democratic trickery
and falsehood. Our opponents harped on the
danger of high prices and the increased cost of
living in consequence of the Mc-
Kinley bill. Their papers were filled
with such stuff until the people really
began to think there was something in it. The
president's message was one of the best state
papers ever issued from the White House. It
was manly, wise and eminently statesmanlike.
In my judgment, it has demonstrated the fact
that as things stand now Benjamin Harrison is
the strongest and most available for the party to
nominate In 1MB."
"I think that James G. Blaine is the man
whom we must nominate if we expect to win,"
was the prompt reply of Whitney.
"Oh. Blaine wouldn't take it," said Mr. Jones.
"He doesn't want the worry and vexation that s
presidential canvass involves. I am sure be
would not accept the place if it were offered
him."
"What about Alger?" was asked.
"I don't think he would touch the bottom, so
to speak,"' replied Mr. Jones. "So, he would
not do. I'm speaking now from a purely politi
cal point of view."
STO IDAHO ELECTION YET.
Republican Caactn Agrre Upon Doboli,
Ciagett and Shoap.
BOISE Crnr, Dee. 12.—{Special. J--Thonirh no
ballot for senator was tat en today. nor is it
probable that one will be taken before Tuesday,
the senatorial question is practically settled.
A caucus of twenty-nine Republicans saj
held ton;ght, at which the proposition of
three senator*. one from North Idaho, was fully
discussed. 1 here wss practically no difference
of opinion on the subject It was conceded that
Duboi!' should have the long terra. Nearly all
the members of the caucus agreed to elect him
for that term. It was agreed also that North
Idaho should hove a senator, and Jud?e Cla-
C-tt was the choice of the caucus from that sec
tion. eboup is to be elected ab>o. This com
pletes the number.
Judge Clas?c-tt is still undecided whether or
not to *ccept this proposition, but it i thought
lie will accept. The caucus will insist on his
acceptance, and, should he possibly refuse,
they will elect some other representative
Republican from North Idaho. McConnell is
out of the fight. Governor Shoup is favorable
to the plan suggested by the caucus.
The members of the different senatorial fac
tions are rejoicing tonijrht, shaking hands and
havinz a good time. It is possible that some
thing may occur between now and Tuesday to
break this state, but it is hardly probable. The
number and influence of the caucus members
will carry the matter to a termination. The
friends of the successful candidate* are Jabil
ant.

Colonel Ochiltree'* »w Shirt Front.
Sew York World.
The rumor of the marriage of Colonel
Thomas Pickney Ochiltree was due as
much to a remarkable shirt front which
the colonel brought back from Paris as to
his recent brilliant air of geniality and in
nate blithesomeness. The shirt and the
colonel appeared conjointly one night
along with Buck Taylor and Buck Tay
lor's hat, in Delmonico's, with sacb pro
nounced effect that three waiters dropped
soup plates at a glance. Buck Taylor's hat
is about four feet in circumference and
made of white felt, with a number of shiny
things weaved upon the rim. Buck also
wore a huge fur coat, a yellow silk hand
kerchief around his neck, a vast wad of
long and curly hair and a pair of
neat but not" gaudy overshoes. He
was a startling objeift, but he paled into
insignia cance when contrasted with the
colonel's Parisian shirt. The shirt has
ruffles, billows, tucks and plaits on it,
arranged with such consummate art that
they all threw into sharp relief a large
emerald stud which was nestled into the
folds of the bosom. There was a fascina
tion about the shirt front which caught the
eye of the observer and forced him to fol
low the curves, interstices and convolu
tions with an inexorable fascination. The
shirt was the observed of all eyes while the
colonel remained in the cafe. It started
the rumor of the Texan's marriage because
nobody but a bridegroom wears such a
garment in public in Paris. When the
colonel appeared in an ordinary shirt the
second night he passed unnouced in the
throng.
Cigarettes Killed Him.
New York World.
He would smoke, and so he died, sums
np the case of IS-year-old Frank Ahlers,
who was yesterday morning found dead on
the door of his boarding house at No. 434
West Twenty-third street. He was a bright
yonng lad, who was employed as a clerk in
Mitchell, Vance <t Co.'s factory, at Tenth
avenue and Twenty-third street. His
father and mother are dead, but his sisters
live in Brooklyn. Ever, since he had left
school, three years ago, he had been an
inveterate cigarette smoker. An attack
of scarlet fever, which be had a
vear ago, left him with epi
leptic bts, and Dr. Hammond, his
physician, promised to cure him pro
vided he would follow a course of treat
ment which entailed giving up tobacco.
Up to within two weefcs ago he complied
with the doctor's directions. Then he be
can smoking, and since has not been sc en
without a cigarette in his mouth. He
came in late Sunday night and went to
bed. When Mr. Montrose, the proprietor
of the boarding house, went to call him
yesterday he was found lying undressed
on the aoor of his room dead. A physi
cian who was called in said that deata was
due to an epileptic i.t superinduced by the
smoking. His sisters were noticed and
took charge of the funeral arrangements.
The J«wi and the Stage. I
New York Sun.
The Jew of the stage today occupies 3
different position from the one which
Shakespeare painted: he is recognized as
a power in the land, intellectually and
materially. In this country he hus not
Veen accorded the position given him
either in France or England, though in
Baltimore, Richmond and Charleston
f<tme of the oldest and most aristocratic
families are Jews, who live up to thir
faith, and are of all men. The
type of Jews shown in Isreal Cohen, in
• Men and Women," is by no means un
common, and aren't there a great many of
us Christians who can think of Jews who
have done great kindnesses irrespective of
creed? There is no narrower type in this
world than the man or woman who be
lieves that nothing good can come out of
Judea, and it is quite time that, as
in the more civilized countries of
the world, the intelligent, intellectual Jew.
the one who is a gentleman by birth and
education, should hare that honor given
him which is his due. When a Jewess is
married to one of the reigning princes of
Europe, when a Jew aspires to the hand of
the danghter of the Prince of Wales, when
in literature and art the name of a Jew
stands foremost, don't you think its time
that the narrow cant of th® ignorant man
or woman is scoffed at. rather than agreed
with? Look at thestage: Rachel, Madam
Bernhardt. Adelina Patti. Mrs. Kendall,
and how many others, all hare Jewish
blood in them. Take up the book of the
French salon and look at the list of paint
ers. Take up a list of French writers and
see where the Jews stand amone them, and
do not. because you are supposed to be an
intelligent man,"make a foot of yourself by
attempting to hit the one people of the
world who have, through everything, clung
together and preserved their religion.
Ex-Major Hewitt's Daaghtera.
Chicago News New York Letter.
Two young ladies, guiltless of bangs, but
toned into tweed suits, with stiff Piccadilly
collars daring below their round white
chins, stood up, gloves in hand, in ibe
front of their box, giving their severe and
solemn attention to horses alone, while
several young men below them made pa
thetic efforts to attract their notice.
"Those are ex-Mayor Hewitt's daughters,"
commented my guardian angel of a friend,
who has a gift for slipping through
crowds and knows a storv about every man
and woman in town. " They go in exclu
sively for athletics, drive four-in-hand and
run risks in a catboat in a gale of wind
that make strong men jump. They are
young, not particularly handsome, but rich
and charmingly* mannered. But, dear
me, a man stands no chance in their pres
ence. In their eye* a man is a weak and
effeminate thing if he doesn't take fcve
barred gate? on cross-country runs, and
practicaJly demonstrate his ability to pull
a runawny down into shape after a half
mile dash."
