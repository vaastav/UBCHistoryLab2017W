The Appointing Power.
There is some hope from present indications
tbat Congress will, by some legislation, limit
the power of the President ia the removals
from office of persons appointed by and with
tbe advice and consent of the Senate. As the
law and practice now are, the provisions that ap
pointments shall ba sent to the Senate might
as well be stricken oat of the Constitution
The President, without coneahirg the Senate,
removes any official, and having thus created a
vacancy, commissions one of his followers " un
til the close of the next session of Corgrest,
Sometime during the next session, as may suit
his convenience, he goes through the form of
ending the name of the new appointee to the
Senate. If the Senate refuse to approve the
nomination, the appointee still has a commis
sion until the end of the session, and when the
commission expire the President gives him
another" until the end of the next session of
Congress " In this way the President can
keep in office, during his entire term, officials
whom the Senate have over and over rejected
If Congress doesn't reform this uncsnstitutional
prac'ice, and thoroughly reform it too, they
will deserve to be written down as unfaithful
to their trust. . They should either brin tbe
appointing power back to the plain meaning of
the Constitution, or they should propose to
amend the Constitution to conform to the pres
ent unconstitutional exercise cf tha power.
There is to more Arrant perversion cf a pow
er given by the Constitution, than tbe abuse of
the t ppointing power has now becose.
The fallowing is a summary of the bill which
passed the House last session, and is now be
fore tbe Senate :
The first stction provides that ro officer of
the United S'stea appointed on the nomination
of tbe President by and with the advice and
consent of the derate ha!I be removable, ex
cept ly tt e same tgeneies which concurred in
fcis appointment ; provided, however, that in
case cf disability ir in it conduct in office, cccur
rin during tbe recets cf tbe Serste, where the
interests of the public mr-y make it reces&ry
to displace the incumbent, until the advice and
consent f that Ixcy csn be duly bad snd ob
tained thereon, it fh?.il be lawful fr tbe Presi
dent, on the rt commer.dstion of the Attotrey
Gneral. to eusj-er.d the disabled or defaultirg
efficer, and to commission arother person to
perform the duties of tbe place until the Sen
ate shall have an opportunity of acting tbere
upen ; and it shall be tbe dutv of the Presi
dent, within two days after the next assemblage
cf that body, to report to it the fact of such
suspension, along with the reason therefor, and
tbe name of he person so temporarily commis
sioned by him, or of such person as he may
think proper to nominate for the pi ice. And
in case cf the refu.-al of the Senate to concur
in the removal, either by a direct vote thereon,
or by advising and consenting to the person ro
nominated, the efficer who has been thus sus
pended shall thereupon resume the exercise of
official functions as though the rame had not
been interrupted. But in ro cafe shall tbe
person so restored be entitled to any salary or
compen-ation for the interval of time during
which his functions may have been suspended
as aforesaid.
The second a?ctirm provides that in case cf
refusai of tbe Senate to advise end consent to
tbe r-nomtnation of any officer whose term
of service may hie expired by its own limita
tion, the place filled by the person so renomin
ated siaii be regirded, and is hereby dtcUred
to be vtciot from tbe time cf such refu.-al.
But 6hou!d the Senate adjourn without action
on such renomination, either in the way of con
sent or disapproval, the same shall be held to
ba vacant immediately after euch adjournment.
And in no ca.e shall any person who has been
nominated by tbe President for any tffice acd
rejected by me Senate, or on whose nomination
that body has failed or declined to act in tae
way of onsnt or disapproval, be appointed
or commiioo?d by him after the adjourn
ment, and durirrfj the recess of that b-idy to
hold the same office for which he had been
previously nominated.
A ptoposttion his been made in the Senate
to strike out the third section of the House
bill, and insert, substantially as follows :
When a vacancy happening during the re
cess may have been hi ed by the President,
it shall be his duty to make a nomination be
fore the end of the next session. And in case
of the nomination of any other person than
the one commissioned, and the refusal of the
Senate to adv.se and consent thereto, the of
fice shall not be considered as vac ml i-d its ad
journment ; but the person so commissioned
shall continue to bold and erpy the same dur
ing the recess, and until be shall be either
nominated r rrj-cied, or duly superseded by a
new appointee.
That tbe heads of departments bhall bold
their office for the term of four j ears, unless
removed with tbe concurrence of the Senate,
and shall nominate, and bv and with tbe ad
vice and consent of the Senate, appoint all
their assistant and subordinates to hold for
the like period, unless removed in the like
manner.
Seward and Johnson's Policy ns
Heard Mexico.
The official correspondence between Secre
tary Seward and Minister Bigelow, respecting
tbe French occupation of Mexico, has j-irt
been published.
Mr. Bigelow'a despttch giving an account
of his interview with Napoleon in which the
Emperor told Kim of his purpose not to recall
any portion of tbe French troops until spring,
is, in its more important part, as follows :
4 I concluded that it would be more satis
factory to tbe President that I tbould see the
Emperor himseif upon tbesutject. I accord
ing'y waited upon his Maj-iy yesterday, at
at. Cloud, repeated to him wbat tne Alarquis
de Mou&lier bd told me, ai d desired to know
what, it so) thing could be door by me to an
ticipate and prevent the discontent which I
fell persuedeJ would be experienced by my
country people, if tbey receive this intelligence
wuhcu. any explanation. I referred to the
early meeting of Cor gres, when any charge
in our relations either with France or Mexico
would be likely tc come under discussior, and
my fear that his M-jsstj's reasons for post
poning the repatriation of the first detach
ment of bis troops might be attributed to
motives which our people would be disposed
to resent.
Tbe Emperor said that it was true that he
bad concluded to pes'prna the recall of any
of his tioops until sprirg ; but that in doing so
he had been UitluecceU by entirely military
considerations. Al the time be give the or
der, the successors of the dissidents, support
ed as tbey were by large re-enforcements from
the Uui'.ed State, teemed to render any re
duction of bis force there perilous to thotte rev
maining behind.
lie accordingly sent a telegraph to Marshal
Baziine, who bad already tmbsrked a regi
ment (eighty-first, I think be sain), bat which
had fortunately been prevented rrrm sailing
by unfavorable winds, directing bim to embark
no troops until all were ready to come. This
dispaicb, bis Mejesty said was not sent in cy
pher, that no secret might be made of its
tenor in tbe Uoited States. Tbe troops were
then disembarked anrl returned to Oriiib.
llis Majesty went on to say that he sent Gen.
Castelnau to Mexico about tf e tame time,
ch-rged to inloim Maximilian that France
could not give him another cent of money
tor another man : if be thought he could sus
tain himself there aktno. Fiance would not
withdraw her troop faster than bad been
stipulated for bv M. Druyn deL'Hoys, should
such be his desue; bat if, on the oiner band,
he was exposed to abdicate, wbich was tbe
course bis Mtjesty counseled him to . take,
Uen. Castelnau was charged to find some gov-
. eminent with which to treat for the protec
tion, of Fresch interest, sod to bring all tbe
army home in the spring.
I naked his Majesty if the President of the
United States had been notified of this, or
i.v tbinr bad been a one to prepare his
mstd for tie change in bis Majesty's policy
He sa d that he did not know i that M. de
Moustier ought to bave drne so ; that, as these
events occurred daring tbe interim of a
change in tbe ministry of foreign affairs, it was
possible that it had been neglected, though
his telegram to Marshal Bazaina was purpose
ly sent in a way to show that there was noth
ing in bis plans to disguise."
Mr. Seward writes to Mr. Bigelow, say
ing :
We cannot acquiesce :
First. Because tbe term ' next spring,' as
appointed for the entire evacuation, ia indefi
nite and vague.
Second. Becime we have no authority for
stating to Congress and to tbe American peo
pie, that we have now a better guaranty for
tbe withdrawal of the whole expeditionary
force in the epring than we hate heretofore
bad for the withdrawal of a part in Novem
ber. Third. In full reliance upon al least a lite
ral performance of the Emperor's existing
agreement, we have taken measures, while fa
cilitating the anticipated French evacuation, to
co-operate with tho Republican government of
Mexico for promoting the pacification of that
country, acd for tbe early and complete resto
ration of the proper constitutional authority of

This is too thin a difguiee to cheat anybody,
Tbe truth is, Johnson and Seward have e-
ruv,d Juarez's cause, oromised him help, and
r
have already so far fulfilled their pledge as
btation an " army of observation " near Mex
ico ; and tbey bave substantially ordered Gen.
Sherman t-J report to Juarez, Johnson, Seward
and company, ff-r orders in this Mexican
business. We tiust Congress and tbe peo
ple will make co delay in advising Mr. Jobnson
and Mr. Seward, that, until we hate pacified
our own country and given protection to loyal
men at home agaicst the assaults and brutali
ties of pardoned and unpardoned rebels, we
are in no condition to take upon ourselves the
regulation of the domestic concerns of any
other state. A government that cannot, as
Johnson says it can't constitutionally inter
fere to say who shall govern South Carolina,
had better not trouble itself just at present
about who governs Mexiso.
The Complication on the Rio Gbanob.
A dispatch from General Sheridan to General
Grant, dated New Orleans, Nov. 27, 1866, baa
been received, in which Gen. Sheridan sends a
copy of a communication from Gen. Sedgwick,
commanding the sub-district ot the Rio
Grande. Gen. Sheridan says :
' Although the contemplated action of Gen.
Sedgwick will not make any complications,
still it is disapproved by me as against my or
ders, and so far as 1 know, unjustifiable. In
structor are ia possession of Gen. Sedgwick
that if American citizens, if any are in Mata
moras deserviog to be called such, think their
grievances could not ba settled by tbe military
authorities tbey must seek the proper avenue,
the S ate Dcoartiuent, for redress. I very
much fear Geu. Sedgwick has allowed himseif
to be influenced oy Matamoras shrewdness.
Those who bave furnished supplies to Canales
to sustain bim in bis acts, since they cannot
bave tbe debts aeknowledged by Gen. Ecobe
do, nor personal security given by Canales,
now find some means t influence this bad
' iuJgment on the part of Gen Sedgwick. Tbe
act contemplated by Gen. Sedgwick may not
take place, but u u does 1 will regret it.
Tha following is (sen. Sedgwick's communi
cation abort referred to. It is dated at Browns
ville, Texas, Not. 22, and addressed to Gen.
heridaa :
" The condition of affairs along this border'
and especially the state of affairs now existing
ia Matamoras, renders it necessary for the
United States to interefere, in order that the
lives and property of the American citizens,
may be protected. Camles has just declared
to his men that they most help themselves.'
This means indiscriminate pillage, robbery,
breaking open of stores, etc. Canales has of
late frequently violated the neutrality laws
now existing between the United States and
Mexico ; and in view of all these facts, I deem
it my bounden duty to interfere, and shall this
day demand of Canales the surrender of tha
city of Matamoras, which I shall bold until I
receive instructions from ycu."
It is said that Gen. Sheridan has removed
Gen. Sedgwick. It is certain that the latter
officer transcended his duty when he invaded
Mexican territory. That he and the troops
under him were glad of an excuse for taking a
hand in the Mexican business, there ia not
much doubt; and it is not impossible that
Gen. Sheridan himself would have been glad
to have received orders from Washington to
drive Maximilian out of Mexico. Intervention
in Mexico has cost tbe French Government a
j good many millions, and if the United States

gress and from voting upon the Constitutional
amendments.

in violation of law.
7tb. A special commit'ee to investigate the

There was a decided feeling manifested in
the caucus to assert all the prerogatives of
Congress, and to provide against the evident
purpose ot Mr. Jobnson to use all tbe means
at bis command to aid tbe Southern disloyal
communities in their resistance to the just
demands of tbe loyal people .of the country,
Sexpreeiad in the recent elections.
TiKRiTORiAL Governments for thk Rebel
States. Last Wednesday the House of Rep
resentatives passed the following resolution ;
Resolved. That tbe Committee on Territories
be inatructed to inquire into the expediency of
reporting a bill providing territorial govern
ments lor tne several aisiricuj or country wnu
in the jurisdiction of tho Unted States, for
merly occupied by tbe ooco existing states of
Virginia, ortn uaronna, douiu eaiunua,
Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Lou
isiana, Arkansas and Texas, and giving to all
adult male inhabitants born within tbe limits
of the United States, or duly naturalized and
not participants in the late rebellion, full equal
political right in such territorial governments.
Tbe vote upon tbe resolution was 107 to 37,
the Jobnsooiied Republicans, like Raymond
Hale and others, voting against it. It docs
not pledge tbe House to pass a bill to re-organ-
lxe tbe southern states, yet it is a tolerably
clear indication of. tbe conviction of tbe Re
publicans in Congress tbat each a bill is the
onlv true method of reconetr action. Ae to
what action Congress will probably take on
ibis subject, a Washington dispatch has the
following :
It is the opinion of a prominent Senator
who faai bad unusual opportunities of otser
ration, tbat at the present session of CoDgrees
an enabling act will be passed, rejecting tbe
present governments of the rebellious states
aa nullities, and that the loyal people of those
states, without respeot to color, will be au
thorized to choose delegates to constitutional
conventions, and that the conventions will be
required to submit tha constitutions thus form
ed to a rote of the people for approval or re
jection. The Senator makes these statements
with so much earnestness, that little doubt
can be entertained of his source of informa
tion. He predicts that the bill will very
ehortly be presented for action."
Constitutional Akindmxnt. Mr. Went
worth of Illinois offered the following resolu
tion in the House of Representatives last
Tuesday :

stitutional Amendment, before it will coneider
tbe propriety of giving them congressional
representation.
This resolution passed by a vote oi 1U to
32. It indicates that Congress is as firm in
its position as the President in his; and it
leaves the persons claiming seats from the
Southern communities which reject tbe con
stitutional amendment, to contemplate a con-1
tioued absence from Congressional Halls a3
the reward of their contumacy.
Will not Liav. Mr. Raymond, of New
York, is disinclined to leave the Republican
party. At the caucus at Washington he ap
peared, and when interrogated, declared tbat
be was still a member of the party, und not
a Johnson man or a Democrat. Lie, howev
er, said be etill adhered to the platform and
address of the Philadelphia bread-and-butter
convention as be understood it. The caucus
voted not to expel him from tbe meeting. He
votes, however, very much as he did last ses
sion, and that is, generally, with the Demo
crats. Mr. Ingersoll of Illinois, offerer! tbe follow
ing resolution last week in tbe lloute ;
Resolved, Tbat tbe President of tbe UnitcP
States is hereby respectfully requested to in
form tbe House, if not incompatible with the
public interest, bow near tho verge of the

centre than be formerly supposed.
After tbe resolution had answered its pur
pose, creating considerable merriment, it was
rejected .

The Test Oath. It was announced last
week tbat tbe United States Supreme Court
had decided the test oath unconstitutional.
The report has, however, since been contra
dicted. No such decision has been made.
The only question before the Court was as to
the application of the law requiring the oath to
he taken to the attorneys of that Court ; but
even tbat question has cot yet been decided.
Omb Tibm. Senator Wade, of Ohio, intro
duced last tecsion a resolution proposing such
an amendment to tbe Constitution aa will
make a President ineligible for re-eleoiion, Lut
no final aotion was taken upon it. lie, bow-
ever, brought the subject to the notice of the
Senate Wednesday, and said that be should
press it to ao early vote.
PosTafASTiKa Changed. Tbe following
changes have been made in postoffices in this
State :
Sirafford, Henry C. Hatch, vice D. C Hayes,
removed ; West Derby, Cyrus Lias, vice
M. Sprague, resigned ; West Randolph, Ho
mer K- Stougbton, vice C. C. Stearns, re
signed.
We are not informed of the political char
acter of the new appointees, but we presume
they are Johnson Democrats now, whether
they were formerly Republicans or not. Thd
Stevens says there is no snob thing aa Jobn

Tbey are as scarce aa white blackbirds.

Congress.
We give in our Washington Correspond
ence, snd in various editoral paragraphs,
nearly all the important proceedings of Con
gress last week. In addition to what we
have given elsewhere, wa find the following
in relating to the Vermont Senators :
Senator Edmunds introduced an important
bill in the Senate Thursday, directing the
Commissioners appointed under an act of 1864
to report the names of persons in the loyal
slave States whose slaves were enlisted, and
to fix tbe amount oi compensation due to
them, to report to Congress instead of to tha
President or Secretary of War. Tbe bill also
prevents tbe payment of money out of the
Treasury for this purpose, until Congress
shall order it. It is a measure which affects
the late slaveholders of Kentucky and Mary
land to the amount of several million dollars.
Mr. EJmundsalso presented the resolutions

Washington, D. C. Deo. 7. 1866.
Mb. Editor : Congress baa again met and
in very different circumstances from those in
wbich it adjourned. Then , they had just
sent forth their plan for tbe reconstruction of
tbe Union, to a people eomewhat alienated by
tbe long delay necessary to mature that plan,
for approval or condemnation many feared
the latter. They perceived the Democrats .un
der the lead of the President, struggling des
perately to obtain the power, and to that end
prostituting all the patronage of the Execu
tive and vilifying every motive and action of
Congress ; and tbey fcund many of their own
numbers led away by vain promises, and if
not openly yet secretly opposing theni. It is
safe to eay tbat many trembled for tbe result
in their own districts. In view of all these
far. they deemed it t:ecefy to to borne pni
ed with a ple-i for the Constitutional Amend
ment ; then Pennsylvania and fair sister etates
gave their voice for Congress ; and finally Wew
York and tbe whole long train of states declar
ed against the President and his policy. Poor

of removing ail political matters from that
important department..
On Tuesday, Mr. Liwrence of Ohio intro
duced a bill to repeal the ac; raising tbc
salaries of Congressmen to $5000 per year,
which will probably give satisfaction t the
great majority, althougU a few will recognize
the propriety of paying our public Ecrvants
in a manner to compensate iu soma degree
for their labor and responsibility.
AMNESTY IMPACUXKNT.
Greeley's doctrine of Universal Amnesty
makes no converts to itself, and baa only bad
tbe effect to assure his absence from the Sen
ate daring the next term. Butler is here and
urging impeaohment. lie says he considered
tbat every Republican voted for impeach
ment at the last election, and any thing less
than tbat will be unsatisfactory and a neglect
of duty. If a bill of impeachment can prop
erly be made at tbis Session, wa may rest as
sured that it will b-s done and Johnson de
prived of the power to do any more harm.
DAT OF MEETING OF NEXT CONGRESS.
There is a proposition now before tbe House
to change the day of meeting to the 4ch of
March, ia order that a new Congress may be
organized immediately on the dissolution of the
preceding one, and the long interval now exist
ing between the two Congresses may be done
away with. In connection therewith is a
proposition to fix the time of election of Rep
resentatives in the different states on the first
Tuesday in November.
VERMONT SENATORS.
Mr. Poland and Mr. Edmunds are both at
their posta in the Sanate. Yesterday Mr.
Poland offered a resolution for more tffioient

reference to the wool-growing interests. He
also gave notice that be should, on Monday,
call up the bankrupt bill wbich passed the
House last session, and was given bim to ex

wanting in amusements. Very few people,
comparatively, are spending tne wmier uerc,
and there is a prospect that fashionable circles
will be rather dull. On all sides, in fact,
are evidences that the city is settling back
into its old, dull state, and losing tha little
Yankee energy it acquired during the war.
Happily, however, that has obtained too gooi
a footing to be easily displaced, and there is
some hope tbat before it ia gone the regenera
