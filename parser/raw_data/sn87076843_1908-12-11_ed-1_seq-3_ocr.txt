Vital to the Well-Belng of Country.
Washington. Tho message of Presi
dent Roosovelt was rend In both
bouses of congress Tuesday. In sub
stanco tho document was as follows:
To the Sonato and Houso of Represen
tatives: The financial standing of the
nation at tho present tlmo Is excellent,
and the financial management of tho na
tion's Interests by tho government dur
ing tho last seven years has shown the
most satisfactory results. But our cur
rency system Is' Imperfect, nnd It Is ear
nestly to bo hoped that tho currency
commission will bo able to proposo a
thoroughly good system which will do
away with the existing defects.
During tho period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, 190S, thero was an Increase
tn tho amount of money In circulation of
5902,991,393. Tho Increase In tho per capita
during this period was J7.00. Within this
time thero wero several occasions whon
It was necessary for the trensury de
partment to come to tho relief of the
money market by purchases or redemp
tions of United States bonds; by Increas
ing deposits In national banks; by stim
ulating additional Issues of national bank
notes, nnd by facilitating Importations
from abroad of gold. Our Imperfect cur
rency system has mado these proceedings
necessary, and they wero effectlvo until
tho monetary disturbance In the fall of
1907 Immensely Increased tho difficulty of
ordlnnry methods of relief. Dy the mld
Ulo of November the available working
balanco in tho treasury hml been reduced
to approximately J3.000.000. Clearing
liouso associations throughout the coun
try had been obliged to resort to the
expedient of Issuing clearing house cer
tificates, to be used as money. In this
emergency It was determined to Invite
subscriptions for $50,000,000 Pnnama canal
bonds, nnd 1100,000,000 three per cent,
certificates of indebtedness authorized by
tho act of Juno 13, 1S3S. It was proposed
to redcposlt In the national banks the
proceeds of these Issues, nnd to permit
their uso as a basis for additional circu
lating notes of national banks. The
moral effect of this proccduro was so
sreat that It was necessary to Issue only
324.G31.9S0 of the Panama bonds nnd $15.--436,500
of tho certificates of Indebtedness.
During tho period from July 1, 1901, to
September 30, IMS, tho balance between
the net ordinary receipts and the net
ordinary expenses of tho government
-showed a surplus In tho four years 1902.
1903, 10W, nnd 1907, and a deficit In tha
years 1904, 1905, 190S nnd n fractional part
of tho fiscal year 1900. Tho net result
was a surplus of J99.2S3.4 13.51. The finan
cial operations of the government during
this period, based upon these differences
between receipts nnd expenditures, re
sulted In a net reduction of tho Interest
bearing debt of the United States from
4937,111.010 to S97,2f,3,990. notwithstanding
that thero had been two sales of Panama
canal bonds amounting In tho aggregate
to ,$SI,G31,9S0, and an Issue of three per
cent, certificates of indebtedness under
the net of June 13, 1S9S, ninounttng to
915H3G.500. Refunding operations of the
treasury department under tho act of
larch 14, 1900, resulted In the conver
sion Into two per cent, consols of 1930 of
$200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of
Interest. A decrease of vS,CS7.95S In the
annual Interest charge resulted from
these operations.
In short, during the seven years and
three months thero has been a net sur
plus of nearly one hundred millions of
receipts over expenditures, n reduction
of tho Interest-bearing debt by ninety
millions, in spue of me extraordinary ex
pense of the Panama canal, and a saving
of nearly nlno millions on Jthe annual
Interest charge.
Control of Corporations.
As regards the great corporations en
gaged In Interstate business, and espe
cially the railroads, I can only repeat
what I have already again and again said
tn my messages to the congress. I be
lieve that under the Interstate clause of
tho constitution tho United States has
complete and paramount right to con
trol all agencies of Interstato commerce,
and I believe that the national govern
ment alono can exercise. this right with
wisdom and effectiveness so as both to
securo Justice from, and to do Justice to,
the great corporations which arc the
most Important factors In modern busi
ness. I bellevo that It Is worse than
folly to attempt to prohibit all com
binations as Is done ' by the Sherman
anti-trust law, becauso such a law can
be onorced only Imperfectly and un
equally, and Its enforcement works al
most an much hardship as good. I
strongly advocate that Instead of nn un
wise effort to prohibit all combinations,
thero shall bo substituted a law which
shall expressly permit combinations
which are In the Interest of the public,
but shall at tho samo time glvo to some
agency In tho national government full
power of control and supervision over
them. One of tho chief features of this
control should bo securing entire pub
licity in all matters which the public
has a right to know, and furthermore,
tho power, not by judicial but by execu
tive action, to prevent or put a stop to
every form of Improper favoritism or
other wrongdoing.
Tho railways of tho country should be
put completely under tho Intorstato com
merce commission nnd removed from
the domnlu of tho antt-trust law. The
power of the commission should bo made
thoroughgoing, so that It could oxciclse
complete supervision and control over
the Issue of securities as well as over
tho raising and lowering of rates. As
rogards rates, nt least, this power should
bo summary. . . ,' Ratep must bo mado
as low af Is compatible with giving prop
er returns to all tho employes of the rail
road, from tho highest to tho lowest,
And proper rotunvi to tho shareholders,
but troy must not, for Instance, bo re
duced In such fashion as to necessitate
.a cut In tho wnges of tho employes or
the, abolition of tho proper and legitimate
profits of honest shareholders.
TelcgrnpH and tolophono companies en
gaged In Interstate business should be
put under tho jurisdiction of the Inter
state commerce commission.
It Is very earnestly to bo wished that
our people, through their representatives,
.should act In this matter. It Is to
the Interest of all of us that
thero should be a premium put upon in
dividual Initiative and Individual ca
pacity, nnd an ample roward for the
great directing Intelligences alone com
potont to manngo tho great business op
erations of to-day. It Is well to keep In
mind that exactly as tho anarchist Is tho
worst enemy of liberty and tho reaction
ary tho worst enemy of order, so the
men who dofend tho rights of property
have most to fear from tho wrongdoers
of great wealth, and the men who are
championing popular rights have most
to fear from the demagogues who In tho
namo of popular rights would do wrong
to and oppress honost business mon,
honest men of wealth ; for tho success of
cither type of wrongdoer necessarily In
vites a violent reaction against the cause
tho wrongdoer nominally upholds. . . .
Need of Centralization.
The proposal to make the na
tional government supremo over, nnd
therefore to glvo It complete control over,
the railroads and other Instruments of
Interstate commcrco Is merely a propos
al to carry out to tho letter on6 of tho
pflmo purposes, If not tho prlmo purposo,
for which tho constitution was founded.
It docs not represent centralization. It
represents merely tho acknowledgment
of tho patent fact that centralization has
already come In business. If this Irre
sponsible outstdo business power Is to bo
controlled In tho Interest of tho general
public It can only bo controlled In one
way; by giving adequate power of con
trol to tho one sovereignty capable of ex
ercising Buch power tho national govern
ment. To abandon tho effort for national
control menns to abandon tho effort for
all adequato control and yet to render like
ly continual bursts of action by state leg
islatures, which cannot achieve tho pur
pose sought for, but which can do a
great deal of damago to tho corporation
without conferring any real benefit on
the public.
Thero should bo regulation by tho na
tional government of tho great Interstate
corporations. Including a simple method
of account keeping, publicity, supervision
of tho Issue of" securities, abolition of
rebates and of special privileges. Thero
should bo short-time franchises for all
corporations engaged In public business;
Including tho corporations which get
power from water rights. Thero should
be national as well as stato guardianship
of mines and forests. The labor legisla
tion hereinafter referred to should con
currently be enacted Into law.
To accomplish this, moans a certain In
crease In the uso of not tho creation of
power, by the central government. Tho
power already exists; It docs not have
to bo created; tho only question Is
whether It shall be used or left Idle
and meanwhile tho corporations over
which tho power ought to bo exercised
will not remain Idle. Tho danger to Amer
ican democrncy lies not In tho least In tho
concentration of administrative power In
responsible and accountable hands. It
lies In having the power Insufficiently
concentrated, so that no one can be held
responsible to tho people for Its use.
Concentrated power is palpable, visible,
responsible, easily reached, quickly held
to account. Democracy Is In peril
wherever - tho administration of po
litical power Is scattered among
a variety of men who work In
secret, whoso very names nro un
known to tho common people. It Is not
In peril from nny man who derives au
thority from tho people, who exercises
It in sight of tho people, and who Is
from tlmo to time compelled to give an
account of Its cxcrclso to the people.
Legislation for Wageworker.
There nre many matters affecting labor
and tho status of the wageworker to
which I should like to draw your atten
tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the
problem In all its aspects Is not now nec
essary. I bellevo In a steady ef
fort, or perhaps It would bo more
accurate to say in steady efforts
In many different directions, to bring
about a condition of affairs under which
tho men who work with hand or with
brain, tho laborers, tha superintendents,
tho men who produco tha market and tho
men who find a market for tho articles
produced, shall own a far greater share
than at present of tho wealth they pro
duce, and be enabled to Invest It In tho
tools nnd Instruments by which all work
Is carried on. As far as possible I hope
to seo a frank recognition of the advan
tages conferred by machinery, organiza
tion and division of labor, accompanied
by an effort to bring about a larger share
In the ownership by wnge-workcr of rail
way, mill and factory.
Postnl Savings banks will mako it
easy for the poorest to keep their sav
ings In absolute safety. Tho regulation
of tho national highways must be such
that they shall servo all peoplo with
equal Justice. Corporate finances must
bo supervised so as to make It far safer
than at present for tho mnn of small
means to Invest his money In stocks.
Thero must be prohibition of child la
bor. ...mlnuUon of women labor, short
ening of hours of all mechanical labor;
stook watering should be prohibited,
and stock gambling so far as Is possi
ble discouraged. Thero should be a
progressive inheritance tax on largo
fortunes. Industrial education should
bo encouraged. As far as possible wo
should lighten tho burden of taxation
on the small man. Wo should put a
premium upon thrift, hard worlt, and
business onergy; but these qualities
cease to bo tho main factors tn accu
mulating a fortune long before that
fortune reaches a point where It would
bo seriously affected by any Inheri
tance tax sucli as I propose. It Is emi
nently right that the nation should fix
tho terms upon which tho great for
tunes, are Inherited. They rarely do
good nnd they often do harm to those
who Inherit them In their entirety.
Thero should no longer bo any palter
ing with tho question of taking caro of
tho wngoworkers who, under our pres
ent Industrial system, becomo killed,
crippled, or worn out as part of the
regular Incidents of a given busi
ness. As far as concerns those
who havo been worn out, I call your
attention to tho fact that definite
steps toward providing old-ago pen
sions havo been taken In mnny of our
prlvnta Industries. Thcso may bo 'In
definitely extended through voluntary
association and contributory schemes,
or through tho agency of savings
banks, as undor tho Massachusetts
plan.
Urgent Need of Reform.
Our present system, or rather no sys
tem, works dreadful wrong, nnd Is of
benefit to only one class of people tho
lawyers. When a workman Is Injured
what ho needs Is not an expenslvo and
doubtful lawsuit, hut tho certainty of
relief through Immediate administra
tive notion. No academic theory
about "freedom of contract" or "consti
tutional llborty to contrnct" should bo
permitted to Interfere with this nnd
similar movements.
Pending a thoroughgoing Investiga
tion nnd nation thero Is certain legis
lation which should he enacted at once.
The law, passed at tho Inst session of
tho congress .granting compensation to
certain classes or employes of tho gov
ernment .should bo extended to Include
nil employes of tho government and
should be made mora liberal In Its
terms. Thero Is no good ground for
tho distinction mado In tho law be
tween those engaged In hazardous oc
cupations and thosu not so en
gaged. Tho terms of tho act pro
viding compensation should be made
more liberal than In tho present
act. A year's compensation is not ndo
qunto for a wago-earner's family In tho
event of his death by accident In the
course of his employment. And in the
event of death occurring, say, ten or'
oleven months nfter tho accident, tho
family wnuld only recolvo ns compen
sation the equivalent of one or two
months' earnings. In this respect the
gono'roslty of tho United States townrds
Its employes compares most unfavora
bly with that of every country In Eu
ropeoven tho poorest.
I renew my recommendation made tn
a provlous messngo that half-holidays
be granted during summer to all wage
workers In government employ .
I also renow my rccommcndntlon that
tho principle of the eight-hour day
should as rapidly and as far ns practi
cable bo extonded to tho ontlro work
being carried on by tho government;
tho proscnt law should bo amended to
embrace contracts on thoso publlo
works which tho present wording of
tho net seems to exclude
Would Doublo Salaries of Judges.
I most earnestly urgo upon tho con
gress tho duty of Increasing- tho totally
Inadequate salaries now given to our
judges. On the whole there Is no body
of public servants who do as valuablo
work, nor whoso moneyed reward Is so
Inadequate compared to their work, Beginning-
with the supremo court tho
Judges should havo their salaries dou
bled. It Is not befitting the dignity of
tho nation that Its most honored publlo
servants should be paid sums so small
compared to what they would earn In
prtvato life that tho performance of
public scrvlco by them Implies an ex
ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice.
It Is earnestly to bo desired that some
method should bo devised for doing
away with tho long delays which now
obtain In tho administration of justice,
and which oporato with peculiar sever
ity against persons of small means, and
favor only tho very criminals whom It
Is most desirable to punish. Thcso
long delays in tho final decisions of
cases malco in the aggrcgato a crying
ovll; and a remedy shouU be devised.
Much of this Intolerable delay Is duo
to Improper regard paid to technicali
ties which are a mere hlndcrance to
justice. In some noted recent cases this
over-regard for technicalities has re
sulted In a striking denial of Justice,
and flagrant wrong to tho body politic.
Labor Leaders Criticised.
At the last election certain leaders of
organized labor mado a violent and
sweeping attack upon the entire Judi
ciary of tho country, an attack couched
In such terms as to Include the most
upright, honest and broad-minded
judges, no less than thoso of narrower
mind and more restricted outlook.
Last year, before tho houso com
mittee on Judiciary, thso same
labor leaders formulated their de
mands, specifying the bill that
contained them, refusing nil compro
mise, stating they wished the prlnclplo
of that bill or nothing. They Insisted
on a provision that In a labor dlsputo
no Injunction should Issue except to
protect a property right, and specifical
ly provided that tho right to carry on
business should not bo construed as a
property right; and In a second provis
ion their bill mado legal In a labor dls
puto any act or agrcoment by or be
tween two or more persons that would
not have been unlawful If dono by a
single person. In other words, this bill
legalized blacklisting and boycotting
in every form, legalizing, for Instance,
those forms of the secondary boycott
which the anthracite coal strike com
mission so unreservedly condemned;
whllo the right to carry on a business
was explicitly taken out from under
that protection which tho law throws
over property. Tho demand was mado
that there should be trial by Jury In
contempt cases, thereby most seriously
impairing the authority of the courts.
All this represented a course of policy
which. If carried out, would mean tho
enthronement of clnss prlvllcgo In Its
crudest and most brutal form, and tho
destruction of ono of tho most essen
tial functions of the Judilcary In all civ
ilized lands.
The violence of the crusade for this
legislation, and Its complete failure,
illustrate two truths which It Is essen
tial our peoplo should learn. In the
first place, they ought to teach tho
worklngman, tho laborer, the wage
worker, that by demanding what Is im
proper and Impossible ho plays Into the
hands of his foes. Such a rudo and
vicious attack upon tho courts, even If
It wero temporarily successful, would
Inovltably In tho end cause a violent
renctlon nnd would band tho great
mass of citizens together, forcing them
to stand by nil the judges, competent
nnd Incompetent alike, rather than to
see the wheels of Justice stopped.
Tho wngoworkers, the worklngmen,
the laboring men of the country by the
way In which they repudiated tho ef
fort to get them to cast their votes In
response to an nppeal to class hatred,
havo emphasized their sound patriotism
and Americanism. Such nn attitude
Is an object lesson in good citizenship to
tho entire nation.
Judicial System Sound.
Our Judicial system is sound and
offective at core, and It remains,
and must ever be maintained, as
the safeguard of those principles of lib
erty and justice which stand at the
foundation of American Institutions; for,
as Burke finely said, when liberty and
Justlco are separated, neither Is safe.
Thero are, however, some members of
tho Judicial body who have lagged be
hind In their understanding of these
great and vital changes In the body
politic, whose minds have never been
opened to tho new applications of tho old
principles made necessary by tho new
conditions. Judges of this stamp do last
ing hnrm by their decisions, because they
convince poor men In need of protection
that the courts of the land nre pro
foundly Ignorant of and out of sympathy
with their needs, and profoundly Ignorant
or hostile to any proposed remedy. To
such men It seems a cruel mockery to
have any court decide against them on
tho ground that It desires to preservo
"liberty" In a purely technical form, by
withholding liberty In any real and con
structive sense.
There nro certain decisions by various
courts which havo been exceedingly det
rimental to tho rights of wage-workers.
This Is truo of all decisions that decide
that men nre, by the constitution, "guar
anteed their liberty" to contrnct to enter
a dangerous occupation, or to work an
undesirable or Improper number of hours,
or to work In unhealthy surroundings;
and therefore cannot recover damages
when maimed In that occupation, and
cannot bo forbidden to work what the
legislature decides Is an excessive num
ber of hours, or to carry on the work
under conditions which tho legislature
decides to bo unhealthy. Decisions
such as thoso nullify the legislative
orfort to protect the wago-workers who
most need protection from those employ
ers who tnko advantage of their grind
ing need. They hnlt or hamper tho move
ment for securing better and more equl
table conditions of labor.
There Is also, I think, ground for the
belief that substantial Injustice Is often
suffered by employes in consequence of
tho custom of courts Issuing temporary
Injunctions without notice to, them, und
punishing them for contempt of court in
instances whoro, as a matter of fact,
they have no knowledge of any proceed
ings. Organized labor Is chafing
under tho unjust restraint which
comes from repeated resort to this
plan of procedure. Its discontent
has been unwisely expressed, nnd
often Improperly expressed, but there
is a sound basis for It, and the or
derly and law-abiding peoplo of a com
munity would bo In a far stronsor posi
tion for upholding the courts If tho un
doubtedly existing abuses could be pro
vided against,
Injunction Must Remain.
The power of Injunction Is n great
equltnblo remedy, which should on no
account be destroyed, But safeguards
should be erected agnlnst its abuse.
In substanco, provision should bo made
that no injunction or temporary re
straining order lssuo othorwlso than on
notice, oxcept whero Irreparablo Injury
would othcrwlso result; and In such enso
a hearing on tho merits of tho order
should be had within a short fixed pe
riod, nnd, If not then continued after
hoarlng, It should forthwith lapso. De
cisions should bo rendered Immediately,
and tho clmnco of delay minimized In
ovory way. Moreover, I bellevo that the
proccduro should bo sharply defined, and
tho Judge required minutely to stato tho
particulars both of his action and of his
reasons thorefor, so that tho congress
can If It desires oxamlno and Investigate
tho samo.
For many of the shortcomings of
justice In our country our people as a
wholo are thomsclvcs to blame, and tho
Judges and juries merely bear their
sharo together with tho publlo as a
wholo. It Is discreditable to us as a
peoplo that thero should bo difficulty In
convicting murdorcrs, or In bringing to
justlco men who ns public servants
havo been guilty of corruption, or who
have profited by tho corruption of
public servants. Tho result' Is oqunlly
unfortunate, whothor duo to hairsplit
ting technicalities In tho Interpretation
of law by Judges, to sentimentality and
class consciousness on the part of
Juries, or to hysteria and sensational
ism In tho dally press. For much of
this failure of Justlco no responsibility
whatever lies on rich men as such. We
who mako up tho mass of tho people
cannot shift tho responsibility from our
own shoulders. But thero Is an Impor
tant pnrt of tho failure which has spe
cially to do with inability to hold
to proper account men of wealth who
behave badly.
The Modern Corporation.
The liuiro wealth that has bcon accu
mulated by a. few Individuals of recent
years. In what has amounted to a so
cial and Industrial revolution, has been
as regards somo of theso Individuals
mado possible only by tho Improper uso
of tho modern corporation. A certain
typo of modern corporation, with Its
officers and agents, Its many issues of
securities, and Its constant consolida
tion with allied undertakings, finally
bocomes an Instrument so complex as
to contain a greater number of ele
ments that, undor various judicial de
cisions, lend themselves to fraud and
oppression than any device yot evolved
In the human brain. Corporations are
necessary Instruments of modern busi
ness. They have been permitted to
becomo a menace largely because the
governmental representatives of tho
peoplo havo worked slowly In provid
ing for adequate control over them.
Our great clusters of corpora
tions, huge trusts and fabulously
wealthy multimillionaires, employ the
very best lawyers they can obtain to
pick flaws In statutes after their
passage; but they also employ n class
of secret agents who seek, under th'e
advice of experts, to render hostllo
legislation Innocuous by making It un
constitutional, often through the Inser
tion of what nppcnr on their face to bo
drastic and sweeping provisions against
tho Interests of tho parties Inspiring
them; whllo tho demagogues, the cor
rupt creatures who Introduce black
mailing schemes to "strlko" corpora
tions, and all who demand extreme,
and undesirably radical, measures,
show themselves to bo tho worst ene
mies of tho very publlo whose loud
mouthed champions they profess to be.
Real damago has been dono by tho
manifold and conflicting Interpretations
ot the Interstato commerco law. Con
trol over tho great corporations doing
Interstate business can be effective only
If It Is vested with full power In an
administrative department, a branch of
tho federal executive, carrying out a
federal law; it can never bo effective If
a divided responsibility is left in both
tho states and the nation; It can never
be effective If left In tho hands of the
courts to be decided by lawsuits.
Respect for Law Must Be Upheld.
Tho courts hold a place of peculiar and
deserved sanctity under our form of gov
ernment. Respect for tho law Is essen
tial to the permanence of our Institu
tions; and respect for tho law Is largely
conditioned upon respect for tho courts.
It Is an offense against tho republic to
say anything which can weaken this re
spect, save for the gravest reason and In
tho most carefully-guarded manner. In no
other nation In tho world do tho courts
wield such vast and far-reaching power
as In the United States. All that Is nec
essary Is that tho courts as a whole
should exercise this power with the far
sighted wisdom already shown by those
Judges who scan tho future while they
act In tho present. Let them exercise
this great power not only honestly and
bravely, but with wise Insight into tho
needs and fixed purposes of the people,
so that they may do Justice, and work
equity, so that they may protect all per
sons In their rights, and yet break down
tho barriers of privilege, which Is the foe
of right.
Forest Preservation.
If there Is any one duty which more
than another we owe It to our children
to perform nt once, It Is to save tho for
ests of this country, for they constitute
tho first and most important element In
the conservation of the natural re
sources of tho country. . . . Just as
a farmer, after all his life making his
living from his farm, will. If he is an ex
pert farmer, leave It as an asset of In
creased value to his son, so wo should
leave our national domain to our chil
dren, Increased In value and not worn
out. Thero are small sections of our own
country, In the east and In tho west. In
the Adlrondacks, the White mountains
and tho Appalachians, and tn tho Rocky
mountains, where we can already sec for
ourselves the damage In tho shape of
permanent Injury to the soil and tho
river systems which comes from reckless
deforestation. It matters not whether
this deforestation Is duo to the actual
reckless cutting of timber, to the fires
that Inevitably follow such reckless cut
ting of Umber, or to reckless nnd uncon-
tr,11,,,1 rrnln(, nnnf.(ntlv l,v t1, truant
j migratory bands of sheep, the un
checked wandering of which over the
country means destruction to forests and
disaster to tho small home-makers, the
(.ettlers of limited means.
Thanks to our own recklessness
In the uso of our splendid forests,
wo havo already crossed tho verge of a
timber famine In this country, and no
measures that we now take can, at least
for many years, undo tho mischief that
has already been done. But wo can pre
vent further mischief being done; and It
would bo In tho highest, degree reprehen
sible to let any consideration of tem
porary convenience or temporary cost
interfere with such action, especially as
regards the national forests which tho
nation can now, at this very moment,
control.
Tho lesson of deforestation In China
Is a lesson which mankind should have
learned many times already from what
has occurred In other places. Denuda
tion leaves naked soil; then gullying
cuts down to tho bare rock; and mean
while tho rock-wnsto buries tho bottom
lands. When tho soil is gone, men
must go; and tho process docs not take
lontf.
Plea for Inland Waterways.
Action should be begun forthwith, dur
ing tho piesent session of the congress,
for tho improvement of our Inland water
ways action which will result In giving
us not only navigable but navigated
rivers.
Until the work of river Improvement Is
undertaken In a modern wuy It can not
have results that will meet the needs of
this modern nation. The plan
Which promltics tho best and quick
est results Is that ot a per
manent commission authorized to co-or-dlnato
tho work ot all tho government
departments relating to waterways, and
to frame nnd supcrvlso tho execution ot
a comprehensive plan, Under such a.
commission tho actual work ot construc
tion might bo entrusted to the reclama
tion service; or to tho military engineers
acting with a sufficient number of civili
ans to contlnuo tho work In tlmo of war;
or It might be divided between the rec
lamation scrvlco and the corps of cn
Elnecrs. Funds should be provided from
:urrcnt revenues If It Is deemed wise
Jtherwlso from tho salo of bonds. Tho
essential thing Is that the work should
go forward under tho best possible plan,
and with tho least posslblo delay. Tho
tlmo for playing with our waterways Is
post. Tho country demands results.
Tho president urges that national
parks ndjacent to national forests bo
placed under the control of tho forest
Bervlco of tho agricultural depart
ment; ho also points out tho benefits
derived from pure food legislation.
Tho messago continues:
Needs of the Secret Service.
Last year nn nmondment was Incor
porated In the mensuro providing for tho
secret sorvlce, which provided that there
should be no detail from tho secret sorv
lce and no transfer therefrom. Tho
amendment In question was of benefit to
no ono oxccptlng to criminals, and
It seriously hampers tho government In
tho detection of crime and tho securing
of Justice. Tho chief argument In
favor of tho provision was that
the congressmen did not them
selves wish to be Investigated by the
secret scrvlco men. Very little ot such
Investigation has been done In the past;
but It Is truo that tho work of the secret
service agents was partly responsible for
the Indictment and conviction of a sen
ator and a congressman for land frauds
In Oregon. I do not believe that It Is
In tho public Interest to protect criminals
In any branch of tho public service, and
oxactly as wo have again and again dur
ing the past seven years prosecuted and
convicted such criminals who were In
the executive branch of tho government,
so In my belief we should bo given amplo
means to prosecute them If found In the
legislative branch. But If this Is not
considered desirable a special exception
could bo mado In tho law prohibiting tlto
use ot tho secret service force In Inves
tigating members ot tho congress.
Postal Savings Banks.
I again renew my recommendation
for postal savings banks, for deposit
ing savings with tho security of tho
government behind them. The object
Is to encourago thrift and economy In
the wage-earner nnd person of mod
crate means. It Is believed that In tho
aggregate vast sums of money would be
brought Into circulation through tho In
strumentality of the postal 'savings
banks.
Parcel Post.
In my last annual messago I com
mended tho postmaster-general's
recommendation for an extension of tho
parcel post on tho rural routes. The
establishment of a local parcel post on
rural routes would be to tho mutual
benefit of tho farmer and tho country
storekeeper, and It is desirable that the
routes, serving moro than 15,000.000
people, should bo utilized to the fullest
practicable extent.
Education.
With the limited means hitherto pro
vided, the bureau of e ducatlon has
rendered efficient service, but the con
gress has neglected to adequately sup
ply tho bureau with means to meet the
educational growth of tho country.
I earnestly recommend that this un
fortunate state of affairs as regards
tho national educational olfico be reme
died by adequate appropriations. This
recommendation Is urged by tho repre
sentatives of our common schools nnd
great stato universities and tho leading
educators, who nil unlto In requesting
favorablo consideration and action by
tho congress upon this subject.
Tho president points out tho neces
sity of better organization of tho vari
ous bureaus responsible for tho public
health, and urges the placing ot all
soldiers' Homes under the jurisdiction
of the war department.
Statehood.
On the question of statehood the
president says:
I ndvocato tho Immediate admission of
Now Mexico and Arizona as states. This
should be dono at tho present session of
tho congress. Tho peoplo of tho two ter
ritories have made it evident by their
votes that they will not come In as ono
state. Tho only alternative Is to admit
them as two, and I tritst that this will bo
dono without delay.
Interstate Fisheries.
I call the attention ot the congress to
tho Importance of the problem of tha
fisheries In the Interstate waters. On the
Great Lakes wo 'are now, under tho very
wlso treaty of April 11 of this year, en
deavoring to come to an International
agreement for the preservation nnd sat
isfactory uso of tho fisheries of theso wa
ters which can not otherwise be achieved.
Lake Erie, for example, has the richest
fresh water fisheries in the world; but It
Is now controlled by tho statutes of two
nations, four Btatcs, and ono province.,
and this provlnco by two different ordi
nances In different counties. All theso
political divisions work at cross pur
poses, and in no case can thoy achieve
protection to tho fisheries, on tho one
hand, and Justice to tho localities and in
dividuals on the other.
Foreign Affairs.
This nation's foreign policy Is based
on the theory that right must be done
between nations precisely as between
Individuals, and In our actions for tho
last ten years wo havo In this matter
proven our faith by our deeds. Wo
havo behaved, and are behaving, to
wnrds other nations, as in private llfo
an honorable man would behave to
wurds his fellows.
Latin-American Republics.
The commercial and material prog
ress of the 20 Latin-American republics
is worthy of tho careful attention nf
tho congress. Tho International Bureau
ot tho American Republics Is doing a
useful work in making thcso nations
nnd their resources better known to
us, nnd in acquainting them not only
with us ns a peoplo and with our pur
poses towards them, but with what we
have to exchange for their goods,
Panama Canal.
The work on the Panama canal Is .be
ing done with a speed, efficiency and
entire dovotlon to duty, which mako It
u model for all work ot the kind. The
men on tho Isthmus, from Col. Qoothnls
nnd his fellow commissioners through
tho entire list of omployes who nro
faithfully doing their duty, havo won
their right to the ungrudging respect
and gratitude of tho American poople.
Ocean Mall Lines,
I again recommend tho extension of
tho ocean mail act of 1S91 so that satis
factory American ocean mall lines to
South America, Asia, tho Philippines,
and Australasia may bo established.
Hawaii.
I call particular attention to tho Ter
ritory ot Hawaii. Tho Importance ot
thoso Islands Is apparent, nnd tha need
of Improving their condition and de
veloping their resources Is urgent.
The Philippines,
Real progress toward Bclf-government
Is being mado In the Philippine Islands.
I trust that within a generation
tho time will arrive when tho Philippines
can decide for themselves whether It -is
well for thorn' to become Independent, or
to contlnuo under the protection of hi
strong nnd disinterested power, nblo to
guarantee to tho Islands order nt home
and protection from foreign Invasion.
Porto Rico.
I again recommend that American cit
izenship be conferred upon tho peoplo ot
Porto Rico.
Cuba.
In Cuba our occupancy will cease In
about two months' tlmo; tho Cubans
havo In orderly manner elected their own
governmental authorities, nnd tho Island
will bo turned over to them. Our occu
pation on this occasion has lasted n llt
tlo over two yenrs, and Cuba has thriv
en nnd prospered under It. Our earnest
hopo nnd ono dcslro Is that tho peoplo
of tho Island shall now govern them
selves with justice, so that pcaco and or
der may bo secure.
Japanese Exposition,
Tho Jnpnncso government has post
poned until 1917 tho date of the great
Intcrnnttonnl exposition, tho action be
ing taken so ns to Insuro nmplo tlmo
In which to prepare to make the expo
sition all that It should bo mado. Tho
American commissioners havo visited
Japan and tho postponement will moro
ly glvo ampler opportunity for Ameri
ca to bo represented nt tho exposition.
Not slnco the first International expo
sition has thero been ono of grcntcr
importance than this will be, marking,
ns It does, tho fiftieth annlvorsary of
tho ascension to tha throne of tho em
peror of Japan. Tha extraordinary
leap to tho foremost place among tho
nations of tho world made by Japan
during this half century Is something
unparalleled in all previous history.
I tako this opportunity publicly to
state my appreciation of the way In
which In Japan, In Australia, In New
Zealand, and In nil tho stntcs of South
Amcrlcn, tho battle fleet has bocn re
ceived on Its practlco voyage nround
tho world. Tho American government
can not too strongly express Its appre
ciation of the abounding nnd generous
hospitality shown our Bhlps In every
port they visited.
The Army.
As regards tho army I call attention
to tho fact that whllo our Junior offi
cers and enlisted men stand very high,
tho present system of promotion by
seniority results In bringing into tho
higher grades many mon of mediocre
capacity who havo but a short tlmo to
serve. No man should regard It as his
vested right to rlso to tho highest rank
In tho army any moro than In any
other profession. It is a curious and
by no means creditable fact that thero
should bo so often a falluro on tho
part of tho public and Its representa
tives to understand tho great need,
from tho standpoint of tho service and
tho nation, ot refusing to promote re
spectable, elderly Incompetents. Tho
higher places should bo given to tho
most deserving men without regard to
seniority; at least seniority should bo
treated as only one consideration. In
tho stress of modern Industrial com
petition no business firm could succeed
If thoso responsible for Its managoment
woro chosen simply on the ground that
thoy were the oldest people In Its em
ployment; yet this Is tho course advo
cated as regards the army, and re
quired by law for all grades except
thoso of general officer. As a matter
of fact all ot tho best officers In tho
highest ranks of tho army are those
who havo attained their present posi
tion wholly or In part by a process of
selection.
Tho scope of retiring boards should
bo extended so that they could con
sider general unfitness to command for
any cause, In order to secure (V far mora
rigid enforcement than at present In
tho elimination of officers for mental,
physical or temperamental disabilities.
But this plan Is recommended only If
tho congress does not seo fit to provide
what In my judgment Is far better.
that Is, for selection In promotion, and
for elimination for age. OfTlcers who
fall to attain a certain rank by a cer
tain age. should be retired for In
stance, If a man should not attain
field rank by tho tlmo he Is 45 ho
should of course be placed on tho re
tired list. General officers should bo
selected ns at present, and one-third
ot tho other promotions should be
made by selection, tho selection to bo
made by tho president or secretary of
war from a list of at least two candi
dates proposed for each vacancy by a
board ot officers from tho arm of tho
servlco trom which tho promotion Is
to bo made. A bill Is now before the
congress having for Its object to so
curo tho promotion of officers to vari
ous grades at reasonablo ages through
a process ot selection, by boards of of
ficers, of tho least efficient for retire
ment with a percentago of their pay
depending upon length of service. The
bill, although not accomplishing all
that should bo done, is a long step in
tho right direction; and. f earnestly
recommend its passage, or that of a
moro completely effective measure.
National Guard.
Now that the organized militia, the
National Guard, has been Incorporated
with tho army as a part of tho national
forces. It behooves tho government to
do every reasonable thing in Its power
to perfect Its efficiency. It should be
assisted in its Instruction and other
wise aided moro liberally than hereto
fore. Tho continuous services of many
well-trained regular officers will be
essential In this connection. A
bill Is now pending before tho
congress creating a number of extra
officers In the army, which if passed,
as It ought to be, will enable more
officers to bo trained ns Instructors of
National Guard and assigned to that
duty. In case of war it will be of the
utmost Importance to havo a large
number of trained officers to use for
turning raw levies Into good troops.
The Navy.
I approve the recommendations of
the general board for tho In
crease of tho navy, calling especial
attention to tho need of addi
tional destroyers and colliers, and abovo
all, of tho four battleships. It Is desir
able to complete as soon as pos3lblo a
squadron ot eight battleships of tho best
existing type.
I most earnostly recommend that the
general board be by law turned Into a
general staff. There Is literally no ex
cuse whatever for continuing tho pres
ent bureau organization of the navy. The
navy should bo treated as a purely mili
tary organization, and everything should
be subordinated to tho ono object of se
curing military efficiency. A system
of promotion by merit, either by selec
tion or by exclusion, or by both
( processes, should bo introduced. It Is out
of tho question. If tho present principle
of promotion by mere seniority Is kept,
to expect to got tho best results from the
higher officers. Our men come too old,
nnd stay for too short a time, In the high
command positions.
Nothing better for tho navy from every
standpoint has ever occurred than tha
cruiso st the buttla licet around tho
world. The Improvement of tho ships In
every way has been extraordinary, and
they havo gained far moro experience
tn battle tactics than they would havo
gained If they had stayed in tho Atlantic
waters. Tho American people havo cause
for profound gratification, both In view
ot tho excellent condition of tho fleet as
shown by this cruise, and In view of the
improvement the cruiso has worked In
this already high condition. I do not
bellevo that thero Is any other service In
tho world In which tho avcrago of char
actor and efficiency In tho enlisted men
13 as high as Is now tho case In our own.
