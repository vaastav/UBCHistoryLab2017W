constantly getting the better of his shrewd
ness. Certainly, there never was tretter
material for the hangman than that which
Guiteau furnishes, His lack of logic is by
no means related to irresponsibility' for
crime. It only proceeds from that egre
gious vanity, that lack of mental and mor
al training, that cheerful blinking of incon
venicnt fuets and that airy inconsequence
whiclvif Guiteau had not been diverted
into murder, would have made him almost
fit to write political leaders for a New

the affairs of the party of great moral ideas.

The question of tariff is tbe one now com
ing up before the country for active discua-
j sion, and it will be the engrossing dispute f er
the naxt few years. It is the most import-
ant one now attracting public attention
and will be sharply contested. On the
j one 6ide are arrayed the manufacturer 8 of
protected goods and their actions at their
late conventions show they have become
more impudent and aggressive than ever.
On the other the great body of the people
the consumers who are taxed to support
the others. On this question the democrat
ic party will take a decided stand and in
stead of looking at the plank; "a tariff for
revenue onl v" as a mistake will adopt it
as their main line of attack. In tbe West
Oief question; whether the farmers, the me
chanics, the merchants, the laborers, the
citizens generally are willing to be taxed to
an extent of paying nearly or quite double
That part of , the President's message
which relates to civil service reform has
proved a blessing of untold value to many
a once half-breed newspaper. Ever since
Garfield's death they have seen with en
vious eyes the hundred thousand offices in
the hands of the other fellows, and they
have pondered long and prayerfully how
they could repent the error of their ways
and join the stalwarts and their offices.
Gladly would they have done , this, and
quickly, but one obstacle lay in their path;
it must be done with some show of con
sistency, and must impress the other fac
tion as genuine. The great bugbear . was
civil service reform; it was an apparition
that would not down an impediment always
in their path. When Hayes first conceived it
they bad applauded,and when he had made
application of its principles on Arthur.then
collector they had howled with delight;
that application seemed to them most fit
ting, the kick that- sent Arthur tumbling
out of the Custom House was to save the
country. , .
liut now Arthur is President, and as
these Whilholm half-breeds look hungrily
up to him fer some little political pap in
the shape of federal offices, they remem
ber with sorrow and chagrin their utter
ances of a few years., back, and
tremble for the consequences. - His
record as Vice President they can easfly
swallow and all their then articles explain,
but how can they get around ; their oft
repeated statements that he and his princi
ples of political actions are the greatest
obstacles in the way of civil service reform.
The task seemed hopeless and many of
them had about made up their, mind to.
continue far away from the throne, where
Arthur himself furnishes the opening. In
his message he declares for -civil service
reform;, what a glorious opportunity it
was ! To be sure during his entire official
career he had never by a single action
given proof of such a desire; he had never
made a single appointment for other than
political motives; during the very time
that he was penning those lines of his mes
sage he was making in Virginia appoint
ments and removals with no other object
in view than the success of the repudiation
republican coalition in that state; but
he has (in words) declared for civil service
reform and himself a civil service reformer.
The once half-breeds are delighted; they
know it is so for "he himself has said it,"
and they hail it us a joyful omen, an ex
cuse wherehv thev can declare their alle
nor is there any prospect that the old ys
tern of official stealing which took such
strWg root under Grant, and, as the later
developihehts show, was nourished aftd"
continued . under . the hypocritical and
fraudulent Haves, will not be maintained
as lonsr as repoblicans rule.
trTHunC wno will soon go into per
manent retirement, &as just proposed raid
pa the Treasury for a new navy. t Cen-
tracts Tor millioiis will have to be given
ut if that policy should be ' accepted;: and
the indications are strong that a majority
of this Republican Hous :will approve
some scheme for reconstructing the navy,
probably on a considerable scale, .
To ; make KobesOn, tainted, as he is,
Chairman of the committee which will have
the shaping of the intended legislation
would he little less than an open announce
ment that public robbry is now to be open
ly encouraged by the Republica ns.
. Several of the. older coruptionists have
been returned to this Congress, and are
now occupying conspicuous seats on the
Republican side of the House of Re pre sen
tatives. JV, Y. Sun. . .
President Arthur told the republican
Caucus committee of the Virginia Legisla
ture that as a coalition had been formed
in Virginia he must decline to talk. Inas
much as that condition was formed with
his active sympathy and without his cor
dial support could never have been suc
cessful, such an utterance is hypocracy of
a character too deep for a common mortal
to righfully appreciate. He would not
talk to them officially as a committee but
let them come as individuals and he would
give suitable encouragement, is what can
be read between the lines.
