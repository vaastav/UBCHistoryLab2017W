have been wanting. Statistics of the value of each railroad would be val

upon the power of the interstate railroads to issue stocks and bonds, as I
hope we may.
Btanding of the facts, it would be wise to make a reasonable appropriation to
enable the interstate commerce commission to proceed with due dispatch
to the valuation of all railroads. I have no doubt that railroad companies
themselves can and will greatly facilitate this valuation and make it
much less costly in time and money than has been supposed."

WHERE THE PROFIT GOES
The case of California ought to be instructive to those communities
that think they can get more out of a protective tariff than it will cost
them.
Very possibly California contains more people who are actually inter
ested in the maintenance of a protective tariff than any other state in the
union.

Dalton, Ga., Dec. 13.—Jhst like Hi

of those who save trains is the one j
from here in which old Mrs. Saylor,
going home from a neighbors, about
12 miles south of town, played a part
the other night.
Passengers on the Southern's Flor

selves for supper in the diner last
night when suddenly their consomm
was dashed into their laps, as the
brakes ground against thewheels and
the heavy train slowed to an emer
gency stop. But the homeward bound
tourists who began swearing over the
mishap changed the tenor of their re
marks when they learned the reason
of the sudden stop.
Old Mrs. Saylor was walking along
the track, and when she found
broken rail just beyond a sweeping
curve in the track she knew the lim
ited, due from Atlanta in a few mo
ments, would go crashing over the
embankment unless a warning came
in time.
Airs. Saylor picked up her skirts and
ran for her home, stumbling over the
rough path and arriving out of breath
and excited,

lantern and the two ran back to the
curve and far around it. Just as they
reached the straight stretch they were
