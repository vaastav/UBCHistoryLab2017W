Mess In OrauKcra,
New York, Dec. 7.?Speculation at the
Stock Exchange was held in abeyance
during the greater part of the day by
the desire to defer operations until the
contents of the President's message to
Congress became known. Until the do*
tails of the message became public
property the dealings were of a hand-to
mouth character, and were confined
mainly to the room traders. At the
start the sales were generally at small
concessions from Saturday's final
figures. Tobacco and Manhattan were
notable exceptions, the former selling
off l%to 73% and the latter l'i to ?5%.
Tobacco was unfavorably Influenced by
rumors of fresh competition and by re?
ports that a decision In the New Jersey
coufts affecting the charter of the com?
pany would be rendered shortly and
would be adverse to the trust. Shortly
after the opening General Electric ran
up 1% to 33% and Laclede Gas 2% to
25%. In sympathy with these move?
ments the leading shares improved 'J/n
1 per cent., but the advance was soon
partially lost.
The really decisive movement of the
'day took place shortly before 2 o'clock,
?when the details of the President's mes?
sage became known in the street. The
reference to the trusts wns followed by a
Vigorous selling movement In Sugar,
which carried that stock down from
1161?. The fact that the Sugar Trust
declared the usual Quarterly dividends
on the preferred and common stocks
was Ignored by the trading element, who
sold freely on the way down. There was
also marked weakness in the Grangers,
which declined anywhere from Is to i-%
per cent., the latter in St. Paul and Bur
llgton and Qulncy. Consolidated Gas
declined 1*?, but outside of this special?
ty the losses from the highest of the
morning were % to 1% per cent. The
market closed unsteady at or near the
lowest prices of the day. Net changes
show declines of Vt&lY* per cent.. Man?
hattan leading. Total sales were 202.304
?hares. Including 35.900 Sugar, 25,200
Union Pacific. 18,500 St. Paul. 12,400 Bur?
lington and 12.400 Manhattan.
The bond market was weak. The
?ales footed up $1,741,000.

Chicago, .Dec. 7.?The wheat market
acted weak to-day, but the total decline
established early in the session was
partially recovered later. The market
opened weak at a decline of from l'i
to 1% cents from Saturday: declined %
cent to SO for May, and after various
ups and downs, which were agreeable to
?Oalplng operations, finally rested at the
lowest opening price. 80%C. for May.
The market for corn opened weak,
and under the effect of dullness and of
the depressed tone of wheat, wa.s una?
ble to make much progress in the way
of recovery.
As lower prices were prevalent in the
other grains, oats naturally prea tntcd a
declining tendency.
Provisions?The fust Importation from
