LESSON NO. 12 ,
Adjustment of Interest
FRIDAY, DEC. 7, 1917.
GOOD BYE LATIN! : ;v':
ATIN WAS once the ' language of educated men. ' Men
either read and "wrote; in Latin, or did not do either.
j Education is theabi(iijag place, of stability. Education is the
conservator of wMf has been accomplished. ' So Latin became a
j part of the higheeducation, -and for' many a long century every
man who came into or passed out of a university had his two or
three years of Latin.. . . ''' '
But modern education is a different thing. The wisdom
;tie Latin recorded is largely a dead wisdom, and whether the
' wisdom -of it is dead or alive, it may be much more readily
; acquired from Latinrtranslations ' made' by accomplished
! scholars. "". v ;:", .;
; . The state universities of the United States of America do
j not for the most part require Latin as a condition of the Bache
j lor of Arts degree! 'But most of the endowed colleges do, prob
! &baly because the endowed, colleges are older than the state
1 colleges and more bound by tradition. -
I Among the American colleges deeply attached to the Latin
i is Harvard, but here in its stronghold the dead tongue receives
a wound that will probably prove mortal. , -
Charles W. Eliot, in a publication, issued by the General
Education Boards denounces this waste of energy.
"Thew was a time" he says, ."when the chief part of the
worn, or universities was training scholarly young men for ser
vice of the Churchj the Bar, the State and all such men needed,
' were believed tos need, an intimate knowledge of Latin, and
I Greek; but now, jjmcfJor more than a hundred years, universi-
lies are called to, train young men: for -public' service in new
aemocraciea, for a new medical profession, and for finance,
jonmabjsm, transportation, manufacturing, the new architec
j tare, the bufldmg of vissels and railroads and the direction of
; the great public wor.wchimprove agriculture; conserve the
! national resources, provide, pure Water- supplies, distributalight,
heat and mechanical power. The practitioners of these new
I professions can profit in many directions by so many other
i studies in youth that they ought not indiscriminately . to -be
obliged to study Latin." U ; - . -.V 'V; ". '.
t These are true' and timely words. ' ' . But. they might be
stronger. The study of Latin is mostly a waste of human ener
gy. A few specialists might be excepted. !,: ;
( The study of Latin, is probably in a measure an injury
- to a modern youthful mmd, for the reason that the brain, in its
most plastic years, is filled with a mass ,pf things that are not
'. so. The deep and .cpntinued study of. . dead conditions, dead
ideals and dead statecraft is not more reasonable than to sub
ject the same youths indiscriminately, to three years in the
study ox dead .bodies.

STATE WITNESS
III ASSAULT CASE
DOES NOT APPEAR
Absence of an Important tnltness,
'Vltbout -whom Juflge-Greena said the
case ought not to go on, halted the
. tTl4 of John Carara oi Banbury, aor
" cused of assault with Intent to -mur-tfler,
in the Superior Court, today.
' Judge Greene excused the Jury 'until
11 o'clock Tuesday morning;, after
cautioning: thorn not to tajk about the
case. Carara Is accused of shooting
Charles Betoro of Danburythe evening
of October it last In Danbury, the
only excuse he had for the shooting,
' according to the allegations of the
; elate, being that Setoro owed him 16
cents. Carara took a shotgun, and,
'' while Setoro was stooping down near
an automobile he drives for the Hotel
Orten, placed it at Setoro's head and
fired. . ' .y ''.,-.
Only a slight turn of the head by
Betoro saved his Vie, and he was
severely, injured, the shofpenetrat.
ing the side of his face, knocking out
Beveral teeth, and also penetrating
the left eye of which he has lost the
slg-ht.
Carara alleged that Setoro owed
Mm a small sum of money, and1 had
lunted him with having acted as a
pacemaker in a light in which Se
i ro's brother was engaged. Follow
ing the shooting Carara swallowed &
doantlty of muriatic acid, but 4t was
weai, ana did not have the desired
enect. ' . -
On the witness stand in his own be
half Carara admitted the shooting,
said he- had planned it for a month,
and told such a story that it aroused
suspicion of insanity upon the part
ui mo at&ie-s attorney and also in the
nana or tne Judge. ;
during the night at request of Pub
lic ueienaer DeForest, Dr. C. C. God
frey examined Carara as to his san
ity, but the halting of the trtaJ A.
layed the presentation of his report
uuui xuesaay.
Setoro is not the only one for whom
carara naa a grudge, and in the ten.
timony1 of Policeman Edward Stream
mat omcer said Carara had threaten
ed to get Juflge John R. Booth, who
bound him over to the Superior Court,
and others who were connected with
tne prosecution of the case.
xmnng tne trial yesterday after.
noon Setoro, who is much disflirured
was standing in the court room, and
looking toward Carara. When the
latter saw his victim looking at him
,he' grinned. with glee,-as he Is quoted
as saying, "I intended to hit the
mouth tnat taunted me." '
secretary McAdoo : named . two
women as members of the Liberty
Lioan committee. ,
Twenty-eight recruits were obtained
at Madison Square Garden during the
bike race.
The resolution declaring war on
Austria will come up In the House the
first thing today.
Tou may remember that we said in
one of the earlier lessons that you
could convert your S 1-2 per, cent,
bond into a 4 per cent, bond on or be
fore Nov. 15, 1917 without any "ad
justment of interest," and that there
would be another such opportunity
on December 15. We promised to ex
plain that phrase '"adjustment of In
terest,", and we shall do so at thlsr
time.
If a man owes you six dollars and
hands yon a ten dollar bill to pay his
debt you "have to give him four dol
lars to balance the account
Now an adjustment of interest is
just a case of making change. A cou
pon 'bond consists of two main parts
first, a sheet of paper called the face
of the bond and second, one or more
sheets of little-coupons, each one of
which is good for six months' interest.
Now suppose a man buys a certain
bond, with Coupons coming due on
the first days of January and July.
He holds this bond for a few years,
collecting his interest regularly, and
then some year around the first of
March, he needs some money and sells
his bond.. He gets a certain price
for it, but . what is he going, to do
about the interest on his money for
the months of January and Febru
ary? Of course, he can cut that little
coupon into two pieoea of different
sizes, but the trouble', is the banks
won't take a piece of a coupon. They
Insist on having the wholo coupon or
none at all.
The only fair way out of the diffl
culty.i therefore, is for the man who
buys the bond to pay over to the sell
er the amount of interest which his
money has earned during those two
months. He then receives th bond
with aU of the unmatured coupons at
tached, including the one which
comes due in July of that year. On
the first day of July he cuts off the
coupon and collects a full six months
interest, thus receiving back the two
months interest which he advanced to
the other man, and also having, re
ceived .interest for the entire four
months during which his money has
been Invested in that bond.
In other words, he has just made
change. And the government will ex
pect you to make change in a similar
way if you convert your 3 1-3 per
cent, bond into a ,4 per cent, bond
unless you do it on December 15 next.
Yon need not make an adjustment of
interest on that date for the follow
ing reason.
The law under which the 4 per
cent. Liberty Bonds were Issued pro
vided that they should be dated Nov.
15, 1917 and should bear interest at
4 per cent, from that date. In order,
therefore, to make conversion as sim
ple as possible, the government has
prepared a. special coupon to repre
sent the first interest; payment which
will be made on December 15 next on
the 4 per cent, bonds which a per-
Bon gets in exchange for his 3 1-2 per
cent, bonds. This coupon will be dif
ferent from all the others which are
attached to the bond. It will be for
an amount , of money' representing
3 1-2 per cent.- from June 15, 1917
up to Nov. 15, 1917, and 4 per cent.
Interest from Nov. 15," 1917 to Dec,
16, 1917. ;
Now on Dec. 15 the coupon on the
original 3 1-2 per cent, bond Will fall
due, and also that queer coupon on
the 4 per -cent bond which you get
in exchange will fall due. One who
converts on that date, therefore, will
simply cut the first .coupon from his
3 1-2 per cent, hond and cash It, turn
ing in to the government the bond
with all the rest of the coupons at
tached. He will receive from the
government a 4 per cent, bond from
which the. first coupon, has likewise
been cut, so that the next coupon
which he will be able to cut from his
new 4 per cent, bond will be the. one
which falls due on June 15, 1913.
Now If you want to convert some
time between today and December 15,
19J.7 you will have to pay the gov.
ernment the difference between Inter
est at 4 per cent., and interest at 3 1-2
per cent, from November 16 to the
day on which you decide to convert.
For example, suppose you decide to
convert on December IS. Tou will
have to pay the government 28 days
Interest. ' This interest' will -amount
to 38c on . a $1,000 bond; 19c on a
$500 bond; 4c on a $100 bond and
2c on a $50 bond. '
In this way you will be treated ab
solutely fair. Your money will have
been. workingV for you at 3 1-2 per
cent, up to the day you convert, and
at 4 per cent, from then on. In order,
however, for you to receive this ab
solutely correct adjustment iOf what
Is due to you it will be necessary for
you to make actual request for an ex
act adjustment of .interest, such re
quest to bie on a printed form pre
pared by the government. If you do
not make such a request the bond
which the government will give you
will have as its first coupon one which
bears only 3,1-2 per cent for the full
6 months from June 15, 1917 to Dec.
16, 1917. After Dec. 16, 1917 the cou
pons will, of course, all be at the rate
of 4 '.per cent. '
We have -not yet discussed conver
sion after December 15, 1917. Sup
pose you decide to - convert on the
first day of next March. Your money
will have been invested in a 3 1
per cent, bond up till that date, and
will be entitled to interest at 3 1
per cent, from December 15, 1917 to
the day on whlcty you convert. After
that you will be entitled to interest
at 4 per cent.- Remember, ' however,
that the bond which the government
will give you on March 1 will have
attached to it a coupon representing
full six months interest at 4 per cent.
from December 16, 1917 to June 15
1918. You will not, however, be en
titled to this full six months' interest
at 4 per cent. You must therefore
pay to the government the difference
between 4 per cent, interest and 3 1
per cent. Interest from December 1
Up to March 1. In other words, there
will be a certain fixed sum which you
will have to pay to the government
to make this matter of accumulated
interest fair to everybody concerned
All today's discussion has been
about coupon bonds. Next time we
shall take up the conversion of regis
tered bonds, and incidentally will dis
cuss the advantages and disadvan
cages of coupon and registered bonds

AUSTRIANS WANT
TO BECOME U. S.
CITIZENS NOW
Apprehensive that the United State
will soon declare war on Austria In
accordance with the recommendation
of the message read by President
Wilson to Congress Tuesday, subjects
of Charles, Emperor of Austria and
Apostolic King of Hungary, are
rushing to the office of the clerk of
the United States court to declare
their intention to become citizens of
the United States.
Many of theiri have the belief that
by making declaration of Intention
they are removed from 1 the enemy
alien class In the event of a declara
tlQn of war, but that Is not true.
Despite the declaration they continue
as alien subjects as before . they de
clared their intentions ' and will so
continue until such time as they ap
pear In the United States court and
are declared by Judge Edwin 8.
Thomas as some other- federal judge
to be naturalised cltzens of the United
States. -
Before one can be naturalized,
residence of five years in this coun
try is necessary, but regardless of the
length of residence in this country,
one cannot be naturalized Inside of
two years from the time the declara
tion of intention is made. While the
two .years, after the declaration of
intention are accruing, the status of
the one declaring the intention to be
come a citizen of' this country is not
changed and he continues a subject
of his home government as before.
Consequently in the event of -the
declaration of war subject of Charles.
Emperor of Austria and . Apostolic
King of Hungary, In so far as their
status in this country is concerned
will be in the alien enemy class.
When a man's only ostensible
source of livelihood at this time is
standing up On a soap box and exer
cising his jaws, there is a suspicion
as to where the money for his sup
port comes

FIRST WOMAN SMOKER-
The first European woman to form
the habit of smoking tobacco wa
Mary Frith, better known to her con
temporaries as MOll put-Purse, who
was born on this date In 1565. In
her time pockets were- not yet , In
vented, and gentlemen carricJ their
money la pursos w tut the girdle.
"Moll Cut-Purse" early because an
of pnrses without the knowledge of
their owners. She wore men's cloth
ing, and like the pickpockets of today,
usually carried on her operations
with a "mob."' One of her assistants
attracted the attention of the victim
by jostling him, while Mary Frith cut
the purse strings and handed the
purse to another confederate, . who
made away with it IsXer in life she
became a highway woman, and held
up travelers along . English ' roads.
Despite her dishonest methods of
making a living, she was good heart
ed, divided her spoils liberally with,
those in need, and was a devoted ad
herent of the Cavalier cause. In an
cient prints she is usually pictured
smoking a pipe, and she was un
doubtedly the first white female to
publicly proclaim her allegiance to
Lady Nicotine. . On one occasion she
caused the downfall of a notorious
band of what would now be called
"white slavers," and rescued a youug
girl from their clutches. She lived to
be nearly SO, and left a will request
ing that the remainder of her fortune
be spent In merrymaking ti. try
funeral. .
