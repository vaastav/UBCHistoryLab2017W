!; London. Deo. 5. President Wil
son's message to congress gave power
ful Impetus today to the American
plan for a complete open, frank and
Jbtnt re-statement of allied war aims.
' The Daily News' editorial comment
'practically endorsed that plan. Other
, newspapers, joining in the general
ichorus of hearty approval of the
jwhole tone of the Wilson address, in
'dicated their belief in the necessity for
;a re-pledging of the hosts of democ
racy. i As stated exclusively in these dis
(pntches a short time ago. Colonel
(House is known to have presented to
.British officials President Wilson's
,yrgent suggestion for a sorting of war
aims, a compilation of these to which
fevery ally could subscribe, a discard
ing, of these to which all could not
pledge their force and finally issu
ance of a joint pledge by the allies of
composite war aims. The matter pre
sumably was taken up in the Paris
inter-allied councils but was tempo
rarily put aside for more phvsical war
. .toeasures. Judging from the recep
tion of President Wilson s address to
;oay. the plan will be brought to the
.lore today.

'v The Daily News comment today
was practically an endorsement of the
American repledging plan.

j;L"M wou,d be affectation to pretend
hat the speech echoes the declara

ial continued. "His vision compre
hends the world: theirs only half."
I The Times still refused today to
agree with the president's differentia
tion between the German government
'and the German people.
. "President Wilson." the Thunderer
'said,, "has restated the allies' purpose
with uncompromising force. With a
straightforward statement of war

"As a reaffirmation of previous war
Utterances, the speech is of first class
importance," asserted the Chronicle.
I . "Clear, far-sighted and statesman
like.' was the Express opinion.
Practically every editorial referred
to the message as the most emphatic
announcement of America's determin
ation to wage war to the limit. The
President's recommendation that war
he declared on Austria was regarded
.as one further providence of this in
flexible domination.
;THRUTOSSUM SUPPER
Walnut High School Raises More
'.' Than $ fOO for Soldiers.
! Walnut, Kan.. Dec. 5. The high
school at Walnut, Kan., took rather a
'unique plan for raising the money for
the soldier boys' fund, gome hunters
reported many opossums in the tim
iber and one suggested that the cook
ing class serve an old fashioned "pos
Bum supper." The people of the sur
'rounding country began offering pro
vlsions and other kinds of help. As a
result the school prepared a supper
'with opossum as the chief meat.
The weather was stormy, but In
1 spite ot that the tables were crowded
Ia.Il the evening and many could not be
served. Over $100 was raised for the
fund and will be se..t to the Y. M. C.
A. and Knights of Columbus. The
-school has pledged $230, the remain
: der of which will be secured by per
.sona! subscriptions and class enter

PRICES IN TOPEKA
Fuel Administrator Sets Price
for Coal in This City.
Several Reductions Ordered by
Danner Effective Today.
Changes in prices of coal in Topeka
were announced for today by C. H.
Danner, chairman of the Shawnee
county fuel administration committee.
Danner's new order directs several re
ductions and provides for increases in
rates on domestic nut and fuel from
the Osage county fields. The order is
based on the showing of federal prices
at the mines, freight and cost of
handling.
While a complete classification of
prices is made by Danner, the fuel ad
ministration reserves the right to
make changes without formal hear
ings and at such time as conditions
are held to justify. Where purchasers
provide for their own deliveries, a
gross margin of $1.50 a ton will be
permitted on -all classes of coal.
Where the retailer makes delivery,
the margin will be held to $2 a tori,
except on anthracite and semi-anthracite,
where the margin is listed
at $2.50.
Under the Danner order Arkansas
anthracite is reduced from $14 to
$13.24. Arkansas Bernice is increased
from $13.25 to $13.49. Arkansas semi
anthracite is reduced from $9.25 to
$9.23. Oklahoma semi-anthracite is
reduced from $10.15 to $10.13. South
ern Kansas is reduced from $7 to $6.82
and $6.67. Southern Kansas nut is
reduced from $6.50 to $6.49, and in
some instances to $.34. Osage and
Burlingame coal is increased under
the order from $7 to $7.49.
LA FOLLETTE AN IMAGE
Washington, Dec. 5. Senator La
Follette sat like a graven image in
the house Tuesday as President Wilson
delivered his war message. He did
not applaud at any time, did not rise
when other members did.
Not a senator would walk with La,
Follette from the senate to the house.
Others marched in pairs. La Follette
walked alone. He took a seat within
twenty feet of the president. No one
took throne next to Iiim. This seat
remained vacant until almost every
other chair in the house was filled.
Then an usher took Harry S. New,
of Indiana, to the place and the
Hoosier senator sat down beside La
Follette. The Wisconsin, Senator sat
with his chin cupped in hij hand from
start to finish of the message. At its
conclusion he stalked out defiantly
alone.

same time the president sought to
swerve Russia to unreserved support
of the allied cause.
Truth Antidote for Intrigue.
And as if speaking to America's al
lies in the war, the president stated
that the only antidote to the poison
of falsehood that is keeping the Rus
sians and Germans in the dark, is the
truth.
"It cannot be uttered too plainly or
too often," he pointedly asserted.
TTltimatery Must Crash Germany.
If the German people are unable to
respond to the political offensive di
rected against their rulers and the
German government does not coun
ter the American stateftient of war
aims with a declaration recanting ar
rogant ambitions of the past then
American officials today see only pro
longed, bitter war ahead.
Officials see in a Germany so
crushed that she must, of military
necessity, restore Belgium and north
ern France, release Austria, Turkey
and the Balkans from her grasp, a na
tion beaten to her knees.
For America and th allies this
means bloody sacrifices. It means
the wielding of every resource to its
utmost capacity. The huge appro
priations this congress has been asked
to approve are an indication of the
cost in money. Officials agreed today
that America and the allies will have
all they can. do ..to crush Germany's
ambitions of world military domina
tion and put her back where she was
before she ran rampant and started
the war., Itwas explicitly pointed
out today that President Wilson voiced
only the American viewpoint. It is
hoped that the allies will fully sub
scribe to this declaration of princi
plesf Again TJ. S. Takes Ix-ad.
There has been a constantly grow
ing demand for a clear-cut statement
of war aims. This government had
hoped that such a declaration might
grow out of the sessions of the inter
allied council and supreme war coun
cil meeting in France. Colonel House
and members of the American mis
sion gave the unofficial Russian rep
resentative their support in urging
that a joint statement be made, as
an aid to Russia.
This statement was not forthcom
ing, but in the president's speech of
yesterday America has again stepped
forward and taken the lead.
APPEAL FOR CHARTERS
Field Day for lawyers. Oil and Bank
Boosters at State House.
This is field day for lawyers, oil pro
moters and bank boosters before the
state charter board. More than fifty
men interested in charters and selling
permits from the blue sky department
are attending sessions today in the of
fices of J. T. Botkin, secretary of
state.
One of the heaviest dockets in
months confronted the state board
when today's session was called. One
of the first charter applications ap
proved was that of the Great Plains
Petroleum company of Wichita, a five
million dollar concern which plans to
place a million dollars w.orth of stock
on the market in this state. The new
refining company controls a large out
put and extensive lease rights.
Many of the companies seeking ap
proval today are oil concerns. The
majority of these companies are in the
southern Kansas field. Several pro
posed banks brought their troubles to
Topeka for today's session. Work be
fore the state board may not be clean
ed up until late today or sometime
Thursday.
NEW DRY VOTE SOON
Kitchin Says Permanent Prohibition
l p Before Christmas.
Washington, Dec 5. A vote on per
manent national prohibition and a wo
man suffrage amendment to the na
tional constitution will be taken in the
house of representatives before the
Christmas recess. Majority Leader
Kitchin said today.
"These measures will be taken up
by the house about the twentieth," he
said. "We feel they should be put be
hind us early in the session, to clear
the way for war work."
The suffrage amendment is expect
ed to be reported out of the judiciary
committee Tuesday without recom
mendation. The prohibition bill will
also be placed before the house at the
same time.
MOVIE CASE IN COURT
Producers Would Appeal Direct to
Courts for Review.
Rights of movie producers to ap
peal from the state appeal board di
rect to the courts for review of pic
tures is being contested today in the
supreme court- The case involves the
rejection by the state board of the film
"The Easiest Way," and will deter
mine a 1917 amendment to the state
movie censorship act.
When the film was rejected the
Widwest Photo Play Co. sought to
secure a review of the picture at the
hands of the Wyandotte district court.
The attorney general's office main
tained that an appeal would be taken
to the courts only to show irregular
ity or. malice in rejecting a film. The
producers contended the court should
personally view the picture. In the
trial court a decision was rendered
for the state. An appeal was taken
and the state supreme court will de
termine the procedure in an appeal
from state board. It is probable an
opinion will be handed down in Jan
uary. CAPPER URGES

tainly these are . the ideals toward
which the world yearns. The Amer
ican Bible society would send these
ideals into the trenches with the
American army. It is a purpose which
patriotic, thoughtful citizens should
support.
"The boy goes forth to battle in war
for righteousness and peace. When
you send him to face the enemy and
to meet the perils of war, give him
the word of cheer and courage and
of hope.
"Integrity, courage, loyalty, obedi
ence, purity these are old virtues,
but no army can win without them.
'Righteousness exalteth a nation' and
an army. Trust in God, confidence in
immortality, belief in sacrifice these
are the things which have made
Christian armies the most formidable
In the world. And Kansas can do no
less than to aid in its support of the
morale of our army. An over sub
scription to the fund will do it."

Wall St-, New York. Dec. 5. STOCKS
Prices moved in the enstomsry erratic man
ner during the first hour, strong stocks
reacting while a few backward issues hard
ened. The market continued under the in
fluence of the president's message, however,
general unsettlement developing later. All
gains were lost and leaders touched levels
considerably under yesterdsy's qnotation.
United States Steel fell 2 points to 87 and
other Industrials were equally heavy. Rails
lost 1 to 3 points with specialties. Liber
ty 4's sold at 97.36 to 87.62 and the 3'a
at 98.54 to 98.64.
Stocks were moderately well supported at
the opening of todsy's trading, rallies over
yesterdsy's finsl quotations extending from
large fractions to more than s point in
important issues. United 8tstes Steel gain
ed 14 points and leading rails were sub
stantially better, notably Union Psciflc snd
Reading. Utah Copper and Crucible Steel
also strengthened. Shippings. Sugar and
Tobacco were heavy snd Continental Can
broke 5 points Liberty bonds yielded
lightly.

' v ' Weather Report:
WEATHER FORECAST for Kansas: , .
" Cloudy, unsettled, colder tonight
and Thursday.
The fifteen handred men who are building pipeline extensions to
new gas fields are lodged in thirteen small tent cities scattered
over the work In such a way that each' man eats and sleeps very
near the place he is working. That saves time, and each moment
of every twenty-four hours Is precious in thistremendous construc
tion effort.
As the ditching gang; progresses along the right of way its camp
is moved and the pipe gang takes its place. After the latter, comes
: the gang that fills the ditch after the pipe is laid.
There are seven American camps, three Bulgarian and three
. Mexican. All of the tents are 16x35 feet. Along the two sides of
each are rows of bunks with good mattresses and heavy comforts.
Lanterns light the tents and there are stoves which make them
warm and cozy these cdol autumn evenings.
Thesfeeding of the men in the temporary towns is interesting, but
that must wait until tomorrow. "

New York. Dec. 5. The Financial Bulle
tin: The suggestion of a prolongation of
the war with Its tax burdens, etc, following
the president's message of determination
to win snd recommending of swar deci ra
tion against Austria, has Induced invest
ment llquidstion In prepsrstion therefor
and it may continue temporarily. Humors
a re current that "Austrisn holdings" in the
United States are being thrown upon the
market. More price regulation talk and
delay in railroad relief measure are caus
ing considerable of the selling. The enr
talled short interest sllows market to slide
l off easily. We do not believe the move
' ment will go far at present. Would rather
1' buy on breaks for turos, preferring to
mske ssles on sharp rallies.

I'timent In corn last night wss mixed. None
I of traders were able to see much on bull
:side: neither were they certain of the Dosl-
tlon of the bears being safe enough for the
present to wsrrnnt heavy selling. Some
selling of December snd Janaary by caah
bouses was taken as indicating the making
of No. 4 corn by drying andd s few con
sidered it ss significant. Those who con.

for a rally should there be sny improve
ment in the buying. Many are inclined to
look for narrow market
There are many friends to the bnll side
of oats who think prices are to work irreg
ularly higher until the cash situation Is
materially loosened. Others take the posi
tion that tbey can buy plenty of oats In
country, and that it is only a question
of cars. One csah handler from Indiana
ssys holders there are afraid to sell unless
they get cars, s it Is the only safe wav.
A few traders regarded the short Interest
ss well reduced, and thought the market
in no anspe to stsnd any heavy selling.
Most of the No. 4, 6 and 6 grades of corn
arriving from Iowa are of poor quality and
sell st a discount of about 10 cents per
bushel under Illinois and Missouri grain
of same grades.
Chicago, Dec. 5. Loran and Bryan ssys:
Corn. The strong resistance that the mar
ket has oeen meeting on the bulge, and the
indications that cash values wilt ease quick
ly with any increase In receipts, prompts
the view thst sales on small upturns will
yield good returns.
Oats No doubt the sdvance has ma
terially reduced the short Interest In this
commodity, snd cs export buying is not
likely to be excessive st tnls level, we
believe sales made now can be replaced to
advantage a little later.
