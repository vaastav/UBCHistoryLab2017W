Our neighbor of the Register makes
a tilt at the veracity of the Catholic

Eight years of a whisky-drinking,
tobacco consuming, horse-racing and
Sabbath breaking President. Four
years of a Fraud, and now four years
of a man who sold himself for $329!
That is what this country has been
brought to under Republican rule.
The Republicans undertook to
steal the organization of the State
Board of Equalization, simply be
cause it afforded a little pationage
to be distributed. They didn't quite
succeed, however. The leaders of
the Republican party have cheek
enough to steal from their grand
mqthera.
Mr. Hayes admits in his message
that the colored persuasion were not
bulldozed at the late election. He
might have added, however, that
white laborers of the North were
compelled to vote the Republican
ticket or lose their "bread and but
ter." The color makes the differ
ence.....'. . In his message fr. Hayes speaks
about the dangers of "patronage of
appointments for personal or parti
san considerations." That coming
from a man holding the stolen Pres
idency and who appointed to official
places every scoundrel that assisted
in placing ' him in the position, is
cheeky, to say the least. .
We want our friends to understand
that in public officials using the peo
pie's monc3r in violation of law and
their obligations, we kuow no party.
We have no more 6 mpathy for a

are plaj-ed out. Around here they
might as well subside and allow
those who are honest to run the
machine. ' ;
, Our neighbor of the Register
agrees that the law is against the
Councilmen who took ' pay for ser
vices rendered on public jobs. ; Ol
course it is. Every man with a grain
of common sense knows it, but we
had the "sprig" of a lawyer in Eaton
to argue with us differently the other
day. lie had better go to mauling
rails, than attempting to demolish
plain Statutes of Ohio in that man
ner. ........ .
The cotton factory owners at Fall
River, Mass., hive effectually solved
for themselves the problem of pro
tection. To them protection means
high prices for goods manufactured;
but to their workmen it means star
vation wages for their labor. At
least that is the way it is working
now. There are other examples of
employers ( who promised better
wages to workingmen if Garffcld was
elected; but no sooner was the elec
tion over than the then low wages of
laborers were reduced still lower.
, While it is true that all the south
ern states voted, for Hancock, there
was 1,300,000 more votes cast for
him in the north than in the south,
or in the approximate proportion of
six democratic votes in the north to
two in the south, or to put it differ
ently there are twice as many demo
crats in the north as there are in
the south, while there are three re
publicans in the north to one in the
south.
The grand jury in general session
at New York, presented indictments
against Joseph Hart, Lewis A. Post,
Kenard Philp and Charles A. Bryan,
for publishing in the Truth newspa
per "a criminal libel'' upon General
Garfield. Judge Noah Davis, before
whom Kenard Philp was examined
on the Garfield-Morey Chinese letter,
lays down the laws of libel thus: "If :
a public newspaper charges a man
with being a liar, felon or forger, the
editor is guilty of libel, unless the
charges are true." Under this rul
ing Garfield should commence suit
againt the New York Tribune,
Times and other Republican papers
for what they . said about him in
1873, provided they lied.
The Southern question is treated
at considerable length in the mes
sage of ( Mr. Hayes. He expresses
satisfaction with the affairs in the
Southern States and believes that
the South is steadily advancing in
the direction of political freedom and
toleration, and that before long the
ballot in that section will be as free
as in the North. He also expresses
the belief that the era of bloodshed
on account of political differences
has passed and points to the fact
that there is now less intimidation
and violence in the South than was
practiced a few years ago. The
bloodshed era has been succeeded
by an era of fraud and misrepresen
tation through tissue ballots and
other devices of misrepresenting the
real strength and disposition of the
colored man, but while he is cheated
in this way his physical rights are
beginning to be universally respect
ed., Mr. Hayes might have added
that the party that stole the Presi
dency for him is largely responsible
for ballot box frauds in every part of
country.
: Hon. S. S. Cox has announced
that he will shortly introduce a bill
in Congress for the reapportionment
of Representatives under the new
cer sus. He thinks that the Consti
tution of the United States requires
that such a measure shall be passed
at the earliest practical time after u
decennial enumeration of the popu
lation has been made. As it is
purely a mathematical question so
far as Congress is concerned, Mr.
Cot cannot understand WI13' aliy
body should seek to delay it on par
lisan grounds. He says that if any
partisan advantage is to be gained
by a reapportionment this winter
the Republicans will be benefited,
because they control the Legislatures
in a majority of the States, and will,
therefore, control the re-districting
of those States. Mr. Cox says per
sonally he would prefer to see the
whole number reduced to 250, but
he has no hop-j that this can be done
and is inclined to think that 300 will
be the lowest number tuat can pos
8ilrly be fixed, while the probabilities
are that 325 will be the number
adopted. Mr. Cox says that when
the census figures arc complete they
will show a population somewhat in
excess of ,000,000.
It is amusing to read some of the
labored articles of "smail fry" Re
publican journals, about fiand and
corruption in elections, and .the
weakness exhibited in their effort's
to make it appear that the Demo
cratic party.is Ihcbnly.sinner in this
respect, while the Republicans are
all good, pious and moral Christians !
The Republican party since it has
been in power, has been guilty of
the most shameless debauchery and
corruption in conducting election
campaigns, and in the one just clos
ed, it excelled all its previous efforts.
Ohio and Indiana were carried in the
October election by the sheer use of
money and lawless colonization of
negroes, repeaters and ballot box
stuffers, and the State of iNew York
in the same manner in November.
The vote in Indiana in October
shows an increase of over 30,000
male inhabitants more than the cen
sus takers could find in June last,
and in the counties where the Re
publican vote shows the greatest in
crease this excess is the largest
which ought to be enough to satisfy
any candid mind that it was a sys
tematic Republican game, carefully
planned and skillfully executed" all
over the State. In Ohio it was the
same. We need onlv to refer to the
city of Columbus, which returned
1,000 more votes than the census re
turned male inhabitants of a votable
age. Republican employers every
where were beset by their party
managers and begged and threatened
until they consented, some willingly,
some otherwise, to compel the men
in their employ to vote for Gar
field. From all over the country
we have well authenticated reports
that the workingmen in extensive
manufactories were notified bv those
in authority over them that if they
voted for Hancock they would be
discharged, but if they voted for
Garfield they could rely : upon
steady work with them. And this is
the party that hoTls and whines
about negro intimidation and bull
dozing in the South! ; Such conduct
is worse than the negro Blavery that
prevailed before the late war, and
unless the American laborer will rise
up and resent the insult and vote
their honest sentiments, it will not
be long until his condition will be
far "more degrading than ever was
the enslaved negro.
- .
Gen. Grant, the great national
panper of this country, contributed
his share of. services toward
placing a Frau 1 in the White House
in 1876, but has failed thus far to
receive his reward. Mr. Hayes
speaks for it in his message in the
following passage, which "'at the
same time shows the tendeney of the
Republican party toward a monarch-
ial government: " '
I commend to the attention of
Congress the great services of the
commander and chief of our armies
during the war for the Union, whose
wise, hrm, and patriotic conduct did
so much to bring that momentous
conflict to a close. The legislation
of the United States contains many
precedents tor the recognition of dis
tinguished military merit, authoriz
ing rank and emoluments to be con
ferred for eminent services to the
country. An act of Congress author
lzing the appointment of a Captain
General of the Army, with suitable
provisions relating to compensation,
retirement and other details, would.
in my judgement, be altogether fit
ting and proper, and 011 Id be
warmly approved by the country."
m m m t
It is said of John Randolph, of
Virginia, that on being asked why
the Old Dominion did not prosper
more, he replied: "Why the negroes
raise the corn, the hogs eat the corn,
and the negroes eat the hogs." Now
adays, says a correspondent of the
Washington Post, we have a politi
cal back-action movement, affecting
the Democratic party as this eco
nomic one affected the prospects of
Virginia. The Republicans raised
and control the national banks; the
banks issue the money to buy voters
and the corrupt voters keep the Ee
publican party in power.

The New York Herald says :
During the recent canvass no iour
nals were so stalwart hs the Repub
lican papers 111 Southern Ohio. It
made one s blood tun cold to read of
the horrors that would follow from
the election of Hancock. Since the
election, however, the Southern mer
chants of Louisville and other points
in Kentucky have been complaining
01 the tone ot those Republican pa
pers, and talk about transfcring
their trade to other markets.' We
have discovered that a Republican
may be very stalwart about election
times, but when he has goods to sell
he would just as soou have a Demo
cratic customer as a Republican.
Now these Republican papers take
up a chorus of friendship for the
South, deny that they ever said any
thing .against their ""brethren" and
urge their brethren to come and buy
in Cincinnati and to be as friendly
as it is possible for brethren to be
luis change is a curious one. It
is only another illustration of what
we see every day of the insincerity
of our political life. What the Re
publicans wanted to do before the
election was to elect Gen. Garfield
liierelore thej- howled about the
"miseries of Southern domination."
Now they want to sell goods, and
tliey coo ana chirp in the most af
lectionrte manner about "fraternity
and "union."
It shows the devilish hypocrisy of
the Republican journals, ami proves
that their howls about the South are
only to influence simple minded vot
era. It's about played out, how
ever.
WASHINGTON LETTER.
From our Regular Correspondent.
WASHINGTON, D. C.,
Dec 12, 1880.
Mr. Hayes 13 entitled 'to all the
credit or discredit involved in the re
tiremeat of Generals McDowell and
Ord, and that'of several Bereau Gen
erals soon to be 'anuojjnced. On the
whole, I think he has done just what
the law certainly intends, although
it does not distinctly command it.
Most men, however, will disapprove
of the substitution of Howard, who
is a sentimental General, for SchO
ficld, who is a solid thinker and an
equally good General, as Command-
ant of West Point. There is consul
erable-danger that the Academy will,
under Howard, be an experimental
school for the study and develop
mcnt of negro morality and negro
capacity, rather than, as heretofore,
a school of military education. ,
ihe annual message from the
White House was received by the
Senate and House of Representatives
without manifestations of applause,
In fact, the messages of Mr. Hayes
have ' not attracted much Congres
sional attention for several years
That portion of the present one which
speaks of progress in reform of the
civil service under the present Ad
ministration is so absurd that it
must have inclined members to
laughter, but they suppressed their
feelings while . it was being read
Everybody knows that there . has
been more absenteeism among office
holders during the present Admin
istration than during any other, and
more meddling .with pclitics, and
more contributions for political pur
poses. , .these things were not done
boldly, as . the Jack Shepherds of
Grant's time did them, but slyly, as
JNoan Ulaypole would do them.
Mr. Hayes is able to truthfully say
that the crops would have been good
during nis Admistration, and there
fore he argues the people have been
more prosperous than for 3'ears. He
points to the fact and receipts from
mport duties have been large bnt
does not 883', as he might, that this
indicates an accumulation of wealth
in a few hands as compared with the
great mass of people. I do not think
it unlikely that we shall hav 6tart
ling evidence soon that the-importa
tions are greater than the 'solid in
crease, of wealth will justify. ' ;
Mr.. Hayes also suggests that the
office of Captain-General be created
for ex .President Grant.
The meeting of Congress on Mon-
da37 was. without any event of note.
Ihe two measures which have so far
attracted attention either in Com
mittee or in., the House are the re
funding bill, and the resolution pro
viding a "joint rule" for counting
the electoral vote. This latter-prop
O8itiott which is simply to restore
the conditions of affairs under which
in 1868 aad 1872 the vote was count
ed, was consideraoiy discussed yes
terday in the House. So far as the
speaking was concerned, it was on
the part of Democrats favorable to
an early vote on the the joint rule,
while the Republicans demanded un
limited time for debate. There will
be an early disposit ion of the whole
matter, I think, and I do not see that
either party will gain -anything,-no
matter wnat is done on the subject.
ihe highest interest any one may
suggest for the proposed $100,000,
000 of refunding bonds, is three and
one-half per cent. Secretary Slier
man, of course, is the man who sug:
gested the highest figures. The
House Ways and Means Committee
have agreed on three per cent. Mr.
Kell3 however, thinks two and one-

. The Conutr Commissioners of the
counties of Darke and Preble met at

to consider upon the Engineer s Re
port of the Whitewater Ditch, and
to hear objections of land holders
along the route. After jangling all
day and doing nothing, the- ad

ditch and from there to view it south
to its termination. If there is snow
on the ground as there was on Wed-

trip through the hoby land for all the
knowledge that they will get b
walking along the line of the ditch.
But they will'gt-i im-.ir per diem out

Finger Board for 1881.
Philadelphia Times.
Some years ago a republican Pres
ident and a republican Secretary of
the Treasury decided that Chester
A. Arthur, then Collector of New
York, must be removed' from office
because he persistently prostituted
the public service to favoritism and
profligancy and resisted every effort
of the administration to enforce
economy - and integrity in the New
York custom bouse. " There was no
attempt to' conceal the grounds on
which Collector Arthur was remov
ed. "The President and Secretary of
the' Treasury both stated, in the
most distinct terms",- lo the commit
tee or , the Senate and . to Collector
Arthur- himself, that his removal
was demanded by his flagrant de
bauchery of the public service, and
a Republican Senate accepted the
judgerrent of the President against
the earnest protest of Senator Conk
ling, and continued Arthur s suc
cessor. The affront of the Grant
leader of New York was resented at
Chicago by Coukling petemptorily
demanding the nomination of the
dishonored collector for the Vice
Presidency, and he will take the
President's 'chair of the Senate on
the 4th of March next, and one life
will stand between him and the Pre
sidency of the United States.
Gen. Sharpe, a relative of Grant's
and one of the Conkling school of
Grant restorationists, was also one
of the federal custom house officers
of New York, and was 'displaced by
President Hayes tor the same rea
sons which dismissed Arthur,
Sharpe was sent to the Legislature
by the party and Conkling made him
Speaker of the Honse to emphasize
his contempt for reform within the
party, and to make another unerring
hnger board 01 the Republican reign
01 the luture.
A. B. Cornell was another of the
Grant-Conkling custom house offi
cials who fell beneath the civil ser
vice reform policy of President
Hayes in the earlier and better days
of his administration, and he was re
moved, because, like Arthur, the tes
timony was conclusive that the New
York federal officials under Grant
had degraded the whole public ser
vice at their command to political
corruption and profligacy. Conk
ling avenged that offense by making
the rejected Cornell Governor of the
Empire State, where he now labors
for the Grant restoration and stands
on a conspicuous fingerboard point
ing to 1804.
