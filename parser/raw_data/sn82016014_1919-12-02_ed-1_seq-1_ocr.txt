None of the fears that railroad

by Governor Allen. He told the State

would be moved. Coal produced Mon

the fact that non-union mined coal

question. They could see no reason
for a tie up at Pittsburg.

"We are operating seven strip mines
today and everyone is on his toes."
Governor Allen stated over the tele
phone. "There Is a regular blizzard
here. Strip mines were never before
operated under such weather condi
tions. But my boys are not the quit

get coal and they expect to get it.
A blizzard only drives home to them
the necessity, for more coal for the
sick and the unfortunates who have
had no voice In this dispute."
In view of weather conditions and
the fact that nearly 600 additional
workmen reached the fields on special
trains today, there is little probability
that more than one train will be made

resolutions protesting against "being

non-union labor."
Brotherhood officials assured oper
ating heads of Kansas roads that the
unions would carry out their contracts
In full, when the state and govern
ment plans of operating the mines was
first talked of. the operating officials
asserted. "Fulfillment of contract," it
"was asserted, would mean ythat the
trainmen would handle the coal, and
refusal cf the southern Kansas men to
hnnl it would be an ".outlaw" action,
without sanction of union heads.
If the trainmen in any locality do
not handle the coal, the first action of
the railroads will be to call upon the
brotherhoods to carry out contracts.

HOWAT IS BITTER
Denounces Gov. Allen for Ac
tion Taken in Crisis.
Predicts Action by . Miners
Against Claimed Injustice.
Pittsburg, Dee. 2. Alexander How
at, president of the Kansas miners,
bitterly denounced the action of Gov
ernor Allen in sending workers and
troops into the coal fields to produce
coal, today.
"If the governor sends all the troops
in Kansas down here, it will not
change the attitude of the miners,"
Howat said.
"One thing is certain, he will not
need any soldiers to protect United
Mine Workers(at the mines as there
will not be any of them there."
"The feeling against Allen is bitter,"
Howat said. "He has intensified the
situation. Nothing could have been
done that would have made the miners
more determined."
"In my opinion," Howat said, "the
time is drawing near when the work-
ins class of America will nor fnntimie
j to submit tamely to great injustice."

May Be Haled for Contempt,
State and Federal.
UNIONS TOO FREE WITH TALK?
Howat, Dorchy and Titus Are
Inspiring Opposition.
To Stand No Interference on
Part of Men in Fields.
Alexander Howat and his lieuten
ants may be haled before federal and
state courts for contempt. Such ac
tion was indicated today when reports
were received ' a't the state house to
the effect that special agents are keep
ing the mine' workers union officers
under close watch.
Freedom with which Howat, W. A.
Dorchy and Wilbur. Titus have criti
cized the action of the state and fed
eral government -in their coal strike
action has brought down action from
official sources, it was declared. The
suspicion that the Howat following
has inspired opposition of trainmen
brotherhood members toward the state
coal production program gave strength
to the feeling that arrest of the men is
not improbable.
Bold for Contempt.
Action against Howat and his men
might be taken by either the, state
supreme court or Judge Anderson of
Indianapolis, who is in charge of the
government anti-strike suit. Should
mine worker heads seek to interfere
with the work of the receivers or to
direct opposition to the state program,
they might be held in contempt of
court. In such event the state supreme
court might act on motion of the re
ceivers, the governor or the attorney
general. Interference with the gov
ernment program might bring action
thru the federal court. Judge Ander
son has power to cite men for inter
ference with his orders.
Statements by Howat, Dorchy and
Titus have tended to inspire opposition
to both state and federal plans, state
officials declare.

a good state of preservation, however,
and indications were that it had been
embalmed. Two large sacks of salt
jammed into the trunk also aided In
the preservation.
Doctor Young stated examination of

BOOZE NOT BEVERAGE
-When Is wDrink Sot a Drink?"
Court Most Decide.
Hew York, Dec. i. "When is
.drink not a drink?" Another
conundrum, bred t prohibition,
was sprang In supreme court here
today. '
The answer" is, "When it is taken
at meals for food or ailmentary
purposes at home," hotels and res
taurants." This contention was made' by
counsel"- for Howard Major, of this
city; a stockholder 4n the American
Malt & Grain company, a $13,000,

against erstwhile - directors; com
bating their action in selling out

that the words "beverage purposes"
in the federal prohibition amend

CLOSE BAKERIES AT 5
They Misinterpreted Coal Conservation
Law and Remained Open Too Long.
Under a mistaken idea -of the city
coal conservation ordinance," bakeries
have remained open until 6 p. m. They
were notified today that this applied
only to the manufacturing side of the
business. '
All retail trade, must cease at B
o'clock in the various baKery plants.
There is no reason why they should
remain open after 5 o'clock selling
bread, -cookies or other products also
sold in grocery stores closed by the
ordinance at 5 o'clock, city commis
sioners stated.
It was also decided at the commis
sioners meeting today, to permit shoe
shining parlors to operate under the
hours tbey desire, effective beginning
Thursday. The shine artists want the
same hours as barber shops. They will
be open from 9 a. m. to 6 p. m. week
days except on Saturday, when the
hours will be from 11 a. m. to 8 p. m.
They asked for the change of hours be
cause barber shops operated on that
schedule and most shops had shoe
shfhing stands.

PHONE LINES OUT
Giant Triangle of Trouble in
Eastern Kansas.
Seven Hundred 'FoIes Down in
Topeka Territory.
Fighting ice and bitter cold and the
super-human vandalism of the ele
ments more than 150 men -are out
along the roads of southeast Kansas
today trying to hard to restore a par
alyzed telephone service. The worst
storm in years from the standpoint of
the wire men hit -the lines Saturday
morning. By Sunday night hundreds
of poles and many miles of wire were
down. Today it was estimated that
fully 700 poles are prostrate and in
the' meantime the telephone service
men are out with their pike poles and
pliers trying hard to restore the serv
ice to normal.
The office of Fred MunSon, tofl line'
wire chief at the local office of the
Bell company today, was filled with
the rapid fire of orders issued to the
reporting repair men. Copper wire,
new poles, and the hundred and one
necessities of a big telephone system
in the' making were sent out in a
steady stream to the workers. Every
man in the office was bending all
energies to the -quick repair of the
lines.
Service to Kansas City is complete
ly closed today. The Associated Press
reports which usually come thru Kan
sas City are coming Into Topeka today
via Dallas.'Texas. Nor would Munson
promise any relief on news service
today.. The telephone wires were tem
porarily in order for a little time Mon
day, but went out again during the
night when the ice laden wires
dragged the poles down or broke them
off.
Extra efforts were made by the
United Press today to serve its clients
in getting the text of the president's
message to them In time for publica
tion. Reader of The State Journal
will be interested in knowing that the
text read by -them in this evening's'
paper came - from Washington, thru

Triangle of Trouble.

less in the form of a giant triangle
with Topeka, Kansas .City and Iola.
forming the terminals. Lines north
and west of Topeka are in operation,
but the miles of toll lines in the trian
gle territory are almost completely out
of commission.
Munson asserted today that the serv
ice with Kansas City will probably be
temporarily restored some time ' this
afternoon. But he '"-clared that the
ice fast wires put such weight on the
pojes that the night winds furnish the
last straw and the poles go down.
The wire chief himself was out on
the job all day Monday. He eaid that
in many localities the poles were
broken in three or four places. The
cross-arms are crushed under the
weight of ice and wire, and it is al
most impossible to clear the lines.
Munson said that six and seven men
were required to lift the fallen poles
to their original position, and that even
then their efforts were strained to the
utmost. As a rule four men will lift
a pole into the air without trouble.

Much of Address Devoted to
Nation's Labor Problem.
Congress Urged to Apply Prin
clples of League In Solution.
MUST END OLD ANTAGONISMS
Government Mast Not Play Cap
Hal Against Labor.
Prposes Extensive Program to
Control Cost of Living.
(MESSAGE IN DETAIL ON PAGE )
Washington, Dec '2. President Wil
son today sent to congress a messag
urging an extensive program of re
construction legislation.
His communication was devoted en
tirely to the great problems confront
ing the nation.
Legislation was recommended to
curb Bolshevism, reduce living cost.,
remove the grievances ot labor which
are causing industrial troubles, aid
farmers to produce bigger crops, sim
plify the system of taxation built up
during the war, control government
expenditures by a budget system and
care for the nation's soldiers and
sailors who have left the service.
Tho the president several times
referred to the peace treaty and the
league of nations, he did net discuss
the treaty situation. He will do so
in a later message,- according to re
liable information today. He also will
deal later ith railroad questions, he
Informed the legislators.
- Much of the message was devoted
to discussion of the labor problem.
To solve it. the president said, con
gress "must now help in the difficult
task of finding a method that will
bring about a genuine democratication
of industry based upon the full recog
nition of the right of those who work,
in whatever rank, to participate in
some organic way In every decision
which affects their welfare."
Tho League "Principles.
No better means of doing this can
be found, the president declared, than
by applying in legislation the principles
set trp in the labor section of the
league of nations covenant. To go
back to old standards of labor and
wages is Impossible, he said. Age
long antagonisms between capital and
labor must be ended, he declared, be
fore real world stability can be ac
complished. In this the United fc'tates.
he said, is bid by the world unrest to
"put our own house in order" and "ba
the first to lay the foundation stones"
of industrial peace. The president
warned against anti-strike legislation.
"The right of individuals to strike
Is inviolate," he declared, "and ought
not to be interfered with by any pro
cess of government." But. he added
that the government has the predomi
nant right to protect all the people
against the challenging aggression of
any single class. ,
Analysisof "labor complaint, th
president told congress shows - it is
based upon Justice. Capital, too, het
declared has a right to an adequate re
turn, and the government, he warned,
must never "play" capital nd labor
against each other.
NATIONAL UNREST. Blame for
the unrest in the country was placed,
partly upon the senate for its failuro
to ratify the peace treaty.
One cause of this unrest, the presi
dent asserted, Is "the failure on th
part of our government to arrive
speedily at a Just and permanent
peace -permitting return to normal
conditions."
While congress should deal with th
activities of Reds and agitators, the
president advised against action either
"Impatient or drastic." He urged that
the causes of unrest be sought and re
moved, and outlined them thus: v
"The causes of this unrest while
various and complicated are super
ficial rather than deep-seated. Broadly
they arise from, or are connected with,
the failure on the part of our govern
ment to arrive speedily at a Just and
permanent peace " from the trans
fusion of radical theories from seeth
ing European centers from heart
less profiteering and lastly from
the machinations of malevolent agi
tators." .
"Stronger laws against anarchist
should be enacted at once, he urged.
HIGH COST OF LIVING Th
president appealed again for enact
ment of the comprehensive program
he proposed at the special session to
lower living costs and only one meas
ure of which became law. This pro
gram Includes extension of the Lever
food control act, eloser regulation cj
food distribution snd cold storage, li
censing of all corporations dealing is)
interstate -commerce.
BUDGET SYSTEM Wilson opened
his recommendations with the hop
that a budgel system will be estab
lished, which will put the preparation
of appropriation estimates under di
rection of the president, eliminate th
great duplication in conrress by. rea
son of the number of committees deal
