When President Roosevelt steamed
down to the head of the column of
warships anchored in Hampton Roads
this morning, and ordered a hoisting
signal set on the Mayflower, 10 bat
tleships and four supply ships, a col
umn six miles long, under command
of Rear Admiral Robley . Evans, u;i
anchored and in single file, passed out
the Virginia capes in stately review.
The band on every battleship played
ih "Star Snansded Banner, the sides 1
of the ships were lined with sailors,!
the officers were at attention and the
president stoon wnn neau uncoeieu.
. , 1 1 1
When the last ship in the line passed
the Mayflower, that vessel headed for
"Washington.
Admiral Evans's fleet turned south.
"Where it is really headed for is not
Vnown. The program at present is
that It shall" arrive at San Francisco
about May 1 of next year.
No matter what the real destination
of the fleet may be, the naval import
ance of the movement may be sum
med up in these words of the president
from his recent annual message: "No
fleet of such size has ever made such
a voyage."
The fleet has been designated offi
cially by the President in his message
as the battle fleet. This is not be
cause the fleet is necessarily going to
give battle, but because it is the fleet
that would give battle if this country
were engaged in war with another
maritime power.
It is the first time that any fleet of
the United States has been called a
battle fleet in time of peace. It is a
departure in naval nomenclature that
is significant to many persons. To
those in the navy it ?s regarded as
meaning that this fleet is being made
ready to give battle, and that the set
tled policy of the navy department
hereafter is to have a fleet keyed up
to battle, pitch all the time.
The Ostensible Purpose.
The ostensible purpose, and the only
purpose so far as has been given out
and so far as the naval officers of the
fleet know, of the cruise is for prac
tice. That means the solution of
problems of long continued seaman
ship in concert, of supplying a great
fleet with coal and provisions in out
of the way places and of target shoot
ing. The president has said that the
cruise to the Pacific will show what
the needs of the navy are. It will
bring out the defects in training and
equipment, and the best means of cor
recting them will then be a matter for
the navy department and congress to
deal with. The president has declar
ed that "it will be of very great edu
cational use to all engaged in it." Let
Jt go. therefore, that this cruise is for
educational purposes.

suit.
MUST SHOW IMMIGRANTS.
Chicago, Dec. 10. A stirring, appeal j
in behalf of Jewish emigrants from
Russia was made by Rabbi Emil G.
Hirsch last night before the Men's
club of the Fourth Presbyterian
church.
"You must remember,'' he said,
"that Christmas day in Russia is a
day of fear and trembling for the
Jews. On that day ro Jewish woman
is safe from insult and the men fear
for their lives.
"When they flock over to this coun
try you must expect that they will
carry with them some of their pecu
liarities. The newly arrived immi
grants do not know but that Christ
mas here means the same to them as
in Russia. It is for us to show them
that here is the land of toleration and
freedom."

TOLD STORY TO COAL

The Young Man Will Return to
Ohio Where He Will Once
More Begin Life's Battles
Anew Was Fined.
"William Lutz. a young man twenty
two years of age, with a wife and one
child to .support, stole twenty-fne
cents worth of coal so that they would
not suffer from the cold. This morn
ing in the city court the young man
J pleaded guilty to a charge of petit lar
iceny. It was Lutz's first offense and
.'tne court, and nrosecutor felt sorry
for the young man and he was let off
with a small fine, $." and costs. This '
j fine was paid by Lutz's foster parents,
I who reside at Greenville, O., and they
j will take him and his family back
i home with them so that the young
L !.. -l.'f
man can start me over again m uu
ferent surroundings.
Lutz frankly admitted that he stole
the coal from the Wayne works,
where he had been employed steadily
for the past four years. . He said that
it was the third time he had helped i
himself to fuel belonging to his em
ployers, but that he had never been
caught in the act until last
Friday j
night, when the night watchman at thejstantial in the city and is in splendid
factory saw him leave the foundry
with a bag containing four
or five
large lumps of coal.
Lutz said that he knew that he was
doing wrong when he took the coal, j
but that he had to do it, because he '
had no money with which he could
"Couldn't you buy coal on credit?''
asked Judge Converse.
"No sir, 1 could not. I tried to at
one of the coal companies and they
told me that it was a rule among all
coal dealers in the city not to sell fuel
on credit," replied Lutz
The young man explained that of
late he and his wife and child had suf-
' ffn-pri from illness and that all the
money he could maUe v,ent to pay phy-
yjcians' bills. "I would rather steal
than beg or borrow money," said Lutz.
; The night watchm.n who appeared
"against Lutz informed tne court that
he did nQt Hke tQ tegUfy ugamst the
! young man, but that he was forced 1 1
j do so to stop the practice of stealing

Excessive brooding over religion, on

for Miss Ella Church's being commit
ted to the Easthaven hospital for the
insane at Richmond, Saturday morn
ing. Miss Church, who resides in
West Charles street, Muncie, was once
a Christian missionary in foreign
lands and her mind from childhood
had been engrossed with religion. A
few years ago she was an inmate of
an institution for the demented and
was discharged. The reappearance of
dementia is thought to have been di
rectly due to further deep reflection
on religious topics. Miss Church was
brought to the hospital under the
guardianship of Mrs. Stafford Perdiue.

DECLARED
ON MERCANTILE
INTERESTS OF CITY
Printers in Richmond Claim
That Merchants Patronize
Out of Town Print Shops
And Newspapers.
WON'T ADVISE LABOR TO
TRADE WITH MERCHANTS
Favors Parcels Post, as Labor
Will Profit by Competition
And Open Markets Brought
About by Such System.
The Richmond Typographical Union
No. :ol. has declared war on the mer
chants of this city. This action was
taken Sunday when the union held a
meeting and adopted resolutions favor
ing a parcels post service.
The union charges that the mer
chants of this city have been unfair to
the local newspapers and job printing
establishments by advertising in out-of-town
papers and by having a large
amoumt of job printing done in neigh
boring towns and cities. This policy
on the part of the Richmond mer
chants, the members of the local typo
graphical union contend, deprives the
local printers of much work and keeps
a number out of employment.
Because of this policy of the Rich
mond merchants, the typographical un
ion does not feel under any obligations
to protect home mercantile interests
or to advise the laboring people of
Rictimimil to natroiiize home mer
chants. The resolutions adopted by
the union follow:
Whereas, In advocating the parcels
post, we recognize that it is an invita
tion for more competition in the mer
cantile business, but in doing this we
are only guaranteeing to the laboring
classes that which they must abide by
when they sell their labor In the open
market. If labor must sell its product
in the open market, it should have the
right to profit by unrestricted com
petition in buying. Therefore, be it
Resolved. That Richmond Typo
graphical Union. No. 3t, does not rec
ognize that it owes anything to the
local merchants in the way of home
pride. It hps, on several occasions,
in a courteous and business-like man
ner, requested local merchants to be
consistent in their demand for home
patronage, and to have their printing
done in Richmond by Richmond
printers. This many local merchants
have refused to do: instead they have
taken their printing to towns employ-
ing cheap labor. In fact, Vome of our
lo(al merchants have gone so far as to
obtain bids rrom local printing onices.
and then showed these bids to out-of-town
offices, (who do not spend one
cent of their profits in Richmond.)
wilh tne "'Quest that the lids of Rich-
monu printing nouses oe cut. inis
s
not even tair competition. n
is also
a fact that many of our Richmond
merchants spend more money in ad
vertising in out-of-town newspapers
than they do in Richmond newspaper--,
which fact only deprives the local
printers of that much work, and re
duces the number or printers that
would be employed in Richmond if the
local newspapers and local job print
ing establishments were given the ad
vertising and the job printing that is
sent out of town. And be it further
Resolved. That in view of these
facts, the members of Richmond Typo
graphical Union, No. IJOl. do not feel
under any obligations to protect honvi
merchants or
to advise the laboring
people to patronize home merchants.
Reciprocity is the only antidote for
competition, and this the local mer
chants have failed to extend to Rich-
j mond printing establishments. And,
j be it further
' Resolved. That these resolutions be
read upon the minutes of the union.
and that copies be printed and sent vo

organizations. Richmond Central La

SPOKE TO ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS
SOCIETY, SUNDAY.
B. F. Wissler, at the Annual
Election, Was Chosen Pres
ident of the Organization
Campaign Planned.
The Wayne County Anti-Tuberculo
sis society neid a very interesting
meeting Sunday afternoon in the Sun
day school rooms of the First English
Lutheran church of this city. Dr. D.
W. Dennis of Earlham college, address
ed the meeting in his inimitable style
on the germ theory of diseases, as ad
vocated and demonstrated first by the
celebrated Frenchman. Dr. Fasteur. A
large portion of his address was given.
to an explanation of the methods by
which Dr. Fasteur arrived at his con
clusions that diseases are the results
of the ravages in the human body of
specific forms of microscopic plants
or germs, technically called bacellll or
microbes. Dr. Dennis wove the sev
eral steps of Dr. Taeteur's discoveriea
into a most instructive story whien
laid a good foundation for a campaign
of education, along the lines of pre
vention and cure of tuberculosis.
The speaker then made freo use ol
the stereopticon to show the diversi
fied forms of these destructive litt'e
creatures and how they multiply and
thrive under favorable circumstances,
and how they languish and die under
other conditions. The speaker re
garded Dr. Fasteur as one of the great
est of this world's men. In conclu
sion the speaker developed three well
established facts, namely:
That consumption is a germ disease.
That consumption comes from writn
out and not from inheritance within.
That consumption is preventable.
That consumption Is curable.
After the address the society held Hi
annual election. The officers for tl
