Executives intention to deal with neighboring
boring commonwealths on a footing ofperfect
perfect equality and it i equally clearthat
that our Federal Government has accepted

Although the President does not mention

some misgiving on the part of LatinAmericans
Americans with regard t the extent ofthe
the right of supervision and controlwhich
which we might be disposed to arrogateIt
It was the aim of Mr ROOTS mission todispel
dispel the impression that our interpretation
tation of the Monroe Doctrine carriedwith
with it an assumption of superiority orthe
the assertion of a right t exercise somekind
kind of protectorate over the countriesto
to whose territory thedoctrino appliedNothing
Nothing says Mr ROOSEVELT could bofurther
further from the truth than this impression
sion and he records with satisfactionthe
the belief that Mr RoT has put an endto
to it The President quotes and makeshis
his own the assurance given by theSecretary
Secretary of State to the Rio de JaneiroConference
Conference that we wish for no territoryexcept
except our own and for no sovereigntyexcept
except the sovereignty over ourselvesand
and that we neither claim nor desireany

person such discrimination to b followed

it seemed inexpedient that the Conference
enc at Rio should undertake to makenuch
such a discrimination or put forth sucha
a resolution As most American republics
tics are indebted t European creditorsan

the Rio Conference would look like theassumption

BOHEMIAX FREE THINKERSExplanation
Explanation of the Trouble Between theChurch
Church and It Racial EflemlfsTo
To TUE EDITOR or TUB SUN Sir A reportappeared
appeared In TiE SON of December 4 to theeffect
effect that children In the Bohemian freeschool
school are taught atheism that they are Instructed
structed to believe that thee Is no God andthat
that the text books provided for the littleone
one are filled with that Idea and otherInfidelities
Infidelities Your readers may want to knowsomething
something more about this matter which Iscausing
causing such an uproar In the Bohemiancolony
colony and may want to learn the wholestory
story as It appears to an Impartial and dispassionate
passionate observerAccording
According to the latest statistics at handevery
every BOO persons out of 1000 In Bohemiaare
are nominally Catholics Singularly enoughmore
more than so per cent of the Bohemians whoemigrate
emigrate to the United State secede sooneror
or later from that Church Some of thesecessionists
secessionists join Protestant sects but themajority
majority of them join the ranks of Indlfferentlita
entlita and agnostics Not a few avowatheism
atheism openly So widespread has thamovement
movement become since 1848 when Immigrants
grants of this nationality first began to comehere
here that out of flftytwo newspapers whichthn
the Bohemians maintain In tho United Statesall
all but seven have Joined In the opposition totheir
their former Church In New York city wehave
have two dally newspapers both of whichare
are nonsectarian and one weekly which Ispublished
published by the PresbyteriansThe
The Rev Dr Vincent Plsek has billlt upQuite
Quite a powerful Presbyterian church onEast
East Seventyfourth street mainly from theranks
ranks of the secessionists and his Sundayschool
school Is one of the largest uptown Although
though Dr Plseks school Is a neighbor to theBohemian
Bohemian free school on East Seventythirdstreet
street maintained by the free thinkers therenever
never was any friction between these twoInstitutions
Institutions because Dr Plsek It a broadminded
minded gentleman who Is content to takematters
matters a he finds them The RedemptorIsts
Ists support a parochial school on East Sixtysecond
second street and they too are unmolestedby
by the opposition and Father Mateju of thisthird
third Bohemian school and church ha manyadmirers
admirers even In the hostile campDr
Dr Steiner In hil latest book On the Trailof
of the Immigrant says somewhat sarcastically
tically that the Bohemians In the UnitedSlates
Slates are not A good as they think themselves
selves to b but on the other aide they arenot
not half as bad as other think they are Certainly
tainly one of their tnt traits Is their liberalism
ism and tolerance of belief and you have notread
read In the newspapers for the last twentyyears
years that they had a row anywhere withanybody
anybody over the matter of faith Theybelieve
believe more In evolution than In revolutionbut
but If fight they must they appreciate that Itshould
should b done with ne rspers and booksand
and not with fistsRight
Right here I may say that it Is a mistaketo
to suppose that the Bohemians are backwardIn
In education Statistics gathered In our seaports
ports and reported to the Bureau of Commerce
merce and Labor will bear me out that butPer
2 per cent of those who come here are analphabets
alphabets In this respect they are onlyoutclassed
outclassed by the English and the Scandinavians
navians aqd they lead the German Immigrants
grants who according to the report for 1005show
show 4 per cent of IlliteratesTo
To understand better the causes that leadto
to the secession of which I speak above I Isnecessary
necessary to take a glance a the past of ourpeople
people Prior to loio when the disastrousbattle
battle of White Mountain near Prague tookPlace
Place Bohemia was ninetenths ProtestantProfessor
Professor Glndcly the author of the ThirtyYears
Years War Is the authority for this statement
ment This may seemstrange but It shouldnot
not be forgotten that John Hiis the Bohemiananticipated
anticipated Martin Luther by 10 years withthe
the reformatory movement The victoriousllapsburg
llapsburg Emperor after the battle mentioned
toned took terrible revenge on the Bohemians
lens for rebelling against him and with Oreand
