THE UOVtIUNOR". >lI>SAGI _
—which we print to-day gives a very clear
statement of the condition of tho State,
and the prominent subjects which require
legislation. We commend it iv the main,
and upon the hasty reading which our
limited time permits forbear adverse criti
cism upon doubtful points. Education is
appropriately put in the foreground, and
very ably handled. The equalization of taxes
prison reforms, immigration, public im
provements and constitutional amendments
are made the subjects of just and en
lightened reasoning.
We should have been glad of a pointed
and emphatic recommendation for a General
Railroad law, and in behalf of some other
progressive measures to bring Virginia
into line with the other great States of the
Union. As it is, we are glad to commend
the general tone of the message, and to ex
press tho hope that its many wise and
excellent suggestions may be heeded, its
omissions supplied and its errors avoided
by the Legislature.
We call attention to the very able letter
of Colonel Hughes, which will be
found in another part of our paper.
While we subscribe entirely to the spirit
of the letter, aud commend it as a timely
expression of the popular sentiment in Vir
ginia, in all that relates to the material
interest and welfare of our people, wo can
not regard ono of its concluding utterances
as the true sentiment of the Republican
party in the State. Wo refer (o what
the Colonel sa,)B -bout repu linting the
Stotc debt. If a State debt could be paid
by a rhetorical flouri.sh, so easily turned ofl'
as the facile pen of our esteemed friend is
at all times capable of turning it, we should
not hesitate to assume any responsibility
witbin the limits of becoming indebtedness.
But we have demonstrated, over and over
again, that the Funding bill of 1871 wab
inevitable repudiation to the State, if its
provisions were carried out ss tho framers
of the law designed. Had our warnings
not been heeded in respect to that law,
there would not havo been a dollar in the
treasury to-day to meet tho contingent and
other expenses of the Legislature.
We detest repudiation as much as any
other man can, and consequently the
rood that leads to it is what we would
most avoid. A fair and equitable adjust
ment of the State debt, with no compound
interest swindle to saddle additional mil
lions upon the people, is what wo want,
and what the people of the State will
have before they surrenders the mselve3 in
to the financial hands of Wa.l-street.
SCIENTIFIC LECTtfr-ES -OP SCHOO S.
While some public-spirited citizensof Rich
mond ore endeavoring to secure scientific in
. -tructon for the children in the schools we aro
glad to see that a similar work is being prose
cuted in Philadelphia with success. Col
onel Forney thus speaks of the effort
tbare:
"It was one of the special delights and
duties of the great Faraday to give scien
tific lectures for the young. This he did,
as he so pleasantly boasts, for "nineteen
years." There have been too few found
to continue his happy service for science
and popular education. Dr. Tyndall ap
peals to the older classes with his eraud
demonstrations, but he has not taken up .
the work of his great predecessor for the
childrsn. We wero delighted auditors for
sod spectators at the recent scientific mati
nees which were connected with the Cen
tennial Course of Lecturers at tho Academy
of Music, and given by Professor Richards,
•f Massachusetts. He has won the reputa
tion of being a most fascinating lecturer on
his great themes. But, while we do not
dispute his great merit on the evening plat
form and before the " brilliant audience
of evening lecture-goers," we think his
work before the children is something
extraordinary in interest and value.
There ho has no peer, and, if anything
could add special excello ico to the system
of public instruction in our city, it would
bo to have Professor Richards lecture fre
quently, if not at regular intervals, before
the advanced classes in our best schools.
Indeed, he would teach more ph losophy to
our boys and girls in three lectures than
they oould get from books in threo months.
»t occurs to us to ask why such an invalu
able adjunct to our public instruction
could not be male a part of our city school
education. Professor Richards has the
enthusiasm and much of the facility and
skill of his great predecessor, Faraday, and
will, we hope, be largely honored and re
warded in his public work for the advance
ment of science, both among our boys and
girls and with "children of a larger growth"
bo less.
—Several months ago, a little boy
named Segar became interested in the chil
dren of the Howard Mission, and deter
mined to do what he could for them. It is
not much, apparent!v, a boy seven years
can accomplish in this direction, but he
went to work with a will, saved the pen
nies given him, run errands, and picked up
bits of iron and sold them. On Saturday
he opened his treasure-box, and found
therein two dollars and eighty-three cents,
with which he bought a broken-1 ick pis
tol, and has twenty-eight cents left. So
much for perseverance.— Danbury Newt.
The occupants of a room over the study
of Professor James Hadly, of Yale College,
who died last Thursday, were onco inter
rupted, while boxing and rolling dumb
bells over the floor, oy a gentle tap at the
door. After the customary "Come in,"
the door was slowly opened by the old Pro
fessor, who said, with a smile, in his pecu
liar halting way, "Young gentlemen, I
would be pleased to see you in my room
at any time, but I would rather have you
come in through the door than the ceil

—Here is an anecdote from Mr. field's
"Yesterdays with Authors," too good to

LOCAL, MATTERS.
The First Lecture op Professor
IIOWLAND.—A large and intelligent aud
ience assembled at Virginia Hall last even
ing at the opening of tho Scientific Lecture
Course. Professor Uowland proceeded to
explain the character of tho instrument
used in the lectures. Tho composition of
various gases was illustrated by somo
beautiful and striking experiments. Oxy
ygen and hydrogon gases were mixed
and exploded with a loud report in bubble*
of soap suds and in tho hydrogen pistol.
The Professor remarked, for tho benefit of
the boys who play with soap bubbles, that
they could improve their quality by using
good white castilo soap and a little glycerine
added. They can thus make thetu strong
enough to float a longdistance. Hydrogen
was then burnt in tubes of various sizes
producing musical tones of great power and
sweetness.
The calcium light was produced by burn
ing oxygen and hydrogen gases on a ball
of lime. This is generally known ns the
Drummond light. The construction of the
electrical battery was explained, and the
mode of generating the electricity and ap
plying it to produce the light. The battery
consists of eighty cups of vulcanized rub
ber, zinc, porous cups and platinum, and
is charged with diluted sulphuric acid and
concentrated nitric acid. The extremities
of the battery are connected with the lamp
by insulated wires. The electricity is thus
made to pass between two charcoal points
and produces an intense light at tho point of
contact. The intensity of this light is about
seventy tunes greater than tho calcium
light. Tho unprotected eye cannot bear it
without danger, and by its aid tho most
wonderful results have been achieved m
microscopic investigation. The light was
then produced aud the striking shadow of
tho carbon points of tho lamp was the first
object thrown upon the screen and ex
plained.
Tho Professor then exhibited a great va
riety of objects, showing the wondrous
power of the instrument. Lines ruled at
the rate of 114,000 to tho inch were re
solved in the field of this powerful lamp so
as to be counted. Minute animalculse
ware magnified ono million five hundred
thousand times. The flea, the louso, the
itch mite (-'Acorn* Scabie"), the chee.-io
mite, the sugar mite, the vinegar eel, tho
" trichina spiralis'" of the pork eaters, and
hundreds of other animals were shown
enlarged to ten feet iv length. A series of
microscopic viows of the structure of mus
cular tissue made by Dr. Woodward of
the anatomical museum in Washington,
were very finely shown and were of treat
interest to the medical profession. Some
splendid photographs taken by the new
carbon process were superior to anything
we have ever seen, and excited great ap
plause.
The views of the Yellowstone, by Prof, j
Hayden, U. S. Geologist, wore strikingly i
beautiful, and publicly ejhibited for the
first time in this country.
The lecture closed with somo very fine
experiments with the monster magnet
which Prof. Howland has suspended on the
platform, and which holds up 2,000 pounds.
Three men suspended their weight upon
the armature. A pail of nails were thrown
against it by the handful and stuck till
the connection of the magnet was
severed with tho battery, when they fell
instantly to the ground. The entiro audi
ence expressed their delight and satisfaction
with the exhibition, which was as solid and
useful as it was entertaining. The next
lecture of tho courso is on Thursday even
ing, and we trust will be fully attended, as
it deserves to be.
From a Barrel to a Wash-tub.—
Ihe revenue laws must be rigidly enforced
m the Sixth district. In ono of the pretty
little towns, not long since, the revenue of
ficer s wife was left in charge of tho office
for some days, and e*ery one knew that
she was as fully at honi3 at tho head of the
office, er two or three of them, as at the
head of her kitchen.
.A. fire broke out in the office of the Ex
culpator, and a barrel of whisky was
placed id fearful danger. Men worked
bravely to save it, and even got it in a place
of safety, when they discovered that the
rough usage given it by loving hands had
strained the barrel and the precious liquor
was fast wasting its sweetness on the pave
ment. Little Mrs. Bird had just seated
herself to tea when a message came that
half a dozen men were in the office and de
sired to see her immediately. So she went
down and found them clamorous for per
mission to change the package! Now Mrs.
Bird is a temperance woman as well as a
revenue officer, and one also with a fine ap
preciation of the ludicrous. She asked the
owner for a statement of tho facts, and
perhaps required the necessary affidavits,
and then gave permission to put tho whis
ky in a wash-tub. They left with aston
ishing abruptness as soon as tho permission
was obtained, but there was a great deal of
sorrow that night for lost liquor.

GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE, j
Commonwealth of Vibqlma..
Executive Chambers, I
Richmond, Dec. 4, 1872. J
Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Delegats, •
During the year now drawing to a close
the people of this Commonwealth have
been blessed with peace, good order, a
thorough administration of and obedience
to law, and a reasonable* deirrco of nros
perity. '
The prevalence of a severe drought over
the Northern half of tho State seriously
damaged some of" the crops, while almost
universally throughout Southern and South
west \ irginia the crops were superior to
any there grown since the war.
The condition of the people has generally
improved, and a better and moro hopeful
spirit prevails. It cannot be disguised
however, that their future well being as
well as that of the Commonwealth, is
largely dependent upon your action during
your present session. We have escaped
many perils duriug the post seven and a
ha r years, but others environ us, which
will require great wisdom, caution, and
comprehensive statesmanship to avoid. A
firm and courageous adhesion to the plain
and fundamental principles of right under
all circumstances, regardless of selfish or
demagogic appeals or denunciations, will
conduce to the correct and conscientious
discharge of every duty.
I bespeak for tho varied and important
interests of tho Commonwealth your care
ful, deliberate and conscientious considera
tion and action, assuring you of my hearty
co-operation In any and all just measures,
haying for their object the promotion of the
public weal and the development and ad
vancement of tho State.
EDUCATION.
_ The cause of education in our State dur
ing tho past year has met with the most
gratifying success. The number of our
common schools has increased to over thir
ty-six hundred, and tho attendance of pu
pils to over ono hundred and sixty-six
thousand, and there has been a marked
improvement in tho excellence of the
schools. This is strong evidence of the in
creased perfection of our school system,
and the growing interest and desire of the
people for education. The system, how
ever, is not yet perfect, nor is public senti
ment in its behalf as far advanced as is de
sirable ; but tho success of the past is the
sure harbinger of "better things to come."
We may confidently hope that the day is
not far distant when the opportu
nities for free education will bo af
forded every child in the Common
wealth. Our common schools are the source
from which our colleges and higher institu
tions of learning must draw their chief sup
port • and these again will contribute to
the University the larger number or its
students. Wo have in proportion lo popu
lation a larger number of colleges than any
State of the Union, and their superior ex
cellence is attested by tho fact that they aro
all prosperous. Our University stands in
the front rank of the literary institutions of
the country. It is a University in fact
as well as in name. Founded upon * the
true theory of a University- a school in
which all branches of learning are taught
—it has kept abreast of the advancement
of the age, and to-day affords facilities for
the acquisition of sound learning, equal to,
if not greater, than any institution of tho
country. Tho recent addition of a school
of Agriculture and Industrial Chemistry
supplies a growing want, and will largely '
conduce to its usefulness and prosperity. ''
It is a State institution, founded, owned '•
and controlled by tho State; all tho people
of which ever have, and I trust ever will,
oherish a just pride in its well-earned and
well sustained reputation. I commend the '
report of its Board of Visitors to the care
ful consideration of the members of the !
General Assembly. '
The report of the Board of Visitors of ■
the Virginia Military Institute, another ]
State institution, makes a most satisfactory
exhibit of its condition and prospects. The ]
rapid recuperation of this institution from !
its almost total annihilotion during the late
war has been remarkable, thus affording '
the highest evidence of able management
and established reputation and popularity.
Since your last session another State ed
ucational institution—the Virginia Agricul
tural and Mechanical College—has been
fully organized and put in operation, with
an able corps of officers and professors and
a fair attendance of students.
On tho Ist of May last the Board of
Education (the Kector of the Virginia
Agricultural and Mccbonical College and
the President of the Hampton Normal and
Agricultural Institute being present and i
assenting thereto) sold tho land scrip
donated by act of Congress at the price of |
ninety-five cents por acre, which lam in- i
formed was a higher price than any State I
had obtained for its land scrip at that date. |
The terms of sale required a cash payment I
at date of sale, and the balance in three i
instalments, at two, four and eight months,
all of which have been made except the i
last, which falls due on the Ist proximo.
From the sum total of $285,000 realized
from this sale, $19,000 has been set i
aside by the request of the Board of Visi
tors ol the Virginia Agricultural and
Mechanical College to be used in the
purchose of a farm for that institution, aud
the balance, as received, has been and is
being invested in the bonds of this State,
$300,000 having already been purchased.
I trust that the General Assembly will
promptly place this investment upon the
same footing as like investments of the
other educational institutions in the State.
The Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical
College is almost wholly dependent for its
support upon the interest accruing upon
this investment, and unless that interest be
promptly paid much embarrassment will
ensue, and sooner or later its doors will
have to be closed. While originally doubt
ing the wisdom of organizing an indepen
dent college for the purpose of realizing the
benefits of this trust fund, now that that
course has been adopted, I am extremely
anxious to have the experiment prove a
complete success and to have this nstitution
amply and satisfactorily fulfill the special
purposes of its organization. It should
constantly be borne in mind, however, by
all, that the proceeds derived from tlie ssfe
of the congressional land scrip constitute a
special fund for special purposes, and that
the State is the trustee of that fund ohorged
with the duty of administering the trust ac
cording to its prescribed terms and condi
tiona. The Hampton Normal and Agri
cultural Institute is doing most efficient
service in the cause of education, and that
portion of the interest accruing upou the
land scrip fund set apart for the use and
benefit of this institution I have no doubt
wl ilS_? e J udiciou,il y and properly expended.
This brief review of the character and
condition of our schools, colleges, and
University clearly demonstrates an impor
tant fact, and that is, that V irginia posses
{*M educational advantages equalled
•y few and excelled by none of
w sister States. And these advan-

oping and 1 entertain the confident hope
that Vnyinia will yet become the ereat ed

her facilities of communication, as well ea

all contribute to this desirable result. Al
ready our higher institutions of learning
are frequented by students from more thai
two-thirds of the States of the Union, and
tho time is not far distant when our Uni
versity, if fostered and sustained as it de
serves to be, will reckon among its matri
culatcsthe graduates of every college in tho
United States. The work of educating and
elevating the people should be the highest
and most patrio ,ie aspiration of the Chris
tian and the statesman. Universal suf

fundamental principle of our government.

desirable, 13 beyond the pale of reasonable
probability. With this indubitable fact
staringnsm the face, our duty become,
plain and unquestioned. If, as has been
said, and I believe truly, that "the safety
of tne Republic depends utxm tho virtue
and intelligence of the people," that virtue
should be elevated, and that intelligence
increased by every aud all lawful and le
gitimate means and influences at our com
mand. "That country is best governed
which is least governed." and "that gov
ernment 13 tho best, which is best adminis
tered," are political maxims the practical
realization of which can only be attained
through the education and consequent men
tal and moral elevation of ths people.
CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS.
Tho act of March 19,1872, providing for
the submission to the people, at the election
in May last, of n proposed amendment to
the Constitution of Virginia in relation to
the clause in respect to and entitled
Usury," has been fully executed. Tlie
amendment was adopted, and a proc
lamation by the Governor making known
tho result, as required by the fifth section
of said set, was duly issued, a copy of
which is herewith submitted. The adop
tion of this amendment strikes from th?
Constitution the inhibition contained in the
last clause of tho tenth article of tho Con
stitution, and remits tho whole subject of
tho rate of interest upon money t> the con
trol of the Legislature. The little interes'
felt by the people in this subject was evi
denced by tho fact that less than one
fourth of them voted upon the r.uhj.ct and
that of a total poll of 00,402 votes, 20,320
were against the adoption of the amendment
Iwo other amendments to the Constitu
tion were recommended in my last annual
message, and events which have transpired,
not only add force to the reasons then
urged for such action, but suggest others of
equal or greater cogency.
Tho shameless pollution (if the ballot
which has recently been witnessed in some
of our sister States forces unon us the grave
consideration whether the very foundations
of our social and civil fabric are uot being
sapped by corruption, and whether the bs I
lot, instead of being the palladium of our
liberties, is not becoming the instrument of
their destruction. Certainly every guard
and protection should bo employed" to pre,
nerve and maintain the purity of elections
and the free, untrammeled expression o'*
popular sentiment. The imposition of an
annual tax of two dollars upon every citi
zen of the Commonwealth of twenty-ou.
years of age and upwards, to bo devoted
exclusively to th. support and maintenance
of our common schools, and prohibiting
any ono from voting until he exhibits a
proper certificate of the payment of thi?
tax, would not only very rratcrially lessen
the burthen of taxation upon property, but
would also throw an additional nafeguard
around the ballot-box.
An amendment providing fi>r the elec
tion of al! our State officers in May
instead of November, I still urge ujion
your attention, and for the reasons stated
111 my last annual message.
That our fundamental law requires mod
ification and improvement in these and
some other particulars, our experience ha*
fully demonstrated; but whether this can
not be accomplished without the interven
tion of a.Convention as promptly, and with
far lesH expense, is a subject of great grav
ity and imnoi tance, and should receive tli?
most deliberate and profound considera
tion.
FINANCES.
I have heretofore laid before the General
Assembly my views upon tho subject o!
our public debt, and the proper financial
policy to be pursued, so fully, that I deem
it unnecessary to repeat them again here.
Some of these views have been partially
sanctioned by legislative action, but none of
them fully. They all constituted a general
plan or policy, each part of which was es
sential to the completeness and success of
the whole. The failure to adopt all, to
gether with the modification of some, and
tho repeal of others in part adopted, and
the substitution of something else in
their stead, hai so mutilated and
distorted Ihe original plan as to
reader it hardly recognizable, and in
volved the whole subject in confusion and
difficulty, from which it will require both
wisdom and courage to extricate it. Taxa
tion and finance, at nil times difficult and
delicate subjects to ileal with, come before
you at this time under embarrassments and
complications more numerous and trouble
some than ev.r. To deal with these sub
jects wisely and well they must be grasped
in their entirety, aud broad and comprehen
sive measures adopted and adhered to. A
shifting, uncertain, tcmpoiizing policy, al
ways and under almost all circumstanc.»
baneful and demoralizing, when applied to
subjects of such overshadowing importance
as these, inflict injuries fully commensurate
with the importance of the subjects involv
ed. What we need ii a wise, comprehen
sive, just and permanent policy upon these
subjtcts, and without it coitfusion, distress
ana dishonor will be the inevitable result. 1
trust that you will approach the considera
tion of these important subjects with a
calm, dispassionate,but determined purpose
to so far as possible, equitably and properly
adjust our system of taxation, restore tiw
tarnished credit of the State, and place it
once more upon a sound and healthy basis.
The reports of the Treasurer, the First
and Second Auditors, nnd the Commission
ers of the Sinking 1 und, exhibit in detail
the operations of their several departments
during the List fiscal year, and the condi
tion of the treasury and the public debt at
its close on the 30th day of September
last.
1 desire, in passing, to cail the attention
of the General Assembly to one or two
items contained in the very lucid report of
the Second Auditor, for the purpose of
dispelling some misapprehension which
seems to have prevailed as to tho total
amount of the public debt. First, our
public debt lia_ not been increased one
aellar since 1861, except from the accre
tions of interest, which we have not been
able to pay. Second, the total old debt
