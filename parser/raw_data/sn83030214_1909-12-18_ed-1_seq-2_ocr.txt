to It. as they were accustomed tr> d" to the
other big sugar refineries about New York,
a charge of something more than 4 cents
a 100 pounds for lighterage. The railroads
contended that the Federal company's re
finery In Yonkcrs was without the zone
within which the railroads undertook to do
the lightering of sugar to the railroad ter
nun;i The tnpany, on the other hand,
protested that its refinery was much nearer
to the terminals than some of the re
fineries within tlie znne. but failed to ob
tain refunds on supar shipments, when It
undertook to do tts own lightering. An
appeal was taken to the Interstate Com
merce Commission, which <lis«grr-ed on the
question, but the matter is still before that
body for adjudication.
Gtaua A. Bpreeksia, the head of the com-,
p&ny, is now in .the West, but it was said
at the offlcea of the company yesterday
that every facility had been afforded the
government toward conducting rii investi
gation. In his absence it was said that the
company did not -ye It owed the gov
ernment atiy money for short weighing of
nugar importations, as nothing had been
heard directly since the government in
vestigators had completed their work of
checking tip the' books, Officials who were
s<-f-n. however, made it plain that if short
ages were found it would be a great sur
prise to them. If there were any shertages.
they were mire the Federal company waa
not responsible for them.
Meanwhile, the American Supar Reflninjr
Company is making every effort to repair
the bad impression that it is confessed has
been created by the revelations already
ma<!e in the puirar Investigation. The In
dictment of Ernest Berbracht, former su
perintendent of the cempany*B Havemeyer
& Elder plant, wtth the significant state
ments made yrFterday by Mr. Stimson,
counsel for the government, that men
higher up were etna aimed at by the in
vestigators, has left an uneasy feeling.
Since James M. Beck took liolii as gen
eral counsel for the company there have
been long discussions between him and of
ficials of the company. The intimation that
the government has something v] its
sleeve, and that it will shortly make a
claim for a refund of more thiin $1,030,000
from the company, besides the $2,135,000 it
has already paid in, has helped to crystal
lize the sentiment in the directorate that
those who were prominent in the old regime
of the company must get out.
After a long conference with Mr. Pe<-k
yesterday Washington B. Thomas, the
president of the company, who is said to
have met strenuous opposition in his fight
for a thorough house cleaning, gave out a
statement In which he said that John E.
rs^iiiH had retired as general counsel of
the company- as long aeo as last May. The
announcement, it is i-aid, was dictated In
deference to the feelings of Mr. Parsons,
who didn't relish the impression that he
\\;i> forced out and superseded by Mr.
Beck. Since Mr. Parsons'a withdraw;ii. his
law firm— Parsons, ("lesson & Mcllvalne—
was state has been acting as counsel
pending the selection of his successor.
The statement mat Mr. Parsons had not
been the government's counsel since May
last is taken to be only the precursor of
an early announcement that he has com
pletely severed his connection with the
compar.y In which he and the late Henry
O. Havemeyer were so long the dominant
figures.
MAY INDICT MORE.
Indications of Further Action
in Grand Jury Room Activity.
It was reported last evening that indict
ments had been found against employes of
Arbuckle Brothers, who recently paid into
the Un f ted States Treasury nearly $700,000.
The grand jury in the Federal Build-tig
was sitting all day yesterday, and there
was a steady stream of witnesses in and
out of the room in which the silting was
held, on the fourth floor. The special coun
sel "for the government — at least, those not
in the court •where the six former em
ployes of the American Bugar Reining;
Company were being tried— were examining
these witnesses.
When one of the counsel was asked
whether • mbers of the firm we're likely
to be indicted, he said that the beginning,
as in the other case, would have to be
made at the bottom. Mr. Stimson. in bis
summing up in the. case in court, had said
that no one about to build a house would
b<-Rin with the ridgepole.
The grand jury has not finished its con
sideration of the case of the American
Sugar Refining Company. Other indict
mf-nt.s would be found, it was said yester
day, arnj these uould be of men as high
up as could be desired. None since the in
dictment of Ernest Gerbracht had been
lound, it was said, but this did not mean
that action would not be taken at an early
date, as indicated.
Mr. Gerbracht, it was said last evening,
liad refused to cancel his contract with
Arbuckle Bros., which was ror five years,
at a salary of $30,000 a year. He had re
ceived J2O.00& a year while with the Ameri
can company. When he left that concern
he made the contract with the Arhuckle?,
hut when the latter earned of the proceed
ings to be taken against him by the gov
ernment an offer ■ Hi- made to cancel it.
Then- was a. report yesterday that the
government was ponsible for the attempt
i>> cancel th<? contract, and that it had re
fused to accept settlement of the Arbuckle
case unless; it remained frte from connec
tion with formi American company em
ployes. George M. Mackellar, one of the
counsel for Gerbracht, denied st( rday
that the contract hail lieen cancelled. From
another source it was learned that A r buckle
I.ros. had refused to consider th<- agree
ment any further, and that iracht
would s(ek to have it enforced.
Gerbracht was indicted in Brooklyn soon
after the government began its investiga
tion of the American Sugar Refining Jom-
pany, but Clarence Lexow. Mr. Mackellar's
partner, harl the indictment dismissed on
the ground of failure to prosecute.
Mr. Stimson made an explanation of the
effort to keep the indictment of brachi
a secret. He said (hat the grand jury had
found the Indictment on Friday of last
week, as told exclusively in the Tribune,
und that lie had been arraigned before.
United States Commissioner Hitchcock at
the latter's office, No. 76 William street.
The .secrecy was due to a special request
made by his counsel, L«exow. Mackellar A:
Wells, who said tiiat publicity might influ
ence the jury in its consideration of the
ra.se of the .six former employes of the
American Su^ar Refining Company.
Gerbracht will be arraigned on Monday
for a preliminary hearing. In the trial
■jHrms F. Bendernagel, former cashier for
the American company and one of the de
fendants, when on the wand said that the

left with him for final disposition.
One of tlio Witnesses In the first week of
the trial was William 11. Tears, employed
on the Wllliamsburg Aoeks of the Have
meyer & Elder plant. Tears was asked to
identify stgnaturea of tba checkers in the
pink books which figured as evidence of the
manipulation or the scales. He refused to
do fo. He was recalled the second day
and then made the identification. It was
learned yesterday thnt he had been dis
nisaed from tbc employ of tba company
soon afterward. When seen last nlghi
Tears paid that his discharge waa due to
retrenchment of expenses on the part of
the new Havemeyer & IClder gement.
COLLECTOR LOEB AT TREASURY
Says There Arc No Developments
in Custom House Here.
Washington, Dec 17. — "I have no news
to tell you," said OollectOl l.oeb. of New-
York, who spent the day in Washington.
"There is absolutely nothing sensational
in my visit, and I cannot talk about the
proceedings touching the sugar Investiga
tions now tinder way In New York."
Mr. Loeb said he was looking for th«
arrival almost nny rlav of the first of the
automatic scales Which It is proposed to
place on the docks at New York for weigh
ing sugar. This will bs thoroughly test
ed, and if found satisfactory twenty will

MEfER J^ A FIGHT
LINE AM) STAFF WAM
BREAKS OUT AGAIN.
Reorganization Plan Bitterly
Opposed by Constructors —
Turmoil in Department.
IFmm The Tribune Bureau]
Washington. Dec. 17.— The line and
staff wranglo in th^ fiiivy has hrokpn
out with renewed violence and in a way
which has directed a \igorous campaifim |
against the naval constructors, who he-
J'eye th«y are marked for extinction by
the mersrinß of the menibers of that
corps with the line. Naval officers are |
secretly seeking ro checknmte Secretary ,\
Meyer'* plans by influencinc; members J
of Congress, and there arc all the ele
ments of a highly sensational contest
The naval constructors believe that Mr. j
Meyer's plan of reorganization ignores j
tnem, that it subordinates them in all j
ways and in every place to the line, and
especially to those line offlcen who are
or who will be under the Bureau of
Bteam Engineering. The Meyer reorgan- I
[station, as now fully set forth to the ;
House Naval Committee, will, they say. j
make the naval constructor little better I
than a draftsman.. They say the con- j
strui is deprived of all responsibility ,
and will have little to do except draw j
the pay to which he is entitled by law.
The discussion now troine on In the j
Naval Committee as to the wisdom of j
making certain i bansec in the bill which !
will carry out in a legal way the plan
approved by Mr. Meyer is. of course, par- J
taking of the divergent views enter
tained in the department and the ser- I
vice. That conunittee is not entirely
satisfied aa to the economii al advant
of the Meyer system. There are .some
members who still prefer the New «rry ;
system, of Which they heard most fa- |
vorably from its author in the hearings
a year ago. and for which they have
acquired a likinc from observation of its j
application at the navy yards at Mare j
Island, California and Bremerton, "Wash.,
which were visited by some of the mem
bers last Bummer.
The committee is practically unani- ]
mous in favor of abolishing th< Bureauvj
of uipment and the distribution of its
duties to other bureaus. Opposition to :
legislation which will give legal endur- j
ance and stability and authority to the i
four aids— those for personnel, material,
operai and napectioi — which have j
been appointed by Mr. Meyer for his j
guidance and counsel seems to be in- I
creasing. That looks to them too much j
like a general staff, or the beginning of |
such a body, to which Congress is un- ;
alterably opposed and to such a degree
that if the question ame squarely before
either the House or Senate the General
Staff of the army would to-day be wiped
out of existence.
WANT REPORTS OF BOARDS.
In the mean time the House Naval
Committee is seeking some additional
information from Mr. Mever, on whom
it has called for the recommendations
made by the various boards which have
been convened at different times to ■ oa
sider navy reorsaniza I Reports from
these boards, especially those known as
the Leutze. the Sperr> nnd the Swift
boards, have been regarded as confiden
tial at the Navy Department, and no
one has been able to obtain the recom
mendations from those sources of advice.
The Naval Committee feels that it is
entitled to share with the Secretary of
the Navy the information he gained in
this way, while it is expected that the
publli ation of the repoi will reveal
some interesting conditions, chiefly, the
staff officers insist, the exclusion of their
branches of the service.
The system of secrecy and suppression
has doubtless added to the turmoil
within the Navy Department and
aroused the suspicions of Congress. Mr.
Meyer has prohibited the bureau chiefs
and other officers from discussing in
public, and especially with Representa
tives and Senators, the subject of the re
organization. The bureau chiefs who re
cently appeared before the House Naval
Committee were obliged to ask to be ex
cused from expressing any views or im
parting any information on certain sub
jects which Secretary Meyer had de
clared "confidential." It is Bvei pos
sible that this nforced silence may de
feat the Meyer plan of oization.
In all this the naval constructors be
lieve they see a purpose to extinguish
their corps. A scheme to that end has.
in fa<-t. been under consideration, and
has been put into written form with the
idea of presenting it to Congress as a
draft of desirable legislation It is pro
posed to amalgamate the naval con
structors with the line, ls was done in
the case of the members of the old engi
neer corps. This would require the naval
constructors, who have been Bpecially
trained— some of them in foreign tech
nical schools — for their duties, to take
up navigation and other line or fighting
personnel work and prepare themselves
for duties on shipboard. It may be that
a few experts would be retained for the
work of designing, but the majority of
the seventy-five officers of the corps, ac
cording to the scheme, are destined to
go into the line.

Talk of ( Ira! A mcrican Con

Washington, Dec. 17.— rians are afoot, it
is believed, for a confederation of the Cen
tral American republics. Proof of this is
offered to the minds of the Central Ameri
can diplomats hero n the sudden disap
pearance of Dr. l.vis Anderson, who ius

tilth Benor Creel, the •peclal envoy of

Central American diplomats fear there
may l.t- a conflagration where now there
is only a blaze. Jn such case the govt-cn
rnenta most Interested might interfere, with
the result Unt chaos would onsue and a
new organization would !>»• necessary all
around.
It is believed thai l>r. Anderson hurried
south in anticipation of such Bfl emer
gency. He has the Indorsement of Mexico^
and holds the confidence of at least two
Central American states, if alT;iirß should
reach a crisis demanding consolidation! he
would be on the ground and ready to step
into the broach.
Priendai of Dr. Anderson insist that he
hus gone lo Central America merely to Ml
tend a meeting or the International Society
on Sanitation and to visit his family. This,
others declare, is a clever blind. They
maintain that Dr! Anderson's plans were
"'" changed until it was irned that
Zelaya's abdication was inevitable. Then
followed lh« hurried Interview with Senor
CreH tind the Journey.
The Mexican Boyerninent is committed to

Überately and studiously shying at the sub

over sikli a consolidation. It would mean
that Mexico could exercise far greater
