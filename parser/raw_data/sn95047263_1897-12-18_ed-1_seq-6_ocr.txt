Dont Worry
Nt long before his death General
Neal Dow who was nearly 07 year
old WAS asked the secret of his long
life He said It was that he had never
worried
Similar remarks have been made by
other men who reached an advanced
and happy old ago
In this explanation there Is the es
sence of philosophy There Is no doubt
that worry drives many men and per
haps more women to premature
graves It Is Impossible however for
some persons not to worry They are
BOconstituted that the slightest trou
ble or even inconvenience makes
them miserable They fret over Imag
inary Ills as well as real ones The
habit grows and its wearing effect
becomes worse constantly until the
physical frame weakens and breaks
under it
But the habit of worrying like any
other habit can be resisted with more
or lest success The battle against it
h should begin early in life it should
be part of the self educatlon of every
w individual Natural tendencies can
often bo checked and in many cases
entirely overcome
r We have all seen persons who have
y exceptional reasons for worrying and
yet were the gentlest and sweetest tem
t pered of our acquaintances These
Illustrations of selfconquest should be
inspiring to us all Most of us are apt
to look for trouble When things are
L going reasonably well with us we wor
y ry because they are no better When
there is no real trouble in sight we Im
agine that there Is plenty of it Just be
r yond the reach of our vision and make
ourselves unhappy without cause
c It has been said that we suffer more
from dread of troubles that never
come than from any actual experience
Old General Dow has given us a
1 valuable hint and If we use it rightly
it will conduce to our comfort and hap
piness and to our prospects of long

Against Officials Progress Loan Com
pany of Macon Ga
A very sensational amendment to
the original bill asking for a receiver
for the Progress Loan and Improve
ment company was filed at Macon Ga
Monday afternoon in the United States
court and was allowed by Judge

ers not being satisfied with the appa
rent condition their securities in

make an inspection of the books but
that their request was peremptorily
refused but that after persuation
Messrs Gordon and Burke agreed to
the naming of an expert for the pur
pose of valuing the assets The mi
nority stockholders employed Mr T
0 Chestney to make the examination
But the amendment says that the
only data submitted to Mr Ohestney
were a ledger and memorandum cash
book commencing under date of May
1 1897 that he valued from the bal
ance on the ledger and cash book and
from theirsohedule of notes and deeds
exhibited

and Burke were at that time conceal
ling the books showing the true condi

The London Daily Telegraph commenting
President Me
menting editorially on
Kinloys mesfngo Monday morning
saysIt has been Americas proud boast
Judging
that she had no foreign policy
the
message
from the presidents
ing the
free from
new world is no more
burdens of diplomatic negotiations
than the old
In a document of pretentious
length mostly intended for Spanish
consumption President McKinley de
vise a spacious pretext for gaining
time
Tho Daily Mail says it is uery sat
isfactory that President McKinley
comes out so strong against the jin
goes The DAily Chronicle describes the
message as weak and colorless It
The presidents comments on
says child
the currency issue are positively
like in their simplicity It is safe to
prophesy that his treatment of tins
Cuban question will be received with
a storm Tho annexation of Cuba
would be a deplorable mistake but
the reasons for refraining from that
course are not the milk and water ones
Mr McKinley advances
The Times says Its tone of pat
ronizing tolerance will make the mes
sage not wholly agreeable to Spain
Probably the president calculates that
if he can satisfy the jingoes for a time
with eloquent denunciations and warn
ings ho will find it easier to pursue a
modeate policy
The Standard Bays If Mr McKin
ley represents anything so far it is the
new tariff which is confessedly a pal
pable failure The whole currency
plan hangs upon the condition of an
exchequer surplus but when will that
happy day arrive
Tho Daily News says tho message is
characterized by a desire to displease
nobody

his mite this t Interesting subject by mak
upon experiments upon two
series of
ing a
of normal digestive abilities
persons stomachs ot these two persona
The emptied a few hours after meals
were which had been followed by
sleep some and of others not and the contents
analyzed
The normal stomach acts upon Its
them about and
by churning
rontents this manner subjecting every parti
In fluids
of the digestive
cle to the action
Investigator
The abovo mentioned
found as the result of his experiment
that the constant effect of sleep is to
weaken the churning movements of
the stomach while the acid quality of
the digestive juices Is at the same time
Increased
On the other band he foundwhat
Is quite as interesting that simple re
pose In a horizontal position stimu
lated the motions of the stomach with
out Increasing the acidity of Its juices
The conclusion reached by this ex
perimenter was that while a recumbent
position after eating Is not to be re
garded as harmful one should be cau
tious about sleeping directly after a
meal Especially should this caution
bo observed In cases where there is an
overacldlty of the dlgstive fluids
When all Is said however the above
experiment proves little more than
that in such matters each person Is a
law unto himself that the afterdinner
nap differs In no respect from other
habits which can be Indulged In with
Impunity by some while they work
havoc with the health and happiness
of others Rest after eating Is cer
tainly beneficial both from a rational
and a physiological standpoint
Whether sleep can be advantageously
Indulged In Is a question that must be
determined by the Individual himself
by careful experiment
