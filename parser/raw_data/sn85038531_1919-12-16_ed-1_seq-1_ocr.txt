No Light Thrown on Alleged
Leak in Supreme Court
Wiishinprton, Dec. 16, Department of
justice officials continued today their
investigation ot reports of alleged
"leaks" on supreme court decisions
which were being used as tips for stock
speculation. A minor ollicial of the de
partment and an attache of the supreme
court were implicated In the charges
but Capt. Burke, chief of the bureau of
investigation of the justice department
declared so far no basis for the charges
had been discovered. In a verbal state
ment last night, f'apt. Burke said I
"Mr. B. K. -Moses," with offices in the
Munsev buildimr. Washinitton. had been
reported by Alarlin-l'ew, manager of
the International News Service, for an
alleged attempt to secure flnaneinl
Iwcking from a friend of 1'cw to play
Hie stock market on advance Informa
tion of supreme court decisions.
"Moses told l'ew's friend." Capt.
Burke said, "that he had been doing
tliis for some time but he did not have
sufficient funds to make the profit he
might make if he had financial back
inn." Moses was interrogated by Wm
Flynn. director of the bureau of In
vestigation of the department of jus-
tioe, Capt. Burke said, and denied ne
was rettinir his information from a
nunor official of the department of
Justice as was claimed or thst the lat
ter was getting it in turn from a minor
attache of the supreme court. Moses,
according to Burke, said he had made
his deductions on the future movements
of stocks as any lawyer might have
done from the general information on
cases affecting them. He denied also
tlrt-rc was a fak in the supreme court.
Captain Burke said the official In
nni. v( ion holds a minor position in the
department of justice and that he
denies he knew any one In the supreme
court who would Kive out any informa
tion or that he had been in any such
dcstlH as were charired.
"The attache of the supreme court
denies also that he line any conne'-tjon
with the affair and there is nothing to
show that he did." Capr. Burke aitoco.
However, he said, the investigation
will le continued.

Capt. Leigh will explain tonight

tening devices.
In speaking of the future develop

creased in order to protect It.
Capt. Leigh pointed out thnt all of
the latest battleships are being
equipped with small seaplanes. These
he says, will p'ay an important part
in the future of the navy. They are
being used for scouting duty..
In speaking of the dreadnought
Tennessee," Capt. Leigh pointed out
that this new battleship is equipped
with an engine that is run entirely
by electricity instead of stcain. Tie
said further that the secretary of the)
navy wants the penple of Tennessee
to feel thnt It is their ship and that
they have an interest in her. She
will leave the New York navy yards

JERSEY LIQUOR
DEALERS APPEAL
For. Permission to Institute
Proceedings Against Pro
hibition Law.
Washington, Peci 1.--A, P.)
Permission to institute original pro
ceedings to hae the national prohi
bition amendment declared unconsti
tutional and New Jersey anfl federal
authorities enjoined from enforcing tt
was asked of the supreme (Court to
day by the Retail Liquor Dealers' As
sociation of New Jersey. 4 .
The only argument for the repeal
waa made by Representative Rainey,
who urged a "wet" period flntll Jan.
16, when the constitutional , "dry"
amendment becomes elteotiwe, so that
people of small means might lay in
a stock for medicinal use" and the
government might get $500000,000 In
revenue taxes. , '' . .
"Since the supreme court has de
cided the wartime act is constitu
tional, we must submit td the Inevi
table," said Mr. Kainey, 'butmen 0f
weaitn nave laid In stocks, to:-.-run
them for years, and thou' of less
means snoula . nave some oppor
tunity." , . i
This was the first question as to
the validity of the constitutional
amendment to - reach the jiuprerae
court. George Wki TuckeT. of.;ifc
York," presented4 '-'her motion together
with a printed brief prepared by the
association, ano the court will an
nounce later whether permission to
institute a suit -will be granted. The
association's brief alleged that the
constitutional amendment was an in
terference with the state police pow
ers, a violation ot the fifth constitu
tional amendment, which prohibits
the taking of private property' with
out Just compensation, that neither
congress nor the state legislatures
had authority to propose or ratify the
amendment, and that the amendment,
when passed by the house, did not re
ceive the support of two-thirds of
the membership, as the constitution
provides, but only of two-thirds of
the members present.
Deeply Troubled Over
Fate of Their Business
Louisville. Ky Dec. 16. Kentucky
distillers and former saloon proprie
tors today apparently were deeply
troubled as a result of the decision
of the federal supreme court yester
day, upholding the wartime prohi
bition act. How to lawfully dispose
of approximately 3,000,000 gallons of
liquor worth at wholesale approxi
mately $400,000,000, was a big ques
tion with them. While exportation Is
allowed until national prohibition
becomes effective Jan. 16, 1920, a
scarcity of ocean tonnage prevents
exportation of all Kentucky whisky
by that time, it was said. Distillers
here professed to Bee no chance of

American Ranchman Says He
Has "No Reason to
Complain." '
Eagle Puss, Tex.. Dec. 16 (I. N. S.)
Fred G. Hugo, American ranchman,
captured in the raid by Villlsta sol
diers on Muzquls last Wednesday,
arrived here today after being held
captlvo by the followers of Pnncho
Villa for severe! days.
Hugo declared he suffered no hard
ships during the time he wns held
prisoner by the followers of the Mex
ican bandit chief, and added that he
"had no reason to complain" of the
manner in which ho was treated.
"I wits treated like one of tho
party," Hugo declared today, "and
became really favorably impressed
with Villa." Hugo regarded his ex
perience rather lightly. While hav
ing a five days growth of beard re
moved in a local barber shop he told
inquisitive friends of his experience.
"Yes, Villa was at tho head of the
raiding expedition. He was boss htm-
seir, Hugo said.
"I wns asleep In the ranch house
near Muzqulz when some one roused
me by shaking me. Not too gently,
either. I opened my eyes and found
myself staring into a gun. One of
my ranch hands hod showed the fel
lows to my room. They hnd rounded
him up on the outside and holding
a gun at him had compelled him to
bring them to my room."
Hugo was somewhat reticent about
what happened from then on to the
time of his release, explaining that
he was released upon giving his
promise he would not tell where he
was taken or under what conditions
he had been liberated. Pressed for
further details as to "what happened"
Hugo smiled. "Rather not tell now,"
he said.
Speaking of the bnndlt leader,
Pancho Villa, Hugo said:
"1 had snvral chats with him dur
ing my period of captivity. During
one of these talks he told me he does
not believe in a military government
His hope is to establish a civil gov
ernment in Mexico.
"While he has practically no edu
cation Villa is a man of good com
mon sense. Ho carries on operations
ot his army in a thorough, systematic
manner,-and keeps-his men u.ider

all property in a special book he has

mendations from Director-General
Hines ns to the return of the rail
roads to private control are before
President. Wilson. Neither Mr. Hines
nor While House ollicials will say

whether they udvocale a departure
from the president's announced pur
pose to return tho roads by Jan. 1.
Nor hns there been nny indication
ns to when the president will Issue
a proclamation surrendering the
roads, or announce a change in his
plans.
Some administration officials be
lieve the fate of railroad legislation
in congress will bo a determining
factor in whatever Is done, some of
ficials think It would be disastrous
industrially to surrender the roads
to begin competitive operation again
under Increased costs without an
adequate inciease in rates or some
guarantee from the government.
Meanwhllo preparations are going
forward at the railroad administra
tion to turn the roads back in ac
cordance with the decision announced
by President Wilson in his message
to congress Inst May.
Surrender of the roads would make
little difference in nctmil operation,
as they are now being run by their

licans they did not consider;
themselves in any way bound by"

to be decided by the senate. )
