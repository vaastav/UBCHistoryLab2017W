WESTERN BEEF IN
EASTERN MARKETS
Western beef is coming into its own
N »t over a decade ago eastern buyers
purchased range-bred steers only
when they were unable to fill their
feed pens from other sources, and
usually offered a. much Irwer price f• r
this class of stock than they were
•vil'.ng to pay for that sec-ired from
<»4her places.
experience has taught these buyers
how* ver. that western range-bred

fct?lth. They have a splen hi frame on

Western steer only demands that he be
given plenty of good fresh water and
sufficient feed so that he may never
be hungry and he will always'give a
good account of himself and return
man) dollars in profits to the feeder
when he is sold for the block in the
;.l ring.
These steers shed early under fav
orable conditions, and when they have
reached the stockyards they show an
exterior finish that other cattle, lack
ing the same health and ruggedness,
fail to show. This makes the western
steers ready sellers on the market, and
after they have been butchered the
percentage of the weight of the dressed
carcass over that of other steers under
tlie same conditions is so perceptible
as to immediately attract the atten
tion of those keen, far-sighted men
who handle the yard end of the busi
ness.
The settlement of the west is rap
idly reducing the amount of available
range and is forcing the cattle to go
higher and higher into the hills in
search of forage. This Is greatly in
creasing the importance of freely uti
lising the ranges within the National
forests, and every endeabor is being

DELAY OF LAW
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.—T0 guard
against "the law's delay" and other
inequ.ilities in trials and appeals is
the object of the recommendations of
i
a special committee appointed last
March by the New York Bar associa- j
(ion. The report has been completed
and the association will take it up for
consideration today. President Taft j
has announced himself as in sympa

procedure.
Tin- committee makes these recom

Criminal Procedure:
When two or more defendants are
jointly indicted for felony they should
be tried jointly or separately, in the
discretion of the court. Several trials
of joint indictments in felony cases
•raste t great deal of time. They now
nre often insisted upon to enable a
principal felon to get the prosecution's
evidence in a trial of the joint indict
ment against his tool, thus enabling
the principal to frame up a defense
or giving him time to intimidate or
cajole the prosecution's witnesses.
Receptions to rulings upon the ex
amination of jurors should be abol

the defendant in doing an act is mate

MESOPOTAMIA IS
TO BE RECLAIMED
LONDON. Dec. 14. —A meeting of the
Royal Geographical society was called
today to take up for further considera
tion t'»e remarkable plans of Sir W.
Willeocks for the reclamation of Meso
potamia. British scientists, at first
credulous of the gigantic srheme to
make the Tigris-Euphrates district*
'hi 4 i im as the rose," are now almost
coavi *ed that the plans are feasib'e,
and that the scenes of ancient history
witl again become populous and pro
ductive.
In announcing the project. Sir Win
cocks stated that, bavin? been on
gaged by the new Turkish govern
ment ti survey the rivers and car.a.--
of the Tigri . Euphrates delta and dc
vise projects for the rehabilitation c
the Country, he had set t> work t
.master the ancient irrigation systems
He had already submitted a scheme for
carrying- off the excess waters of tin
Euphrates down the depressions of tbe
ancient Pison. An expenditure of
made by the forest service to open
hitherto inaccessible ranges by the
construction of trails and bridges,
and unused arid ranges by the de
velopment of water. In these higher
elevations the grass is usually much
finer in quality and more nutritious,
while the climate is much more rigor
ous; both of which conditions result
in the animals being in better health
and having mose solid flesh when
placed on the feeder markets in the
fall. This fall has seen large num
bers of the range-bred steers, most of
which come from ranges within Na
tional forests, top] »ing the feeder mar
kets at all points where feeder steers
are sold.
So great has become the demand
for cattle of the quality mentioned
that hundreds of stockmen through
out the west are selling their buncnes
<>f stock cattle and are beginning to
handle steers exclusively. On the old
ranges where a few years ago one
was accustomed to see large herds of
cows and calves. you will find today
equally large bunches made up en
tirely of steers, some of which may
perhaps have come from Old Mexico,
some from Texas, while Arizona and
New Mexico, usualely furnish their
Uiota. These steers are brought into
these western ranges at from 18
months to 2-years-old. They become
acclimated the first year, while in the
second and third years they become
sufficiently mature so that they may
be taken to market.
The demand for cattle of this kind
is greater than the supply, and as In
all other cases wmere the demand is
greater than the supply the price re
ceivd on sale must constantly increase.
That this is true of the steer business
one can easily ascertain through con
versation with any one of the western
stock fen who make this a business.
They will tell you that they have made
more money in the last two or three
years in handling steers than they
made in ten years in handling strictly
?tock cattle.
the act in question should be admissi
ble.
The following changes in the rules
of practice are recommended:
They should be amended so as to
require the written or typewritten
case on appeal to be made and settled
within thirty days after the entry of
judgment, the testimony in the case to
be the stenographer s minutes in ques
tion and answer, after any errors have
been corrected, and arguments, pad
ding and irrevelent matter stricken out
by consent, or if the parties do not
agree, by the 4rial justice upon settle
ment. The paraphrasing of questions
and answers into narrative conglom
erate tends to raise a film of miscon
ception between the appellate court
and the exact truth of the matter.
The local special term calendar
rules should be amended so as to re
quire affidavits on motions where
there is a serious question of fact, to
be exchanged in advance of the argu
ment of the motion, and to require
the original motion papers to be filed
as in the surrogate's court, to put the
motion upon the calendar.
On the judiciary law the committee
says: "Many men of large forensic
experience believe that the law should
be so amended as to give the conven
tion of justices assigned to the ap
pellate division power to make gen
eral and local rules of practice cover
ing all pure matters of practice in the
trial courts."
£350,000 would suffice for the work,
and it would take three years to carry
it cut. The cultivated area would be
doubled and the yield of wheat trebled
along the Euphrates the day th»s work
was completed. The project had been
approved by the Turkish government
and the necessary funds had been as
signed for beginning it immediately.
A project was a so in hand for a great
central canal cf the delta, which would
irrigate 3.000.000 acres of the best
'and in Mesopotamia. This land would
be capable of producing 1.000,000 tons
of wheat and 2,000,000 cwt. of cotton
annually, and to get this produce to
market a cheap railway connecting
Baghdad with the Mediterranean was
necessary. The railway would
be the highway for the merchandise of
Persia, and would be the shortest pos
sible route between east and west.

HOTEL MEN USE
CHEAP MEATS
DENVER, Dec. 14.—1t has become
known that the hotel, keepers of the
west, following their annual meeting
here last week, have decided upon a
plan to use cheaper cuts of meat.
Economy is, of course, the principal
object, but the hotel men defend their
proposed action by the statement that
such meats are really more palatable
and nutritious than the more expen
sive cuts. Whether guests will look
upon the matter in this light remains
to be found out.
According to a local hotel manager,
one of the hardest and most expensive
problems With which a hotelkeeper
has to contend, is the putting to use of
the cheaper cuts of meat, such as the
shoulder and neck.
"The American public demands only
SECURITIES ARE
NOT DISTURBED
(By Henry Clews).
NEW YORK, Dec. 14.—(Special)—
Neither the president's message nor
the opening of congress created any
disturbance in the security markets.
On the contrary President Taft's views
were in many respects received With
special satisfaction. The emphasis
which he placed upon the necessity of
public economy, moderation in regard
to the use of the maximum tariff and
his rational attitude regarding rail
road and corporation problems show
his determination to carry out neces
sary reform movements with as little
disturbance to business as possible.
This is naturally reassuring. Congress
as yet shows no signs of breaking out
with antagonistic legislation, although
it is quite apparent that the radicals
were disappointed at the conservative
tenor of President Taft* message. Po
litically speaking, the situation is
hopeful, for while it is evident that
large corporations must prepare them
selves for more or less government
regulation, and enforcement of the
Sherman anti-trust law in its present
drastic form may cause some disquiet,
still the outlook in these directions is
less threatening than during the some
times unwisely aggressive policy of the
previous administration.
As the year draws to a clove the
stock market finds itself in a more
hopeful condition. It is undeniable
that a strikingly optimistic spirit pre
vails, based upon exceptional business
activity in the United, States and aid
ed by decided improvement of indus
trial and political affairs abroad. The
favorable conditions are many, the
chief drawback being that the busi
ness of the country and values gener
ally are already upon such a high lev
el as to prevent the return of complete
confidence. It is quite evident that
the country is passing through a per
iou of inflation, the causes of which
cannot here be discussed, but which
are a very positive element in the sit
uation. The most unsatisfactory fea
ture is that values are not upon a
stable basis, having fully discounted
all favorable conditions. Investors are
consequently shy and discriminating.
The - better class of railroad securities
are already upon a prohibitive level,
and made more so by the firm rates
now demanded for money.
Our railroad situation is not with
out serious perplexities. Traffic is '
heavy and earnings show correspond- j
ing improvement, but expenses have
grown seriously, and net results are |
very often unequal to those of two j
years ago. That the companies should ;
have to face a demand for higher ■
wages at this time is unfortunate, for ;
they have scarcely more than recov- j
ered from the effects of the panic.
Wages wee not educed at, that per
iod and labor suffered little from the
disaster. It is true that the cost of
living has risen. So too have wages; |
and many of the railroads, if obliged
to concede to latest demands, will have
no other alternative than advancing
the rates and compelling shippers to
pay the bills. The latter will as usual
pass on the increase in expenses to
the consumer. For reasons such as
these railroad stocks and bonds hay?
been comparatively neglected by bcth
investors and speculators, and the
large owners of these properties are
still finding it difficult to distribute
their surplus holdings. Attention is
eonsequent'y being turned to the bet
ter closs of industrials, especially pre
ferred issues which have not been ad
vanced to such an extent as railroad
issues and which are benefiting by
trade activity quite as much as the
railroads. Hitherto this section of the
market has generally been upon a
lower plane than the railroads; but
as many of the concerns become sea
soned and prove their steady earning
capacity the effect is to raise the
standing of such issues, • especially |
while the railroad section stands so 1
the finest cut of meats," he declared,
"while they would receive much more
nourishment and save money by pur
chasing the cheaper cuts.
"The people in Europe make palat
able dishes out of meats that an Amer
ican would not buy. Wte hope to be
able to educate our chefs and our
housewives to make proper use of
these despised meats, and thing that
once the value of them is known they
will be used where the higher priced
meats are now used."
It is proposed that a special series
of instructions be prepared for the
benefit of the chefs, at which the use
of the cheaper meats in the prepara
tion of stews, beef a la modes, and
other dishes where the meat is not
seen will be explained and taught.
much in danger of reaction.
January disbursements will prob
ably show a larger increase than usual,
and it remains to be seen whether the
usual rise at this season based upon
investment purchases will take place
in January or not. It is we'd known
that several important new capital is
sues have been delayed owing to tbe
unfavorable conditions just referred to,
and an unusual number of offerings
will projbably be soon forthcoming.
Thus far this year it is estimated that
new security issues will aggregate
over a billion and a half dollars. A
portion of these issues were utilized
for refunding purposes and did not
re-present new capital; but the actual
issues were very heavy considering
the absorbing power of the market. It
should be noted that recent authoriza
tions have been exceptionally large,
suggesting that considerable applica
tions for new capital are in prospect.
Owing to this custom of securing au
thorization to issue bonds or stock in
advance of actual requirements, the
actual output of new securities is not
always easy to ascertain. It is known,
however, that some of our large indus
trial concerns have recently quietly
sold considerable amounts of bonds
previously authorized. Another feat
ure worth noting is the large amount

schemes, although this form of in
vestment is more popular in the west
than here.
The local money market continues
firm, and bank reserves are low. With
in a month, however, funds will be re
turning more freely from the west. The
bank surplus should soon rise, and
somewhat easier rates of money will
then be probable. The European
monetary situation is improving both
in Paris and London, where the tone
in financial circles is decidedly more
cheerful. The tendency in money there
is towards further ease, which should
make it less necessary for Europe to
settle its balances in South America
and Canada by shipping gold from New
York. Our foreign trade has not yet
settled back into normal conditions.
Imports continue heavy, and exports,
i though increasing, are relatively light.
UNCLE SAM AS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 14. — Uncle
Sam's annual Christmas bargain sale
is the talk of the national capital to
day, among those to whom the word
"bargain" has an alluring sound. Its
official title is the "Sale of Articles
Accumulated in the Division of Dead
Letters," and it is held annually
about two weeks before Christmas
and continues for a week cr more.
Day and evening sales are held, and
the bidding is always lively.
Although this unique sale takes
place at the national capital, the pur
chasers are by no means limited to
persons residing or visiting at the
seat of government. The post office
department issues thousands of cata
logues of its novel sacrifice sale, and
these are mailed to all parts of the
United States upon request. So many
out-of-town residents desire to bid
for the articles put up for sale that
there has of late years developed a
distinct field of activity in Washington
fjr "brokers" Hvho act on behalf of
absent clients in bidding on designated
articles as per the instructions sent
them.
It is a woeful commentary on the
proportion of our citizens who evi
dently do not know how to take the
first step to trace articles lost in the
mails that this annual postal sale
contains thousands upon thousands
of articles. There are upward of
1,000 different "lots." In a few in
stances a "lot" consists of a single
article, but as a rule each item com-
This is readily explained by trade ac
tivity and high prices over here, which
naturally stimulates imports and dis
courages exports.
There is nothing in the general sit
uation to warrant further pessimism
On the contrary the outlook for the
coming year upon the whole is a dis
tinctly cheerful one. There are per
plexities to be faced and the stock
market- is too high to warrant any
special enthusiasm upon the long side.
Ide funds, however, are accumulating
and must seek employment. We sug
gest the use of much discrimination
in making purchases, calling atten
tion to the fact that the better class of
preferred Industrials are likely to
come into greater favor, owing to the
high level of railroad shares, and the
difficulty of finding desirable bonds
at reasonable prices.
AN AUCTIONEER
prises from six to twelve separate
articles, which are thus grouped be
cause of similarity of character or for
some other reason. Many of the un
claimed arUo'es are of Such small
value, individually, that the thought
might suggest itself that the losers
had not considered it worth while to
trace them, but, on the other hand,
there are hundreds of really valuable
articles, including numbers of dia
mond rings, gold and silver watches
and other pieces of jewe'ry.
Then, too, it is a genuine bargain
sale. Uncle Sam has no "reserve
price," and he never bids" in " an ar
ticle. The articles are sold in regular
order, numerically, as they are listed
in the catalogue, and each lot in turn
is knocked down to the highest bid
der without reserve and without re
gard to how inadequate the price may
be as compared with the real value of
the article.
The terms are strictly cash. Uncle
Sam usually derives gross receipts in
excess of $10,000 from this sale,
which, deducting for the cost of cata
logues and other expenses, means at
least $8,000 net profit. This is turned
over to the United States treasury.
However, if at any time within three
years a person shall prove that any
article disposed of at the sa'e was his
property when lost in the mails the
government will restore to that in
dividual the sum derived at the sale
from the disposition of his property.
Because of this responsibility it is
