and in order to avert a panic annouced
to the congregation that there was no
danger whatever, at the same time re
q lesting several members of the con
gregation to assist in putting out the
fire. He then went ahead and reached

sacristy were at work putting out the
fire. His coolness averted what might
have been a serious panic. Loss $75 00.
Raleigh News and Observer: The
reports of the conference show that the
past year has been marked by some
progress along all lines, though the
statements made by the pastors from
the country charges were to the effect
that the people are suffering from the
hard times. Not a few preachers came
to conference with unpaid salaries, and
there was loss to the mission fund and
other causes due to what one preacher
called these 'stringent calamitous
times." Indeed, on Friday and 8atur
day, there was a mournful monotony,
in the reports from the circuit preach
era, '''salaries behind ; collections not
up in full;" by men, too, who had
labored in the heat and cold upon
small salaries.

A CRAZY HEN.
The San Francisco Examiner tells an
interesting story regarding a hen
owned by a Mr. Landgraff, a resident
of that city. It reminds that there are
eccentric hens as well as eccentric men
and women.
Some weeks ago, says The Examiner
as it appears, the hen a fierce and
quarrelsome body left the roost pro
vided for her and her associates, and
took up her quarters among the
branches of a willow in her master's
back yafd. There she soon began get
ting together materials for a nest,
which nest, she built securely in the
crotch of two branches.
After a proper time had elapsed,
the family, in the meantime, having
observed her strange macceavres with
much interest, Mr. Landgraff's man
climbed into the tree in a temporary
absence of the hen.
There in the nest were about a dozen
chickens. While the man was looking
at them the mother returned, and, as
the Examiner says, 4 'made things in
teresting" for him. In fact she flaw
about his head so industriously tat in
his hurried retreat he toppled over the
step ladder and came to the ground
with painful suddennefs
At fast advices the mother hen was
still feeding her chicks in the nest,
while the family and neighbors were
waiting to see how she would contrive
to get them to the ground when such a
proceeding became necessary.

INTERNATIONAL BIMETALLISM
NOT PROGRESSING.
Revision of the Currency Talks on
Tariff and Finance and Foreign Affairs.
Wash ngton, Dec. 6. President Mc
Kinley to day,sent his annual message
to Congress congratulating it upon re
assembling under felicitous conditions,
calling for grateful acknowledgement
to a beneficent Providence which ha3
so signally blessed and prospered this
nation. Peace and good will with all
the nations of the earth continue un
broken, he says. He also, expresses
genuine satisfaction at the growing
spirit of fraternal regard and the unifi
cation of all sections of our country,
upon the universal spirit of patriotism
and the lifting otgreat public questions
above party prejudice and sectional
differences.
Contrary to the usual custom which
has led to the treatment of matters of
foreign relations in the beginning of
the message. President McKinley de
voted his attention first to the financial
question, of which he says:
"The extra session of this Congress,
which closed during July last, enacted
important legislation, and while its full
effect has not yet been realized, what
it baa already accomplished assures us
of its timeliness and wisdom. To test
its permanent value further time will
be required, and the people, satisfied
with its operation and results thus far,
are in no mind to withhold from it a
fair trial.
FINANCIAL OPERATIONS SINCE '66 RE
CALLED.
'Tariff legislation having been set
tled by the extra session of Congress,
the question next pressing for consid
eration Is that of thecurrency. The
work of putting our finances upon a
sound basis, difficult as it may seem,
will appear easier when we"recall the
financial operations of the government
since 1866 On the 30th day of June of
that year we had outstanding demand
liabilities in the sum of $728 868,447 71.
On the 1st of January, 1879; these lia
bilities had been reduced to $443 .889,
495 88. Of our interest bearing obliga
tions, the figures are even more strik
ing. Oa July 1, 1866, the principal of
the interest bearing debt of the govern
msnt was $2 332,331,208 On the 1st
day of July, 1893, this sum had been
reduced to $585,037 160, or an aggregate
reduction of $1,747,294 108. The inter
est bearing debt of the United States on
the 1st day of December, 1897, was
$847,365,620. The government money
now outstanding (Dacember 1), consists
of $346,681,016 ef United States, $107,
793,280 of Treasury notes issued by
authority of the law of 1890, $384 963
504 of silver certificates and $61,280,761
of standard silver dollars. With the
great resources of the government,
and with the honorable example of the
past before us, we ought not to hesitate
to enter upon a currency revision
which will make our demand obliga
tions less onerous to the government
and relieve our financial laws from
ambiguity and doubt.
REVISION POSSIBLE AND NEEDFUL.
"The brief review of what was ac
complished from the close of the war
to 1893, makes unreasonable and
groundless any distrust either of our
financial ability or soundness; while
the situation from 1893 to 1897 must
admonish Congress of the immediate
necessity of so legislating as to make
the return of the conditions then pre
vailing impossible.
"There are many plans proposed as
a remedy for the evil. Before we can
find the true remedy we must appro
ciate the. real evil. It is not that our
currency of every kind is not good, for
every dollar of it is good good be
cause the government's -pledge is out
to keep it so, but that that pledge will
not be broken. However, the guaranty
of our purpose to keep the pledge will
be best shown by advancing towards
its fulfillment.
"The evil of the present system is
found in the great cost to the govern
ment of maintaining the parity of our
different forms of money that is,
keeping all of them at par with gold.
We surely cannot be longer heedless of
the burden this imposes upon the peo
pie, even under fairly prosperous con
ditions, while the past four years have
demonstrated that it is not only an ex
pense chsrge upon the government but
a dangerous menace to the national
credit.
PROTECTION AGAINST BOND ISSUES.
"It is manifest that we must devise
some plan to protect the government
against bond issues for repeated re
demptions. We must either curtail the
opportunity for speculation, made easy
by the multiplied redemptions of our
demand obligations, or increase the
gold reserve for their redemption. We
have $900,000,000 of currency, which
the government by solemn enactment
has undertaken to keep at par with
gold. Nobody is obliged toured eem in
gold but the government The banks
are not required to redeem in gold.
The government is obliged to keep equal
with gold alljts outstanding currency
and coin obligations, while its receipts
are not required to be paid in gold.
Tnev are paid in every kind of money
but gold, and the only means by whish
the government can with certainty get
gold is by borrowing. It can get it ia
no other way when it most needs it.
The government, without any fixed
gold revenue, is pledged to maintain
gold redemption, whi:h it has steadily
and faithfully done, and which, under
the authority now given, it will con
tinue to do.
"The law which requires the govern
ment, after having redeemed its United
States notes, to pay them out again as
current funds, demands a constant re
plenishment of the gold reserve. This
is especially so at times of business
panic and when the revenues are in
sufficient to meet the expenses of the
government.
CLEVELAND'S BOND ISSUES AS A WARN
ING
At such times the government has
no other way to supply its deficit and
maintain redemption but through the
increase of its bonded debt, as during
the administration of my predecessor,
when $262 315,400 of 4 per cmt. bonds
were issued and sold and the proceeds
went to pay the expenses of the gov
ernment in excess of the revenues and
sustain the gold reserve. While it is
true that the greater part of the pro
ceeda of these were used to impply de
ficient revenues, a considerable portion
was required to maintain the'gold re
serve.
"With our revenues equal to our ex
penses, there would be no deficit re
quiring the issuance of bonds. But if
the gold reserve falls below $100,000,
000, how will it be replenished except
by selling more bonds? Is there any
other way practicable under existing
law? The question then is, shall we
continue the policy "that has been pur
sued in the past; that is, when the gold
reserve reaches the point of danger,
issue more bonds and supply the needed
gold, or shall we provide other means
to prevent these recurring drains upon
the gold reserve? If no further legis
lation is had and the policy of selling
bonds is to be continued then Congress
should give the Secretary of the Treas
ury authority to sell bonds at long or
short periods, bearing a less rate of in
terest than is now authorized by law.
GOLD FOR UNITED STATES NOTES BOTH
GOING AND COMING
"I earnestly recommend, as soon as
the receipts of the government are
quite sufficient to pay all the expenses
of the government, that when any of
the United Spates notes are presented
for redemption in gbtd and are re
deemed in gold, such notes shall be kept
and set apart, and only paid out in ex
change for gold. This is an obvious
duty. If the holder of the United States
note prefers the gold and gets it from
the government he should not receive
back from the government a United
States note without paying geld in ex
change for it. The reason for this is
made all the more apparent when the
government issues an interest bearing
debt to provide gold for the redemp
tion of United S sates notes a non in
terest bearing debenture and should
not pay them out again except on de
mand, and for gold. If they are put
in any other way they would return
again to be followed by another bond
issue to redeem them another interest
bearing debt to redeem a non interest
bearing debt.
TH8 BANKS SHOULD BEAR SOME OF THE
BURDEN.
" in myjview, ic ia oi me utmost lm
portance that tne government should
be relieved from the burden of provid
ing all the gold required for exchanges
and export. This responsibility is alone
borne by the government without any
necessary backing powers to help its
relief. - The banks do not feel the strain
of gold redemption. The whole strain
rests upon the government and the size
of the gold reserve in the treasury has
come to be, with or without reason, the
signal of danger or of security. This
ought to be 8 topped. If we are to have
an era of prosperity in the country,
with sufficient receipts for the expenses
of the government, we may feel no im
mediate embarrassment from our pres
ent currency, but the danger still exists
and will be ever present, menacing us
so long as the existing system continues.
And besides, it is in times of adequate
revenues and business tranquility that
the government should prepare for the
worst. We cannot avoid without
serious consequences the wise consid
eration and prompt solution of this
question.
THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY'S
PLAN.
The Secretary of the Treasury has
outlined a plan in great detail, for the
purpose of removing that recurrence
of a depleted gold reserve, and save us
from future embarrassment on that ac
count. To this plan I invite your care
ful consideration- ,
"I concur with the Secretary of the
Treasury in his recommendation that
National Banks be allowed to issue
notes to the face valuo of the bonds
which they have deposited for circula
tion, and that the tax on circulating
notes S3cured by deposit of such bonds
reduced to one half of 1 per cent per
annum. I aleo jin him in recommend
ing that authority be given for the es
tablishment of National Banks with a
minimum capital of $25,000. This will
enable the smaller villages and agri
cultural regions of the country to fco
supplied with currency to meet their
needs.
"I recommend that the issue of Na
tional Bank notea be restricted to the
denomination of ten dollars and up
wards. If the suggestions I have here
in made shall have the approval of
Congress, then I would recommend
that National Banks be required to re
deem their notes in gold."
CUBA.
Turning to foreign affairs, tho Presi
dent devotes a great part of his message
to a consideration of the Cuban ques
tion, which he says is the most import
ant problem with which this govern
ment is now called upon to deal per
taining to its foreign relations. Tho
story of Cuba has for many years been
one ot unrest and for no enduring;
period has it ceased to cause concern
to the United States. Brie fly summar
izing tho history of the former out
breaks, the President then proceeds to
discuss the frsS head, namely, the reo
nition of belligerency.
RECOGNITION OF BELLIGERENCY NOW UN
WISE. He recalls the resolutions of Congress
in 1896 and since then. He quotes tho
wi3e utterances of President Grant in
his message of December 7, 1875, par
ticularly where he declares against the
recognition of independence at that
time and also President Grant's decla
ration that he failed to find in the in
surrection the existence of such a sub
stantial political organization and other
elements required by international
usage as would place it on the footing
of war to which a recognition of bellig
erency would aim to elevate it. Com
pleting his quotation from that portion
of President Grant's message, the
President says still further pertinent
considerations appear as to the prac
tical aspects of the questions. In the
code of nations there is no such thing as
a naked recognition of belligerency,
accompanied by the assumption of in
ternational neutrality. Such recogni
tion would not confer upon cither
part j to the conflict a statu? not there
tofore actually possessed and a recog
nition of belligerency, while nominally
equal, would weigh heavily in behalf
of Spain. She could only c'aim the
right of search on the high seas and of
seizure of contrabands, but her mari
time rights could ba asserted up to the
margin of our own territorial waters
and a condition of things would exist
for which the Cubans, within their
own domains, could not hope to create
a parallel. The United States would
acquire no right of intervention to en
force the conduct of the strife within
the paramount authority of Spaio, ac
cording to the international code of
war. "For these reasons," says the
Preeident, "I regard the recognition of
the belligerency of Cuban insurgents
as now unwise and therefore inadmis
sible. Should that step hereafter be
deemed wise as a measure of right and
duty, the executive will take it "
HAWAIIAN ANNEXATION FAVORED.
Tne President next takes up the sub
ject of annexation of Hawaii. He re
fers to this subject because the Senate
has made public the treaty now pend
ing and legislation is required to settle
many details of the eventful union,
should it bo accomplished, as he be
lieves it should be. Rapidly reviewing
the argument he has heretofore made
in favor of annexation, the President
says :
"If the treaty ia confirmed, as every
consideration of dignity and honor re
quires the wisdom of Congress will eeo
to it that, avoiding assimilation of ele
ments perhaps hardly yet fitted ta
share in the highest franchises of citi
z?nship, and having due regard to tho
geographical conditions, tho most just
provisions for self rule in local matters,
with the largest political liberties as an.
integral part of our nation, will be ac!
corded to the Hawaiians. No less is
due to a people who, after nearly five
years of demonstrated capacity to ful
fill the obligations of self governing;
statehood, come of their free-will to
merge their destinies in. our body
politic "
INTER NATIONAL BI METALLISM.
Coming to the question of an inter
national coinage agreement, the Presi
dent states that the special envoys rep
resenting the United States in the effort
to secure such an agreement, have
been diligent in their efforts to obtain
the ce operation of European countries,'
but up to this time have bsen un
able ta secure agreement contemplated
by7 their mission. The gratifying action
of France in joining this country in

that we are not alone among the larger
nations of the world in the desire to
