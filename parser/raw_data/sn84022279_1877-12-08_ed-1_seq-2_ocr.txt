TsrUirm-dIiss Wo all along the
earnest aiUocat of war as the only
meant promising anything like a defi
nite settlement of the vexed Mexican
question. V e are not fund of war tor
its own sake, indeed, we deprecate it,
and would only rmort to it a the last
resort to protect honor, life and propers
ty. As a measure of revenge we don't
believe in it, but as s meatu to secure
milwmpily for lossra sustained at the
hands of an enemy it ia not only jmtti
niie nui becomes a pressing and nui
mediate necessity, as well a duty.
Nome of tha great papers of the country
took u severely to tank for speaking
out for our remedy. Sine that time
two eminent and patriotic men from
Teaas ia tha senate of the United State
and six in the lower house bsv placed
before the country a moderate but
truthful statement of the wronps suf
fered by our patient lorWers. and have
awakened thesraipathy of the govern
ment and the people for us.
During the reign of bitter sectional
ism and prejudice, which stretched be
tween the periods when the war cloaed
and when Hayes was inaugurated, all
tha vital farts regarding the Mexican
outrages on the Rio Grande wer sidu
ously kept from the knowledge of the
people. Indifference was the rule.
Even the brave and devoted army made
sttong representations to the executive,
and they wer treated with corn or
indifference. It was no part of the
policy of the president to rudely inter
rupt the processes by which he was be
ing lifted from poverty to power and
wealth, and bring into fuvoraM notice
th people from whose necessities mon
y waa wrung, and upon whoa defeat
and humiliation his own and his com
peers' glory rested.
A short time sine it was announced
that th Mexican government had sen
heavy fore of troops to th K

so, and stand by tha declaration. This
beating about tba bush is unworthy

w hat w of the Texas frontier need i
immidiatt protection and rtliet Let th

enough to repel any force the Mexicans
can bring against it, and boldly declare
its purjes. snd from that moment the
outrages will cease.

that reinforcements are going forward
and th formal notice given the subject
by the president in his annual message.
are bom vast improvements over the

Evr sine tha 1st happy unitization
of too Texas delegation in congress upon

hat been tteadily gaining ground in

th last two deead has had a very oner

manfully bearing iu own proper share

a tor Patterson's couiuiiraion wbicb
must continue until constitution!!-

authority, it could not be said that
Patterson was a fugitive from justice,

Judicial cognizance that party organiz
ation is one thing and faction to de

civil forma of law to the dominance
and triumph of the passions of fac
