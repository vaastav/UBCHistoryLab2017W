ASKS A DISAVOWAL !
OF ANCOM ATTACK
Washington Sends Note to Vienna
Demanding Reparation for
Americans Lost on Liner.
ASSURANCES ALSO REQUESTED
WASHINGTON. Dec. 9. The
United States has sent to Austria
Hungary a note asking for a dis
avowal of the submarine attack upon
the Italian liner Ancona, assuraances
that such an act will not be repeated,
some degree of punishment for the
commander of the submarine and
reparation for the American lives
lost.
The communication started by ca
ble yesterday from the State depart
ment to Ambassador Frederick C.
Penfleld at Vienna, who was In
structed to hand It to the Austro
Hungarian minister of foreign af
fairs, Baron Burlan. Word of the
delivery of the note had not been re
ceived by the department tonight.
Terms Ar Firm.
Friendly but firm terms. It Is said,
characterize the document, which la un
derstood to make a particular point of
prompt assurances for the future safety
of American Uvea. Austria-Hungary haa
never informed the United States whether
the commanders of ita submarines had
been given instructions similar to those
which the German government gave to
its commanders after the Lusitania trag
edy. It la understood the note referred par
ticularly to the charge that shells from
the submarine killed or wounded some
passengers on the Ancona after it had
1 alted and asked for an explanation on
that point.
In dispatching the note Secretary Lan
sing acted with the approval of President
Wilson. It Is stated authoritatively that
the document, which is described as being
comparatively brief and decidedly vigor
ous in tone, was so drafted as to attempt
a settlement of the controversy at once,
without bringing on a series of communi
cations such as followed the sinking of
the Lusltanla.
Situation Grave.
High officials are said to be of the opln
Ion that the situation is one which calls
for grave consideration, the state of af
fairs having become more complicated
since the note was dispatched by repeti
tions of attacks on American oil-carrying
vessels in. the Mediterranean, presumably
by Austrian submarines.
News that the note had been sent came
as a complete surprise to official Wash
ington, the reports which emanated from
the state department early in the week
being that no positive and corroborated
evidence as to what actually had oc
curred when the Ancona went down had
been received. It was satd that the re
ports received were fragmentary, con
flicting or contradictory, and that until
a reply to the Inquiries submitted to
Austria-Hungary was received. It was
probable that no communication would
be sent to Vienna.
Definite Data Rerelred.
Tonight it was suggested In some quar
ters that Information of a moat' con
clusive nature had come to Socretary
Lansing, probably late Monday night,
and that it had been decided then that
the protest should go forward imme
diately. Whether Ambassador Penfleld
had transmitted the reply of the Vienna
foreign office to the list, of queries sub
mitted by the United States could not be
ascertained.
The belief prevails, however, that the
state department had received answers
or some sort to the queries. In the In
quiry Austria-Hungary was asked,
among other things, whether a warnine
shot had been fired before the ship was
shelled, whether time was given the
passengers to get to a place of safety and
after it had come to a standstill and be
fore the torpedo that sank it waa
launched.' The Auatro-Hungarlan em
bassy here had not been advised tonight
that the Inquiry had been answered and
it was said that the Italian ambassa
dor, who had transmitted much Infor
mation upon the sinking of the Ancona,
had not furnished the United States
with anything additional. ,
Dr. Crell'a Deposition. .
The Ancona was sunk in the Mediter
ranean sea on November 9, while bound
from Naples for New York. The only
testimony of a native American survivor
cf the liner before the department Is In
a deposition by Dr. Cecils Greil of New
York. In her deposition Dr. Greil asserts
specifically that the liner was torpedoed
while the men, women and children in
the' cabin and steerage were scrambling
to get into the small bpats. The depart
ment has teen inclined not to accept
this single statement as positive proof
unless corroboration was received from
some source.
Much weight was given, however, to
what Pr. Greil had to say. Her testi
mony waa considered of so much Im
portance thst she was taken to Rome,
where she told her story to Ambassador
Page. A report of this conversation
reached the State department recently.
After the Inquiry of the United States
had been befors the Vienna foreign of
fice several days Ambassador Penfleld
- reported that more time was desired in
which to frame a reply. Late last week
Secretary Lansing Instructed the ambas
sador to urge a prompt reply.
What Note Seta Forth.
The American note, it is understood,
sets forth that the United Kingdom can
not believe that the commanders of Aus
trian submarines have committed sn al
leged act of lawleaness except under a
misapprehension of orders Issued by the
Austrian naval authorities. It is de
clared that under methods of warfare
such as those employed In the sinking
of the Ancona it practically is impossi
ble under such circumstances to remain
within the rules of fairness, justice and
humanity.
The principles of humanity and Justice
which were championed in notes to Ger
many are understood to also be called
strongly to the attention of the Austro
Hungarian government in this communi
cation. Warning before submarine at
tacks is insisted upon. While every op
portunity Is said to be left for an amica
ble reply, the belief prevails in usually
well informed circles that the communi
cation is more vigorous than any dis
patched to Germany while Aha contro
versy with that country over the con
duct of submarine warfare was in prog-re-i.
Tke Aaalrlaa tea t loa.
No Intimation could be obtained tonight
whether the United Stales had determined
ahe'Jter any "misinformation" appeared
in the statements of the occurrence
which have been issued by the Austrian
admiralty. The Austrian contention waa
4a, v warning aoot waa fired, that the
CANADIAN CAVALRYMAN WORKING IN FLOODED
TRENCH The Canadians now in training in England be
fore being sent to the fighting front are put under condi
tions closely resembling actual warfare.

ship tried to escape, and .that when It
finally came to a stop after being hit
several times, fifty minutes was given
In which the passengers might have
taken to the boats.
At the end of that period It was claimed
another vessel appeared and the subma
rine submerged and torpedoed the Ancona,
which sank at the end of another pe
riod of forty-five minutes. It was denied
that any lireboats were fired at, but It
was said that some of the loss of life
was caused by failure of the commander
of the Ancona to act promptly.
The Italian statement on the subject
alleged that no warning was given before
the submarine started shelling the ship,
which immediately came to a stop and
that shells were exploded on the decks
of the vessel and In the lifeboats, kllling-
and wounding many passengers.
Just how many American lives were
lost on the Ancona never has been defi
nitely established. It is known that sev
eral naturalized citizens were lost. Re
ports on this point, however, have been
so conflicting that the State department
never has been able to compile an ac
curate list. The text of the American
note, it was said tonight, will be given
out for publication In the morning papers
of Friday.

MELBA HOLDS HER
PLACE WITH OMAHA
Wonderful Australian Diva Again
Charms a Multitude of De
voted Local Admirers.
THIRD CHARITY CONCERT A HIT
Ity IIRIRIKTTl M. HK.K.a.
One of the greatest favorites of
all the opera stars Is Madame Mclha,
and Wednesday she appeared at
the Auditorium under the auspices of
the Associated Retailers of Omaha,
upon what Is known as the Charity
Concert course, Omaha again paid
Us enthusiastic tribute to her won
derful singing.
As at the other concerts given In
this course, the vast auditorium was
well filled, with hardly a vacant
seat on the lower floor and only a
few back rows empty In the gallery.
To Judge from the general and spon
taneous applause which was given to
each artist on the program, every
one of the large crowd thoroughly
enjoyed the music. Double encores
were demanded after several num
bers, and the prolonged applause
brought at least one encore and
many bows of acknowledgement for
each number, but the first two.
Melbn'a Voice a Marvel.
Madame Melba's voice la in its prime.
Clear as crystal, brilliant, ami full of
that ramo purity of tonal beauty wh'e'i
has mado It one of the world's greatest.
One Is Impressed at each rrturnlng visit
with Its wealth of tone, it power, and
the flexlbll ty of Its great ramie. Maritime
Melba contributed three numbeis t the
program, ''The Mad Scene from Hani,
let," by Amhrolse Thomas, and a Lum
ber, "Addlo," from "I. Bohcme," itnd
"Chant Venetian," hy Pomburg, and t o
waits song, "Se Saran Rose," by Ardlti.
which Melba has made her own and
without which no Melba concert woj d
be complete. Madame Melba ro e t
dramatlo heights In thi first number,
which la a tremendous composition, mak
ing taxing demands upon the singer.
"Addlo" Melba sang In Omaha at h r
last visit and her interpretation of 1 1 s
and the Venetian song wero ratlsfy ng
to the utmost. The brilliant waits son?
was sung with all the ease notice Ulo
throughout the entire program and It de
lighted, as always, with Its sointlllat ni
joyousness.
Madame Melba was most gracious with
encores, and at the last when the audi
ence would not be content without an
other, she sang Tostl'a "Mattinatc," to
her own accompaniment.
Iter Assistants Capable.
Madame Melba was as fortunate In her
assistants as was Miss Farrar. for both
Miss Harrison and Mr. Parker were
worthy to be upon the program, and Mr.
St. Legor was an excellent a?compunlst.
Mlas Harrison is a thorough mistress
of her Instrument, playing with a mu
tlclinshlp and fluency of technique that
Instantly won her .a sure place In the
favor, of the audience. Her contributions
to the program were "Sonata in A Ma
jor," by Bocherlnl played with great
beauty of tone and care of phrasing
a novel and unique "Orlentale," by
Caesar Cul remarkable for its effect ot
oriental Instruments snd melody the
"Prise Song" from the "Master Singer,"
lovely adagio by Schumann and the
Krelslcr "Lelbesleld." Miss Harrison re
sponded to many encores.
Baratoae a lilt.
Mr. Parker endeared himself to tha
audience at the start by singing the
Prologue" to "Paggliaccl" In Engllst).
Ha Is tho possessor of a magnlf.cent bari
tone voice, rich, powerful and of great
range. His enunciation Is rematkably
distinct. He sings with taste and dra
matic force. Ills numbers were well
chosen and contained, beside the "Pro
logue, two iS'.rauss songs which were ex
cellently Interpreted, the "Don Juan"
Sennade by Tschalkowskl, a number full
of daszllng brilliancy. Mr. Parker Is ono
of the finest baritones who has been
heard for some time, and hs many en
cores and hearty applause wcr well oe
served.
The third concert of the series has up-
held the high standard set by the first
two and there Is cause for much re
joicing In musical Omaha.
