"Has Germany Spent Her $50,000.
000 in Vain?" Asks the
Matin of Paris.
LONDON, December 9.?In an edi
torial this morning dealing with Presi
dent Wilson's message to Congress the
Morning Post, referring to that passage
In which the President speaks of the
necessity of the United States holding
aloof from the conflict, so that "some
part of the great family of nation:?
should keep the processes of peace
alive," observes that if Mr. Wilson re
gards the nations as making one fam
ily, and in this domestic circle the
United States is included, it is at least
odd that the I'nited States should be
so majestically independent of the de
sires and feelings of her relatives.
The editorial proceeds to argue that
President Wilson strangely misunder
stands the nature of the conflict, which
it says is a struggle for the preserva
tion of civilization and not a mere
clash of contending ambitions.
"Allies Fighting for U. S."
Then, quoting passages from the
President's denunciation of the disloy
alty of naturalized citizens, the edi
torial contends that they are proof that
the entente allies are fighting indirect
ly for the United States.
"What." says the editorial, "stands
between America and 'creatures of
passion, disloyalty and anarchy* in
their armed millions but the British
fleet. For unless America is prepared
to renounce what President W ilson
calls a 'common cause of national in
dependence and poltiicnl liberty' she
is the next objective of t'.erman ambi
tions which go unslaked as long as
there remains one independent and freei
nation."
Criticism by Pnll Mall Gazette.
Expressing the view that President
Wilson's denunciation in his message
of the activities of war plotters was
too mild in general, and not sufficiently
discriminatory between unneutral con
duct and crimincil conduct, the P#ll
Mall GazeCte saws:
even goes^ so far as to suggest
that the acts of'an assassin or a dyna
miter are chi*#ly heinous as exhibi
tions of unneuf ral conduct, and that
equal censure must fall upon every
American who fails to "keep the scales
of judgmeeit ev? n and prove himself a
partisan of no 'nation but his own.' "
The Westminster Gazette comments
most synijMithei icaily upon the practi
cal difficvUaies confronting the Presi
dent and his ?'highly honorable rea
sons for rrvinq to keep his western
world railed oft, from European chaos."
but fears t.iai his denunciations may
even be re:.5ar4'.ed as compliments by
those to whom'they are addressed.

12:35 p.m.?"PeWsons who are born in
Germany and become American citi
zens cannot be excused for violating

tack upon President Wilson, nnyint*
that it has long known that he was
anti-German, but that he never before
had given rein to his hatred in this
fashion.
"This 'neutral' government's head
has hardly a word of reproach for the
shameless incitements of the jingo
press against Germany. * * * But he
insults as traitors, anarchists and dis
honorable persons those men in whom
love for the old fatherland lives and
who rise up against the despicable
things done against them daily."
The Kreuz Zeitung says that thus
far there has been no sufficient evi
dence of German plots against the
United states to justify the words of
the message.
"Re that as it may," continues the
newspaper, "Germany cannot be made
responsible for them. There is nobody
in Germany who approves of them.
President Wilson, however, seems not
to appreciate the psychology of those
who allow themselves to be induced to
commit such excesses through their in
dignation over the unscrupulous and
unlimited support of the enemy of
their old fatherland which America
permits itself through President Wil
son's policy."
The Vossische Zeitung uses over its
Washington dispatch summarizing the
message the headline, "Wilson Against
the German-Americans," but does not
comment upon the document. Comment
is likewise lacking in the newspapers
other than those mentioned.
"Animated by Righteous Anger.''
! PARIS, December 9.?T'nder the cap
tion "Gulliver Wakes I*p" Joseph Rei
nach, the political writer, in an article
in the Figaro comments at length on
President Wilson's message to Con
gress. He declares that the message
was animated by righteous anger, al
though not altogether free from meta
physics. It is evident, says M. Reinach.
that the President was moved to the
deepest indignation by the revelations
in the trial of the directors and sev
eral employes of the Hamburg-Ameri
can steamship line on a charge of con
spiring to defraud the government.
The Matin says: "The progressives,
the republicans and the majority then
draw together before the danger of
the German-American terrorist. Has
Germany spent her $50,000,000 in vain?"
"President Wilson, who is an honest
man. has finally lost patience," says
La Liberte, in commenting upon the
President's message to Congress. "His
message has been preceded by a series
of measures of a diplomatic nature,
showing a determination on his part no
longer to be scoffed at by William II
and by his agents."
The Journal des Debats STiys that if
President Wilson's message is dull on
the subject of neutrality it is vehe
ment against the attitude of certain
German-Americans. The newspaper
reproaches the President for not hav
ing protested when Relgian neutrality
was violated and war declared on
France.
Dutch Press Is Silent.
THE HAGUE, December 8, via Don
don, December 9.?The Dutch newspa
pers almost unanimously refrain from
commenting on the President's mes
sage, preferring to await the arrival of
its full text. The Nieuwe Courant,
however, says: "The message contains
nothing to arouse a belief that there is
a likelihood of a diplomatic breach be
tween the I'nited States and Germany."

George C. Mountcastle, Weighing
425 Founds. Had Been Despond
ent Because of 111 Health.
George C. Mountcastle, who was in
the livery stable business in this city
for a number of years and was forced
to give up the saloon business at
Brightwood when the Jones-Works law
became operative, died at his home,
Avanol, Prince Georges county, Md.,
yesterday afternoon from poison he is
said to have taken with suicidal intent.
He weighed 425 pounds, it is Btated, and
probably was the heaviest man in this
vicinity.
Dr. G. B. Heinecke was summoned to
Avanol to attend the heavyweight pa
tient. He found his condition so criti
cal that practically nothing could be
done for him. Mountcastle died in a
few minutes. Justice of the Peace Rob
ert K. Joyce and Sheriff A. Fulton
Gates made an investigation and con
ducted an inquest over the body this
afternoon.
About a year ago Mountcastle at
tempted suicide by shooting. He used a
pistol of small caliber and the bullets
failed to pass through his flesh to a
point where they could do much harm. It
is said at that time Mountcastle worried
over his physical condition and the fact
that he soon would be forced out of the
liquor business.
Despondent Several Days.
Only a few days ago, it is said, the
sick man was told that one of his feet
would have to b*- amputated because of
gangrene, and since tliat time he showed
feigns of despondency more pronounced
than at the tirnv he shot himself.
Mr. Mountcastle came to this city from
Richmond, V a., about twentv years ago
and opened a livery stable in Vermont
