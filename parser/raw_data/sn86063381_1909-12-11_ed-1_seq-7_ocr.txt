CAUSES A LOSS
OF ONE MILLION
ill Night Fire Sweeps City
of Kalamazoo, Mich.
HOTELGUESTSROUTED OCT
Three Hundred Half Clad People
Driven Into the Icy Streets, Many
to Remain Several Hours Without
ShelterFlames Finally Brought
Under Control by the Assistance of
Outside Fire Departments.
Kalamazoo, Mich., Dec. 11.One life
was lost, many firemen were over
tome by smoke, 300 hotel guests were
driven, half clad, into the icy streets
fend property valued at approximately
#1,000,000 was destroyed by a fire here
which was extinguished only after an
til night struggle by the combined
fire fighting forces of Kalamazoo, Bat
tie Creek and Grand Rapids.
Starting in the basement of the Star
Bargain House the flames, fanned by
strong southwest wind, spread east
iwird along the north side of Main
street, totally destroying the Burdick
Mouse, a four-story hotel and store
hwilding, covering more than half a
city block.
On an arcade running north through
the Burdick building to Water street
were half a dozen small1
commercial
establishments and these were burned
out.
Sweeping eastward on Main street
from the Burdick the flames ate their
way through the Postal Telegraph
feted American Express offices, Chase's
shoe store, Bowldeck's men's furnish
ing store, Kennedy's drug store and
other business places.
As it became apparent that the lo
cal fire department would be unable
to cope with the situation aid was
Summoned from Battle Creek, twenty
jftve miles east, and Grand Rapids,
ntty miles north.
1 Refugees Suffered In the Cold.
Quests in the Burdick House, warned
of their danger, fled hastily to the
street, many of them scantily clothed,
fknd some were compelled to remain
In the biting cold several hours be
fore finding shelter.
While the flames were raging in the
hotel a man suddenly appeared at an
Upper window and cried for help. Be
fore a ladder could be put in position
he disappeared and, it is believed, per
\shed in the fire.
The extent of the fire is attributed
to the fact that the city depends on
artesian wells for a water supply and
because the amount available was en
tirely inadequate. A large standpipe
at an asylum was connected with the
city mains, but afforded only tem
porary relief.
So great was the shortage of water
that at one time only two streams
could be directed upon the fire and
these barely reached to' the third
floors.
At 5:30 a. m. a city main was con
nected with a nearby creek and with
the aid of the Battle Creek and Grand
-Rapids firemen the flames at last were
brought under control.
RUMOR IS DECLARED UNTRUE
United States Has Not Demanded Ze
laya's Resignation.
Washington, Dec. 1 \The state
ment telegraphed from Nicaragua to
Suondon to the effect that the United
States had demanded the resignation
of President Zelaya and that he had
indicated his purpose to retire by the
end of the present month is declared
at the state department to be without
foundation. No demands of that char
acter have been made to the president
of Nicaragua, nor has the department
received any authoritative announce
ment coming from Zelaya himself
that he is contemplating retirement.
In fact the state department has
not received anything of consequence
from American officials in Nicaragua
for some days and the department is
without confirmation of the recently
reported engagements between the
lelayan and the revolutionary forcea
ftt Rama.
WATSON DENIES THE STORY
oet Says He Never Asked Favor of
Premier Asquith.
New Yoffe, Dec. 1/.William Wat
teon, the poet, at the Hotel Astof was
fesked about the statement cabled from
England that Miss Violet Asquith, the
daughter of the British premier, had
declared his reason for naming her
mother and herself as composites of
.IJthe poem, "The1
Woman With the Ser-
pent's Tongue," was that her father
liad refused to make Watson a knight
and had also refused to make him an
allowance from the British treasury.
"I never in my life asked Asquith
j*~lor either a title or a pension," said
Watson. "All I ever asked of him
Was to bestow an annuity on the penni
less widow of John Davidson, the
poet."

hall of an office building Emil Will

MESSAGE PLEASES QERMANS
Approve What He Says Regarding
Trade Wars.
Berlin, Dec. 1 AOfficial and journal
istic comment upon President Taft's
message to congress notes with ap
proval what he says regarding the un
likelihood of trade wars between the
United States and other countries as a
consequence of the maximum, duties
clause of the new tariff law. The
Tageblatt, which represents financial
and radical opinion, concludes a two
column review by calling the message
a friendly one. Mr. Taft's utterances
respecting Nicaragua, though consid
ered in official quarters as rather
vague, are taken to mean that the
United States will restore order in the
republic, an outcome which will be to
the advantage of the German trade
and German possessions there.
STRIKEBREAKERS DO
NOT LIKE THE COLD
Drop in Mercury Causes Many
to Desert Jobs.
itu
St. Paul, Dec. lv.It is reported
that when the mercury here hit
13 degrees below zero a large number
of imported strikebreakers in the Twin
City terminals and at the Minnesota
Transfer walked out of the yards to
ward the nearest fires, and some of
them, being ordered back to work, quit
on the spot.
Railway officials admitted that there
had been some desertions, as was to
be expected with a crowd of raw and
unacclimated men, many of whom
were strange also to the work but
they all said that the supply of new
comers was sufficient to stand a con
siderable subtraction without mate
rially impairing the working force.
Strike leaders continue to deny the
truth of optimistic statements given
out by railway officials and say the
tieup is complete. They expect the
real situation to develop when the new
men become weary of excessive cold
on duty, long hours and complicated
details of unfamiliar work, and when
trains pour in on them bound both
east and west.

ers have returned to work here and no

THERE IS N O LOSS IN BEING CAREFUL
But vice versa there is.
Should be examined at least once every school year. Unless a boy or
girl can see clearly without a strain what is presented to their vision
their progress must necessarily be slow. It is time wasted and money
lost to go on and ignore these conditions, and wrong to do so if they
can be corrected.
Perfect eyesight is the most inestimable of all blessings and can
be enjoyed more than anything else. Therefore there is nothing so
profitable as to preserve the sight.
