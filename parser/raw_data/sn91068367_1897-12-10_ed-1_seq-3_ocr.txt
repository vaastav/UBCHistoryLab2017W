Washington, December 6. At noon
' today the first regular session of the
Fifty-fifth Consres3 -was launched upon
the unknown seas of legislation. Simul
taneously at both ends of the capitol
Speaker Reed, in the house and Presi
dent Hobart in the senate, dropped
hehr gavels and called to order the
respective bodies over which tfhey pre
side. The ceremony attending: the
opening of congress, though compara
tively of a routine character and usual
ly devoid of dramatic incident, ex
cept as 1t marks the formal promul
gation of the policies of the adminis
tration as outlined in the president's
annual message. Is a spectacle which
lm some respects is regarded as the
greatest official event at the year at
the national capital. All Washington
attended. High and low. rioh and
poor, white and black, foreign ambas
sadors and street gamin, banker and
eggar, cabinet officer and department
messenger, Joined in witnessing the
starting of the lumbering, Intricate ma
chinery of legislation. All roads on
this day lead to Capitol Hill and the
noble architectural structure which
surmounts it with its classic outlines
and broad spreading dome.
Long before the hour for the assem
bling, the crowds began wending their
way to the American Acropolis. As a
sort of quasi official function, the rep
preaentatives of the foreign govern
ments, the social leaders and every
body who Is anybody in Washington
goes thither on this day. The elegant
equipages of the notables, many ol
them, emblazoned with coats of arms,
wiEh liveried footmen on the boxes and
drawn by prancing horses with silver
mounted trappings and jingling chains,
added tone to the occasion, as they
dashed up the broad avenue. At the
oapltol the crowd swarmed into the
corridors at an early hour and choked
the marble steps as they ascended to
Uhe galleries from which they were
to view the show. As is usual on such
occasions, the reserved galleries were
carefully guarded on 'both the house
and senate side, admission being only
by card, and the public had great dif
ficulty in 'wedgin-g Itself into the lim
ited space set aside for it.
No unusual incident marked the open
ing of the house. The formalities at
tending the inauguration of Che ses
sion are dry and, except as a spec
tacle, hardly repaid the crowds which
thronged the public and private gal
leries. Yet, with few exceptions, the
visitors sat through the whole proceed
ings. The floral tributes for the members
were numerous and 1n some Instances
Imposing. One, whltih attracted prob
ably more attention than any other on
account of its unique character, graced
the desk of General Grosvener, of Ohio.
It consisted of a huge tree of yellow
chrysanthemums and American Beau
ty roses under the nodding branches of
which stood an innocent looking toy
ianVb. It was a tribute from the Na
tional Wood Growers' Association. A
huge gavel. In red and White carna
tions, stood upon the speaker's table.
At fifteen minutes before noon the
floor was cleared of all persons ex
cept mmbfrs and officers. Soon af
terward, Mr. Bailey, of Texas, the
leader of the minority, and "Silver
Dollar" Bland, of Missouri, entered the
hall together. Mr. Dingey, the floor
leader of the house, smiTing and . af
fable as ever, came in just before the
speaker appeared. He had difficulty in
making his way to his seat, owing to
the pressure of those who desired to
extend tihe'Ir greetings. As the hands
of the clock pointed to the hour of 12,
Speaker Reed, attired in a black cut
away coat and wearing a red tie, push
ed through the green baize-doors from
the lobby and ascended the rostrum.
One crack of the gavel sirbdUcd the
din on the floor and the conversation In
th over-hanging galleries. The gavel
-with which the speaker called the
"house to order was presented to him
by J. C. G rones, sheriff of Knox county,
Tenn., who sent it 1n the name of the
"Stalwart Repub'.icans of East Tennes
ee.' The gavel 'is made of apple tree
wood which grew beside the loghouse
tn which Farragut was born. This
house stood at Lowes Ferry, on the
Tennessse river, six miles below Knox
rille. Ia the deep silence which followed
Che calling of the assemblage to order,
the prayer of the eminent English di
vine, Rer. Charles A. Berry, of Wolver
Hampton, England, who delivered the
lnvooat3on, was solemn and impres
sive. The speaker then Immediately direct
ed the clerk to call the roll. The roll
call showed the presence of 310 mem
bers. There were five vacancies from
death or resignation during the recess
and the credentials of the members
elect were read by the direction of the
speaker, who then administered the
oath of office to them.
On motion of Mr. Hopkins, republi
can, of Illinois, the clerk was directed
to notify the senate that the house was
ready for business, and on motion of
Mr. Dingley, a resolution w.is adopted
for the appointment of a committee of
three to Join the committee of the sen
ate to wait on the president and in
form Wm that congress was ready to
receive any communication he desired
to make. The speaker selected Mes3r3.
Oingley, of Maine; Grosvenor, of Ohio,
and Bailey, of Texas, for this honor.
On motion of Mr. Henderson, of
Iowa, a member of the committee on
rules, the rule at the extra session for
three day adjournments was vacated
and daily sessions to begin at noon
each day were ordered. There being
nothing to do but to await the recep
tion of the president's message, the
hoips-e took a recess.
The house reconvened at 1:40 o'clock,
-when the committee appointed to wait
on the president came down the centre
aisle and Mr. Dingley reported that
the committee had performed its mis
sion. 'The president," said he, "was
pleased to send to the two houses his
respectful salutations and to .Inform
them that he would communicate in
rrrUing."
Itr. Pruden, -who hod followed the
committee into the ball, immediately
presented the message of the president
which, by the direction of Speaker
Heed, was read at the clerk'a desk.
The message was listened to -with
great earnestness, especially the por
tions dealing with the question of re
vising our currency legislation and our
attitude toward Cuba. The president's
utterances on both subjects seemed to
impress the members deeply, but there
was no demonstration of any kind un
til the conclusion, when the republi
cans Joined in a sharp round of ap
plause. The reading consumed an hour
and twenty minutes.
On motion of Mr. Dingley, the mes
sage was referred to the committee of
the whole and ordered printed.
Mr. La-werence, republican, of Massa
chusetts, then officially announced the
death of his predecessor, the late Rep
resentative Wright, and Mr. Allen,
democrat, of Mississippi, the death of
Senator George. Out of respect to
their memories the house then at 1:05
p. m., adjourned until tomorrow.
The attendance upon the session f
the senate, both on .ne noor and in the
galleries, was notably large, despite of
the understood fact that little busi
ness beyond the presentation of the
president's message and the proceed
ings incident thereto would be trans
acted. Prior to the convening of the sen
ate, the members passed half an hour
in exchanging greetings. Senator Han
na, of Ohlo.who has been ill for a week,
was given a cordial reception by his
republican colleagues. Mr. Wolcott, of
Colorado, one of the members of the
International monetary commission,
was also given a warm greeting.
When the senate convened after the
recess, Hon. H. D. S. Money, the new
senator from Mississippi, entered the
chamber, but the oath of office was not
administered to him during the session.
The floral display was unusually rich
and beautiful, and the odor of flowers
was heavy 1n the hall.
The republican members were par
ticularly well remembered with floral
presents. One of the most notable of
Che offerings, 'both for size and beauty,
was that presented to Mr. Foraker, of
Ohio, a magnificent tree of American
Beauty roses set In a stand of ever
greens and ferns from the senator's
"republican friends of Columbus,
Ohio." Senator Butler, of North Caro
lina, received a horse-shoe of roses.
Precisely at 12 o'clock the gavel of
Vice-President Hobart fell and the
senate was called to. order. The invo
cation was delivered by Rev. W. H.
M'ilburn, the blind chaplain. He made
a beautiful and touching reference to
our "beloved president," who awaited
news from the bedside of the mother
to whom he is devoted, and prayed
that she might have a peaceful passage
to the celestial shore.
Seventy-seven senators responded to
their names on the roll-call.
The venerable Senator Morill, of Ver
mont, was first recognized by the vice
president. He offered a resolution
which was passed, in the usual form,
that the secretary inform the house
that the senate was in session and
ready to proceed to business.
Senator Allison, or Iowa, presented
a resolution that a committee of two
senators be appointed to Join a like
committee from the house to Inform
the president that congress was in ses
sion and prepared to receive and com
munication which he might desire to
make to it. The resolution was pass
ed and the vice-president named Sen
ators Allison and Gorman as the sen
ate committee.
By resolution of Mr. Cullom, of Illi
nois, the time of daily meetings of the
senate was fixed at 12 o'clock noon.
At 1:30 o'clock Senator Allison re
ported that the two committees had
waited upon the president, who in
formed them that he would immediate
ly communicate with congress in writ
ing and he expressed the hope that the
deliberations of congress might result
in great good to the country and re
flect honor upon itself.
The president's message was present
ed by Mr. Pruden, the president's as
sistant secretary, and was at 1:35 laid
before the senate and read. Senators
gave the closest attention to the read
ing of the message, a majority of them
following it from printed copies with
-which they had been supplied. That
part of the message which dealt with
the Cuban question and outlined the
policy of the administration with ref
erence to that question was listened
to with particular interest. The read
ing of the message was concluded at
2:30 o'clock. The document was order
ed printed for the use of the senate.
Senator Walthall, of Mississippi, was
recognized and announced the death of
his colleague, Hon. C. Z. George, of
Mississippi. After a lingering Illness,
Senator George died at Mississippi City
on the 14th of August last. By his
death, said Senator Walthall, the state
of Mississippi lost its most useful and
distinguished citizen and thi3 body one
of its most prominent and able mem
bers. Senator Walthall presented the
usual resolution of condolence with the
fabnily of the deceased senator.
The resolution was adopted, and as
a further mark of respect, the senate
adjourned until tomorrow.

Port au Prince, Hayti, December t.
trouble between Germany and Hayli. as
a result of the arrest and imprisonment
of Herr Lueders, an alleged German
subject, reached a crisis today. Two
German cruisers entered this port during
the morning and an ultimatum from the
germ an government was delivered to the
Haytian government, giving the latter
eight hours In which to grant the de
mands of Germany for an indemnity to
Herr Lueders. The' members of the
diplomatic corpe here believe the gov
ernment of the republic has decided to
accept the conditions of Germany.
In anticipation of trouble, the citizens
of German nationality sought refuge yes
terday on board two steamers which
were at this port and the French steam
er Vil'-e de Marseilles has been requisi
tioned by the French minister, in order
to serve as a place of refuge for French
citizens. The Ville de Marseilles has arr
rived here direct from Porto Rico.
The populace of this place Is in a state
of great excitement, but the Haytian
government has strong forces of troops
at its disposal and is resolved to main
tain order.
Port au Prince, December 6. p. m.
The population of the city late this after
noon, when this cablegram is sent, ap
pears calm, and the present indications
seem to confirm the supposition cabled
earlier today, that the government will
accept the conditions Imposed by Ger
many so far as money indemnity is con
cerned, and It Is also probable that,
yielding to superior force and in order
to avoid international troubles, the gov
ernment will accept the other conditions.
. The exact nature of Germany's de
mands on Hayti is as yet somewhat in
doubt, but it is understood that the Ger
man government asks: First, an indem
nity of $20,000 (American) for Herr Lue
ders: second, the promise that Herr
Lueders may return to Hayti and there
sojourn without danger of any kind:
third, a letter to the German govern
ment in which Hayti will express apol
ogy for the proceedings toward the Ger
man government in the Whole transac
tion; fourth, that the president of Hayti
hall graciously receive the German
charge d'affaires at Port au Prince.
It is this fourth demand to which the
most serious exception has been taken by
the Haytian government, as affecting
Hayti's honor and involving a deep hu
miliation, for it was Count Schwerin, the
German charge d'affaires at Port au
Prince who went before President Simon
Sam. and rudely submitted the demand
for indemnity and apology.
"Washington, December 6. Mr. Leger,
the minister of Hayti to the United
States, when asked today concerning
the Frankfort Zeltung's statement that
Hayti has agreed to pay the indemnity
askei In the case of Lueders, said that
he nad received no advices of any
change in the position taken by his gov
ernment: namely, that it stood ready
to pay cheerrully any proper indemnity,
provided it had the opportunity to de
monstrate whether this Indemnity was
properly collectable. The minister said
that he had received no advices from
Hayti since last Friday when the re
ported approach of two German naval
cadet schoolships caused rumors that
they were men-of-war coming to block
ade the island. It was predicted then by
the minister that great excitement would
follow the approach of the German ves
sels, but he has no reason to fear that
the stability of the government is en
dangered. Advices to the state department Indi
cate that the situation In Port au Prince
and Hayti generally is one of great com
motion, but no reference is made to any
threats against the government.
Kingston, J a.. December 6. Advices re
ceived here today from Port au Prince
show that serious trouble is Imminent in
Hayti. The streets of the capital are
placarded with "Down with the Govern
ment." and the troops have been ordered
into barracks.

G-rmny Invades Oh In
London, December 8. A special de
spatch from Shanghai says: On Fri
day last Captain Becker, with 210 Ger
man marines, left Kiao-Chou bay to
occupy the surrounding villages,
whence they proceded to capture the
city. The Chinese forts opened fire
and the Germans replied, killing three
of the garrison, which thereupon fled
in disorder. The Chinese general in
command was captured but afterward
liberated. Several German sailors
were injured by stones flung by the
inhabitants of the villages. In return
for this, the head men of these vTTTages
were beaten with bamboo sticks by or
der of the German commander. It is
reported here that China Is willing to
pay an indemnity of 1,000,000 taels
(about $781,250) and to grant all the
German demands, including the tempo
rary cession of Kiau-Chou bay and ad
joining territory.
A despatch to The Times from Pekin
confirms the report that China, hoping
for the evacuation of Kiao-Chou,
agrees unconditionallly to all the de
mands of Germany.
Berlin, December 7. Dr. Stuebel, the
German consul at Shanghai, has been
ordered to go to Kaio-Chou and es
tablish a Tegular German administra
tion. Why Germany 8elzd the Chinese Port
Pekin, December 7. The Chinese gov
ernment has caused it to be made
known that up to the time of the Ger
man occupation of Kiao-Chou bay no
claim was made by Germany for repa
ration as a result of the murder or the
two missionaries, Nies and Hennle, and
that there were no ether differences
between the two governments. Conse
quently the government of China points
out, that the missionary question is re
garded as a pretext to obtain a naval
station which, it is shown, Germany
long coveted. The Chinese govern
ment, it is said in conclusion, will never
consent to the Germans remaining at
Kiao-Chou bay, as their presence there
deprives China of a harbor which, since
the war with Japan, has been regarded
as the most suitable naval base of op-
ertions.

Washington, December 7. The inter

to extend for two years the period
within which railroads must comply
with the act of congress requiring all
railroads to be equipped with safety
appliances for the protection of the em
ployees and uassengers. The commis
sion this afternoon authorized the fol
lowing statement:
"In the matter of the application of
the Chicago and Alton Railroad Com
pany and other carriers to the inter
state commerce commission to extend
the period within which they shall com
nlv with the Drovisions of the act of
congress of March 2, 1893, commonly
known as the safety appliance act ana
upon which hearing has just been had,
tha commission has decided to extend
said period two years for the petition
ing carriers."
While the formal order and state
ment of facts and reasons constituting
causes for such extension have not yet
been prepared, it is understood that the
extension will not be conditional and
that the commission has under consid
eration the question of requiring quar
terly or other periodical repairs by
carriers during the two years period.
"I don't know, there may be others"

It was reported here early this morn
ing that Sonny Ryan, the white man
who so brutally murdered his wife at
Greensboro Saturday evening, was
lynched late last night, but a telegram
says he Is In jail and will be legally
tried and hanged. It was one of tha
worst crimes of the year.
The federal court began Its session
here today. Judge Purnell presiding.
There are 110 cases on the district dock
et, all criminal and nearly all for moon
shining. There are seventy-five cases
on the circuit court docket. The most
interesting case is that of John A.
Meeder, the fourth class postmaster of
Warren county who was perpetrating
so large a swindle when arrested.
Meeder was sending out from 100 to 400
letters a week and getting in 200 regis
tered letters. He had canceled f 90
worth of stamps in October.
The order of railway conductors for
this division held a very large me...Ing
here yesterday.
Some of the relatives of J. B. Barnes
the Rocky Mount man In jail here, are
here to see him. He wants to be trans
ferred to the penitentiary hospital,
claiming he will have pneumonia If he
remains in jail.
As yet the supreme court has never
filed an opinion in the case of ex-Chief
Clerk S. P. Satterfleld of the house.
Mention was made the other day of
the fact that the sheriff of Wayne
county had gone to Texas after a man
who four years ago murdered his wife.
Solicitor Pou of this district has di
rected that the man be placed in jail
at Raleigh for safe keeping.
The news that John C. Davis, the
Wilmington embezzler. Is to be dis
charged from the Insane asylum here
Is Interesting. There are people who
do not believe and never have believed
that Davis was insane.
The penitentiary will have truck and
strawberry farms on quite a large
scale on the Castle Haynes property
which it purchased last week.
It is now certain that P. H. Lybrook
will get the postmastershlp at Wins
ton. As to the Raloigh office every
thing is yet "in the clouds."
The rewards for Osborne Lambert,
the assassin of Engineer Bumgardner,
of the Southern railway, now aggre
gate no less than $1,100.
Mr. Hege, of the poultry experiment
farm here, says that the poultry show
at Ashevllle Is to be a grand one. The
special premiums aggregate over $700,
besides $1,500 in cash premiums. The
date Is January 4th. There Is also to
be a poultry show at Charlotte January
12-14.
It was decided by the state superin
tendent of public Instructions today
to call a state convention of county
supervisors of education, to be held
here December 30th in the hall of the
house of representatives.
There is quite a lively complication
about the smashed Piedmont bank at
Morganton. A telegram to State
Treasurer Worth from Bank Examiner
Crowder, who was put in charge of it,
says that he has locked the door, and
that Walton, who was appointed re
ceiver by Judge Hoke, has also put a
padlock on it. So neither Crowder nor
Walton can get In. The courts will
settle the matter. Chief Clerk Den
mark of the state treasury says he
learns that Judge Hoke, who appointed
Walton receiver, says he would not
have done so had he known that
Judge Robinson had appointed Cowles
receiver. Denmark says Cowles' ap
