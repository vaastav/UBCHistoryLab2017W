President Roosevelt's first annual
message is one of the most readable
state papers that ever
THE came from the White
MESSAGE. House. It is interesting
throughout, notwith
standing its great length. Each of the
many subjects touched upon is handled
in a style which holds the attention of
the reader to the close.
Naturally, after a touching tribute
to the memory of President MeKinley,
the president takes up the question of
dealing with anarchy, and his vigor
ous language and wise recommenda
tions will have the commendation of
every good citizen.
The need of a powerful navy is
pointed out, and the president argues
sensibly that the surest means of main
taining peace is through showing that
the nation at all times Is prepared to
protect the rights of its citizens. No
foreign power can take exception to t::e
programme announced,' for Met Roose
velt leaves no room for doubting that
the foreign policy of the United States
is one of peace and friendship with
all the world.
The country will uphold the purpose
of the president to strengthen the
morale of the army by making it
known that promotions are to b
strictly for merit. !
The re-enactment of the Chinese ex- I
elusion law is forcefully recommended,
and in this the president shows that
he is In close sympathy with Ameri
can sentiment. -As
a- matter of course he commends
the excellent workings of the gold
standard.
Strong ground is taken in favor of the
Nicaragua canal, and also the Pacific
ca bio.
On all the topics treated, in short,
the president not only takes a position
of broad Americanism and unexcep
tionable republicanism, but he makes
good his promise that he would close
ly follow the policies of President Mc
Kir.Iey. Nothing else was expected.
Perhaps the country generally has
awaited with most interest Mr. Roose
velt' expressions on trusts and reci
procity, and here again It is seen that
while discussing these subjects In his
own style and from a standpoint of!
strong personal convictions, he has in
no wise departed from the doctrines
laid down by AleKinloy, and by himself
in his great speech at Minneapolis- in
September.
Altogether, the mcsage is an excep
tionally able and candid paper, and will
be so pronounced by all unbiased crit
ics; Throughout, while expressing in
the frank and straightforward Roose
velt fashion the views of the chief
magistrate, it is pitched in a tone of
conservatism such as was expected by
those who know the president best.
Perhaps no subject discussed by the
message will be read with greater in
tere?t in the west than the portion
which deals with the conservation of
the flood waters and the reclamation
of the arid lands. It was already
known, to be sure, that the president's
accure knowledge of western conditions
und his strong friendship for western
people would make his advocacy of a
liberal national policy a certainty, but
his specific recommendations have
been awaited with conpMerable iur
ioaityi Hern ateo, hp is wisely con
servative. After rutnn iig up the Pil
uation in the arid regions, his recom
mendations In brief are. that the gov
ernment should proceed slowly and
carefully In working out a policy of na
tional irrigation, with an eye single
to the reclamation of the Ianda now
vacant, for the benefit of bone fide
home-seekers, and he suggests that
"ultimaaely it will probably bo neces
sary for the nation to co-operate with
the several arid Ftates in proportion as
there states by their leg;a!tion and
administration show them-elves fU to
receive it."
If congress derides to extend the aid
of the nation In th" rc lamination of
the arid I;imlt. Arizona will probably
h- ejii'.ng the first benefited, as the xev
for the Indians on the Pima reserva
tion, but would furnish a supply for
many thousands of acres now lying
vacant in the middle Gila valley. Tak
ing It for granted, however, that con
gress may accept the views and recom
mendations of the president, there in
still nothing in the policy announced
which promises any direct benefit to
the Salt River valley. Indeed, should
nothirg be done locally, and should
congress at some time in the future
favorably consider the construction of
a reservoir on the Salt River, It would
more than likely prove a detriment to
the interests of the present ranch own
ers, as lurga areas out3ide the present
canal limits would have to be included
in the proposition beforehand in order
to gain any considerable strength for
it at Washington.
migration directs attention to the weak
place In our barrier and shows con
gress how to strengthen it.
In his second paper on "The Settle
ment of the West,", in the December
Century, Emerson Hough gives some
details regarding southwestern wagon
trains. The story of the Santa Fe trail
has been told by many writers, and its
chief interst here is simply as showing
the eagerness with which the men of
that day seized upon every meuns of
transport In their power. ,and the nkiH
and ingenuity with which they brought
each to perfection. This wagon freight
ing of the southwest was highly sys
tematized, and was Indeed carried on
with almor.t military regularity. The
route was by way of the Council Grove,
then the northern limit of the Coman
ches' range, and It was at this point
that the organization of the wagon
train was commonly completed. A
train master or captain was chosoi; and
the whole party put under his com
mand, each man having his position,
and each being expected to takes his
turn on the night watch which was
necessary in that land of bold and hos
tile savages. During the day the train
moved in two columns, some thirty
feet apart, each team following clore ;
upon the one immediately preceding It
in the line. In case of any alarm of
Indians, the head and rear teams of the
two parallel columns turned in toward
each other, and thus there was formeJ
upon the moment a long parallelogram
f wagons, open in the middle, and in
closing the loose riding animals, and
closed at the front and rear. The
wagons were loaded, to a great extent,
with cotton stuffs In bales, and these
made a fair fortification. The-Indians
had tSiIicuIty in breaking the barricade
of one of the hardy caravars, defended
as it was by numbers of the best rifle
men the world ever knew. Small parties
were frequently destroyed, but in th?
earlier days a train was commonly
made up of at least luo wagons with
perhaps 00 men in the party, and with
&') mules or oxen. The goods in con
voy in such a train might be worth
half a million dollars. The time i.i
transit was about ten weeks, the out
trip being made in the spring and the
return in the fall.
Twenty years ago Jules Vern wrot
a stpry entitled "Twenty Thousand
Leagues TTnder the Sea." In is a ship
runs under the sea, being con t rolled
at will by electrical apparatus. It was
held to be a wild Might of the Imag
ination, but now Verne is dyln i'i
poverty and obscurity in Paris, while
the new submarine boat, the Fulton, in
performing all that he predicted, be
ing able to stay on the bottom of
j the sea at will and rise to th top
(whenever lis pleases. It Is remark
able that the imaginative feats that
Verne set forth In his works twenty
years ago have nearly all been achiev
ed in the present, which is another Il
lustration of the fact that truth
stranger than fiction.

in London, wan given a reception ti
Chicago the other night. Among the
speakers was Judge Marcus Kavanagh.
He was introduced as a man who had
swayed thousands with his oratory.
He began pompously enough. "Jn the
word3 of the great Napoleon, 'One with
God, is a majority: " . "Hold on!"
cried Rev. Mangasarian, who was
present, "Frederick Douglas; said that."
"Did he?" asked the judge, "I thought
it was Napoleon," but the interruption
had floored the speaker, and he was
obliged to sit down with his burning
thoughts all unexpressed.

M'KINLEY AND THE UKI'OIITKU
The campaign for the presidency of
the new republic of Cuba is progres
sing toward a stage where our Ii tin
American wards are beginning to dis
play an excitement natural to thoir
temperament. It must have been emo
tion rather than cool Judgment that
moved the leader of o ne of the fac
tions supporting Masii to send a teic
pram to I'resident Koosevelt asking
him, in effect, to h-ve the members of
our present military government in
Cuba preserve neutrality. Any observer
of our administration in the islapd
knows that its absolute impartiality
has been most conspicuously displayed
in tile munic.pal elections. There will
be no departure from this Impartiality
during the presidential election. It will
be the duty of our officers there to see
to it that the election Is orderly and
honest. That will be the extent of tht-ir
function. Palma, who has the supiKrl
of Maximo Gomez, represents the con
servative element, and his election
would mean, probably, the observance
in good faith of the conditions pre
scribed by the so-called Piatt amend
ment to the constitution. The candi
dacy of Masso represents the reaction
ary element. It is said that Palma
favors annexation; but the election of
Masso might have the effect of hasten
ing annexation, through the desire of a
people anxious to be saved from themselves.

If the Mexican government grants
the concession asked for by the at
torney for the Chinese counsel at Sjvn
Francisco and his associates, it will be
necessary for the I'nilcd States to es
tablish a continuous chain of patroej
along lh Mexican border and coast
guard r.tatlotis on the shores of south
ern California. It is the avowed pur
pose of the applicants to run steam
ships between Mexico and China and
colonize the state of Sonora with a mil
lion coolies. Their ability to carry out
thi plan is dmihtful, hut it Is uit
certain that any large number of Chi
nese imported, to Sonora would be a
constant menace to American labor,
because they would drift over the line
in preference to remaining in Mexico.
Most of the Chinese who have entered
the United States in violation of law
have ehme by way of Mexico and Tirit
ish Columbia, crossiir.g the line surrep
titiously and often with connivance of
officials especially charged with the
l'ty of Uw-i ing them out. The chief
defect of the exclusion laws is the
