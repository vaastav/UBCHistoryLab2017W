LIFE OF BABY SAVAGE.
THE TREATMENT WHICH INDIAN
PAPOOSES RECEIVE FROM
- SQUAW MOTHERS.
Indian Redskin Very Seldom Cries-Is
strapped to a Flank, Washed in the
Creek and Hung on a Tree to Dry
Out.
In the Indian papoose child nature
ia essentially the same as in the Cau-
casion babe, though there is a strik
ing contrast in their manners, due to
maternal treatment, .or as a student of
child nature might say, to environ
ment. The chief differences, really,
between the little Indian and the little
white is that the former is less a cry
baby than the latter. The reason for
this ts that the white baby usually gets
what he 'cries for if it be within moth
ers' power to procure it, Learning this
from experience, for every mother
knows how wise and shrewd the baby
is, whenever he feels that a certain ar
ticle would conduce to his content
ment, he forthwith howls. Now, the
papoose, so far from being encouraged
in this vocal exercise, is repressed. His
mother is unresponsive and the baby
not achieving what he weeps for, soon
learns that tears and wails profit not.
Perhaps if the white mother dwelt
in the deserts or the mountains so that
baby's crying would not disturb the
neighbors even she might let him cry
till weariness brought sleep, and per
haps if the redskin mother lived
among sensitive neighbors she might
seek to pacify the crying babe with

and
bribes that the neighbors might not
charge her with neglect of maternal
duty, or her baby with an evil disposi
tion. Yet another reason for the calm
and placid habit and orderliness of the
papoose as compared with his fair
brother is that the darker little sav
age has no cradle, crib or go-cart to
sport and gambol In, but is either
packed tightly in a basket or strapped
to a board. In this-position he finds
kicking and squirming uncomfortable
exercise and his enforced repose de
velops into habit.
So, the stoicism and the taciturnity
of the Indian are nurtured In early
youth, though of course one reason for
the Indian's lack of fluency in speech
Is that in his life and thought he has
not the need of many words. The
primitive white man was not voluble.
Bath Day of Papoose.
The papoose has no nursery luxu
ries as little pale-face babes under
stand that phrase. He has no soft and
tepid water prepared for him by a
faithful maid or a fond mamma. He
Is never lathered o'er with perfumed
soap nor dusted with sWeet-scented
powders. At intervals, usually two or
three times a week, the mothers of
the tribe or band take their babies to
the nearest creek, pool or spring, un
strap the little ones and tumble them
1 into shallow water, where they have
,ji splashing time while the mothers
swap the gossip of the tribe, for
squaws are very feminine in their love
of personal news and chit-chat involv
ing other squaws, bucks and braves.
When the bath is ended a cloth is
tied round the baby and he is hung
up on the branch of a tree or a sapling
till sun and wind have dried him.
Then he is packed in his basket and
trundled on his mother's back home
ward to the family tepee.
Death for Weakling Babies.
Nearly all Indian children that one
sees are hardy and well formed. This
is because only those of robust consti
tution survive the trials and exposure
of their babyhood. It is desired that
only the naturally strong should sur
vive, tor it is a custom in most of
the tribes to wilfully expose, sulTocn e
or drown born-weaKlings or deformed
babies. Death is the lot of tiie un
happy little baby whose liealin and
physique are below the tribal standard.
The Albino child, and these" are more
common among the Indians than might
be supposed, is certain to perish soon
after birth, because the coming of such
a child is regarded as evidence of dis
pleasure of the Great Spirit.
The redskin babe is released from
his lacings and swaddlings as soon as
he is old enough to walk, and then
his real child life begins. He has
great freedom. When it is warm
enough to go without clothes, and the
Indian child is inured to cold, he tum
bles and romps naked. His pets are
dog's and ponies n'nd is as fond of
these as are his blond cousins. As he
grows old enough to run he takes an
interest in the athletic sports of the
tribe and the usual young Indian games
are deer and hounds, hide and seek,
foot racing, pony racing, bow and arrow
shooting, spear throwing, wrestling,
and follow the leader.
Developing: the Brave.
The child is given every possible en
couragement to play and is never
whipped by his parents, because it is
the Indian's philosophy that whipping
breaks the spirit of the child and the
Indian ambition is to be brave and
self-reliant. It is a fact that though
:lie Indian child is not subject to cor
poral punishment and the ruder forms
)f discipline which white children are
:iften made to endure, they are rever
se t, obedient, docile and extraordina
rily respectful toward their parents
and seniors. It is the Spartan quality
which the mother and father strive to
develop in their boys.
School of the Indian.
The Indian lad of the wilds is not
oppressed with book studies. He is
tnr.ght his nature lessons in the for
est, among the rocks or on the plains.
He learns by hunting, and camping
with his elders, and every Indian lad
tiies to win the prize of commendation
by proficiency in those nature studies
which the Indian holds is the highest
form of knowledge. It is around the
camp fire, or the fire in the lodge, that
the youth learns the traditions of his

Japan Stands for Open Door and a

Welcomed.
Japan is inclined' to resent the re
currenco of allegations in the news'
papers of this country that she has
designs upon the Philippines. In an
address before the members of the
Cleveland Chamber of Commerce,
lion. Kki lliokl, First Secretary of the
Japanese I-cgatlon, expressed in no
uncertain terms what is believed to
be a de-Unite- statement of the policy
of the Mikado with reference to the

attitude of that nation in her future
industrial and commercial life. Mr.
lltoki lays special emphasis upon the
frank and authoritative disavowals of
the frequently-reported ambition of
Japan to absorb the Philippine Islands
for her own people.
'Tor the sake of argument." said
Mr. lliokl, "laying aside entirely lor
the moment consideration of the mo
tive of Japan regarding tlie present
subject, let me ask you a question.
Can you believe that this great Amer
ican people who glory in their national
spirit in their gigantic strength, in
their boundless wealth, in their mar
velous development, and look forward
with proud and confident anticipation
to the time- when they shall be the
first in tlie race civilization has set
for man to run, would allow her flag
to be lowered, be it in the Philippines
or anywhere else which legitimately
belongs to her, by any bands but tiers?
No, most emphatically no. That is
tlie spirit with which you c'ling to
your new possessions in the Pacific
and that ought to lie the spirit of the
people who respect honor and justice.
Would Mean Gigantic War.
And who can better understand
that spirit of tlie Americans than the
Japanese? Therefore, if Japan har
bored such a sinister design as is at
tributed to her, she must be prepared
to plunge In a war far more gigantic
than the one just ended against a na
tion to which she owes much that
sln is to-day and to whose people' she
owes that moral and financial support
so unreservedly given at the most
critical period in her history. No,
the Philippines are not worui the sac
rifice of such a valuable friendship as
that of America and the enormous
losses in men and money which such
a war would necessarily entail. Nor
is Japan in a position to carry on an
other costly war, but for self-defense.
For Open Door In China.
"The increased prestige of Japan
turned the eyes of the world toward
tlie problem of what influence Japan
will wield over China. Some people
go so far as to assert that Japan
will control China, proclaim tlie Mon
roe doctrine for Asia, and drive out
from the East all tlie white devils
and exterminate tlie Western influ
ences within its borders.
"Without questioning either the
value of tlie principles contained in
tlie so-called Monroe doctrine or Its
applicability to the Eastern situation
at- present, I can simply say that such
an idea has not entered into tlie Japa
nese mind and such a policy has not
seen even tlie symptoms of formation
For tlie maintenance of the integrity
and independence of China, Japan
joined hands with Great Britain. Eor
securing equal opportunities in China,
Japan lent her eager efforts to the
United States to make the open door
policy effectively operative.
Competition with America.
"It is absurd," continued Mr. lliokl.
"to say that in the course of a few
years American goods will be crowded
out of tlie Chinese market by Japa
nese competition. The main ground
upon which rests this apprehension is
that Japan has cheap labor at com-
nnnd. But labor in Japan does not
remain cheap. The effect of the Chi
na-Japan war wns to double the
price of labor, and the war with Rus
sia must raise it much higher. In
spite of these disadvantages Japan
must develop her commerce and indus
try, nnd she will hav to compete
with all the world, friend or foe. Her
commercial war will be fought Just
as fairly and squarely as the real war
Slip asks no favor from China that is
not granted to the entire world. She
stands for the open door and. in the
words of your great President, 'a
square deal.
American Capital Welcomed.
"Japan welcomes capital and mater
ial from any country. The United
States is supplying materials for im
portant Japanese industries; why can
rot she supply the capital? Why can
there not be n commercial alliance be
tween Japan and the United States?
We are willing to divide a fair share

of the protlts wherever gained with
any people. The United States has

"The future of the Orient is great.
nnd the greater it is the better for the
world. With peace guaranteed by the
Anglo-.Tapanese alliance, ana equal op
portunities in Korea and China se

BLACK WALNUT NUTMEGS.
Bishop Potter Was Sure That He
Was Tasting the Real Article.
The power of suggestion is not
merely a phrase; it really is a, power.
It has the strength to deceive men in
the matter of cigars, wines, whiskeys
and what not. It is a force in medicine
as every doctor knows. It is an agent
in therapeutics. The power of sug
gestion and the force of example are
intimately related. But to illustrate
the pranks which suggestion may play
with one's palate the following story is
told on Bishop Potter, a reverend gen-
tleman of ecclesiastic note and recent
Subway Tavern fame
In the course of his diocesan ram
bles he called on an old friend from
the South. It was evening, and the
bishop was invited to supper, not din
ner, for as people of the South know,
the appropriate time for dinner is mid-
day and the meal after candle-light ia
supper. One of the dishes served was
cottage-cheese or as it is more often
called in the language of the olden
time "smear-case." This is often eaten
under a plentiful dressine of cream
and sugar. The bishop elected to have
a "mess" of "smear-case" but his ap
petite craved a little grated nutmeg as
a flavor. This was embarrassing to
the host's wife at the foot of the sup-
pei lBU,e uuisue gam to Aunt uinan,
who wauea on taoie, "Aunt uinan,

"She ain't got none. She done use

reported Aunt Dinah.
"Well, then, run down to Miss Bet
sy's and see if she's got a nutmeg,"
said the troubled hostess, who talked
with augmented vivacity -and anima
tion to make the time pass quickly till
that nutmeg should be brought. Soon
Aunt Dinah came in, her black face
wreathed with triumphant smiles, and
placed before the bishop the mess of
"smear-case" generously sprinkled
with grated nutmeg.
"Ah," said the bishop, speaking with
that tone of complacent assurance,
coming from a consciousness of a per
fect familiarity with his subject,
smacking his lips and beaming with

PRESERVING THE FORESTS FROM

CRUSADE HEADED BY PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO PREVENT

RICHARD HAMILTON BYRD.
Reserving forests in the west from

now to nearly sixty million acres; but
UlL 1(lwi of
applying tills principle to
the older forests in tlie eastern states
may be new to some people and yet
is becoming a prominent one. Noth
ing is giving it popularity and Import
ance so much as tlie great interest
manifested by the President in the
subject.
There are proposed great national
reservations in the Southern Appala
chian forests, in the White Mountains,
in Minnesota, and in other eastern
states, entirely separate and apart from
tlie great reservations in the west.
President Hoosevelt is an arch disci

Tlie President said:
"I want to say a word to you on a
special subject in which all the coun
try is concerned, but in which North
Carolina has a special concern. The
preservation of the forests is vital to
the welfare of every country. China
and the Mediterranean countries offer
examples of the terrible effect of de

phy, and therefore ultimately upon
the national well-being of tlie nations.

of their effects upon tlie water supply.
Neither state or nation can afford to
turn these mountains over to the un

set on foot similar to that so fortu
nately carried out in the high Sierras
of the west by the national govern
ment. All the higher Applachians
should be reserved, either by the
states or by the nation. I much pre
fer that they should be put under na-
tional control, but it is a mere truism
to say that they will not be reserved
either by tlie states or by the nation
unless you people of the South show
a strong interest therein.
Would Prevent Floods at d Create
Water Power.
"Such reserves would be a paying
investment, not only in protection to
many interests, but in dollars and
cents to the government. The im
portance to the soutnern people of
protecting the southern mountain for
ests is obvious. These forests, are
the best defense against the floods
which, in the recent past, have, during
a single twelfth-month, destroyed
property officially valued at nearly
twice what it would cost to buy the
Southern Appalachian reserve.
J he maintenance of your southern
water powers is not less important
than the prevention of floods, because
if they are injured your mauufactur- .
ing interests will suffer with them.
'1 ne perpetuation of your - forests,
which have done so much for the
South, should be one of the first ob
ject & of your public men. The two
senators from North Carolina have
taken an honorable part In this move
ment. But 1 do not think that the
people of North Carolina, or of any '
other southern state, have quite grasp
ed tlie importance of this movement
to the commercial development and
prosperity of the south."
The President's Message, to
Congress. '
The special message sent to Con
gress by tlie President on the South
ern Appalachian Reserve reads like a
story. It touches upon the interest in
the subject of tlie scientists and the
lumberman, of the geologist and the
farmer, the meteorologist and the
fruit grower, the business man and
tlie eng'neer, anJ thp steamship pilot
and tlie honieseeker. The President
transmits with' his message a report
of tlie Secretary of Agriculture, pre
pared in collaiwratlon with the De
partment of the Interior, upon the
forests, rivers and mountains of the
Southern Appalachian region, and up- '
on its agricultural situation as affect
ed by them, and says in part:
The report of the Secretary pre
sents the final results of an investiga
tion authorized by the last Congress
Its conclusi ins point unmistakably, in
the judgment of the Secretary and in
my own, to the creation of a nntlonal
forest reserve in certain parts of the
Southern States. The facts set forth
an economic need of prime importance
to tlie welfare of the South, and hence
to that of the nation as a whole, and
