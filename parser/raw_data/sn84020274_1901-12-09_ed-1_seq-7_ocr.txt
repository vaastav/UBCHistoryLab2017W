"MAMMON WORSHIP -

GRASP AFTER SHINING GOLD.
Says This Idol Set Up in the

Tho Reverend James T. Coffey, pas

yesterdaj the second of his series of ser

his Epecilio theino "Mammon Worship
Anions' the Common lVdple." Ills text was
Slatthev." l. 19: "Lay not up tu yourseles
treasures on earth; where the rust and
moth consume, and where thieves break
through and steal."
"The devotees of tho money-sod are not
confined to the rich; they are found to-day
ln scores among; those less faored by for
tun." said Father Coffey. ".Many of the
poorer and humbler classes grasp ufter
tho shining roIJ with ns much aUdlty and
as fatal results as their hlshly favored and
opulent uelghbois. In this fevered quest.
spreading uay by day, we find tho source
of many of the evils affecting modern so
ciety. "This idol set up In the humble home of
thu laborer or wage-earner brings contin
ual trouble, turmoil and sad disappointment.
As with the rich, it supplants tho God of
our soul. Where God Is truly worshiped,
there, even in want mid poverty, there Is
peace and happiness. 'Blessed are the poor
in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven' Matt. v, 3), are the words of the
bavior ot mankind, i. e., blessed are those
who do not hx their he..rts upon the tran
sitory tilings of earth, for they shall nut be
disappointed.
"To seek riches and yet to be poor, to
long for the llesh-pots of Egvpt und yet
never to attain them, what a terrible condi
tion of miud and iieart this must produce!
"To see the golden fruit within reaching

To strive and jet see others ever win. What
consummate ngony! What fools these mor

Manila, Dec. S. Native scouts from Ben
gabon. Province of Xueva. Ecija. have
killed the American negro, David Fagin, a
deserter from the Twenty-fourth (colored)
Infantry, who for more than two years has
been leading Filipinos against the Amer
ican troops. The native scouts decapitated
their prisoner. The man's head, however,
tvaa recognized as that of Fagin's.
They also secured his commission In the
Insurgent army. Fagin had on one of his
finger, the class ring of Lieutenant Fred
erick W. Altslaettcr of the engineers, who
was captured by Filipinos, supposably un
der tho command of Fagin himself, Octo
ber 2S, 19C0. Fagin has been reported killed
on several occasions. The authorities are
satisfied that former statements ot his
death were erroneousu and that he ha
now been killed.
A military commission has sentenced the
Filipino General, Ifidore Torres, to be
hanged, after finding him guilty of ordering
the assassination of Corporal Fleldner of
the Twelfth Infantry at Malolos. Province

the commission has been dlsannrnvri hv
General Chaffee, who finds that tne comml-

whether General Torres personally ordered
the assassination of the American soldier.
General Chaffee thinks that the high rank
held by Torres In the Insurgent army would
have been sufficient to prevent such unmili-
Tary action on nis part.

REPUBLIC SPECIAL
Beaumont, Tex., Dcq. 8 A few days ago
a party of 23) members of the American In
stitute of Mining Engineer, passed through
Beaumont, and one train load of the excur
sionists were taken to the oil field for a few
minutes. The writer talked with several
members of the party after their return,
and each expressed the greatest surprise at
what he had seen on the magic Spindle Top.
They had read of the great activity In
this newest and greatest of oil fields, but
they had not even dreamed that what they
read could be true. When the train bearing
the party stopped a few, hundred yard, west
of the mass of derricks on Spindle Top,
which were almost as thick as trees in a
forest, many were the expressions of wonder
that came from the members of the party.
Still greater was their surprise when they
were Informed that a year ago Spindle Top
was only a bald prairie. The wonderful
transformation seemed hardly possible. The
prairie had been covered with derricks;
large steel storago itanks, some of which
have a capacity of 37,500 barrels of oil, had
seemingly grown out of the earth, and ev
erywhere the ground was seamed with pipe
lines, carrying oil to the city, to the Gulf
and to the loading racks of tho various oU
companies. That this was all planned and
accomplished within leas than a year was
a thing to be marveled at, even by men
who are accustomed to similar things.
Thought Prcaanrs Had Decreased.
When the party returned from the field
several of its members saidaf o tho writer
that the Impression had got out in the
North and East that the pressure under
Spindle Top had so far decreased as to
make pumpers of the wells; and that on thl.
account development had been practically
stopped. Believing this, their surprise at
seeing the field as It really Is, was Indeed
great.
The Beaumont old field has been a most
prolific source of wonders, but nothing is
more wonderful than the permanency of the
pressure that forces the oil out ot the
ground. It has set scientists to thinking,
and it has caused old oil men to wonder
what kind of a mighty force underlies this
wonderful hill. Professor C. F. Z. Cara
crlstl. a noted oil expert, visited the field
a few months ago and wrote a lengthly ar
ticle for a well-known trade paper, in
which he ventured the opinion that the
pressure would begin to weaken within a
short time. He returned two months later
and saw wells spouting from which thou
sands of barrels of oil had been taken, and
wrote that the wells would flow much
longer than the most sanguine scientist
could possibly estimate.
R.asla's OH Field Oatdoae.
Prior to Captain Lucas's discovery Rus
sia had the greatest oil field on earth, and
those who figure on this field", future do
so with reference to the Russian field; but
it Is fast being- proved that the figures ar
wide of the mark, and most of them are
already sadly in need of revision.
The Beaumont field already ha. the sci
entists puzzled in that the pressure refuses
to down as they had figured that It would.
and this is an Important factor in the field's
favor. It is known that fully 6.000,000 bar
rel, of oil have been taken from the Spin
dle Top wells, including- that which ha.
gone to waste, and, according to the views
cf the scientists, thl. should have material
ly weakened the pressure under' the hill.
That it has not done so may be stated as
a fact. Testa with pressure gauge, fan to
show any decrease of the pressure; on the
contrary, soma of the strongest wells in
the field are those recently ."broucht In" la
territory from whioh most of the oil has
been taken that has teen marketed.
Baa Had Staay Detraetars.
In the early day. of development every
thing possible was said and done to the
detriment of this field. Chemists made so
called analysis In which the oil was shown
to tie unlit for use In any way, and it was
decried in other fields. Catch-penny oil com
panies also assisted in giving the Held a
hard reputation, but it U living down these
hard knocks, and the value of the oil be

LUYTIES' LUICHERY.
To-Day, Monday, Dec. 9,
We Will Opea Luyt.es' L-wchery
AT 814 NORTH SIXTH STREET.
It will be a popular-priced restaurant and an up-to-date restau
rant in every particular. Our opening of this restaurant is a logical
proposition, inasmuch as nearly everything that a first-class restau
rant requires can be supplied from our store. This means that on
account of the very lew prices at which we will be able to charge
the restaurant for its supplies, the restaurant will be able to give
more and a better service for the money than any other restaurant
in St. Louis. The man to be in charge of Luyties' Lunchery is a
popular and experienced restaurant man. and taking all of these
things in consideration yon can easily guarantee yourself yonr mon
ey's worth when yon patronize Lnvties' Lunchery. Thanking yon in
advance for yonr anticipated patronage, we are,
Yours truly,

Washington. Dec. .-An ugly fight is

the District of South Carolina.
At the time of Collector Koester". ap
pointment It was charged that he was an
active participant in a lynching bee in
South Carolina, and Koester not only ad
mitted taking part In the affair, but ac
knowledged writing a long account of the
occurrence for a newspaper he then repre
sented. All the circumstances were fully
explained to President Roosevelt, and the
latter, after hearing both sides of the "ton-,
selected Koester for the office, which he Is
now tilling.
Collector Koester"s appointment, when
made, was the political sensation cf the
hour, and all or. the harrowing details or
his connection with the lynching and his
personal explanations to President Roose
velt were published.
Tlie Republican organization In South
Carolina having been practically Ignored by
President Roosevelt, the whole Aoestcr mat
ter is to be revived and thrashed over in
tho Senate if State Chairman Deas and
