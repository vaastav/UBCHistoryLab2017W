Riley Casner Dead.
Mr. Ca-mer passed away at the
home of Henry Lee in the Verde

the territory for their approval at
an election in which the sole issue
shall be the merits of the proposed
constitution, and if the constitution
is defeated by popular vote, means
shall be provided in the enabling
act for a new convention nnd the
drafting of a new constitution. I
think it vital that the issue as to
the merits of the constitution
should not be mixed up with the
selection of stnte officers and that
no election of state officers should
be had until after the constitution
has ben fully approved and finally
settled upon."
"BUFFALO" JONES READY
Given Farewell Banquet on Eve of De
parture to Manhandle African
Wild Animal.
"Buffalo" Jones, who is known
throughout the country as the man
to whom most credit belongs for
preventing the total extinction of
the buffalo, has arrived in New
York preparatory to sailing for Af-
with a lariat as it is to rope a Tex
as steer. This opinion is shared by
"Mike" Loveless of Capitan, N.
M., and "Jim" Owens of Fredona,
Ariz., two of the best ropers in the
west, whom Mr. Jones has selected
to accompany him on the trip and
to share in the profits that he ex
pects to reap when he returns with
a shipload of wild animals that
have fallen victims to his prowess
with the lasso.
As a fitting farewell on the eve
of his departure, Mr. Jones is to
be tendered a banquet at Dolmon
ico's tomorrow night, at which the
menu will include buffalo steak,
bear meat and other delicacies that
are supposed to tickle the palate of
the western ranchman and hunter.
Numbered among the hosts at the
dinner will be "Buffalo Bill".

BOLD WORK OF THIEVES
Footouds Attempt to Hold up AIrn. C.
C. Hutchinson in Phoenix She Re
sisted and Routed Them.
While Mrs. C. C. Hutchinson of
630 north First avenue was walking
on Bennett lane, near Center street,
Saturday night about 6:30 o'clock
she was attacked by two men who
attempted to snatch her pocket
book. One of the men struck her
n smart blow on the wrist and
grabbed the hand bag tearing away
the handle. Mrs.jHutchinson clung
to the pocketbook and screamed and
the men ran down the street. Mrs.
Hutchinson had been to the Hotel
Adams and was returning to her
home. The hour was early and she
had no fear of going home unac
companied. From Center street
she turned.into Bennett Lane nnd
was about half way down the block
when the two men stole up behind
her. They must have walked very
softly as she did not hear them.
They sprang at her without warn
ing of any sort. One man attempt
ed to hold her while the other
snatched the pocketbook. Mrs.
Hutchinson resisted strenuously nnd
screamed for assistance, and the
men gave up the attempt after
tearing the handba,? almost out of
her hands. They ran down the
street as fast as they could go.
Mrs. Hutchinson then went to the
residence of H. J. McCJiung nearby
and gave the alarm. The police
were notified and a general round
up of the, crooks of the city will
doubtless result. Phoenix Repub
lican. How to Avoid a "Can whang."
About eight hundred or less,
probably twenty-seven by actual
count of faces, young gentlemen in
the 'teen years or less, all of whom
have some claim on Mr. T. E. Pol
lock, called en masse Tuesday night
and were "gorged" on oysters un
til their capacity was plum inca
pacitated. They were a happy
bunch with content smeared all
over their faces when they couldn't
"oyst" another oyster. This lit
tle gobble feast was merely an in
dication on Mr. Pollock's part that
he much preferred hearing the
noise they made with knives and
forks nnd spoons than the melodi
ous "canwhanging" which usually
follows a wedding.
Grand Ganyon Train Ditched.
The pnsspnger train which left
Williams Friday morning, bound
for the Canyon, went in the ditch
near Willaha station about thirty
miles out of this city.'
The engine and four enrs with it
were in the ditch, delaying the
traffic for many hours. A wreck
ing train from this city was sent to
clear the track.
None of the passengers or the
train crew were injured. ' Spread
ing of the rails is the supposed
cause of the wreck. Williams

Lively Little Fire.
A lievly little fire started Mon
dny morning at about 9 o'clock in
one of the portnble houses used by
the Forest Service for the storage
of pine seeds, on the lots adjoining
Supervisor Pooler's residence.
There was not much in the shack
except about 15,000 pounds of pine
seed, which had been collected at a
considerable cost to the govern
ment. The fire was extinguished
before much damage was done. It
originated from a cloth getting too
close to the heating stove.

"The faults of our brethren we
write upon the sand, their virtues
upon the tablets of love and mem
ory," is the motto of all true Elks,

throughout the United States in
which to turn aside from worldly
things for a brief hour and recall

Shooting Scrape at Williams.
A Mexican whose name we were
unable to learn, was brought in
from Williams Wednesday morning
seriously if not fatally wounded.
During the night previous he en
gaged in a cutting and shooting
affray with another Mexican in a
saloon. It is understood that the
dispute arose over a woman. He
was wouded twice, one bullet struck
him in the breast and went through
his body, the other inflicted a flesh
wound in the side. A large bloody
knife was found near him when he
was picked up and it is thought he
had slashed his advisary before be
ing shot. The latter made his es
cape and had not been found up to
yesterday, but officers are confident
they will find him in Williams hid
ing out as it was practically im
possible for him to get away.
Both men were working at the
sawmill in Williams.
Cutting Affair at Ash Fork.
William Thiess, Emigration In
spector stationed at Ash Fork, was
severely cut about the face Tues
day, while attempting to arrest a
negro and had to go to Prescott to
get surgical attention. The negro
had raised an order for 38 cents to
$9.38. Atfer the affair the negro
hit the high spots and has not been
seen since.
Theiss had been asked by Charles
Mainz, deputy sheriff and Santa Fe
special officer to make the arrest if
he happened to see the negro.
The affair took place in front of
the Harvey House.

a fine voice and exceptional must-'
cal ability. Mrs. George Colton
was the accompanist.
Mr. H. H. Linney one of the
bright young legal lights of Prea.
cott, was introduced as the speaker
of the day. Mr. Linney has marked
oratorical ability and in a clear en
tertaining manner spoke of the
deeper thingsof life; the years of
regrets that follow the thoughtless
actions of those who in the full
vigor of life neglect golden oppor
tunities to have their names writ- -ten
high upon the scroll in sacred
memory of he who loves his fellow
men.
Maurice Blomc. with his rich
mellow voice sang "Come Jesus Re
deemer" accompanied by Miss
Glidden.

by more excellent music by Mr. R.
H. Flemming, Mr. Cbaa, A. Palmer
and Mies Julia Manniag;

the audience with the beaedition.
Dr. E. S. Miller, chairman of the
committee on memorial service and
secretary of the lodge, is entitled
to the greater part of the credit for
the success of the memorial service.
Splendid Home Nearly Completed
The Pollock home has been re
modeled and the interior redecorat
ed during the past month. The

woodwork, tiling and decorations
complete as splendid an interior as
can be found in any home in the

geles and Fred Hensing of Flagstaff
were responsible for the woodwork;
Horace Wilson of Los Angeles a til
ing expert handled the mason work
and Wm. Wheaton, artist and dec
orator is in charge of the finishing.
The interior will soon be completed
and will stand comparison with any
thing of its kind in any city.

The largest passenger engine in
the world went through Flagstaff
Wednesday about 11 o'clock at
tached to a special train filled with'
officer of the road. The engine
was a monster, 105 feet in length

three miles of feight cars up hill.

gollon mountains and in the Verde
Valley. Archie Grant, the contrac
