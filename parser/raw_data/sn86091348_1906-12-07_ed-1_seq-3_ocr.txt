When 1 began taking Dr. Williama'
fink Pills," say Mm. Nathaniel Field,
of St. Albans, Somerset county, Maine,
I was the palest, most bloodless person
you oouid imagine.. My tongue and
gums were colorless and my fingers and
ears were like wax. I had two doctors
and they pronounced my trouble anaemia
Ihad spells of vomiting, could not eat,
in fact, did not dare to, I had such dis
tressafteJ eating. My stomach was filled
With gas which caused me awf nl agony.
The backache I suffered Was at times
almost Unbearable and the least exertion
tnade my heart beat so fast that I could
hardly breathe. But the worst of all was
thn unlittina neUraliria headache Which
never left me for seven weeks. About this-
time I had hud several nonib spells. My
limbs Would be cold and without any
feeling and the moot deathly sensations
Would come over me.
'Nothing had helped menntill began
taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, in tact,
. 1 had grown worse every day.i After I
had taken the pills a abort time I could
" sea that thev were benefiting me and
i' one morning I awoke entirely firee from J
pain. The distress after eating ttisap
' peared and In three) weeks I could eat
anything I wanted and suffer no incon
venience. I also slept soundly. I have
taken several boxes of the pills and have
' gained in weight from 120 to 154 pounds
and am perfectly well now."
DrWilliains' Pink Pills cure anaemia
because they actually make new blood.
For rheumatism, indigestion, nervous
headaches and many forms of v akuess
they are recommended even if ordinary
medicines have failed. They are sold by
all druggists, or will be sent postpaid, on
. receipt of price, 50 cents per box, six
boxes for $3.50, by the Dr. Williams

Washington. The passage of the
appropriation bills and as little other
general -legislation as possible. Such
in brief is the forecast for the short
Session of the Fifty-ninth congress,
which began at high noon Monday.
There has not yet been time for as
general an exchange of views among
taembera aa Is ordinarily desired by
leaders before expressing their views,
leaders before expressing their
Views, but all seems to regard tha
present sltuaton aa so simple aa to
need comparatively little intercourse to
arrive at an understanding". It Is evi
dent for Various reasons that It will not
be possible to do much on the appro
priation bill before the holidays, and
the circumstance may have the effect
Of condensing the consideration of
the fourteen large supply measure's
Into two months. Considering that
the aggregate of the appropriations to
be considered will approximate one
billion dollars, some senators and mem
bers express the opinion that congress
fcannot do better than -give -all of Its
time to these, meaeiif esV ' ' " '
i The1 report o the. ship subsidy bill
probably will bp an exception to the
rule, for no general legislation: ;The
friends of that "measure have never
been more insistent than'now; They
are extremely hopeful and yet, very
apprehensive.

In a guide to etiquette published
early in the last century the writer
says that "soap does hot irritate the
complexion; some of the finest com
plexions we have known. rhave been
regularly washed with soap every day."
The same authority remarks that "the
daily bath is now the rule rather than
the exception, and common sense has
triumphed over the decision that wash
ing was injurious." And then the
writer has a dig a: her great-grandmother,
"whose only ablutions con
sisted tn wetting her cheeks with a
cambric handkerchief dipped in rose
water." "In all our directions with re
