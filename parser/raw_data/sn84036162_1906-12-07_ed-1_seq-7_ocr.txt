ON ROOSEVELT'S MESSAGE.
,Prevailing Tone of Comment in Lon.
don Papers Is Favorable.
London, Dec. 6.-President Roose
velt's message to the American con
gress occupies the most prominent
place in the leading newspapers and
has attracted widespread attention
from government officials, diplomats
and the public. The prevailing tone
of the comment is favorable, partic
ularly with reference to the president's
statements on the Japanese question,
the newspapers emphasizing the presi
dent's warning of a possible use of the
federal forces for the protection of
Japanese. This feature of the message
has given especial satisfaction in offi
clal Japanese quarters, where it is
pointed out that Japan is satisfied to
await the outcome of the issue be

ties.
The Daily Telegraph says the presi
dent speaks out resolutely and fear.
lessly, knowing that the Democracy
likes a man who is not afraid to be its
master.
