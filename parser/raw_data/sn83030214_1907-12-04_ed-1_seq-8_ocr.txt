MAROONED BY VITRIOL.
Croxcdcd Car Scatter* Acid Injur
ing Truck Driver and Horse.
Crowded with passengers, a southbond
Eighth avenue car crashed into a heavy truck
loaded with blue vitrol. at 123 d street, shortly
after 11 o'clock last night, severely injuring th<*
driver, marooning the passengers- in a sea of
powerful acid and burning a horse of the team
so badly that it will probably have to be shot.
The truck was going e.ist In 123 d street. The
slippery pavement caused it to stop directly Jn
front of the car. which was going downtown at
a rapid rate loaded with peoplo from the thea
tres. John McCann, the motorman, applied the
brakes, but the car slid along the sleet covered
rails and hit the truck amidships.
The heavy metal ca*:ks were thrown trr the
ground and burst. The powerful acid spread all
over the pavement. Frank Bennett, the driver.
was hurled twenty feet, and received internal
injuries and a fractured ankle. The horse was
tangled in the harness and unab!« to 'get up.
and the bystanders were unable to help him
because of the acid.
One of the men passengers on the car realized
the danger, and with The conductor prevented
the panlcstricken passengers from leaving the
car. When the police of the West l'-Tith street
station arrived the imprisoned passengers were
removed to safety. Bennett was attended by
Dr. Ross, of the Harlem Hospital. The horse
was taken to a nearby veterinary.
JEWS IX THE SCHOOLS.
Columbia Professor Favors Ban on
Christian Ceremonies.
After talking for an hour en "The Jews In Amer
ica" before the People's Institute, in Cooper Union,
last nipht. Professor Franklin H. Giddings, of
Columbia University, was plied with questions f<.r
nother hour by an audience largely composed of
Jews.
•Is the Jew justified in his position in tlie move
ment to keep out Christian ceremonies from the
pabttc schools?" he was asked. Professor Giddings
answered:
i vnainly. Any movement Is justified in the United
States The Question involves two queries: 1 -irs..
whether it Is right and expedient that a niovem<*iit
aeainst Christmas festivities in the public schools
should b<' pushed forward, and second, what my
altitude personally Is. If we can't have free-speech
;m<l if a group of men cannot K-t together to aßi
tate a dfslred end. we have not yet achieved Ameri
can civilization, and we. had better keep on trying.
Tn the other place. I do not see how any on.- can
subscribe to th<: doctrine that It is right to tax one
group of citizens for a general purpose, and compel
them uiidt-r the Uiw to BUtnnlt to things thai are
<on*rarv*to thHr ronscienop. I believe In universal
Mtwrtv *an<l we ought to ha.vo exercises that ar- ac
rpptabl*; to all common sense men and l>> no other*.
I think that the movement Is right and prop.-,
and Its success will depend upon the prood Judgment
temperate tone and patience with which it is carrie-l
on. If Ii Is carried on properly it will be a loceHß,
In answer to Other questions Professor Giddings
said that be did not' think tho Zionist movement
would prevail, for the reason that tho attraction
and opportunities offered by other countries were
far greater than would bo offered the Jew in a
land of his own. „ . ,
"The Jew has come to America to stay, said.
Professor Giddingx. "and he will have all tho kinds
of liberty h- wants if he makes known his wants
to the American people. Whatever else may come
to pass we shall certainly have Kttgtoua liberty In
this country."

FRANK WAYLAND PALMER DEAP
Former Public Printer Was Summarily Dis- j
missed by President Roosevelt.
Chicago. Dec 3.— Frank Wnyland Palmer, for- !
mer Public Printer at Washington, died from
pneumonia liore to-<lay, aged eighty years.
Frank Wayland Palmer was born In Manches
ter. 1n.1.. op October 11, 1527. the youngest of the
v. •!■ children of the H. v. Z. M Palmer, a Bap
tist minister. Shortly afterward his father ac
cepted a call to JamesUMrn. X. V . where the son
attended school. At the age of fourteen he entered
the office of "The Jamestown Journal" as an ap
prentlce. While learning liis tra.lt: he kept ap his
studies at the Jamestown Academy, working in
the printing office nights and mornings. On be
coming a journeyman ho worked at the cast in
Buffalo for a year or bo. and then returned to
Jamestown to tako charge «f "The Journal" for
hia old employer, becoming editor and part owner
In IS4\ when he was twenty-one years old. In
ISoS he went to Dubuqu . lowa, to take a proprie
tary and editorial Interest In "The Times/" of thut
place Three years later ho remov< d to 1> ■
I Moinea. purchasing "The Weekly Register." which
| became -The Dally Register^ under his manage
nicr.t. He was chosen Stata Printer, and served
; four successive terms of two years each.
On receivi.-g an election to Congress in 1868. he
disposed of hU interest in "The Register," and or.
the expiration of his term was re-elected. In the
House of Representatives he was a member of
the Appropriations and other Important commit
tees At the close of his second term he pur
chased a third interest in -The Chicago Inter-
Ocean" and became its editor-in-chief, retiring. on
receiving the ointment as postmaster of Chi
cago In 1577.
He held this office for eight years, until his re
! moval by President Cleveland, in *bs- r .. He then
returned to newspaper work, becoming the editor
of "The Industrial World."
He was appointed Public Printer by President
Harrison, in UM. and served throughout that ad
ministration. President McJdnley r*appotated him
to the same offlce in 1897. and Mr. Palmer continued
to hold on through sldent Roosevelt's admin
istration until Septembe' 8. l«6 when the Presi
dent summarily dismissed him.
This action of the President was due primarily
to the fact that Mr. Palmer bad tritd to force
Oscar J. Ricketta, foreman of printing, and 1.. C.
Hay a foreman of divisi w. out of the Government
Printing Ofllce because they had given evidence
displeasing to him before the Keep Investigating
Commission. The President, on receiving tha
charges against the two foremen, ordered Mr.
Palmer to take no further action in -he affair, and
Issued an order for the dismissal of the Public
Printer himself, to take effect on Beptembei 15.
Mr. Palmer BtUl continuing bis efforts to oust
ht's two subordinates, the President took prompt
action and dismissed him forthwith. Th« lnv«rtl
gation of the Keep Commission had disci la.
serious condition of affairs in the management of
the office. Much of tv evidence tending to dis
credit the administration of Mr. Palmer w;us given
by the two foremen whom he sought to remove.
