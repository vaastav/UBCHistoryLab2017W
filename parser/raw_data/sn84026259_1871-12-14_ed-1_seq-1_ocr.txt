FKANCK AND OIKMANV.
The resumption of diplomatic relations between
Fiance auu Germany have enabled me to give di
rections lor the wiilidruw.il ol the protection ex
tended to Germans in France by ihe diplomatic
and consular lepreicutatlves of the United Slates
iu that country. It Is Just to add thai tne delicate
duty of this protection lias been perlurmed by the
Mini-tier aud Consul-Ueueral at Pails aud the vail
ous consuls In France under the supervision of the
latter, with great kluduess as weil as with pru
dence aud ucc. Their course has received the
commendation of the German government, aud
has wounded no susceptibility of the French.
The government 01 the Kmperor of German
continues to manifest a friendly feeling toward
the Untied States, and a desire 10 harmonize with
ttie moderate and just policy which this govern
ment maintaius In lis lelatiou with Asiatic pow
ers, as well as with the South American republic
1 hare given assurance that the friendly feelings
or that government are fully shared by the Culled
States. Iheratidcations of the Consul and Natural
Ixailuu convenuuus wan the Ausiro Hungarian
Kinplie have been exchanged.
ITALY AND KOMI.
I have been officially Informed of the nn nexatlon
or ihe States of the Church to the Kingdom 01
Italy, ami the removal of ihe capital of that king
dom to Koine, lu conformity with ihe established
policy of the United Stales 1 have recognized this
chunge.
The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce
between the Untied Stale and Italy have been
exchanged. The two powers have agreed in tins
treaty mat private property at sea man oe exempt

ty of incorporating this rule Into the obligation of
nations.

RUSSIA.
The Intimate friendly relations which have so
loug existed bclweeu the United Slates and Rus
sia contluue undisturbed. The visit of the third
son of the Emperor I a proof that there la no Ue
siie ou the part or his government to diminish
the c-irdlulity of those relations. The hospitable
reception which has beeu given to the Grand
Puke is a proof that on our able we share Ihe
wisie of that government. The Inexcusable
course or the Russian Minister at Washington
rendered It necessary to ask bis recall and to de

diplomatic representative. It was- Impossible,

personal abuse of government oitlclals, anil during
his persistent Interference, through various means,
with the Malum between the Untied Slates and
oihir power. In accordance with my wishes,
tbt g vsrntnent has been relieved of further In
tercourse with Mr. Catacazy, and the manage
ment of the affairs of the Imperial legation has
passetl Into the hand of a gentleman entirely
unobjectionable.
CHINA AND JAPAN
With Japan we continue 10 maintain intimate
relations. The Cabinet of the Mikado baa since
the close of the last session of Congress selected
citizens of the United States to serve tn oince of
Importance in several department or government.
I have reason to think that this selection la due to
an appreciation of the disinterestedness or the
policy which, the lulled States have pursued
towards Japan. It 1 very desirable to maintain
this disinterested aud Just po.lcy with China as
well as Japan. The correspondence transmuted
herewith shows that there la no disposition on Ihe
part or this government to swerve from lis eotab
luttied coarse. Prompted by a desire to pat aa
nd toth. barbarous treatment of our shipwrecked
sailors an lb. Cureaa coast, 1 instructed our Minis
ter at Pekln to endeavor to conclude a convention
witn Cores for securina the saletv and hnmane
treatment or such marine's. Admiral dodgers
was iiiiuruciei to accompany mm, wttn a suf
ficient lore to protect nlin In case of need. A
small surveying party sent out on reaching the
coast was treacneruusiy attacked at a disadvan
tage. Ample opportunity was given ror explana
tion and apology; neither came. A force was
then landed, ami after an arduous march over a
rugged auu funiculi country, the ions irom which
the outrages had been committed were reduced
by a gallant assault, and were destroyed. Having
thus punished the criminals, and having vindica
ted the honor or Ihe flag, the expedition returned,
flndfu It Impracticable, under Ihe circumstauces.
to conclude the desired convention. I respectfully
reier to tne correspunae ce relating tnereto here
with submitted and leave the subject, for such ac
tlon as Congress may see dt to take,
MEXICO.
The Republic of Mexico has not yet repealed the
very oujecuouaoie laws estautisning wnai Is known
as the Free Zoue on the frontier or the United
states, it is hoped that this may yet be done, and
also that more stringent measures may be taken
by that republic for restraining lawless persons on
its frontiers. 1 hope Mexico, by lis own action,
will soon relieve this government of the dtllicul-
tie experienced from these causes. Our relations
with the various republic or Central and South
America continue, with one exception, to be
cordial and friendly. 1 recommend some action
by Congress regarding the overdue installments
under the Vemzuela claims commission of 1866.
The eternal dissensions of this government pre
sent no Justldcaituu for Ihe absence or effort to
meet tnelr solemn treaty obligations.
C IS'TRAL AND BOCTU AMERICA.
The ratification of the Extradition Treaty with
Nicaragua has been exchanged.
it is a subject for congratulation that the great
emperor oi Brazil uas taken the minatory step
towards the abolition of slavery. Our relations
Willi that empire, always cordial, will naturally be
uiRue more so oy tins ucu it n nut too much to
hope thai the government or BrazilTnay hereafter
hnd It for Its Interest, as well asiutrinsically right
to advance towarda entire emancipation inure
rapidly than the present act contemplates.
The true prosperity and sreatnese of a nation
are to be round in the eievatiou an l education or
lis laborers. It is a subject for regret that there
forms in this direction which were voluntarily
promised by the statesmen or Spain have not been
carried out In Its Weal India colonies. The laws
and regulations for the apparent abolition 01
slavery in Cuba and Porto Kico leave most of the
lauorera In boudage, with no hope or release until
their lives become a burden to their employers.
1 desire to direct your attention to the facl that
the citizens of the United States, or persons claim
ing to be fttizens or the United States, are large
1. outers in foreign lands bf this species of properly
forbidden by the fundamental law of their alleged
country. I recommend to Congress 10 provide, bj
stringent legislation, a suitable remedy against
the holding, owning or dealing In slaves, or belug
interested in slave property lu foreign lauds, timer
as owners, hirers or moitgagers, bj citizens of Ihe
United States.
TUB STRUOOLE IN Ct'BA.
It Is to be regretted that the disturbed condition
or the Island or Cuba counnues to be a source o
aunojaiice and or anxiety. The existence of a
protracted struggle In such close proximity to our
own territory, without apparent piuspect of an
early termination, cannot ue other than au object
of concern to a people, who, while abstaining from
luterlereuce ill ihe affairs of other powers, natu
rally desire to see every country in the undisturb
ed enjoyment or peace, liberty, and tne hlesslng.
or free institutions. Our naval commauders lu
Cuban water have been Instructed, lu case li
should become necessary, to spare no edort to
urulect the lives aud property of bonalde Ameri
can citizens, aud to maintain the diguity of the
Bag.
lils hoped that all pending questions with Spain,
growing out 01 the affair lu Cuba, may be adjust
ed In tne spirit or petce and conciliation, which
haa Hitherto guided the two powers lu their treat
ment oi each questions.
INTKHCOCKSE WITH TUB BAST.
To give Importance and to add to the efllclenci
or our diplomatic relations wiih Japan ami China
and to lunner aid in retaining the good opinion ol
those peo, les, and to secure to tne United Male
us shai e of the commerce destined to Dow between
those nation and the balance of the commercial
world, 1 earuestly recommend that an uppropria
lluu be inude to support at least four American
louthsiu eich of those countries to serve as nan
ul iheoiuclal families of our miulsters there. Oui
representatives would not evvu then be placed
upon an euuuiily with the representative ol Great
Hritatti and or some other powers. As now situ
aied, our representatives lu Japan and Ctuna have
10 uepeuu for Interpreters and translators upon
natives or those countries who know our language
I'Mperfectly, or procuie lor the occasion llm ser
vices of employees iu foreign business houses, 01
the Interpreters to other forelgu ministers. 1

purpose 01 fnsterlug the American hue ol steamers
now plying between tan Fiauclsco and Japan and
China, anu the Australian Hue, almost our only re
maining Hues 01 ocean steamers, and of increasing
their services.
TIIB NATIONAL DEBT.
The national debt bus been reduced to the ex
tenter eighty six millions, flftj -seven thousand,
one h una red and twenty-six dollars aud elkhij
cents during the year; aud uy the negotiations

account is nearly seventeen million dollars les-
lliau on the nret or March, 1809. H was highly de
sirable that 1 his rapid diminution should take
place, 001 11 to strengthen the credit 01 ine country

For the oneratlons of Ihe army In the past year.

tha ensuing year aud lor continuing sea-coast aud
oilier Improvement conducted uuder the super
vision of ihe war Department, 1 reier you 10 tne
acoompauylng leport of the Secretary 01 War.
I call tour attention to ihe provisions oi the acl
or Congress approved March a. 1'6. which discon
tinues promotions iu tne sum vorpa-ui iue army
until provided for by law. 1 recommend that tin
number of orllcera In each giade of the staff corps
be dxed. and that wheuever tn cumber in auj
one grade falls below the number so dxed, the va
cancy may b fllled by promotion from the grade
below. J also recommend that when theolUoe 01
chief or a corps become vacant the place may be
Oiled by selection from the corps la which the va
cancy exlsia.
The reoort or tha secretary 01 ine avy snows
an Improvement id the number and etllctency 01
the naval forces, without material Increase in the
expeuae of supporting It. This Is due to the policy
wuicu Baa been adopted, and is veing exienuea as
I at as our malarial will admit, or using smallei
vessel a cruisers on tut several station. By
this meani wa have beam enabled to occupy ai
one larger sxtent of crulainf frousd, to visit
more frequently the posts where the presence of
our Sag is desirable, and generally to discharge
mure efficiently the appropriate duties ol the navy
lu time ol peace, without exceeding the number of
men or the expenditures authorized by law. (lur
ing the past year the navy has, In addition to Its
regular service, supplied the u,en and otneers for
the vessels of the coast surveys, and has compiet
ed the surveys, authorized by Congress, 01 tha
Isthmus of Darlen, and Tehuantepec, and under
dkeauthoitty ha sent out an expedition, com
pletely furn. sheil and eqlpped. to explore tha un
known ocean of the north.
The suggest Ions of the report as to the necessity
for Increasing and approving the materiel of the
navy, and the plan recommended ror reducing the
personnel of ttie service to a peace siandnm by ihe
gradual abolition of certain pradesor officers, the
reduction or others, aud the employment or some
In the service or the commercial marine, are well
considered and deserve ihe thoughtful attention
or Congress. I also lecommend that all promo
tions in the navy above the rank or captain be by
selection Instead ol by seniority; this course will
secure In tne higher grades greater efficiency and
hold ont an Incentive to young officers to Improve
themselves In the knowledge or their profession.
The present cost or maintaining the navy, lu cost
compared with that or the preceetllng year and the
estimate for the ensuing year, are contained In
the accompany rtport of ihe secretary of ineNavy.
- ' POST-OFFICE pKFARTMENT.
The enlarged receipts of the Postofflce Depart
ment, as shown by the accompanying report or
Ihe Postmaster-General, exhibit a gratifying in
crease In that branch of tne public service. It Is
the Index of the growth of education and of the.
prosperity or the people, two elements highly con
ducive to the vigor and atabhlltr or republics
with a vast territory like ours, much or It sparsely
populated, but all requiring the services of the
mall. It is not at present to be expected that the
department can be made self-sustaining, but a
gradual approach to this end from year to year is
conddently relied on, and the day Is not fur dis
tant when the PostoHlce Department or the gov
ernment will prove a much greater blessing to the
whole people than It Is now. The suggestion of
the Postmaster-General for Improvements In the
department presided over by nlm, are eamestly
recommended to jour special attention: espec ally
do 1 recommend favorable consideration of the
plan of uniting the telegraph system or ihe United
Mates with the postal system. It is believed that
by such a course ti:e cost or telegraphing could be
much reduced, and the service as weil, If not bet
ter rendered. It would secure the further advan
tage or extending tne telegraph through portions
01 the country wi. era private enternrise will not
construct It. Commerce, trade, and above all the
efforts to bring a people widely separated Into
commnnity of interest, are always benenited by a
rapid intercommunication. Education, the ground
work or republican Institutions. Is encouraged by
the Increasing facilities to gather speedy news
from all pans of the country. The desire to reap
the tieneut or such Improvements will stimulate
education. I refer to the report of the Postmaster
General for full details or the operations or last
year, and for comparative statements of results
with former years.
KlT-ELl-X LAW.
There has been Imposed npon the executive
branch or the government the execution of the act
of Congress approved April vo, 1871, and common
ly kuuwnaa the Ku-Klux law, in a portiou ol the
state or South Carolina. The necessity or the
course pursued will he iiemonstiated by the re
port ol the Committee to Investigate Southern
outrages. Under the provisions ol the above
act, I issued a proclamation calling the attention
01 the people or ihe Uulted States to same and de
claring my reluctance 10 exercise any of the extra
ordinary powers thereby conferred upon me, ex
cept Incase of imperative neci sslty, bat making
known my purpose to exercise such poweis
wheuever It should become necessary to do so for
the purpose or securlug to all citizen- or the
United states the pe.toclui enjoy mentor the rights
guarantied to theiu by the Constitution a. d the
laws. After the passage of this law In'ormation
was recetvid from time 10 time that combinations
uf the character rercrred to in this law existed,
and were puwerhil lu many parts or the Southern
liat.-s, particularly iu certain counties in the state
or South Caronua. Carelul investigation wus
made, and it was ascertained ttiut in nine counties
or that state such combinations wcreaeiive and
powerful, embracing a sultlclent portion of the cit
izens to control the local authority, aud having
among other tilings the object of depriving the
emancipated class or the substantial benehts ol
irec loin, and of preventing the free political action
uf tnese citizens who did not sympathize with their
own views. Among their operations were Ire
quent scourglngs aud occasional assassinations,
generally perpeiraied at nighi, by disguised per
sons, the victims lu almost all cases, being citizens
or different political seutunenis Irom their own, or
Heed person who had shown a disposition to
claim equal rights with other citizens. Thousands
01 luodeuslve aud weil disposed citizens were the
sufferers by this lawless violence. Thereupou.
on the l'Jlh or October, a proclamation waa Issued
in tiie terms or the law calling npon the members
of those combinations to disperse within five days,
and to deliver to ibe marshal or military officers of
the L ulled States all arms, ammunition, uniforms,
disguises, and other meuus aud Implemeuts used
by them for carrying out their unlawrul purposes.
This warning not having been heeded, on the
17th of October, another proclamation was Issued
suspending the privilege of the writ of luibrai
cor pits in nine counties In that State. Dlnction
wa given that, within the counties so deslguafd,
persuus supposed, upon creditable Information, to
be members or such unlawful combinations shoul 1
ue arrested by the military forces or the Uuited
t ites and delivered to the marshal to be dealt
with according to law. Iu two or said counties
t ork and Spartanburg many anesis have been
made. At the lust account tue uuiuber or persona
thus arrested was one hundred ami sixty eight.
Several hundred 1 whose criminality was ascer
tained to be or an Inferior degree were released
for the present. These have generally made con
fessions of their guilt. Great caution has been ex
ercised In making Ihese arrests, and notwithstand
ing tha large number, It la belle ted that no Inno
cent person Is now In custody. The prisoners will
be held for regular trial in the judicial trinnnals of
the United States, as soon a It appeared that
the authorities of the United States were about to
lake vigorous measures to enforce the law, many
persons abscoaded, and there is good ground for
supposing ilmt all or such persous have violated
the law. A full report ol what has been done un
der this law will be submitted to Congress by Ihe
Attorney-General.
TOE MORMONS.
In Utah there still remains a remnant of barbar
ism repuguaut to civilizinlou, to decency aud to
the laws of the United State. Territorial officers,
however, have been found who are willing to per
forin their duty in a spirit ut equity, and with a
due seuse of sustaining the majesty of the law.
Neither polygamy, nor auy 01 her violation of exist
ing statutes will be permuted within the territory
01 the Lulled fcuiies. It is uol wiih the religion of
iheseif-eiyled saint that we are now dealiug,
but with their practices. Tbey will be protected
lu the worship of God, according to the nictates of
their conscience; but tbey will nut be permuted to
violate ihe law under the cloak of reiiglou. It
may be advisible for Congress to consider what In
the execution or the law against polygamy, 1 to
tie the statua or plural wives aud their offspring.
The propriety of Congress passing an enabling act
authorizing the territorial legl.ii.iure of Utah to
legitimize ail children born prior to a lime fixed lu
the aci, might be Justlhed by lis humanity to those
iuuoce.it children. This is a suggestion only, and
uol a recommeudatlon.
TUB INDIANS.
The policy pursued towarda ibe Indians has re
sulted favorably, so far aa can be Judged from the
limited time during winch 11 has been lu opera
tion. Through the exertions ol Ihe various socie
ties I'fChrlauaua 10 whom haa been entrusted ibe
execution ol the pulley, aud Ihe board or Commis
sioners authorized by the law or April 10, laeu,
many trioes or ludiaus have beeu Induced to set
tle upou reservations to cvltivale the soil, to per
form productive labor or various kinds and to par
tUlly accept civilization. They are cared lor lu
-uch a way, It la hoped, as to Induce those who
are still pursuing their old habit or life to embrace
the only opportunity which 1 lelt them to avoid
ex ermluaiion. 1 recommend liberal appropria
tion to carry out the iudian peace pulley, uol
only because it 1 humane. Uhriatiaulike auu ecou
oiukal, but because it ut light.
1 recommend to your favorable consideration
the policy of also grautlng a territorial govern
ment to the Indians in the Tndiau Territory, weal
of Arkansas and Missouri aud south of Kansas,
lu doing so, every rlglu guarantied to the Indians
uy treaty should be secured. Such a course might
iu tlm be the meaus of collecting moat of the lu

rvBi.10 LANDS.
J renew my recommendation that the public
lands be regarded as a heritage to our children, to
im disposed of only a required for occupation and
10 actual aettier. Those already granted have
ben lu great part disposed of lu such a way aa to
secure access to the balauc by the hardy settler
who may wish to avail hlmseii of them. But cau
tion should be exerclaed eveu in attaining so de
sirable au objevt. Educational interest may well
be served by ibe grant ol proceeds ol sale or pub
lic lands to settler. I do not wish to be under
stood a recommending, lu the Least degree, a cur
lalluieut of what la being done by the general
government (ur ihe encouragement ol education.
Tne report of Ibe Secretary of the Interior, sub
mitted with this, will give yon all the Information
collected and prepared for publication in legard to
the censns taken ounng Ihe year iBTO; Ihe opera
tions of the Bureau of Education for the year, ihe
Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land Office,
and the Indian Bureau.
Ihe report of the Commissioner of Agriculture
gives the operations 01 his department for the
year. As agriculture Is the groundwork or our
prosperity, too much Importance cauuot ne at
tached to the labors of this department. It Is in
the hands of an able head, with able assistants, all
zealously devoted to Introducing Into the agricul
tural productions of Ihe nation ail useful products
sdapted to spy of the various c.ltnsies aud soils of
onr vast terrltorj ; and to giving all useiul Infor
mation as to the method of cultivation or the
plants, cereals and other products adapted to par
ticular localities. Q,muy, but surely, the Agricul
tural Bureau is working a great national good ;
and ir lllH-rally supported, the more widely its In
duence will be extended, and the less dependent
we shall be upon the products or foreign countries.
The subject ot compensation to the heads of bu
r aua auu officials Holding positions ol responsi
bility, and requiring ability and character to fill
them properly, i oue to winch your atteotlon la
invited, nut few or the officials receive compensa
tion equal to the respectable support or a family,
while their duties are stK-h as to Involve millions
or interest. In private hie services demand com

economy would dictate- the same rule In the gov
ernment service.
1 have not given the estimates for the support of
the government for the ensuing year, nor tne com
parative statement between the expenditure for
the year Just passed and the one Just preceding,
'because all these dguies aie contained In the ac

to Congress. These estimate have my approval.
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.
More than six years hare elapsed since the last
hostile gun was fired between the armies then ar
rayed against each other, the one for the perpetua
tion, the other for the destruction or the union. It
may well be considered whether it Is not now
time that Ihe disabilities Imposed by the Four
teenth Amendment should be removed. That
amendment does not exclude the ballot, but only
Imposes the disability to hold office npon certain
clasaea. When the purity ol the ballot is secure,
majorities are sure to elect officers reflecting the
vie w s or the majority. 1 do not see Ihe advantage
or propriety or excluding men from office merely
because they were, before the rebellion, or stand
ing and churacte sufficient to be elected to posi
tions requiring them to take oaths to support the
Constitution, and admitting to eligibility thore en
tertaining precisely the same views but or leas
standing in their communities. It may be said
that the former violated an oath while the iatier
did not. The latter did not have It In their power
to do so. ir ihey had taken this oath it cannot be
doubted they would have broken It, as did the for

In opposition to the government, they might, In
the Judgment of Congress, be excluded from such

CIVIL 8ERYICB REFORM.
It has been the aim of the Administration to en
force honesty aud efficiency lu all public offices.
Every public servant who ha violated the trust
pluced In him has been proceeded against with ah
ihe vigor of the law. If bad men have secured
f daces It has been the fault ol the system estab
isiied by law and custom for making appoint
ments, or the fault of those who recommended for
government position persons not sufficiently well
kuowu to them personally, or who give letters en
dorsing the character or office-seekers without a
proper sense of the grave resnousioilltv which
such a course devolves upon them. A civil service
reiorm wiucn can correct this abuse is much de
sired. In mercantile pursuits the business man
who gives a letter of recommendation to a friend
to enable him to obtain credit from a stranger, Is
regurneu as mursiiy responsible lor the integrity
of hlsfnend, and his ability to meet his obligations,
A reformatory law which would enforce Hub prin
ciple agalusi all endorsers or persons for public
piece, wuuiu insure great cautiou in making recom

the careless and the dishonest nuiille servant In

comprise ibe majority or the community in which
they live.
In my message to Congress, one year ago. I ur
gently recommended a reform In the civil service
of the country, lu conformity with the recom

Cornell University.
A STUDENT'S labor for knowledge.
A correspondent of the New York
Timet, recently visiting; the Cornell
TJciveTsity, describes, among other in
teresting particulars, a conversation
held with one of the students. The in
terview gives a good indication of the
qualities of the young man, who is a
sample of a great many, in the Cornell
and other institutions ot learning, wno
are obtaining an eduoation under what
the world would call adverse circum
stances. But although the labor is hard
and the deprivations great, they form
tbe furnace of trial, to refine the in tel
lect, and produca a mental and moral
state of sterling parity and value.
" 1 looked around tor some student
who could inform me as to the progress
made in the specialty of Cornell the
self-supporting part of the system. At
last, by good chance, I came upon a
room where a young fellow of twenty-
three was studying Sanscrit. Having
been in India for many years, I was in
terested in his studios, and we commenced
an animated conversation uoon philo-
loeio roots. We criticised Max Muller,
commented on Bunsen's theory of the
Pelasgio people, and heartily agreed
upon the absurdity of studying Greek
and JUatin, wnion were dried sponges,
out of which everything good had been
taken by our ancestors. Incidentally I
learned that this most accomplished
gentleman was supporting himself by
laboring: on the farm. lie generally
worked three hours a day, and six hours
on Saturdays, and had already got
through his appointed labor for that
Saturday. I asked him if the manual
labor 01 plowing, etc., did not stupefy
him, contract the brain cells, and make
his apprehension duller. replied
that it did not, because he bad been
brought up as a farmer, and had nothing
to learn when he came tc the college.
He was taking tbe agricultural course,
but had become interested in philology,
and one of the professors, who knew
Sanscrit, had become interested in him,
and had given him lesBons in that per
fect language, though Oriental studies
are not in the curriculum.
I said : " I suppose yours is an indi
vidual case 'i"
Student Yes, as regards the philology,
but not for the farm. There are twenty
nine of us who work on it.
Correspondent Does it pay your ex
penses ?
Student It pays mine : but then 1
worked steadily during the long three
months vacation, which ended in Sep
tember. I can go easy now if I feel in
clined. Correspondent I suppose the hardest
part ot the work is done by laborers em
ployed for that purpose r
Student Not at all. There are only
two teamsters hired on the farm, and all
the ether work is done by us. At this
moment we're laying down a series of
drains, and this is very heavy work in
deed.
Correspondent Did you do that this
morning r
Student Yes, for six hours.
Correspondent And did you not feel
stupened or tired out r
Student Not at all. I dislike the
work, and was very glad to get back to
this, but X was not tired.
Correspondent Are there any other
methods of earning one's support here,
besides the farm r
Student Oh yes. If you can print,
you can earn more in the press room
than on the farm, and soon there will
be lots of work in the machine shop,
The men are going to make copies of
univier s geometric models.
Correspondent What's that?
Student Why, a Frenchman of the
name of Ollivier made a set of models to
illustrate all the problems of ceometry.
A set was purchased by the State of
new x ork, and is, I think, at Albany,
They aro coiner to make copies of these,
Twenty thousand dollars were given, I
believe, for the first set that he made,
but our fellows here can make them for
eight hundred.
Correspondent I see. Well, but men
who can t handle tools will not be able
to do that sort of thing.
Student Certaiulv not. Skilled la
bor is at the same premium here that
it is elsewhere.
Correspondent What can the men do
who have only their manual strength
Student Well, they can work" on the
farm or they can grade the square.
Correspondent They cau do that,

Student No j he expected that the
college would give work to every one,
that cared to take it, of a kind that he
could do. I suppose that this will be
done in the future by outsiders, but it
can never be accomplished bv the college.
Correspondent Something in tbe fac
tory way, you mean. I suppose some
thing that will utilize the grand water
power that is running to waste so pic-

Correspondent I beg your pardon
for the seeming impertinence of the
question I am about to ask, and I beg
yon to believe that tha spirit that dic
tates it is not one of mere curiosity. Are
you living in this fashion from necessity,
or do youpirhaps wish to show that it
can be done by those who have no re
sources ?
btudent I do it from necessity; I
am very poor.
Correspondent Sir, from my heart I
honor you, and if the sympathy of a
stranger can lighten a road so stony,
pray understand that you have it in the
fullest sense of of the word.
We shook hands heartily, and I left
him to his Sanscrit, feeling as I walked
away that Cornell meant something
more than showed on the surface. We
Americans have been rather apt to
worship the dollar, but when poverty is
so honorable and so honored as it is
here, our golden idol is like to tumble a
peg or so in the estimation of society."
Indian Karnes.
In some instances it is a spocial matter
of regret that tbe Indian names of places
and States no longer suggest their orig
inal meaning. Xhis was occasionally
simple enough, as in Connecticut orig
iually written Quonaughtitot which
meant in the Mohegan dialeot " long
river ;" and in Massachusetts in the
Natic dialect Masatuset signifying " the
place of great hills,'' with reference to
the Blue Hills, eleven miles to the south
west of Boston, the highest point of land
in the eastern part of that State. Of
eities thus designated itiluavkie recalls
its original name, meaning " rich lands,
and timg Sing, the Algonquin word
A finning, " a place of stones," with all
the greater forces, as it is now " the resi
dence of gentlemen," in Artemus Ward's
language, "who spend their days in
poundin' stun.' Other names, however,
have more or less picturesqueness in their
meaning, and are not so easily improved
by recent changes. Thus Vhieaao repre
sents in its French pronunciation very
fairly tbe actual sounds heard by the
first French explorers, when tbe Potawa-
tomies, who dwelt there, called it Sheeau
go, "playful waters." ('f) Duhlontga is
the softened form of th) Talauneca of the
Cherokees, which meant " yellow metal,"
for the Indians were well aware of the
gold found in the neighborhood, which
made the city in later years the seat of a
Oovernment mint, because of its happy
position in the very centre of the gold
mine district ot .Northern Ueorgia.
Lake Erie is almost the only remainder
now of the once powerful tribe of Erie,
who lived where the Stat 3 of Ohio now
is ; the latter name, as given to the river,
owes its origin to the Iroquois, who
called it the Oheo, " beautiful water," by
tbe same instinctive admiration which
prompted the French to name it La
Belle Riviere. It had a lucky escape
from Father Marquette's baptism, who
christened - it Ouaboukigon a name
which subsequently shrunk into Oua
b.iche, and has finally as Wabash been
given to the last tributary of the Ohio.
It is curious that a kind of stigma seems
to adhere to the name, for even now the
good people of Indiana and the West
generally are fond of saying of a man
who has been cheated, that " he has been
Wabashed." At one time, when the
" dark and bloody ground" of Kentucky
and Ohio became famous among the
whites, the Indians also telt inclined to
call their beautiful river rather the
Blood Biver, so fearful had been the
scenes of carnage and cruelty eaacted on
its fair banks. One of the youngest
Srates, Idaho, well deserves its poetical
name, l-da-hoe, the " gem of the mount
ains," and the name of the river Motion
gahela flows as smoothly from the lips
with its liquid notes as the far-famed
rye whiskey distilled on its banks, which
is known all over the Union by the samo
term, in contra-distinction from Scotch
and Irish rivals. On the other hand,
the much-discussed name of the greatest
waterfall on our continent has been
stripped of all the poetical meanings
given it by writers whose imagination
exceeded their knowledge. Neagara, the
original word, taken from the Seneca
Iroquois dialect, has no connection with
cataracts, but means prosaically, across
tbe neck," alluding to the course of the
river across the neck or strip of land that
lies between Lakes Erie and Ontario. A
similar idea underlies the word Mitchilan
in the Ottawa dialect, which was origin
ally given to Mackinao, and meant
"fences," as if the island were lying
fence-like before the Upper Lake. At
least so says Rev. Mr. Fierz, a missionary
among the Ottawas; but Allouez, bis
French predecessor, calls it, a few years
before, ilachihiganing ; the present word,
Michigan, is evidently an improvement
upon both the former names. American'

A Fight for Life.
The Liberty (111.) Tribune reports the
following :
Near Harlem, in this county, a well
dressed and respectable-looking woman
was walking along near a drove of Tex
as cattle, which were being driven by.
One of the animals, a cow, got separated
from tbe drove and met the woman.
The cow attacked the woman, pushed
her down, and was thrusting her with
her horns, when she was discovered by
Mr. Henry Wilhite, who, seeing the
woman's perilous condition, rushed up
and commenced beating the cow over
tbe head with the butt of his whip.
This only infuriated the cow more, so
that she threw the woman with her
horns into a ravine and followed her
still thrusting, nnmindful of Mr. Wil
hite her antagonist About this time,
Mr. Andrew Foley discovered them and
ran up with a billet of wood, and com
menoed beating the cow with all his
might This had the effect to turn tha
attention of the cow from the woman
to Mr. Foley. She closed in with him
he, being unable to use his stick any
longer, grappled her by the horns. Mr.
Wilhite joined in this death struggle, and
while it was going on managed to get
out his pocket knife and cut the cow's
throat and so the fight ended. Our In
formant says that tha lady, except some
bruises, is comparatively unhurt
