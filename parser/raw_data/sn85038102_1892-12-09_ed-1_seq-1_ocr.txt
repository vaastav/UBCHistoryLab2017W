HARRISON'S MESSAGE
The Prosperity of the Country
is Indeed Glorious.
Still Adheres to the Doctrine of Protec
tion A General Resume of the Presi
dent's Masterly l'aper.
Washington, Dec. 7. The present pros
perity of the country, according to the
president's message, is unequalled, and
census statistics are quoted liberally to
show the growth of business in thirty
years. Tin plate factories now number
thirty-two. Our foreign trade in 1892
showed an Increase of 27 per cent., wholly
due to exports. Everything is better than
ever before, except that wheat and cotton
are low, but discontented farmers should
remember they are better off than the farm
ers of any other country. Protection has
been a mighty instrument in the develop
ment of our wealth and the prevention of
waoA
The result of the recent election must
be accepted as having introduced a new
policy. He assumes that the present
tariff is to be repealed, and that there is
to be substituted for it a tariff law con
structed solely with reference to revenue;
that no duty is to be liiguer because the
increase will keep open au American mill,
or keep up the wtiaes of American work
ingman. The contention has not been between
schedules, but between principles, and it
would be offensive to suggest that the
prevailing party will not carry into legis
lation the principles advocated by it, and
the pledges given to the people. He rec
ommends that the whole subject of tariff
revision be left to the incoming congress,
although regretting that this must delay
the work of revision at least three months.
He is skeptical relative to the future
tinder a changed tariff, and the protec
tionists, with undiminished confidence,
will await results. The benefits of protec
tion to woikingmen have been obscured
by the contests between employers and
employes.
'I he net decrease in revenue during the
year was J.Ii,O0O,O0O, but it is estimated
there will lie a cash balance of J20.000.0HO
in tlut treasury at the and of the tUuul
year. It is impossible.however, to foresee
with certainty whether the revenues will
not be further diminished by the prospect
of tariff changes. He says the surplus is
not in the treasury any more, but in the
pockets of the people, by means of the.
pension legislation and free sugar. He
recommen'ls repeal of sinking fund law,
and withholds any suggestions relative to
silver because the monetary congress is in
session.
We have no more Indian frontiers, and
the policy of concentration should now be
adopted in distributing the army.
lie tninKs some better methods of deal
ing with claims presented to the court of
claims should be adopted, and supports
the postal suosidy idea and urges a con
tinuance .of the present policy. The new
navy is glowingly described. He recom
mends a further encouragement of the
naval militia.
The service at the Indian agencies has
bieu improved. He approves of the
present at! ministration of the pension
bureau, and says there is a pension de
ficiency this year of $10,500,000. If no
further pension legislation is enacted, the
maximum of pension payments will be
reached in two years, and will aggregate
118,000,000 a year.
ljj complements Secretary Rusk on the
enlarged foreign markets for pork and
beef.
Unreasonable and unfriendly objections
from Canada have thwarted our negotia
tions with England relative to the seals,
the fisheries and canal tolls. Canadian
railroadsare sustained by American trade,
and it is estimated that these foreign
transportation lines yearly carry between
different points in the United States
goods to the value of $100,000,000.
We have no disposition to interfere
with the politics of Canada, but we
should put the transportation business
upon a different foundation and build an
American canal around Niagara Falls to
secure our independence of Canadian 1
waterways.
He extends congratulations on the
happy conclusion of Chilian misunder
standing. Believes in promoting a cable
to the Sandwich Islands and says the
government should support the Nicara
gua canal project
The free coinage of silver upon an
agreei international ratio is desirable,
and the business demand is growing for
an enlargement of the world's volume of
coined money.
The work of reciprocity has been well
begun, and under favorable conditions we
hall soon net fully one-third of the Cen
tral and South Atuerican trade; Europe is
already alarmed by the new policy of this
government. -
The twenty-day quarantine will be con
tinued. Epidemics can be avoided, and
immigration suould be restricted.
The liquor traffic in Washington should
be restricted. .
Fatal car couplers are condemned.
He has under consideration a further
extension of the civil service system. He
appeals for a patriotic and non-partisan
consideration of electoral reform and
deprecates southern lawlessness.
He has pointed out our present prosper
ity that we may better note the increase,
or decrease which will ensue from the
new tariff policy, and says "Retrogression
would be a crime."

AN UNBALANCED MIND
Thought to He Responsible for the Dis
appearance of Rev. 8. F. McCleary.
Boston. Dec. 5. Rev. Samuel F. Mc
Cleary, assistant pastor of the First Uni
tarian church of the Saviour in Brooklyn,
and son of ex-City Clerk McCleary of Bos
ton, has been missing since last Thursday
and it is feared that he committed suicide
by jumping from the deck of one of the
sound steamers. Although the police are
still searching for him, a letter received
by his father in this city and dated from
Brooklyn, the day after he left his resi-
dence.satisfles his father that his body now
lies at the bottom of Long Island Sound.
Overwork, causing an unbalanced mind
is ascr ibed by his friends as the cause of
the rash deed.
The missing man was one of the best
known of the clergymen in the City of
Churches, and although only 28 years old,
he early developed unusual talent, and as
sociation with the celebrated Rev. II.
Price Collier brought him into promi
nence and made liim many friends. He

crushed out.

in Pytiiiitn hall, over J. H. Watts' drug
store. The postoilice aqd telephone olliue
were burned out. A message asking lur
assistance from the lire department was
sent to Manchester and Portsmouth, and
both responded, but owing to the headway
which the fire had gained it is doubtful if
much can be saved.
