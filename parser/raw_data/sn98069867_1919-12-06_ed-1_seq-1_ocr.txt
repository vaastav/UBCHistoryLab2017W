INTERVENTION IN MEXICO IMPROBABLE

WILSON HAS LAST
SAY; CAN PREVENT
ARMED INVASION
BY DAVID LAWRENCE
Special ( orrespomlent of The News Scimitar.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.-Thcrc is not going to be any
armed intervention in Mexico at this time.. Congress may pass
resolutions asking for severance of diplomatic relations and even
authorize the use of military and naval forces, but, under the
constitution of the United States, it remains for the president to
determine when and how the best interests of the country will
be served in dealing with foreign affairs.

" w"n me president, demanded
ay the senate for two of its. members
In order that Mr. Wilson might have
the views of the senate. Is the question
of entering upon a new war at this
time.
What Senator Kail, of New Mexico,
inay. think about the president's atti
tude, or what other political opponents
may say. is one thin but what Is act
ui!y lng to happen Is quite another.
The fact is that there is much more
concern In executive quarters over the
shutting down of American Industries,
and the throwing out of employment of
thousands of men because of the coal
strike, than there Is over embarking
on a new military campaign below the
Bio Grande.
- Effort! to make the public believe Niat
It will take only a handful of men to
"clean up" Mexico are not deceiving
the army officers as to the slse of the
.job. The American armv is more or
lstis shattered. Immobilization has been
precipitate Congress has cut appro
priations right and left. The Amerloan
air service has gone to pieces.
Other Duties Now.
The regular army is strategically dis
tributed to assist governors of states
In handling Industrial disturbances.
Calls for volunteers would have to be
made, and new appropriations and taxes
decided upon.
But, as said above, there Is not go
ing to be any military intervention just
now. Indeed, there is no reason to sup
pose that congress really wants more
war.
Of course, the president s refusal to
Intervene in Jesicq would enable the

Shock Makes

Worth Millions
Thought to he suffering from shell
Shock and laboring under the- halluci
nation that since he has been in the
army oil investments In Texas have
made him a millionaire, a man wearing
an oversens uniform has been negotiat
ing with several local automobiles sales
men and a Memphis real estate man
regarding the purchase of a car and a
home.
Walking Into the salesroom of an au,
tomoblle plant Thursday the soldier
inquired If a certain hlgh'-prlced limosj
slne was In stock. His fancy ran high.
Ifor the car sells at $5,000. He was shown
this auto, the demonstrator making
several trips over the city. He gave as
reference a bank In Pallas.
The man then was to be Introduced
to a real estate man. The latter, a
friend of the auto salesman, made a
tour of the city, showing the soldier
some of the handsomest residences in
Memphis. Included were the R. E. Gal
loway home and the residence built by
the latt George Brodnax, value of either
mounting well over 1100,000.
Name of the same Dallas bank was
given the realty man as reference, the
soldier saying ha had a large amount
on deposit there. Information in an
swer to telegrams to this bank, It Is
said, came Saturday and declared that
no such person was known.
Both the auto salesman and the real
ty man say the soldier offered no checks
nor made any advances as to the
drawing of money. His uniform is that
of a private bearing one overseas serv
ice stripe and Insignia of artillery.

Liquor Cases
Must Go Over
Over the protest of Ralph Davis, at

mistrial In the cases against "Pug"
Rogers. R. B alias "Happy," Lee. Joe
Conroy and Herman Tamble. charged
with conspiracy to violate the Reed
amendment, and continued the cases
until the next term of court.
This action was taken when W. P.
Kyscr, district attorney, reported to the
court that Tom Layman, one of the
principal witnesses for the government,
who disappeared during the trial Friday
afternoon, could not be found.
Layman was present In court Friday
afternoon and was sworn with other
Witnesses who were placed under the rule

grounds that the defendants had been
placed in jeopardy, but was overruled.

COAL STRIKE IS!
END, SAYS ROBERTS
At Knoxville Governor Tells
Miners and Operators That
Public Has Rights.
KNOXVILLE, Tenn., Pec. 6,-In an
address before a large assembly of citl
lens here this morning Gov. A. H Rob
erts served notice on both coal oper-
n .""i lnal miners that the coal
f-trtko m Tennessee muBt be terminated
He appealed to them both upon the
ground of self-interest and the higher
ground of patriotic duty to state and
na Ion, and declared that "should they
fail to heed this appeal, then the notice
Is served upon them that I shall forth
with take such steps and employ such
means as may seem best calculated to
produce the desired results."
The governor spoke In Market hall,
the city auditorium, and was heard by
a very large audience, including many
miners and operators, as well as Inter
ested citizens from Knoxville and other
points in Kast Tennessee He was ac
companied to the citv hv Att
General Frank M. Thompson and Adit -Gen.
K B. Sweeney, with both of whom
he was in conference this morning be
fore the address, and again this after
noon. Several operators and miners
also called upon the governor and dU
cussed with Mm the strike situation aim
tne coal supply in mis district. In hi
auuit.-s me governor said:
Governor's Ptoa.
"I deeply regret," ssld. Gov. Roberts,
in his appeal to the miners and oper
a,;rs of Tennessee to compose their
differences and begin the operation of
the mines forthwith, "that the time has
come In the development of the coal
strike now on In Tennessee when I feel
impelled by a sense of dutv to the pub
lic to take an active Interest In the op
eration of the coal mines of Tennes
see The people of Tennesse are now
facing a coal famine which not only
threatens great financial loss, but Im
perils the health and lives of the peo
ple. - . .
"The coal deposits of Tennessee are
Impressed, measurablv at least with a
public trust and use, and this trust and
use are so vital and necessary to the
very life of the people themselves that
it constitutes, in my Judgment, such a
right as should be protected and en-
iorceo on behalf of the public.
"As governor, I shall not tolerate anv
such use of property to be made as
will result In serious injury to the pub
lic. The right to use property is not
absolute, but Is relative only, The own
er of a gun has no right to u"se it to the
Injury of his fellows. Neither has the
owner of a coal mine the right to use
his property, or decline to use it to
the detriment and Injury of the public.
Notice is hereby served upon them that
they must either exercise their corpor
ate powers or forfeit their rights to do
so to the state which conferred them.
In other words, they must either mine
coal or exhaust every effort to do so, or
be prepared to answer the state for its
failure through its courts or military
power as the state may elect.
Right to Strike.
"On the other hand, the right to strike
Is not in any sense an absolute one;
indeed, the moral right does not exist
at all in favor of citizens engaged in
certain employments. Here Is a great
coal strike where a large number of
men have arrogated unto themselves the
right for the mere sake of a compara
tively small Increase In wages to freeae
the world Into submission to their de
mands, throwing hundreds of thousands
of laborers out of emuployment for
want of material with which to work,
and thus were wrecking our entire In
dustrial system."
The governor announced that since
the situation had become acute anil
"both sides In their stubbornness and
selfishness have manifested a dispo
sition to stand out against all entrea
ties" It became his duty to interevene
and assert the rights of the public. "To
this end." he declared. "I shall employ
all the resources of the state of Ten
nessee in both men and money."
Sentence was deferred in the cases of
Charles B. Renegar and Fritz Sodlni,
convicted during the week in the fed
eral court of violation of the war-time
prohibition act, pending a decision from
the United States supreme court.
The validity of the war-time prohibi
tion act was attacked Saturday by ("has.
M. Bryan, representing Renegar and
Sodlni, and In support of his conten
tion declared that President Wilson
had stated In a message to congress on
Nov. 11, 1918. "the war thus comes to
an end." This statement. Mr. Brvan
declared, definitely settled the disputed
point as to when the war officially end
ed. He cited Instances of periods of
years elapsing before peace treaties
were signed following other wars.
The supreme court of the United
States is to hand down a decision cov
ering this point during the coming
week und its decision will, of course,
definitely settle the question. Judge
McCall was noticeably Impressed with
the arguments presented by the attor
neys representing the defendants and
consented to a postponement of sen
tence. The verdict of a jury rendered earlier
In the week In the case against Bubber
Woods, negro, charging a violation of
the Reed amendment, was set aside hy
order of Judge McCall. Judge McCall
shared in the contention of the defense
that Woods had been convicted on
purely circumstantial evidence and that
there was a probability of bis innocence.

BY A. GOODFELLOW.
Today you will get a look behind the
scene. An extract from a few of the
letters that reach this office with their
pathetic and irresistible appeal will be
given just to show how imperative It
Is for everyone to get behind the Good-fellows-Santa
Claus club and put this
campaign over for the pure Joy of doing
it and because of the joy it will bring
to the desolate homes.
Scrawled upon a piece cf soiled paper
is this note: "I am six years old with
no one to support me but my grand
lather and he lit sick. I'ltasc let Sunta
Claus remember me."
A good woman wrote this letter for
her little friend: "1 am a little girl 14
months old.' My mother Ir sick, i won't
have any Chrlslriias unless Santa Claus
gets my name and brings me something
and brings my mother something to
eat."
Here Is one that shows evidence of
labor spent over its composition: "I
and my two little sisters haven't got
anything for Christmas, nothing to
wear, 110 hose and no clothes of any
kind, nor any mother. Our father is
nearly blind. I am 14 the next one Is
b and baby Is 2. Please send us some
thing. We will be pleased with any
thing." Here is one just as sad. Perhaps the
printing of it will cause someone else
to think what this plight means. Mayo
the father will see it: "Unless you re
member me my Christmas will be very
sad. My father and mother are not
together and iny mother is not able
to send Santa Claus to see me.
And this one: "I have a little brother
and we have no rather, will you pteasu
let Santa Claus come to see us?" Of
course the Goodfellows are going to be
a Santa Claus to that little fellow.
Surely this will reach your purse: "I
am a poor little girl and have a litti
brother 6 years old and one 10 years
old and I am 12 years old. I wish you
would give us something fur Christ
mas. Our mother Is unable to work
i.nd we don't have anything for Christ
mas but what you give us. My father
Is In Louisville.
Then here Is one from a mother
"Please be so good as to remember my
little girl. She was born after her
father died and I am not able to work
or get her anything for Christmas.
There are so many like this: "Will
you please send m something fot
Christmas. 1 have no father and live
with my grandfather. My mother works
but she can t help me.
Here is a lesson in real sacrifice. Con
tained 111 the letter was a 25-cent pleci:
"1 read in the paper where some little
girls had sent you some money they
made on their chickens. My mamma
Lgave me two little chickens and they
f ... Th..,. u,ai. In Ik, kn,.un
My grandfather gave me 25 cents for
one of them and I will sent it to you
Goodfellows to help some poor little
girl like me. I want all the children
to have a Christmas. My father is a
poor man but I know the good Santa
( laus will snare wun me.
"HKNRY ESTILL HILL."
"Toone, Tenn."
We have a long way to go if we
carry jnit our pledge that there shall
not be an empty stocking or a disap
pointed child on Christmas morning
What will you give to help keep th
pledge send a check to the Goodteliows,

CANNOT BOOST COAL
PRICE, GARFIELD SAYS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. Not one cent can be added to the
price of coal to finance any increases in the wages of miners, Fuel
Administrator Garfield declared today, after reading press dis
patches that Gov. Cox of Ohio
operators in that state compromise
vance in pay for the men.
nr. (iarfielrt indicated that the gov

the Increase could be given without ad

"There will be no Increase In the
present price of coal as fixed under
the Lever act," Dr. Oarfleld said, "no
matter what local arrangements and
agreements are put Into effect."
He added that his jKisltlon absolutely
was unchanged from that taken on
Nov, 26, with the authorisation of the
cabinet. Or. Garfield explained then.
In suggesting the 14 per cent advance,
which the miners promptly rejeoled.
that lie was not fixing wage scales,
and had no authority to do so.
He Indicated the Increase suggested
was merely that which the operators
were able to grant without advancing

Knowing that a game of such siae

SPEEDY SIGNING
IN DRASTIC NOTE
PARIS, Dec. 6. In a note drafted by the supreme council
today it is demanded that Germany sign the protocol providinf
for the carrying out of the peace terms, failing which the allies,
it is set forth, will be obliged to have recourse to military mea
sures, The utmost secrecy is being observed regarding the terms
of the note, which was unanimously adopted by the council this
morning, but it can be said that it is worded so firmly that con
ference circles expect the discussion with Germany regarding the
putting of the treaty into force will be finally closed.

Some speculation Is being Indulged lr

eneeuu Thursday declared ths allies
were misinformed regarding their com
plain! that Uermsny was exceeding by
far Ihe limit the military forces per
mitted her under the treaty. Von
lersner declared the government had
never sought to conceal the fact that
the creation of deteitlvo police foreos
and civic guards would he necsssary,
and thai the tierman government was
prepared to submit proofs to Oen. Nol

out the treaty terms.
The text of Premier ( 'lemencesu's

that Germany was charged, In addttlor

customs payment s on goods entering;
Germany by land be made in gold, as
had ii Iready been done on goods sent

until the peace treaty Is put Into force.
It was explained that the allies de

delays she was raising regarding tha

with the unfavorable economic measures
