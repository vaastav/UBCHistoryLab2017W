omplotely paralyzed coal mining In tho
aorthtrn part of Coahulla. All this lm
aienso coal mlnlnc district Is deserted nnd
Sot a pound of coal has been extracted
Hnc last February.
All tha mines have either been totally
4atroyed or filled with water as a re
nit of tho operations of the rebels In
that part of the State, Plants were dyna
mited and the employees wero compelled
to flea or to Join the rebels. These plants
eould be repaired and trre mines could
resume operations within six weeks If
laborers and railroad cars cculd be ob
tained. All the coal used by the smelt

In this part of the republic Is being Im
ported from the United States at winter
rates.
Men Interested in tho rubber Industry
throughout the country are Indignant over
the new tax of fifteen centavos per kilo
gram, which is being levied by the Gov
ernment, as each case of rubber shipped
here contains one hundred rounds and
tha tax also applies to the weight of the
Itnhhrr Price Inerenard.
The prlco of rubber has greatly In
creased recently nnd although It has now
reached forty ents u pound thir tax
eats up almost all tho profit. Many big
rubber concerns, especially In the soutk
arn part of the republic, havo discontin
ued tapping nnd hundreds havo been
thrown out of work. Much American cap
ital Is involved tu this Industry in Mex
ico. The Oovcrnment Is facing a recrudes
cence of tho Zapatista movement In the
State of Morelos. The Morelos situation

argument that If American recognition
had been accorded to Huerta and be had
been thus enabled to borrow money in
Europe ho could before this havo put

Tho First National flank of Hayonne,

"In view of tho depletion of our cash
reserve, which leaves us with Insuindent
funds to meet our requirements, because
of our dlftlculty to Immediately realize'
ready cash on our securities, it haa been
decided to place) tho bank temporarily In
the custody of the national bank i vnmln

fully protected,"
Mr. Cnrrngan added that Chnrles
Chapman, a national bank examiner, had
concluded nn examination of the bank'ti
books last night and decided that It was
not In condition to open this morning. Mr.
Carragnii expressed conllelence that tlie af
fairs of tho Institution woulel bn arranged
so that It wouhl rcsumo business again
in two or three days.
Ho salel that the examiner had decided
that thn bank hail loaned loo much money
on notes. This. Mr. Carrngan said, was
the only difficulty. "Tho bunk Is in
good shape," ho said, 'but wo havo been
a little too liboral In the matter of loans."
For tho paet we-ok rumors wero being
