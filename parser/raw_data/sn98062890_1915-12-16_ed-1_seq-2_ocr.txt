Proposed Army Increase. S%|
They contemplate an Increase of the

standing force of the regular army from
its present strength of 5,023 officers and
102,085 enlisted men of all services to a
strength of 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlist
ed men, or 141,843, all told, all services
rank and file, by the addition of
whether they responded to such a call to
service or not. It would depend upon the
patriotic spirit of the employers of the
country whether they made it possible for
the younger men in their employ to re
spond under favorable conditions or not.
I, for one, do not doubt the patriotic de
votion either of our young men or of
those who Rive them employment—those
for Vhose benefit and protection they
would IN fact enlist. I would look for
ward to the success of such an experiment
with entire confidence.
At least s° much by way of prepara

less.

strength and efficiency and to press that
plan to completion within the next five
years. We have always looked to the
navy of the country as our first and chief

U. S. Merchant Marine.
But armies and instruments of war are
only part of what has to be consjderea If
•We are to consider the supreme "matter of
national self-sufficiency and security in
all its aspects. There are other gres
matters which will be thrust upon our at
tention whether we will or not. There is,
for exumple, a very pressing question of
trade and shipping Involved in this great
problem of national adequacy. It is neces
for many weighty reasons of national ef
ficiency and development that we should
have a great merchant marine. The great
merchant fleet we once used to make us
rich, that great body of sturdy sailors
who used to carry our flag Into every sea,
and who were the pride and often the
bulwark of the nation, we have almost
driven out of existence by inexcusable
neglect and indifference and by a hope
lessly blind and provincial policy of so
called economic protection. It is high
time we repaired our mistake and resumed
our commercial Independence on the seas.
Why Ships Are Needed.
For It is a question of Independence. If

It seems, are at their mercy, to do with
it seems, are at their mercy, to do with
as they please. We must use their ships,
and use them as they determine. We
have not ships enough of our own. We
cannot handle our own commerce on the
seas. Our independence is provincial, and
is only on land and within our own bor
ders. We are not likely to be permitted
to use even tho ships of other nations in
rivalry of their own trade, and are with
out means to extend our commerce even
where the doors are wide open and our
goods desired. Such a situation is not to
be endured. It is of capital Importance
not only that the United States should
be its own carrier on the seas and enjoy
the economic independence which only an
adequate merchant marine would give it,
but also that the American hemisphere
as a whole should enjoy a like Indepen
dence and self-efficiency, If it is not to be
drawn into the tangle of European affairs.

Moreover, we can develop no true or ef

our own—not ships of war, but ships of
peace, carrying goods and carrying much
more creating friendships and rendering
indispensable services to all interests on
this side of the water. They must move
constantly back and forth between the
Americas. They are the only shuttles
that can weave the delicate fabric of

the sincere conviction that there are few
measures you could adopt which would
more serviceably clear the way for the
great policies by which we wish to make
good, now and always, our right to lead
in enterprises of peace and good will and
economic and political freedom.
.The plans for the armed forces of the
nation which I have outlined, and for the
general policy of adequate preparation
ror mobilization and defense, involve of
course very large additional expenditures
°L
which will con­
siderably exceed the estimated revenues
of the government. It is made my duty
by law, whenever the estimates of expen
diture exceed the estimates of revenue
to call the attention of the congress to
the fact and suggest any means of meet
ing the deficiency that it may be wise
or possible for me to suggest. I am ready
to believe that it would be mv duty to
do so in any case: and I feel particularly
bound to speak of the matter when It ap
pears that the deficiency will arise di
rectly out of the adoption by the congress
of measures which I myself urge it to
adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak
briefly of the present state of the treas
ury and of the fiscal problems which the
next year will probably disclose.
Problems of Revenue.
On the 13th of une, last, there was an
available balance in the general fund of
the treasury of ?104,170,105.7S. The total
estimated receipts for the year 3916, on
the assumption that the emergency rev
enue measure passed by the last congress
will not be extended beyond its present
limit, the 31st of December, 1915, and that
the present duty of 1 cent per pound on
sugar will be discontinued after the first
of May, 1916, will be $670,365,500. The bal
ance of June last and these estimated rev
enues come, therefore, to a grand total
of $774,535,605.78. The total estimated dis
bursements for the present fiscal year,
including $25,000,000 for the Panama canal,
$12,000,000 for probable deficiency appro
priations, and $50,000 for miscellaneous
debt redemptions, will be $753,891,000 and
the balance In the general fund of the
treasury will be reduced to $20,644,605 78
The emergency revenue act, if continued
beyond its present time limitation, would
produce, during the half year then re
maining, about $41,000,000. The duty of
1 cent per pound on sugar, if continued,
would produce during the two months of
the fiscal year remaining after the first
of May, about $15,000,000. These two sums
amounting together to $56,000,000, if added
to the revenue of the second half of tho
fiscal year, would yield the treasury at
the end of the year an available balance
of $76,644,005.78.
The additional revenues required to
carry out the program of military and
naval preparation of which I have spo
ken, would, as at present estimated, be
for the fiscal year 1917, $93,800,000. Those
figures, taken with the figures for the
present fiscal year which 1 have already
given, disclose our financial problem for
the year 1917. Assuming that the taxes
imposed by tho emergency revenue act
and the present duty on sugar are to be
discontinued, and that the balance at
the close of the present fiscal year will
be only $20,611,60a.7S, that the disburse
ments for the Panama canal will again
be about $25,000,000, and that the addi
tional expenditures for tho army and
navy are authorized by the congress, the
deficit in the grneral fund of the treasury
on tho 13tli of .Tune, 1917, will be nearly
$235,000,000. To this sum at least $58,000,000
should be added to represent a safe work
ing balance for the treasury, and $12,000,
... uuuitiuiia vvwitiu
make a total deficit of some $297,000,000. If
the present taxe3 should be continued
present taxes should be continued
throughout this year and the next, how
ever, there would be a balance in the
treasury of some $76,500,000 at the end of
the present fiscal year, and a deficit at
the end of the next year of only some
$50,000,000, or, reckoning in $62,000,000 for
deficiency appropriations and a safe
treasury balance at the end of the year,
a total deficit of some $112,000,000. The
obvious moral of the figures is that it is
a plain counsel of prudence to continue
all of the present taxes or their equiva
lents, and confine ourselves to the prob
lem of providing $112,000,000 of new rev
enue rather than $297,000,000.

Must Pay as We Go.
How shall we obtain the new revenue?
We are frequently reminded that there are
millions of bonds which the treasury is
authorized under existing law to sell to
reimburse the sums paid out of current
revenues for tho constvuction of the Pan
ama canal and it is true that bonds to
tho amount of approximately
$222,000,000
are now available for that purpose. Prior
to 1913 $134,631,980 of these bonds had actu
ally been sold to recoup the expenditures
at the isthmus and now constitute a con
siderable item of the public deft. But I,
for one, do not believ.e that the people of
this country approve of postponing the
payment of their bills. Bon-owing money
is short-siglited finance. It can be justi
fied only when permanent things are to
be accomplished which many generations
will certainly benefit by and which it
seems hardly fair that a single genera
tion should pay for. The objects we are
now proposing to spend money for cannot
fcc so classified, except In the sense that
everything wisely done may be said to be
done in the Interest of posterity as well
as in our own. It seems to me a clear dic
tate of prudent statesmanship and frank
finance that in what we are now, I hope,
about to undertake we should pay as we
go. The people of the country are en
titled to know just what burdens of tax
ation they are to carry, and to know from
the outset, now. The new bills should
be paid by internal taxation.
To what sources, then, shall -we turn?
This is so peculiarly a question which the
gentlemen of the House of Representatives
are expected under the constitution to
propose an answer to that you will hardly
expect me to do more than discuss it In
very general terms. We should be follow
ing an almost universal example of mod
ern governments if we were to draw the
greater part or even the whole of the
revenues we need from the income taxes.

000,000. In a country of great Industries
like this it ought to be easy to distribute
the burdens of taxation without making
them anywhere bear too heavily or too ex
clusively upon any one set of persons or
undertakings. What is clear, is, that the
industry of this generation should pay
the bills of this generation.
I have spoken to you today, gentlemen,
upon a single theme, the thorough prepa
ration of the nation to care for Its own
security and to make sure of entire free
dom to play the impartial role in this
hemisphere and In the world which we
all believe to have been providentially as
signed to it. I have had In my mind no
thought of any Immediate or particular
danger arising out of our relations with
other nations. We are at peace with all
the nations of the world, and there is rea
son to hope that no question In contro
versy between this and other govern
...snts will lead to any serious breach of
amicable relations, grave as some dif
ferences of attitude and policy have been
and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry
to say that the gravest threats against
our national peace and safety have been
uttered within our own borders. There
are citizens of the United States, I blush
to admit, born under other flags but wel
comed under aur generous naturalization
laws to the full freedom and opportunity
of America, who have poured the poison
of disloyalty into the very arteries of our
national life who have sought to bring
the authority and good name of our gov
ernment Into contempt, to destroy our In
dustries wherever they thought It effec
tive for thPir vlnd'ctlve purposes to
strike at them, and to debase our politics
to the uses of foreign intrigue. Their
number is not great as compared with
the whole number of those sturdy hosts
by which our nation has been enriched
in recent generation out of virile foreign
stocks but it is great enough to have
brought deep disgrace upon us and to
have made it nccessary that we should
promptly make use of processes of law by
which we may be purged of their corrupt
distempers. America never witnessed
anything like this before. It never
dreamed it possible that men sworn into
its own citizenship, men drawn out of
great free stocks such #.s supplied some
of tho best and strongest elements of that
little, but how heroic, nation that in a
high day of old staked its verv life to free
itself from every entanglement that had
darkened the fortunes of the older na
tions and set up a new standard here—
that men of such origins and such free
choices of allegiance would ever turn in
malign reaction against the government
and people who had welcome and nur
tured them and seek to make this proud
country once more a hotbed of European
passion. A litle while ago such a thing
would have seemed incredible. Because
it was Incredible we made no preparation
for It. We would have been almost
ashamed to prepare for It, as If we were
suspicious of ourselves our own comrades
and neighbors. But the ugly and incred
ible thing has actually come about anu
we are without adequate federal laws to
deal with it. I urge you to enact such
laws at the earliest possible moment and
feel that in doing so I am urging you to
do nothing less than save the honor and
self respect of the nation. Such crea
tures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy
must be crushed out. They are not many,
but they are infinitely malignant, and the
hand of our power should close over them
at once. They have formed- plots to de
stroy property, they have entered into
conspiracies against the neutrality of the
government, they have sought to pry
into every confidential transaction of the
government In order to serve Interests
alien to our own. It Is possible to deal
with these things very effectually. I
need not suggest the terms In which they
may be dealt with.
Disloyal Americans.
I wish that it could be said that only
a few men, misled by mistaken senti
ments of allegiance to the governments
under which they were born, had been
guilty of disturbing the self possession
and misrepresenting the temper and prin
ciples of the country during these days
of terrible war, when it would seem that
every man who was truly an American
would instinctively make it his duty and
his pride to keep the scales of judgment
even and prove himself a partisan of no
nation but his own. But it cannot. There
are some men among us, and many resi
dent abroad who, though born and bred
in the United States and calling them
selves Americans, have so forgotten
themselves and their honor as citizens as
to put their passionate sympathy with
one or the other side In the great Euro
pean conflict above their regard for the
peace and dignity of the United States,
jiiey also preach and practice disloyalty.
j\o laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions
of the mind and heart but I should not
speak of others without also speaking of
these and expressing the even deeper hu
miliation and scorn which every self pos
sessed and thoughtfully patriotic Ameri
can must feel when he thinks of them
and of the discredit they are daily bring
ing upon us.
Domestic Affairs.
While we speak of the preparation of
the nation to make sure of her security
and her effective power we must not fall
Into the patent error of supposing that
her real strength comes from armaments
and mere safeguards of written law. It
comes, of course, from her people, their
energy, their success In their undertak
ings, their free opportunity to use the
natural resources of our great home land
and of the lands outside our continental
borders which look to us for protection,
for encouragement, and for assistance in
their development from the organization
and freedom and vitality of our economic
life. The domestic questions which en
gaged the attention of the last congress
are more-vital to the nation in this its time
of test than at any other time. We can
not adequately make ready for any trial
of our strength unless we wisely and
promptly direct the force of our laws Into
these all-Important fields of domestic ac
tion. A matter which it seems to me we
should have very much at heart is the cre
ation of the right Instrumentalities by
which to mobilize our economic resources
in any time of national necessity. I take
it for granted that I do not need your au
thority to call into systematic consultation
with the directing ifficers of the army
and navy men of recognized leadership
and ability from anltng our citizens who
are thoroughly familiar, for example, with
the transportation facilities of the country
and therefore competent to advise how
they may be co-ordinated when the need
arises, those who can suggest the best
way in which to bring about prompt co
operation among the manufacturers of
the country, should it be necessary, and
those who could assist to bring the tech
nical skill of the country to the aid of the
government In the solution of particular
problems of defense. I only hope that If
I should find It feasible to constitute sucTi
an advisory body the congress would be
willing to vote the sma.il sum of money
that would be needed to defray the ex
penses that would probably be necessary
to give it the clerical and administrative
machinery with which to do serviceable
work.
Vocational Education.
What Is more important is, that the in
dustries and resources of the country
should be available and ready for mo
bilization. It la the more impera
tively necessary, therefore, that we
should promptly devise means for
doing what we have not yet done
that we should give Intelligent fed
eral aid and stimulation to Industrial and
vocational education, as we have long
done in the large field of our agricultural
industry that, at the same time that we
safeguard and conserve the natural re
sources of the country we should put them
at the disposal of those who will use them
promptly and intelligently, as was sought
to be done in the admirable bills submitted
to the last congress from Its committees
on the public lands, bills which I earnestly
recommend in principle to your considera
tion that we should put into early opera
tion some provision for rural credits
which will add to the extensive borrowing^
facilities already afforded the farmer by^

Many conditions about which we have,
repeatedly legislated are being altered^
from decade to decade, it is evident, un

change even more rapidly and more radi

us, when peace has returned to the world

with the energy of those who must b«
stir themselves to build anew. Just what
these changes will be no one can certainly
foresee or confidently predict. There are
no calculable, because no stable, elements
in the problem. The most we can do Is
to make certain that we have the neces
sary Instrumentalities of information con
stantly at our service so that we may
be sure that we know exactly what we
are dealing with when we come to act,
if It should be necessary to act at all.
We must first certainly know what it is
that we are seeking to adapt ourselves to.
I may ask the privilege of addressing you
more at length on this important matter
a little later in your session.
Transportation Problem.
In the meantime may I make this sug
gestion? The transportation problem la
an exceedingly serious and pressing ono
in this country. There has from time to
time of late been reason to fear that our
railroads would not much longer be able
to cope with It successfully, as at present
equipped and coordinated. I suggest that
it would be wise to provide for a commis
sion of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough
canvass of tne whole question whether
our laws as at present framed and ad
ministered are as serviceable as they
might be in the solution of the problem.
It is obviously a problem that lies at the
very foundation of our efficiency as a
people. Such an inquiry ought to draw
out every circumstance and opinion
worth considering and we need to know
all sides of the matter if we mean to do
anything in the field of federal legisla
tion.
No one, I am sure, would wish to take
any backward step. The regulation of
the railways of the country by federal
commission has had admirable results
and has fully justified the hopes and ex
pectations of those by whom the policy
of regulation was origlnadly proposed.
The question is not what should wo un
do? It Is. whether there is anything else
we can do that would supply us with ef
fective means, in the very process of reg
ulation, for bettering the conditions un
der which the railroads are operated and
for making them more useful servants of
the country as a whole. It seems to me
that It might be the part of wisdom,
therefore, before further legislation in
this field is attempted, to look at the
whole problem of coordination and effi
ciency In the full light of a fresh assess
ment of circumstance and opinion, as a
guide to dealing with the several parts
of it.
For what we are seeking now, what In
my mind Is the single thought of this
message, Is national efficiency and secur
ity. We servo a great nation. We should
serve it in the spirit of its peeular genius.
It is the genius of common men for self
government, industry, justice, libertv and
peace. We should see to it that it lacks
no instrument, no facility or vigor of law
to make It sufficient to play its part with
energy, safety and assured success. In
this we are no partisans but heralds and
prophets of a new age.
Boots for Russian Troops.
By the end of October, the Jiji re
ports, 1,000,000 pairs of boots had been
exported from Japan to Russia, and it
further reports that a contract has
been signed calling for the delivery of
from 50,000 to 100,000 pairs a month
until the cessation of hostilities. The
contract price was not made public,
but it is generally assumed to be $425,
000 for 100,000 pairs. Japan's capacity
for the manufacture of boots is such
that it will probably have no difficulty
in filling the order.
The same paper is authority for the
statement that an order for munitions
of war worth $8,500,000 has been
placed with as Osaka merchant, but
no details of the nature of the supplies
are given.
Another Japanese paper reports a
war order for 3,500,000 yards of woolen
cloth valued at $5,00'0,000. It remarks
that a result of this order will be a tre
mendous rise In the price of woolen
cloth because of the domestic requix-e
ments. This is the second large wool
en cloth order from Russia.
