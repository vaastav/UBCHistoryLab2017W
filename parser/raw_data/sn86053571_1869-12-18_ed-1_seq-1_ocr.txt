LrxDOr, Dec. IT Th Tmett In an arti
cle on the Atabama etal mi, saysi If Mr.
Motley proposes that ne tHtatlons for the
settlement of the Alabaj n claims bo re
opened at Washington, tht 1 proposal will be
accepted. Wo must add that It would bo
useless to negotiate, or talk of negotiating,
nnlesseach side Is prep red to enter upon
tho negotiation with confij lenco tn the honor
of the other. The charge made by the
Americans Is that wo did n t show tho proper
feeling towards them daring tbe wart that
our want of proper feollng led us to afford
unfair assistance to their enemies.
Th defence Is that Jt waa our duty to
abstain from showing; a feeling toward
either aide, and that th alleged unfair as
sistance was the strict observance of neu
trality. It Is plain that satisfactory rela
tions between the two eoantrlos cannot bo
restorsd until wo understand and respect
tbe craving of the Americans for Sympathy,
and they understand tha difficulties of our
situation as Impartial bystanders, Injured
by a war In which we firit bound to abstain
from Interference. Wo shall never arrlvo at
the restoration of friendehlp if we begin In
a spirit of pettifogging attorneys.
American writers and statesmen may re
member with advantage onr blood Is, after
all, not very different from their own.
Englishmen have susceptibilities as well as
Americans. It Is not Improbable that we ,
shall bo drawn towards America by tho
suggestion that we are Insincere and bent on
hoodwinking thoe with whom wo profess to
be dealing openly.

Mr Thurman aald the Senator had been so
earnestly engaged In putting down erroneous

the conclusion that a State has no rights He

To corrsct an erroneous Impression In re
gsrd to tho character of the Exhibition to bo
held In London In 1871, we print tho follow
ing letter addressed to Mr. C. F. Slansbury,
gtrlng official Information as to that Exhi
bition, which, It will bo perceived, In no way
Interferes with tho feasibility of tho pro

tbe Commissioners of that of 13 51. It Is to

ited In extent. The object wltl bo selected
by competent Judges before they arc admit

will be admitted each year. Tho arrange

to nationalities, as heretofore. The exhibi

ranging and taking caro of objects daring

September 30. Foreign countries wilt not
bavo placed at their absolute disposal space

Tho enclosure which accompanied rour
letter will bo forwarded.
Itblnk there Is nothing In tbe London
exhibition to deter the movement for the
Washington one. Ono Is to bo verv limited
and tbo other universal. And while I be
lieve many Americans will exhibit at both,
an Immense effort will bo raado by foreign
manuiaciurer to do Dniiianuy ana euonau

will do if Congress acts promptly and with a
Jar-t appreciation of tbo great benefit they
