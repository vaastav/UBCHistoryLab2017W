able te make sure whether tho disi-ase has
rosily finished its oeeree, and whether there
he still some diseases' spot from which it
might again arise as a name from a spark
hidden by ashes.
" Of greater import nee, however, than its
dkgtteettc use, k the tborapatic effect of the
remedy.
'"The place cbeon for (he injection after
several trials of other places was the skin of
the buck bet ween t lie shoulder blades and tha
lumbar region, liocaune Mere the injection led
to the least local resctiou, generally none stall,
and ws almcist pititiloM. As regards tho
edicts of the remedy on the human jwtieut,
It was dear from Ulie beginning of the re
search that iu one very important parlh'ular
the hamaa being reacts to the rewody oiaer
ontly from Uie auimal sewerallj' ased iu ox
ei intents, namdy, the puiHca-pJc. A new
iroof for the eKjicriimniter of the all-importaiit
aw that experiment on aatuiak ie net conclu
sive, for tihe human patient proved extraordi
narily more facusitive than the guiuon-pig.
"Although the onset of the remedy ia equal
doses is vory dinonwt in animals aud in humau
beings, if calculated by body weight, in some
other respeots there is much Httuilarily iu tha
symptoms produced, tlte most imHrtaut of
those resemblances beinp the specific action of
tits remedy ou tho tulicrcuious process, tbo
varieties of which I will not here describe. I
will make no further lefereuee to its uifocts on
animals, hut I will at ones turn to its extraor
dinary action on tuhorcttlosik in human boiiips.
Tho healthy human being reacts either not at
all, or locaroely at all, as wo have seen, when
0 01 cubic contiuiftter is M'ed. The same holds
good with regard te MitieMts fluttering front
diseases other thau tahereuloMs, as ropcatod
OKnerimouts huve proved ; bsi thu case is very
diner out whuii the iIhuuho is faArrceoiSc. A
dose of 0.01 cubic centimeter injetted subcu
taueoualy into tuheu-ulous patiuuts causes u
soveru Konerai reaction ait well ae a local one.
" I ftave children, afjed from two to six years,
one-tenth of this dose that is te my, 0.001
cubic centimeter vory delicate children only
0.0005 cubic centimeter, and obtained power
ful, but in no way dangerous, reaction. The
general reaction constate iu an attack of fever,
whioh usually begins with rigor, aud rises the
totuperatHro above Htt, often up te 40, and
even 4lC. This is accouipaiied by pain in
titie 1 1 in lis, couching, great fatigue and often
sickness and vomiting In several cases a
sitxht ictet'oid discoloration was observed, aud
occasionally an orunliou like raraides on tho
oheat Hud neck. The attack usually begins four
to five hours after (ha injection, and lasts from
IS te 15 hours. Occasionally it begius later aud
thou runs its course with less intensity.
' Tho patients are very liuhj aitbcled by the
attack, and as mmm as it k over feel compara
tively well, generally bettot than bofore. Tho
looal reactiou (a bo best observed in cases in
which the tuberculous affoction is visible; (or
instance, in cases of Input, changes take place
which show the t-pecific anti-tuberculous action
of the remedy to a most surprising degree. A
few hours after an injection into the k in of
the latch that is, in a spot far removod from
tho diseased area on the face or elsewhere the
lupus bogins ton well sad to redden, and this it
does generally before the initial rigor. During
the fever the swelling aud redness increase,
nod niay finally roach a high degree, so that
the lupus tissue becomes brow uinh aud necrotic
iu places whore the growth was sharply defined.
We sometimes fouud a much swollen and
brownish spot surrvundod by a whitish edge
almost one centiuu-ier wide, which again was
surrounded by a broad baud of bright red.
"After the subsidence of the fever the swell
ing of the lupus tissue gradually decreases and
disapiwars in about two or three days. The
lupus spots themselves are then oovcred by a
soft deposit which filters outward aud dries iu
the air. The growth then changes te a crust,
which falls ofl' after twe or three weeks, ami
which sometimes utter only one iujecUou
leaves a clean, red cicatrix behind. Generally,
however, several injections are required for the
complete removal of the lupus Ussue: hut of
this, more later ou. J must meutiou asa iiofnt ef
aped at importance that the changes described
&r cKiioUy ooufiuod to the parts of the skin
affected with iu pes. Kven tboBcnalletft nodules,
and those most deeply hidden in the lupus tisues,
ge through the process aud booome visible in
oonsoQueuoe ef the swelling and change of color,
whilst Uie UShue itself in which Urn lupus
changes have entirely ce.ed remained un
changed. The observation of a lupus case
treated by the remedy is so iustrnctive, and is
necessarily so couvinoing, that those who wish
to infcke a trial ef the romody should. If possi
ble, begin with a ease of lupus.
(It should be remembered that lupus ia
now oonsidorod by pathologists te be tuber
ouloek of the akin.)
"Tho notion of tlte remedy in oases of
phthisis generally showed itsotf as follows:
Couch aud expectoration were generally in
creased a little after the first injection, thou
grew less aud le, and in the most favorable
casos entirely disappeared.
" Tlte most important point to be observed
in the new. treatment k its oaily application.
The proper su jucts for treatment are patients
iu the initial stage of pfatiikis, for iu thorn the
eurvtive action can be most fully hIiown, and
for this roason, toe, it cannot be toe seriously
jwfnted out that practitioners must Sa the
future be more tbaa over alivs to the import
ance of diagnosing phthisis in as early a stuge
as possible. Up to t be present time tbo proof
of tubercle bacilli in the epututn was con
sidered more as aa interesting point of seoon
dary importance, which, though it made diag
nosus more certain, cos id not help the patient
in any way, aud which, in ooiisequonoe, was
often itogluctad.
"Thk I have lately refieatedly had occasion
to observe ia numerous cases of phthisis which
had geuorally gene through the hands of (sev
eral doctors without auy examination of tbo
aputum having boca made. Jn the future this
muni he changed. A doctor who shall neglect
to diagnose phthisis iu its earliest stago by all
methods at his command, ospocially by exam
ining the sputum, will be guilty of tbo most
serious neglect of hk patient whose life may
depend uou the early application of tbe
specific treatment In cousequencu, in doubt
ful oaaee, medical practiouors must make sure
of the presence or absence of lulterculoeia, and
then ouly will the new tberajteutic method be
oeme a blessing to suffering humanity, when
all casos of tuberculosis are treated iu their
earliest stage aud ws no longer meet with nog
looted serious esses forming aa inextiugukb
able sou roe of fresh infoctions.H
Prom the foregoing atntemonts of Prof.
Koch his claims, it will be seen, fall very far
abort of what has beon attributed to him in
various publications, and yet they arc eufli
otont to create an entire change in the troat
mont of consumptive patients iu the early
fltagos. It mast be manifest to any one that
it k entirely useless to expect that the in
jection of any chemical substance whatever
will reproduce lung structures that have
beon thrown off during the progress of tho
dkoase, or to euro patients that are affected
with large oavittes. It k in tho beginning
of the disease that the greatest advantage
will be roaped from the application of tbo
new remedy. That Prof, Koah doea not
choose to distribute it promiscuously, or to
publkh te the world hk formula of prepara
tion! to quite as much an evidence that he
has not forgotten the llrewn-Sequard fail
ure as it to of his wisdom. The prepara
tion of this remedy is necessarily one that
requires the highest degree of skill in
bacteriology, and while hundreds of medi
cal men are theoretically onliroly acquainted
with haotoriology, tho number that are
praotioally familiar with it is very limited.
Thofuture alone will demonstrate how much
hope may he oxtondod to Buffering humnn
Ity from the Koch remedy. In tbe mean
time it to suggested that we patiently await
further developments. I have Enid enough
to show the reason why most medical men
of this country give credence to tbe an
nouncements of Prof. Koch, and what they
hope from thk new Consumption Cure.

ABOUT BIG BOWLDERS.
A LIttIo Geological Talk of General Interest
Some Hocking Stones.
St. NicheJtiB.
Whonevor tho glacior molted, thoy left an
immense amount of ''drift" that is, sand,
gravel, and steiios of all sorts, which had been
frosen in the ice whou the glaciers woro form
ing. The stones of th is drift arc of all sizes. Somo
are as small as pebMes, others as largo as small
houses. Tin re u one at Bradford Mass.,
which measures 3U feet each way and weighs
4,500,kkj pounds. There is another on a ledgo
in Vrimnnt which is cvon larger than that, and
which m nst have boen carried by tbe ice across
a valley lying 500 feet below wbero tho stone
now is, shewing that the ice wasftOO feet thick.
Great ltowlders of trait-rock extend through
Connecticut on a line running to Long Island
Sound ; and as some of the same kind are found
in Loug Island, the glacier is bclicvod to bavo
crossed the sound, carrying these rocks with it
An immense statue of Peter tbe Great, in St.
Pel rsburg, stands ou these glacier bowldora of
solid granite which weighs 3,000,000 pounds.
One of tho largest bowldors iu America is in
the Indian village of Mohegan, near Montvillo,
Coon. Tho Indians call the rock " Shedegan."
Its top, which is fiat and largo as tho floor of a
good -i nod room, is reached by a ladder.
Sometimes these bowlders aro fouud perched
upon bare ledges of rock, so nicely balanced
that, though of great weight thoy may bo
rocked by hand. They aro called " rocking
stones." Kear the littlo Connecticut village of
Koauk, on Long Island Sound, there is an im
mense bowlder, called by the pooplo there
"Jomimy's Pulpit." Jt was formerly n roek-ing-stono.
Hut tho rock has worn away below
it and it can no longer be moved.
Poaoc Meeting In Sajhraek (Conn.) In 1501
Lymt (0Hn.) Sound Ilrceie.
Some lime since a request came from Knnsas
for particulars concerning a Poaco mooting held
at Sayhrook in the Summer of 1861. Mr. Wm.
li. 'looker, of Uocavillc, kindly furnishes us
with remembrances of tbe occasion. During
this Summer (1861), Bridgeport had a rousing
Peace meeting, and it uns a livoly time all
around. It created great excitement all ovor
tbe State, wheu tho Sayhrook meeting was an
nounced and extensively advertised ; pooplo
naturally looked for a scrimmage, and a largo
crowd collected to soo that all went right.
Henry Lord, Charles Martin, William Brock
way, and our writer, Mr. Tooker, natives
ot Hamburg, wont to Lyme in a sail-boat; tho
landlord of tbo Bacon House loaned thorn a
large U. S. ensign aud accompanied the party
to ijaybrook; this party was added toas llto.trip
from the river to Haybiook continued. A long
maple pole was cut and the ons.gn fas toned to
it; tbo tallest of the party was chosen color
bear or and carried tbo flag. They marched to
tho flagstaff iu Sayhrook which was to float
the peace flag, attached their ensign aud hoist
ed away, but alas, when tbo old gridiron
reached tbe truck it camo fluttering to the
g rue nd, halliards and all, some greeny having
f6Lcudod the halliards with a granny kuot
which pulled out with the above result. Then
came the tug of war. The peaceites seized
one end of tha halliard aud the m a rites the
other.
The warites dually obtained possession of
halliard, flag, and the field. One man was
knocked down and somewhat bruised; bo was
true blue though, and was soon on dock again ;
his name was Osmer Panuolco und resided in
Essex.
The pescoites tbroatenod to shoot anyono
who attempted to replace the halliards. Our
writer, Mr. Tooker, being, as he expresses it,
somewhat thick hided as well as thick headed,
took chances aud went up tbo pole. Upon reach
ing the cross-tioes it was found that the topmast
was too weak to bear the woight of Air. Tooker,
aud volunteers among the boys were called for,
one brave little fellow did the act; he shinned
the topmast, rovo the halliard and slid grace
fully to the ground. His namo cannot bo re
called, but his ago was under 1-1 years, and I
would be pleased to learn the name of tbo boy.
Our Joe (Senator Hawley) was at the meeting,
and a horse was taken from a convenient wagon
aud Senator Hawley, jumping into the wagon,
was hauled to the flsg sUtl' by tbe warites amid
deafening cheers; hero he made a rousing speech.
There were no Peace flags floatod that day,
neither were there auy Peace spcochos.
Wm. Brock way, now a rcsidout of Kansas,
served in Uie 10th Conn., aud was wounded at
Roanoke Island. Mr. Tooker served four years
Iu the 13th Coim., and now rosidos at Uncus
ville, whether Mr. Martin sorvod in tho late
war or not, 1 am unablo to say.

If yon meet ox-Gov. Lsdd, of Bhodo Island,
ask him how bo turned tbo laugh on n group of
distinguished people amid whom ho sat in the
presidential grand stand at tbo Grand Army
display. Everybody who is on speaking terms
with him know) that bo is as proud of bis little
Stale as though it was as big as Texas, aud the
chatting to which ho was subjected whilo tho
thousands of men in tbo Departments from the
great Slates were marching past was not calcu
lated to make h.iu particularly comfortable.
" Don't forget your spyglasses when Littlo
Rhody's Department is duo," cautioned Gov.
Butleigh.
"I say, Ladd, don't you want to borrow n
man to carry a flag for your boys?" shouted
Gov. Bulkier over tbo bonds of rows of people.
" Is it possible that Kbodo Island has u Depart,

Alger.
And so it went for a conplo of hours. Fi
nally, Littlo Khody's Department flag was des

Mr. Ladd was surprised himself at tho dis

Qlole, was his famousjoku about tbe well-known
pastor of tbe Columbus Avenue Univcrimlist
Church, Boston, whose antipathy to tho liquor
interest Is a matter of common knowledge
Gen. Collins said that Dr. A. A. Miner would be
a vory good man If be would only let rum alone.
Dr. Minor Is ordinarily a very genial, magnetic

frenzy, but tbo military authorities bavo en
vironed tho disaffected savages so thoroughly
that an outbreak is not feared. Gen. Miles has
almost surrounded the different sRcncics with
troops, which aro so placed that tho liuo in any
part of it can lo cosily reinforced from any
point, and the Indians who aro the ringloadcrs
of tbo revolt are perfectly awaro of those con
ditions, so it is safe to say that thoy will bo
vory careful regarding their future movements.
Gon. Miles has been in Washington talking
over tbo situation with tho President, tbo Sec
retary of War, Sccrolary Noble and Gen. Scho
field, and left for Chicago on Monday, Dec. 1.
Ho has full instructions as to tbo courso to pur
sue, and he will go at ouco to tbo sccno of tho
disturbance if advices requiro his presunco
after bo roaches his headquarters in Chicago.
It is said that the ghost dances are to be im
mediately stopped, the Indians indulging in
them aro to bo both disarmed aud dismounted,
and that those who are prominent iu tho dis
turbance are to be taken and placed iu confine
ment. If this plan is carried out thoro is littlo
doubt but that ono of tbo greatest uprisings of
tho plain Indians will bo shortlived. Tho mili
tary authorities chum that they aro in complolo
control of the situation, and will mako short
work of the ghost dancers if they make tho least
break.
Surjr.-Gtn. Baxter Taraljied.
While going from his ofilco to his home on
Monday ovening, Dec. 1, Surg.-Gen. J. H. Bax
tor, U. S. Army, was strieken with paralysis on
New York avonuo. Ho sank to the pavemont
and immediately became unconscious. Ho was
taken into a bouso aud 'received medical aid,
aud was thon removed to his homo. His con
dition was found to bo exceedingly critical, and
it was thought that bo could not recover. Gon.
Baxter was recently appointed Surgeon-General
of the Army, has been a vory active man all his
life, was a tnoderato liver, and had never boforo
had any premonition of paralysis.
Unfarorable Sjrniptomsln AdwJral Porter's Cane.
Admiral D. D. Porter has boon ill for Bevoral
months, and no hopes aro now entertained of
his ullimato recovery. Ho has bad a complica
tion of diseases, although the bronchial trouble
aud tbo swelling of tbe limbs have disappeared.
Ho cannot now leave his room, and it is not
likoly that ho over will leave it alivo. Ono of
his sons is constantly in attendance upon him.
Tho Admiral was a powerful man both mentally
and physically wheu in bis prime, and bo does
not yield readily to disease, but bis advanced
ago renders it diflicult for him to recover from
tho recent attack.
A Soldier' Men or "Fun."
IH'wl Ckrtter IUerd.
Wo have heard different versions of what
constituted fun, but wo beard a new ono tho
other day from an old soldier. At Gettysburg
about tbo time of Pickolt's charge the relator
was stationed down toward tbe odgo of tho
Whoatfleld, and ho was sent ont with a squad
to rcliovo tho picket in acopeeof woods. Meet
ing tho Sergeant ho was about to relieve, ho
asked him what his orders wore. Ho was In
formed, and among other things tho pickets
wore not to Are. " Why," said tho relieving Ser
geant " they are firing right now. Why don't
you stop them?" "Oh, wo! I, thoy aro just
having a littlo fun In there. Tho rebels havo
got possossion of a stretch of stono wall and
our boys swear they aro going to take it away
from them." Our informant went iu, and soon
he aud his men wore as deep iu tho "fun" us
their prodocassors, notwithstanding their or
ders not to Are. They kept it up, dodging
behind trees and working aronnd tho woods
until they got a flank flro, ran in ou tbo stono
wall, and captured it. Thoy had their fun aud
accomplished their object.

Hoped Into a Bad Bet
Detroit Free Press.
A Detroiter who deals in real estato, law in
surance, loans, lawsuits, politics, etc., went ovor
to Chicago tbe other day. While nearing that
city a man came to him and confidentially
remarked :
"There's a chap in tho car back there trying
to get a $20 bill changed. It's a baso counter
feit, and I want to put you on your guard."
Ho was warmly thanked for his kindness
and passed on, aud livo minutoa later a man
appeared with c bill in bis hand and asked:
"Friend, can you chango this twenty?"
"Sorry to say 1 can't," was tho prompt reply.
" Well, let mo havo ten aud you keep tbo bill
until wo get to Chicago."
"Can't do it."
"Can't you let me havo five? "
" No."
"Porbaps yon aro afraid of the bill. I don't
claim to know much about money. Is it good
or bad?"
"It's a counterfeit."
"No!"
"I'm sure of It"
" It can't be. I'll bet tbe face valuo of it that
it Is a good bill. Loud me $3 on It, won't
you?"
"No sir, but I'll take that bet of youra that
the conductor won't accopt it an good."
"Well, it will bo worth $20 to find out about
it," said tbo stranger, and ott they went to tbo
conductor.
"Givo mo two tons for thi3?" brnsqnely
queried tbo strangor,ns ho banded out the bill.
"If I can," replied tbo conductor, scarcely
glancing at it.
Ho mado out a ten and two fives and passed
them ovor, and tbo Detroiter banded over tbo
amount of his bet, kicked himself into the noxt
car, and ho never flaw a bit of Lake Michigan
as the train mado its wuy into Chicago

A'. Y. Tribune.
This Btory Is told of Daniel Lockwood, Con-grcssraan-clcct
from Huflhlo: When a school
boy bo was chosen valedictorian of his class.
Uo propnrcd for tho event by ordering a new
pair of shoes. Late in the afternoon of tbo
great day tho shoes camo. But, good heavens 1
they wouldn't go on. Dan hadn't anotltor pair
lit to use. Ho summoned tho sboumtiker to n
conference, and, whilo tbe perspiration rolled
off bis face, he explained the situation. "That's
nothing," said Crispin ; " got a couple of eggs
and break ono In each shoe." Dan did so, und
tho result was charming. Ho went into tho'ie
shoes liko a dock's foot in tho mud. His vale
dictory was the greatest eflbrt of Lock wood '3
career up to that date. Tho words were honeyed
aud thu gestures wuro graceful as a snake
swallowing a frog. All bis friouds and relatives
wero spellbound. But right in tho midst of it
the author stopped. Agony was incarnate in
his features. His hair mu on end. Ho bc
camo palo and red by turn. What was tho
matter? Had he forgotten his speech? No. No,
he had just thought of those two egg otnolots,
and would havo given up all he had or ever
hoped to have for a chance to laugh.
