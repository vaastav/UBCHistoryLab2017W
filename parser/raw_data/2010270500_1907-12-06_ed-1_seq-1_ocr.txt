big and the people' too sensible to
allow the ucts'of a few men to shak-s
their faith In the integrity of our great
financiers and business men as a

The striking scenes of the day were
In the house of representatives, where
the formal selection of Joseph O. Can
non again to be speaker of that body
and tho designation by the Democrats
of Mr. John Sharp Vll'lams as their
leader were occasions for dVallons for
those gentlemen. The vast hall of tho
house of representatives rang with tho
cheers of Republicans and Democrat!!
for their leaders. The presence of Hon.
AV. J. Bryan on tho house floor als
was the occasion for enthusiastic
cheering by tho Democrats.
When the adoption of rules for the

Sixtieth congress came un tho ruhM
of the last congress were opposed by
John Sharp Williams, and he was
Joined In the opposition by Democrats
and by a single Republican. Mr.
Cooper, of Wisconsin. The old rule

of the speaker, but after a somewhat,
acrimonious discussion they wero
adopted by a party vote. ,
Committees were appointed by both
houses to Inform the president that
cohgrcss had met and was ready to
receive any message he might wlsn
to communicate.

FRANCE IS COLD TO THE STORK
Alc.rnilng Decrease Is Shown In the
Willi Rate.
A decreased birth rate In France In
1906, the lowest In fact, in her history,
Is shown In statistics Just published
by the official J lurnal of the republic,
Recent yc-vo have been marked by a
steady decline In the number of births,
The aver.i ;o yearly rate from 1896 t
1905 v.as 839,843. In 1908 the birth
fell to 806,847. The deaths during the
year aggregated 780,190.
Dr. Jaequez Bertillon, statistician o
Paris, takes a pessimistic view of thl
showing. He points out that whereas
all of France's neighbors yearly In
crease in population France's popula
lion is at 'a stanstill. So he think
the tide of her population may fall
backward.

OS MORE PAT TO MEH
Snforctd Service Faces American
People, Declares Adjutant
General Ainsworth.
Unless radical measures are enacted
to Induce mon to enlist In the United
States army, conscription must be re
sorted to, declares Major General P. C
Ainsworth, adjutant general, in his an
nual report.
"Notwithstanding the most strenuous
efforts on the part of the War Depart
ment and the recrultlug officers." says
General Ainsworth, "It has been found
Impossible wholly -to make good the
losses, to sny nothing of Increasing the
enlisted strength to the authorized lim
it. If present conditions continue there
will bo nothing for the government to
do but meet this competition by mate
rially Increasing the soldiers' pay or
to evade competition altogether by a
resort to conscription."
Never before has such a suggestion
i-ouio from an ofllcer clothed with the
authority to make recommendations.
The Idea of compulsory enrollment of
Individuals for the military service ba
been held abhorrent to republican prin
ciples and the absence of such a law
Is one of the most forceful arguments
used In attracting desirable immigra
tion from Europe.
Oflicials of the War Department at
tlclpate that the possible necessity foi
such action outlined by General Ains
worth will prove efficacious In secni'lng
consideration by Congress of the In-t-tcaac
of pay bill. It Is with the great
est, reluctance that army officers enter
tain the thought of conscription, but
generally they agree with General
Ainsworth that it either must come to
that extremity or more money must
be provided for the soldier If the stand
ing of the army Is to be maintained.

experiment of uslug tho Yaqul Indians
to fight the Mayas. The uprising of
the Maya Indians against federal au
thority begun several months ago, and
It hus spread until practically all the
mcmlicrs of that tribe are now In arm
ed rebellion. The Ynqul Indians, like
the Mayas, are waging a bloody con
flict ngulust tho government troops,
and upon tho peaceful settlers of their
territory In the Stat of gouoro. The
government hns been trying for several
yenrs to put down the Ynqul rebellion.
It has succeeded In largely decreasing
the force of Indlaus by capturing hun
dreds of them and deporting them to
the QuhJtantt Uoo territory, In what
was formerly Yucatan. Tbo Muya In
dians formerly occupied all of what Is
now culled Qulntana Roo. They were
brought under temporary subjection
about 19 yeurs ago, and the new terri
tory wus created by tho government
and wus opened up for settlement. The
Mayas soon went on the war path
again, and there has been 110 settle
ment of the territory thnt was former
ly occupied by them. The government
soldiers have had all that they could
do to keep the territory from being re
taken by the Mayas.
Tho Maya Indians have been making
such an Incessant warfare upon the
federal troops thut were sent against
them during the last few months that
the order wub given to augment the
forces of the Mexicans by organizing
the Yaquls who had been deported to
Qulntana Roo Into military companies.
It was believed that this experiment
of pitting tho Yaquls against the Mayas
would prove successful from tho fact
that the few peaceable Mayus who had
como Into contact with the Yuquls
seemed to show a natural hatred for
thut race of Indians.

Mr Oliver Lioage, tue notea tu-itma
scientist, has delivered another pro
nouncement on the subject of the im
mortality of the soul. He say first that
the simple important truth to be kept in
mgut is tne commonplace iuci inai mere
is nothing immortal or persistent about
the body except the material atoms of
which it is composed. He dismisses ut
terly the uotion, still taught by part of
the Christian church, that these atoms
will some day be gathered and reunited
so as to constitute a completo man as be
appeared on the earth, and who there
after will last forever. This he regards)
as merely a clumsy expedieat to make
pleasing the Idea of the homeless, wan
dering spirit or ghost of the departed in
dividual. Sir Oliver says that nobody
know what the soul U, but that com
mon sense rebels against its being noth
ing, and that no genuine scluace had as
sumed to declare It a purely imaginary
nonentity. He holds it must be acknowl
edged by science that no really existing
thing perishes, it only changes form. As
this has been shown clearly iu the caso
of matter and energy! it must also be
true of mind, consciousness, will, mem
ory, love and other activities which in
teract with matter and appeal to t be
bodily senses. These facts of the indi
vidual human consciousness, he says, can
not be retarded as nothing, and they will
never vnnlhli Into nothiusness. They did
nrise with us. They never sprang sud
denly iutu being from previous non-e.it-ence.
They are us eternal as the God-
hoait ltw.lf nnil u.'l! in Dternnl lieln? on.
