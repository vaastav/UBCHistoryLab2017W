THIN TALK ON OFFSETS.
Ih n't it a pretty thin argument in favor
of the abolition of offsets that ancs a step
will make the state richer a. a taxpaying
unit aud therefore tbst the public monies
for state, municipal and local purposes
can be raised easier T
Where is the gain coming from?
, Partly, no doubt, from those who have
returned dishonest, fictitious offsets.
Bach a fain, if it could .top there,
would be a real one and welcomed by
everybody. , "
But it goes further and include, as welt
everybody who owes anything, whether
an hbnest debt or not, and compels them
to pay taxea on the debt.
Such a gain Is not only a delusion but
a anare that will work the ruin of many
honest, hard-pressed debtors, now but
barely able to stazger along under their
burdens.
What of them?
Are they to be sacrificed in order to
catch a number believed to be small who
act dishonest lyT
Is there no other way of accomplishing
this except at .0 great a cost
Ba anything ever been tried or pro
posed with thia in view?
If not, why not attempt it before cut
ting off the dog', tail in the hope of cur
ing an nnsigbtly wart on it?
And when it ia glowingly represented
how the state and the town, .re to realize
(bonsanda of dollar, through this raise in
the grand list, Just spare a moment', con
sideration for the debt-ridden mortals
that have got to put np this raise.
A. aa in.tance of a Mate seeking to
lift itself by its own boot-straps, this
golden dream of prosperity to follow the
abolition of offset, deserves the pipe for
it', that kind of a dream.

Indicates that the primaries system dee
not mean th dawn of a political milleni

"Now thi. reveal, a condition that ia in
no way an Improvement over the present
caucus system. Indeed, it Is worse. In
stead of eliminating the man of wealth,
with hia mitliona to corrupt the elector
ate, it give, him a greater opportunity
and practioally preclude, the advent of a
poor man into the political arena.
Controverting the argument in favor of
a f 10,000 normal school, to be established
at Johnson, th St. Alban. Messenger j
ask. :
And are w now, in th light of mod
ern experience, with the ease and conven
ience of quick comparison with educa
tional standards in neighboring states, to
b asked to believe that a bar 140,000
will establish a model normal school for
Vermont a school that will be pattern
for all schools, a school where the stats
will teach teachers to teach under the in
fluence of everything that the times de
mands to render their inatrnction what it
ought to be?
A "bare f 40,000 " is of course a mere
bagatelle in such a scheme. Th state
may well pause to Inquire, "Is the game
worth the powder?"
A bill Is in to permit newspapers and
i railroad, to exchange advertising space
and mileage on a cash basis. This nsed to
be the custom, and nobody objected, but
with the passage of the railroad rate bill
of 1908 the companies cut it out, on the
ground that it wss not -permissible. The
state board of railroad commissioners ba.
never ruled on it, but were it to do so
there Is a probability that tb tribunal
would follow the precedent of the federal
commission and declare it contrary to the
intent of the law. Nobody .designed to
havfe the act of 1906 aa far-reaching as
this, and a bill to that effect ought to re
ceive favorable consideration. If passed,
it would doubtless mean the restoration
of the railroad time table, to the columns
i of the newspapers, whose absence for the
' past two years ba. been noted by the
; reading public, much of which has to de
1 pend on that agency for what it knows
as to the arrival and departure of trains.

Final Recommendations at
Roosevelt Regime.
Tbe following abstract of President
Roosevelt', final annual message to Con
gress lart week was prepared for the edi
torial columns of the Burlington Free
Press :
Inasmuch as th annual message sent
to Congress by President Boosevelt yes
terday is .the last document of this charac
ter which ba will iasu before retiring
from the Whit House unnsual interest at
taches to hi. utterances. It is distinctly
Roosevelt tan In character and what tbe
tndent ot affairs would expect. It lacks
something of th .aggressiveness along
new lines that bat characterized some of
tbe president's former message to the
legislative branch of our general govern
ment, but it i. nevertheless replete with
excellent recommendations.
President Roosevelt say. that our cur
rency system i. imperfect and it U earn
estly to be hoped tbe currency commis
sion will be able to propose a thoroughly
good svstem which will do away with th
existing defects. FromJolyt, 1K01, to
Seotember 80, 190S, the amount of
money in circulation increased by 902,
991,399. . Tb president believes it i worse than
folly to attempt to prohibit all corporate
combinations aa is done by tb Sherman
anti-trust law, and he favors a measure
that will expressly permit combinations
which are in the interest of the public,
subject to government control
The railwsTS of tba country should be
put complet-ly under the Interstate Com
merce commission and removed from the
domain of tbe ant i trust law.
Telegraph and telephone companies do
ing an interstate business sboold b put
under the jurisdiction of tb Interstate
Commerce commission.
Tb more fanigbted corporation, are
themselves coming to recognize tbe un
wisdom of Violent hortility they bav dis
played during the past few year, to regu
lation and control by tbe national gov
ernment. There should be regulation by the na
tional government of the great interstate
corporation!!. Including a simple method
of accoont keeping, publicity, aupervl
lion of tbe issue of securities, abolition of
rebate, and of special privileges.
There sboold be short time franchises
for all corporations engaged in pablio
business; including tbe corporations
which get power from water rifthts.
There shonld be national aa well a.
tat guardianship of mine and forests.
A tar aa possible a frank recognition of
the advantage, conferred by machinery,
organization and division ot labor, ac
companied by an effort to bring about
a larger share in the ownership by wage-
worker of railway, mill and factory. In
farming, thia simply means that w wish
to see tbe farmer own his own land; we do
not wish to se th farms so large that
tbey become tbe property of absentee land
lords who farm tbcm bv tenants, nor yet
so small that the farmer becomes like a
European peasant.
Postal savings banks will make it eay
tor tbe poorest to keep tbeir savings in
absolute safety.
The regulation of the national higb-
wavs most be such that they shall serve
all people with equal justice.
Corporate finance must be super
vised so as to make it far safer than at
present tor tbe man of small means jo In
vest bis mcfoey in stocks.
There must be prohibition of child la
bor, diminution of woman labor, shorten
ing of hours of all mechanical labor;
stock watering should be prohibited, and
stock gambling so far as poesible dis
couraged.
There should be a progressive inheri
tance tax on large fortune.
Industrial education should be encour
aged.
Aa tar aa possible w should lighten tb
burden of taxation on tb .mall man.
It i. eminently right that tbe nation
should fix the term, upon which the
great fortune, are inherited. They rare
ly do good and they often do harm to
those who inherit them ia their entirety.
Congress shonld provide ample protec
tion tor wag workers.
The Congress should without further
delay pas. a model employer.' liability
law for tb District of Columbia.
The president renews th recommenda
tion made in a previous message that
halt-holiday, he granted during summer
to all wageworker. in government em
ploy. The president also renew, the recom
mendation that tbe principle ot the eight
hour day should a. rapidly and as far as
practicable be extended to tbe entire
work being carried on by the government;
th present law should be amended to em-
brace contracts on those public works
which th present wording of the act
seem" to exclude.
Th president orgs open Congress the
duty of increasing the totally inadequate
salaries now given to oor judges saying
that beginning with tbe supreme court
tba judges should bav tbeir salaries
doubled.
He condemn, those labor leader, who
have violently assailed the judicial sys
tem. .
The forests of thi. country should be
saved and conserved.
Th Improvement ot inland railway, la
urged and the plan which is held to
promise the beet and quickest results is
that of a permanent commission author
ised to co-ordinate th work ot all the
government department, relating to wa
terways, and to tram and supervise the
execution ot a comprehensive plan.
The use ot denatured alcohol, a. in
tended, i. makiug a fair degree of prog
re, and is entitled to further encourage
ment and support from tbe Congress.
Tbe pur food legislation has already
worked a benefit difficult to overestimate
It baa been tb president's purpose
from tbe beginning of tbe present admin
istration to take tbe Indian service com
pletely out ot tbe atmosphere of political
activity, and there has been steady prog
ress toward that end.
Tbe president renew, hi. recommenda
tion, regarding an extension of tbe par
cel post oo the rural routes snd postal
saving, banks for depositing savings
with tbe security ot tbe government be
hind them.
The work of the Panama canal is being
done with a speed, efficiency and entire
devotion to duty which make it a model
for all work of the kind.
The nation's foreizn policy is based
on tbe theory that right must be done be
tween nations precisely as between indi
viduals, and in our action, for the la.t
ten years w have in thi matter proven
oar faith by our deeds. We have be
haved, and are behaving, towards other
nations, as In private life an honorable
man would behave, towards his fellows.
The president calls for a reorganization
of the army upon modern lines, particu
larly th cavalry arm. Now that th Na-

season was later shortened to ten d.r.
and still later to six. In spite of the
shortening of the season, more deer are
being killed every year, almost twice aa

If in th turning loose of seventeen
deer in the state, with prohibitive shoot

years, it is possible to produce such I

close to 4000 deer, for it is safe to esti

Principlea and Platforms.
Tbe Vermont pres. i commenting vig
orously on "tbe extent to which the pres
ent legislature baa ignored party pledges
which were need to build a platform."
The moral of the matter hark, back to
tbe making of platforms. Tbe task of
writing a platform i. confided to some
well-known Republican, and thereafter
the main object of the convention seems
to be to get it out of the wsy ai soon as
possible. It listena with mora or less Im
patience to it. reading and the vote on its
adoption is wholly perfunctory. Full
and exhaustive debate on a platform or
any plank thereof i. something practical
ly unknown to the present generation of
delegates.
More time and thought ought to be
riven to the declaration of principle.
ids fact is too obvious to require argu
ment. We have, however, seen a. yet no
suggestion in a practical way looking to
reform.
A practical method, it seems to os,
would be to require that tbe proposed
platform be printed in advance) which
would be easy, since it is, or could be.
fnllv campleted the night before tbe con
vent ion and tbe slips passed around to
tba delegate. Then every one would
know just what tbe convention waa ex'
pet-ted to declare tor it ia almost impos
sible to learn tbis.'from merely hearing tbe
platform read and there would thus be
given opportunity for protest, if protest
were to be made, and at any rate there
would be a besi. for debate.
Tne developments of th present year
ought certainly to compel the abandon
ment ot tbe present system forever.
