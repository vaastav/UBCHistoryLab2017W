increased and aosolute peril seemed
at hand. In thro circumstances

the government was to some extsnt

were permhted to somewhat in

to the people the money lying idle
in the treasury served to avert im

the excess for the present year
amounting on the first day of De

to reach the sum of $113,000,000 on

it is expected that this sum added
to prior accumulation will swell
the surplus in the treasury to $140,

ubtraed from thev channels of
trads there seems to ye reason lor
the claim that some legitimate
means should be devised by the
government to restore in an
emenrencv, witnoui wasie or
extravagance, such money to
its place among the people.
It such an emergency arises there
now exists no clear and
undoubted axeculive power of relief.
Heretofore the redemption ot three
per cent bonds which were payable
utthe option of the government has
lorded a means oi tue uisourse-
meut of the excess ot our revenues,
but these bonds have all been retired
and there are no bonds outstanding,
the payment of which we have the
right to insist upon. The contribu
tion to the sinking fund which lur
niithed the occasion for the expendi
ture in the purchase of bonds has
been already made for the cuirent
year so thai there in no outlet in
that direction.
In the present state of legislation
the only pretence of any existing
power to restore at this time any
part ot our surplus revenues to tne
people by its expenditure consists
in the supposition that the Secretary
of the Treasury may enter the mar
ket and purchase the bonds ot tne
government not yet due at a rate of
premium to be agreed upon. The
only provision ot law irom wnicn
such a power could be derived is
found in an appropriation bill
passed a number of vera ago, and
it is subject to the suspicion that it
was intended as temporary and lim
ited in its application in-tead of
conterring a continuing discretion
and authority. iNo condition ought
to exist which would justify the
giant of power to a single official
upjll 1113 JUUfUICMI Ul HE licoailjl
to withold from or release to tne
business of the people in an unusual
manner money held in the Treasury
and thus affect at his will the finan
cial situation-of the country; and if
it is deemed wise to lodge in the
Secretary of the Treasury the au
thority in the present juncture to
purchase bonds it should be plainly
vsted and provided as far as possi
ble with such checks and limita
tions a will defint this official's
right and disnetion and at the
same time relieve him from undue
responsibility.
In consideration of tha question
of purchasing bonds as a means of
restoring to circulation the surplus
money accumulating in the Treas
ure it should be borne in mind that
premiums mus t be paid for such
purchase; that thra may be a large
part of these bonds as investments
which cannot be purchased at any
price, andjthat combinations among
holders who are willing to sell may
unreasonably enhance ths cost of
such bonds to the government. It
lias been suggested that tha present
t.onded debt night ba refunded at
a less rate of interest and the differ
ence between the old and the new
securities and cash thus finding use
for the surplus in the Treasury.
The success of this plan it is appar-v
ent must depend upon tho volition
ol the holders of the present bonds,
and is is not entirely certain that
the inducement which must be of
fered would result in more finan
cial benefit to the government than
the purchase of bonds, while the
latter proposition wpuld reduce the
principal of tb debt by actual pay
ment, instead of extending the
proposition to deposit the money
held by the government in bonds
throughout the country for use by
the people, as it seems to me exceedingly-
otjectiona'ola in principle as
establishing too close a relationship
between the operations of the gov
ernment (Treasury, and the busi
ness of the country, and too exten
sive a collection of their money, thus
fostering an unnatural reliance in
private busin-.-ss on public funds,
if this scheme should be adopted
it should only be done as a tempo
rary expedient to meet an urgent
necessity. Legislative and execu
tive effort should generally be in
the opposite direction and should
have a tendency to divert as much
and as fast as can safely be done
tne Treasury Department from
private enterprises. Of course it is
not expected that unnecessary and
extravagant appropriations will lie
made for the purpose of avoiding
the Accumulation of an excess of
revenue. Such expenditures, beside
the demoralization of all just con
ceptions of public duty which it en
tails stimulates a habit of reckless
improvidence not in the least con
sistent with the mission of our peo
pie or the high and beneficent pur
poses of our government. I have
deemed it my duty to thus bring to
the knowledge of my countrymen
as well as to the attention of their
representatives charged with the
responsibility of legislative relief the
gravity of our financial situation, the
failure ot Congress heretofore to
provide against the dangers whieb
it was quite evident the very nature
oi the difficulty must necessarily
produce causing a condition of finan
cial distress and apprehension since
your last adjournment which taxed
tothe utmost all the authority

wrousr, to the people as well as pan I
fo.the country, it ja but a r-suit
growing oj' c' s. perieetly pafpaoi -and
apparen'. cause, constantly re
producing the same alarming cir
cums'ances, a congested national
treasury and a depleted monetary
condition fh the business of the
country. It need hardly be stated
that while the present situation de
mands a remedy we can only be
saved from a like predicament in
the future by the removal ot its
cause. Our scheme of taxation by
mean.s of which this needless sur
plus is taken from the people and
put into the public treaury consists
of a tariff or duty levied upon im
portations from abroad, and Inter
nal Revenue taxes levied upon the
consumption of tobacco and spirit
uous and malt liquors.
It must be conceded that none of
the things subjected to infernal
revenue taxation are strictly speak
ing necessaries. There appears to
be no just complaint to the tax
bv the consumers of these articles
and there seems to be nothing so
well able to bear the burden with
out hardship to any portion of the
people. But our present tariff laws,
the yic'ous inequitable and illogi
cal source of unnecessary taxation,
ought to be at once revised and
amended. These laws in their pri
mary and plain effect raiie the price
to consumers of all articles import
ed and subject to duty by precisely
the sum paid for such duties; thus
the amount of the duty measures
the tax paid by those who purchase
for use these important articles.
Many of these things, however, are
raised or manufactured in our own
country and the duties now levied
upon foreign goods and products
are caded protective to those same
manufactures because they render
it possiible for th -se of our people
who are manufacturers to make
these taxed articles and sell them
for a price equal lor that demanded
for the imported good that have
paid customs duty. So it happens
that while comparitively a few use
the imported articles, millions of
our people who never use and never
saw any of the foreign products
purchase and use things of the
same kind made in this country and
pay, therefore, nearly or quite the
same enhanced price which the duty
adds to the imported articles. Those
who buy the imported pay the duty
charged thereon in the public
Treasury, but the great majority of
our citizens who buy domestic ar
ticles of the same class pay a sum
at least approximately equal to this
duty of the home manufacturer.
This reference to the operation of
our tariff laws is not mads by way
of instructions, but in order that wc
may be constantly reminded of the
manner in which they impose a
burden upon those who consume
domestic products as well as those
whe consume imported articles and
thus create a taxation on all of our
people.
it is not propossd to entirely re
lieve the country of this taxation.
It must be extensively continued as
the source of the government's in -
come and in a readjustment of our
tariff the interests oi American la
bor engaged in manufacturing
should be carefully considered as
well as the protection of our manu
facturers. It may be called protec
tion or by any other name but re
lief from the hardship and dangers
of our present tariff law should be
devised with reference to providing
against the imperilling the .exist
ence of our manufacturing interests;
but thi3 existence should not
mean condition which without
regard to the public welfare or
a national exegeucy must
always insure the realizition of
immense profits instead of moder
ately profitable returns. As the
volume and diversity ol our nation
al activities iticiase new retruits
are added to those who desire a con
tinuation of the advantages viuch
they conceive the present system of
tariff taxation directly affords then.
Stubbornly have all efforts to re
form the present condition been re
sisted by those of our fellow citizens
thuseagaged that they can hardly
complain of the suspicion enter
tained to a certain extent that there
exists an organized combination all
along the line to maintain their ad"
vantage.
We are in tke midst of centennial
celebrations and with becoming
pride we rejoice in American inge
nuity and American energy and en
terprise and in the wonderful natu
ral advantages and resources devel
oped by a century a national growth.
Yet when an attempt is made to
justify a scheme which prescribes a
tax to be laid uDon every.1 consum
er in the land for the bedefit ol our
manufacturers quite beyond, a rea
sonable demand for governmental
regard it suits the purpose of the
advocates to call our manufactures
infant industries still needing the
highest and greatest degree of favor
and festering car of Federal 'legis
lation It is also said that the in
crease in the price of domestic man
ufactures resu'ting from the present
tariff is necessary in order that
higher wages may be paid to our
workingmen employed in manu
factures than is paid for what is
called the pauper labor of Europe.
All will acknowledge th force of
argument which involves ihe wel
fare and liberal co up jnst ion (if our

The f'audard of ourl.d rvs should
not be measurer by t"fi;itof any
other country less favored d they

our advantages.
By the last census it is made to
appear that of the 17,392,009 ot our
population engaged in all kinds of
industries 7,b, 0,49 i are employed in
agriculture, 4 074,238,in professional
and personal service, 2,934.876 of
whom are domestic servants and
laborers, while 1,810,256 are em
ployed in trade and transportation,
and 3,837,112 are cls ed as em
ployed in ma'nufactaring and min
ing. For present purposes, how
ever, the last number given should
be considerably reduced without
attemptfng to enumerate all. It
will be conceded that there should
be deducted from those which if
excludes 375.141 carpenters and
joiners, 2S5,401 milliners, dressmak
ers aim seamstresses, l2,2b black
smiths, 133,756 tailors aud tailor

and 4,891 engaged in manufacturing
agricultural implements, an trgpe
gate of 1,214,023, leaving 2,623,089
persons emp.oyed in such manu
facturing industries as are claimed
to ba benefitted by high tariff.
To these the appeal is made to
s-re , their employment and main
tain their wages by resisting a
cnange. lhere should be no dispo
sition to answer such suggestion by
the allegation ttial they are in a mi
nority among those who labor and
therefore should forego an advan
tage in the interest of low prices for
the majority. Their compensation.
as it may be affected by the opera
tion ol tariff laws, should at all
times be scrupulously Aiept in view;
and yet with slight reflection they
will not overlook the fact that they
are consumers with the rest, that
they too have their own wants and
thc.se of their families to supply
from their earnings, and that the
price of the necessaries of life, as
well as the amount of their wages,
will regulate the measure of their
welfare and comfort. But the re
duction of taxation demanded
should be so measured as not to ne
cessitate or justify either the loss of
employment by the working man
nor the lessening of his wages, and
the profits still remaining to the
manufacture alter a necessary read
justment should furnish no excuse
for the sacrifice of the interests of
his employee, either in their oppor
tunity to work or the diminution of
their compensation. Nor can the
worker-s in manufactories fail to un
derstand that while a high tariff is
c'aimed to be necessary to allow the
payment of remunerative wages it
certainly results in a very lare in
crease in the price of nearly all sorts
of manufactures which in almost
countless forms he needs for the use
of himself and his family. He re
ceives at the desk of his employer
hia wages, and perhaps before he
reaches his home is obliged in a pur
chase for his family an article which
embraces his own labor to return in
the payment the increase in price
which the tariff permits the hard
earned compensation of many days
ot toil.. The farmer and the agri
culturist who manufacture nothing,
but who pay the increased price
which the tariff imposes upon every
agricultural implement, upon all he
uses aud owns, except the increase
of his flocks and herds and such
things as his husbandry produces
from the soil, is invited to aid in
maintaining the prcse.it situation;
and he is told that a higii duty on
imported wool is necessary for the
benefit of those who have sheep
to shear in order that the price
of their wool may be increased.
Thev of course are not reminded that
the farmer who has no sheep is by
this scheme obliged in his purchases
of clo.hing and woolen goods to pay
a tribute to his fellow-farmer as well
as to the manufacturer and merchant,
nor is any mention made of the fact
that sheep owners themselves and
their households must wear clothing
and use other articles manufactured
from the wool they tell at tariff rates
and thns as consumers will return a
share of the increased priceto the
tradesmen. 1 think it may be fairly
assumed that a large proportion of
the sheep owned by the farmers
throughout the country are found in
small nocks numbering from 2o to 50
The duty on the grade of imported
wool which these sheep yield is ten
cents each per pound. If the hbe ai
estimate of six pounds be allowed for
each fleece the duty thereon would be
62 or 72 cento, and this may be taken
as the utmost enhancement of the
price to the farmer by reason of this
auty. Eighteen dollars would thus
represent the increased price of the
wool of 25 sheep and thirty-six dol
lars that from the wool of 50 sheep,
and at present value this addition
would amount to about one-third its
price. If upon its sale the farmer
received this or a less tariff profit the
wool would leave his hands-' charged
with precisely that sum which in all
its changes will adhere to it until it
reaches the consumer. When manu
factured into cloth and other material
for use its cost is not only increased
to tha extent of the farmer's tariff
profit but a further sum has been
added for the benefit of the manufac
turer under the operation of other
tari.t la.vs. In the meantime the dav
arrives when the farmer fiuds t ne -
essa 3- to purchase woolen clothes aud
material to clothe himself and family
for the winter. When he fac?3 the
trad sman for that purpose he discov
ers that he is obliged not only to re
turn in the way of increased prices
uis laiiu prone on ine wool, ne sold,
and which then lies' before him in
manufactured form, but that he must
add a considerable sum thereto to
meet a further increase in cost caused
by a tariff duty on the manufacture.
Thus in the end he is aroused to
the fact that he h ;s paid upon a mod
erate purchase as a r -sult of the tar
iff scheme which when he sold his wool
seemed so profitable an increase in
price more than sufficient to sweep
away all tha tariff profit he received
upon the wool he produced and sold.
When the number of farmers engag
ed in wool raising, is Compared with
all the farmers in the country and the
small proportion they bear to our
population is considered, when it is
made apparam. that in the case o-' a
large part of those who own sheep the
benefit of the present tariff on wool
is illusory, and above all when it
must be conceded that the increase of
the cost of liviug caused by such tar
iff bear the burden upon those with
moderate means anil tha poor, the
employed and the unemployed, the
sick and the well, be young and the
old, aud that it constitutes a tax which
with relentless grasp is fastened upon
the clothing of everv man, woman and
child in the land, reasons are suggest
ed why the removal or reduction of
this duty should be included in a re
vision of our tariff laws. In speaking
of the increas d cost to the consumer
of our home manufactures resulting
from a duly laid upon imported ar
ticles of the same description the fact .
13 not overlooked that competiti . n
among our domestic producers some
times has tube effect of keeping the
price of their products below the high
est limit allowed by such duty. But
it is notorious that: thia competition
is too strongly exemplified by combi
nations quite prevalent at this tiaie,
and frequent y called "trusts," which
have for their obj ct tue regulation of
the supply and price of the i ominodi
ties made and sold by members of the
combinations. The people ean hardly
hope for anv consideration in tha op
eration of these selfish schemes. If,
however, in the ab euce of such com
bination a healthv and free comnen-
sation raises the price of any parti u-j
lar dutiable article of home produc
tion below the limit which it might
otherwise reach under our tariff laws
and if with such reduced price its
manufacture continues to thrive, it is
entirely evident that one thing has
been discovered which should be fully-
scrutinized in an effort to reduce tax
ation. The necessity of combination
to m.intain and for. e the commodity
to the tariff point furnishes proof that
some one is bound to accept lower
prices for such commodity, aud that
prices are remunerative at lower
prices produced by a number of com
panies prove the same thing. Thus
there are those conditions which
would seem to be presented for an
easy reduction of taxation. The con
siderations which have been presented
touching our tariff laws are intended
only to enforce an earnest commend
ation that the surplus revenues of the
government be prevented by the re
duction of our customs duties and at
the s-ame time to emphasize a sugges
tion that in accompdshing this pur
pose we may discharge a double duty
to our people by granting to them a
measure of relief from tariff taxation
in quarters where it is most needed
and from sources where it can be more
fairly and justly accorded. Nor can
the presentation made of such cousid
cration be with any degree Of fairness
regarded as evidence of unfriendli
ness toward any manufacturer's iuter-
terests or of any lack of appreciation
of the value of imports. These inter
es s constitute a leading and most sub
stantial element of our national great
ness, and furnish the proud proof of
our century's progress; but if in the
emergency that presses upon us our
manufacturers are asked to surrender
something lor the public good, and
to avert disaster, their patriotism asa
grateful recognition of the ad van t
ages already afforded should lead
them to a willing co-operation. JNo
denimd is made that they shall forego
all the benefits of governmental re
gard. But they cannot fail to be
admonished of their duty as well as
their enlightened self-interest and
safety when they are reminded of the
fact that financial panic and collapse,
to which the present condition lends,
affords greater shelter or protection
to our manufacturers than all other
important enterprises. Opportunity
for safe and deliberate reform is now
offered, and none of us should be un
mindful of a time when an abused
and initated people, heedless of
those who have resisted timelv and
reasonable relief, may insist upon a
radical and sweeping rectification of
their wrongs.
The difficulty attending a wise
aud fair revision of our tariff law is
not underestimated. It will re
quire on the part of the Congress
great labor aud care, aud especially
a Droau aud national contemnla
lion of the subject, and a patriotic
uisi-egaru ot such local and selfish
claims as are unreasonable aud
reckless of the welfare ot the entire
country. Under our present laws
more than 4,000 articles are sub
ject to duty. Many of these do not
in any way compete with our own
manufacturers, aud many are
hardly worth attention, as subjects
of revenue. considerable reduc
tion can be made in the aggregate
by adding Ihe.ii to the free list.
The taxation of luxuries is no ini
position of hardship, but the neces
saries of life, used and consumed
by all tho people, the duty upon
which adds to the cost of living in
every home, should be greatly
cheapened." The radical i-cfluction
of the duties imposed upon- raw
material used in manufactures, or
its l'ree importation, is, of course,
an important factor in any effort
to reduce tho price of these neces
saries. It would not only relieve
them from the increased cost
caused by the tariff on such ma
terial, but the manufactured pro
duct being thus cheapened thatpai t
of the tariff now laid upon such pro
duct as compensation to our manu
facturers for the present price of
raw material could be accordingly
modilied. Such reductions or lice
importations would serve, besides,
to 'argely reduce the revenue. It
is net apparent how soon a change
can have any injurious effect upon
our manufacturers. On the con
trary, it would appear to give them
a better chance in foreign markets
with tho manufacturers of other
countries, who cheapen theirs bv
free material. Thus our people
might have the opportunity of ex
tending their sales beyond the lim
its of home consumption, saving
them from the depression, inter
ruption in business and loss caused
by a glutted market, and affording
their employees more certain and
steady labor, with its resulting
quiet and contentment. The ques
tion thus imperatively presented
for solution should be approached
n a spirit higher than partisan
ship, and considered bi the light of
that regard tor patriotic duty which
should characterize the actions of
those intrusted with the weal of a
confiding people.
But the obligation to declared
party policy and principlo is not
wanting to urge pionipt and ef
fective action. Both of the great
political parties now represented in
the government have, by. repeated
and authoritative declarations con
demned the condition of our laws,
which permit the collection from
tho people of unnecessary revenue,
and have in the most solemn man
ner promised its correction; and
neither as citizens or partisans are
our countrymen in a mood to con
done the deliberate violation of
these pledges.
Our progress to-ward a wise con
clusion will not be improved by
dwelling on t lie theories of protec
tion aud free trade. This savors
too much ol bandying of epithets.
Its condition will confront us not
as a theory. The relief from this
condition may improve as a light,
reduction of tiie advantages which
award our home productions by an
entire withdrawal. Some advan
tages should not be contemplated.
The question of free trade is ab
solutely irrelevant, and the persist
ent claim made in certain quarters
that all efforts to relievo the people
from unjust and unnecessary taxa
tion are schemes of so-called lree
traders, is mischevious, and far
removed from any consideration of
the public good.
The simple and plain duty which
wc owe the people is to reduce tax
ation to the necessary expenses of
an economical operation of the gov
ernment, and to restore to the bus
iness of the country the money
which we hold in tho treasury,
through the exercise of govern
mental powers.
These things can antl should be
done, with safety to all our indus
tries, without danger to the oppor
tunity for remunerative labor which
our workingmen need, and with
benefit to them aud all our people
by cheapening their means ol sub
sistence and increasing the meas
ure ot their comforts.
The constitution provides that
the President shall, from time to
time, give to the Congress informa
tion of the state of the Union. It
has been the custom of the execu
tive, iu compliance with this pro
vision, to annually exhibit to the
Congress, at ths opening of its
session, the general condition of
the country, and to detail with
some particulars the operations ol'
the ditierent executive depart
ments. It would be especially
agreable to follow this course at
the present time, and to call atten
tion to the valuable accomplish
ments of these departments during
the last fiscal year. But I am so
much impressed with the para
mount importance of the subject to
which this communication has thus
far beeu devoted, that I shall fore
go the addition of any other topic,
and only urge upon your immediate
consideration the state of the
Union as shown iu the prnsent
condition of our treasury, and our
general fiscal situation, upon which
every element of our safety and
prosperity depends.

departments which will be submit

and such recommendations relating

I ask that these renortannrl

branches of the government.
There are other subjects not em

submit. Some of them. liowvr.
