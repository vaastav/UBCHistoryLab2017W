The coming year will witness another
j. v. m ... ,
fmport&nt ora in the history of tha Amcr
. ican people. No less important duty de
volves on the people of tho United States
i .than that of selecting a Chief Magistrate
. for this country. The doings of the 'pres.
' ant administration must, within the next
twelve months be passed upon by the peo
ple and their verdict at the ballot .. box
... most settle the future policy of the gov-
ernment for the next four years as to
"'' many questions of national importance.
'" The reoent elections have settled one ques
lion even in the minda- of the Democracy.
J The next President will be a Republican ;
.' and the only issue in the coming cara-
eign will be whether a Republican of the
" Grant School will be chosen or one of that
milder type known as Conservative or
' moderate.
The Democracy arc loud in their com
plain tJ of what they term the de-potism
' -exercised by the present administration
toward tho people of the South, and yet,
nntil within a few months, there has been
; but very little interference n tht part of
the General Government in the affairs of
the South. As a general thing they hare
been allowed to manage their domestic
.- affairs after their own fashion, and not un
til their State Governments had proved a
failure and a farce did the Federal Au
thorities ioterfero.
Any Government is a failure tbat does
, Bet prevido ample protection to its hum
blest citiien in the exercise of the rights
guaranteed him by the Constitution. This
is what the the Southern - State .Govern
ment have failed to do. WLere the
United States authorities have found suffi
eient cause to warrant the arrest of hun
dreds of confessed malefactor?, and even
to suspend the writ of hateat con-vs the
States themselves have never deemed it
. necessary to interfere in any way or to
v autse the arrest of a single individual.
' These faots are well known to the great
'. mass of the people and their response in
. she Lite elections may safely be taken as a
- signal of approval of the course adopted
' by the administration.
The South has done itself great injury
u by permitting these acts of . lawlessness
which .have at last forcod the-. General
Gevernmewt into adopting strong tncas-
mres to suppress them?' and it has not only
' impared its own interests pecuniary as
. well as every other, but it has ruined the
Democratic party, and blasted its last
i hep of obtaining control of tho coun-
i try, ;
. " We can see nothing now to prevent the
election of a Republican for the next
President, and there is small room for
doubt that Grant will be the roan.
gantio rebellion and ' the K despotism to
which it gave birth, and the brilliant suc
cesses of hia policy in restoring power and
permanence to a victorious government,
can never be forgotten.' whilst their hearts
are stirred with chagrin of defeat. There
fore, they now propose a capitulation with
the disaffected - Republicans who oppose
the President because they can not turn
him to their own account. This must
provo another defeat in their fast filling
chapter of failures. These sore headed
Republicans are too wise to venture upon
a plan that will prove their own political
death-warrant, and too honest and sincere
in their party devotion to enter into a co
alition, having for its object the reascen
dency of the Democratic party. ' As we
have , frequently stated before, they are
committed by' many pledges, to the sup
port of the nominee of the National Re
publican Convention. Ichabod is written
in flaming characters upoa the Democratic
castle. Its runious career is closed..
Wrong, corruption, tyrranny and treason
have sealed its doom. "The Government

Terrible Affair at Spring Hill.'
- A special dispatch to tho Nashville
Banner says :
. . Spring Hill, December 1, 1871 .
A most lamentable occurence took place
here yesterday, which came near terminat
ing in a terrible tragedy and which has
occasioned no little excitement in Spring
Hill and viciuity.
J. L. McKissack. a member of one of
the oldest and most respeac table. families
of Maury County, during a temporary fit
of insanity yesterday, attempted to take
the life of his mother, his two sisters and
a young child. , '
It appears that some time ago he had,
in self-defense killed a negro, and since
that time his friends declare he has been
laboring under great mental distress,
from having heard a preacher recently say,
taking his text from Judges, " no man
who shed another's blood, whatever the
circumstances of the act, could possibly
hope for salvation."
This sermon and these particular words
seemed to have gravely impressed him at
the moment, and it was poon thereafter
observed that his mind was affected. .Yet
while he was known to be insane, he was
believed to be harmlss, and no effort was
made to restrain his movements.
Yesterday morning ns his sister, Mis T.
O. McKissack, was going down stairs with
his own child in her arms, he crept steal
thily "upon her from behind and struck her
a fearful blow on the head with a hatchet,
felling her to the floor. . Passing over her
prostrate form, as it lay in a pool of blood.
ho weut into his mother's room, finding
her there sprang upon her with the fury of
a madman, and cut her with the hatchet,
inflicting three different wounds, one
wound in the head, leaving a dangerous
rupture. Rut for the almost superhuman
efforts of Mrs. Robert J. Moore, (another
sister of McKissacks), who happened to
be iu the room at the time, and who, with
marvellous prnce of mind, realized the
situation of affairs and came to the rescue,
there is no doubt but that Mrs. McKissack
would hae been killed.
Mrs. Moore engaged in a desperate
struggle with him, during which he gashed
ner wun lue naccnet under tue lett ear,
but she finally wrested, it from him by
main force. Ho then drew a razor from
his pocket and cut himself badly in the
left side, though looking at himself in a
mirror while doing so, after which he rush
ed out into the street, made a deep cut in
the other side, though by this juncture
bw father and brother cmc up and rescued
him from himself. He cried out wildly
that he had killed them all at home, but
could . not explain the frantic impulse
which had induced him to do the deed
He now l'es in a critical condition.' Dr
White, the attending physician, thinks
Irs. KcMiseack, his mother, and Miss T,
O. McKissack, his sister, may possibly re
cover.' ' ':-( ' ' '' - " ' ' ' "

question the President says that the inex

lie says that it was impossible for him,
with self respect, or with a just regard to
the dignity of the nation, to permit Mr.
Catacazy to continue to hold intercourse
with this Government, after his personal
abuse of Government officials, and after
his improper i interference by various

Brussels, November 30. To day
being one of the fete days of the Com
munists, trouble was anticipated, and
extraordinary, precautions were taken
by the authorities to prevent danger
ous demonstrations in the present - ex
cited condition of the city.' The bur
gomaster issued a proclamation in the
morning enjoining all good ' citizens to
remain in their dwellings, - anf'; forbid
ding out door demor.strationsT'and de
claring that illegal assemblages would
be dispersed. : ' Nevertheless, "in "the
course ofthe day,: the recent distur
bances were renewed, - A - monster
crowd of men of opposite political par-
tie& collected in the streets, and there
were indications of trouble.' The 'pol
ice seemed to be unable or unwilling to
disperse' the rioters. - In one instance
a company of civic guards, sixty strong
were ordered to charge 'upon thepep
nlt;. but -thy reversed their muskets
and refused to "obey. The disorder
der continues. ' "ilob! hold possession
of the ' streets, and' the excitement is
intense. - -!'":''-n f
' Madrid, December 2.-The Council
members were se.ssio the. greater
part of yesterday and did ' not adjourn
until a . late v hour of the night. The
question of greatest importance grow-.
ing out ot the recent executions 10 Ha
vana, and the general condition of Cu
ba were under consideration. . It is re
ported that the Minister of Fpreign. Af
fairs was advised that the Governments
ofthe 'United States and Great Bri
tain telegraphed to their represenatives
at Madrid that they shpuld . feel. Coro
pclled 'to intervene, iu the interest of
humanity, since the efforts of the Span
ish anthorities'to restore, order proved
froities:; ; ;;;;
" Altbbughthe officials refuse to give
inlorniationit is certain that a crisis
has arisen in. connection with Cuban
affairs, which the Cabinet was n?eeial-
Counolly, it is stated, cried like a
child when taken to jail. lie has pri
vate apartments there. lie lacks
5400.000 of bail. Several friends call
ed esterdav. but none went the ne
cessary bonds. ; !
Charles O'Conor declines defending
the South Carolina Ku-klux.
In consequeuce of the assaults and
threats against the principal of the
school at Llunter's Point, by the Cath
olics, the respectable citizens have
formed a committee to protect him
and the school. Yesterday one of the
trustees demanded the keys Jof the
school and of the teachers desks from
the principal. He received them and.
it is believed that be intends' to close
the building. . j
"A prominent Cuban here states, that
10,000 stand of arms recently landed,
in Cuba 'safely, reaching the revolu
tionists. .; - . . ii -. u..
Alexis after inspecting West Point
Acadamy,' returned here ths after
noon.
Ex-Comptr611er: Connolly is begining
to' despair of - securing bail, "and, the
Sheriff thinks there is no possibility of
such a thing.
Three of Tweed's bondsmen signified'
their intontion to withdraw their names
from the bond if others were not se-.
cured. lie will share the fate of -Connolly.
, p'
-, Mayor Hall . has not been arrested.
and the sheriff- denies the receipt of
any papers in connection therewith or
any knowledge of the issuance of an
order ofarrest. -Tho Mayor stated
to-day that' hc'.bad jjot 'been' officially
notified of the action ot the Committee
of Seventy, and declined to speak ton
the subject of his resignation.
TThe; Tribune of Wedftcsday'says :
"With" thanksgiving itseetrrsfit that'
there should be an end of Murphy.
We propose now to make it," and then
proceeds to publish some . three; Col
umns of documentary ovidence.-mainly
derived from files of, the War', Depart
ment, in reference to 'Mufphy''s army
contracts. . The evidence ..-which . has
recently come to light, it says, proves
him to be actually a defaulter' to the
Government to the amount of $1GO,000
This, with $00,000 loss on shoddy hats
furnished by him, makes ' Murphy ac
tually a defaltcr to the Government for
over $310,000.' The '.Tribune explains
that it has in every case published ev
idence against Murphy, not when it
thought it could have a political effect,
but when it could get it, and. presents
the evidence procured only the day be
fore his removal. It would not now be
published at all. but for tho official
etters of compliment, which makes ""it
ncumbent on it to defend what if has
heretofore said. ";; '
