mult so largely in disappointment. With eggs

that the way may be opened, if be has pointed It
out. to the eradication of so j:re-it a scourge.
THE MESSAGE.
With his African trip before him, only a few
months of his term In office left, and only a
short session of Congress in which to accom
plish anything, President Roosevelt in his mes
sage shows none of that weariness 'of public
life and desire to turn aside from its problems
which would be natural in any one of less
abounding energy. He is as voluminous as
ever. His Interest In social questions is. un
abated, and It extends just as far into the future
as it ever did. He does rot confine himsflf to
recommending the next steps . which he con
ceives to be necessary in carrying into effect
the n«*w spirit of democracy and adapting the
government to present day conditions, but pro
claims bis whole "social philosophy" in all its
length and breadth, perhaps to illustrate
whither it leads, so that no one may go with
him blindly, perhaps to contribute to the forma
tion of public opinion long in advance on ques
tion!! Tvhich will inevitably arise as time goes
br. but probably because tfie social revolution
that he discerns as the Inevitable concomitant
of the #^cnnomic "revolution" of which he
sposks and which has b^en taking place almost
unrealized interests htm profoundly, and be
cause b" hopes to shape it not only by his ad
ministration but also by his influence upon
public opinion lons afterward. Social changes
have the property of taking a powerful hold
upon the minds, hearts and imaginations of
those who witness them or take part in them,
and the President 1s one of the men to whom
they make a profound appeal. Th» great service
of his administration has been in calling public
attention to social questions and brinclng them
Into politics. His seal for them is as lively
as ever, find this freshness, after the lone and
wearying routine of office, with its inevitable
disappointments, its record of incomplete re
sults and Its testimony to the slowness of prog
ress and the magnitude of obstacles. Is a won
derful proof of mental, moral and physical
vigor.
In a message which, with only a few months
of the Presidential term left, goes bo far afield
in the discussion of social questions as to tell
the country that It will some time, though "not
at present,*' have to consider the question of old
as<» pensions, if 1? inevitable that much space
Bhouid be devoted to other subjects than those
of immediate Importance upon which specific
recommendations should be made. The Presi
dent discusses all his familiar topics in the
vein which regular and specinl messages for
the last seven years have made familiar. "I
can only repeat what 1 have already again and
again said In my messages to Congress,*' he
remarks in speaking of corporations. But If
he has suffered the penalties of repetition he
ha? also gained Its advantage?, and the profound
impression he has produced upon the country
measures the wisdom of bis course.
In this message he takes up the labor problem
again, rehearsing what in his judgment the
country at large should undertake for its social
betterment. Bnd recommending to Congress the
comparatively little which under our federal
system it. can do. He devotes considerable
space to tie courts, more perhaps than to any
other topic, except forestry, advisinz an increase
In judges' salaries and the enactment of en
injunction law In harmony with the Chicago
platform, but really giving chief attention to
the part the courts should play in wisely mould
ing the socinl changes which he sees coming a
subject on which, of course, recommendations
Bre Impotable. All of questions he discusses
are of real and vital Importance, Many of
them will, doubtless, remain unsettled when
President Tnffs administration is over. They
will, however, have to be dealt with some day.
and Mr. Roosevelt's prevision regarding them is
at least as valuable as that of any other man
in public life. while his method, which has
differed fmm that of his predecessors, has been
wonderfully useful In stimulating the forma
tion of Intelligent public opinion.
THE COUNTRY'S MILITARY NEEDS.
Tn what he says about the army and navy In
his last message I 'resident Roosevelt shows
how closely i ■•■ has studied their needs and how
firm his conviction hns grown that thorough
ness of preparation Is the best guarantee of
j>eace and security. His most important recom
mendation is that a General Staff be created for
the navy, a project long advocated by Th«»
Tribune. Otfier possibilities of Increasing the
efficiency of thai arm of tbe service have been
recognized and discussed by the President, but
this promises to t"" 1 more farreachlng in its in
fluence. tt alms to put at tbe disposal of the
department the* pio?« helpful advice to be se
cilred, a eon»umraatlon the more to be desired
since Mr. Xewbeny's recently announced policy
looks to a concentration of responsibility not
hitherto obtained Whatever the fate of the
proposal may be, the President has done well
to put himself thus emphatically on record.
Two other specific recommendations for the
navy are highly commendable. Owing to the
failure of Congress to yield to tb«" President's
plen last winter for four battleships, there are
now Indications that within the next two years
the rank of this country among the naval pow
ers of the Trorld will 1>« inged.from the second
lo tbe Ihird place. i>u the principle of asking
for twice as much as he could expect from
the precedent last established, he might fairly
enough have recommended the construction of
eight vessels la the next instalment, instead of
only four. The advice concerning the first class
in the Annapolis Academy that Its members
should have experience in command before grad
uation, and that the capacity tint* tested should
count In determining their final standing — la
wise and practical
One of the suggestions now made In regard to
the army was offered in a previous message as
a means of heightening tin- efficiency of the
navy. Mr. Roosevelt favors such a system of
promotion and elimination combined as will ad
vance to the highest rank officers of the largest
usefulness. Precisely bow the plan sboajd be
worked out he leaves others to decide, and it
must be confessed that the adoption of any
■orfa measure would be attended with perplexi
ties, if not with hardships. Nevertheless, tbe
principle has much to- commend it.
The President advocates more elaborate pro
vision for familiarizing the national guard with
the duties of 'he regular army, for organizing
th«» volunteer f<irc« i s of ihe country In «ire
emerzeucies. for encouraging rifle practice ntid
making the soldier more of n fighting machine
«nd lees of a day laborer than he i= now. These
prbpofitionß reveal Dot only th» thoroughness
vith which the President iiae (scrutinized the

exietliyc resources of the nation, but n fadfctooi
forrsight as well.
THE FOREST
Nothing could have been more timriy Joan
the President's detailed and earnest rclercnce
in his message to the question of forest preser
ration. For weeks past some of the most im
portant regions of the United .States have I ecu
suffering enormous losses as a result of the
stupid and ruinous policy which the rresulcut
is endeavoring to check. Vast industries l are
been paralyzed, thousands of men have beeu
made idle, and pecuniary losses amounting to
many millions of dollars have been Incurred
because of scarcity of water In places and In
circumstances which indicate beyond reason
able doubt that the scarcity has been directly
caused by the reckless destruction of the stor
age reservoirs for water which nature pro
vided in the mountain forests. The bitter dis
tress which New England and Pennsylvania
have been suffering Is a scathing indictment
of tbe folly which has hitherto prevailed in th«
mountain regions of those states and of the
perversity with which certain influences in the
national * House of Representatives have re
sisted the enactment of laws that the admin
istration and the Senate have unanimously and
repeatedly approved and for which there ha«
been a popular demand seldom equalled In
unanimity and earnestness.
The object lesson thus presented in our own
land and time ought to be convincing and must
be to all whose minds are nor obstinately barred
against reason. Tremendously significant, also.
are the lessons of other lands, to some of
which the President forcibly refers. The plight
of v.-irlous provinces of Northern China is noto
rious, and no informed and reflective man will
dispute the fact that it. has been chiefly and
directly induced by shortsighted deforestation.
The same may be said of the vast region* of
Central and Western Asia, which once were th«
seat of the world's most populous and most
prosperous empires, but which fire now largely
desert wastes with a spars* and Impoverished
population. It is. indeed, not impossible nor
Improbable that the same processes occurred
in Northern Africa and that what is now the
world's greatest desert was once a fertile aiv)
populous region tributary to the mighty cities
which fronted upon the Southern Mediterra
nean.
It il obvious that vegetable life in forests
nnd elsewhere is an essential part of the econ
omy of nature through which th« surface of the
globe has been made and is kept In a condition
suitable for man's habitation. The result of
Interference with this, as with any other of
nature's laws, is "bound to be disastrous. It
would be fatuous to Imagine Hint in that re-
Bpect any more than in any other this country
is -xempt from th« operation of universal low.
The game results which have followed from the
same causes in other lands will inevitably be
fall this country. The part of wisdom is nol
to fancy that we alone of all persons are privi
leged to defy'tn'e laws of nature with impunity,
but to profit from the examples of other lands,
to avoid their disastrous follies and to ace
ourselves In accord with the laws which to
their own ruin they attempted to defy.
BRIDGE INVESTIGATION.
The request of the City Club to the. Mayor for
the appointment of "one or more competent
"bridge engineers to inspect the plan- and
"stress sheets of the Manhattan Bridge" Is
one that can scarcely be denied. The Bridge
Department is so utterly discredited by the rev
elations of its blundering and ignorance with
n een >nce to the Queensboro Bridge that doubts
respecting Its other activities, expressed by such
a body bp the City Club, cannot be cleared up
by any blanket assurances from the Bridge
Commissioner or bis chief engineer that all is
well, or by any flippant Jokes from the Mayor.
Certainly the Mayor cannot want to see. the
history of the Queensboro Bridge repeated in
the new structure, and must wish to have any
defects which may exist remedied while there
is yet time.
The bridge may be all right, but the Brldce
Department, which d'd not know that the
Queen Bridge was being overloaded, can
not be trusted as the sole guarantor that it l<
all right. Indeed, It may be doubted If the
Bridge Department knows any more about the
Manhattan Bridge than It is proved to have
known about the Queensboro Bridge, for it is
reported among engineers that the depart
ment's stress sheets, which the City Club says
should be examined by experts, do not exist In
any complete form, but, in fact, are now in
course of preparation, having been only begun
when the department, under the stimulus of
the Queensboro Bridge revelations, felt Im
pelled to try to find out what It was doing vrith
the Manhattan Bridge, If it Is true that the
department builds bridges first and determines
their strength afterward, it Is high time that
a much more thorough investigation even than
the City Club a c ks should be made.
The City Club in Its letter to the Mayor rust
gests' that there is an Important question with
reference to the Queensboro Bridge yet unset
tied — namely, responsibility for the confessed
defects and loss to the taxpayers. President sfc-
Aneny of the City Club says that he under
stands some of the money under the contract
li.-is not been paid, and be thinks the question
of proper payments and liability should be
carefully taken up. We ajjree that 11 should be.
The taxpayers should certainly be informed
if their interests have beeu protected or if my
city officials have betrayed them by maUng
Improper payments In baste in anticipation o - :
the adverse report of Messrs. Boiler i"v- Flodge
That is « subject on which light might profit
ably be thrown.
MR. TAFT .1Y, r > THE ZOITTI

And. hs Mr. Taft said, the. South has ev«*ry-

and participating more fully In the life «'f the
nation. It is cntitlod to a larger share in the
government, and 11 will serve its own interests
by taking its rightful place in the councils >>f
the coontry. Public questions of wider Import
deserve consideration upon their merits In the
South, and thai Is Impossible bo long as every
real and living question affecting the nation is
tbere subordinated to the '"negro question." la
laying stress upon this, to the exclusion of nil
other topics, the South debars itself from tak
lug an Intelligent position on questions that
vitally affect the "New South." the modern in

old patriarchal South.

the south, a more generous appreciation of it
and a broader sympathy with it. As a repre

enter the White House the Souths sincere and
most powerful friend.
Tin: INSURANCE iWB.
Governor Hugbes's belief that the Insurance
laws have not yet been sufficiently tested to
call for the appointment of such a commission
as that urged by the Chamber of Commerce to
recommend amendments is easily understood
when the fact is (a ken Into consideration thai
bo bag not yet been able t«> put the adminis
tration of those laws into the hands of an In
surance Commissioner of his own choice and
satisfactory to himself. Ho doubtless feels that
ttie laws need it longer and more favorable test.
But it is obvious that the Governor is open
minded ns to the merits of the legislation In
detail, He writes that he would not bare been
opposed to an amendment offered last winter if
it had been framed In the right spirit and had
been moderate and "conservative." He Bays,
moreover, that he is ready to give careful con
sideration to any amendment which may bo laid
before him. if. therefore, the Chamber of Com
merce had any specific changes in mind which
it regarded as desirable In the public interest
when it passed the resolution addressed to the
Governor, why should it not appoint a commit
tee to consider the operations of the Insurance,
laws and to draft such amendments as ex
perience, to the committee's mind, shows to be
necessary? Amendments thus suggested would
come with more authority nnd would doubtless
be more fairly and broadly conceived than those
prepare,! last winter by the Insurance com
panies themselves, which the (Governor felt
that he bad to veto.

THE TALK OF THE DAY.
According to the Berlin papers of that day LIU
Lehmann expressed the wish that her sixtieth
birthday. hich occurred on November 26. should
not be noticed by the musical profession, us she
desired to c-lebrat- th- day in the circle of h»r
most intimate friends. Her many admirers, how
ever, sent flowers, telegrams and congratulatory
messages of all kind*, in great numbers. Among
tlie messages were many from America, where
she scored many triumph?. Despite her Injunc
tion, the members of a prominent conservatory in
Berlin serenaded the singer, and she consented to
receive from them a great laurel wreath.
