NETS SAVE MANY
Boston, Mass.—Twenlv-five men
were killed in a lire thai swept
through the upper floors of tlu Ar
cadia liotel, a lodging house in the
Southland this morning. A number
of others are missing and scores
were injured by jumping from the
windows. .Nearly all the hodies were
lutrned and mutilated, making iden
tification impossible.
All the victims were men in poor
circumstances who resorted to the
place for a night's lodging. Caught,
in crowded bunks 011 the fifth tloor,
the lodgers were helpless and died
like rats in a. trap. The stairways
"were all atlamc when the alarm was
Riven.
According to the clerk there were
ITS men registered. Xot nearly this
number has been accounted for.
The firemen spread their nets and
many were saved in this way, but
the intense heat, of flames drove the
firemen back and made it necessary
to light, the tire from the street. Af
ter the firemen moved back, the men
continued to jump troni the upper
windows. The fire escapes were
blocked by the flames.

Dead wood, S. 15.—Fist fights and
charges of rump conventions charact

and minority proposals committee
meetings in the democratic and re
publican party gathering^ respect

participated in the five factional gath

house.
The minority or anti-Byrne repub
licans chose Mayor Harry-Howard of
Lead, as state proposal committee
man, and the majority or Byrne men
chose Neal Hall, of I.ead, present
county treasurer and another faction
which the first two charge was a
rump" affair elected George Fallon
of I.ead as state committeeman. No
fight developed on the county ticket.
The democrats strove for control
of the majority or Johnson wing of
the party, each holding a separate
convention which the other charged
was spurious and one set named Ed
ward McDonald as state majority
committeeman and the other Matt
Plunkett as slate majority committee
man. The minority democrats failed
to appear. The two democratic fac
tions got into an arugment over con
trol of the joint meeting and blows
were struck. Sheriff Nooman finally

and support to the republican party
and especially to the progressive mea
sures enacted in the state and the

"Naturally, we favor a policy of
progressive legislation upon which
all republicans can unite with the
end in view that human rights shall
take precedence over property rights
and in which the rights of the ordin
ary citizen will be zealously guarded
as against spepial privileges and the
interests of powerful financial organ
izations.
"We recommend and endorse the
record of the several progressive re
publican members of the South Da
kota delegation in Washington, D. C.
and especially the progressive states
manship of Senator Coe I. Crawford
and Senator Thomas Sterling.
"We heartily endorse the able and
progressive administration of Prank

support. The expenditures of a state
