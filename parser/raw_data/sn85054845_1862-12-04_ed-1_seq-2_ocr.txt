I'rccrrcMis at tUo War
Notwithstanding the reverses of our
army in Virginia under Pope and M'Clkl
Lan, the country has made substantial
progress in the conquest of the rebellion.
Our very reverses in the one section give
us for the future an experienced, disci
plined aud veteran arajy which equipped,
, with all the besfc appliances of modern
warfare, under wise leadership, cannot
fail to go conquering and to conquer.
- On this topic, the Chambersbure: Re
- . "
posUory & Transcript says: If checks
. and humiliations have occurred to our
; arms in the east, they have been more
thau counterbalanced by steady, sure
progress in the West and Southwest. At
no point, from the Ohio river to the Gulf
of Mexico, are the rebels to be found in
formidable force. Their recent threaten
ing advance toward the cities of Louisville
and, Cincinnati, notwithstanding the blun-
r tiering incompetency that opposed, has,
"V- resulted in a precipitate and demoralizing
- retreat. The defeat of Pbice and Van
Dorx at Corinth has opened tho way fori
General Grant to oenetratc further into
'J Mississippi than had yet been done by
. any Union lommander. The victories!
- ; of General Ccktis west of the Mississippi
1 river, have resulted in bringing Arkansas
" completely under Union sway, whilst to
, the north of his department, on the same
eide of the river, no enemy remain to
disturb but a few adventurous marauders.
& At New Orleans, Gen. Lutler is wisely
, and efficiently administering military law,
and daily strengthening in that section
. the Union cause, both by moral suasion
and the judiciou3 application of the force
at his command. The blockade is con
stantly becoming more complete, by reas
on of the capture of secession seaport
. cities. The entire coast of Texas is now
said to be under Union control, and the
government promises before long to take
possession of a number of important paints
that will make its guarding the remaining
coast a blockade in fact as well a in
name.
The work for the coming winter com
prises the .complete opening of the Miss
issippi river to commerce and navigation,
the only point of obstruction being Vicks
burg. This task has been confided to
Maj. Gen. M'Clerxand, although in con
nection with his movement there is to be
a combination of movements that should
result in more and even greater successes.
The navigation of the Mississippi restored,
the government by means of its gunboats
will be enabled completely to sever the
rebellion, thereby cutting oft the rebels
from the productive regions of Texas and
Arkansas, from which hitherto they have
drawn a great part of their supplies. The
Fall rains, too, will shortly enable the
Union gunboats, the terror of the rebsls,
to ascend the several streams, East and
"West, running through the most thickly
settled and productive parts of rebeldom.
In connection with these results and
promises of results, to estimate our real
progress in the war, we must not forget
the substitution as commander of the
army of the PoJomac, of the live, energet
ic, self reliant Burnside, in the place of
the doubting, hesitating, .never-ready,
although accomplished M'Clellan. The
change has infused vigor into the army,
as well as hope into the country, and
promises the best results. The new com
rrtaader has decided to operate against
Richmond from Fredericksburg, a point
long thought of and often suggested as a
hase by emineufc military men. But a
eingle week had elapsed from the time
TSURNSIDE took command until he had
the entire army in motion Sumner's
column now lies opposite Fredericksburg,
and other portions of the army within
easy supporting distance. We now hear
no more of mud, although the muddy
season of the year has come. We hear
no more of regiments or divisions being
ju want of quartermaster supplies, al
though where this happen to be the case,
the men arc font on and the supplies for
warded after' a practical, common sense
inuthp; Every token indicates a vigor
ous nd stirring Winter campaign in Vir
ginia, am? against the heart of the rebel
lion at llichmond. From Fredericksburg
to Richmond Gen Burnside has but sixty
miles. Many conflicts and much suffer
ing may lie in the way, but we confident
ly expect that the Grand Army of the
Potomac will celebrate the near Christmas
in the now proud and defiant capital of
the Old Dominion.
IliaeJiit nan's Cast.
Ex-President Buchanan, in a. letter
which wc print on to day's outside, closes
the controversy-between Gen. Scott and
himself. We give place to this letter, not
because of any intrinsic merit it possesses
in itself, but, on the contrary, to aSLOid
our readers au opportunity o see and
judge of the miserable quibbles and shifts,
which the writer attempts to take advan
tage of in his futile endeavor to prove
himself a patriot. 12 is play on word,
and dates, and expressions, atnoyut to jut
nothing at all it will not deiioostrite
his'innocence to a country whk-h-bas ar
raigned him at the bar of public opiuiou-.
His case requires something more than
mere sophistry and glittering generali
ties. In the language of a cotemporary :
"Docs James Buchanan suppose that
tha people of the United States have for
gotten that, at a moment when the South
ern traitors hd given notice of their
intention to bTeak up the Union, if they
could do so, by seceding from Congress,
he delibt.rately, in the Presidential man
sion, in the face of bia accountability to
God, and to his solemn oath, with his law
ministers at his side, enunciated the de
structive and infamous doctrine that while
a State had no right to leave the Union,
the Government had no power-to protect
itwdf from annihilation ? After this pro
clamation, which amounted, if not to an
invitation ,to treason, at leat to an indul
gent amnesty to all who might choose to
commit treason, what folly and what in
solence to set up the plea that he after
wards made any honest effort to avert the
catastrophe which he thus provoked V
After the crushing rejoinder of Gen.
Scott to his sophistries and lame apolo
gies, wc had fondly imagined that. Mr.
Buchanan would be content to bury
himself in the privacy acd gloom of hife
loved Wheatland forever. But, no! His
itching anxiety to escape the odium which
is pressing in on all sides to surround him
causes him to resort to tricks and strata
gems worthy of an Artful Dodger to
avert, if possible, the doom which awaits
him. He Bums up an array of the most
insignificant circumstances, and then com
placently says Behold the proofs of my
patriotism !
His every step in his own defence, how
ever, only develops and augments his
guilt, and ensures for himself the con
tempt and pity of honest men. James
Buchanan,-in his late attempts at public
letter-writing, has not only written him
self down a Traitor, but be Las also. writ
ten himself an ass. Let the reader peruse
his last effusion, and then endorse our
assertion as a matter of conviction and
necessity.
Congress.
The XXXVIIth Congress convened at
Washington city on Monday, 1st inst.,
for its second session, which will termin
ate with its legal existence on the 4th of
March a period of thirteen weeks. In
the Senate, Vice President Hamlin being
absent, the body was called"" to order by
the President pro tern, Senator Foote.
All the Senators were present except
Messrs. Bayard, Doolittue, Hale,
Kenedy, Pearce, Wilmot and Wilson,
(Mo.) In the House, the roll of mem
bers was called by States, and a quorum
answered to their names. After some
unimportant business, both Houses took a
recess of fifteen miuutes to await the re
ception of the President's Message.
The following is the telegraphic sum
mary of the Message :
"It favors African colonization. The opin
ion among th blacks regarding the project
it says is gradually improving.
"Our foreign relations remain undisturbed.
"The President kuows of no mode which
promises such certain results as the organ
ization of banking associations under a gen
eral act of Congress well guarded iu its pro
visions "The President encloses his emancipation
proclamation of September, and says there is
no line, straight or crooked, suitable for a
national boundary upon which to divide.
"He recommends the adoption of an amend
ment to the Constitution, proposing that every
state in which slavery exists shall abolish
the same therein before the l?t of January
1900 the owners to be compensated by the
United States. All slaves who shall have
enjoyed, actual freedom by the chances of
the war, at any time before the end of the
rebellion, shall be forever free j but all own
ers of such who have not been disloyal shall
be compensated for them. Congress may
appropriate money for the colonization of
free colored persons, with their own consent,
at any place or places without the United
States'"

People have sometimes wondered why
Democratic journals placed a rooster at the

Parson Ilrownlow fully explains the matter,

crows after the Democrats have attempted to
betray the Government and place it in the

JJsS"" fighting at Fredericksburg yet.
The enemy are bringing up their entire army,
evidently to contest the passage of the river
by liurnside to the uttermost, aud a bloody
battle must ensue before we obtain possession
of the city. The failure to open hostilities
on our part i3 attributed to the non-arrival
of a pontoon train which should have been on
j hand the day Burnside reached the river.
The railroad from Acquia Creek to Freder

Tlae Proposed Mediation.
The letter of the French Miuister of
State, M. Drouvn I)e L'llujs, proposing
to uuite with England and Rusaiu in au
offer of mediation to the United States,
has been made public. As is known, the
clfer has been rejected by the other Pow
ers, and, therefore, it possesses to ns no
more interest than that of a State docu
ment which might have assumed a mo
mentous importance in our history. The
Miuiitcr of State presents his pic-positions
very frankly. He tells us that the Em
peror is moved to mediate partly by a hu
mane and partly by a selfish motive. He
des not like the continued, war between
"two populations his heart is moved by
the greut imbedding of blood. Then he
regrets that a groat source ot French
industry and. wealth has been dried up by
the existence of the blockade. For these
reasons he proposes that there shall be au
armistice of six months between the Union
and the rebels, aud that, in the meantime,
the ood oficc-i of the maritime Power.
Russia, France and England: would be
tendered to smooth away the uifficulties
that now exist between the contending
parties. Tlmt he is encouraged to sug
gest, because at the time the offer was
uixde there was no prospect of auy move
ment on the psrt of the antagonistic
armies, and in their strategic relation?
they occupied the game po.-ition that
they did in the commencement of the war.
The French Minister also thought he saw
Mgns of a desire for pe?ce iu the North
and South, and he was desirous of en
couraging the sentiment.
We see nothing iu the words of the
French Minister to show any real sympa
thy with the American Republic. He
neglects the great object for which we
are contending. He only sees in the
American quarrel an effusion of blood,
which moves the eyes of his majesty to
tears, and a stoppage of tobacco and
cotton which embancsses his revenue.
He only asks for six months of a truce.
He does not jee that these mx months
can only be followed by a dishonorable
peace; that they can only cause anxiety
on the part of those who have thiis war to
fight; intrigue on the part of bad men
here, and in Europe, and the South ; vast
smuggling operations, in which the factors
of Lyons, aud Liverpool, and Charleston
would become enriched. It would be the
undoing of hU that we have done. It
would be to breathe life into the expiring
South. It would enable Mr. Laird to
complete a few more privateers, and Mr.
3Iason to replenish the arsenals of the
Southern Confederacy. The terms of our
volunteer enlistments would be very soon
ove.r, and befure another campaign could
bi fought we should have a, disorganized
army. The rebels would atk no better
support than that of a six months'" truce.
They could realire on their cotton,
strengthen their treasury, and by the aid
of their Northern friends weaken public
sentiment in the North, and endeavor to
prepare the way for a dishonorable peace.
We must fight this battle to the end.
We entered the contest with reluctance ;
we had no desire to quarrel but when
war became the alternative of degradation,
we accepted tho bloody gambit, and the
issue is with God. To that issue all that
we have is committed. Money, life, blood,
are as nothing in comparison with our
great design. The six months that Na
poleon proposes to devote to intrigue and
diplomacy and the preparation of pro
tocols we can employ in a better bus
iness. Vie are now moviug on to Rich
mond, and in a few weeks we shall ac
complish by the sword more than the
European powers could accomplish by any
mediation or intervention. A little while
longer and all will be well. We feel that
the end is at hand, and we can shape our
destiny even as we commenced it, w ithout
the fear or the favor ot any sovereign
that sits upon a throne. iVt-s,s. ,;
Jy A FoTt Delaware correspondent
furnishes the Pittsburg Dispatch with the
following little bit of history, as to how
Floyd was prevented from sending the
Pittsburg qtins to the South : A day or
two since 1 obtained some particulars iu
lelation to Floyd's attemped shipment of
heavy artillery from Pittsburg, which, in
the absence of iudivYfiual names, might,
nevertheless, be of some interest. These
pieces, ostensibly ordered for Ship Island,
near New Orleans, were really intended
for Fort Morgan at the eutrance of Mobile
Ray. The platforms were constructed at
Watervliet; but, as the Engineer foresaw
treason in the Secretary of War, they
were purposely made three inches too
short, with other defects which rendered
them useless for Fort Morgan, but quite
suitable for a new work at the opening of
New York harbor. Other platforms were
then ordered. The glacis or outside
work prepared for their receptiou at Fort
Morgan was pushed to completion.
Floyd had all things ready for the great
guns at Pittsburg, when events were pre
cipitated by the rash treason of the South
Caroliuians, and the rebels lost both guns
and platforms. . J
A diamond weighing 12 carats, and
worth between 810,000 and 813,000, is
now on exhibition in Boston. It is repor
ted to have been found in Stole county,
in the northern part of N. Carolina, near
Blue Ridge. In size it approaches a large
plum stone in length, but it is deeper and
broader, almost a square on the face, with
rounded corners. In the rough it was
about square. Each of the numerous
facets had to be ground down, separately,
it being unsafe to chip off corners for tpar
of cracking the stone. The cost of the
fine sand used for this purpose was over
$100, and tha work will cot 1,500.
What Has Pennsylvania Donc t
In looking over the operations of a year,
we sometimes become almost incredulous
of the things that are wat palpable, so
numerous have actually been the results
jid the achicvments.of Pennsylvania. If
one year ago, the people had. been told that
what has been done, would become a part
of their labor in discharging their duty
to the national government; it is very
likely that the very men who now regard
the action of Pennsylvania as only half u
test of the power ot the Commonwealth,
would then have pronouueed the task im
possible. For instance Pennsylvania has
piid $0,000,000 tax to the United States
government paid this sum in advance,
before she has gathered a single penny
from her people. What other state could
have or has done as much ' At the same
time that this enormous sum was advanced
to the government, the other expenses of
the state were fairly met. aud in thus
meeting this sum, the state government
has saved the people a handsome sum in
the reduction which was granted for the
advance payment.
Jn the furnishing of men to swell the
armies of the republic, the Keystone state
presents a record which no other loyal state
can equal. The quota of the three years'
men required both skill and tact to recruit.
While this portion of Pennsylvania's force
was being raised, other men were called to
serve a less time, yet in the face of this
disparagement ot terms, the entire quota
for three years was raised. Other states
have been called on to raise their quota of
this three years' force. This was not
responded to by the other states, and on
the loth of August last a draft was order
ed in such states to make up these deficien
cies. This draft has never been enforced
in tuch states, so that Pennsylvania, to
day, is the only state that has her three
years' regiments "up to within a figure that
may be regarded as their maxima strength.
Pennsylvania is also, the only state that
has almost doubled her three ears' men,
because the regiments for this period that
first sent to the field were more than half
destroyed. Let any other state nay, let
any nation in the world, show a like
force, alacrity, vigor and promptness.
Under the call of the 4th of August,
for 300,000 men, Pennsylvania prescuts a
similar alacrity and vigor. Her quota of
that force is complete. Her regiments
forming this quota are all fully organized
and either iu the field or ready to march
at adav's notice. Let it be remembered,
too, that the material comprising these
forces is of that order lrom which heroes
are made. Better men never marched at
the word of command or shouldered a mus-.
kct in defer.ee of a holy cause.
All this is what Pennsylvania, has done
towards the support of the federal gov
ernment. While she was engaged in this
work, it must be rcmetubered that the
state was hourly and daily discharging for
the federal uovernmeut. In less than five
days, when the Commonwealth was sud
denly threatened with invasion, fifty thou
sands men were put iu motion, more than
one-half of that number fully armed and
equipped, and thrown on the border ready
to meet any foe that might show himself
for fight. The late Commander-in-Chief
of the Army of the Potomac acknowledged
that service by admitting that the display
of this force was instrumental in intimi
dating the army under the rebel Lee, if
not in aetunlly frustrating the designs of
that able general to invade the north.
What has Pennsylvania done ? How
magnificently, as well as eloqueutly, does
the record answer this question ?
$cT,The intelligence that our armies in
the West will all shortly move in concert
will be hailed with pleasure by every one
who has the success cf the loyal cause at
heart. Those tried veterans, the heroes
of Henry, Donelson, I'ca Ridge, Corinth,
and other bloody fields, will soon be on
the march to deal far heavier blows than
they have ever done beforehand establish
the supremacy of the Union and the Con
stitution over the fertile valleys of the
Mississippi. The only obstacle in the way
of opening the "Father of Waters" to its
mouth are the fortified towns of Vicksburg
an I Port Hudson. All that nature and the
devices of accomplished engineer officers
could do, has been done to make these
places impregnable to any force that we
can bring against them. To confront
thesft strongholds of the rebellion, and to
reduce them to submission to the Consti
tution and the laws, we have two armies,
commanded by brave aud accomplished
ofhcers.and composed ot men who have al
ready been participants in the deadly strife
and who aro only pining for the word of
command that wili bring them face to face
with the rebels. In addition to these, we
have a gallant little fleet, whose former
achievements are asuro guarantee that iu
the future they will do as well as they
have done in the past. The expedition
of'General McClerand is now at Columbus,
but the Government has obtained a larjje
number of steamers, and the soldiers will
shortly embark on them. Admiral Porter,
with wonderful tact and industry, has re
fitted the navy made famous by former
success, nd has sent several gunboats
down the river to reconnoitre the position
of the rebels. The army of Gen. Grant,
which will undoubtedly eo-operate with
that of General MeClernanu, is still at
Lagrange, but will also shortly miich
forward. It is possible that this army,
before it reaches its point of destination,
Jackson, will have to fight a battle or two,
but we are confident that it will be ulti
mately successful. With two such armies,
may we not confidently hope that the
great Mississippi river will again be free
by Chrictmai ?
A Wall from I lie Rebels.
The following article from the Charles,
ton Cuii) if rt a t aper which was tnuch lesj
anxious to enter upon the sea of warthaa
its cotemporary, the Mercury, Tthen the
long-sowu seeds of the Rebellion first be
gan to sprout in that hot-bed of treason,
shows the depth of the misery brought
upon the Southern States:
The continuance of this contest involves
increased suffering. The evils that follow
iu the train of this calamitous visitation
grow more direful with every day. Other
hearts than those now aching with aai-cty
and bleeding from bcrearament nre rent
with grief, and the friend who sympathized
with some afHieted one yesterday, to-daj
wcepl bitter tears over his own sorrow.
Tho iron is driven tho deeper, and our
burdens become more and more heavy.
And thutfgh more than eighteen months
have passed away since the strife was be
gun, the end scctn3 more distant than it
appeared to be a twelve months sincet
liope after hope has gone out in darkness,'
and expectations we had fondly cherished
have turned out to be miserable delusions;
So often have we -been disappointed aDd
deceived, that now our faith rajects every
promise and turns away from every shrn;
Our foe is as active and determined and
powerful a3 ever he was, and the. agent
that was to compel foreign nations to in
tervene aud put an end to this wicked and
infamous contest, has not been potent
enough to accomplish that end.
We stand alone. Vast hosts are mus
tering to repeat in stronger force and with
more obstinate courage the attempts that
have been made, and strongholds hitherto
unattacked will soon have to bear the most
furious onslaughts the enemy, with his
wonderful resources of ingenuity and ma
terial, is capable of making. To frustrate
his well-conceive 1 plans, to repel these
terrible attacks, wc have to depend entire
ly upon ourselves. The foe will do his
utmost ; military genius and knowledge,
the boundless credit of the Government,
the best mechanical skill mind, money,
muscle have all combined to insure suc
cess. And while these tremendous efforts are
being put forth while our homes aro
darkened by the shadow of the death
angel's wing and our bosoms wrung with
anguish while we are enduring grevious
privations and hardships, and our soldiers
are almost naked, we stand alone.
It is true foreign tongues mention onr
name with respect and admiration. . It is -true
our fortitude and gallantry have re- I
cieved abuudant reward in the glowiDg
word of praise and in warm heartfelt
wishes for success. But sympathy and
admiration have afforded no substantial
assistance, and all unaided we brace our
nerves for the dreadful conflict.
tt5U At the opening of the U. S. Sen
ate, on Monday, noon, the following prayer
was made by Rev. Dr. Sunderland :
"Almighty find everla:ting God who
art in Heaven, while we, the creatures
upon earth, come to thee in our prayers to
be directed, are this day before thee. Wo
thank thee that thy servants are met
again in .the Capitol undisturbed. We
thank thee that thou hast graciously
preserved them during the period of their
separation, and hast brought then togeth
er in high conclave of the nation to
deliberate upon the affairs of a people
greatly afdicted but as yet not wholly
destroyed, and while we remember with
the deepest reverence and humiliation
that it has not pleased Thee to fully an
swer their former supplications from this
place, we yet implore Thy blessing upon,
this Congress no" convened together in
their coming counsels and labor. May
they stand in more than Jewish reverance
and in more than Roman virtue before
the people. Remove far away from this
body and the members of the American
Senate all levity of mind and of manners,
all profanity and volubility of speech,
and all unworthy motives and desires, to
give to them all wisdom, and gravity, and
propiety and influence with the people."
tQ- The drafted men in Camp Curtin
are marching for the seat of war, as fast a

In relation to the drafted men here, we
must state in this connection, that the de
sertions have been very large, indeed to
such an extent, "that some of the companies
are reduced one-third and even one-half.
Effjrts should be made to compel the re
