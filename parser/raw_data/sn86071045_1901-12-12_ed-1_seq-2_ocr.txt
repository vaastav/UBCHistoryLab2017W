WASHINGTON NOTES.
The new Hay-Paunceforte treaty
was reported favorably to the Senate.
Friday;also, the nomination of P. C.
Knox of Pittsburg as Attorney General.
In the Honse, Friday, a nnmber of
pension bills were introduced and
among them bills to pension David
Cnpps and G. Keifer of Bntler at S3O a
month each, and John Glenn of Mercei,
who is totally blind, at SSO per month,
by Rep. Showaiter; who also introduc
ed a bill for a pnblic building in Butler,
while Senator Penrose introduced a
similar bill in the Senate.
Rep. Dalzell introduced a bill to pen
sion the widow of Gen. Negley at
000 a year, and Rep. Taylor of Ohio,
one to pension the widow of President
McKinley at $.5,000 a year.
In the Senate, Monday, the Senators
from South Carolina again played their
one act farce Senator Lodge of Mas
sachusetts finally shut them off by mov
ing to go into executive session "while
the resignations of which the Senators
are talking are being made."
Speaker Henderson seems to have
dealt as fairly by Pennsylvania in the
matter of committee appointments as
was possible, considering t'ne State's
* large membership in the House. The
fact that sections have to be represent
ed upon the important committees has
to be taken into confederation, and this
often gives a State with but half a
dofcen members as good a showing, if
not better, than either Pennsylvania or
New York, with delegations number
ing 30 and 32 respectively, can be given.
Pennsylvania gets but four chairman
ships —Mr. Grow, on Education; Mr.
Mahon, on War Claims; Mr. Olmsted,
on Elections No. 2, and Mr. Wanger, on
Expenditures in the Postoffice Depart
ment.
Mr Sbowalter was given places on the
Railways and Canals, Public Buildings
and Labor committees.

liards, SB.
POLITICAL.
"The Pittsburg developments will do
public good. Those >who championed
the ripper can see now that such revo
lutionary legislation is dangerous. The
advocates of reform must fight for it
before the people and win at the polls, ,
not expect to get it from professional
politicians by a coup de grace."—Rep.
Acheson.
On Friday last Major A. M. Brown
made a public statement of his political
connections with Gov. Wm. A. Stone
from the time his name was first sug
gested for City Recorder until his re
moval from that office by the Governor.
The statement includes a history of all
conferences held and the correspondence
with the Governor on the question of
removing City Solicitor Clarence Bur
leigh, Director J. O. Brown, Director
John M. Anderson, Delinquent Tax Col
lector Robert Ostermaier and others
and the appointment of others in their
places. Major Brown's conclusion from
all the facts in his possession is that
Governor Stone and the Flinn-Brown-
Burleigh combination had entered into
an agreement that he should be remov
ed from the Recordership.
A dispatch from Washington, dated
Sunday, snifl that Senator Quay loft
this morning for his winter home at St.
Lucie, FJa. where his friends say he will
remain until he has completely recover
ed from the congh wnich has eriven him
so much trouble for the past two months.
He was accompanied by Mrs. Quay, Miss
Cora Quay. Capt. A. G. C. Quay and
Attorney General John P. Elkin.
It was not generally known until this
morning that Mr. Elkin was to be of the
Senator's party, and their going togeth
er causes some comment among Penn
sylvanians in Washington. Of course,
it is believed that the Gubernatorial
nomination next year,and the availabil
ity of Mr. Elkin as a candidate, will be
fully discussed during the latter's stay
in Florida.
It is now positively asserted by peo
ple and papers antagonistic to Senator
M. S. Quay that he was directly respons
ible for and a party to the last reyolu
tion in the city government of Pitts
burg. The Philadelphia North Ameri
can claims to have positive information
that at the celebrated conference at
Beaver before the fall election among
Senatot Quay, J. O. Brown, Clarence
Burleigh and Roger O'Mara the Sen
ator assured J. O. Brown that.Le would
be made City Recorder of Pittsburg
after the election in the event of the
"Organization'' giving a good majority
for Potter and Harris in Allegheny
county. This is now declared to be the
reward offered for the fight made for
the State ticket here.
It has so frequently been asserted
that Senator Quay was angry at the
action of Governor Stone in removing
Maj. A. M. Brown from the Recorder
ship that most people believed this
statement true. It is now pointed out
that Senator Quay's alleged indigna
tion on the subject has not found ex
pression in any statement from him to
which Governor Stone cotild object.
In fact, those who have in past j ears
learned to consider Senator Quay as a
trickster now believe that the whole
Pittsburg embroglio, beginning with .the
promise of the rippeT's passage, has
been in the "Old Man's" hands and that
Governor Stone has simply made his
moves on the political chess board under
the direction of the past master in the
game. "—Dispatch.

OIL NOTES.
THE MARKET— Both agencies are
paying $1 30. this morning.
"The reduction in the production ol
Pennsylvania oil as shown by the runs
for the month of November is a source
of gratification to many producers, as
the situation will soon compel the
Standard Trust to very materially ad
vance prices, which should have been
done long ago.
The decline in the production for tlie
month of November, compared with tin
month of October amounts to about
SUOO barrels daily.
The production for the month ol
November this year is about 14,500
barrels daily less than for the month ot
November oue year ago.
During the past twelve months, the
net stocks have decliued a little over
3,100,000 barrels.
During the past five monihs alone,

past month being about 600,000 barrels;
the net stocks at the end of last month
are just about 10.000,000 barrels, not
one half of which could be delivered it

Destiny.
A tiny rill peeped forth from a hill,
And leaped to catch the light,
But a little stone stopped the current
thrown
And turned it left and right.
And that on the left plunged down a
steep
In a torrent to seek the sea;
While that on the right swept valleys
broad
In a river's majesty
And each would fain turn back again
To the mountain rill of its birth;
But never and never have streams flow
ed back
Since God first formed the earth.
Thus our lives flow on while we wonder
and look,
As flow the torrent and river.
But to turn them back to the babbling
brook
That can be done, ah, never!
And when we have sunk in ocean's
grave
And risen again from the deep,
In some cloud afloat we then may note
How a pebble small on souie far-off
hill
Changed our current and course for
ever. E. H. N.
