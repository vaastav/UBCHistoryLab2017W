the knowledge, that so many forms of
sickness are not due to any actual dis

everywhere esteemed so highly by all
who value good health. Its beneficial
effects are due to the fact, that it is the

Washixotoji, Dee. 7. Secretary of
theXavy Herbert.iu his anuual report,
asks congress at the coming session to
authorize
Turee I.i tht-Dn.fl lUtlleshlptand Twelve
Torpedo Itoals.
He recommends that these ships be
planned for an extreme deep-load
draft of not more than 23 feet, and sug
gests that considerations of strategy
upon our Atlantic and gulf coasts ren
der this an essential to the success of
naval campaigns.
"This reasoning," he says, 'Is the
final result of much careful study by
able officers of conditions as they ex
ist on our southern coast Ilattleships
that could enter the harbors of Savan
nah, llruuswick, Key West, Tampa,
l'eusacola. Mobile and the month of
the Mississippi at all tiim s would have
an immense advantage over the battle
ships of foreign nations, few of which
could enter these ports. Light draft
battleships, if we had theu), could
matte any of these ports bases of
supply, could sally forth from them or
retire into them at will and could
therefore almost always offer battle on
their own terms.
"There are also many of om ports
further north, which would give the
same advantages to such ships."
An interesting feature of the report

The I'nhnllillnE of the w Na
From the time of its inauguration un
der Secretary Chandler. Congress has
authorized during the present admin
istration 20 vessels, with a total ton
nage of fu.&jfl tons; of these live are
first-class battleships and 16 torpedo
boats,
"Large as the above increase ap
pears," says the secretary, "it yet
does not suffice to place the United
Stales navy in a satisfactory condi
tion, if we mean to be able at all times
to defend our long line of seacoast,

maintain under all circumstances our

The 'secretary, calling attention to
tlie

states that while the results ach ieved
by the United Mutes are highly cred
itable to the country, yet it is clenr
that the great powers with which we
are brought into close relationship
largely exceed us, not only in too
number of battleships and torpedo
boats actually in commission, but in
their naval programmes for the fu
ture. The secretary shows that on June
30, UM, there were SO vessels in com
mission, with a tonnnge of 62.S20 tons,
while on December )0 the total ton

asks congress to authorize the build

size to take in tho largest vessel of the

. Wilson, of Ohio, stopped on his
way to Washington, to pay his re
spects. "T here will be su extra ses

n favor of it unless we are sure what
the senate will do. It would be
rather humiliating for the republi
cans to have an extra session snd then
fail to accomplish snv thing by reason
of opposition in tho senate."
Mai. Mckinley read DresidenU leve-
land's massage through about noon
yesterdav with great interest, but
without comment The portion oi it
devoted to the Cuban question was
discussed by those present The con
census of opinion was that it was an
informing presentation of the situa
tion, ami, on the whole, about w hat
was expected.
Col. M. T. Derrick, of Cleveland,
said it was conservative, and breathed
s 6pirit of fairness which would be
commended.
The opening sentence, with its
strong implied approval of the results
of the recent election, seemed full of
pleasant interest for the president
elect, though he made no verbal com
ment upon any portion of the docu
ment lie read aloud parts of it to a
group of friends, sud they enmmeuted
occasionally on 6ome of the president's

Maj. McKinley turned to the por
tion of the message devoted .to a con
sideration of Cuban affairs with the
Keenest interest, and read it aloud
in clear, earnest toues. A congress
man who was near by safd:
"1 resident Cleveland s exposition of
the Cuban problem, and his statement
of existing conditions is just, graphic
and conservative, but it is perhaps less
sympathetic with the insurgents than
most people hoped for. 1 do not think
his idea about home rule for Cuba w ill
come to anything practical, for the
Cubans will not trust the Spanish gov
ernment and would put no faith In
their first promise. It looks to me as
though we would have to recognize
the insurgents as belligerents within
ninety days."

tors of the Ieed.
Littlk Rock, Ark., Dee. 8 A spe
cial from Malvern, Ark., says: What
may be regarded as reliable informa
tion bus just reached here that on last
Tuesday afternoon, at a point about
midway between Camden and Hear
ten, on the line of the Cotton belt
railroad, occurred one of tho foulest
massacres of negroes that has ever
blackened the record of that locality.
At the placo mentioned a section
gang, composed principally of negroes,
with a white foreman, were engaged
iu their labor of improving the road
bed, when a gaugof unknow n persons
made their appearance upon the scene
and without warning began immedi
ately to fire into the crowd of help-
ess and unsuspecting negro laborers,
which resulted in the death of five of
them. The foreman claims that he
did not recognize any of the assassins,
but many believe that lie knows who
they are, but, on account of probabil
ity of personal danger to himself, he
is afraid to give out any information
that would lead to their arrest.
The section where these lust mur
ders occurred is occupied almost en
tirely by the sawmill interests, and is
tilled with lawless characters. It was
In that same locality that dipt. Tom
Justice, a former citizen of this coun
ty, aud a veteran sawmill man, lost
his life at the hands of assassins two
years ago. It w as here also that many
other murders have occurred within
the last five years, and ns yet justice
has been meted out to none of the
murderers.
It is understood that the sheriff of
Ouachita county is exerting himself in
every way possible to apprehend the
guilty ones. In addition to the effcrts
of the sheriff, the Cotton Delt railroad
company has offered a reward of 8250
for the capture of the murderers. If
they are captured it is believed the
courts of Ouachita county will mete
out swift justico to them.

New York, Dee. 8. The Journal has
the following special by cable from
Havana:
The rebels havo ridden to the very
gates of Havana. Three days ago their
musket shots could be heard in the
govemor-geueral's palace, and tho fires
kindled by them in the suburbs made
the sky light "
It was a w ild night in Havana when
the news came in. This city is seeth
ing with anx'ety. The Spaniards are
feverishly waiting for Cleveland's
message, the insurgents are gathering
all about Gomez is coming from the
east with an army. He is already
in Matauzas province, and has given
the government troops a battle.
The government admits a loss of over
200 killed and wounded, though it
claims the usual victory.
Quiutin Handera, with 7,00() Cubans,
is encamped tit Managua, six miles
from Guaunbaeoa.
Sunday morning nt daybreak 500 in
surgents rode through the streets of
liiiauabncoa. This town is connected
with Havana by telegraph and tele
phone, and there are half a dozen forts
within five minutes' walk, but tho in
vaders were not molested.
All of these things havo filled Ha
vana with wild excitement. When to
this is added the fact that no tidings
came from Capt. -Gen. Weylcr, the state
of tho capital may bo imagined. From
every sido word comes Unit tho woods
arofullof insurgents, and people do
not know which way to turn.
There may bo truth lu tho story
whispered about the cafes to-day that
Moceo has flanked W'eyler, and is now
between him and Havana. If Presi
dent Cleveland's message should be
adverso to Spain a riot is almost cer
tain, and tho mob will direct
itself against the Americans in
this city. Tho volunteers, who
practically constitute the garrison
of Havana, wiil lead the mob
instead of hindering It. It was the
volunteers who, in the last war, de
ported tho captain-genoral, seized the
city and murdered at will.
Such Is the general situation in
Havana.. Business is paralyzed, and

main commercial artery of Havana,

CuiCAOO, Dec 8. The editors of Chi
cago morning papers will comment on
the president's message as follows;
Times-Herald (independent):
Only the most urgent friends of Cubs can
complain of the tone of that part of tbs presi
dent s mes-s-c devoted to the relstlous of toe
United States with Spain. It lacks neither
boldness nor clearness, but It Is appreciative
of the duly of this government to preserve lu
plednesand aiaiuuinthe peace and prosper,
liy of Its people. No one v. Ill dissent fromiho
president's views with reference to the need
of remedying certain admitted defects In our
monoiarv svstem. Those who are famllur with
the obstinate and Indexible character of the
president's temperament did not expect that
his message would disclose any evidences of s
change of sentiment ou too revenue Question.
Record (independent):
That part of the president's message whlott
treats of the Cuban rebellion outlines a policy
which the subsequent administration may
have to recoeuize and adopt as providing the
only Just snd Ulgnifled way out of the diffi
culty. The passage Is logical lu thought sud
singularly clear In style. His threat to Spain
for the conditions ou which It Is based do not
make It any the less a threat will prtsent to
the European powers a very clear view of this
nation's attitude. The whole passage outlines
a polls' In which a fine deference to diplo
matic expediency Is not allowed to bar the way
for detinue aud vigorous action when It shall
be necessary.
Inter-Ocean (republican):
It U far from being a sensational document
There Is a deal of Indefinable discussion about
Cuba, lirovor Cleveland Illustrates the law
of heredity by a stroug penchant for preuch
Ing. only his homilies ore based ou current
events for texts. The most remarkable fea
ture of the message Is the defense of the Wilson-Gorman
bill. All this means, practically,
this congress need not pass the Dlngley bill,
for the president does uot propose to be a
party to any chanse In the revenue legislation
of the country. The president is Joined to free

tton. Tho Tribune (republican)
Regarding the Cuban question the mossuge
Is In the nature of a timosorvor and make
shift. It tries to throw off all responsibility
from the shoulders of the present uiiuiinlstru
liun and load it upon the back of the Incoming
administration. Tho president has nut the
nerve to do Us duty, uud ho leaves It fur his
succossur to perforin.
1 The Tribune indorses the president's
deliverance ou retiring the green
backs, uud on "revenue aud tariff"
says:
The tariff act of 18S4, which Prosldent Cleve
land rofused to sign because of its "incon
sistencies and crudities," seems to suit lilm
perfectly now. He thinks it has bonofitted the
people and ho is not disturbed by Us short
comings. Expressions by Senators anil ltepresenlu
lives. Washington, Dec. 8. Neither sen
ate nor house had u good opportunity
of judging of the president's message
by the public reading of it. Members
and senators were very chary in their
comments afterwards. A few ex
pressed themselves as follows:
Congressman Urosvenor (rep., O.):
Tho treatment of the Cuban and other for
eign manors will not bo satisfactory to thuso
who have oarueslly hoped for the early uctiun
of our country In the Interest of an early ces
sation of the wholesale murder In tho unhappy
Island of Cuba. The discussion of the Cuban
question is rather an apjlogy fur dulay
und non-actlou than the taking of a
stand and decisive position. Tho reference to
tho tariff If fur from satisfactory, uud that
portion of the message which treats of the
spoils system would bo better understood aud
more fully appreciated if the president had
franlily stilted that he and his department n'.ll-
cers had within tho post fuur years swept out
30,000 faithful uud cnlclcnt einpiuyos of the gov
ernment for no reason save that they were re
publicans, uud had tilled their places with
inexperienced und non-competont applicants,
all democrats, and all of whom were unlit tor
the places they got, u.nd all of whom woro re
warded for partisanship either to themselves
or their friends; and thou that the shield of
the civil service law has been used to Doroutu-
utc their tenure.
Fruucis G. Kewlautis (sil., Nov.) said
that no substantial relief, ho thought,
could be secured by multiplying prom
ises to pay gold lu the shape of bank
notes. The only thing to do was to
recoguizo tho fact that there wus not
enough gold to do the world's business
aud to restore bimetallism.
Speaker llocd said:
"It soems hardly uoccssury to comment unon
the messugo. It is calm In tune, und on the
Cuban question will bo much more satisfactory
io iub community man it would have uceu a
your ago. 1 wish there had boon as frank nn
acknowledgment of tho dollclt a year ago as
there Is now. Tne Idea that tho revenue Is
sufficient, being made so by borrowing, seems
to uo nardiy tenable.
Mr. MoMilliu (dem., Tcnn.) thinks
wo can safely urge home rule or local
self-government for Cuba. He is will
ing to go even further. Ha does not
approve the president's recommenda
tion for the retirement of greenbacks
by an issue of bonds.
Mr. Cannon (rep., 111.) said:
Everything demonstrates the absolute ne
cessity for revcuuo legislation that will brlnj
luereased receipts.
Upon the Cuban question he thoutrht
from his hasty reading of tho message
that congress should await oxeotitivo
action and recommendations as tn
Cu ba.
Oen. "Jou" Wheeler (dem.. Ala)
said he believed a decided, firm staud
with regurd to Cuba would receive tliu
approval of the civilized world.
Mr. McC'rcary (dem.) said:
I am pleasct with the president's reference
to the Cuban and Venezuelan questions und
the tariff. While I sympathise with the Cu
ban patriots, and hope some day to see Cuba
a free and Independent republic I do not ex
pect the president, so near the close of his
term, to recommend any legislation which
might seriously Interrupt tho friendly rela
tions exist! nt bctweon us and Spain, or which
might lead to war.
Mr. Taf t (rep., O. ) said:
The president has stated tha noslUnn r is.
United States forcibly. He shows that we
save responded to all the duties demanded by
International law. What he says may be con
aldered as a notice to Spain that the prosent
condition cannot continue indefinitely, The
president leaves It an open question whether
or not hs will Interfere. It looks as if he in-
venuen w turn tue Cuban question over to Mr
McKinley for seitlemoat.
Mr Loud (rep , Cal.):
The position of the preldenton Cuban af
fairs should receive the oommendatloo of all
Americans.
Mr. Patterson (dem., Tcnn.):
The president's treatment of the Cuban
question Is patriotic and statesmanlike. I be
lieve he has pointed out the way for sn honor
able settlement of a vexed problem.
Mr. Barrett (rep., Mass.):
The mewisgs shows that the administration
will do nothing regarding Cabs. That, and
the Hawaiian question, will go over to the
.uMJiHutraiiun. 'xue message shows a
Olesr purpose to veto averv rannhlliton
tlon bllL Therefore none will be passed, and
the new congress will be called together Id
wbiu w bo upon lais matter.
Mr. Dal sell (real. Pcnnavl
The message Is fair as to everything but the
tariff. The only two questions that tho public
sre Interested la are Cuba snd the tariff 1
like best that reference to Cuba where he
shows a determination not to permit any other
power to Interfere la the Island s affairs I
. ....... congress win join in the prest
dentsfesr that we wlU have too much rev.
enne and become extravagant,

Extraordinary War Measures Resorted
To Recently.
The well-informed and accurate Ma
drid correspondent or the wutiou o.m.
ard. to whom the world is much In
debted for news of Spanish govern
mental doings, gives a most interesting
- ,i th .train to which the gov-
eminent is subjected ou behalf of the
Cuban campaign. The war min.
(ien. Azcnrrugii. 1ms displayed great en
ergy iu providing troops, but he ha
i f.,r....,l to resort to some extraor-
.linnrv measures. At the outbreak of
the war he culled in some 15,001) men of
the llrst-clnss reserve, and men of the
classes of 1S94 and 1893, nud even some
of the class of ISM, who, after a few
months of training, had been dismissed
lo their homes In order to lessen army
expenses. Then he called for 85,001;
conscripts of 1S95 some months before
the usual time. These were boys of less
than 20 years of age, fine subjects for
an arduous foreign campaign in an un-
snnitarv country. No wonder many 0'
those drafted were found to have fled
from the country. No wonder, too, thai
no less than 18,100 of those who re
niaim-d chose to pay the government a
forfeit of $:m0 esch rather than be sent
to the Antillcan slaughter pen. lh.s
latter fact was, of course, a line thing
for the well-nigh bankrupt Spanish
treasury. It meant a wiiuiinii to it, oi
?.",4.!0,000, or enough to pay the costol
the war for ns much as two or three
weeks. Hut it meant n military force
of inferior quality, the vacancies being
filled with second-rate substitutes.
This year there will probably be n
similar harvest of forfeit money. The
minister has called for 1S90 conscripts
several months in advance, and thou
sands of them will seek release from
duty which means probable death.
The military census shows this year
1 S2.757 "men" nil lads under 20 years
of nge liable to be tl rafted into the
service. Of these 20,777 are exempted
for physical disability, 2,1,11 are tem
porarily exempted, 0,208 are missing,
W.O.W are held conditionally, liable for
rervipc, and 90,525 lire actually sum
moned for active service. The places
of such of these hitter ns ptii't'luise ex
rmption $.100 from homo service and
?4il0 from colonial service will be filled
from the ranks of those conditionally
drafted. Jn'o loss than 40,000 of these un
seasoned lads, after' two or three
months of drill, are to be sent to Culm.
the first of them arriving there befor"
Christmas. Such are the troops with
which eylcr hoies to crush the veter
an legions of dompz nnd Macro! i!v
sneh measures Spain has swelled her
army to 300.000 men and boys In two
yon i s. In 19 months she lias scut 105,
j.M of them to Culm. There were nl-
ready there some 12,000 nnd 15,000 morf
volunteers, making n total of 192,551.
This number has now been reduced tn
less thnn 150,000, showing a fearful
number of deaths and disabilities on
the (ielil nnd in the hospital.
Hesidi'S this appalling drain upon the
young manhood of the nation, there is
n corresponding drain upon the treas
ury. Nineteen months of war have
cost fully $90,000,000 and the present
rale of expense is $11,000,000 n month.
And still the end is not in sight. The
insurgents are actually stronger than
ever before, in spite of nil the wealth
and blood spent upon their subjection.
Iliey have, says this Corresnontletit,
in unlimited recruiting ground in the
majority of the Creole population,
whites nnd colored people alike, nnd nn
inexhaustible supply of arms, money
and nnimiiuifion from their friends a nil
mnpnthizrrs in the United States.
That is quite true anil they will doubt
less continue to enjoy these advantage!
until the waning resources of Spain are
completely exhausted.--?:. YYrrilimic
