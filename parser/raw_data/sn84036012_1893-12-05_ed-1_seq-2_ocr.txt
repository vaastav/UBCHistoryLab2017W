Theholiday trade will lie MM Mall^than the nterrliutits in the cities of^Montana had antu'i]iatt^l. The times^^re pretty good; things are looking up.^Advert In your w ares. I,et the people^know what you have to oiler, ami use^the Stam^ai!I^, the newspaper the j^eo-^pie read, tor your announcements.^The circulation of the m \\i^\i:i^ is a^hundred per cent, larger than that of^Bny other newspaper in Montana.
ItWould he a little odd If the recent^work of the federal grand jury that^met in Helena was to he thrown out^on the technicality mentioned in one^Of this mornings dispatches under^temporary-capital date. The lawyer*^who are defending the Northern Pa^^cific train robliers think they have dis^^covered a kink in the code which will^make invalid the indictments found^by the jury. It will he annoying to^the public if these lawyers make their^point stick- it will put the people to^just so much more expense in bringing^the miscreants to punishment.
Theman who started the story that^the wool growers of Montana are sat^^isfied with free wool, must have got^his information at the wrong shop.^If what is said by many of the news^^papers in Kastern Montana is true,^most of the wool growers, so far from^being reconciled to the proposed tanlt^change, are dead in earnest in their^opposition to free list wool. We M^^lieve it was our Helena contemporary,^the /iuli/^ ml) nt, in which the state^^ment hud its start that the wool men^are not anxious for the tai ill protec^^tion of their product. Manifestly,^the assertion is a great many miles^from the truth and the facts in the^case.
Itis the ascertained truth that the^llutte library fund isn't going to dance^Itself into opulence. The library^needed a lift and needed it badly.^Some of its friends felt very sure that^a grand MMlM hall would give it^ready cash in the sum of three or four^thousand dollars; indeed, five thousand^wouldn't have surprised them. The^ball was great. The occasion was au^^spicious, t he t icket s went like hot cakes,^the patronage Thanksgiving uiglit^was simply a crush id' people it was a^lug success. Hut the fruits: alas, the^fruits. The members of the library^committee sal down last night to fig^^ure up the net results They think^they have two hundred dollars in^sight. Hut. then, all receipts are not^yet in; neither are all the lulls.
Ingland (lot In Ahead.
Howon earth did H happen that^London got hold of the president's^message ahead of New York. This^morning's stock-exchange dispatch^says that the message was printed in^London in advance of its sending to^congress, and the New York market^felt a depressing effect as the result^thereof, the loreigners learning that^the message did not include a recom^^mendation for a new issue of bond.-.^Whether there is anything in that, as^an excuse lor a heavy market on the^opening day in congress, is not for us^to nay. Hut, in any event, those gold-^bug Londoners are clever, very i lever;^they seem to be right on the inside ol^things |^ertuining to the Cleveland ad^^ministration. I'ossiluy Carlisle sent^the message over m order to get the^Koglish Ok K for il before it was^spread lief ore the rest of us.
Thatthe message should have tieen^printed in London hours earlier than^thii country's newspapers were per^^mitted to publish it, seems strange.^Many newspapers m the 1'nited States^were in possession of its full text at^an early hour yesterday morning. It^consists of about fifteen thousand^words which were wired from the^Last. These were taktn oil by the two^telegraph operators in regular service^in the Sr\.m^ai:i^ oll'iee who, after a^steady grind of several hours, limshcd^their type-written task, in the m ami-^a UK's copy of the complete message,^soon after 7 o'clock yesterday morn^^ing.
'Ihe president's message is always^sent to the press of the country with^the compliments of the Western I 'tuou^Telegraph company. There ure no^tolls for this service; it is an old-time^gratuity of the Western I nion. Of^course, there is great advantage in the^prompt |K^8session of the ^copy,^ hut a^promise is always exacted that no^iiewspa|k-r shall put before the public^the message or any part of it until^word is telegraphed that it is released.
Thatword is sent as soon as the mes^^sage is before congress. A president's^message it always worth printing in^full. This year's message is of little^value If put out in a summary. The^Standard prints it word for word, and^makes it a part of this morning's^twelve-page edition.
Mr.Cleveland's Message.
Theman who reads the president's^message will go through many columns^of It before he comes upon any of the^peculiarities in style or diction that^distinguish whatever Mr. Cleveland^writes. A few sentences relating to^the civil service rules aud one or two^that touch upon the turiff question^are the only betrayals of the presi^^dent's style.
Themessage lucks in suggestions.^It disposes ol Hawaii ill short order -^the only information is that the presi^^dent is waiting for news from his nun^idler; It is colorless on the Chinese^question; its reference to depression^in financial circles is merely inciden^^tal. There is no silver in the message,^the inference conveyed by the presi^^dent is that nothing intelligent can be^done respecting the currency until the^country has had more experience -he^is for doing nothing. He doesn't even^speak in praise of what the extra ses^^sion did, nor docs he take so much as^a shy at the repeal measure. In the^way of enrrency l^ (filiation, the presi^^dent has no suggestions to offer.
Mr.Cleveland is firm In his demand^for tariff reform, lie is no Iree (ruder,^he evidently approves the lull prepared^by the Wilson commit tee, and lie in^^sists that the democratic party is^pledged to see the thing through along^the lines of the committee's bill. The^emphatic utterances in the message^ugainst fraudulent pensions merit the^applause of every patriotic man. All^the assurances given by Commissioner^Itaum, two or three years ago, of a^gradual reduction in the annual pen^^sion appropriations are proving to be^idle- tins year's payments will run up^to the stupendous total of .SI^m.^IU^,^sMI.^Iteforni in the civil service gets a good^word in the message. The president^says he is for it, and a sentence in his^message sounds rathe.- odd when it^says that Mr. Cleveland has noticed^the salutary effect of the reform ^in^elevating the tone of political life gen^^erally;^ the country hud quite forgot^^ten that Mr. Cleveland is a civil-ser^^vice reformer.
Asidefrom its ample survey of this^country's foreign relations, the mess^^age is, in larger measure than is usu^^ally the case, a ^lig^st of the reports of^the cabinet officers. The president^counsels the measure of prudence^suited to hard times in increasing the^navy; he reviews the facts and figures^in the secretary of war's report; he^commends the prudent policy pursued^by I'ostmuster (ieneral Hissell;aud he^ptfslfjsj the reform measures inaugu^^rated In the department of agricul^^ture. Indeed, Farmer Morton is per^^mitted to turn himself loose in the^columns of the message, lie proposes^to stop the indiscriminate scattering^of ordinary flower and vegetable seeds,^and he wants the country to fix its^eye on Ins reform doings.
I'uttogether in the manner we have^described, the president's message is^not wliut would be called a masterly^^IMS paper there is little of discus^^sion or of recommendation In it. Hut,^as a running summary of our domes^^tic aIIaiis. our loieign relations, our^resources, our national equipment aim^our needs, it is a valuable coinpend.^It is not fashionable to read presi^^dents' messages, the nervous Amen-^can public finds them too long Hut^here Is a message so abundant in its^volume of informal ion, that every^man ought to read it w ho w ants to^know what every intelligent man^ought to know about his country and^its current history.
ProfessorTyndall's Death.
Inthe death of I'rofessor Tyndall,^the world of science and letters sutlers^a severe bereavement He ranked^with Mill, Darwin. Huxley, Spencer^and the others whose contributions to^modern philosophy have helped to^make luminous the literature of our^time. It is given to few of us to walk^the intellectual heights which these^men trod. Tliey rank as scientists, but^the fruit of their genius suems more t he^result of an intuition than the product^of patient plodding study; they have a^sort of inspiration which the masses^ol men. even in the world ol scholars,^do not sh ire
ProfessorTyndall's early career was^in no seme phenomenal -it was hardly^successful. He rambled a good while^before In- Ills work unfolded He was^coming up close to middle life before^the path opened before him which he^followed till it brought Iiiin to bril^^liant achievement. Of him, a discern^^ing critic has lately written: ^Pro^^fessor Tyndall's cast of mind not only^attracted him to the deeper questions^of the time, but Ins courageous temper^led Dim to deal with them candidly^and fearlessly.^ Pit si of all a devotee^of science and a lover of truth, he gave^to these his sole allegiance.
ProfessorTyndall has been a splendid^eolit i ibulor to the literature of^modern plnloso| hv. lie w is a man of^SMpStfb lent a I gifts. Iiyiugat the age^of 7:1 years, he w dl b- remenib red as^one of the ripest scholars of his tune.
AtW ork Again.
TheFifty-thud congress nude its^organization complete when its inem-^Ihts met in extra session so that ut^yesterday's assembling both houses^were ready tor routine work. Presi^^dent Cleveland's message was received^without demonstration, and nothing^hap|iened worth noting, except that^ex ^peuker Heed made Ins presence^conspicuous enough to secure for him^^self a personal mention in the dis^^patches. He likes that sort of thing.
Jtwill probably be a long session, al
though,if the members of the ma^^jority have good political sense, they^will be exceedingly tender with the^people's money and vote appropria^^tions sparingly. That is the policy^urged by the president and strongly re^^flected in the annual reports of the^cabinet officers.
Asidefrom the tariff discussion,^there are no questions up that involve^the likelihood of an unusually pro^^longed session. The words of the^president, In bis message, are a broad-^enough hint that silver will get no^chance during the session, and It is^probable that limitations will be put^upon the time to be devoted to the^tariff debate. If on pending matters^the democrats pull together, they can^push their work,.unless a bit of a war^is developed out of the Hawaiian^rumpus.

Onc-eliefore, we reached a similar pitch^of national consciousness in war. Young,^unprepared, divided against ourselves, we^ton ml ourselves able to mass great armies,^endure long strains, organize campaigns,^e.miitiissarl.its. hospitals, in altogether in^^dependent ways, and on a scale greater^than F.uro|^e had seen. Then men and^women alike learned the value of mutual^confidence, the strength of cooperation^und organization. Unco again now,^but this tune in tho interest of^heau'v and of peace, we have studied^the art of subordinating fragmentary in^^terests to those of a whole. The training^we have received as a nation in producing^and studying the fair, must result in a^deeper national dignity, which wall botn^tree us trom irritating sensitiveness over^loreigu criticism, and give us readiness to^learn from other countries whatever les^^sons they can teaeti.

Prof.Henry Drummond writes, in .!/^^^^('/^(^^^'^ HagSStSM for December, ol the^^Hoy's llngade^ as follows;
l.etus suppose ^ on have gathered a^number of Uiys together and treat them^at tirst on the old or tiuic-.li*houoivd plan^of having a liihle class for them on Nun-^ilay s. Intitule trouble and intitule brib^^ery hove brought these creatures together,^and as tliov come solely to amuse them^^selves, your whole effort is spent in keep,^lug order in i|iielling riots, sulsliiing ir*^relfvaut remarks, iiiinuuiz.ng ai lacks^ii|k*ii the person, and protecting your^Sunday hat from destruction. No set 1^am not speaking of an orditiar^ Sunday^^Shawl class, tint of a gamin etas- - has^yet succeeded in listening to you for^two consecutive minutes. They have^learned nothing whatever. licspect^is unknown, obedience a jest.^F.ven the minor virtues of regularity,^punctuality, and courtesy have not yet^dawned upon their virgin minds. What^is w rong is that they are street Iwv s, ami^you have treated them as if ihey had the
motivesand interests of domestic boys.^The real boy nature in them has never^been consulted. You may be a very re^^markable man, but it is not their kind of^remarkahleness, so you are a person of no^authority in their eyes. Tliey bell eve you^to be a thoroughly good fellow in your^way, only it is an earth's diameter from^their way; and that you should know pre^^cisely what their way is tbey guilelessly^give you opportunity of learning every^single second you spend among them.
Onenight, after the usual entente, you^retire from the place of torture vowing to^attempt some change. Next morning you^betake yourself to the Headquarters of tho^New Process and determine to explore its^secret. The whole art and mystery of^making I toys is explained to you: tho^whole process of cleaning, restoring and^renovating them; of clothing them and^putting them into a right mind, of giving^them a sound body and reasonable soul.^And at your preparation hour, the follow^^ing Saturday night, instead of trying to^find out whether tho Israelites crossed the^Hud Sea by the shoals at Suez or went^round, ^as some say,^ by Wady Tnwarik,^you read up the literature of the ^M il.^^and learn how the children of your own^city can be led across the more dillicult^sea of life's temptation.
TRYING IT ON,^Startling Sensation I'rcxliiced by a Heavy

Fromt'itssler's .Magazine.
fvlisoti'sOrange laboratory, despite its^pastoral surroundings and the pacilic na^^ture of its habitues, has been the scene of^some grewsome experiments. Wtien the^new law was passed enlisting electricity^as an agent of death, Mr. Kdisou w as con^^sul ted as to the best method of applying^that mysterious and dendly fluid, and in^the experiments made by him to test the^comparativo action of thfl'orcnt cut-routs^ut various intensities, many painful ani^^mal executions were necessary.
Mr.Kdison's most valuable friend and^assistant. Charles Haehelor. barely evaded^the distinction of ollicialuig as a sacrifice^on the altar of experimental science. He^was mending some defective apparatus in^connection with a lamp.and. as it seemed^to him at the time, bad taken all imagin^^ary precautions against an accident. Ho^supposes, however, from the pressenco of^a burn afterwards found on one of his^lingers, that he must unconsciously have^established a circuit by holding a^wire in each band. No sooner had^he made tho contact than he stag-^gored back to a stool, with^the awful memory of soul and body^wrentched violently asunder, with such^pangs us the Mohammedan death angels^v.-reek on the awakening spirits of the^damned. He describe* it as resembling^the sensations of un immense rough file^thrust through the quivoring libers of the^Ixsly, a shuddering, rasping pang, grind^^ing Ms way through lungs and heart. For^over I i minutes tie sat motionless, bathed^ill au icy and death-like sweat, ami ner^^vously unstrung from head to foot. Yet,^strange to say, ttie shock passed away in^a day or two. leaving no visible injury ex^^cept in the memory of the victim.
