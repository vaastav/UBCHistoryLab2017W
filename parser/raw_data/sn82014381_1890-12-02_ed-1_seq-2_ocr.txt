THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The message of President Harrison is
affirmatively strong in presenting his ad
ministration as having in the best manner
and most actively conserved the highest
interesU of the country.
Generally, it reviews the condition of
the nation in detail and compares the fis
cal year just closed with preceding years,
to show that the United States enjoys a
higher degree of prosperity now than at
any previous period. Our export trade,
he shows, has exceeded that of any year in
our history, excepting only one. This ex
port trade has been mainly of agricultural
products, fully $100.000,0.0 of the $11.,
--000,000 gain over 1888-1) being of that
class. The bu.iuess failures have been .00
less and the liabilities of trade §-000,000
lielow those of the preceding fiscal year.
Upon this head the President dwells at
considerable length, maintaining with
much vigor that our industrial, product
ive and financial conditions are upon a
present high plane of prosperity, and
premise for the future all that can be
reasonably desired.
Concerning the recent disturbance in
fiuancial circles, he asserts that it was not
due to any want of faith in American se
curities, but to the need of a foreign mar
ket to realize upon them, which induced
their return to us. He dwells upon the
Barrundia affair but little, simply saying
that -Minister Mizner exceeded his author
ity, which necessitated his recall, as he
was not warranted in interfering, as re
quested, to aid in the taking of Barrundia,
who was in transit and charged with po
litical offenses.
The Bekring Sea matter is referred to
as unsettled pending negotiation for abasis
of permanent settlement. But the Presi
dent indicates that the policy of the Gov
ernment will he adhesive to the claim
that (ireat Britain must recognize our
property right in the sea, as acquired from
Russia, and which right in Russia and
the United States has been for more than
eighty years undi.-pt.ted.
Portugal was brought to satisfactory
arbitration of the Delagoa Bay affair, in
which the rights of an American investor
were involved, who claimed our protec
tion. With all nations our relations are
peaceful, and the early future promises as
to several of them much closer commercial
and more reciprocal relations than now
exist.
The Nicaragua Canal he r . .rts as pro
gressing satisfactorily under American en
terprise. And such is our connection with
Mexico that he advises the raising of our
mission to that country to the rank of
the first class. Consular supervision is
urged, as heretofore, and especial stress is
laid upon the importance of this subject ns
demanding immediate legislation. The
silver legislation lias been faithfully car
ried out, and with satisfactory results.
He warns Congress, however, against im
pulsive legislation that may neutralize the
advantage our large supply of gold gives
us, and prevent what he believes will be
consummated, the free use of silver as an
international agency.
The financial condition of the nation is
set forth in totals, and the President finds
it to be entirely satisfactory, and to reflect
credit upon his administration. Coast de
fensive works of magnitude have hi., ap
proval, and he points with pride also to
the growing proportions of the new navy,
to the general improvement in the army,
and urges greater liberality by the Fed
eral Government in promoting the effi
ciency of the organized militia, which Le
well terms the real army of the United
States.
He points out that the internal
revenue during the last fiscal year
increased about $12,000,000, but that
the cost of its collection was effected
by $90,017 less than in the preced
ing year, and at less cost than ever be
fore. He credits the policy of the admin
istration with having increased the circu
lation of money $93.880,814, or about .1 -Vi
per capita, and adds that only about 57,
--100,000 of this is to be attributed to silver
legislation,
The administration of the Postal and
Agricultural Departments is warmly c- jin .
mended and much space is g';, cn to cita
tions to show that new jmJ profitable
fields are opening to the farmers, as for in
stance in the culture of the sugar beet,
and that agricultural products are receiv
ing augmented prices. Attention is called
to the fraud-; perpetrated in naturalization,
and Congress is asked to pass iaws to re
quire severer inquiry iuto the claims of
applicants for admi.-sion to the privileges
of citizenship.
A hint at the cause of the threatening
attitude of the Sioux tribes of Indians is
given in the statement that Congress neg
lected to appropriate sufficient money to
enable the Government to keep the con
tract solemnly made with the tribes, by
which the cession of certain lands were
made to the United States.
While be comc-ends the attitude of the
head of the Mormon Church regarding
polygamy, he warns Congress that that
church has not agreed to refrain
from teaching the doctrine of plural j
marriage, but only to refrain from its prac
tice. A national bankruptcy law is ad
vised, and early legislation in favor of
arid lands. He would have the United
States survey aud prevent the occupancy
of water rights, and so legislate as to enable
all actual settlers to avail freely of sources
of water supply to reclaim arid lands.
Coming to the tariff question, he insists
with emphar.is that the new tariff law is
not chargeable with the rise in prices, and
declares that the proof of this is that,
prior to the passage of the bill, there was
a legitimate upward tendency. He insists
tha. the bill should not be judged until it
has had fairer and more extended trial,
especially, he add*, as some of its provisions
have not yet gone into effect. It i_ signifi
cant that the President dwells upon the
question of reciprocity, and very frequent
ly returns to it as a policy that is not to
be limited to any particular nation, or that
is to be circumscribed by sentiment. In
less we wi.ti.ke the real tenor of the Presi
dent's expressions—read in telegraphic
manuscript—upon this topic, there is a
decided drift in the message towards
the establishment of reciprocal commer
cial relations with any nation, when we
can secure full compensating advantages
in a foreign market, for the admission free
to our own of the products of that foreign
country which we do not produce to the
best advantage. While the President de
fends the recent tariff legislation, and be-
lieves that it haa been unfairly assaulted,
and much misunderstood, it is clear that
he considers reciprocity the curative for
most tariff ills complained of, and that he
is preparing the way for a very broad read
ing and practice of the reciprocal policy.
In this connection he urges with force
such extension of aid to American steam
ship lines carrying the United States mails
as will bring this nation into harmony
with the tradition of Great Britain, that
''trade follows the flag." His advice upon
this topic is fortified by frequent references
to the necessity for liberality in this di
rection as an efficient means of carrying
out a policy of reciprocity.
Congress is told very plainly that, in
President Harrison's opinion, an electoral
supervision law for all elections involving
Federal offices, which the Democracy
terms "a force bill," is a necessity; that
it will not be a new departure; that it
will not invade the jurisdiction of honest
Election Board., nor deprive electors of
any right or privilege, or cow or hamper
them in the exercise of the supreme act of
sovereiguty. Upon this subject the Presi
dent wSxes not only eloquent, but plainly
manifests his indignation over the criti
cisms with which the Lodge bill has met.
lie explains how the marketing of our
meats in Europe has been conserved by
tbe appointment of veterinary surgeons by
the United States, to inspect the arrivals
of our meat exports abroad. With this
inspection in the foreign port, and inspec
tion at home, not only is the liability of
the shipment of diseased food effectually
prevented, but the animus of any foreign
complaint against such products wiil be
revealed.
These are the main topics treated in the
messpge, which is a rather full and ex
tended review of the business and policies
of the country, and which, without being
a great state paper, is a straightforward
understandable presentation of the condi
tion of the nation and the views of the
Administration concerning the national
policy. Consideration ol the document in
a critical spirit is reserved.
THE CITRUS FAIRS.
The Record-Union yesterday extend
edly set forth the reasons why the two
citrus fairs should be located respectively
at .Marysville and Los Angeles for this
season. Further consideration of the sub
ject emphasizes the conclusions then
reached. The fairs will, we trust, be
placed at the points indicated, (lood
faith in the one case as well as other wise
reasons relating to citrus fruit culture, and
the plainly evident wisdom of selecting
Los Angeles in the second place, for com
mercial, transportation and natural rea
sons, lead us to hope that the State Board
of Agriculture will act to-day wisely in
locating the expositions. If it does,
Marysville and Los Angeles will be
selected for the reasons we set forth in de
tail yesterday and which to us seem irre
sistible.
The - President's message, which we
present in full this morning, was for
warded to the press with the compliments
of the Associated Press, William Henry
Smith, General Manager The favor is
duly appreciated, and the promptness of
its transmission acknowledged. It was
sent over the wires hy the Western Union
Company, and taken by the Sacramento
operators with clearness and furnished in I
excellent form for publication.
FIFTY-FIRST CONGRESS.
The Formal Opi.i_i._2 of the Second
Session.
Washin -ton-, December Ist—Congress con
vened at 12 o'clock to -day. At 11 o'clock a large
number of Representatives had arrived on the
floor. Every one seemed in good humor and
the Democrats and Republicans bandied jokes
and mineled together good-naturedly. The
Democrats, of course, twitted their opponent*
about their defeat in the recent elections, but
the latter took it all in good humor aud every
body seemed happy aud eager for the coming
fray. Absurd as it may appear, it really seemed
as if the crowded galleries were waitiugfora
matinee or a prizo-light or a baseball game to
begin. No oue seemed conscious of the fact
that the popular legislative body of the greate.-t
Governmeut on earth \va3 about to set agoing
its ponderous law-:i:aking machinery. Most of
the leaders on both siies were in their seats.
SENATE.
Wa-hingtos, December Ist.—There was an
unusually large attendance ol fccnators at tne
opening of to day's session. The seats on both
6ides of the chamber were nearly all occupied
au.l the galleries were fi.lcd. Cordiality seemed
to prevail between the Senators of the parties,
who greeted each other as the best of irieuds,
whom no political successes or reverses could
estrange.
Immediately after the Chaplain's piaver, the
credentials oi the Seuators-eleC ffA.n Tt\vw« . n » n

2 ii o'clock, adjourned until to-morrow.
THE HOUSE.
W..sh!__ton, December Ist.—With the o__eep
'.'lima few seats reserved for the President's
family and the liiplomatic Corps, every avail
able seat in the vnst galleries which surround
the Chamber of the House was occupied carlv
in the forenoon by spectators eager to witness
tbe proceedings attending the opening of the
second session of the Fifty-tirst Congress. The
stairs leading to the wide portals were utilized
ns resting-plsccs and the opening doors fur
nished "standin?room<mly" io belated arrivals.
A dull, leadeu sky, which overhung the city,
served to ma c tbe hall rather gloomy, but the
gloom was almost dissipated by roars of
laughter which cmc from the cloak-rooms and
by the animated conversation wbich took place
upon the floor. The Democrats 6p_e__..y \ v ere
joyous, and the Republicans were obliged to
put up with a great deal of goodunlured
badgering with smiling countenances. A ta«-e
--fnl pyramid of flowers adorned the Speaker's
desk.
At noon Speaker Reed entered the hall and a
rap of the gavel instantly restored order.
After prayer by the Chaplain, the Clerk pro
ceeded to call the roll by States. The call dis
closed the presence of -_7 members and the
Clerk was directed to inform the Senate that a
i.uorum of the House appeared and the body
was ready to proceed to business
On motion of Cannon of Illinois a resolution
was adopted for the appointment of a committee
to joiu a similar committee on the part of the
Senate to wait upon the President and notify
I im that Congress was read/ to receive any
communication he may see fit to transmit.
The Speaker stated that there were various
credentials upon his table which he would pre
sent to the House. The credentials were then
read as follows: C. R. Breckinridge Second
Atkansas: Willis Sweet, Idaho; T. W. Stone.
Tweuth-seventh Pennsylvania, aud Clarence D.
Clark ol Wyoming. These g-.nllemen then ap
iwared at the Bar of the House aud were duly

York district: E. R. Haye«. from the Seventh
lowa, and Robert Whitelaw, from the Four
teenth Missouri, were qua ifled as Representa

The Speaker laid before the House the cre
dentials of David A. Harvey as Deleg.tc from
the Tertitor.- of Oklahoma, and upon moil in ol
lerklns of Kansas, the oath of office was ad
ministered to him.
The House then took'a recess until 1:30 to al
