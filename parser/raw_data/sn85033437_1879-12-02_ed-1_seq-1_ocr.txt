PRE3IDENT3 ME33AGE.
Following is a synopsis of Presi
dent Hayes' message, read in both
houses at the assembling of the Forty-
Sixth Congress yesterday :
He congratulates Congress on the suc
cessful execution of the Resumption act.
The demand upon the Treasury for gold
and silver in exchange for United States
notes has been comparatively small, and
the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion
in exchange for notes has been very large.
The excess of the precious metals depos
ited or exchanged for United States notes
over the amount of United States notes re
deemed is about forty million dollars. He
refers to the consequent revival of trade,
and says the increasing foreign demand for
our manufacturers' and agricultural pro
ducts has caused a large balance of trade
in our favor, which has been paid in gold,
from the first of July last to November
15th, to the amount of $59,C30,0CD. Since
the resumption of specie payments there
has also been a marked and gratifying im
provement of the public credit. The
bonds of the Government, bearing only
four per cent, interest, have been sold at or
above par sufficient in amount to pay off
all of the National debt, which was re
deemable under - present laws. The
amount of interest saved annually by this
process of refunding the debt since March
1st, 1877, is $14,297,177. The bonds sold
were largely in small sums, and the
number of our citizens now holding the
public securities is much greater than ever
before. The amount of the National debt
which matures within less than two years
is $;92,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bears
interest at the rate of five per cent., and
the balance is in bonds bearing six per
cent, interest. It is believed that this part
of the public debt can be refunded by the
issue of four per cent, bonds, and by the
reduction of interest which will thus be
effected, about eleven million dollars can
be annually saved to the Treasury.
To secure this important reduction of
interest paid by the United States,- fur
ther legislation is required, which, it is
hoped will be provided by Congress dur
ing its present session. The coinage of
gold by the mints of the United States dur
ing the last fiscal year, was $40,986,912.
The coinage of silver dollars since the pas
sage of the act for that purpose to Novem
ber 1st, 1879, wa3 $45,000,850, of which
$12,700,344 have been issued from the
Treasury and are now in circulation and
$32,300,506 are still in the possession of the
Government. The pending of the propo
sition for a union of action between the
United States and the principal-commercial
nations of Europe, to the effect that a
permanent system for the equality of gold
and silver ia the recognized money of the
world, leads me to recommend that Con
gress refrain from new legislation on the
general subject. The great revival of trade,
internal and foreign, will supply, during
the coming year, its own instructions,
which may well be awaited before attempt
ing further experimental measures with
the coinage. I would, however, strongly
urge upon Congress the importance of au
thorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to
suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon
the present legal rates. Tho market value
of the silver dollar being uniformly and
largely lless than the market value of the
gold dollar, it is obviously impracticable to
maintain them at par with ach other, it
both are coined without limit. If the
cheaper coin is forced into circulation it
will, if coined without limit, soon become
the sole standard of value, and thus defeat
the desired object, which is a currency of
both gold and silver, which shall be of
equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the
universally recognized money of the world,
lha retirement from circulation of United
Slates notes with the capacity oflegal ten
der in private contracts, is a step to be taken
in oUr progress toward a safe and stable
currency, which should be accepted as the
policy and duty of the Government and the
interest and eecunty oi the people, it is my
firm conviction that the issue of legal
tender paper money, based wholly
upon the authority and credit of theGovern-
mnt, except in extreme emergency, is
without warrant in the Constitution, r.nd a
viulatioa of sound financial principle?.
The issue of United States notes during
the late civil war, with the capacity of le
gal tende.r between private individuals
was not authorized, except as a means of
rescuing the country from imminent peril.
The circulation of these notes as paper
money for any protracted period of time
after the accomplishment of this purpose,
was not contemplated by the framers of the
law under which they were issued. They
anticipated the redemption and withdrawal
of these notes at the earliest practicable
period. Uonsiaent with the attainment oi
the object for wnichthey were provided.the
policy of the United fctates, steadily ad
hered to from the adoption of the Consti
tution, has been to avoid the creation of a
National debt, and when from necessity
in the time of war debts have been crea
ted, they have been paid off on the return of
peace as rapidly as possible. VVith this
iew and lor this purpose, it is recom
mended that the existing laws for the ap
cumulation of a sinking fund sufficient
to extinguish the public debt within a
limited neroid be maintained.
If any change of the objects or rales of
taxation is deemed necessary by Uongress,
it is suggestbd that experience has known
that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee
which will not enhance the price of these
articles to the consumer, and which will
add several millions of dollars annually to
the Treasury.
On the subject cf polygamy the Presi
dent says: Utah has a population
sufficient to entitle it to admission as a
State, and the general interests of the Na-
tion, as well as the welfare of the citizens of
the ierntory, require its advance from the
territorial torm of government to the re
sponsibilities and privileges of a btate
This important change, however, will not
be approved by the country, while the
citizens of Utah, in a very considerable
number, uphold a practice which is con
demed as a crime by the laws of all civil
ized communities throughout the world
He mentions that the law for the sunnres-
sion of polygamy has now been decided by
the Supreme Court as to be within the leg
islative power of Congress, and binding, as
a ru'e of action for nil who reside within
the Territories. There is no longer
any reason for delay or hesi
tation in its enforcement. It
should be firmly and effectually exe
cuted. If not lumciently strong mis pro
visions it should be amended, and in aid
of the purpose in view I recommend
that more comprehensive and mors search
ing methods for preventing as well as pun
ishing this crime be provided. If nee
essary to secure obedience to the law: the
enjoyment and exercise of the rights and
privileges of citizenship in the territories
of the United States may be withheld or
withdrawn from those who violate or od-
pose the enforcement of the law on this
subject.
xne elections ot the past year,
though occupied only with State officers,
have not failed to elicit, in the political
discussions which have attended them all
over the country, new and decisive evi
dence of the deep interest which the great
body of citizens take in the progress of the
country toward a more general and com
plete establishment at whatever erst, of
universal security and freedom in the ex
ercise of the elective franchise. While
many topics of political concern demand
great attention from our people, both in
tbe sphere of National and State authority,
I find no reason to qualify the opinion I
expressed in my last annual message, that
no temporary or administrative interests
ofthe Government, however urgent or
weighty, will ever display the zeal of our
people in defense of the primary rights of
citizenship, and mat tne power oi public
opinion will override all political prejudice
and all sectional and State attachments, in
demanding that, all over our wide territory,
the name and character of a citizen of the
United States shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry with them unchallenged
security and respect. I earnestly appeal
to the intelligence and pattiotism of all
good citizens of every part of the country,
however much they may be divided in
opinions on other political subjects, to
unite in compelling obedience to existing
laws aimed at the protection of the right
of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Con
gress to supply any defects in these laws
which experience has shown, and which it
is within its power to remedy. I again
invoke the co-operation of the exec
utive and legislative authorities of
the States in this great purpose.
I am fully convinced that if the public
mind can bVset at rest on this paramount
question of popular rights, no serious ob
jection wili thwart or delay the complete
pacification ofthe country or retard the
general diffusfon of prosperity.
On the subject of civil service re
form, which the President treats
at some length, he says : "In
view of the facts that during a consid
erable period the government of Great
Britain has been dealing with administra
tive problems and abuses in various par
ticulars analogous to those presented in this
country, and that in recent years J.he meas
ures adopted were understood to have been
effective and in every respect highly satis
factory, I thought it desirable to have
fuller information upon the subject, and
accordingly requested the chairman of the
Civil Service Commission to make a thor
ough investigation for this purpose. Tho
result has been an elaborate and compre
hensive report. The report sets forth the
history of the partisan spoils system in
Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of the
Parliamentary patronage and of official
interference witn the freedom of elections.
It shows. that after long trials of various
kinds of examinations.and open on equal
terms to all, and which are carried on
under the superintendence of a single
commission, have with great advantage
been established as conditions of admission
to almost every official place in the subor
dinate administration of that country of
British India. The completion of the re
port, owing to the extent of labor involved
in its preparation, and the omission of Con
gress to make any provision either for tho
composition or the expenses of the com
mission, has been postponed until the pres
ent time. It is herewith transmitted to
Congress. While the reform measures of
another government are of no authority for
us, they are entitled to influence to the ex
tent to which their intrinsic wisdom and
their adaptation to our institutions
and social life may commend
them to our consideration. Tho
views I have heretofore expressed
concerning the defects and abuses in our
civil administration remain unchanged.ex
cept in so far as enlarged experience has
opened my sense of the duty of both the
officers and of the people themselves to co
operate for their removal. A large and re
sponsible part of the duty of restoring the
civil service to the desired purity and effi
ciency rests upon the President, and it has
been my purpose to do what is within my
power to advance such prudent and grad
ual measures of reform as will most surely
and rapidly bring about tho radical cnange
ui oyoucui essential 10 make our adminis
trative methods satisfactory to a free and
intelligent people. By a proper exercise of
authority, it is in the power of the Execu
tive 10 ao mucu to promote such a reform,
but it can not bo too clearly understood
that nothing adequate can be accomplished
without co-operation on tho part of Con
gress and a considerate and intelligent
support among the people.
He refers to the work of the Civil Ser
vice Commission and the failure of Con
gress to appropriate money for the re
sumption of the work of the Com
On the subject of competitive examinations
tor omce ne 8ys : 1 think the economy,
purity and efficiency of the public service
would be greatly promoted by their sys
tematic introduction wherever practical) e
throughout the entire civil service of the
Government, together with ample provis
ions in order to secure consistency and uni
form justice. Reports of examinations
heretofore made show that the results have
been salutary in a marked degree, and that
the general application of similar rules can
not fail to be of decided benefit to the ser
vice. I deem it my duty to renew the re
commendation contained in my annual
message or lecemDer, 1877, requesting
Congress to make the neccessary appro
priations for the resumption of the work of
the Civil Service Commission. Economy
will be promoted by authorizing a moder
ate compensation to persons in the public
service who may perform extra labors
upon or under the Commission as the
Executive may direct. It may not be ea-y.
ana it may never, perhaps, be necessary,
to define with precision the proper limit of
political action on tho part of Federal
officers; but, while their right to hold and
freely express their opinions can not bo
questioned, it is very plain that they should
neither be allowed to devote to fthr sub
jects the timo needed for tho proper dis-
cuarge ot tneir omcial duties, nor to use
the authority of their office to enforce their
own opinions, or to coerce the political ac
tions of those who hold different opinions.
Keasons of justice ar.d public policy, quite
analogous to those which forbid the use
of official power for the oppression of
mo privaie citizen, impose upon tne
Government the duty of protecting
its officers and agents from arbitrary ex
actions, from whatever aspect considered.
The practice of miking levies for party pur
poses, upon the salaries of officers, is high
ly demoralizing to the public service and
discreditable to the country. Though an
officer should be as free as any other citi
zen to givo his own money in aid of his
opinions or his party, he should also be as
free a3 any other citizen to refuse to maite
such gifts. If salaries are but a fair com
pensation for time and labor, it is gross in
justice, &c, &c.
Tho President calls a' tontion to foreirn
affairs, showing that we .are at peace with
all the world. He calls attention to the re
ports of the heads of departments, dis
cusses tho Indian fquestion and cloe3 bv
calling attention to District of Columbia
anairs.
Benefactors.
When a board of eminent physicians
and chemists announced the discovery
that, by combining some well-known,
valuable remedies, the most wonderful
medicine was produced, which would
cure such a wide range of diseases that
most all other remedies could be dis
pensed with, many were sceptical ; but
proof of its merits by actual trial has
dispelled all doubt, and today the dis
coverers of that great medicine, Hop
Bitters, are honored and blessed by
all as benefactors.
