WAEHING GIVEN IN PBESI
DENT'S MESSAGE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Stern
warning is given in the President's
message read in Congress, Tuesday,
to the advocates of radicalism and
re(L doctnnes, and Russia, "with
its blood and terror," was pointed
out as a "painful object lesson of the
power of minorities."
"There are those in this country,"
said the message, "who threaten di
rect action to force their will upon a
majority. It makes little differ
ence what minority it is; whether
capital or labor, or any other class;
no sort of privilege will ever be per-
tiubbcu mi uuuiiuaie inis country."
Orderly processes, the message de
clared, were the only ones by which
relief and reform could be obtained.
"Those who would propose any
other method of reform are enemies
of this country," the- message aid.
Let those beware who take the
shorter road" of disorder and revolu
tion." Notable among his recommenda
tions is one for measures which will
"remove the causes" of political rest
lessness in our body politic, declar
ing that those causes were "super
ficial rather than deep seated." The
message was read to the Congress by
clerks the President's illness prevent
ing his delivering the address in per
son. fc
Referring to the causes of the un
rest he declared that they "arise from
or are connected with the failure on
the part of our Government to arrive
speedily at a just and permanent
peace, permitting return to normal
conditions; from the transfusion of
radical theories from seething Euro
pean centers, pending such delay;
from heartless profiteering, resulting
from the increase of the cost of liv
ing, and, lastly, from the machina
tions of passionate and malevolent
agitators. With the return to normal
conditions this unrest will rapidly
disappear."
o
Where Blame Lies.
Life starts most of us out with an
excellent endowment of strength. It
is our own abuse of this strength tha
brings about our ailments. Life starts
most of us out with courage and will,
ft is our own neglect of these quali
ties that sets courage and will dwind
ling. Life starts most of us with very
good looks or with looks that are good
enough. It is our own neglect of per
sonal care that makes us plain looking.

&. .' - '7'- '
Ellensburg, Wash. "After I was
married 1 was not well for a long time
and a good deal of
the time was not
able to go about.
Our greatest desire
was to have a child
in our home and one
day my husband
came back from
town with a bottle
of Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable
Compound and
wanted me to try it
It brought relief
from my troubles.
I improved in health so I could do my.
housework; we now have a little one, all
of which I owe to Lydia E. Pinkham'a
Vegetable Compound." Mrs. O. S.
Johnson, R. No. 3, Ellensburg, Wash.
There are women everywhere who
long for children in their homes yet are
denied this happiness on account of
some functional disorder which in most
t5ases would readily yield to Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
Such women should not give up hope
until they have given this wondernil
medicine a trial, and for special advice
write Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Co.,
Lynn, Mass. The result of 40 years
experience is at your service.

MUST RENEW AUTO LICENSES
BEFORE JANUARY 1.
7
Maj. J. W. Woodyard, who took
charge of the Motor Vehicle De-.
nartment at Frankfort, Wednesday,
asks THE NEWS to remind the pub
lic that all automobile licenses must
be renewed by the first of January.
After December 31, owners of cars
cannot run them with licenses issu
ed for 1919, and as the new licenses
must be secured in December, Maj.
Woodyard hopes that owners of
cars will not wait until the last day
to get them, for in that event the
department will be unable to handle
the business.
This is a matter of the greatest
importance, and this notice should
be brought to the attention of every
owner of an automobile, so as to
avoid unpleasant consequences.

DEMENTED MAN ARRESTED

in need of medical assistance, was
arrested by Chief of Police Link, in
the L. & N. yards, and taken to the
Paris jail. The man was unable to'
give an account of himself or to
tell his name, but an investigation
developed that he was demented, and
had made his escape from a Colum
bia, South Carolina, insane asylum.
An identification card with his
number established Miis fad. He
will be held here until a C lumbia
officer comes to take him br.ck to

Fall and Winter
SHOULD BE QUARANTINED
Many physicians believe that anv
one who has a bad cold should be !
completely isolated to prevent other
members of the family and associ
ates from contracting the disease,
as colds are about as catching as
measles. One thing cure the soon
er one rids himself of a cold the less
the danger, and you will look a good
while before you find a better medi
cine than Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy to aid you in curing a cold.

Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse Company
(Incorporated)
TOBACCO RECEIVED ANY TIME
3 Big Light Roomy Warehouses-3
COME AND SEE OUR NEW HOUSE
CONSIDER THESE FACTS
1. The Paris market sold 12,000,000 pounds of tobacco the past seas
for the hlfhest average obtained on anyvmarket in Kentucky.
2. The Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse Company sold in their two hovses
more than 8,000,000 pounds of tobacco for die highest average on Paris mar
ket. 3. We now have three of the best and finest lighted houses in Kentucky.
4. Our Auctioneer, Mr. Wikoff, will be back. He is in a class by himself,
as those who have heard him know.
5. We have the best starter in Kentucky.
6. This Company has held down the fees on the Paris market for seven
years and will hold them down again this year in spite of the fact that we were
strongly urged to raise them.
7. This means a saving of 30 cents per hundred on $40 tobacco; a saving
of 35 cents per hundred on $50 tobacco and 40 cents per hundred on $60 to
bacco. Last season the lower fees saved the patrons of Paris market $36,000.
8. We do not try to pinhookour customers, but do our best to give all the
same treatment and the best information at our command at all times. Last sea
son we advised everybody to hold tobacco until January 1st. We now want to
inform you that tobacco is very, very high in North Carolina, and judging our
market by that, as we have been able to do in the past, good bright tobacco will
be very high in Kentucky. The apparent large per cent, of low grade tobacco in
this crop has a tendency to make us apprehensive of lower prices for common
tobacco, though we are glad to note a very considerable advance in low grades
upon hogshead market in the past ten days.
9. It will pay you to put your tobacco over the floor. The speculator
who offers to buy expects to make money and is probably better posted than
you.
10. Take pains in stripping and sorting and let us sell your crop for the
High Dollar. ..
