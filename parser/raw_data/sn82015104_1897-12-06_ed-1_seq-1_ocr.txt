VOLUME XCIV.-NO. 107.
REGULAR SESSION
OPENS AT NOON.
Congress Will Convene at That
Time To-Day.
Leaders and Majority of Members of Both
Houses on the Ground,
lie Extra Session Robbed the
Regular One of Much of Its At
tendant Excitement — Both
Houses Will Await the Presi
dent's Message Before Proceed
ing to Business—The Annexa
tion Treaty Will Probably bo
Taken Up Early.
WASHINGTON, Dec. s.—The regular,
t>r long session of Congress, as It is
called, because there is no constitution
al limitation upon the period of its du
lation, opens at noon to-morrow. The
leaders and a large majority of the
members of both houses are here to
participate in the opening ceremonies
and President McKinley has made the
journey to Washington from the bed-
Bide of his dying mother that his ab
sence might not delay the national Leg
islature at its assembling. The extra
Bession'robs the opening of the reg
ular session of the excitement and in
terest which usually attaches to it. On
the eve of a regular session ordinar
ily, Washington thrills with excitement.
The hotel lobbies surge with place
hunters in the wake of the various can
didates for .Speaker, Clerk, Doorkeeper,
etc., the members are struggling for
committee assignments and the air is
full of rumors and plots and counter
plots. But as the House was com
pletely organized at the extra session
and all the committee assignments
made then, beyond the natural stim
ulus produced by the returning states
men, the regular hangers on of legisla
tion and the outlining of schemes by
members of the "third house," or lob
by. Washington to-night is tranquil.
Th+- programme at the House to
morrow is very simple and beyond the
spectacular show which it offers to the
curious, has, in itself, little attraction.
The House will be called to order by
the Speaker who. after the chaplain's
invocation, will dfrect the Clerk to call
the roll.
This having been accomplished, and
fhe presence of a quorum demonstrat
ed, the Clerk will be directed to notify
-the Senate that the House is ready for
business, and a committee will be ap
pointed to wait on the President. Af
ter that there will be a recess to await
4he arrival of the President's annual
m-wii.-, which will he read upon t*s
rreception and be followed by an ad
journment until Tuesday.
It is the intention of the House lead
"Prs to proceed with the business of the
«?ession as rapidly as possible. The
.committees wffl begin their labors this
wtek, and as alt of them have more or
Jess bills on hand, which were intro
duced at the extra session, there will
l>e no lack of material for the House to
"w >rk on after the committee hoppers
have begun to grind The Appropri
ations Committee has been at work for
ten days and Chairman Cannon ex
pects to pass at least two of the reg
ular budgets before the holidays—the
legislative, executive and judicial and
the pension appropriation bills. One or
the other of these bills, it is expected,
will be reported on Wednesday, and the
end" of the week promises to see the
House down to business. Among the
early general measures to receive con
sideration will be the bankruptcy bill.
Whether it will be the Nelson bill,
■which passe,] the Senate at the last
session, or a modification of the Torrey
bill, depends up. n the temper of the
Judiciary* Committee, which will sub
mit the measure to the House. Be
y nd doubt there will be several reso
lutions of inquiry during the first Week
Which may be more or less sensational,
and some of the radical pro-Cuba lead
ers will attempt to get consideration (or
a Cuban resolution before the Foreign
Affairs Committee can act. Congress
man Livingston, of Georgia, fis one of
these. But owing to the nature of the
House rules all these hasty efforts will
prove a>>ortive and the measures prob
ably will take their course. There will
be nothing except indisposition on the
part of members to prevent the Sen
ators entering upon their work upon
convening of the Senate to-morrow, as
there fc; a calendar already made f >r it
With alxiut 800 bills reported from com
mittees during the special session. If
Bny circumstances should prevent the
receipt of the President's message ->n
"Monday, the probabilities are that the
Senate will adjourn over without tak
ing up any other business until the
message could be received.
With the message read, it will re
main with the Senate to decide as to
whether it shall seriously enter upon
the work of tho session after Monday,
or begin a system of delay Intended to
throw all important questions over be
yond the holidays. The indications are
row f.«r a little more activity than
Usual during the pre-holiday session
This is largely due to the fact that
the supporters' of the Administration

by means of resolution, which would
require only a majority vote, will be
inaugurated. Some members of the
Foreign Relations Committee, who fa
vor annexation, advocate this course,
because they say they see no reason
for traversing the same ground twice,
as they would be compelled to do in
case the matter should be first consid
ered in executive session, fail there,
and then be taken up in the form of
a resolution in open Senate and House.
The immigration bill, for which Sen
ator Lodge stands sponsor, is prac
tically at the. head of the Senate leg
islative calendar, and will be consid-
ered early in the session. Senator Lodge
to-day repeated his intention of press
ing the bill, but he will n< * antagonize
the Hawaiian treaty with The first
bill on the calendar ; s 6 I ■ Gear's
measure, providing for the adjustment
of the Pacific Railroad debt, but the
sale of the Union Pacific doubtless will
have the effect of causing the tem
porary withdrawal of this bill and the
substitution of others. Of the 300 bills
on the calendar about 2m * are private
pension bills, all of which will prob
ably be disposed of at one sitting when
taken up. There are also several hun
dred recess appointments to be con
sidered in executive session.
It is not probable that much will be
done in the way of legislation the pres
ent week. There will be an adjourn
ment on the day after receiving the
message on Monday, and as there is no
disposition to press the Hawaiian mat
ter until the Foreign Relations Com
mittee agrees upon a Hne of action, the
indications now are that it will not
be taken up in the Senate before next
week.
GULDENSUPPE'S FUNERAL.
It Took Place Quietly Yesterday
Afternoon in New York.
NEW YORK, Dec. 5.— The funeral of
Bath Rubber Guldensuppe, who was
murdered at Woodside, L. L, on June
2">th by Martin Thorn and Augusta
Nack, occurred this afternoon from an
undertaking shop on East Third street,
where the body had lain since it was
removed from the Morgue. All day
Saturday and to-day from 11 o'clock
in the morning until the hour of the
funeral immense crowds of the curi
ous flocked to get a look at the mur
dered man. The dismembered body,
arrayed in a dress suit, lay in an oak
coffin with sliding glass top. The right
arm was crossed over the breast. Where
the head should have been was a va
cant spot, save for a photograph of the
murdered man, which was placed
against the side of the coffin.
Upon the coffin plate was engraved
"Christian W. Guldensuppe, died June
27, 1*97, aged 42 years." The funeral
was arranged by two lodges of which
the murdered man was a member.
Eight members of the New York Crew
of Bath Rubbers, who worked with
Guldnesuppe, contributed a large floral
piece, about two feet high. Two were
sent in by the lodges. There were no
ceremonies whatever. The remains
were buried in the Lutheran Cemetery
at Middiesexvillage, L. I.
STOLE HER OWN CHILDREN.
A Woman Who Had Followed Her
Husband for Two Years.
LAS VEGAS (N. M.), Dec. s.—Some
weeks ago Dr. Rhodes, veterinary sur
geon, came to Las Vegas with two in
teresting children, a boy of 7 and a
girl of 9.
Wednesday evening the train from
Colorado brought a handsome middle
aged woman, who went to a hotel and
registered as Mrs. Allver. Ogden, Utah.
The next morning she left the hotel,
and in the afternoon returned with two
children. She said that she was Mrs.
Rhodes, divorced wife of the veterinary,
and told a sad story of the taking of
the children from her by her husband
in San Francisco, two years ago, and
how, spurred on by a mother's love,
she followed them to Alaska, thence to
Utah, through Colorado, and finally to
Las Vegas, where she located her chil
dren, finding them playing in the street.
She left for San Francisco with them.
The doctor was not aware of the chil
dren's disappearance until after the
train had gone. Telegrams were sent
to Albuquerque for the officers to inter
cept the three, but as no warrants were
issued here the Albuquerque officers
refused to hold the woman, and she
was allowed to proceed to her destina
tion.
AN AGED BRIDEGROOM.
Forced to Separate From His Bride,
He Takes His Own Life.
NEW YORK, Dec. ">.—On Thanksgiv
ing evening Samuel G. Parkhill. 74
years of age, of Brooklyn, married Miss
Kirkland of Brooklyn, who was "><>
years his junior. To-day Parkhill com
mitted suicide at hi 6 home in Brooklyn
by snooting himself through th*- brain.
When the couple were married the fam
ilies of the two objected strongly to
the oniOll on account of the disparity
in their ages. The couple were forced
to separate, and smce that time Park
hill has appeared somewhat depressed.
He lived with his married daughter
and son. and when the family were at
church he shot himself. His relatives
give no reason for the suicide beyond
the statement that Parkhill had seemed
despondent during the past few days.
He was employed on the Kings County
[elevated road. Previous to this he was
a Superintendent of the Brooklyn City
and Newton Railroad, and became pos
sessed of considerable property.

THE PRESENT
NATIONAL BANK ACT.
Annual Report of Comptroller of
Currency Eckels.
Reviews the History of the Present National
Banking Act,
Recommends the Removal of the
Restrictions in It Upon the Is
suance of Notes by the Banks
Against the Bonds Deposited
With the Government and De
precates the Issuing of the
Paper by the Government Alone.
WASHINGTON. Dec. s.—The annual
report of James H. Eckles, Comptroller
of the Currency, for the year ended Oc
tober 31, 1897, opens with a brief re
view of the history of thi- legislation
which constitutes the present national
bank Act. and invites the attention of
Congress to amendments \t> the law
recommended in former reports with
out specifically repealing them. On
the subject of bank note circulation, the
Comptroller says:
"It is noticeable that in all the
changes which have been wrought in
the national currency Act from its in
ception to the present time, the feat
ure subject to criticism, but which was
intended should constitute the princi
pal benefit to be conferred, has re
mained comparatively unchanged—
namely, the note issuing function.
Whatever justification there was in the
first instance for restricting the issu
ing of notes against the bonds of the
Government, deposited with the Treas
urer of the United States to 00 per
cent, of the par value thereof long since
ceased. In the report of every Comp
troller of the Currency during the past
twenty year?, the wisdom of changing
the existing law so that the banks, and
through them the communities in which
located, might have the additional ben
efit of an. added loanable capital has
been suggested. Despite all this the
law still remains without amendment.
"Not only should the bank Act be
amended in this particular, but Con
gress should seriously consider such a
change in the method of bank notes is
sues as will enable the banks of the
country to more adequately meet the
demands of trade and commerce m all
sections of the country. The business
of banking, like every other form of in
vestment, must be made attractive to
capital. If it is placed upon a footing
different from other undertakings, em
barrassed through unnecessary restric
tions and deprived of proper sources of
profit, the result cannot be otherwise
than that Jnvestlble capital will seek
other means of employment and to this
extent deprive the people of the bene
fits of the agency most requisite to
commercial activity. It is considered
by every great commercial Govern
ment, except the United States, to be
the sole province of the banks to issue
paper which circulates as currency. The
belief in a bank note currency as being
better and safer than a Government
paper currency prevailed until ques
tioned in this country, until, under the
apparent evidences of war, the Govern
ment undertook to issue paper currency.
Even under such circumstances, the
promise was always given, however,
that it should be retired at the earliest
practicable moment and the tdmission
freely made that it was never a wise
measure nor a safe form of currency.
"Between the competition of the Gov
ernment issues on the one hand, and
the unnecessary restrictions imposed
by law on the other, together with the
increasing price of bonds required to be
deposited as security, the note issuing
function of the banks had been per
mitted to become merely an incident to
the conduct Of the national banking as
sociations of th<* country. It has been
seriously sugg sted more thin once that
the bank note issues be done away with
and all paper be issued by the Govern
ment Instead. The danger of soctl a
course is not to he over estimated. The
experience of every Government has
been that governmental currency paper
is a source of weakness and danger. In
the United States, where there has been
the nearest approach to success with
the volume of the federal paper com
paratively limited in amount, the
credit of the Government has be,. n
more than once put In Jeopadry through
it and the business Interests of the
country subjected to unnecessary loss
and confusion.
' The argument that the Government,
better than the banks, can provide for
the redemption of paper note issues,
I will stand the test of a careful analyst*.
The Government has DO means for ear-
I ing for its demand liabilities except
through borrowing and through the le
vying of taxes. Upon the other hand,
the banks have assets which can be
promptly converted into cash to meet
their outstanding notes when presented.
Their ability to command gold has al
ways b- < n ' -vend that of the Govern-
I ment. for in each financial exigency
which has confronted tic- Government
the banks have furnished to it the
amounts net ssary to maintain its sol
vency.
•It is impossible to believe that with
a syv.tem of bank note issues, based in
part upon Securities and in part upon
bank Assets, the country cannot be
provided with the sound..safe and elas
tic bank note lame, always commensu
rate with and responsive to the de
mands of trad . The Hank of England,
the Hank of Scotland, and the Bank of
Ireland, have been found to be ample
in their resourcsE to provide the note
issues for trade with the United King
dom. The same is tru »of the Bank of
France The "Deutsche Reichsbank, or
Qerman Imperial Bank, has for more
than twenty-two yean issued bank
note paper against assets, which has
maintained its value and been so con
trolled as to successfully meet commer
cial heed of the Empire."
The Comptrolb r calls attention to the
meth •! of organization of this bank,
and publishes some inter-sting statis
tics in connection therewith.
The total number of national banks
organized since the system was put
hit i operation in 1S»"! is shown to have
been 5,095. On October 31st last there
were inactive operation 3.617. having
an authorized capital of $uV{0,200.29."i.
The total outstanding circulation
of the banks then was $229,199.
--880, of which $2t*2.904.r>."> was secured
by bonds of the United States, and the
balance by lawful money deposited
with the Treasurer of the United
States. The circulation outstanding of
all national banks on October 31st last
was $230,131,005, of which amount
$1,558,800 was secured by bonds held
for the account cf insolvent and liqui
dating banks and $26,205,325 by lawful
money deposited for their amount and
by active banks reducing circulation.
The net decrease in the amount of cir
culation secured by bonds during the
year was $12,584,334, and the gross de
crease in the total circulation was
$4,851,292.
The 2.MOT banks in operation are di
vided .geographically as follows: 588,
With an authorized capital stock cf
$159,291,620, in the New England
States; 956, with an aggregate capital
of $195,124,275, in the Eastern States;
54tj. with a capital stock pf $66,761,900,
in the Southern States: 1,046, with a
capital stock of $160,360,961, in the
Middle Stats: 357, with a capital stock
of $32,654,160, in the Western States,
and 124, with a capital stock of $17,
--465,000, in the Pacific States.
During the year forty-four banks
Were organized, with an aggregate
capital stock of $6,420,000; during the
year seventy-one banks went into vol
untary liquidation.
There was paid to creditors of insol
vent banks during the year $13,169,781
in dividends. The magnitude of this
unequalled record. the report says,
will be more forcibly illustrated if con
sidered in the light of what has been
accomplished heretofore, in the way
of dividend payments to the creditors of
insolvent institutions. In 1893 there
was paid in dividends $3,433,646; in
1894* $5.124,577 iin 1895, $3,380,552; in
1896, $2,451,955, and in 1897, $13,169,
--781, making a total of dividends paid
within the five years of $27,560,515, or
364 per cent, of all dividends that have
ever been paid to creditors of insolvent
national banks. From 1863 to 1897
there has been paid in dividends $75,
--935,925, and in the year embraced in
this report $13,169,781, or 171-3 per
cent, of all the dividends that have
been paid during the period of thirty
four years of the existence of the sys
tem. Since October 31st, the end of
the report year, seventeen additional
dividends have been ordered, amount
ing to about §U2r>.(Joo.
The report contains the latest oomi j
piled statistics relative to the world's
monetary systems and the stock of
gold, silver and paper currency.
A very interesting feature of this
statement is the per capita amount of
each kind of money in the countries
named. The per capita averages in the
principal countries of the world are:
United States, $23 70: United King
dom. $20 »».*>; France. .«:',4 68;. Germa
ny, $18 45; Austria-Hungary, $9 33,
and Russia, $8 !»•"».
The Comptroller renews his recom
mendation of last year, urging that na
tional hank examiners he paid an an
nual salary instead of fees, as now.

HOVERING BETWEEN
LIFE AND DEATH.
The Spark of Life Still Burning
Dimly,
Fourth Day of Mother McKinley's Illness
Passed.
Her Condition is Still One of
Steadily Wasting Away and
She May Die at Any Time-
Sinking Spells Follow One An
other—The President Arrang
ing to Return From Washing
ton to Canton To-Nigkt.
CANTON, Dec. s.—Mother McKinley
has passed the fourth, day of her ill
ness, ami enters upon tin- fourth night
with the spark of I>:'*> still burning
dimly. There has not been a material
development in her case to-day. Her
condition has continued om- of steadily
wasting away. The family watched by
the bedside all day, prepared for the
end at any moment, and sometimes
feeling that it had come, as the patient
was seized with sinking spells, which
yesterday were mistaken for a second
stroke of paralysis. During these at
tacks she would perceptibly weaken,
almost cease to breathe and show
scarcely a sign of life. For the most
part these spells were limited to half
an hour, and when they were over she
would resume the quiet repose charac
teristic of the entire illness. About the
middle of the afternoon, however, a
more serious sinking spell occurred,
and lasted two hours. Several times
those keeping vigil thought the last
flutter of life's flame had come. The
attack passed away at last, leaving her
almost the same as when it occurred.
There is a possibility that she may
survive the night or even longer, but
those who have been at the bedside
most constantly have the least hope
of such a result. Communication was
established with the White House as
soon as the President arrived there,
and a telegraph wire is constantly open
to Washington to advise the President
of every occurrence in the sickroom.
Besides this, he had several times
taked with his brother, Abner McKin
ley. by telephone. Dr. Phillips, the
attending physician, had a number of
calls during the day. This evening
he said he could report nothing new.
There had been no notable change in
the patient during the day. She had
continued to grow weaker in the same
manner, and at about the same rate
as during the past few days.
He admitted that this condition would
prevail to the end. Asked as to the pros
pects of her surviving the night, he
sand: "Yes, there is a possibility of
her living till morning. Indeed, I am
inclined to think she will. But she
has been taken so long that no one
could make a prediction for the future
with any assurance of certainty. The
case is one in which we must be pre
pared for the end at any moment. There
will be no rally, no more conscious pe
riod, no final struggle."
The patient has taken no nourish
ment since Thursday. l\ cannot be ad
ministered by ordinary methods, and
the case is one in which heroic methods
of administering food are not regarded
justifiable.
GRADUALLY PASSING AWAY.
CANTON (O.), Dec. ♦>.—At this hour
(1:15) there are strong hopes that Mrs.
McKinley will survive the night. She
is much weaker than at any time, but
is resting quietly and gradually pass
ing away. The whole family is about
the bedside, expecting the end.
THE PRESIDENT ANXIOUS.
He Has Made Arrangements to Re
turn to Canton To-Night.
WASHINGTON. Dec. s.—President
McKinley, accompanied by Assistant
Secretary Day, arrived in Washington
at T:4."» o'clock this morning. He was
met by Secretary Alger. Secretary Bliss
and Secretary Porter and driven to the
White House. The President had re
ceived two telegrams en route from
Canton reporting the condition of his
mother, but he was anxious for later
news. In the midst of the forenoon a
message was received from Abner Mc-
Kinley. at Canton, saying- that the
President's mother was resting In about
the same condition as when he left.
She might last through the day, or
even one or two days longer, but was
liable to die at any moment.
Arrangements have been made for the
return trip to Canton to-morrow even
ing. The President, Mrs. McKinley and
a party of half-dozen close friends and
relatives will leave Washington at 7
o'clock on a special car attached to
the regular Pennsylvania train, and
arriving in Canton at 10 o'clock Tues
day morning.
ALMOST A RIOT.
A Theater Owner Dismantles His
House Sold Under Foreclosure.
LINCOLN (Neb.), Dec. ."». — The
Lansing Theater, the leading playhouse
in the city, was this morning before
daylight dismantled of most of its in
side furnishings, almost a riot accom
panying the work, and as a result J. F.
Lansing, half-owner; L. C. Burr and
Roscoe Pound, his attorneys, and a
score of laborers were to-day arrested.
The trouble is the outcome of the sale
of the property under foreclosure a
week ago. Mr. Lansing claimed that
there was a conspiracy to defraud him
out of his holdings. The District At
torney, however, confirmed the sale on
Saturday, and declared the title vested
in the purchaser. William Oliver of
New York.
Between - and 3 o'clock Lansing, his
attorneys and a number of stage hands
gained entrance and began to remove
scenery and chairs. Agents of Oliver
were notified, and in the controversy
which followed there was a personal
collision between attorneys of the rival
claimants. The police quelled the dis
turbance about the time it began to

SETTING A PACE.
Fast Time Made by Trains on tho
Union Pacific Road.
OMAHA, Dec. o.—Celebrating its new
birth, the New Paciflc has taken two
more falls out of Father Time and has
set a pace for fast running that will
likely stand in the West for some time.
Three record breaking spurts in one
week is its record.
Of the first the Associated Press fur
nished full particulars last Tuesday. Ar
that time, a 520-mile run was made at
the rate of tiJ l -. miles an hour, with a
hundred mile dash at the rate of 68.2
miles an hour. Yesterday the fast
mail was again late in Wyoming and
Was danced across the Nebraska plains
at a rate that makes the Tuesday run
look slow. It covered forty-two miles,
from Sydney to Julesburg in thirty
eight minutes: eighty-one miles from
Julesburg to North Platte in seventy
one minutes: sixty miles. North Piatt
to Lexington in sixty minutes; thirty
five miles, Lexington to Kearney, in
thirty-three minutes and a final dash
of forty-two miles from Kearney to
Grand Island m thirty-six minutes, or
seventy miles an hour.
The 261 "lilt s from Sydney to Grand
Island was made in 2MS minutes, an
average of 65.6 miles an hour. Prom
Grand Isiand to Omaha, the tun WAS
ordinary', the lost time having been
made up. To-day the Union Pacific
brought a theatrical company on a
special train from Ju'esburg to Council
Bluffs, 204 miles m 286 minutes. From
this must be deducted five minutes for
changing engines at Grand Island, four
minutes delay by a Missouri Pacific
train on the crossing at Petrel and nec
essary slowing up through Omaha and
a slow run over the Missouri Pacific
bridge. The actual running time of
the train was 275 minutes, an average
of 63.6 miles an hour.
NOT A POOR MAN'S MECCA.
Disappointed Prospectors Return

DENVER, Dec. 5.—A special to the
"Republican*' from Santa Fe. N. ML,
says: For the past sixty days scores of
prospectors from Colorado and the
Northern States have been passing
through New Mexico en route to the
Yaqui River placer fields in Sonora.
Mexico. The rush caused mvi h ex
citement in this Territory, and recent
ly delegations of mining men have
started In there from Albuquerque. Sil
ver City, Santa Fe and other points.
Special Agent H. C. Flipper of the
United States Land Court, who re
turned to-day from Hesmosillo and
vicinity, tells a story that will dis
hearten all the seekers after wealth in
this alleged new El Dorado. He says
hundreds of miners who have spent the
last few weeks along the Yaqui River
are now struggling to get out and re
turn to the United States. The reports
of gold discoveries there have been
greatly exaggerated.
People who rushed in seemed to think
that a scoop and a gunnysack was all
that was necessary to secure a fortune,
but, said Flipper, "while gold has been
known to exist along the Yaqui River
for many years it is by no means a
poor man's Mecca. If it can be saved
at all, it must be done only by the use
of expensive hydraulic operations. Of
the hundreds who have lately gone
down there many have died."
A QUEER CASE.
Consuming Desire for Knowledge
Leads to Crime.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. s.—On September
3, 1896, William Mills Butler. alias
Westertield, was arrested for using the
mails to defraud. He had some letter
heads lithographed, ostensibly for the
Orphans" Home at Rondout, N. V., with
the name of W. S. Bissell, Postmaster-
General under Cleveland, in the cor
ner as President. Butler's name ap
peared as Secretary- He used these
letterheads in ordering books, and his
orders were filled. Finally he was ar
rested and pleaded guilty. While in
jail he repeated the offense.
He always got books by standard au
thors. In extenuation he said he had a
consuming desire for knowledge. His
term for the first offense expired Fri
day. Now United States Judge Adams
admits he is loath to again sentence
Butler, as he feels that Butler is not
a criminal, but simply wants learning
and is too poor to pay for it. He has
taken the case under advisement.

BERLIN, Dec. o.—Right Rev. Mgr.
Joseph Schroeder. late professor of dog
matic theology of the Catholic Univer
sity at Washington, has been appointed
by the Prussian Minister of Education
and Ecclesiastical Affairs to the facul
ty of the Catholic Academy at Muen
ster. capital of Westphalia.
Mgr. Schroeder's resignation of his
professorship at Washington was
placed in the hands of the Board of
Directors of the Catholic University in
the latter part of October, the board
receiving it on the understanding that
he would be permitted to remain at
the university until the end of the
scholastic year, when the resignation
would take effect, unless he should
sooner find another post.
The period of grace was given hirri
in order tha.t he might communicate
with the Prussian Minister of Educa
tion and arrange for a professorship in
some German university.
At the time Mgr. Schroeder said that
he had earnestly wished to resign dur
ing his last vacation, and had been ad
vised by his physicians to do so, but
that he returned to the university be
cause the Holy Father had advised him
to take that course. The Board of Di
rectors, therefore, left the final decis
ion of the matter to the Pope, after an
official expression of its "regret at tha
many charges against Mgf- Schroeder
in this connection."
