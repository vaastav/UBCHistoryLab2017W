FTXL LEASED WTRE REPORT
OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
The State Journal Is mem bo r of the
Associated Press and receives the full d"T
telerraph report of that great news or
ganization for the exclusivs afternoon
publication In Topeka.

Mr. Denton, the secretary of state,
estimates that the cost of the first state
wide primary was 35,000. This is a
good-sized sum but it is an expediture
of public funds for which the people of
the state are certain that they received
adequate returns.
In the new Democratic leader of the
national house of representatives,
Champ Clark of Missouri, the Demo
crats have selected a man who will
fit well Into the shoes of the retiring
leader, Mr. Williams. Champ is a
fighter from the drop of the hat and
when he has anything to say he says
It in a way that is sure of receiving
attention.
If the selection of John Dawson to
be his private secretary by Mr. Stubbs,
the governor-elect, can be taken as a
criterion of the caliber of the other
appointments that the state's new
executive is to make, and also' as a
criterion of the qualities of the next
administration in every . particular.
Mr. Stubbs' reign will certainly develop
Into a hummer.
Mr. Pinchot, the United States fores
ter, says that the federal government
will be delighted to co-operate with the
state of Kansas to secure forestration.
He says that the government win fur
nish the real thing In the way of n.
forester if the state will provide the
salary. That's fair enough. But who
or what is going to supply the forests
for this chap to work with?
It is not very often that Mr. Roose
velt places himself in the position of a
chicken on a fence, part on one side
and part on the other. But this ap

ject of woman suffrage. Personally he
Is not opposed to the proposition but,
and this "but" ought to be spelled with
capital letters, he sees no hope of bet
tering conditions through it. Therefore,
there isn't much to recommend it.
The members of the streets and walks
committee of the city council are cer
tainly of the right sort. They see their
way clear to report favorably on all of
the petitions that have been filed for
new paving during the coming year.
These call for the paving of no less
than fifty-three blocks of street and
four blocks of alleys. Nothing so en
hances the value of city property as
well paved streets.
Except that all of the football ex
perts in the country have not picked
out their ail-American, all-Eastern,
all-Western and all other locality
football teams to their own satisfac
tion, it may be said that the football
season of 1908 is a thing of the past.
But there will be no lull in college
athletics. No, indeed. Their cur
riculum is quite as extensive, if not
more so, than the others which are
Incident to college life. Basketball
and hockey will divide the athlete's
attention until the spring when base
ball, tennis and track athletics will
come in for their innings. Assuredly,
the college athlete has more to attract
his attention than his brethren who go
In to make a record in their studies.
A couple of newspaper men have been
honored, at last, with elevation to
membership in; the National Ananias
club. Mr. Smith, editor of the Indian
apolis News, and Mr. Laffan, editor of
the New Tork Sun, are the gentlemen
In question. Mr. Roosevelt declares
that the story given prominence in
these newspapers to the effect that his
fcrother-in-law, Douglas Robinson, and
Mr. Taft's brother, Charles P. Taft,
profited greatly as members of the
"syndicate" from which the United
States bought the Panama canal. Is an
"outrageous lie." Fine. Evidence is
not now lacking that the administra
tion of Mr. Roosevelt will go out with a
blaze of pyrotechnics of one sort and
another.
Congress is in session once again. It
has convened for what is familiarly
known as the "short session." Like a
few of its longer predecessors it is not
expected to do much. Outside of the
passage of appropriation bills it is not
believed that much legislation of any
Bort will be enacted. Hence, what was
the necessity of a thirty thousand word
message from the president. None, ex
cept that it was customary and fitting.
If congress should attempt to dispose
of legislation covering the topics sug
gested by the president, and did it wiLb.
its usual speed, or lack of it, it would
probably have to remain in session con
tinuously for eighteen or twenty
months.
"Hazing is a violation of good man
ners and of the right of individual lib
erty. It is a provocation of public dis
order. In Its milder forma It Is a non-
sensical and almost idiotic form of
amusement, unworthy of the support
or favor of any sensible university
student. In its coarser forms, hazing is
a vulgar, brutal, always demoralizing
and eometimes dangerous form of
sport, which a university cannot coun
tenanca and tolerate." These are pert!
nent points from an address delivered
by President James of the University
of Illinois to the students of that insti
tution. They characterize hazing ex
actly and any student of the University
of Illinois, who is found to be guilty of
this misdemeanor, is dismissed from
the rolls of the institution. Similar
conditions ought to prevail in every col
lege and university in the country.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Almost without exception the many
messages which have been sent to con
gress by Theodore Roosevelt, during
the seven years of his Incumbency in the
presidential office, have been unusual in
a variety of particulars. Many of them
have been really remarkable because of
their radical recommendations for leg
islation, that is remarkable in this re
spect because of their having come
from a Republican president. But none
of them have been quite so unusual and
remarkable in one regard as is this last
regular one which was read today in
both branches of the national legisla
ture. It becomes such because of the
fact that there Is not a word in it on
the subject of tariff revision, which is
really the burning public question be
fore the people of the United States
today and which will far overshadow
all other public questions of moment
until it is disposed of in some way by
congress a few months hence. To be
sure, it is probable that the real work
of tariff revision will not be under
taken by congress while Mr. Roosevelt
is in the presidential chair. The same
may be said o many other public ques
tions, because nothing much in the
way of new legislation except in the
matter of appropriations is ever trans
acted at a short session of congress
such as will be the one just convened.
But President Roosevelt does not hesi
tate to discuss in his message many of
these questions and in airing his views
on several of them at great length he
repeatedly calls attention to the proba
ble fact that no action will be taken
on them during the time that he is in
office. So under these circumstances
it is really remarkable that he has not Bick the next day with a virulent
a word to say on tariff revision. attack of smallpox.
It will be recalled that not long ago! Salina can make a good claim to be
Mr. Roosevelt avoided being brought ing one of the real "nutty" regions in
int a H! !rtn nT a torlff Ti-hlla h
was holding a conference or an inter
view at Washington with some gentle
men who were anxious to get his views
on certain tariff matters. On that oc
casion he remarked that "every man
must skin his own skunks, and the tar
iff is Taft's skunk." It was generally
believed at the time that Mr. Roose
velt was in one of his playful moods
when he uttered these words and that
they were in a jocular vein. Certainly
it was the general belief that Mr.
Roosevelt would make known some of
his views on tariff revision in his mes
sage to congress. For the past seven
years it has been very apparent that
he has a high opinion of his own views
on all things and this makes it all the
more remarkable that he has failed to
express them on tariff' revision at a
time when that question looms up with
such importance on the public horizon.
As to the things that President Roose
velt does discuss in his message it may
be said that they cover every other
possible question that in any way af
fects the government of the country
and its possession and the welfare of
the people of all classes. He adheres
to his well known policies' regarding
the control of railroads and corpora
tions doing an interstate business by
the federal authorities and expresses
his opinions on these important affairs
in the same general line that he has
pursued in several other messages to
congress. And one of his greatest ser
vices to the people of the country has
been performed through the repeated
expressions of these views. By arous
ing public opinion to the grave political
dangers arising from monopolistic and
corporation abuses Mr. Roosevelt has
done his country and his countrymen
an inestimable service, the value of
which will be infinitely more apprecia
ted in the future than at the present
time.
A considerable portion of the message
is devoted to a discussion of labor con
ditions and the necessity for their bet
terment in many ways. Mr. Roosevelt
emphasizes the point that the solution
of the labor problem depends as much
upon the proper action of the states in
the premises as upon the action of the
nation. He insists that the views held
by extreme labor leaders for a reform
of the courts in several particulars are
unconstitutional because they would
take on the form of class legislation.
Mr. Roosevelt argues with his usual
strength for the protection of the for
ests as a duty to succeeding genera
tions. He favors the immediate im
provement of the navigable rivers on
an adequate and comprehensive scale.
He points out that the public health
should be guarded further from the
dangers from food adulterations. He
renews his demands for an income tax,
for the establishment of postal savings
banks and for a parcel post on rural
routes.
Matters pertaining to the army and
navy are discussed at length. Ir.
Roosevelt would have the system of
promotions in the army revised so that
officers would not have to be advanced
according to seniority and declares that
there is great need for a scheme by
which "respectable elderly incompet
ents" in the army can be refused pro
motions. He would have the administra
tion of the navy reorganized by the
abolition of the present bureau system
and the placing of the navy on the
same sort of a military footing that
now maintains in the army.
On the country's colonial affairs the
president has a good deal to say. He
declares that the Philippines are mak
ing great progress but says that its
citizens are not yet fitted for self-government.
He asks that American citi
zenship be conferred on the citizens of
Porto Rico. And he warns Cubans that
the only way a people can avoid being1
governed from without is for them to
show that they can and will govern them
selves from within. He points out that
cordial relations with the countries of
South America are much to be desired
and suggests that ample appropriations
be made for the proper representation
of the United States at the World's
fair to be held In a few years under
the auspices of Japan.
Taken as a whole Mr. Roosevelt's last
regular message to congress is an ad
mirable public document, one that can
be read with profit by every person in
the land who is at all interested in its
government, as all of them should be.
The chances are that it will not be
Mr. Roosevelt's "swan song" as he is
prone to special messages whenever any
sort of an occasion presents itself.

The Emporia Gazette's poultry edi

obviously an attempt to obtain money

eggs are worth anything. At other
times the fool critters are so busy
laying that they won't take time to
eat. There are seasons when this ae

KANSAS COMMENT
" " i
GOVERNOR STUBBS'S DREAM.
Governor-Elect Stubbs, it is said,
has a dream of placing all the in
stitutions of the state, educational,
penal, correctional and charitable un
der the state board of control. This
will strike those acquainted with" the
management of institutional work in
Kansas as carrying unification en
tirely too far. There is something in
the administration of institutions even
more important than the manage
ment of the . finances. Questions will
enter into the policy of the state
university for instance, which would
be entirely different from problems
arising out of the management of the
penitentiary.
The course of effort required in the
management of the insane hospitals
would be entirely different from that
required in the management of the
school for the agriculture. It would
be as logical to mix the business of
running a packing house and a silk
mill as it would to mix the business
of running a school for the feeble
minded with the business of running
a state normal. The very incongruity
of all institutions of the state has ren
dered it a dangerous experiment to
place all these institutions, with their
highly varied purposes, under one
board, because a board adapted to
the management of the university
might not be adapted to the man
agement of a penitentiary. It would
be a better system for Mr. Stubbs to
combine the penitentiary board and
the board of the Hutchinson re
formatory, because both of these
boards now manage a purely penal
work. The board of control as now
organized has ample work to do If it
properly manages the nine great in
stitutions in the state's system of
charities and correction. The three
boards of regents, which now manage
the State university, Manhattan, col
lege and Emporia normal, could also
be combined Into one board because
the work presided over by this com
bined board would be similar, and
under one board the educational sys
tem of the state would be unified.
Mr. Stubbs has taken his idea of
one great business department to
manage all state institutions of every
kind from the business requirements
of a railroad contracting outfit. Run
ning state Institutions is not like run
ning various grading outfits. A man
doing railroad . contracting over a
wide scope- of country might have a
hundred outfits at various points and
he would need a central office to man
age them all because it is all one line
of business, but runnine universities
and penitentiaries and schools for the
blind and insane, hospitals and in
dustrial schools and hospitals for
epileptics is not one class of business.
It represents a varied class of policies,
and the problems involved In the man
agement call for men of varied in
tellects and special trainings. Wich

NO "CURE ALL."
In the Ottawa Republic Tom Morean
says he is inclined to favor the com
mission form of government, a proposi
tion which the people of that town wi.l
vote upon shortly, but that "There is no
cure-air in government, either munici
pal, state or federal." That puts the
case exactly. It is not so much the
form of government from which we de
rive benefits, as it Is- through the ex
ercise of civic duty and Judgment by
the people who are behind that govern
ment and who are responsible for it.
Because of the centralization of au

obligation Ufwaifd, constituencies, be
tween a mayor-arid-council form of
government and a commission the lat

that commission under certain circum
stances might not be so desirable as
councils and mayors.
The ideal city government will be ap
proached exactly in the measure that
the voters accept in the measure that
the voters accept a personal responsi

greatest elation over the strange re

come to him a vision or tnat wnicn

Nowadays, electricity is constantly
assuming more and more of the
world's work. There are few things
that it does not do, fewer by far than
it cannot do if given the opportunity.
The application of the force to prac

Color Cure for Insane.
At Bartonville, lit, two cottage build
ings have been erected in connection
with the Illinois hospital for the insane
in which the effects of colors on pat
ients are to be given a thorough test.
j.ne iwo cottages cost $100,000 and are
equipped with eight solariums, and the
work will be inaugurated and the build
ings dedicated Thanksgiving day. Dr.
Zeller, who is in charge of the experi
ment, was the first to throw away locks
and bars in an Insane asylum and trust
to more modern and humane methods
of dealing with mental afflictions.
According to Dr. Zeller there are four
colors that are especially curative and
soothing in their effects on certain pa
tients. . These are ruby, violet, amber,
and opal. In the cottages at Barton
ville there 'are two rooms, or solariums,
devoted to each of these colors. The
incandescent lamps, the glass through
which the light enters, as well as the
decorations, are all similar in each of
the two rooms devoted to a certain col
or, and patients will be treated in each
as their cases may demand. Dr. Zel
ler finds that the despondent become
cheerful in a red solarium, the violent
ones are soothed under the influence
of the blue rooms, while opal and am
ber are found to aid consumptives and
certain others.
The idea of phototherapic treatment
for its influence oh mind and body is
not new. Every one knows that green,
the green of grass and fields and for
ests, is pleasing and calming to the
eye and mind; that the opaline tints
of water as seen on lakes or ocean are
restful, and that red is stimulative in
its effects upon the passions. The idea
of solariums and the use of different
colored glass in the treatment of dis
ease has also been applied in Denmark
for perhaps 20 years or more. The first
American experiment on a large scale
in the treatment of the insane by pho
totherapy will therefore be watched
with interest. New York World.
Tried It on the Dog.
Doc, a fox terrier, who makes his
home in the Harlem hospital and runs
with the ambulance whenever it is
called out, proved his loyalty to that
institution by permitting his stomach
to be utilized in the aid of science.
If he had known the name of the
instrument used he might have ob
jected, but as he didn't, he probably
will win renown in surgical annals one
of these days. It was an oseophogo-
scope that's all.
Dr. George M. Bennett and Dr.
George Rerrity, attached to the sur
gical staff of the hospital, and Dr.
Perry Shoonmaker, of 161 West 126th
street, a visiting surgeon, have been
trying to perfect the what-d'ye-call-it
for a long time. It is a long silver
tube, from one-quarter to one-half an
inch in diameter and hollow. On the
inside are mirrors and at one end is a
reflector, the whole being operated by
an electric battery. The purpose was
to insert this tube in the mouth of a
patient and down the throat to the
stomach, the mirrors and reflectors giv
ing such a view of the interior that
diagnosis would be made easy.
As nobody volunteered to try the
merits of the new device the surgeons
were becoming discouraged, when Doc
opportunely fell ill. The three physi
cians were quite sure he had stomach
trouble and Doc didn't say anything to
the contrary. So they took him un
awares yesterday, put him under ether.
and put the oseophogoscope into him.
The examination lasted 40 minutes,
and, sure enough, it was stomach trou
ble. The surgeons said the experiment
was a great success and the utility
of the same word as before assured.
What the dog thought about it was
not learned. New York Herald.
Foresting Abandoned Farms.
The abandoned farms of New Eng
land have been taken advantage of
to a considerable extent for forestry
work. During the past year about
2,500 acres have been planted with
trees, and in the course of a few years
these will prove profitable investments.
In addition to this, several of the
water companies have adopted the
tree planting policy as a means of
fostering the water supply. The re
demption of these farms is a very im
portant thing to this section, for the
increasing number of abandoned farms
has been a matter of serious alarm for
a long time, and this step seems to
offer a solution to the problem of
utilizing the land which has been lying
idle. In Massachusetts this area of
waste has been computed as 10 per
cent of the total acreage, while in
Rhode Island alone there are no less
than 228 of these abandoned farms.

THE EVENING STORY
Broadening Jethro.
(By Carl Williams.)
The town could boast no "Seeing
Concordia Car," but had one of the
ubiquitous omnibuses carried visitors
through the pleasant, shaded streets,
it is certain that Jethro Hawkins
would have been pointed out as one
of the objects of local interest along
with the bank; the pulp mill and the
house where Washington had slept
when passing through the town.
In the absence of sightseers Haw
kins was an object of unfeigned inter
est to his fellow townspeople more
especially the women, for a confirmed
bachelor is ever the cynosure of
matchmakers.
Other cavaliers came and wooed
and won or were dismissed to woo
again, but Jethro's infatuation for An
dadra Wayland could be counted upon
as a topic of conversation year in and
year out.
When Jethro had been a great
gawky lad of nineteen and Andadra
a sentimental slip of seventeen-year-old
femininity, he had kissed her and
had asked her to wait for him. After
ward he never could tell how he had
achieved either the Hiss or the ques
tion. 0
Jethro was now thirty and Anada
dra twenty-eight, and they were still
waiting, because Jethro was thrown
into a panic at the very sight of a
woman. '
Andadra was patient and said "No"
to half a score of suitors, but still
Jethro did noU speak, so the whole,
town, knowing the situation, came to
take an Interest in the affair.
That Jethro was in love was above
question. Love shone in his eager blue
eyes. Despairing adoration was be
trayed in every line of the dejected
figure.
If tongue could have spoken his
love as eloquently as his eyes, Con
cordia's matchmakers would have
ceased to worry.
Then suddenly jethro went away.
Connected with his departure was no
incident, but his return was eventful.
To be sure he planned to spend a
week-end with his grandmother, but
to Concordians a journey of two hun
dred miles was something more than
an event, and practically the whole
town saw Jethro off.
It gave him a rather good opinion
of himself and he bore himself with
dignity on the journey. He assumed
the airs of a traveler of long exper
ience, and when the time came for his
return he approached the railroad
station with none of the embarrass
ment he had felt when he went to
take the train at Concordia.
He even lingered on the platform
until the last moment instead of
climbing aboard the train the mo
ment it pulled Into the station.- With
a blase air he let one or two cars slip
past him and he swung himself
aboard by the rail of the rear plat
form. He threw open the door and passed
through the corridor of the sleeper. In
the washroom half a dozen men were
playing cards with a suit case for a
table. Most of them were coatless,
and their collars and ties had been
removed in the heat of the game.
Jethro hurried on. He did not want
a seat in the sleeper; it cost more
money.
He knew that the dav coaches were
just ahead,- and vaguely . wondered
why one sleeper should be in the rear
when all the others were ud front
ahead of the ordinary coaches. When
ne issued from the corridor he stood
rooted to the floor in amazement.
Instead of the decorous, well-
groomed city travelers he had ex
pected to find, some twenty flashily
dressed women were scattered
through the car.
As he appeared one tiny little
woman, with hair obviously bleached.
set up a cry of "Look who's here!"
and the other nineteen obeyed the
command. Now, even a ' city man
may well quail before twenty
actresses. What chance had Jethro
against their raillery?
He was good lookinsr. with an
athletic figure, but his clothes and his
manner bespoke the man of the small
town. His confusion was immensely
diverting to the women members of
the burlesque company, who were
only too appreciative of a break in the
monotony of travel.
In a moment they had flocked about
mm ana were plying him with ques
tions. Stammeringly he explained that
he was merely making his way toward
the forward part of the train. They
vvuuiu not accept tne explanation.
Now, honest, Reuben, you came to
visit us!" cried the little soubrette,
You re a sly old boy, and you can't
get out oi it tnat 'way. Sit down and
ten us your name and all about your
self. Your name is Reuben, isn't it?"
"It's Jethro," he explained, vaguely
conscious tnat - Mteuoen' held some hid
den meaning not altogether free from
sarcasm. "It's Jethro Hawkins, and
dldn t come to see you. I got on the
tail end of the train and I want to go
to one of the reg'lar cars. I don't know
what this car is, but I guess it's a
lunatic asylum.
A roar of laughter greeted the com
ment and the soubrette patted the
bronzed cheek appreciatively.
"You're all right, Jethro," she cried
laughingly. "This isn't the foolish
foundry on wheels, though it will be if
we have to have many more o these
long jumps. This is the Gotham Gaiety
Girls company, and we're awfully
pleased to meet you. This car won't be
cut off for three hours yet, and we can
have a nice long visit.
"I don't want no visit," declared
Jethro, but his wishes counted for
naught. The company was train-tired
and welcomed the diversion of his un
expected call.
They enjoyed Jethro's embarrassment,
which amounted almost to terror, and
when he sought to push his way for
ward they clung to his neck, and he
was forced to sit down, if only to es
cape the white arms that detained him.
Almost before he realized it he was
chatting with the crowd as though he
had known them for years. The men
had come into the car from the card
game and took a part in the fun, and
when, at last, they began to get ready
for their Journey's end, he really re
gretted their going.
When their special car was cut off he
waved them a farewell from the rear of
the last day coach and then went for
ward to the smoker for the remainder
of the trip.
It was late in the afternoon when
the train halted at Concordia and Jeth
ro descended the steps. Andadra was
not on the station platform, but as
Jethro was driven home in the village
'bus he passed the girl on her 'way to
the poetoffice.
"Leave my grip with the folks, Jim,"
he cried as he dropped from the step
of the vehicle, and to the astonish
ment of the onlookers, raced after
Andadra. But none of them was more
astonished than the girl, for Jethro
came up with a Jauntiness that in him
was astonishing.
"I wanted to tell you - that --I'm
coming over tonight to see you," he
explained. "I've something I want to
tell you," he added importantly.
"Anything you can't tell me now?"
asked the girl wonderingly.
"Oh, I don't know," was the assured
response. "I Just want to ask you to
marry me and I meant to do it right
In your own sitting room. But I guess
there's no time like the present. Will
you have me?"
"I thought you were never going to
speak," said Andadra beaming her
delight. "I thought you didn't care
for me any more, Jeth."
"Been caring 'bout eleven years,"
told Jethro, "but I always seemed
afraid to speak. I guess travel must
broaden a fellow."
Andadra nodded her happy assent,
but Jethro wisely forebore to tell her
that the guying and the frank friend
liness of the Gotham Gaiety Girls had
cured his fear of her sex. He felt
somehow that Andadra would not un
derstand. (Copyrighted 1908 by As
