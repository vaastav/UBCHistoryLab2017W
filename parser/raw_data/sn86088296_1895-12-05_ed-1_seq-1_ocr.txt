was modest and full of good feeling, bir
non-committal as to policies.
I However, it was not expected that th.
speaker would touch the questions to hi
ui-iui in uy mo nouse.
Ex-Speaker Crisp assumed the leader
ship of the minority, ami it was signiti
cunt that Mr. Payne of New York m:uh
the motion which usually devolves upoi
the leader of the majority. This is takci.
to mean that ho is to be the chairman o'
the .ways and means committee and tin
recognized, leader of the Republicans or
the tioor. An arrangement was entered
into by which the Republicans shouli'
have the first tiers of the seats on the
Democratic side alid also the last two
tiers. Three hundred and fifty-six num
bers were placed in a box and shaken np.
A blindfolded page drev out the ballots
and the members selected their seats bp
their names were drawn., According to
the usual custom, the house granted the
ex-speakers. Mr. Crisp of Georgia, and
Mr. Gro,w of Pennsylvania, the privilege
of selecting their seats without drawing.
Mr. Crisp selected a seat in the heart of
the Democratic minority and Mr. Grow
took a seat near the center of the Repub
lican side. j.
The name of McClure (Rep.), Ohio,
was the first drawn from the box.
Messrs. Owens (Dem), Kentucky, the suc
cessor of Mr. Breckinridge, was the sec
ond and Mr.Parkins (Rep.), Iowa, was the
third. Popular members were applaud
ed as they came forward and selected
their places, and the page boys scooted
from desk to desk, conveying lloral
pieces sent by admiring friends. Before
thodrawing was half completed the array
of desks was transformed into n bower
Sf roses. Among those , who were thus
remembered were ex-Speaker Crisp and
Mr. Bnrtlctt (Dem.) of New York, who
drew the "booby prize."
His was the last name called. As soon
as the drawing was completed the house,
on motion of Mr. Payne of New York,
adjourned until tomorrow.
Highest award at World's Fair went to
Dr. Price's Baking Powder.

THE HOUSE.
Washington, Dec. 2. The Fifty-fourth
house of representatives was called to
order today.
At 15 minutes of 12 the floor was clear
ed and those who had not the privilege
of the floor reluctantly retired and sought
at the thronged doors of the gnlleries
an opportunity to get a glimpse of the
proceedings below. . As the hands of the
clock opposite the speaker's desk pointed
to 12, Colonel '-Ike" Hill, the deputy
sergeaut-at-arms, lifted into its place on
the green pedestal alongside the rostrum
the ebony eagle-surmounted mace, the
emblem of the house authority; the llag
above the house was run up and Clerk
Kerr called the Fifty-fourth house of
representatives to order.
A hush immediately fell upon the as
sembly, and Rev. Bagley of this city,
the chaplain of the house, offered the
invocation.
Under the direction of Mr. Kerr the
roll of members elected to the Fifty
fourth house was called.
Mr. Kerr announced that 311 of the 3."i0
members of the house were present, and
also that no credentials had been received
from the Tenth New York and the First
Nevada districts. Mr. Kerr then called
the nominations for speaker.
No nominating speeches were made.
Mr. Grosvenor (Rep.), Ohio, chairmou
of the Republican caucus, placed in nom
ination Thomas B. Reed of Maine; Mr.
layers (Dem.), Texas, the name of Cbas.
F. Crisp of Georgia, and Mr. Kem (Pop.),
Nebraska. J. C Bell of Colorado.
The names of both Mr. Reed and Mr.
Crisp were vigorously applauded by their
party associates.
Messrs. Hopkins (Rep.), Illinois, Loud
(Rep.), California. Erdniann (Dem.), l'enn
sylvania, and Cntchings (Dem.), Missis
sippi, were appointed tellers and the roll
was called, the constitution requiring the
elect ion of speakers by viva voce vote.
All the Republicans voted for Mr.
Reed; with one exception all the Demo
crats for Mr. Crisp and all the Populists
for Mr. Bell. The exception was Mr.
('rain, a Democrat from Texas, who.
when his name was called, voted for his
colleague Mr. Culberson of Texas.
The result of the vote was: Reed,
234; Crisp, 05; Bell, C; Culberson. 1.
Mr. Kerr's announcement of Mr. Reed's
election 'was greeted with a thunder of
applause.
Messrs. Crisp, Grosvenor and Bell
were appointed a committee to conduct
the speaker to the chair, and soon ap
peared at the main entrance, Mr. Reed
leaning on the arm of ex-Speaker Crisp
and Messrs. Grosvenor and Bell arm in
arm. As they moved down the center
aisle the house rose en masse. A roar
of applause followed, the gallery follow
ing with great enthsiasm in the demon
stration. As Mr. Reed ascended the
rostrum the roar swelled until it was
deafening. Above this volume of sound
came like pistol shots cries of "lieed,
Reed. Reed!" ,
The Republicans cheered, many of thorn
wildlv, and the ladies in the galleries
waved handkerchiefs. For over a min
ute the demonstration continued.

THE SENATE.
Washington, Dec. 2. Nothing hap
IH'iied in the senate today that had not
been anticipated. The body was called
to order by Vice President Stevenson.
The new senators and those who had
been re-elected were sworn in. A rnm.
mittee was appointed to notify the pres
ident and usual resolutions incident to
the beginning of the session were iutro-
uucoa. ine senate took a recess of an
hour at 12:28 p. m., and at 1:30, ad
journed after an absolutely uneventful
session. The new senators and those re

AVashington, Dec. 2. The ! United

today by Vice President Stevenson. All
of the galle17.es, public nnd private,' ex
cept that reserved for the diplomatic
iipn, were nneu to overflowing.
The lloral off ennirs worn unnuunllvf

exactly at 12 o'clock the vice presi

A SlIOItT CAUCUS.
Washington, Dec. 2. The Republican
senators were not in caucus for half an
hour afer the senate adjourned today,
but adjourned until Wednesday without
Inking any action on the reorganization
of the senate.
Mr. Sherman was elected chairman of
the caucus and Mr. Dubois secretary.
The discussion was informal and centered
around the question whether the Repub
lican senators, having a plurality between
a majority of the senate, should attempt
reorganization with Republican ollicers
mid Republican chairmen of committees.
It was evident that the prevailing senti
ment favored Republican organization,
and some strong speeches were made,
notably by Messrs. Davis of Minnesota
nnd Aldrich of Rhode Island, urging
that there should be no combination or
promise with any element outside the
Republican ranks. This appeared to
voice the general view of seuutors, and
no opposition speeches were made.
The question arose, however, as to
whether the test of strength should be
made on securing the committees or
choice of a president pro tern. In order
to prevent this issue Mr.' Hoar moved
the appointment of a committee on com
mittees, to have charge of a move to se
cure reorganization on Republican lines.
Mr. Hale offered ah amendment for a
test on the choice of president pro torn.
In the formal discussion following Mr.
Fryc's name was mentioned as the prob
able candidate for president pro tern.
Some senators raised the point, however,
that the president pro tern could not be
elected while the presidng ollicer was
present, nnd acting under the same rules
it was finally decided that no vote should
lie taken at present, and Messrs. Hoar
nnd Hale withdrew their motions.
The understanding was that a definite
line of action would be agreed on at the
meeting Wednesday following the ses
sion of that day. The main reason for
the withdrawal of the motion to appoint
the committee by the chairman was the
discovery of the fact that there was a
large element in the caucus opposed to
the selection of the committee by appoint
ment. MONTHLY DEBT STATEMENT.
Washington, Dec. 2. The monthly
treasury statement of the public debt
shows that on November 30, 1805, the
debt, less cash in the treasury, amounted
to $048.477 .U1, an increase for the month
of lf2.OKi.503, which is accounted for by
the decrease of $2,541,011 in the cash in
the treasury. The debt is recapitulated
11s follows: '
Interest bearing debt, $747,301,900;
debt on which interest has ceased since
maturity, $1,070,180; debt benriug no in
terest. .37(!.845,857. Total debt. $1,125,
83.007. This amount, however, does
not include $582,087,073 in certificates
and treasury notes, which are offset by
an equal amount of cash in the treasury.
The cash in the treasury is classified as
follows:
Gold. $120,907,445; silver, $502,104,742;
paper. $1"3.8t2.744: bonds. dibiirsement

I IOW TI I E M ESSAGE TOO K.
Washington. Dec. .!. Both cilriiiHit v
and interest were manifested by the
members of the bouse in the president's
message. Members express surprise
that no recommendation wns made for
the supply of the treasury deficit. In the
discussion of foreign affairs the portion
devoted to the enforcement of the Mon
roe doctrine, in connection with the
boundary line dispute, and the sugges
tions regarding Cuba attracted special
ttention, but the main interest centered
in the recommendations for the retire
ment of the greenbacks and the exten
sion of the National banking system.
Several of the Democratic leaders who
differ with the president on the financial
question refused to express their opin
ions lor puhlicntion.
the Kcpufilicuiis of the senate do not
approve the president's message so far
as it concerns finances. It matters not
whether they be silver men or not, they
all have something to say against it.
Many senators expressed the opinion
that the message was disappointing, be
cause it did not provide a method for
raising revenue.
All of the Republicans who are known
as sound money men were especially dis
appointed on account of this feature of
the message, ihe silver men, of course,
were very emphatic in their disapproval
of the president's views on silver. For
the most part, however, the Republicans
spoke in terms of approval of the posi
tion of the president regarding foreign
nffnirs, but more especially as to what
be said about enezueln. Ihe silver
Democrats had very little to say regard
ing the message and it was for the most
part a disappoinment for them. There
was a general impression in tne senate
that the proposition of the president to
retire the greenbacks would not lie suc
cessful.
LONDON COMMENTS.
London. Dec. 3. Newspapers will very
generally contain editorial cements upon
President I lovelanu s inessuge to con
gress.
The Graphic says:
"The crudities and indiscretion of Presi
dent Cleveland's present proniicinmento
on foreign affairs might have been evolved
bv the late Mr. Blaine in his worst mood.
Can anything be more absurd than the
proposal that the Hchomberg line (in
Veneznehi). should be submitted to ar
bitration? "The reference to Cuba is infinitely
more judicious. It is virtually an ex
pression of sympathy with filibustering."
The Times' editorial says:
"President Cleveland has drawn a
startling picture of the difficulties created
bv the vicious currency system and wc
shall be greatly surprised if the plans he
suggests are not warmly welcomed by
business men throughout the States.
But, flushed by election victories, it is
probable enough that the Republicans will
refuse to allow nnything to be done in
the direction indicated. Meanwhile the
remainder of the message, especially
with reference to foreign relations, will
give the impression hat he is marking
time. Nothing, he says, commits him to
a new aggressive foreign policy, whilst
it will task the igneuity of his oppon
ents to make out that he has in any way
compromised the dignity or been careless
of the interests of his own country."
The Daily News, the liberal organ, will
say:
"President Cleveland knows better
thnn to treat the Monroe doctrine as if jt
were a rule of International law. It is
neither dignified nor politic for the ad
niuistration at Washington to take up
the quarrels of South America communi
ties which do not observe the usages of
civilised nations. ,
"America will find some day that this
sort of patronage iuvolves a correspond
ing responsibility nnd they will not like
that at all."
The Standard, the Conservative or
gan, says:
"We cannot but regret the tone of
President Cleveland's reference to Vene
zuela. If we may judge from the tone
and substance of Mr. Olney's dispatch,
from the paraphrase thus imparted to
congn-ss, we are not surprised that no
answer uns neon received, and we fur
ther undertake to predict that when the
report reaches the White house it will
furnish the president with a deal of mat
ter for serious reflection. We must be
pardoned if we venture to sny that the
noie passage reiomng to enezueln is
a tissue of unreal assumptions nnd un
supported deductions. If the Americans
desire to curry out the views thus ex-
iresseu xney win do m after the calcu
lation of the cost. K von if wo wivrw
eager for arbitration, the experience of
the Behring sea controversy would
hardly encouraue us. It is not onmr i
argue calmly when we find' that Presi
dent Cleveland lias already prejudiced
the merits of the dispute. But even
strong States have rights, and though
Great Britnin is able to maintain its
dignity nnd interests it ought not to b
a mark - for nublie affront i n n lirntik
dentin! message. We are not much im
pressed with bis currency proposals; he
suggests n palliative and not n cure."
The Post,. Conservative, says:
"As regards : Samoa and Venezuela,
the message appears to be framed on
lines which Senator Chandler might ap
prove. In regard to Cuba, thorn nr..
similar signs of a disposition to con
ciliate the feelings of popular agitators.
These thimrs are incidents nf miv nrnui.
dentin! campaign nnd President Cleve
land never pretended to bo superior to
flints '
An editorial in the Chronicle says:
"It is very doubtful if rnmrrnHa will
nccept President Cleveland's currency
plan. The message sounds cautious, but
there is a note in the direction of free
trade.
"Ihe reference to Armenln must hn re
garded as the definite ndherence of the
United States to the European concert.
Few honest critics can say anything
against President Cleveland's reference
to Venezuela. Wo agree with him that
the boundary dispute is eminently suited
to arbitration and undoubtedly our gov
ernment will take the same view. It
must lie remembered that this question
is quite distinct from that of the repara
tion due us by Venezuela for injuries.
When such reparation is made every
liberal in the country will acquiesce in
Venezuela's demands."
The Chronicle concludes its editorial
by asking whether America is ready to
undertake the responsibility thus incur
red for the faithful discharge of their ob
ligations by the American republics.
Gifts to fool the public in adulterated
baking powders. Dr. Price's alone is

INGERSOLL'S CASE HOPELESS.
Minneapolis, Dec. 3. Col. Robert O.
Ingersoll lectured this evening at Ot-

viewed on the 3000 prayers offered for
him on Thanksgiving day. He is not
vinimy disturbed by tne prayers which
the Christian Endeavorers of the Nation
are causing to lie made for bis snlva
tion. When asked if he believed in
the efficacy of these petitions, he said:
"Oh, we will have to wait and see what
will be done. I suppose that God is
busy yet with the people's prayers of
thanksgiving of last week and has not
got around to that yet. We will have
to wait and see what will be done. If
these prayers are effective, then the
Endeavorers ought to go after Grover
Cleveland. His message reads as if he
needed it."

, HARDWARE DEALERS.
THE FRISCO WOULD WITHDRAW.
A Proceeding That May Prevent the Sale
or Muila t e 1 roperlies.
Kansas City, Dec. 3. A special to the
Journal from Topeka says: '
A sensation was caused in the United
States circuit court today by the filing
by the bondholders of the St. Louis and
San Francisco railroad of an interveninir
petition in the big foreclosure suit under
which the Santa Fe properties are to lie
sold on DeeenilM-r 10. The petitioners
recite that the Santa Fo acquired a con
trolling interest in the 'Frisco road
through fraud, and ask for an order of
court setting aside the contract under
which such control wns secured nnd also
for nn order declaring void all bonds
issued against the 'Frisco road under this
contract. They nlso petition that the
consolidated mortgage bonds of the 'Fris
