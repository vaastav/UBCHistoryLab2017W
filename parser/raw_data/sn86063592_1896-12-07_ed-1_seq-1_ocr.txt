A GENERAL SYNOPSIS
Washington, D. C, Deoember 7.
The following is a synopsis of Presi
dent Cleveland's message to tbe f ifty
fourth congress, as furnished by the
Western Union Telegraph Co.
To die Congress of the United State:
As representatives of the people in the
' legislative branch of their government.
you have assembled at time when the
strength and excellence of our free institu
tioni and the fitness of our citizens to en
Joy popular rule bave been again made
manifest. A political contest involving
momentous consequences, fraught witb
feverish apprehension and creating ag
gressiveness so Intense as to approach bit
terness and Dsssion has been waged
throughout our land, and determined by
the decree of free and independent suf
frage without disturbance ot our tr.nquil-
Ity or the least sign of weakness in our na
tlonal structure.
When we consider these locidents and
contemplate tbe peaceful obedience and
manly submission which bave succeeded a
boated clash of political opinions, we dis
cover abundant evidence of a determlna-
i tioo on the Dart of our countrymen to
abide by every verdict of the popular will
- and to be controlled at all times by an
abiding faith in tbe agencies established
for tbe direction of the affairs of their gov
ernment. Thus our people exhibit a pa-
" triotic disposition whicb entitles them to
! demand of those who undertakes to make
and execute their laws such faithful and
onseldsb service in their bebalf,as can only
be prompted by a serious appreciation of
the trust and confidence which tbe ac
ceptance of public duties Invites.
With this analysis of tbe recent election,
President Cleveland begins his annual
message to congress. Tbe document com
prises more than 20,000 words. It contains,
besides a wealth of departmental informa
tion and statistics, a snccinct review of
tbe Cuban revolution without committing
the United States government to an avow
al of hostility, either against tbe s 'ver
eigoty of Spain or tbe Cuban Insurgents.
President Cleveland begins that portion of
bis message devoted to foreign affairs by
referring congress to tbe report ot tbe
aecretary for all details in connection wltb
minor matters. He then declares that tbe
' disturbed condition in Asiatic-Turkey
has assumed a less hideous and bloody as
pect during the past year, owing to tbe de
cisive action on tbe part of tbe great na
tions and tbe consequent awakeoing of
the Turkish government to the demand of
humane civilization. 60 far as tbe United
States government is concerned, it has left
undone nothing for tbe protection of
American missionaries and citizens in tbe
.. Ottoman empire. . Continuing the presi
dent sas;
I do not believe that tbe present sombre
prospect In Turkey will be long permitted
to offend tbe sight of Cnristiandom. It so
roars the humane and enlightened civiliza
tion that belongs to the cloe of the nine
teenth century, that It seems hardly possi
ble that tbe earnest demand ot good people
throughout tbe Cbiistian world for its cor
rective treatment will remain unanswered.
President Cleveland in dealing with tbe
Cuban situation unalterably pposes tbe
recognition of tbe insurgents as belliger
ents. He believes the situation to be too
delicate for any intervention on the part
ot tbe United States at the present time,
although bis message strongly bints that
the ultimate outcome may require an ag
gressive stand on tbe part of this govern
ment. With tbe greatest delicacy be de
votes a large portion of bis message to a
review ot the situation and points as a
solution ot the problem, tbe offer to Cuba
on tbe part ot Spain, genuine autonomy.
The insurrection he declare still continues
with all its perplexities. No decision has
been reached on tbe trial at arms. If
Spain bas not yet re-established ber au
thority, neither have the insurgents yet
made good their title to be regarded as an
independent state.
Tbe pretext that civil government exists
en tbe Island, except so far as Spain is
able to maintain ic, bas been practically
abandoned. But that exception being made
the entire country is eitber give over to
anarchy or is subject to a military occu
pation of one or tbe other parties. It is
reported, Indeed, on reliable authority,
that at tbe demand of tbe commander-in-chief
of tbe insurgent army, tli putative
Cnban government bas now given up all
attempts to exercise its functions, leaving
that government confessedly (but there is
tbe best reason for supposing it always to
bave been in fact) a government merely
on paper.
President Cleveland is disposed to ac
knowledge the superiority of the Spanish
arms and of the Cuban tactics. . He says,
bowever, unless a speedy contest in the
open is had, the policy of tbe Spanish gov
ernment not to interfere with the destruc
tion of property will ruin the fertility, pro
ductiveness, end consequent commercial
Talue of the island. Tha mes-age points
out tbe many entangled interests of the
TTnlteil Htates in Cuba. Almost fifty mil
lions of American capital Is invested there,
and the trade before the revolution reach
ed $100,8S1,000 annually.. Our concern in
Cuba is therefore neither sentimental nor
wholly philanthropic, but we are in many
ways, both vexatlously and to much cost,
involved in the present contest. He points
out tbe difficulties which we are subjected
to by reason of the many Cuban residents
Who are naturalized Americans and who
while aiding tbe insurrection through pub
lic meetings, the press, war funds, and
other means, require the constant vigil
ance of tha authorities at Washington.
Besides this, the natural sympathy of the
people of this country with those who
atruggle for a better and a freer govern
ment combined to the adventurous and
restless elements in Europe, makes the
position of the United Htates. in its de
clared neutrality, most-difficult to main
tain. These inevitable entanglements and
consideration of philanthropy and hu
manity in general, have led to a vehement
demand in various quarters for some sort
of positive oontrovention on the part of the
United States. Tbe president declares
against according belligerent rights; does
not think Spain desires to Sell, and depre
cates a war with Spain as a settlement of
the question, on Jbe ground that might is
not sufflelent reason wf his onuntry to vio
late its universal reputation s thn most
pacific of powers, and tbe desire of its peo
ple to live in amity with all the world.
The United States, he says, ha plenty of
territory and should continue to manifest
Its patient endurance, which Is no slight
testimonial to the regard f Spain on tbe
part of tbe American people. While re
membering the part Spain bas played in
the hltory of the western hemisphere,
waiter tbe people nor tbe government of
tbe United States have shut their eyes to
the course of Spain In this contest. After
ucnming up tbe complications of interna
tional law bearing on the case, the presi
dent sayst
It would seem that if Spain would offer
to Cuba genuine autonomy, a measure of
borne rule which, while preserving tbe
overelgnty of Spain, would satisfy all ra
tional requirements of ber Cuban subjects,
there should be no just reason why the
pacification of tbe Island might not be
effected on that b isis. It wuuld put the
prosperity of tbe talma and tbe fortunes
of its Inhabitants within their own oontrol
without severing the natural and ancient
ties which bind them to tbe fmotber
ooootrv.
H bas been Intimated to Spain, and that
oountry does not seem unwilling to adopt
the suggestion, that the United States ao
as mediator in bringing about this result.
At tbe same time Spain da uands that the
lnu gen's lav down their arms before
compromise will be considered, and th
Cubans Insist on something more de"ntte
ban a promise o autonomy before tbey
will consent to do so In any event, tbe
president says, tba United States should
make no attempt to acquire .be island, and
should prevent any other power from
acquiring It. If, however, tbe ability of
SDain to demonstrate its sovereignty be
comes manifest, the United States should
not hesitate to rrcogoize and discharge its
duties without, in any way, mean while
stimulating a disregard to duty or ill-timed
exprssin of feeling Hriefl touching on
t Venezuelan boundary question and the
Bebring sea complications, tbe presld nt
then devotes hims'lf to Internal affairs,
His message takes up In detail tbe Various
debts of tbe na ional government. In tb
treasurv department 1 he receipts for 1896
were $409,475 408.78: expenditures 481,078,

positorS and $210,000,u00 wa,in outstanding
circulation notes. Iwenty-elht new
banks were organized and 37 surrendered
their charters, while for 27 others receivers
were appointed, btate banks to tha nucu
ber tit 6.708 are in existen e.
During tbe year 3f-0,4G8 immigrants ar
rived, bringing to ton country more than
1500.000. In reviewing tbe war depart
ment, toe president does not recominena
an increased army, as be says tbe organ
ized militia numbers 112,879 men, and costs
C3.200.00U anuuallv. which should suilice.
He believes botb te regular army ana
militia should have more money for equip
ments.
Regarding tbe navy, tbe president com
ments on tbe expenditure of money tor
coast defenses, declares bis belief in tbe
ability of tbe government to build its own
ve-sels ana equlpmeots;is opposed to pay
ing anv further speed premiums, and re
commends a plan for loyiug up ships in
reserve, so as to reduce the cost of main
taining our vessels afloat. Eight new
cruisers and two gunboats bave been com
missioned, and the chief executive say
American sbiDS are eanal to anv that float
Tbe president thinks federal oirenaers
should be confined in the government
prisons.
.The DOstofQce department, he savs, is In
good condition, with a aencitoi m.w.wj.
owing to a reduction of postal duties and
tbe Increase, witnout proportionate reve
one. of the low class mail matter.
The total Indian population is 177.235.
Tbe president believes tbe Indians show
improvement under government manage
ment, and recommends that tbey be look
ed after by a commission, one of wbom
sball be an army ofliuer.
President Cleveland hits tbe pension
grabbers a bard blow. He shows-that last
year tbe number of pensioners materially
increased until the list is tbe large -t ever
reDorted. numbering 970,011, and costing
$ldO,Z14.10l
President Cleveland demands tbe settle
ment of tbe Facifio railway loans and
grants, and especially the foreclosing of
tbe Union Pacific mortgage.
He shows, in tbe agricultural depart
ment, that tbe value of farm products ex
ported in 1896 amounted to $570,000,000. He
Is opposed to further gratuitous distribu
tion of seed.
Tbe interstate commerce and civil ser
vice laws are bigbly commended.
w bile admitting a detloit of little more
than $2'i,000 000 the president defends the
Wilson tariff bill as having opened uo
foreign markets and stimulated trade with
other countries. The present but, be says
will yield sufficient revenue if given a fair
trial, out toe aencic was to be expected in
the face of tbe business depression of tbe
past two years. In this connection he de
fends tbe drafts made on tbe reserve fund
as be says it is immeasurably better to ap
propriate our surplus to tbe payment of
justifiable expenses than to allow It to be
come an invitation to reckless appropria
tions and extravagant expenditures.
President Cleveland alludes to our finan
cial methods as weak and vicious and asks
a prompt reform of tbe system whicb is
opposed to every rule ot sound finance and
shown by experience to be fraught with a
grievous peril and perplexity. He refers
to tbe late contest as being a greater men
ace to property than tbe late war. He de
clares financial peace cannot be seemed
until all government currency obligation
upon whicb gold maybe demoded are
withdrawn from circulation and cancelled.
He advocates their exchanging for long
time, low interest bonds. If this is not
done, be thinks sucb currency obligations
when redeemed should be cancelled Instead
of being re issued. National banks should
redeem their own notes. Tbev should be
allowed to issue circulation to tbe par
-value of their dep-isftf, security and tbeir
circulation. Tax should be reduced to one
fourth of one per cent.
Humming up tbe financial situation, the
president says: Tbe entire case may be
presented by tbe statement that tbe day '
of sensible and sound financial method will
not dawn on us uutlt our government
abandons the banking business and the
accumulation of tunas, and confines Its
monetary operations to tha receipt of toe
money contributed by the people for its
support and to the expenditure ot such
money fur tbs people's benefit. Our busi
nes is this, and all good citizens long fur
a rest from the feverish ag tation, and the
inauguration by tbe government of a re
formed financial policy which will encour
age enterprise aud make certain tbe re
wards of labor and industry.
After denouncing the tendency of the
times towards tbe creation of trusts and
monopolies, tbe tendency of which, tbe
president said, is to crush out industrial
independence and to hinder or prevent the
use of human faculties and tbe full devel
opment ot human character, tbe president
appeals to congress to exercise rigid econ
omy. Tbe way of perplexing extravagance Is
easy, but a return to frugality is difficult.
He (hen concludes as follows:
When our differences are forgotten and
tbe contest of political opinions are no
longer remembered, nothing in the retro
speot of our public service will , be as for
tunste and comf irting as tbe recolleotion
of oil! Ill duty well performed and a mem
ory of a constant devo'ion to tbe Interests
of onr confiding fellow-countrymen.
