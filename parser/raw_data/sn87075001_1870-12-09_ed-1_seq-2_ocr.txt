The President's Message.
Thia document was submitted to
Congress yesterday, ni reached u lr
telegraph during , the after noon and
evening.' - - .- ..!.
' For the most part, the message. U a
bare reiteration of facta and assertions
with which the people . are Tamrliar
That the fall election hare surtlcd
the President from hi stolidity, U ap
parently the absurd, not to'suy fake
statement, that "the verdict of the peo
ple haa been reversed" in one of "the
States lately in rebellion; by Tiolenee
; and intimidation." ThU would do very
trail for the Squashtown ' Xadiea!, but
' ita parti ran inaccuracy is certainly out
, of place in a Presidential coirnnuaiea'
tion. '.. ' '..
The President, in treating of our fof-
' eign relatione, aoya a gracious word to
France, for which he merits thank
t lie recommends Congress to bur tip
the Alabama claims from the pi irate
partiea who own them. The object of
thia ieo make them Government pro-
: perty, nd prevent' individual ckim
aata concluding .private settlement
with Great Britain. This; In effect, is
a propoaition to pay iasutaneo compa-
. nie thirteen millions of dollars for a
good substantial cause of quarv! with
. Oreat Britain. The Canadians se
verely criticised .for their stringent
statutes against Mr. Ben: Eutler'a con
stituents, the Essex fishermen. altW
the President state! . he has heard of
ro attempt made to enforce the Cana
uUa laws. Should such an attempt be
made he advisea prompt retaliatory
innaturee. The t'tesideut argues with
force in favor ef the free navigation of
the St. Lawrence, to the sea. by Atner-i.-an

: ' 7 When we come to the pari of the
message treating of San Domingo, the
transition is ae sudden as from a pat
ent ofSce report to Mark Twain. ; The
President fairly bubbles and' sparkles
with enthusiasm in behalf of his pet
project. "After reading lbhtpeH ofthe
: document, one feels that it has ony
been by some peculiar special Provi
dence the country baa managed to ex
ist so long without .San Domingo, and
.that we will be irretrievably damned
as a nation, unless the island is speed

there is a better way," let us hear

'The closing -pdrticn o.f thfci
gentleman s scrmoh is as follows.
"Although the temperance hosts

gigantic work of pretention. ' In

they have averted will be known as

But we can do fnoro. i';itnade

our grasp. We Must study on con
ditions and circumstances, and ad

may be -disappointed because wo
unduly estimate the forces at our
command, but if every lover of vir

secondary, bst as the . first and all
important matter.' Let us organize

victory. I implore yon, heed not
the faint , hearted and vasollatig.
Halt no longer 'twixt two opinions.
If Prohibition of the alcoholic drink
trsiffie be 'right, then follow it. But
if the traffic be right, :men, let your
icfiuerice support it, and remember
Jtbit you cannot' serve God and
mammon, neither can vou bate toe

The time has como when there
can be no neutral ground -. pn this

The issuo is on us, and the liquor

we ready' lo meet them ? The seed
of Prohibition is being sown, and it
will certainly pro lune us fruit, and
oiie of the results will be to prove
who are foe. and who against this
unholy traffic. There can be no
