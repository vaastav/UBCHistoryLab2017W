Washington, Dec. 7. Congress la once
more In Mission and reudy to do busl
ines, or will be by the time this dis
patch is read by the public. The two
houses convened this noon In the
time-honored manner, the hour or so
previous to the fall of the presiding
officers' gavels, showing the floors of
the two chambers scattered over with
groups of congressmen greeting each
other, talking politics, or speculating
on what would be said in the presi
dent's message about Cuba or the
finances, and what, would be done by
this session of congress with reference
to the tariff, the money question or the
pleas of the Cuban rebels for the as
sistance of Uncle Sam.
Mttle To He loue This Week.
Vice President Stevenson, with a rap
of the gavel, called the senate to order
at noon today. The first day of the ses
sion will be devoted almost entirely to
receiving the president's message, pro
vided It is sent in today, as it is gener
ally" conceded that it will be. Immedi
ately after the opening prayer a com
mittee was appointed to notify the
president and the house of representa
tives that the senate was organized
and ready to receive communications
and proceed with business. The first
week of the session la not expected o
be productive of any important results
In a legislative way. There are many
senators who think nothing should be
done beyond the passage of the appro
priation bills at this session, and as
these measures necessarily originate in
the house there will be a disposition to
postpone the season of activity until
nome of these bills can be received from
the other end of the Capitol.
There In Plenty of Work Iteady.
The probabilities are that the dally
sessions at the beginning will be com
paratively brief, and that the senate will
content Itself with four days' work each
week. The calendar presents a wide
range of material for consideration in
case the senate shows a disposition to
busy Itself. In this is included the Im
migration bill, w hich is the unfinished
business; the Pacific railroad refunding
bill, the statehood bills and the Dingley
tariff and bond bills, as well as the
Cuban and Hawaiian questions. Sen
ators Lodge and Chandler have an
nounced their determination to press
the Immigration bill to a vote as speedi
ly as they can. It will be the first regu
lar business to be taken up, and cannot
be displcecl except by vote or unani
mous consent. They hope to get the
bill through before the holidays.
Tariff" Will Wait on a Caucus.
It Is also possible that the president's
message may suggest subjects for
speeches, and there are those w ho pre
dict that the Cuban question will re
ceive vigorous attention from the be
ginning of the session. It Is generally
agreed that the Republicans will hold
a caucus to determine upon a line of
policy, especially with reference to the
tariff, and until after the exchange of
views which this conference will per
mit no step is likely to be taken which
will commit the party to any position
on any question of political significance.
IIOISK LIKKI.Y TO PI SII ItfSlMOSS.
Appoprlatlon Have the Itlght-orWay,
and Two of Them Are Iteady.
The opening week promises to w.q th?
house put its shoulder to the whi-c! of
the regular appropriation bills. Chair
man Cannon and the committee cn ap
propriations w ere at w ork all last week,
and it is their eanest intention to pass
two and possible three of the bills bo
fore the Christmas holdays. The pen
sion and legislative appropriation bills
are about ready, and work on one or
the other of these will be begun In the
house before the week closes. The pen
sion bill, although It carries a larger
amount of money than any of the oth
er supply bills. Is very brief, and unless
some political discussion is precipitated
is not likely to consume much time In
its consideration. Beyond these two
bills nothing is In sight at present. It
Is, of course, not unlikely that the com
mittee on rules will provide something
for the house to do in case the commit
ter on appropriations is not prepared to
go ahead with either of these appro
priation bills.
The course of the legislation, so far as
the Important measures on the calen
dar Is concerned (like the Pacific rail
road funding bill, the Nicaragua canal
bill, etc.), will be determined entirely
by the rules committee. But it Is safe
to assume that nothing will be allowed
to block the appropriation bills as they
are reported for action. They always
have the-right-of-way at the short ses
sion. Today will probably be devoted
entirely to the reading of the presi
dent's message.
CHIPPEWA FALLS OUT OF WATER.
Work of Cleaning Up and (iettlng Into
Itiislneas About Completed.
Chippewa Falls, Win., Dec. 7. Sight
seers to the number of 2,000 visited
Chippewa Falls yesterday. Only streaks
of jagged ice dinging to the fronts
and sides of buildings now mark the
height to which the water of the river
rose, for during Saturday night the
flood receded rapidly and a fall of four
feet is recorded on the gauge near the
C, L., & U. company's mill. The town
is comparatively dry within ten feet
of the river banks. Nothwlthstandlng
the fact that it was Sunday, the town
presented a very busy scene yesterday,
scores of laborers were put to work
early In the morning and by night most
of the streets wore In shape for travel
and a greater part of the stores were
again ready for occupation. It Is con
fidently believed by close observers of
the situation that the river will rauso
no further apprehension this winter.

FIT2 WINS THE FIGHT. .
I lit the Iteferee (Jlvee It to Kharkey on M
Alleged Foul.
Han Francisco, Dec. 3. No event In
the history of pugilism on the Pacific
coast ever uttracted public attention
here as did the battle between the
heavy-welghti Robert Fitzsimmons and
Thomas Sharkey last night. Between
15,000 und 0,000 people occupied all the
available space in the big Mechanic's
pavilion and watched the contest,
which was given to Sharkey in the
eighth round on an alleged foul. Fltr
simmons had the best of the fight all
the way through and indignantly de
nied making a foul.
The referee gave the decision to
Sharkey, claiming that while Sharkey
was falling from Fitzsimmons' left
hook on chin Fitzsimmons struck Shar
key in the groin with his knee. The
foul, if foul it was? could not be seen
from the press stand, but Iteferee Karp
gave his decieion in spite of Fitzsslm
gave his decision in spite of Fitzsim
mons' protests. It was Fitzsimmons
fight from start to finish. He fought
fairly while the sailor continually used
foul tactics. He would clinch and lift
Fitzsimmons from his feet, strike in a
clinch, though the men had previously
agreed not to do so, and he was gen
erally unfair. Several times in the mill
Fitzsimmons had the sailor going, but
could not land a knock-out blow. In
the eighth Sharkey started out to do the
leading, but seldom landed. Hob con
tinually sent m left hand Jabs on Shar
key face, sending his head back every
time.
At first the crowd did not seem to
grasp the situation, but when, it
dawned upon them that the decision
had gone against Fitzsimmons such a
howl of indignation as went up has
seldom been heard in this section. His
ses, curses, groans and hoots split the
air. On the platform In the ring Bob
Fitzsimmons alid Martin Julian were
jumping about and trying to make
themselves heard. Although their words
were unheard their actions were ex
pressive enough. Dismay and disgust
were vividly portrayed. Fitzsimmons
Indignantly denied that he had fouled
Sharkey. He said he had fought falr
yl and there was no temptation for him
to commit a foul, as he knew he had
his m.vn going. Sharkey could not be
seen, lie was carried into his room
by his seconds and followed by a doctor
who examined the Injured sailor.
Sharkey recovered consciousness
about half an hour later. He was ap
parently badly injured, his groin being
swollen. He says he had Fitzsimmons
going until the eighth round when the
foul occurred. Wyatt Karp, the referee,
says the foul was deliberate. Fitzsim
mons, Just before striking his left hook
that apparently knocked Sharkey out,
hit the sailor below the belt with his
fist.
San Francisco, Dec. 4. The city Is
divided to the result of the Fitzslm-mons-Sharkey
fight, which continues
to be the topic of the hour. No one
questions that Fitzsimmons had the
fight practically w on In the eighth round.
Judge Sanderson yesterday granted
the injunction asked for against paying
the 110,000 to Sharkey.
BATTLETn CUBA.
New Which Indicates That Maceo Has
Won a Victory.
Cincinnati, Dec. 4. A special to The
Commercial-Tribune from Tampa, Fla.,
pays: From passengers from Havana
last evening it is learned that rumors
are rife in Havana that a fight has just
occurred between the vanguard of Wey
ler's army and some of Maceo's men,
with large forces on each side. No de
tails are mentioned because, the passen
gers say, the people In Havana are
more than usually reticent, since It
is learned that the Spanish army did
not come off best. It Is believed there
fore that Maceo gained a victory. The
palace people seemed more than usual
ly vigilant and active yesterday, which
Is significant. Two hundred sick and
wounded soldiers were brought into the
city hospitals yesterday from near
Marlel and San Cristobal. It is re
ported in Havana that Weyler has lost
two railroad trains from dynamlce ex
plosions, including much needed army
supplies for his men, sent from Ha

An Interesting Bit of History as Told by a Travel
ling Man, Followed by Affidavits of
Two Prominent People.
From the World Cleveland, Ohio.
After an extruded trip lusting several
mouths aud embracing inuuy points of in
teret throughout the West and South, Mr.
George Lockhart, of Hudson, Ohio, returned
home a few days ao. He ia bright aud
genial as ever and looks as if his long holi
day had thoroughly agreed with hiiu.
Mr. Lockhart's business during his travels
took him frequently to Hot Springs aud
other health resorts. He does not appear to
have been very favorably impressed with
the peculiarities of life at such places, nor
with the benefits received by the patients.
44 Men go there to get cured of disease," says
he. "They take one hot bath in the morn
ing and spend the rest of. the day generally
in driuking, gambling and general dissipa
tion. How they can expect to recover under
such treatment passes my comprehension.
Hut they are, as a rule, what the world calls
good fellows, free with their money aud bent
on enjoying themselves.
"With one man, however, whom I met at
such a place I formed what I hope will prove
a permanent friendship. I am indebted to
him for benefits which have left on my
mind a feeling of the strongest gratitude.
I was, as you know, not at all well. A
slight lameness in my right leg, contracted
about a year ago, bad gradually become
worse until I was compelled to go around on
crutches all the time. Then my general
health failed, and in the latter part of the
summer I hud about concluded to come
home to die. Such a state of affairs, as you
will easily understand was anything out
comfortable. I was, in fact, neither more
nor lefs than a helpless invalid, a nuisance
to myself and everybody around me. It was
at this juncture, that one day ou the train I
fell into conversation with the man I men
tion. He recommended me to try Dr. Wil
liams' Pink Pills. I did so. You see the
result."
Aud Mr. Lockhart expanded his broad
chest and smiled. " Look here," he con
tinued, as Tie took off his hat and holding it
on a level with his head, kicked it easily
with the foot that used to be lame. No
better picture of perfect health and abound
ing ununal Kpirits could be wished fur than
this one-time invalid.
"Mt future movements are uncertain,"
said Mr. Ixx khardt ut parting. " I will re
main in Hudson for some time, but before
the summer is over I expect to make a visit
to Europe."

" Have Pink Pills done me any good ?
What, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
People? Indeed, I should think they have.
"My family have every reason to feel
grateful to Dr. Williams for his wonderful
medicine," said James F. Rose, a geutlernan

County, Michigan.
"I was working with some large logging
wheels lumherimr, some eighteen years ago,

long distance striking on some logs and I

injured my left shoulder. I was uncon

I had consulted physicians and tried a
good many remedies but with no satisfactory
results.
' We read of the Marshall case, of Hamil
ton, Ontario, a wonderful cure attributed to
Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.
I sent for a box of them, and was helped at
once, aud by the time I had taken one box I
could get up out of the chair as spry as any
one, and could run, aud do any kind of work
1 ever could.
" Since taking Pink Pills I have been able
to work at such work as sawing wood roll
ing logs, in fact, I have no occasion to
favor myself on account of my injury. Why,
hut summer I dug a ditch eighty rods long
aud two feet deep. I attribute my freedom
from pains entirely to Pink Pills. It is a
wonderful medicine. I thiuk my wife's cure

Gentlemen: I feel that I should write
you of the benefit I have received from your
Pink Pills for Pale People. I have been a
great sufferer, and for nearly twenty yean
cannot truly say I have seen a well day un
til after I used Pink Pills. I was an invalid
for fourteen years, seven of which I was al
most helpless, and had to be carried when
moved from place to place. I was troubled
with serious stomach troubles, and was con
stantly growing worse. My feet became par
alyzed, then my ankles and afterwards my
knees became paralyzed. We became con
vinced that creeping paralysis had fastened
itself upon me, and my death was thought to
be a matter of only a short time. My husband
had procured some Pink Pills, and as they
were helping him greatly I tried them, and
can truly say of them that they are an ex
traordinary medicine. I have experienced
relief beyond my fondest hope almost. My
Faralysis is a thing of the past, and though
am a woman of sixty-three years, I now
do all my housework, and am enjoying good
health. Thanks to Dr. Williams aud his
medicines.
Signed. Margaret Rose.

" The use of Castoria is so universal and
its merits so well known that it seems a
work of supererogation to endorse it. Few
are the Intelligent families who do not keep
Castoria within easy reach."
