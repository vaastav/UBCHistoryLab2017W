Comptroller Knox yesterday stated that bo
should probably not appoint a Receiver for
the German National Bank of Chicago be
lieving that the bank will bo able to pay oil
its liabilities. This view is concurred in by
tbo baftkers of Chicago and by all who aro
in a position to judge of tho probabilities. ,
Friends of Mr. Cokbuno indignantly deny
that he has received with favor advances from
Mr. Evabts looking to the bestowal of Now
York patronage in return for tho former’s
support of the Administration. Friends of
the Administration should lose no time in
denying that any discreditable advances wore
over made.
Senator Davis, of Illinois, is a firm be
liever in tho Silver bill, and is confident it
will poos the Senate by a heavy vote.' Ho
assumes that every Senator is in favor of tho
bill in some form who voted to make it the
special order for Tuesday, and is evidently
encouraged to hope that the bill may receive
tho necessary two-thirds vote in the event
of a veto.
It tarns out that William 0. Oilman, tho
forger and swindler now serving out a sen
tence in tho Now York Penitentiary, was a
member of the Grand Jury that returned
tho indictment upon which Hookbt L. Cask,
President of tho Security Life-Insurance
Company, was convicted and sentenced.
This fact ought to have a place among the
white marks In Oilman’s prison account.
The proposed amendment to the fire ordi
nance permitting tho unlimited erection of
wooden buildings not over two stories high
13 os to form a continuous cordon of combus
tible material around three sides of the city
was discussed yesterday by the Committee
on Streets and Alleys, and was finally re
ferred back to tho Common Connell without
recommendation. The amendment amounts
to a practical repeal of the fire ordinance,
and ought to be promptly voted down by tho
Council.
Defeated candidates usually find it up
hill work collecting damages of newspapers
which ventilate their records for the enlight
enment of the voters. Mr. Bailbt, of Kala
mazoo, who recently ran for office in that
sity, undertook a levy of #30,000 upon the
TtUgraph on account ol some damaging dls
sloaares which appeared in that journal, but
the jury, after bearing the evidence, failed
to perceive wherein the character of tho
gentleman was injured unjustly, and brought
In a verdict for the defendant.
Cx*UJnlster Wasusunxs’s lecture on 11 The
Siege end Commulie of Paris," delivered last
Bveuiog at the Tabernacle, attracted and in.
'.crested a very large audience. It was an
able and impartial review of the series of
»vonta beginning with the declaration of war
by Nipolion 111. against Germany, includ
log the reginu of the Commune in Paris, and
ending with the entry of the German army
into the French Capital. As liberal au sb*
■tract of the lecture as oar space will allow is
given elsewhere in this issue.
The Turks aro trying desperately to re
lieve Osman Pasha’s army, which is cooped
up in Plevna. If the Osar’s army, which has
surrounded it, forces it to surrender, the
road to Constantinople through the western
passes of the Balkans will be open.
tioLxiUAJf Pasha, whose base is the powerful
fortress of Bbomla on the east, is operating
with a relieving army against the Russian
forces under the Emperor’s son. If he can
break it, he hopes to strike the army which
invests Osmax Pasha at Plevna. Suuuuax
Pasha has about 85,000 men, and the Rus
sian force which he is assailing numbers per
haps CO,OOO, but they fight on the defensive.
and it will cost the Turku dearly to
drive them hack. Bat oven suppose
they were driven back upon the linos of tho
Investing army, eonld Suleiman thou raise
tho siege ? Could tho two separated Turkish
armies defeat tho combined Russian army ?
One thing is certain, that Osman Pasha’s
forces must soon be relieved or they must
surrender, as they are nearly out of provis
ions. They may have scanty food for a fort
night longer, but tho catastrophe approaches
daily and inexorably. Sdleiuan may gain
some advantages over the Czarowieh, but it
Is hardly possible that ho can gain so decisive
a victory as will enable him to raise tfaesiege
and relieve Osman Pasha’s beleaguered army,
which is being slowly starved into surrender.
It is related in tho Washington dispatches
that a friendly interview recently took place
between the President and Senator Patter
on, at tho request of the former. Accord
ing to all accounts, Patterson was consider
ate enough of the President’s feelings to
moke no reference to tho obnsivo por
tions of his Senate speech, and it is
to bo presumed that tho President,
not to bo outdone in delicate considera
tion, made no reference to the yawning
portals of the South Carolina Penitentiary,
Patterson insisted that tho President hod
destroyed the Republican party In Sonth
Carolina, and the President insisted that ho
had done nothing of the sort. Harmony
being thus happily restored, It may bo sup
posed that the interview terminated in the
same spirit of friendship and mutual regard
in which it was begun.
A serious and probably fatal bitch has oc
eurred in tho negotiations for the formation
of a Ministry satisfactory to tho Loft. Mao-
Maqon, presumably swayed by tho appeals
of tho Clericals and Bonapartlsts against the
complete surrender implied in tbo an.
thority given H. Dufaure to organize
a Parliamentary Cabinet, seems to
have recanted at the last moment, and now
insists upon reserving to himself tho sclec
lion of tho three most Important Ministers—
those of Foreign Affairs, War, and Marine.
Dufavoe would listen to np proposition that
contemplates the placing of three Cabinet
colleagues beyond his control, and promptly
withdrew from tho negotiations. M. Batbib
has now been assigned tho office of patching
up a hybrid Ministry, but there is no pros
pcct that tho suddenly-conceived reserva
tions of tho President will bo tolerated by
tho Loft, or that au adjustment acceptable
to tho Chamber of Deputies will bo ac
compllslied.
THE NATIONAL BAVINQ3-DEJPOSITS.
Now that Secretary Sbkbman lias drawn at
tention to tho obvious necessity of a national
system for the safe-keeping of tho surplus
earnings of tho working classes, Congress
will scarcely neglect to take the subject
under advisement and discuss the means
best adapted to the end in view. Secretary
Sheehan's recommendation of such a system
is hosed upon a popular demand that has
been generally expressed since tho many
savings-bank failures of the past year, and
upon tho snocossfnl experience of other Gov
ernments, where Jt bos long been the cus
tom to provide a national guarantee for de
posits of a savings character. Mr. Sheehan
says in bis report t
The attend on of Congress Is called to the (treat
value to nor fellow-citizens of the organisation of
Bomoplan for the collection, safe-keeping. end
profltaolo employment of small pleposlta by the
people. How far tbla can be done without trench*
Ins upon tho proper functions of the State Govern*
moot la a question of difficulty; yet It la Important
to secure, If possible, a general system throughout
the United States. This can hardly be effected by
the organisation of a multitude of savings banka,
depending upon the fidelity, Integrity, and skill of
tnelr officers, but the beneficial objects of such
banks might be secured by authorising tho deposit
of small sums with any postal money-order office
In the United States, and the Issue of Government
certificates, convertible on demand of the holder
Into 4 per ceut bonds of tho United States of
•neb character, description, and amount as will
enable and induce prudent persona to convert
their cantina Into a pnbllo security of stablo
value. The money thos received could be era
ployed In the redemption of outstanding bonds
bearing a higher rate of Interest. Uy some such
system It Is believed that the great body of our
public debt, reduced loitasmallest possible harden,
could be distributed among oar own people. With
a slight modification of existing law this beneficial
result would be secured. The deposits now held
by aavlmra banks throughout the country amount
tolfrta. 104.804, deposited by 2,1100,000 persons,
and mostly by deserving citizens, who thus wisely
seek to preserve small savings for future need. No
object could more strongly appeal to the consider*
ate Judgment of Congress. The heavy losses that
havo Itceo sustained through savings banks, whose
funds have been Improvldcnfly loaned upon Insuf •
fide at security, have Indicted- far greater Injury
npon the depositors than would a similar lost suf
fered by persons engaged la banking arcommerclat
pursuits. Tho Secretary, therefore, recommends
that authority be granted to Issue certificates for
small deposits, convertible Into 4 per cent bonds
now authorised by law, the pioeeuda to bo used
solely for the redemption of bonds hearing a higher
rate of interest, and now redeemable at par.
Tho system recommended by the Secre
tary of the Treasury is, to all intents and
purposes, tbo English system, leaving the
details to bo adjusted to tbo working of the
departments to which It will be attached.
It bos been suggested that a system of bonk
ing in vogae in certain parts of Germany
might supply the need. Under the German
system the deposits are guaranteed by the
Government, which oppoiuts the officers of
the bonks; a regular linking business is
done, loaning by preference to the deposit
ors, who are likewise in some sense stock
holders, os the Interest they receive on their
deposits Is regulated by the profits on the
business. It la apparent, however, that such
a system would be attended by great risks
under our form of Government. A banking
business, done under the auspices of
the Government, and depending for
its honesty and intelligent manage
ment upon officials appointed under
the usaal political Influences, would not be
so safe as the private savings-banks system
which is now so generally condemned. Par
tisan favoritism would induct incompetent
men into the control of tbo banks and lead
to the negotiation of bod loans on worthless
securities; to moke the Government respon
sible for deposits subject to this sort of ma
nipulation would simply be to Impoee.npon
it an annual burden of defalcations and
losses. No system can be adopted'wbich in
volves the necessity of the Government, di
rectly or by agents, doing anything like a
banking business. It is simply a question
of affording absolute safekeeping for sav
iugs-deposits, and paying a small interest
thiireoo, without incurring loss or risk on the
part of either the Government or the de
positors.
The fact that tho Government is a large
borrower, and mast of necessity continue to
be so for on indefinite period, offers the op
portunity for the proposed system of safe
keeping of deposits. Be ore lory Bumas
states that tho aavlngs-deposits of the coun
try amount (o nearly $850,000,000; bat this
is not one-balf the amount which the Gov
- eminent owes, so that the entye sum of
- savinge-depewits coaid bo taken by the Gov
ernment without any loss. In fact, there
THU UHIUAUO TRIBUNE: SATURDAY. DECEMBER 8, 1877-TWELVE FADES.
would bo a decided gain for the Government,
inasmuch as tho deposits dr savings-bonds
would draw only 4 per cent interest, while
tho Government would lake up with tho
fnnds thus acquired the bonds oh which it is
paying ft and ft per cent interest Tho
savings of the French people are largely in
vested in what are called the “ popular
loans,” which is merely another designation
for aavings-bonds; in France H has proved
a national blessing to have tho Govern,
ment debt held by the people, and this
is what tho proposed national savings-syslem
in this country would load to. It will not
bo ncoossary for the Government to hold a
large idle fund of money as a reserve where,
with to meet the withdrawal of deposits.
There will be no panics to contend with
when the savings are intrusted with the Gov.
eminent, but os a rule tbo current deposits
will bo amplo to provide for all the current
withdrawals. As an instance of this, it may
be mentioned that tho National Banks bavo
only been required to keep a reserve of ft per
cent as a for their cirenlaU
ing notes, which ore protected by Govern
ment bonds. No matter how many National
Banks suspend, no bolder of Notional Bank
notes feels a tremor or oven looks to see
whether any of h!s notes ore on tho
suspended banks; the 5 per cent redemption
is sufficient to take care of all the current
demands for redemption, and the bonds are
converted in case of suspension as voluntary
retirement by any particular bank. There
would bo tho same universal and perfect
confidence among, depositors with tho Gov.
eminent; anything like a ran for the with
drnwal of funds could never occur; a very
small reserve would be ample guarantee for
all demands for money, and the groat bulk
of tho deposits (perhaps 05 per cent) wonld
go into 4 per cent bonds, either by the vol.
uutary conversion of the depositors, or by
tho action of tbo Government in taking np ft
, per cents and ft per cents with money on
which it would be paying only 4 per cent in.
terest. The funds in tho hands of tho Postal
Agents receiving the deposits would not be
nearly so largo as would appear at first
thought, and neither the temptation nor op
portunity for frauds and defalcations would
bo materially increased.
There is one phase of the proposed legis
lation which should be kept well in mind.
There is nothing compulsory about tho sys
tern that will at all interfere with savings
banks as a private business, except in so far
as the Government facilities offer a greater
inducement in tho absolute guarantee of safe
keeping. Tho private bonks may go on os be
fore, offering 5 per cent or ft per cent interest,
or any amount they choose, and all those
tempted by the promise of a higher rote Will
be at liberty to deposit with them. But then
tbo risk will rest exclusively with those who
take it, and there can bo no outcry that the
laws are deficient’ in falling to provide a
means for tho safe-keeping of surplus earn
lags. Every man, woman, and child will bo
duly informed that they can deposit their
savings with the Government at 4 per cent,
and that they can withdraw their money or
convert it without notice or delay ; if under
these circumstances their desire for more
rapid accumulation prompt them to trust
private bonkers, It is a matter of business
risk for which they alone will bo responsible.
Just now, we fancy, tho bulk of tho savings
would go into the Government’s hands.
THE SILVER BILL IN THE SENATE.
The preliminary rotes on the Silver bill In
the Senate leave no doubt that a largo mo*
jority of thft body is in favor of tho passage
of the bill. That question being determined,
tho other ono arises, Will tho President veto
tho bill? It is not often that a President
has the opportunity, or, having it, avails
himself of it, to inform Oongrcss of his per*
sonal opinions as to the expediency of a
measure. In this coso tho President, in his
annual message, laid before Congress in
strong and unmistakable language his objec
tions to a bill which had already passed one
House by a four-ill tbs vot e and was then
ponding in tho other House. The theory of
a veto is, that the President, in returning a
bill without his approval, may give such
reasons for his negative that members of
Congress shall be influenced to vote dif
ferently after hearing these - reasons
than they voted on tho first occasion. In
this case, however, tho President’s objections
have been heard in advance. He and the
Secretary of the Treasury have in foot ex
hausted their reasoning in opposition to tho
bill, and a veto message with any expecta
tion of changing votes will be a vain de
lusion. Bo vain woald such a proceeding be,
that it is more than likely that should the
bill pass the Senate by a two-thirds vote,
tho President would coniine his action to a
protest such os other Presidents "have done
under similar circumstances. Should he,
however, veto the bill, what are the pros
pects of Its receiving the two-thirds vote
necessary to make It a law 7 With the ad
mission of Eoaris, of Louisiana, the Senate
will consist of seventy-six members, and, if
oil ora present, fifty-one votes will be re
quired to pass a bill over a veto. The Sena
tors have, by their votes and otherwise,
nearly ail expressed an opinion on this ques
tion, and tho Senators may bo classified as

Of those put down as doubtful, the two
Senators from Oregon, and Mr. Gamzsom of

however, are Messrs. Hux of Georgia, La
vas of. Mississippi, Kvixoao of Louisiana,
and Ohsutxaxct of Michigan, all of whom
represent constituencies overwhelmingly in
favor of the unlimited remonetization of
silver. There in hardly an opponent of sil
ver in either Georgia, Mississippi, or Louisi
ana, ftnd the policy of increasing tho value
of gold by making it tho exclusive metallic
currency will receive no’ favor in those
States. Tho only Senator from tbo West
and Northwest who has intimated an
opposition to tho Silver 1)111 Is Judge
Christianot, of Michigan. That ho is op
posed to the bill is not yet certain,
and it will be a surprise and a regret to the'
whole people of Michigan if ho shall sepa
rate himself from tho mass of bis country
men to vote with tho scctionaUsta of Now
York and Now England to reduce tho metal
lic currency of tho country to gold, giving
to that metal an increased valne, and causing
a corresponding depreciation in the value of
land and all other property. Tbo good peo
ple'of Michigan will perhaps bo somewhat
astounded if tho passage of tho Silver bill,
over oil forms of opposition, shall be defeat
ed by the vote of one of their Senators. In
tho meantime, a week nearly has to elapse
before a vote can ho taken on this subject,
and In that time it will bo ascertained how
many Senators who are now classed ns doubt
fnl will vote on* this question, which is now
o national one, —the people on One aide, tho

A CANADIAN BED ELEPHANT.
Wo bad thought that tho locum tenon* as
well as tho quid pro quo in tho caro of Sit
ting Bull had been satisfactorily settled,
and that wo should hoar no moro of that
unpleasant individual, or any of his squaws,
papooses, ponies, and dogs. Tho United
States substantially gave a quit-claim deed
for Srrrmo 8011, and the Canadians took
him, for bettor or worse, with all his incum
brances and liabilities, and made themselves
responsible for his future good conduct
They assigned him a reservation, placed him
on it, granted him ample hunting-grounds,—
in foot, set him up ns a housekeeper In good
shape, and gave him a handsome house
warming. Now it appears, however, that
they want to got rid of him, fearing that ho
Is going to prove a troublesome customer
and will not keep his peace, but any day
may start on an expedition after Canadian
scalps and other loot. They oro sorry now
that Sitting Bull did not close with Gen.
Tumi's propositions, and Maj. Walsh, tho
Burgomaster of S. B.’s bailiwick, has been
seeking to convince him that ho did not
understand Oon. Tebbt’s lino offer, and has
done himself agreat injustice in notoccoptiug
it. Maj. Walsh’s anxiety that Sitting
Bull shall do the fair thing by
himself does not seem to mako any very de
cided impression upon that gentle savage,
however. Ho seems to bo content with his
lot and satisfied to stay where ho is; bat,
whetbor ho be or not,' tho people of this
country, without regard to sex, color, or
previous condition of servitude, will firmly
and emphatically protest against any policy
that promises to restore Sitting Bull and
his dirty pack within their borders again.
Such a policy, in tho first place, would bo
an injustice to Sitting Bull blmsoU and his
numerous family. He wants to stay in
Canada. Ho wont there with the intention
of staying. At the conference with tho Com
missioners he voluntarily announced himself
os a British citizen and a snbjcotof his great
grandmother, tho Queen. Although covered
all over with blood himself, he would have
nothing to do with Gen. Tsanr, “ who has
blood on bis hands.” He was confident that
his groat-grandmother would treat him bet
tor than bis Groat Father at Washington
had done, and for that reason ho hod
taken his squaws, papooses, and other mis
cellaneous traps, and crossed the borders.
Ho wants to stay because ho does not
like the people of this country, and the peo
ple of this country want him to stay because
they do not like him,—this being the only
point on which the two over agreed. Ex
patriation and denationalization have al
ways been regarded with favor hero. Wo
accept foreigners and naturalize them, and
wo part with citizens, not complaining if
they denationalize themselves. It is looked
upon as a fair exchange. In Sitting Bull's
cose, we should never complain if we did
not receive any equivalent. We handed
him over without lookiug, and don't desire
to toko him back. It was a fair and square
bargain, and was not mode at onr motion
either. SrrriKO Bull wanted to go and the
Canadians wanted him to come, and took
him os a full-fledged British subject before
he bad been over the border twenty-four
hours. When oar Commission subsequently
sought to treat with B. 8., ho invited the
members “to go to hell," aud, wrapping his
home-blanket about him, struck a pose ss
defiant as that of Oxnus when be
threatened Bblshazzah, placed himself
under the wgi* of England's power,
and proclaimed himself a “ Worsted British
er." They took him on their own terms
without oven consulting us, and we prefer now
that they keep him. So far from feeling
aggrieved or entertaining any suspicions that
the Canadians got the better of us in the
trade, wo have lots more of the same sort of
damaged goods that we will send them in the
original package on tho same terms if they
will accept them, or we will swap them for
muskrats or yellow dogs. It Is bad enough
to have five and half millions charged up
against us on the fisheries account without*
being compelled to take Sitting Bull back.
We would rather call tho account ten millions
than have him and his crowd again, and, In
fact, pay a little something towards bis board
and stand prep wed to furnish the Canadians
with a lot more just like him. It is too late
for Maj. Walsh to bamboozle Sitting Bull.
He doesn't want to come bock and we don't
want him to come. If the Canadians find
they hove drawn a red elephant that la likely
to prove an ugly customer, that is none of our
lookout. The trade was not of our seek
ing. If Maj. Walsh can't keep him qul«t,
he had better bong him or send him to
Botany Bay.
The fraud* which hate been committed In
the conatruotion of the St. Louie Custom-
House are of the moat serious kind, and will
probably require a large part of the work to
be done over. The evidence which has been
brought out U the trial of one of the guilty
persona before the United States Court
shows that spore than half of the hundred
piers on which the building rests are filled
with eoncre te,whereas tbaspecifications called
for solid atone. The exterior appearance of
each pier is that of one honestly built of
solid blocks; but the experts appointed to
examine the work testified that, in five piers
out of six bored into, the interior was made
up of spall and cement The testimony on

The work as it stands is snffioiont proof of
rascally conduct on tbo part of the contract
ors and tho Government inspectors. Tho
latter officials are, if anything, more guilty
than tho contractors; and justice should lay
hold of them at onco and make examples of
them. This is a case in whiofi responsibility
cannot be evaded. Public opinion will not
be satisfied until tho officials who betrayed
the Qovortuncnt in this scandalous manner
see the inside of a Penitentiary. Tho offense
against public morals, it will be observed, is
two-fold t not only has the Government been
robbed outright by tbo delivery of an article
only half os expensive as that tor which It
contracted, but, in the second place, tho
safety of tho community boa been endan
gered. If tho building were completed on
tho present piers it might fall in rnlus at any
time, and Involve an enormous loss of life.
Having recollections of similar frauds in
other places, and tho fatal consequences that
followed upon 'them, tho public will not bo
in tho mood to trifle with these offenders.
They should be punished by tbo severest
sentence permitted under tho law.
An extraordinary pressure was brought to
bear upon Gov. Youno, of Ohio, to induco
him to pardon tho murderer Briioen, who
was hanged yesterday. The dispatches say
that some or all of tho officers of tho law
concerned in securing the conviction of
Bksoen signed the petition for his ponton.
How many of the officers joined in this poll
tlon is not known; but it not infrequently
happens that tho Judge who presides ot tho
trial of a murderer, tho attorney who prose
cutes bilfl, and the jury who convict him,
aralst a movement to release him by tho
exercise of Executive clemency. A more
scandalous prostitution of justice cannot bo
conceived. Tho officers of the law cither
perform their duty or they do not when they
find a criminal guilty and sentence him.
When they have not done their duty, they
have laid themselves open to criminal prose
cution; when they have done It, tjioir con
nection with tho case ceases. They ore not
appointed to go into tho sentiment of
the case, or to turn the machinery of justice
upon itself. As tho representatives of. tho
law, they arc bound to insist upon tho exe
cution of its sentences. The contrary course,
which • Is now so often pursued, Is bringing
tho law itself, as well* as the persons who
administer it, into contempt, and encourag
ing crime by making the commission of it
safe. Adairs have already reached such a
pass in many of tho large cities that the
criminal courts are not respected even by
good citizens, and it only needs a slight
change for the worse to induce them to exe
cute summary punishment upon conspicuous
odondors. The innocent lives that may bo
sacrificed in this manner will be chargeable os
much to the weakness of men now appoint
ed to execute tho law as to any innate de
pravity of good citizens. It should under
ordinary circumstances bo a bar to tho re
election of any public officer that ho bos
joined In a petition for the pardon of any
criminal whom ho has helped to convict.
THE VOTING OP THE TEAS.
The tout 1877 hat, of course, been an u off
year,” but by no means so much of an off-year
as people will thick. The people of twenty-four
States have been summoned to tho polls, name
ly of:
California, Maine, New Jersey,
Colorado, Maryland, New York,
Connecticut, Massachusetts, Ohio,
Gcorg.o, Mlcbiaon, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Minnesota, Iliiodo Island.
lowa, Mlsshslppl, Vlremla.
Kansas, Nebraska, West Virginia,
Kentucky. New Hampshire, Wisconsin.
The total rote cast in these States was about
three and three-quarter millions—that (s to any,
something over a half of tho voters of tho nation
have been Invited to declare their political
preferences. In not nil of these States, how ever,
were the elections of a character to have value
In the eyes of the student anxious to derive
some positive information from tho facts and
figures presented. For Instance, In California
the State vote was on the non-partisan proposi
tion to call a Constitutional Convention, though
tho elections for tho Legislature gave a decided
Democratic victory, and insured the return of a
Democratic Senator In the room of Mr. Sahobmt.
This result was, bowuwr, largely due to tho Re
publican revolt against the San Francisco ring.
In Colorado, the only candidate voted for was
on both tickets, and there was no psrlr lino
drawn on the question of female suffrage. In
Connecticut, party matters did not enter Into
the discussion of the constitutional amendments
submitted, but the Republicans made gains
In the Legislature, and on tho aggregated vote
for Sheriffs bad a majority In the State. In
Georgia the voting was on propositions affecting
a State Constitutional Couveutlon. In Illinois
on tho State-House appropriation. These five
States, therefore, we omit from our general
tables, os for quite other but'still sufficient
reasons wo omit four others. These are Minne
sota, Mississippi, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Though Minnesota gave a wholesome majority
for the Republican ticket, no complete returns
are up to the time of writing available. In
Mississippi and Virginia there have been no re
turns,—there was nq necessity for any returns,
the Democratic nominees having bod a “walk
over." In West Virginia tho vote waa on a
proposition affecting toe location of tho State
Capital.
There remain, therefore, fifteen Slates where
fair, stand-up fights took place, and almost all
of these were Important States. The list in
cludes the great States of Massachusetts, New
York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and among those
which are closely balanced or susceptible to the
slightest vibration of ' the political needle are
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
We have, thus, a very fair corpus of statistics to
work upon. True, there are some minor
discrepancies which will slightly affect the
tables, but la tbe long run these will about
counterbalance each other. For Instance, if In
lows Gian's scratching by tbe Prohibitionist
Republicans cuts downtbeßepublican strength,
In New York the Democrats lose some 10.00 U
or lk,ooo votes by taking tbe poll for Secretary
of Slate, for which they ran the smirched Mr.
Bxacu.
With these explanations and reservations,
tbe following table may be given of tbe returns
from fifteen fitftes, moat of tbe figures being

The total vote of the States included in the
above table was 0.400,415, as against 4,5r8,800
votes last year for President, the counties and
towns not reported this year being omitted to
the latter calculation. The falling off In the
total vote fs therefore a fraction under 95 per
cent <213-6 per cent, to bo more accurate), and
as upon this basis the vote Is barely less than
(hat cast for President five years ago, the fact
remains that for an "off year ” there was an un
usually keen Interest taken In politics.
Wo may compare the rote actually cast this
year with that brought out last November,
when almost every voter In the country went
to the polls. The showing Is as follows:

The falling: off Is as nearly as possible 25 per
cent. If ft were assumed that the same per
centage'applied to all parties, wo should expect
the Republicans to ca«t 1,738.310. They Old
cast 1,017,714,—» falling off of 120,003, toaccount
for which there are the Labor and Greenback
movements In Ohio so actively fermented by
tho Democrats to draw* off Republican votes;
and in Pennsylvania tbc same movements cut
ting down Republican majorities In such strong
holds as Luzerne, and tho opposition to the
Philadelphia ring, besides the secret opposition
of tho Cambronb. Alter making allowances
for all theso causes, there Is a very small margin
left fur tho loss to the party caused by (hat dis
satisfaction of tho “old wheel-horses” and
“rank and flic” of which we have beard so
much—ld sheets hostile to tho President. True,
tho Democrats, who do not carry pencils on
election day and turn out faithfutlv In all
weathers have made considerable gains for tho
time, but not until tho Congressional elections
next November can wo form anything like an
accurate estimate of tho extent of tho Influence

Tho boarding-house keepers of New York
havu never been accused of dullness or loattcn
tion to their own Interests. In fact, Rome of
their devices would do credit to tho fine taste
and discrimination that have always character
ized a certain avenue of Chicago on tho South
Side. A notable cose is reported os happening
lu a fashionable up-towo boarding-house of the
first-mentioned city. The residents of this
luxurious caravansary have for a long time past
annoyed the worthy lady who acts os the pre
siding deity of the establishment by
eating a larger amount of food than tho
circumstances and tho price of board
appeared to warrant. Accordingly a plot
was concocted by tho landlady and a devoted
adherent of tho landlady's eldest daughter,—a
plot which was scarcely loss horrible and cer
tainly more ingenious than tho one which was
once Invented for tho purpose ot blowing np
the entire English Parliament. It was Just be
fore the usual dinner hour, and tho young men
of the establishment were Just sauntering In
after a brisk walk up Broadway and two fingers
of something to stimulate their already-cnor
mous oppotites up to the point of mad voracity,
when there appeared at tno parlor door tho
figure of the devoted attendant of tho
landlady’s daughter, apparently no long
er In bis right mind, but raving,
and shouting, and swinging his arms about In a
tragic and really dreadful manner. Naturally
all the young ladles who were anywhere lathe
vicinity of people of the opposite sex Immedi
ately fainted, and pea can but faintly describe
the scene that ensued. It was not until after
tho wretched adherent had gone to a neighbor
ing saloon with tho avowed object of procuring,
a horrid Ice-pick wherewith to licw tho young
ladies and gentlemen of tho establishment Into
fragments that a oollcemau was' called,
tho doors barricaded, and the dinner-bell rung.
Alas I wbat was tho agony of that wretched
landlady, when Instead of naving, as sho had
anticipated, an Ihnuly. dluner-lablo, found to
her horror that all tho young gentlemen and
ladles hod recovered their presence of mind, and
that they rushed into tho dining-room with oven
more alacrity than usual. Sufficient to relate
that the plot was a dead failure, and the lond-
Jody bad not only tho unhappiness of seeing
her cherished hopes decay on tho very eve of
fruition, but was obliged to pay a fine of 910 to
extricate the devoted adherent from the Tombs,
where ho bad been remanded by the guardians
of tho municipal peace.
The British House of Commons appointed a
Committee to W7U to Investigate and report tho
cause of the great decline In the bullion value of
silver. The following Is an extract from the
testimony of one of tho ablest financiers In
Great Britain. Thera was no higher authority
than BAonaoTon such a subject, as no man
had investigated closer or more intelligently:*
Minutes of Evidence, Pago 03, July, 1770. Mr.
Waltsu Uaosiiot called in.

1 believe, editor of the Seonomutf Answer—
Yes.
Question 1,3(12—1 think you have given particu
lar attention to this silver question? Answer—
Yee.
Question I,4o4—'Turning to another subject, the
evidence before the Committee. 1 think, has been
generally to tho effect that tho'depreciation of sil
ver has been esosed by the Increased production,
or the impression produced by the Increased pro
duction in America, by tho demonetization m Ger
many, sun by the increase of drafts of the Indian
Council. Do you agree in the existence of these
causes? Answer—l talnk these causes aro real,
but 1 think a fourth ought to be added to them.
Question I,4os—What Is tho fourtn causer An
swer—A great number of butes which are grouucd

ceased to coin silver ever slncu tue year 1U74 in Ms

tee are aware the Latin Union is a nine tor five

call a double standard—that U to say, stiver and
gold were tenders for any amount for debt*. and
the coinage was framed on the relation of 1814 to
1. Up to that lime it was open to anybody to go to
tho French or any otoer mints, with silver or gold,
as the esse uilgut be, and get it coined. The con
sequencu of course was that the moment metal be
came depreciated the holde-s took it to those mint#
sod had it coined. But in the year 1874 that proc
ess was arrested, because these Uovernmenls
limited the amount of silver which they
would coin, and if if Aod not bun for that ehanot

The dUHcuity of arriving at a fair decision In
case of inch disagreement has become goner*
ally rtcognlxed, and has given rise to a com*
moo proverb which It Is quite unnecessary lo
quote under the present: circumstances. But
there Is a tolerable degree of safety lu assert*
tog that the quarrel between Dr. William Cab
ysnißß and Mr. William Cbookbs can bo
arbitrated upon in a manner which should be
satisfactory to tbe public, if not. to one of the
scientific gentlemen coasted In It. Dr. Oak*
pbmtbb Is a physiologist of high standing in
England, and Ur. Cbookbs Is an investigator
of Spiritualism and the Inventor of an lustra
meat called the radiometer, which tbe good
brethren who attend Elder Willing's Monday
meetings would regard as a kind of diaboli
cal dispensation. ' U their attention were
duly called thereto. This radiometer is a pet
hobbv of Mft Caooais*, tod by Its means he
proposes to make 'grand discoveries in tbe
hitherto comparatively unexplored fields of
psychology. What was bis chagrin, therefore,
when tu a recent number of JlTofurs there ap*
ppeared a paper devoted to ridiculing the radi
ometer god Us pretensions, and declsrlug that
Ur. Chock as bad wrongly Interpreted his own
results by attributing (he motion of the soils ol

the radiometer t > tlic direct Impact of clcrtrl Q
waves. Now. Mr. Crookes, being n scientific
mankind therefore Presumably of a ptilloaonMe
temper, might well hare trfisted Ids radiometer
to reveal It* own inwardness and vindicate it,
own reputation. Hut that was precisely what
Mr.CROOKB* was unable to do. Ho chose rather
to direct a fiery eolstlo to Dr. Carpenter,
even ended In several of his friends to jo'n
with him in the fray, which has raffed over since
with unabated fury. Mr. Atrnim Wau.acb
and Prof. J. Cart Foster ore among the par
tfclpanta In this literary war, whlcn has not In
anity been likened to unfortunate events which
Interrupted the proceedings of Mr. Brbp
Hartb’s Stanislaus Society. At present writ
ing It has reached the since when such ad
jectives as •'knave,” •‘fool," etc., ore common
expressions, and readers of the scientific Jour
nals of fJrcat Britain are paralyzed with a con
slant dreod that these great and good scientists
will have each other's gore. Lest a similar im
pression might prevail In this country, w«
.hasten to assure our readers that such a calam
ity Is quite beyond the bounds of probability
the radiometer not being a weapon that will go
off.

quently Simula tho waters escape this first pinch of

American manufacturers have got to learn
that tnclr market la tho world. Wo have been
so accustomed to regard Importing as the nor
mal and exporting the exceptional state of
things that the present success ot American
goods In foreign markets is looked npon a* a
transient phenomenon ot trade. Tho Phila
delphia Exhibition helped greatly to disabuse
tho public mind of this Idea, and It Is to bo hop
ed that for their own Interests atone, to say
nothing of national pride, merchants and man
ufacturers will hove a complete representation

that manufacturers study carefully the Con

now publishing In tho newspapers, os many of
them state explicitly what articles can be sold,
and bow they must be made, to common! a
