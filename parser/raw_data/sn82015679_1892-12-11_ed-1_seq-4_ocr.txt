London, Dec 10. Both in England and
la Germany the stzns of agricultural dis
tress are increasing rapidly. The standing
armies of the two countries combined,
moreover, era not bo numerous as the great
crowds of unemployed who walk the streets
in the RTeat cities. Ia this country Mr.
Asquith and iir. Shaw-Leferre are kept at
their wit's end to find for the Cabinet sat

delegations for work. In Berlin the Minis-

secretaries answering the written com
plaints of boards of trade, miners' commit
tees and agrisultural societies. From the
,remote famine-stricken provinces of Rus
sia and the agricultural provinces of Aus
tria and Hungary come tne appeals of half
starved peasants to swell the cry of dis
tress. DurlDg this week the small British farm
ers gave utterance to their troubles at the
agricultural conference in St. James Hall.
The speeches for protection, and bimetall
ism, and such other panaceas as the spokes
men suggested, give an inadequate idea of
the feeling of tne majority of the men
present. A reporter amoDg the groups at
the entrance heard bitter complaints that
the men were ashamed to make before the
whole assembly. "Are we to be starved
for a ilieorjl" shouted one man from the
door when Francis Smith made his plea
(rem trie platform for free trade. "Give
as the old corn laws, or we
will go to Canada," the speaker
then added. "If my children . were
cot all grown and married I should bo
obliged to emigrate to America and begin
sgain. old as 1 am. Thousands of north of
Logland farmers are no better off. If the
government does nothing for us hundreds
will leave for the States to save their fam
ilies from absolute want. I have lost 1,000
s year for the last live years. My wife has
but two dresses, and 1 have on my only suit
of clothes."
John Burns said in a meeting on Wednes
day that agricultural laborers had been
driven by the bard times from tneir homes,
had sought work in the city, and thereby
had swelled the number of unemployed in
London, Liverpool. Manchester and Bir

In Germany even the rich provinces in
the Khino country have their thousands of
'unemployed and half-fed families. This
fact has moved the chambers of commerce
in Munich. Stuttgart, btrasburg. Cologne
aud Mannheim, to protest against the bill
' bf fore the Reichstag to retard emigration.
The, whole measure they contend is un
timely, ill-digested, ana calculated to ag
gravato the sutlencg caused by tbepresent
depression of agriculture and trade. Vbilo

the desire to prevent abuses by emigration
agents and to stop the practice of running

THE GERMAN ARMY BILL.
Dpenlng- of the Debate In the Reichstag
Caprlvl Change III Tactics.
Copy nfrlit, 1302, by the Associated Press. 1
Berlin, Dec. 10. On the eye of the first
reading of the army bill. Chancellor Von
Caprivi gave a parliamentary dinner that
was unique in character, as bringing to
gether both members ot the Keich
'fltaj of all parties, except Socialists,
.who mingle with Ministers, members of
the Bnndezrath and high state officials. It
was a motley crowd. For the first time
leading journalists were invited to partake
at such a banquet. Such various organs
as the North German Gazette, the Vossiche
Zeitong, the Tageblatt, the Post, the Lon
don Times and the Telegraph and
the Vienna Kue Frie Presse sent their
representatives, all of whom re
ceived a cordial greeting from the
Chancellor. It was a memorable - recog
nition of the influence of the press, and
- marked an epoch in the life of German
journalism. Among such a mixed throng
politics was little talked about. The Ahl
wardt trial was the subject of much con
versation, and advocate Mnnkel, Herr
Loewe'a counsel, had to submit to much
good-humored banter.
While the dinner was proceeding at the
Chancelloire the Socialists were holding
meetings In every electoral district in Ber
lin and protesting against the army bill.
Aeurejve orations were delivered which
evoked frequent warningsNfrom the police
who were present at the meetings. Resolu
tion were adopted denouncing militarism
and nrgin the formation of a peoplo'n mili
tia. A new feature of the meetings was the
'lur attendance of women, who. by their
lervid enthusiasm, gave more trouble to
the oolice than their Socialist brothers
dared to cause.
When the Uebato on tho army bill opened
in tho Reichstag, to-day, the hoase was
crowded and the galleries were full of visit
ors. The tenor ot the speeches from all sides
disclosed no uncompromising hostility to
the measure. Major Von Honingen-Huene,
a member ot the Central party, announced
tbat the Centrists were willing to concede
the redaction of a year in the term of serv
ice, but were not prepared to increase the
strength ot the ntanding army. His open
ing remarks seemed to indicata downright
opposition to the bill, but he altered his
tono as he proceeded, and admitted that
the meaaure would be flailed by the coun
try as adding to the defensive strength of
the empire, and probably even as leading
xo an alleviation oi tne economic situation.
lie concluded by expressing the hope that
the Center party would arrive at an entente
with the government.
Herr Kichtereaid the Freisinnige party
would grant whatever funds were necessa
ry for the introduction of a system of two
years' eervioa, bnt added that the Chan
cellor would have to apply to a more com
placent Reichstag than the present one to
obtain demands beyond that. He contended
that the bill would raise the extraordinary
budget to the extent of 200,000.000 marks.
The two years' service system, he said, was
desirable, bnt to increase the number of
men at such a cost was unnecessary.
Tho Chancellor's response to the speeches
against the bill was mainly directed at
Herr Kichter. and his language was sar
castic. Ho styled Herr Kichter an able po
litical statistician, but said he was scarcely
In a position to otter a reliable opinion on
the details of military system. On this
subject views that were authoritative in
the highest military circles must have the
most weight. "Ho convinced am 1."
said the Chancellor, "of the necessity of
the bill lor the continued existence of
Germany that If the Keiohstag wished to
throw upon me its own responsibility, I
wculd tranquilly accept it" This state
ment was greeted with cheers. Continu
ing, the Chancellor said under the provis
ions of the bill sixty thousand young men
would be yearly added to the army, so that
in a few years 4oO,(XXJ more men would be
ready to tako the field aguinst a hostile
army. This statement also elicited
cheers. The Chancellor appealed to the
house not to throw the country into con
jnsion by rrgectintr the measure.
General on Kattenborn-btachau de
clared that Germany must be prepared to
enter at any moment into a final war which
would dirarf all preceding wan in the mag
nitude of the forces engaged andof the is
ene to be decided. It was imperative
that every man in Germany able to
hear arms should be ready to respond
when called. The bill was a measure ot su
preme necessity aud demanded no sacrifice
' that the patriotism of the nation should
to the wilhntito grant and no sacrifice
greater than what other nations were
making in preparation fo? the mighty
trugjle that might at any time be
gin. It was in obedience to the supreme
.need of Germany for that struggle that
the bill had been prepared, and the
government hoped and expected that it
wouid receive the support of every one in
terested in maintaining the integrity of the
fatherland and in defending thse advant
ages which it had coetsomuchot German
.blood and German enemy to obtain. The
"War Minister described at lenoth the
details of the bill, and showed that
every effort had been made to make
the burden an light as a prudent
regard for tbeJS security of the coutry and
the efficiency of the army would permit.
The address was favorably received, and
the utterances of General Von Kattenborn-
Stachau in reuard to the almost certainty
of a (treat European war at an ' early
date evidently produced a profound
impression ns confirming the predictions of
Chancellor Von Caprivi on the same sub
ject The geeral opinion in tho lobby
after the house aljoorn-d was that the bill
would pass its hrst reading by a good ma
jority. ,

Princess May Afttontshes a Cruel Coster Who
, Wan Kemttnr Ills Dnnkrjl .
London, Dec. 10. Princess May, who was
betrothed to the late Duke of Clarep.ce aDd
Avondale, gave another instance yesterday
of her kindliness of heart. She was driv
ing in Hammersmith when she came upon
a coster who was beating his donkey in a
most cruel manner. Princess 31 ay ordered
her coachman to stop and directed her
footman to deprive the coster or the stick
with which he was beating his animal.
The Princess spoke to the coster, but was
greeted with a shower of abuse of the low
est kind. Tho man demanded the name
of tho woman who had dared to inter
fere with what ho considered his rights.
The Princess intormed htm who she was
and the man was dumfounded. when he
learned that he had been abusing one so
near the Cjueen, and one who is universally
loved for her generosity and sweetness of
character to the poor. He begged pardon
in a most humble way. The Princess for
gave him and then lectured him on his
cruelty. The police bad been attracted to
the scene aud they would have arrested the
man had it not bneo for the intercession of
Princess May. She also asked the officers
not to report the insults that the man had
ottered her.
Mrs. Majbriek's Health.
London, Dec 10. The Evening Stand
ard says it has the best authority for
stating that Mrs. Maybrick is recovering
from theeCects of hemmorhage with which
she was recently attacked. The paper adds
that her illness was due to her own care
lessness. The Baroness De Ttoques. Mrs.
May brick's mother, telegraphs frtfin Wo
king that her daughter passed a bad night,
and is sufiering from great weakness.
In an interview to-day Baroness de
Koques, mother of Mrs. Maybrick. said: T
have just returned from a visit to my
daughter. iShe took a little jelly to-day,
the first rood she has taken since Monday.
Mie is unable to sleep. She eaid to-day,
'Mamma, I really do not wish to live, if I
have to remain here. I am in such a state
of exhaustion it would be very little to die
oil. 1 would rather, do bo than exist here.'
She 19 so weak that she is unable to raise
her head. My son died in my arrait of con
sumption, and I know that my daughter's
symptoms are the same. 1 have seen her
three times in a week for live minutes at
a time. I do hope that the authorities will
allow me to nurse her myself. "
The Monetary Conference.
Brussels, Dec. 10. At to-day's meeting
of the committee of the international mon
etary conference the plans of Messrs. Tiet
jen, Honlds worth and Allard were debated.
Frauce, M. Tiraud Baid, was entirely satis
fied with the present system as assuring an
abundance of money. It was impossible
that the Latin Union could think of oi
metallism while Germany, Belgium and
England refused toopen their mints for free
coinage. Therefore, M. Tiraud said, the
conference must abandon the hope of reach
ing any radical solution of the problem
and apply itself to securing some moderate
measure of relief. He would himself earn
estly co-operate in carry iniTHnch a measure
to success. The address of M. Tiraud made
a profound impression, and quenched any
remaining hope of radical action in favor
of bimetallism. The committee adjourned
without reaching a decision on any of the
plans before them.

Loxd.-n, Dec. 10. The sentencing of the
Jow baiter Ahlwardt, n -Berlin, to five
months' imprisonment for slander was re
ceived favorably by all Berlin dailies this
morning, except tho Kreuz Zeitung. Ahl
warlt accused the Loewe . firm of
gun-makers of wholesale bribery of
army Inspectors and of criminally defective
work in making 4,000 riiles for the Ger
man army. While nobody contends that
he even tried to prove these charges true
they acknowledge that ho has got1 the
Loowes in a tight enrncr. Without prov
ing corruption he showed that small
fire-arms of the.German troops would be al
most useless in war. "If in maneuvers
seventy cut of a hundred guns were ren
dered useless." says Prince Bismarck in the
Hamburg Nachnchten, "what could be ex
pected in actual war."

Republicans Will Not Be Idle When Demo

VTA9iiiNGT0.v, Dec. 10. While the Dem-
ocratio advisory committee is confer
ring in New York and devising; plans
for securing the election of Demo
cratic Senators in the doubtful legislatures
in Wyoming, California, Montana. North
Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, there is a
conference of Kepublicans being held here
in Washington having just the
opposite purposes. Some . of the
leading spirits of the Kepubhcan party
are at the Arlington. Mr. J. S. Clarkson,
Warner Miller, C. N. Bliss. General Alger
George M. Pullman, General Estee, Joseph
Manley and P.epresentative Johnson, of
North Dakpta, were assembled in the lobby
of the 'hotel this morning. It was said
that their meeting was by ac
cident, that there was no politics
in it Both Mr. Manley ' and Mr.
Clarkson told a reporter that the
meeting was accidental. It was quite a
coincidence that they should all have hap
pened here on the same day and to have
stopped at the same hotel. It was ex
plained that Mr. Manley was here on pri
vate business, that Mr. Clarkson was on
bis way to Mexico, that Mr. Bliss was go
ing to Florida, that Mr. Miller was here to
look, after the Nicaragnan. canal business,
and that General Estee had business beforo
the Supreme Court.
About 11 o'clock in the morning they all
retired to a private room to discuss the
coincidence of their meeting. General
Eatee and Mr. Johnson, who are not par
ticularly close in their association with
other gentlemen as to render their presence
a thing to be expected as a matter of
course, are quite familiar with the sen
atorial situation in California and North
Dakota. It is understood that
the other subject discussed after
the coincidence of their meeting
was disposed of was the senatorial situa
tion in the seven doubtful States, and that
plans were perfected to meet the move of
the Democratio senatorial advisory com
mittee, who are trying to secure the elec
tion of Democrats to complete the Demo
cratic control of Congress. The whole sub-'
ject, it is said, was thoroughly canvassed,
and some of those present were satisfied
that tho Democrats could bo kept from
having a majority in the Senate if the
proper sort of work was done.
- Senator Voorhees, of Indiana, laughs at
the statement of Mr. Hale and other Re
publican Senators to the effect that they
hope the Democrats will secure control of
the Senato, and that the Kepublicans will
nut nothtng in their way. The report ho
characterizes as absurd. "The idea that
the Kepublicans will stand back aud give
in an inch," said the Senator, "is as ridicu
lous as the story that the Democrats are
afraid to meet the issue and organize the
Senate. Both of them are too absurd to re
ceive a moment's thought"
Mr. Voorhees says that instead of fearing
to assume the responsibility the Democrats
will take every precaution to secure the
grip they now have on that body. When
asked if a special effort was to be made to
watch the close States where the election
of Senators was a matter of doubt, Mr.
Voorhees said the interests of the party
would be watched wherever it had inter
ests, and that included the States in which
the Kepublicans are trying to steal the
Senators, The statement that tho Demo
cratic party is afraid to undertake the re
vision of the tariff, Mr. Voorhees pro
nounces as an insult to the intelligence of
the men who compose that party. "There
never were truer words spoken," he said,
"than thoso used in the Democratio plat
form to characterize the Republican party
policy. We have denounced it In our
platform aa a robbery and a fraud, and
preached it from every stump in the
country. The Senate is just as enthusiastic
in the matt.r of the coming revision of the
tariff aa the House can possibly be. aud is
perhaps more set in its purpose. We will
assume all responsibility, and aro ready to
begin to-mcrrow if need be. All the in
telligence and wisdom of the country is
not in the Republican party, and when
that party dies all wisdom will not die.
nor will all wisdom have departed when
its majority has departed from the Senate.
The Democratio party can bo de
pended upon to do two things
remove the unjust burdens of tax
ation from the necessaries of life and
provide the necessary revenues for tbe gov
ernment The Republicans are prone to
talk of our mistakes. We may have made
mistakes, but their's have been crimes. If
we were tyros in the science of government
we could not do worse than they; but we
will give the people relief from the burdens
with which they have been oppressed since
the Republicans came into power. The
vote of the people at the recent election
shows wherein they put their confidence,
and that confidence will not be misplaced."
TELLER'S SlLVF.n VIKWS.
The Senator Is Opposed to the Repeal of
the Sherman Acr.
Washington, Dec. 10. Senator Teller,
who la one of the' warmest champions of
silver, is very decidedly opposed to the re
peal of the Sherman silver law; and looks
upon the bill introduced by Mr.
Hill as a menace to the white
metal. "I am opposed to " any inter
ference with the Sherman act," eaid
Mr. Teller, "lor any repeal of that law
means the farther depreciation of silver.
Of course the law is not what it ought to
be, and we have always looked on it aa a
temporary expedient, but it af Fords some
relief. Until something better and more
permanent is given us the silver men
would naturally be opposed to its repeat
The Hill bill or any similar measure would
depreciate silver even lower than it now
is, and increase the evil instead of remedy
ing it."
Mr. Teller thinks tbero will be no at
tempt at silver legislation at this session,
certainly not until after tho Brussels con
ference has reached some conclusion. "If
that conference." continued Mr. Teller,
"does not do anything looking to relief,'
then we must do it 1 am hopeful, how
ever, that tbe conference will accomplish
something, although it seems probable that
it will adjourn over till spring."
. Referring to the President's message. Mr.
Teller said he conld not understand what
the President meant by saying we could
meet the European demand for our gold by
legislation. "We are the debtor nation,''
observed the Senator, "and cannot dictate
terms, much less legislate to suit our
selves in the matter. We owe several
hundred millions to Europe, and
our securities are gilt-edged. W hen they
become due and are dumped upon ns, wo
have no choice but to pay them, and pay
them in gold. too. Europe has two ways of
getting our gold; the one is by securing the
balance of trade and the other by demand
ing the payment of our bonds and obliga
tions as they fall due. If we have unfavor
able legislation on the tariff that permits
the unloading of vast amounts of
imports this balance of trade may
go to Europe. 1 sincerely trust thut
this will not be the case, but the
incoming Democratic Congress has its own
ideas about this matter and they may re
vise the tarifl so that we will tind before us
a condition we have not experienced for
years the balance of trade on tbe other
side of the ledger and the constitutional
demana of English tradesmen for gold in
payment for commercial debts largely
overbalancing our exports."
Tbe remedy from this condition, which
Mr. Teller thinks may. under certain con
ditions arise, he finds in the broader use of
silver for monetary purposes. "If we could
secure th universal increased use of nilver
as money we conld decrease the demand
for gold." said Mr. Teller, "And this is what
we ought to have. An enlarged use of
liver theoretically increases the volume of
gold, and would make tbe demand for that I

Special to the Indianapolis JoarnsX
Washington, Dec. 10. Information re-
ceived here to-day from Montana indicates
that Chairman T. II. Carter, of the Repub
lican national committee, will be elected
to the United States Senate to succeed
Senator Sanders. The latter is quoted as
having 6aid this week in a private conver
sation , that he. himself would assist
Mr. Carter' in the latter's election if
it -appeared that the -frill strength
of the Republican membership of the
Legislature could be thrown to the chair,
man. Senator Sanders finds opposition
to his own election within the lines of the
party, and is not a candidate. Carter is not
only popular in his own party, but has
friends among the Independents and Dem
ocrats, who, it is said, might help in certain
contingencies. The indications are now
that the Democrats will not be able tore
organize the United States Senate after the

Special to the Indianapolis Journal. f
Washington, Dec. 10. Talk of opposi
tion to the re-election of Mr. Crisp to the
speakership does not seem to grow, and the
idea that another man would rule the
House is not received with that enthusiasm
expected by its most ardent advocates,
even a large number of those known to be
unfriendly to the interests of the Speaker
refusing to take part in the hoped-for move
ment. Mr. Crisp is not losing any sleep
over the matter, and his friends laughingly
point to the fact that of the three members
nioft active in the opposition not one has
served in a previous Congress, whilo two of
mem will not be members of the next
House, in which they expect to wage the
speakership tight Mr. Breckinridge, of
Kentucky, and Mr. Wilson, of West Vir
ginia, are the two most formidable rivals of
Mr. Crisp, but it is believed that Mr. Wil
son lends no sanction to the use of his
name in this connection, while Mr. Breck
inridge is saying nothing.

regard to the canal: "The world is calling

of the canal retards tho progress of the

blanket nd taken home. To-night her
condition is considered critical. The boys
or young men who were with the party of

" McAollne Spars with Myer.
Special to the IndlanapoHs Journal. -
Chicago, Deo. 10. Jack McAulifTe and
Billy.Myer came to-gether for a six-round
exhibition to-night at the Second Regi
ment Armory, on Michigan avenue. Five
thousand people were in attendance, and
yelled themselves hoarse over the lively
sparring match. Several three-round con
tests took place before the event of the
evening. - An unknown from Cincinnati,
who! had 'overloaded bis system with red
liquor, created vast amusement for the
crown by his attempt to box Bob Costello.
McAulifle olimbea through the ropes at
10:30and Myer cauio a few minutes later.
No attempt was made to hold a slugging
match, and the men banged away at each
other with soft boxing gloves. The second
rounds was called far ahead of time and
the -, crowd was very demonstrative
in; its disapproval. Neither man made
anyf - special etiort in tbe first
round' and neither was given an
opportunity in the second. In the third,
however, they started in for business and
banged each other viciously. This was de
cidedly Myers round. The fourth was
somewhat in favor of McAulifTe, who forced
his antagonist to the ropes and got in sev
eral hard blows on the stomach. The last
rounds were uneventful, and neither man
was any the worse for wear when time was
called tbe last time. MoAn litre left for
Indianapolis to-night, where he begins an
engagement Monday.
