Emigration front ticorgln.
That the colored people ia a few of the
Southern States are restive under the severe
disabilities forced upon then) by tho whites
of those States is an indisputable fact. It is
a fact that the African Colonization Society
avails themselves of in their continued efforts
to remove the colored people from this country
to the death-dealing shores of Africa.
While the colored people are contemplating
emigration from the South for the purpose of
bettering their condition, they should weigh
carefully all plans and propositions as to the
? place of going. Colored people born in this
country are no more able to undergo the
fevers of Africa than white people born here,
and the fact of their inability to make headway
against the oppression of the South is no
more an argument wW they should return
to the land of their fathers than' a
"V'i>? foMtint nmnv German
reprosruuuun w? ??? ??v? or
Irish in New York who find it ft difficult
matter to make headway against the high
cost of living in that city would be an argument
that they should return to the land of
their fathers.
Statesmen and friends of the latter rac*s
urge emigration to the fertile fields of the
West, where cheap lands nud good climate
await the earnest toil of enterprising laborers
to return wealth and plenty. We say to
the colored people of the South, though you
may be able to obtain employment at home,
the time seems to be fir distant when you
can become owners of the soil and consequently
independent of the will of land
owners. Until you are independent of those
who own the land and who can dictate the
terms upon which you will be employed, you
will be' but little better than slaves. The
people of color in the State of Georgia are already
arousing themselves to the importance
of looking elsewhere for that independence
which alono can make them something more
than subjects of a few landlords.
With the colored people of Georgia it ii
something more than becoming property
holders that they seek. They seek a plact
where there children can be educated unmo
lested, where they can be safe in religiou:
uevouous. jnaii) uigc cuiiijiiinuu iv tu<
Western and Southwestcrn_Territories
others feel that some of the Southern Statei
in which unappropriated public lands are t<
be found and where the spirit of intolcranci
of colored men is not rampant, is more de
sizable.
Our attention has been called to the Stab
of Arkansas as furnishing allurements in thi
way of good and cheap land with fine climab
and a people who are not so deeply dyei
with the spirit of negro hate as are the peopl
of other Southern States.
We take the following in relation to Ar
kansas from a pamphlet by James P. Ilenry
AGRICULTURAL RESOURCES.
There is probably no State in the Ameri
can Union that enjoys greater natural ad
antages for the production of as great a va
riety of the fruits of the earth as Arkansas
Situated in the most favored parallels of th
. temperate zone, with a wide diversity of soils
' and blessed with a climate for the most par
eminently salubrious, it is capable of meetinj
the requirements of every variety of rura
taste and of sustaining a dense population
Thn Hvrieultural nraducLs of Arkansas ar
varied and great, and well adapted to a di
, versified agriculture and the varied employ
' menu of inau. There are millions of acre
of land still unimproved, that ouly await th
hand of the laborer to make them productiv
of immense wealth to the owners and th
country, it must be remembered that tbi
State is so situated that there is, with fe*
exceptions, no product of the soil pertaining
to the temperate or tropical zones, and whici
is of real use to man as food, which canno
. be grown in this State. The evidences c
the accumulation of wealth and the increas
of production in other States of the Union
show unmistakably that those States adapte<
to mixed agriculture and employ the time am
capital of the farmer twelve months in th
year, are the most profitable ones. A farme
can here raise a crop with about ono-hal
the labor and expense that is required in th
north or east. For those desiring a pleas
ant, profitable, and healthful employment ii
the most salubrious of all climates, where h
can labor in the open air every day in th
year, and where be can maintain himself s<
easily with limited means until be can im
? prove bis farm ; when that is done, the re
ward for his labor will be great, and hinase
independent. More money can be mad
farming in Arkansas than in the northwest
First. Because of the greater varietv of crop

miles nearer the great consuming regions c
the South, and the shipping ports for ih
West Indies and Europe. Third. Because ii
& short time a home market, the best of al
markets, will be built up in our midst, b
reason of our great tniueral wealth, capabl
of sustaining an untold number of miners an
manufacturers.
* GOVERNMENT LANDS.
All male persons and unmarried female:
of lawful age, are entitled under the laws t
the Government to a homestead and pre
eruption of land, consisting of one hundre
and sixty acres each, or three hundred an
twenty acres in the aggregate. The home
stead costs nothing, save the fees, atuouul
ing to #16 for 100 acres ; i'J for 80 acres ; <t
for 40 acres; 20 per cent, of the abov
amounts can be reserved until the expiratioi
of five years, at which time the settler get
his patent from the Government; the titl
being perfected by an actual residence of fiv
years upon the land. The pre-emption t
one hundred and sixty acres costs #1.25 P?"
acre, and a few dollars more for fee-. Thu
a man can secure his homestead of 100 acre
at a cost of 818, and then lie has the privi
lege of entering 1G0 more, and the whole 32
acres will cost him only some #250. This i
extremely liberal on the part of the Govern
went, and is all that can be desired on th
I part of the bettler. It must be remembere*
I that the land thus secured in Arkanoss, is a
I fine as any m the world for the production ?j
grain, fruits, vegetable?, or stock raising.
Persons desiring to get Government land
I should select their locality, go to the distric
I land office and get plats made of a few town
I ships, then with these go out and get sonv
settler to help you look out a piece to sui
I you; you then can go to the office and maki
I yotir entry, after which, if a homestead, yoi
I are allowed six months in wLich to establisl
your home upon the land, and no one can in
I terfere with your entry during that time.
I There are four Government land offices ii
I the State, and about eight million acres u
land, situated as follows:
No. 1. Little Bock District, at Little Bock
I Pulaski county, 1,700,000 acres.
So. 2. Fayettevilie District, at Harrison
P^ Boone county, 1,860,000 acres.
No. 3. Clarkesville District, at Dardanelle
in Tell county, 1,860,000 acres.
No. 4. Washita District, at Camden
Ouachita county, 2,600,000 acres.
I We publish these extracts for the benefi
of thoss who coutemplate flatting out for i
I larger independence aad who have the enter

The People** Appreciation ofTrnc :'
Merit. '
The manifestations of sorrow and regret (
about the death of Horace Greeley, so uni- (
vcreal, so sincere, reflect not less favorably ,
ou those from whom they emanate, than on
the man who has been their object. It is
frequently asserted by other nations that the (
Americans are emphatically devoted to the (
pursuit of material interests, and lack the ;
nerceDtion and annreciation of the highest
intellectual and moral qualities. The hom- j,
ago paid to the memory of Horace Greeley I (
strikingly refutes this assertion, since it is j (
solely a tribute to intellectual achievements ; (
and to personal moral worth. If Mr. Greo-; (
ley had occupied any high and important otli- ,
cial position, a large part of these demon* ]
strations might bo accounted for on that i
ground, but it was?we should say?his good j
luck never to be before the people in any of- (
ticial capacity of consequence, though he was ,
more than once an aspirant for it. The Prcsi-! i
dencv, the dream of his life, was denied to 1
him; lie neither was a member of the Cabinet
nor was he ever prominent in Congress; ,
he was none of those favored few, who j
through one great discovery become material i
benefactors of mankind, and thus win ever- i
lnstiug fame. In fact, thero was not one j
single inducement of that description to en- j
list the sympathy of the whole natiou ; it w as |
simply Horace Greeley to whom the people
thus paid their tribute of recognition, of rev-!
erence and gratitude; the founder and chifcf
editor of the New York Tribune, the life-long
advocate of liberty, justice, and human rights,
the philanthropist, the promoter of enlightenment,
progress, and science, and the irrecon.
cilable enemy of oppression, bigotry, and .
vice, who has wielded as nowerful an intlu
encc, contributed as much to the intellectual, ;
political, aud moral improvement of his coun- |
trymen as any other man living. It is true
that a large part of those most anxious to express
their feelings of reverence and regret !
arc by no means possessed of the degree of;
knowledge, depth, and intelligence needed to
appreciate and sound Horace Greeley's manifold
merits by themselves ; that with them it
is a matter of feeling, of instinct, or an impression
based on the authority of others,
rather than the result of independent and intelligent
judgment. This circumstance, however,
far from lessening the value of their
sympathy, only shows their disposition, their
tendency to venerate all that is noble and
good in a man, though it may even exceed
their power of comprehension.
There is another significant feature about
the honors showered on Mr. Greeley. It
must be remembered that just a short time
previous to his death, he had alienated the
affection of a largo part of the very best men
in the country, who, if he had lived, would
never have forgiven him his attempt to help
the Democrats into power; yet this most fa>
tal mistake of his life is now passed over in
2 silence, owing to the magnanimous disposi
tion of mankind to forget the errors of a great
man, and to remember only his merits and
5 virtues, when they so much outweigh the
8 former. If Mr. Greoley could have seen and
8 heard all the manifestations of affection and
* reverence of nearly a whole nation, he would
8 have become reconciled to his failure as a
candidate for tho Presidency, and discovered
* how far more honorable, exalted, and desir:
able was the position of Horace Greeley of
the Tribune than that of a Democratic Prcsident
of the United States. Even if he had
been successful, his course would necessarily
i. have gone downward, since he would have
e been left with comparatively little power for
' good in the hands of a worthless party, under
1? whose weight even his popularity must have
il broken down, which ,now is safe forever in
' the memory of this generation as in those
e that ore to succeed it.
i- _
s Where are the Civil Service
o Schoolmasters I
e Our readers hardly need be told that we
s have very little faith in the Civil Service
r Board as a reformatory institution, and that
j[ we believe that it has and must continue utt
terly to fail to improve the civil service of the
if country. This distrust of the merits of the
e competitive system for ascertaining the litj
ness of applicants for public positions, is
j based on common sense and those principles
e wnicn experience nas snown 10 ue necessary
r to success in all business operations. But
there is work for which the "schoolmasters"
who are said to compose the board ought to
n be peculiarly fitted and in which they could
e be of some practical use to the civil service.
e A sense of public duty, imposed by our
position, has led us to an occasional exam.
ination of the annual reports of Heads of
f Bureaus, as well as the President's Message
e and the reports of the various Secretaries,
g The result of this examination has been to
d force upon us the inquiry at the head of this
if article, "Where are the Civil Service Schoole
masters ?" and prompted us to suggest tlmt
H they be assigned the special duty of putting
y inMfclecent and intelligible English the lane
guagc of these reports. In many of them the
d most glaring contempt for all the rules of
grammar is exhibited, often obscuring the
. meaning, or rendering it ridiculous. And
>f then there is a tautology, or repetition of
words, that is extremely disagreeable to
d lovers of pure English. We will illustrate
^ our meaning by quoting a few lines from the
eiav\;iucui9 ui ouiuu Ui iuc V/Uici9 Ul 1/1V1SIUU3
7 to the Third Auditor?these statements bee
iug embodied by him in his report to the
u Secretary of the Treasury, iu the language,
e , we suppose, in which they were written. For
e ; instance, the bookkeeper says :
"The average number of clerks engaged
r in this division during the period embraced
* in this report has been nine, and that num?
ber now constitutes the active force of the
t* division."
To have informed the Auditor that the average
number &c., in th% division is nine,
e * * and that number now constitutes
d it* force, would have improved the language
* and saved " vain repetitions" in our opinion.
But this is far more tolerable than the attempt
of the Chief of the Quartermaster's Dit
vision to inform the Auditor what its duties
* are. He says:
! "The accounts of ouariermasters cover a
' wide and varied range of disbursements and
property accountability, embracing disbursements
for barracks, quarters, hospitals, storebouses,
offices, stables, forage and transport- ;
ation of all army supplies, army clothing, 1
^ camp and garrison equipage, the purchase of j
f cavalry and artillery horses, fuel, forage,!
straw,'material for bedding, stationery; hired
uien; per diem to extra duty men; of the
* pursuit and apprehension of deserters; of the
burial of offictrs and soldiers; of hired es*
corts; of expresses, interpreters, spies, and
Sides; of veterinary surgeons and medicines
: hones; of," &c.
f If the chief had avoided repeating "disbursements,"
and simply said tha duties of
t his division cover disbursements * *
i fvr barracks, &c., the Auditor and the coun
try would have understood him quite as welL
f The civil service schoolmaster would probably
have suggested this omission, and they
THE 3STI
vould Lave bccu very likely, also, to have
laved him the absurdity of saying, as he
Iocs, that one of the duties of his division Is
he "purchase" of "hired men,''' the "purchase"
of per diem to extra duty men, &C.
S'or would they have permitted so
clumsy, confused, and contradictory an explanation
as the chief makes of the reason for
ho large increase of accounts and returns
his year over last without a corresponding
ncrease in the amounts involved, to go into
i grave public document. We pass over
cveral other incongruities and errors of this
division and pass to the explanation the Chief
of the Pension Division makes or tries to make
>f the duties of his office. Read this specimen
of the kind of English used by this chief:
The duties devolving upon this division arc
keeping an account with each army pcusioner,
recording the name, rate, date of commencement,
noting every iucrease, reduction, transfer,
re-marriage, death and expiration, whether
by limitation under existing laws or on
account of the disability having ceased. Also,
keeping an account with each pension
agent, (of whom there are 59,) charging him
with all moneys advanced by the Government,
under the several appropriations to pav
pensious, receive and register the accounts
as sent each month direct to this office, b\
the agents who have disbursed the money
and properly file them for settlement.
If the chief had not forgotten to tell the
Auditor what ho means b}' "date of com
mencemcnt1' and "oxpiratian," or the "ex
piration" of w hat he refers to, it would hav?
been more satisfactory to those whose inter
est it is to read the report. And the Euglisl
of the statement is not improved by its sud
den tr.-.nsition from the present participle b
the present verb, the indiscriminate use c
each in the same sentence, w hen only one o
the other can be correctly used, the use c
the present for the past tense, dintt insteai
of directly, and similar errors. The wliol
statement abounds in this kind of bungling
may, might, and shall being considered inter
changeable terms, sentences left unfinished
adjectives substituted for adverbs, and othe
barbarous outrages upon our mother tongue
We presume it is the usual custom of th
chief clerk to translate these statements int
respectable English. But as he may not al
ways be able to do so on account of absence
sickness, or other pressing engagements, w
trust the President will assign to the Civ
Service Board that duty. Tho credit of th
Government, as well as the particular de
partment from which these reports emanate
are involved in this matter; and it become
him to see that the public service shall no
be disgraced by theso annual exhibitions c
carelessness or ignorance. The mission <
the gentlemen whose contributions to 01
official literature wo have criticised, ev
dently is not writing the English language
Tlicy are quite likely faithful and efficier
clerks in certain positions, but decidedly nc
at home in the line of English compositior
It is not intended, we beg the gentleme
whose "compositions" we have noticed to hi
lieve, to single them out as sinners above a
others. But this report happened to bo th
first to attract our attention, and we thougl
it would do for a text for what we desired t
say in regard to an evil which tho Civ
service Board ought to be able to correct ?
well as any other, and present as favorab!
opportunity to suggest to the President ho
he can turn it into some practical accoun
As opportunity and occasion occurs, we ma
pay our respects to other delinquents of tt
same kind. In the meantime, perhaps,
will be well for the Chiefs and those whos
compositions enter into and make up the;
bureau reports, to turn their attention to tl
study of English grammar against a timo
need.
Our System or l'ubllc Works, an
What lias Been Done.
There is, probably, no city in the world i
which such wonderful changes have bee
wrought during a single year as have take
place in Washington within that period, i
there is probably nunc in which a more mai
nificcnt system of public improvements e:
ists tlian that extablished, aud so energet
cally carried forward by our Board of Publ
Works. As our readers know we have give
no fulsome support to tho board, and indet
that we have been rather a silent observi
ol their action than their interested chanipioi
But a caiefu! perusal of their annual repo
and a personal observation of their open
tious during the past season, has satisfied i
that they have not only faithfully consulte
the best interests of the city, but have rei
dered and are still rendering our citizcr
benefits and blessings worth vastly more tha
they have cost, and, therefore, that they at
entitled to something more than silent ai
quiescence in their efforts to make Washinj
ton an honor rather than a disgrace to tl
nation, as it so long has been. We propos
to show, as briefly as possible, why we thin
the Hoard of l'ublic Works deserve the can
est, active support of the people of the cit;
and the earnest, active, practical support i
Congress.
Our readers arc aware that almost froi
the day the Board of Public Works was o
ganized, they have had to encounter all po
! sible obstacles on the part of a discontentc
faction of our citizens through the courts ar
from certain members of Congress. Injun*
tions have been repeatedly served upon then
Congressional investigations had, and vnrioi
other difliculties interposed. The moti\
for which these annoying proceedings wei
commenced?which was absolutely to stc
all improvements by the board?failed, it
true. But it greatly delayed their work, ii
volvcd it in a large expense, and bad a
injurious effect upon their plans generally.
Yet they are not satisfied. Mr. Itoos
velt, a bogus New York "reformer," wl
had the fortune to be elected to Congress f
a single term, and then to be laid on tl
shelf, and who has a personal grievance i
avenge on the board because he could m
| fasten one of his worthless Tammany d*
pendents upon them as a sinecurist, hi
renewed the war and succeeded in inducic
Congress to order another investigation lnl
their proceedings. The pretense that regai
I for the public good, or the welfare of the cit;
has anything to do with this movement,
a gross fraud. Every other active enemy i
i the board has, like Itoosevelt, some persons
; grievance against them?he has failed to g<
; a fat contract, to black-mail the board, I
get a comfortable birth for himself or h
friends. This new investigation, followir
so close upon the heels of the long, searcl
ing, and embarrassing one of the last se
sion, is, of course, wholly unnecessary. J
will delay work, however, cause considerab
expense, and annoy and embarrass tt
board. That is all its authors hope to a
compiisb.
But we are losing sight of our main pu
pose, which is to show why the Board <
Public Works is entitled to our active su]
port, the confidence of the people, and tt
co-operation and aid of Congress. From tl
report of the board to the President, jui
published, wc select such facts as bear upo
:W NATIQNA
| this poiut which will sustain us in the course tr
| we have decided to take, and justify the
I statement we made at the beginning that (j
there is no city in the world that has done so jj
much in a single year to improve its streets, c;
parks, squares, reservations, fountains, &c.,
and at so small a relative cost. 81
Within the last year the Board of Public a
: Works have laid seventy miles of sewerage, n
j eight of which belong to the main system, s
j and consist of brick sewers of from four to I
J thirty feet in the span. The great Tiber '
I sewer, which drains the northeastern portion <I
-< .1-- , , II
Ul U1C CIIV ? is ^,4, J icei auu ?uu?j *~w. .
| span ; the Slash-Run sewer, which drains the j *
northwestern portion of the city, is 2,200 feet j ^
long, and wide enough to drive a horse and j
buggy through, while the great B-street in-' *
tcrcepting sewer, which drains the central L
[ portion of the city, and takes the place of the '
, old canal, is twolvc feet wide and one tnile j1
i long. The old canal, so long the standing 1
disgrace of the city, is no longer in existence. j'
1 Its banks are full of good solid earth, and the
. ground reclaimed by it i9 worth half a million I
r of dollars, which i3 coolly appropriated by the | J
i I general Government because Congress appro- j
i priated $03,000 toward tilling up the ditch. !:
' | A pretty good speculation. The two first-j
) I named scuerrnrc not yet complete, and will I
be extended to about twice their present |1
length. I!
As every citizen of Washington has the
best reason to know, the plan of the city, as 1
laid out by its founders, is on the most mag- j
niOcent scale, contemplating a very large j
3 population. The avenues, streets, and allies
P of the city occupy or take up more than half:
the area of the city; that is, there is more j
j. ground in our avenues, streets, and allies ;
j than there is devoted to public grounds and
0 public and private buildings. As to the best
plan to improve the wide thoroughfares, intersperscd
with numerous reservations and
1 public squares, without bankrupting the peo^
pie, was a difficult question to solve. In re- j
gard to it the board say in their report:
44 The most feasible plan suggested was so j
e to narrow the carriage-ways as to render the
o use of improved pavements practicable. This
1- would place the surplus width inside the foot,
walks, where it could be parked and othcr''
wise beautified at slight expense to the pub0
lie, and in many instances at the expense of
il the property bordering upon it, the owners of
e which lor the privilege of the use of the j
ground would gladly beautify and adorn it.
By this plan, that which was a barren and '
unsightly waste has been made a beautiful i
lS feature in the contour of the streets and ave>t
nucs. The cost has thus been very largely
reduced, while the capacity of the streets, as
j. a means of intercourse, has not been in the
least abridged."
!r Xext to this question, so wisely solved by
the board, as well in expense as annoyance,
" was that of grades. The system they adopt
j e(i guariiinct'u wiu iuujh ucienmucu vjjjiuoi- j
)l | tion, at first, as west of the War and Navy
' Departments where several of the streets were
11 cut from four to eight feet. But the board
"" went straight on, and finally secured the ap- j
11 proval of tho very men at first most bitterly
ie opposed to these radical measures. All ad-!
mit that the new grade has greatly improved |
0 and beautified the streets in those portions of j
tho city where they have been completed.
13 The following statement, showing seventy
miles of pavement and forty-seven miles of
w other carriage-way constructed by the board
since they commenced operations, will exhibit
v at a glance the vast extent of their work, and
'c givo the leader at a distance an idea of the
11 wonderful changes it must have made in the
!e character and appearance of our streets:
'c 34.2G miles of treated wood pavements.
10 5.05 miles of round block pavements,
of 0.87 miles of compound wood and concrete j
pavement.
1C.30 miles of concreto pavement.
4.01 miles of Belgian and granite pave- j
?l ments.
8.08 miles of Macadamized street.
C.TG miles of cobblestone pavement,
in 39.22 miles of graveled streets and roads,
,n mostly in county.
in 115.3G miles of improved carriage-way pave18
ments, assuming the same as 32 feet
g- wide.
?- Most of these pavements are of the latest
i- and most improved patents, while a few may
ic be worthless and have to be relaid or repaired
n i at an early day. There is one good feature, j
d I however. All contractors are required to I
:r J give bonds to keep their pavements in order j
i. j for three years. The Macadam road has }
rt j been rejected for city use, owing to the dust I
l- | arising from it, but it is well adapted to the ;
is roads of the county, where it has been ex- j
sd tensively used.
l- In addition to the street pavements, there ,
is have been laid ninety miles of briek and three
,n miles of concrete foot-pavements.
:e But we are exteuding this article beyond i
c- the limits we designed, or can well devote to j
j- it. But the subject is one of such vast im- J
le portance to every citizen of Washington, as |
se it ought to be to every American citizen, that j
ik we think it worth the space we have given j
i- it, and, indeed, to much more. But we must j
p, content ourselves with a simple statement of j
of the financial condition of the board and the 1
cost of the work done. The board have ex- i
m pended for this work, or incurred liabilities ;
r- for it amounting to 87,030,212, and have re- j
s- sources amounting to 87,248,405, leaving a j
id balance unexpended of 8102,253. Oftho sum j
id expended the board claim that Congress
c- should pay $1,240,920, as its proportion of j
a, the expense. As to the cost of the work the j
is Washington correspondent of the Xow York !
re Times says :
re It is the remark of every one who becomes
)D cognizant of the amount of work performed
. that it seems impossible that it should have
iS been done for the sum it has actually cost.
And it is a fact that the Board of Public j
in Works of the District of Columbia have succeeded
in getting the work done for from fif-1
teen to thirty per cent, less than in other ;
p* cities, and fully fifty per sent, less than the j
10 same work is done for in the cities of New
or York and Brooklyn. The identical pave-'
le ments which have cost New York five dollars '
. per square yard are being laid here for three ,
dollars and three dollars and fifty cents. |
This is one of the points which will espce
cially bear scrutiny. This result has been
i8 achieved by a determination on the part of
the board at the outset, that it would be bet- ]
g ter to establish a scale of prices at which work i
t0 should be done, and to award contracts at
:d three uniform prices to responsible persons,
v. The plan has worked exceedingly well.
: Money has been paid only for work actually
done; the persons employed have no interest
in defrauding the board, and have secured a
al fair equivalent for services rendered. The
et report says :
[0 "The board point with pride to the work
done and the prices paid, and arc satisfied
18 that no one investigating the subject hon'g
estly and impartially will fail to acknowledge
i- that in no instance on record has so much
8. been accomplished in so short a period of
time and at a cost so reasonable."
And this Is another evidence of the fact
'e that the present form of government of the
te District, even if it be not the best that can
c. be devised, has, at least so far as the Board
of Public Works are concerned, demonstrated
that it is possible to prosecute m:eat public
r" en'erprises without the taint or corruption,
of No single charge of this chamcter brought
p. against the board has effected a lodgment,
te even after nearly five moaths of searching
investigation. There are many who think
ie that the local Legislature is a machine both j
it unnecessary and extravagant, and their obn

light be effected by the abolition of this I
ody, Congress and the Governor or Presi- j
ent assuming its powers. If corruption is (;
able to concentrate anywhere in the gov-1 ^
rnment of this District, it is here.
In concluding their report the board pre-j ?
ent some very instructive figures as to the ! .
mount expended bv the General Govern-1 ,
lent on the streets and avenues of the city j(
ince 1862. The account runs thus:
ly the General Government . .$1,321,288 31 j

)r for ten per Cent, by the General Govern-! '
,onf tuintv nnr <-ont. he the citv : and i i '
he amount paid by Georgetown and the *
ounty be added, it will make about two mil- ?
ions more. In view of these facts it is urged j1
hat an appropriation be made at an early '
lay to reimburse the District for the amount j 1
sxpended in the improvements of Govern- j1
nent property. j1
We think this statement of facts will vin- > j
licato the action of the Board of Public j
[Vorks and reconcile the people of Washingion
to tlio burden necessarily imposed upon j
hem. Every dollar expended has added j
lliroe to the value of the property of our citi- |
tens. But it has done much more than that,
[t has shown the people of the nation that
we are willing to help ourselves, before
askipg help from Congress, and to a much
greater extent. All we ask of Congress is
to contribute a small amount toward improvements
from which the Government derives
such vast advantage. The Government owns
nearlv half the properiy of the city. But it
is asked to pay less than a quarter of the expense.
Will it not do this naked act of justice
?
Where the Trouble I.lcs.
It is doubtful if any one of the native chivalry
of Virginia has done so much to prevent
immigration to thatState and to drive Northern
men from it who have settled there, as
the carpet-hag Governor Walker. He has
out-IIeroded the most ferocious of the F. F.
V's in his proscription of every emigrant
who declined to become a mean and subservient
tool of the old slave-holding aristoc- j
racy of the State. But he sometimes preach-1
os better than ho practices, and we see j
uv iill" ->i'\> iuik limes null tie ims rcccuu^
been (diking something like common sense
upon this subject of immigration. In referring
to this gleam of political sanity, the
Times says:
"It is so seldom we can tind occasion to
commend anything said or done by Governor
Walker, of Virginia, that we are the more
ready to indorse the sensible views he lately
expressed in a public meeting upon the need
of immigration to that State. His idea that
an official volume should be published by the
State, giving full and accurate information
of her resources and advantagesTis one deserving
encouragement, and we hope to see
it carried into practical effect."
Walker might publish a thousand "official
volumes" upon the resources and advantages
of the State, and talk himself blind in his
appeals for immigration without effect while
the people of Virginia continue to insult and
ostracise every man from the North, as they
have done since the close of the rebellion as
well as before its beginning. No man who
possesses the slightest self-respect and manly
independence will select for his home a State
where he is held in contempt by the people,
treated as a social out-cast, and his life often
endangered by every attempt he may mnke
to vindicate his right to the political and
civil privileges of a freeman.
When the people of Virginia learn to treat
immigrants from the North as well as from
other portions of the globe, we will not say
with "generous confidence," but with ordinary
justice and civility, and a disposition is
shown to make a life among them tolerable,
then the natural advantages of the State will
undoubtedly begin to attract a respectable
and valuable class of emigrants to their
State, and not till then; nor until then will
they secure a class who will be worth having.
The men who will meekly submit to the annoyance,
insult, ostracism, and oppression
of his neighbors will be no benefit to any
State. Govc-nor Walker'sfirststepsliouldbe,
if he desire to entice settlers to "Virginia, to
correct public sentiment at home rather than
publishing books to show the people abroad
what its resources and advantages are.
Did Con. ItanliM Reitlgnf
The Chronicle, in its amiable desire to
palliate the offenses of the Liberal bolters and
save their tender sensibilities, persists in the
erroneous statement that Gen. Banks tendered
his resignation to the House as chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Relations, !
and that tho House refused to accept that resignation.
Gen. Banks did not tender his |
resignation, and, of course, the House did not j
refuse to accept it. What he did do was to |
ask the House to excuse him from serving on |
the committee in any capacity, and the request
was refused. If he had resigned the
chairmanship in plain, frank terms, we have
reason to believe it would have boen ae- j
cepted. Perhaps those disposed to quabble
about this matter will say that his request I
was equivalent to n resignation. But mem- j
bers of Congress and tbe Chronicle know bet- j
ter. If Gen. Banks doubts it let him resign j
without anvcircumlocution, and thus test the I
real sentiment of the Ilouse.
We hope the vote of the Republicon members
of the Ilouse against excusing Gen.
Banks from serving on the Committee of
Foreign Affairs tvas not intended as a disposition
to palliate political apostacy. If Banks
had been successful in his efforts to defeat
the Republican party, not Mr. Greeley, the
Liberal Republican, but some Copperhead
rebel sympathizer, or active robel would be
the President elect, and the Government
restored to the hands of those who shed so
much blood to destroy it. How long will a j
party remain in power if 6uch infidelity as :
Banks, Blair, Farnsworth, &c., displayed, is j
not only winked at but practically approved ?
The Senate has set the House a good ex-:
ample as .to the disposition to be made of \
traitors.

House Committee on the District of Columbia,
A. It. Shepherd, Esq., member of the |
Board of Public Works, literally squelched
the bogus reformer Roosevelt who has undertaken
to prevent the further prosecution
of our magnificent system of public works.
It only took ten minutes to dispose of this
champion of the enemies of city improvements,
and he started off for New York, on
the head of it, probably to take another lesson
in Tammany tactics.
The nouse has passed a bill abolishing
the office of United States Internal Revenue '
Assessor and Assistant Assessors. The
abolishing of these offices will make a saving
yearly of about 91,700,000. Tbis prompt ac- j
tion on the part of the House indicates n
spirit of economy which will meet the earnest j
approval of the people.

Civil Rlftlitn.
The cases recently decided in the Police ,
iourt against certain restaurant-keepers in ,
Vashington for reftising accommodation to ,
persona on account of race or color, having j
?een appealed, came up for trial in the Crimnal
Court last week. Unfortunately the ,
Irawing up of the indictments or informa- j
ions l ad been intrusted toone who evidently
las not had much experience in preparing ,
iueh forms. As a consequence of this each
nformation was quashed, and the merits of
he cases were left untouched. William A.
Jook, Esq., evinced an earnestness for which
ill lovers of justice can hut commend him, 1
md, but for the unfortunate mistakes of his I
issistant in drawing the papers, would have I
pushed tlio cases to a final decision. The j
merits of the law have not been decided, as
alleged by the Sunday organ of proscription,
and we hope soon to have a case that quibbles
cannot afl'ect.
Our Oeleriite at Work.
Mr. Chipman, delegate for the District of
Columbia in the House of Representatives, !
is urging upon Congress the justice of giving
the District of Columbia a share in the public
lands for school purposes. We would j
like bis efforts in relation to colored schools j
much better were they tending to their abo- j
lition and tho doing awav of distinctions on
account of color in public common schools.
If we must have colored schools we demand
that they shall be under the supervision of1
colored persons. If the schools are to be j
placed under one board of commissioners or j
trustees, and white teachers are to placed
in charge of clored schoolso, why not colored
teachers tako charge of white schools ? We
can see no difference between an educated
and competent white teacher and an educated,
competent colored teacher. In our opinion
discriminations on account of race and
color, have no foundation in reason, and we
would like to see measures proposed to do j
away with them.
Louisiana.
We are pleased with the turn affairs have
taken in Louisiana. The Republican party
are now in a position to defend themselves
against the tyranny of Governor Warmoth.
Our friend, Lieutenant Governor Pinchhack,
has been installed as Governor of Louisiana
pending the impeachment of Warmoth ; an
account of which will be found elsewhere.
Tlie Supplementary Civil ItlglilM
Bill.
In the House of Representatives, Monday,
Mr. Frye's Civil Rights Bill came up for
consideration, and was referred to the Committee
on the Revision of the Laws. There
is no reason why this measure should not
receive prompt attention and speedy passage.
Now is the time to make good the
professions of the Republican party and to
accede to the demands of the people that
complete liberty and exact equality take the
place of the oppression under which colored
people labor.
The Philadelphia Prtss and the Republican
papers which opposed Hartranft's election as
Governor of Pennsylvania, made Senator
Cameron the issue, and really fought the
battle against him. As our readers know,
they were defeated by a majority of over
thirty-five thousand, and Gen. Cameron emphatically
sustained. But that does not seem
to reconcile them to the General, and so they
continue the war against him almost as
fiercely as ever. It is said that even fools
will learn something in the school of adversity,
but Gon. Cameron's enemies do not.
Justice Nelson, of the United States Supreme
Court, has resigned his seat on the
bench on account of old age, and the President
has appointed Hon. Ward Hunt, of
Utica, N. Y., to the vacancy. Mr. Hunt is
said, by those who know him best, to be a
ripe scholar, an able lawer, and a gentleman
of the highest character and strictest integrity.
The appointment is believed to be an
admirable one.

The Galaxy.
The Galaxy has now entered on the eighth
year of its existence, under circumstances of
unusual prosperity.
This magazine has from the drst occupied
a field entirely its own. The aim of the
Galaxy has been to discuss promptly every
great subject which is uppermost in the public
mind, and to have the discussion carried
on by our ablest and best-known men in each
department.
Those papers by conspicuous public men,
ou national topics of importance, will be continued,
and will embrace contributions from
the most prominent of our living statesmen
on questions of national interest.
Hon. Gideon Welles will several times appear
as the author of Political Reminiscences
of the highest value and interest.
Mr. J. S. Black and the author of the "Desultory
Sketches" of politicians of note will
both continue to engage the interest of the
readers of the Galaxy.
Also, other articles by our most prominent
statesmen, which the publishers are not yet
at liberty to announce.
A new story, by J. W. De Forest, the author
of "Overland" and "Kate Beaumont,"
called the "Wethorel Affair," will run
through the year 1873.
This serial, the first part of which is given
in the Decembec-number, deals with characters
and surroundings different from those
hitherto treated by Col. De Forest, and it
will command the uninterrupted interest of
the reading public, even more than previous
stories by the same author, who is justly entitled
to the leading place among our Amercan
novelists of to-day.
In the January number will appear the first
instalment of a new story, by Mrs. Annie
Edwards, the author of "Ought We to Visit
Her?" "Seven Lawrence Yeoman," "Archie
Lovell," "Susan Fielding," etc.
This story will be printed in the Galaxy
from advanced MSS. forwarded by Mrs. Edwards,
and will be eagerly welcomed by the
thousands of admirers of the author who has
won a leading place among English novelists.
A new novel, by Mr. Justin McCarthy, the
author of "Lady Judith," ect., will also appear
in the Galaxy during the year 1873. '
* - - ?
A valuable series of papers will bo fur*
lisbed by Carl Benson, under the title of
'Casual Cogitations," and will include the
esults of the wide and varied experience of
rcen and affairs which the author has enjoyed.
Mr. Italian! Grant White, whose contribulions
to the Galaxy have been missed during
the last year, wili resume his discussions of
philological and other subjects in the volume
for 1373.
Mr. Edward Crapsey, whose articles ou
i4 Tl?r? r?f "Wirf r?a-o tv**
for him so desirable a position as a faithful
describer cf low life in the Metropolis, has,
aa tho principal political correspondent of the
New York Times during the Presidential canvass,
enjoyed rare opportunities for studying
the workings of our political machinery, which
he will use in a series of picturesque papers
for the Galaxy, which will well reward the
attention of all readers.
Mr. Junius llenri Browne already favorably
known to the readers of the Galaxy, will
furnish a notable series of papers on Women
in their relations to society ami affairs. Ths
first, which will be published in tho January
number, will be on '' Women as Companions."
Mr. Justin McCarthy, who needs no introduction
to tho friends of the Galaxy, will be
a regular contributor.
Mr. Albert Rhodes, the author of the
Sketches in the Galaxy for the past year on
foreign peoples and their customs, will add to
thocc papers a further series of similar character.
These are a few of the features of the
Galaxy for IS73 of which the publishers can
now make positive announcement. Arrangements
are in progress for other attract- V
ive articles, which will be duly advertised.
"The "Scientific Miscellany" of the
Galaxy has proved so generally popular that
the publishers seek to make it still more de- &
serving of the attention of intelligent readers.
The department is prepared by a distinguished
scientist, whose relations with the leading
scientific men of England, and Eurone cr-n
| erally, are such as to enable the Galaxy to
keep abreast of the latest fact*.
In the department of literary criticism the
; Galaxy will have the a~si?tnnce of some of
the clearest and brightest intellects in the
i country.
The Galaxy gives great . arc to the selection
of short stories from the large number
offered its editor, and makes them a noticeable
feature of each number of the magazine.
The Galaxy i? edited with the nicest possible
appreciation of the public taste, and
. seems fitted to meet the wants of every member
of the family.
For the trifling expense of *4.00 per year
one may obtain in the Galaxy a vast amount
j of instructive and entertaining reading; and,
were this his only source of culture, one could
not fall very far behind the spirit of the age.
A Popular Magazine?-Yen- Plan?is
welcomed to our exchange list. Tt has the
following characteristics:
1. In its large list of forty-six regular contributors,
the five great and learned professions
of Law, Theology, Medicine, Journalism,
and Education are numerously and ably
represented. Also Freemasonry, Odd Fellowship,
other benevolent societies, and Agriculture.
2. Its system of voluntary contributors and
of selecting the best editorials from newspa;
pors, magazines, &c., brings it into direct
j sympathy with the people and a lively reprei
sentation of the living topics of the day.
3. Its practical treatment of manufactures,
mechanical arts and sciences, commerce, &c.,
| make it of practical value. It will pay to
: subscribe to this Magazine. No manul'ac|
turer can afford to bo without it. It will
deal largely with History, the History of
Manufactures, and other matter of real and
; permanent value.
Its several departments are distinctly dej
fined and the matter appropriately arranged ia
each, so it can be read logically and thus be
better understood, remembered, and referred
to. The varied contents are such as interest
and instruct every man, woman, and child.
5. Its entire freedom from worthless trash
and its numerous, ?hort, interesting, and
complete articles.
C. It offers $300 ia premiums for which
everybody can compete either in writing stories,
essays, poems, ice , or in canvassing for
subscribers.
7. It is beautifully printed and appropriately
illustrated.
We refer to Ifarbi?s*' Majazim, published
in Wilmington, Delaware, the enterprising
; manufacturing city of many churches. Weadj
vise each of our readers to send one dollar, the
! price of an anunal subscription with postage
j prepaid, or thirty cents for a single number,
j to Ilarknm' MajUint, Wilmington, Delaware.
j The December number now before us con]
tains 95 pages of reading matter, 20 illustraj
tions and prose, poetry, xc., on about 50 difi
fcrent topics.
As the children's department is particularly
; attractive, this number would make a hand!
some Christmas present for either adult or
| child.
There are about the same number of words
on a page as in Scrihner's Monthly, and the
i proprietor will send, to any subscriber for
1 Seribner, botl? Magazines at *4.00 per rear in
advance.
The December number of Old and Xev,
i which has been delayed by the destruction of
Messrs. Hand, Avery & Co.'s establishment
by fire, just as the number was about to ap!
pear, ends the sixth volume, but does not
| end the two serials now running in it. These
are, Mr. llale's realist story of 14 Ups and
Downsand Mrs. G re enough's idealist romance
of 44 Pythonia." Both of them are
fully maintaining the interest of their singularly
different narratives. There are three
! editorials in the number: the Introduction,
which makes soma sensible suggestions about
the business duties of the new Administration
; the Examiner Introduction, which advocates
what may be called a missionary
theory of literary criticism ; and the Introduction
to the Record of Progress, which sums
up the doings of the recent Unitarian Xatinnal
Cimforpnr<? in Rnitnn the
critical anil record departments, which are
full and instructive, there are in this number,
a sonnet to George MacDonaid, the novelist,
and some very sweet verses 41 to I. A. j" a
curious paper recommending the taxation of
church real estate, which, we fancy, will be
j rather unpopular; and another curious paper
, with a Swedenborgian version of the beginI
ning of Genesis, showing what Mr. Swedenl
borg supposed the 44 internal meaning" of the
bible to be: a queer little satirical sketch
translated from Hacklaender, the German
story-writer; a lively story called " A Day's
