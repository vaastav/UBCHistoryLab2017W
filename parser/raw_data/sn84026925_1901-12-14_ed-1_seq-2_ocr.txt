? Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, has
introduced in the senate, a bill to give '
the United States government supreme 1
jurisdiction in lynching cases and to 1
make participation in a lynching a capital
offense. (
? The first Democratic senatorial '
caucus was held in Washington last 1
Wednesday. All of the senators who
were elected as Democrats, except
Senator McLaurin, and all of those
who were elected as Silver Republicans 1
and Populists were present and parti- '
cipated in the proceedings. Senator
Jones, of Arkansas was unanimously
re-elected chairman. It seems that all
of the Silver Republican and Populist
senators with the exception of Senator
Teller, of Colorado, had entered the
Democratic caucus last spring. Senator
Teller also was present last Wednesday
and participated in the pro
ceedings.
? Washington has another big murder
sensation. On last Tuesday morning,
at 5 o'clock, Mrs. Ada Gilbert
Dennis, who conducts a fashionable
dress making establishment, was found
in her bed with her head smashed by a
piano leg and life almost extinct. She '
was conscious; but was unable to tell
anything that would lead to the probable
identity of her assailant. In a
moment of semi-coherency, she said
what Indicated that tne guilty party
was a woman, and that the name
would be found in her book. At last
accou its there seemed to be but little
probability that Mrs. Dennis would
recover.
? Says a Decatur, Ala., of Tuesday:
Ben Milam, colored, an ex-slave of
Lawrence county, is under arrest charged
with kidnapping Negroes and selling
them as siaves to the white managers
of a Tennessee river island plantation.
It is~ alleged that Milam would
induce Negroes to accompany him to
the island with the promise of securing
positions for them on the plantation at
good wages, and that when they reached
there he would sell them in bondage,
where they were confined within
stockades. It is said that a young Negro
who recently escaped from the island,
told the story and caused the arrest
of Ben Milam. He reports that a
kidnapped Negro has been confined on
this island as a slave for seven years.
? Andrew Carnegie has written to
President Roosevelt announcing his intention
to contribute the sum of $10,000,000
for the establishment of a national
university in Washington. He
desires the government to take cnarge
of the fund for the purpose of administering
it just as it administers the fund
bequeathed by Smithson, the Englishman,
for the establishment and maintainance
of the Smithsonian institute.
The proposed university is not to compete
with the universities already established;
but is to accept post graduate
students from all of them. It is intended
also that thfe university shall
devote most of its attention to original j
scientific research in the hope that this i
country may be brought to equal or ex- I
eel Germany along this line.
? Says a Zalfo. Fla., dispatch of Tuesday:
G. L. Powell and J. S. Overstreet,
two prominent naval stores manufacturers,
shot and killed each other in a
face-to-face fight about 10.30 o'clock
today. Overstreet went to Powell's
still, nine miles west of here, to see
about some hands. The two men had
some words, and both drew their pistols
and commenced firing. From what
facts are at present obtainable, both
men emptied their pistols without doing
any damage. Powell then went into
the house and came out with a rifle.
Roth fired together. Overstreet was
shot in the forehead and Powell just
below the heart. Overstreet was instantly
killed and Powell only lingered
for an hour. Powell was one of the
largest operators and owners of turpentine
lands in Florida. The affair
has created a tremendous sensation
throughout this part of the state.
? Says a Washington dispatch, of
Monday: The friends of the isthmian
canal are now watching for the next
move of the enemies of the canal, who
are allied with the Panama Railroad
company. It is expected that the favorite
device of playing the Panama
route against the Nicaragua route will
again be resorted to, notwithstanding
the majority report of the isthmian canal
commission. The friends of the
isthmian canal project say, however,
that never have the prospects for the
construction of a canal been so favorable
as at present. All conditions have
worked to this end within the past year.
Y/ith every obstacle heretofore advanced
removed, the finances of the government
are found in condition to warrant
the expenditure for the work, and
there is general satisfaction over the
outlook.
? Senator Morgan, on Tuesday, introduced
a bill providing for the construction
of the Nicaragua canal. The
bill provides an aggregate of $180,000,000,
of which $5,000,000 is made immediately
available and which aggregate
sum such amounts as are necessary
are to be appropriated by congress
from time to time. The control of the
canal and of the canal belt is vested in
a board of eight citizens of the United
States, in addition to the secretary of
war, who is to be president. The members
of the board are to be paid a salary
of $8,000 a year each, and they are to
be chosen regardless of political affiliation.
There is a provision authorizing
the establishment of a regiment
from the regular army on the canal belt
to properly guard it, and courts also
are authorized conformable to the powers
granted by the governments of Nicaragua
and Costa Rica. There also is
!i nrnvisinn makinir three divisions of
the canal (luring the construction and
there is to be a chief engineer and two
assistants on each division, the chief
to receive a salary of $6,000, and the assistants,
$3,000.
? Washington dispatch, of Monday, to
the New York Sun: Senator McLaurin,
of Mississippi, was walking down
Pennsylvania avenue with his brother
this afternoon and. having reached the
junction of Seventh street, where two
trolley car lines cross, was aroused
from his conversation by a terrific
clanging of a car gong. Half a hundred
other people heard it, too, and saw
a young woman standing on the track,
with a car rapidly approaching. The
motorman, apparently made no effort
to stop his car, assuming that the i
young woman heard his warning and h
would step aside. Her back was to- *
ward the car and the girl stood in the
tracks oblivious to warning shouts, a
calmly awaiting a car coming in the
opposite direction. Senator McLaurln, 3
realizing that tne girl was ignorant of
her danger, jumped toward the track, ^
and lifting her in his arms, forcibly ^
carried her to a place of safety. The t
spectators cheered the senator roundly
for his act. It was then discovered ^
that the young woman was deaf and
had heard neither the gong nor the d
shouts of warning. ^

The senate, on Monday, passed a res- j,
olution appropriating $75,000 in aid of il
the Charleston exposition. The resolu- *
tion was introduced by Senator Depew,
of New York. y
The political issue in South Carolina ?
is whether the government exists for j
the benefit of the people or the politic- ^
ians. Whether^the politicians are to be
the servants of the people, or the people
the servants of the politicians.

F
From all reports, it appears that the ^
Republican majority is not yet ready t
or willing to commit Itself to the Crum- j
packer proposition for the reduction of
southern representation. The leaders j,
see that the thing is loaded, and that
the damage by the recoil will be as t
great as that expected from the dis- g
charge.
The Republican leaders of the senate
have given out the information
that nothing is to be done about the
ratification of the reciprocity treaties n
? v>tr fvia 1 o to proalriant mo
IlCgUliaiCU VJ luvt * ?VW4V.W..% ||
Kinley. These treaties were designed j
to correct the most objectionable fea- j;
tures of the present high tariff and ?
to forestall the popular discontent that s
the late president saw coming. A lit- J(
tie time will probably show whether the t
present leaders are wiser than was the p
late president. c
1 v
Mr. Finley was placed upon two un- s
important committees, from which
fact it is fair to assume that he isn't
considered as seriously in congress as t
In this district.?Fort Mill Times. p
The committee on Pacific railroads d
has always been highly important and v
many a congressman has used his best \
endeavors for years to get a place on a
It without success. The same is true of o
the committee on Territories, and es- p
pecially since the acquisition of Ha- ii
wail. Porto Rico and the Philippines n
has that committee become one of the t
most important of the house. The se- s
lection of Mr. Finley as the South t
Carolina member of the congressional j,
committee ought to be taken as some s
Indication of what the other members a
of the delegation think of him. and ^
taken altogether we are unable to see p
that either Mr. Finley or the district g
has any serious cause for complaint. ],
The sensational Tlllman-McLaurin a
episode in the senate last Monday is of g
but little significance except when con- c
sidered in connection with Tillman's q
effort to keep McLaurin out of the next c
primary. Senator Tillman has been e
working to this end for more than a v
year. The first step was the unsuccess- t
ful effort to get condemnatory resolu- ii
tions through the legislature. The next t
important move was those resolutions i
in the state executive committee. This g
was unsuccessful. It was by this ac- n
tion, no doubt, that Senator Jones pro- o
posed to justify the refusal of the Dem- c
ocratic caucus to provide for Senator c
McLaurin's committee appointments, f
In a like manner the refusal of the e
caucus to be responsible for the com- t
mittee appointments will, next spring,
be used as a pretext to bar Senator
McLaurin from the primary. And rj
thus, without giving the Democratic
voters of the state a chance to express
themselves, will be settled a very t
important question in which the vo- r
ters thought themselves supreme.
v
Senator Hoar's plan for the suppression,
or mitigation, at least, of theH
crime of mob murder, by giving the '
United States jurisdiction in cases c
of lynching and making partici- c
panon in mem punisname wun death,
is entitled to the most impar- t
tial consideration. It may "conflict t
with" the jurisdiction of the states, but r
the states generally have proved their
impotence to deal with the crime, or e
their indifference to it, which amounts C
to the same thing in effect. The pro- t
posed measure is an extreme one, perhaps,
but the evil is an extreme one,
and a present one, and is deep-rooted 0
and growing. The victims of lynchers
are numbered by th.e legion; the punished
murderers by the handful. And
the crime has become of nearly every t
day occurrence. As all other laws aimed v
against it have failed utterly of their c
purpose, any new one that promises to
be more effective should be tried, and c
Senator Hoar's bill appears to afford 11
such promise. Most of the class of v
men who are disposed to lynch law. .
and are so defiant of state law and
courts, have a wholesome respect for v
United Staes law and fear of United i
States courts.?News and Courier. q
And thus The News and Courier, the ^
most incorrigible rebel of us all, sur- 0
renders state sovereignty. What next? ^
T^v-TVcot'Tv Pnllpftnr Dens the Ne- w.
pro chairman of the Republican state
committee of South Carolina, has gone
to Washington and is endeavoring to d
make it warm for Collector Koester. ^
He carries formal charges against Mr.
Koester, regarding the now famous r'
lynching bee in which he was concern- h
ed. Deas and his gang hope to have t;
the help of Senator Tillman in their
fight against Koester, on account of
McLaurin being directly responsible for u
Koester's appointment and because t(
Koester has heretofore made some vig- n
orous attacks upon Tillman's policies.
But we have an idea that they are
counting their chickens before they are c
atched. They don't know Tillman,
le is a fighter and a hard hitter, but
e always hits in front, and does not 1
o around behind ones back to strike 1
t him.?Union Times.
If The Times had waited until next >
ay, it would have hardly, published
he above, we think. In the mail that
rought us The Times, we received
ally papers containing dispatches to
he effect that Senator Tillman has
led the charges brought by Deas.
Ve do not remember exactly when that
lleged lynching occurred, whether
uring the administration of Governor
'illman of Governor Evans; but it
eems to us that if Mr. Koester were
eally guilty, his punishment by law at
he time, through the regular channels
f justice, could have been brought
bout with much better grace than ataches
to the present persecution.
The Observer heard not long ago of
he case of a young man, living in a
mall but growing town, who applied
o a prominent business man of anther
city for work. Inquiring about
he applicant, the business man was
old that he was the type of youth who
fas content to work at about $40 per
rionth salary, or less, perhaps, always
nxious to get away from his work at
he earliest possible moment in order
o spend his evenings with the young
idies, being something of a social high
Iyer. In the country town where this
oung man lived there was not a cometent
carpenter, brick-mason or mehanic
and when one was needed he
tad to be imported and paid at least
2.50 a day for his services. But the
roung man would have considered
earning a trade like any one of these
s beneath his dignity and position, so
le kept on at what he was already dong?clerking
in the country store.?
lharlotte Observer.
The Enquirer has also heard of this
roung man?maybe not of this particuar
one; but of his type. The type Is
ommon everywhere, not only in Charotte;
but throughout the country. It
s seldom that we hear of his amount
ng to much either In a business or inlustrial
way. It is because he mort;ages
the Independence that would be
lis In the future for the deceptive
leasures that seem to stand out before
dm In the present. The responslblliy,
however, Is not upon him alone,
t is upon society generally. There
hould be a higher premium upon
ndustrial merit and moral worth,
.nd a more general contempt for buterfly
idleness. We need to give more
.ttention to the character of the man
nd less attention to the character of
ds occupation. 1

The Congressional Record, containng
a full and accurate verbatim statenent
of the McLaurin-Tillman incident
n the senate last Monday, is to hand.
iYom The Record, it appears that arisng
to a question of personal privilege,
lenator McLaurin laid bare the conpiracy
by which certain Democratic
eaders are trying for personal reasons,
o rule him out of the party and deirive
him of the right of service on the.
ommittees of the senate. His speech
^as mainly a review of his course as a
enator who had been pledged by his
onstituents not to be governed by pary
caucuses on questions affecting the
>ubllc welfare. He did not say a great
leal that he has not already said; but
vhat he did say was forceful and conincing.
His political status he defined
.8 follows: "In my state we have but
>ne political party, and inside of that
iarty we have a primary system, which
3 regulated by law. Under that prinary
system we have the widest latinde
of thoncht and freedom of disons
Ion. This has been forced upon us by
he peculiar conditions which have exsted
since the war. I have repeatedlv
tated on the stump and elsewhere that
11 I wanted was an opportunity to go
iefore the people of South Carolina and
iresent my views to them upon the
:reat public questions of the day, and
et them pass upon them. I have said,
nd I say again, that If they think I
m wrong I am perfectly content to
top right there and let my political
areer end. But I claim that as a right,
'here Is no Republican party In South
larollna as you understand a party
lsewhere, and so long as the rights
I'hlch we enjoy under our primary sysem
are unabridged and left open there
3 no necessity for any other party In
hat state. This Is all that It means,
"o me freedom of thought, freedom of
peech, and liberty of action are worth
nore than a seat In the senate or any
fflce under this government." In the
ourse of his remarks, he also took ocaslon
to say: "I will not be driven
rom my party and I will not be forcd
Into any party where I do not wish
o go."

There Wa? No Agreement.
Says a Washington special, of Tuesday,
to the Charleston Post: It having
been stated that the exposition resolutions,
which passed the senate last
Wednesday, were intrpduced in that
body by Senator Tillman under an arrangement
which was satisfactory to
Senator McLaurin, their author, Senator
McLaurin states positively that he
entered Into no agreement with his colipne'iip
A a stntpfl in The 'Evenlne Post
last Wednesday, the resolutions were
drafted by Senator McLaurin, who
called them on Monday morning but
was shut out by an objection from Senator
Hoar, on the ground that the senate
could transact no business until after
the reading of the president's message.
Senator McLaurin says he had
no understanding with Senator Tillman
whereby he was to relinquish the
management of the resolutions. The
senator was on the floor Wednesday
and was prepared to call them up when
an opportunity presented Itself. Senator
McLaurin further stated that,
personally, he has no feeling In the
matter, and further than this explanation,
It would be improper for him to
speak of the actions of a brother sen^
tor outside of the senate chamber.
Mr. Covington and the Dispensary.
In The News and Courier's report ol
the proceedings of the State Baptist
convention at Florence, last week, the
following was said in regard to a Spar;
tanburg minister: "The Rev. J. E. Covington,
for the Rev. L. M. Roper, read
the report on temperance. The resolutions
condemned the sale and use of all
kinds of wines, liquors and beer as a
beverage, and recommended total abstinence.
Mr. Covington led the discussion
and for 30 minutes paid hit
compliments to all who had in anj
wov fnatarort tho fanira of the inldUi
tous dispensary law on the state oi
South Carolina. He said that he "did
not feel lovely to any of them and never
will, for this great sin." He severely
criticised the use of the profits
of the institution for educational purposes.
Mr. Covington waxed warm at
he told of how mad it made him every
time he had to pass by the dispensary
on Main street, in Spartanburg, which
was from six to eight times a day."
A Wedding and n Faneral.
^Bennettsville Advocate: Bethlehem
church, in the lower part of this county,
was the scene of a happy event and
a sad one?a wedding and a funeral?
within the same hour last Tuesday afternoon.
There was witnessed at the
same time and place the most extremely
opposite results of affairs of the
heart. One beautiful young lady stood
in the altar to enter into the joyful
consummation of her love. Another,
a few minutes afterward, lay in the
same altar, a self-destroyed victim ol
blighted affections. The first was Miss
Annie Lou Rogers, who was married
in Bethlethem church, at 3 p. m., to J
E. Gregg, of Florence county. There
was a large gatheriir#*bf the bride's
friends and relatives, the scene was
one of gaiety and happiness. Just after
the bridal party retired, the lifeless
form of Miss Lily Harper was borne
into the building, and the minister was
called upon to perform, a rite very different
from the first. Brightness was
changed into gloom, and heavy hearts
took the place of light ones. Miss Harper
committed suicide by drowning herself
in a mill pond in Marion county
Monday. It Is believed that disappointment
In love caused by her parents
refusing to allow her to marry the
man of her choice, wnsithe cause of het
self-destruction.
The Rood Rondo Convention.
Greenville special, of December 11, tc
News and Courier: The various committees
having the management of the
Good Roads convention have everything:
well In hand to secure a large attendance
and a successful demonstration
of the value of good roads to cities
and the country and the economy
In building permanent roadways. Arrangements
are being made with hotels
and boarding houses to entertain
visitors at reduced rates. Many private
families have consented to take
boarders during the week of the meeting,
while other families have Invited
friends and relatives from other parts
of the state to be here. Everything Indicates
a very large number of visitors
from all parts of the state, and a good
number from North Carolina and Georgia.
The good roads special train will
reach Greenville on Sunday, the 15th
Instant. Monday will be given to unloading
and getting everything In order
to start work on Tuesday. Seven carloads
of rock have already arrived.
The first work will be done on Washington
street, which runs from the
Main street directly to the Southern's

how much of this street will be macadamized.
A road will be built outside
the city limits. The Good Roads

<RT Says a Washington special of December
11: A conference of southern
republicans in congress was held her?
tonight, it which were present Senaton?
McComas, of Maryland, and Pritchard,
of North Carolina, and members of the
house from West Virginia, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Missouri and Maryland.
The chief feature discussed related to
the apportionment of representation
from the south, with particular reference
to Mr. Crumpacker's bill, which
seeks to reduce the south's representation
on the ground that the Negro is
deprived of his vote. The discussion
was entirely informal in character, and
no action was taken by the conference.
The talk showed that the members
were not entirely in accord with re-;
spect to the bill. Senator Pritchard declared
his opposition to it. Another
meeting will be held next Wednesday
night, at which it is expected some
agreement will be reached as to what
course the Republicans from the so.uth
will adopt on the measure when it
comes up in the Republican caucus.
The southern Republicans hope soon to
perfect an organization for the protection
of the interests of that section
coming before congress.

THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS.
The annual meeting of the county
board of commissioners was held in the
office of tne county supervisor last
Wednesday, pursuant to the duly advertised
announcement. All of the
members were present.
mere was a nooa or accounts Deiorc
the board for payment, most of the
holders urging that they wanted the
money with which to pay their taxes.
The report of the treasurer, however,
showed only a small amount of available
cash on hand, and as the law forbids
the drawing of warrants when
i there Is no money with which to pay,
but few warrants were drawn.
As usual, there were several petitions
from Indigent Confederate soldiers
and widows for outside help.
Some of the petitions .were granted
and others were laid aside for further
consideration. The commissioners are
beginning to view with much concern
the noticeable steady increase in the
number of such petitions being filed.
During the meeting, the commissioners
gave careful consideration to the financial
condition of the county. It appears
that since the building of the
new court house, the $10,000 borrowed
for that purpose, has been carried over
from one year to another, being taken
care of by means of a new loan from
year to year. On account of this and
other smaller amounts borrowed, the
county has to pay Interest charges to
the amount of about $1,000 annually,
and the commissioners are of opinion
that other arrangements should be
made. For the present it was decided
to ask for an increase of one-half mill
on the tax levy.
"The supply bill" for next year was
agreed upon as follows:
For county auditor $ 500
For county commissioners and
clerk 1,000
For county treasurer's commissions,
for county and school
only 600
For county board of equalization
350
For jury, witness and constables'
tickets 4,000
For clerk of court 1,000
For sheriff 2,000
For trial justice and constables. 3,000
For coroner 400
For poor house and poor 2,000
For repairs on roads and bridges 4,000
For chaingang 4,000
For repairs on public buildings.. 500
For contingent fund 1,000
For public offices 1,000
For post mortem, examining lunatics
and conveying 800
For jury commissioners and insurance
100
For court house 500
For county jail 300
For Catawba river bridge 2,000
For interest on Catawba river
bridge note 420
For physicians' and attorneys'
fees 500
For county superintendent of education
and examining board 650
Total $30,620
The total levy necessary to raise the
foregoing amounts is 5 mills, and in addition
to the foregoing, the board recommended
township levies to pay interest
on Charleston, Cincinnati and
Chicago railroad bonds as follows: In
Catawba township, 2j mills; in Ebenezer
township. 1J mills; in York township,
3J mills.
THE CHERRY TREE FRAUD.
At last the Amos Owen Cherry Tree
company fraud has been officially exposed.
Franklin Sherman, Jr., entomologist
of the North Carolina Crop
Pest commission, visited Henrietta
last week, investigated the matter
thoroughly and submitted a detailed report
to Mr. S. L. Patterson, chairman
of the commission. The report is published
in full in the Charlotte Observer,
of Thursday.
It appears that among other things
the Amos Owens Cherry Tree company
was using, as a part of its advertising
matter, an alleged certificate from
the Crop Pest commission, setting
forth that the chery trees offered for
sale had been duly inspected and found
to hp ud to all reouirements and Dron
erly marketable, etc. With regard to
this, Mr. Sherman explains that on
September 6 last he gave Dr. Frank
Bright, of Henrietta, such a certificate
to cover a few trees that had been
properly inspected. It develops, however,
that since that time trees have
been brought to Henrietta from different
parts of the state, wherever they
could be found and fraudulently sold
and shipped under this certificate.
With regard to the history of the firm
the report says:
Dr. Frank Bright (formerly of Henrietta,
now moved to Florida), started
the affair, and feeling soon became
strong against him in Henrietta, and
about October 1, 1901, he disposed of the
matter, leaving it to his father, Rev. T.
Bright, who had the company incorporated
during October, and sold it to
C. D. Wilkie, of Rutherfordton, about
November 1. Mr. Wilkie was the author
of an article published at about
this time, stating that the company
was on a firm basis and doing a legitimate
business (or to that effect). He
sold to Chas. Watkins, of Henrietta (?)
and Geo. W. Rollins, of Forest City,
about November 20, and they sold to
M. C. (or C. M.) Paget, of Henrietta (?)
or Forest City (?) about November
25th.
Mr. Sherman talked to quite a number
of people in and around Henrietta,
and every one who was not interested
in the firm denounced it as a fraud.
The people told of numerous claims by
agents, especially from a distance, that
had not been paid. In some cases these
H nims were afterward Dresented in
person or through acquaintances in
Henrietta, and the company paid them
to avoid exposure. The present status
of the company Mr. Sherman gave as
follows:
At the time that I began this investigation,
Friday, December 6, I was informed
that Mr. M. C. (or C. M). Paget
was the owner of the concern. On
Saturday, December 7, I heard that he
had disposed of half of bis interest, and
on Thursday, December 10, I heard
that he had disposed of the remainder.
On Monday, December 9, I called at
Forest City (then the mail office of
4
the company, and may still-be), to see
Mr. Paget, but was told that he had
gone to Rutherfordton. In this connection
It may be that Mr. Paget had had
time enough so that he could have
learned of my presence, and also, that
I am informed that the corporation
papers of the concern were drawn under
the direction, supervision, or other
guidance of a certain Rutherfordton
lawyer, or lawyers.
In concluding his report Mr. Sherman
says:
Th^ main evidences of fraud
brought out by the investigation are as
follows: *
1. Non-payment of agents. 2. The inferior
quality and grading of trees. 3.
The false statements of employes regarding
the source of trees. 4. The
false claims made by the company in
its circulars. 5. The frequency with
which the ownership of the concern
has changed hands. 6. The direct
fraudulent dealings of the company in
purchasing trees from distant sources
(Mitchell county), and having such
trees shipped under the label "Amos
Owen Cherry Trees.
After carefully weighing the facts,
I am moved to make the following recommendations:
1. The absolute withdrawal of the
certificate now In use by the company.
2. The notification of the postmaster
general at Washington that the company
has been found fraudulent with
request that a fraud order be Issued for
the following postoffices: Forest City,
Ellenboro, Caroleen, Henrietta and
Rutherfordton.
3. The notification of station agents
at the following points that the company
cannot legally ship stock: Caroleen,
Henrietta, Forest City, Bostic,
Rutherfordton, Mooresooro, Lattimore,
and Shelby.
4. The publication of a condensed
account of the findings in every dally
and weekly paper in North Carolina,
and in the leading papers of Atlanta,
Columbia, Charleston, Norfork and
Richmond, with request that the item
be published for four consecutive issues,
if same can be done without
charge.
5. The publication of an account of
this affair as soon as possible in the
bulletin of the North Carolina department
of agriculture.
6. The submission to the governor of
the facts in the case, in order that he
may act according to his best judgment.
7. The posting of notice of the fraud
in the postoffices of Forest City, Ellenboro,
Caloleen. Henrietta and Rutherfordton.
It Is my opinion that no effort should
be spared to make the fraud known to
every person". The fraud has been
practiced almost exclusively upon women
and girls, mostly of the poorer
classes. It seems to me that the men
who have been the guilty parties
should receive all the odium accumulating
from their fraudulent acts.
As it is likely that those who have
had this company in charge will be
sued, it is my opinion that the crop
pest commission should do all that it
can to aid the aggreived parties in
bringing the defrauders to justice.
Very respectfully submitted,
Franklin Sherman, Jr.,

Washington special of Tuesday to
The News and Courier: At a meeting

Finley was selected as
South Carolina's representative on the
congressional committee. Representative
Finley introduced a bill today to
clear the military record of Marcus

ever since.
Smallpox at the Chalngrangr.
Speaking of the smallpox situation
at the chaingang on Wednesday, Supervisor
Gordon said the story to the
effect that Dave Logan has smallpox
again, is incorrect. Logan, he said, j
did have smallpox while he was on the 1
chaingang last spring, and he is suffering
from a breaking out no\y; but it
is hardly a ne wcase of smallpox.
"Some people around here," said Mr.
Gordon, "have been trying to make it
appear that they do not believe there is
any smallpox out at the chaingang at
all. The suggestion was made to me
today and I offered to give ten dollars
to the man who would go into that
pest tent and remain an hour. There
were no takers," Mr. Gordon concluded
with an amused chuckle.
Hiirjflnry at Hickory Grove/ N.
Burglars entered the store of MrNj.
N. McGill, at Hickory Grove, last Wednesday
night, and carried off a quantity
of flour, several pairs of shoes and
some coppers. Other articles were
probably stolen; but as to that there
was no way to determine definitely.
The burglars entered through a window,
after tearing off the blind and
smashing out the sash. Prom the character
of the work, it appeared that they
were rather green hands at the busl
