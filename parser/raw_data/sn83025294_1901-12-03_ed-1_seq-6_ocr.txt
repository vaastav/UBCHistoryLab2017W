Tilt PRESIDENT'S MtSSAGE •
This afternoon the Inter Mountain
lays before its readers the full text of
President Roosevelt's message to con
gress. It was read before the joint as
sembly today, the reading beginning at
midday. The message,, in its com
pleted form, has been in possession of
the newspapers for days. The Associat
ed Press was trusted with the document
and in turn gave advance copies to its
patrons with the reservation that the
contents were to be kept a profound se
cret until the message was read before
congress. Today at 13 o'clock the signal
was flashed from Washington that the
document was released for publication.
So the first message o* President Theo
dore Roosevelt is laid before the Ameri
can people this afternoon for their con
sideration.
It is in all respects the most readable
document ever sent out by a president.
There is not a dull line in the entire
extensive review of foreign and domestic
affairs. The hand of the practiced writer
shows in the entertaining style of com
position and the vigorous personality
of the president is evident throughout.
It scintilatcs with ideas tersely ex
pressed. In the u.scussion of matters
pertaining to the army and navy, In
dian affairs and Western arid lands the
president writes as one who knows from
intimate personal acquaintance every
phase of the subject of which he treats.
In respect to the wide range of sub
jects with which it deals in a practical
familiar way the message is the most re
markable official document ever written.
It is inspiring in its freshness and
originality. The huge mass of extracts
from annual reports, the figures and ar
gumentative statements and statistics
which have marred the messages of other
presidents are missing. President Roose
velt has given congress a clear and can
did expression of his own opinions pre
pared with industry and patience and
he has incorporated nothing in the mes
sage that is said from a departmental
point of view. He is no tyro in the art
of writing. The message is the prod
uct of a man of letters and affairs.
Fame and the good will of the nation
will be President Roosevelt's reward for
writing a message which his fellow citi
zens can read without exhaustion.
• • *
The president first touches upon the
death of the late President McKinley.
A deserved tribute is paid to the public
life and private character of the lament
ed executive, and attention is called to
the necessity for a law designed to pre
vent a repetition ofganarchistlc violence.
The recommendation is made that fed
eral courts be given jurisdiction over
crimes against the person of the presi
dent and those in line of succession, and
that immediate steps be taken to stamp
out anarchy. The president sensitoiy
suggests the wisdom of keeping an
archists out of the country, and believes
International treaties should be made to
that end.
* * •
Account is next taken of the prevail
ing prosperity. Law, the president says,
cannot create prosperity, but favorable
conditions may easily be reversed by
mischievous legislation. Trusts are char
acterized as 'a serious social problem,
and after cautioning at length against
hasty and ill-advised action, it is recom
mended that a law be passed conferring
upon the general government super
visory control of corporations engaged
in inter-state business! Publicity is rec
ommended as a remedy for the evils
arising from vast combinations of cap
ital. This portion of the message de
serves the thoughtful perusal of all citi
zens. It is a temperate but firm expres
sion made with the 'best interests of the
whole country kept steadily in view.
• • •
Labor and all its interests are touched
upon by the president in a way that will
delight friends of labor the world over.
After advising in favor of a new cabinet
officer, to be known as the secretary of
commerce and industries, convict con
tract labor is unqualifiedly condemned,
and the emphatic statement'is made th'rt
a federal law should be passed forbidding
Bight work by women and children. No
better friend of the wage earner has
ever spoken than this message proves
the present Incumbent of the executive
chair to be. Praise, caution and friendly
counsel is given the toiler, the declara
tion is made that all government work
must be "fair," and eight hours be a
full day's labor. When significant men
tion is made of the value of Ute rule of
brotherhood, the reader is impressed by
the fact that the president has expressed
in a sensible way the best sentiments of
organized labor and given substantial
encouragement to the cause of the wage
earner.
* • •
In the interests of American labor the
♦resident earnestly recommends the rigid
exclusion of Chinese, and greater care
in admitting immigrants who are below
I'he economic standard of fitness. His
.chief, concern is to protect the present
occupants of our Industrial field against
an Intlux of cheap labor.
• * *
•'Nothing could be more unwise than
to disturb the business interests of the j
country by any general tariff change
at this time." In this sententious dec
laration is expressed the gist of the
president's views upon the tariff. The
general belief that the present protective
tariff admirably meets the country's
needs is indorsed, and nothing in the
nature of tariff revision is even hinted
at. Reciprocity i? mentioned as a valu
able auxiliary to protection, and a strong
plea is made for government encourage
ment of the merchant marine.
The timely and judicious action taken
to establish gold as the standard of .
money is referred to and the need of a
better national banking law is pointed
out. Reference is made to the need of
a currency which will be sufficiently
elastic to respond to the demands of do
mestic trade. There is a plea for econ
omy in the various departments of gov
ernment. and the inter-state commerce
law is given attention to the extent of
suggesting needed improvements.
In reviewing the work of the agricul
turai department the president makes
the statement that the forest and water
problems are perhaps the most vital in
ternal questions before the people of
the United States. Concerning the
former he urges that game preserves be
established and better protection from
lire assured, and with respect to the
latter the plan of storage reservoirs is
indorsed. Residents of the West will
agree after reading this portion of the
message. that the president has a com
plete understanding of the needs of the
arid sections, and government irrigation
has in hint a staunch supporter. The
president's recommendations along this
lino are in keeping with the views he
has previously expressed, and no part
of the message is more emphatic than
the portion which points out the need
of government irrigation of Western
lands and the benefits which will come
from this undertaking.
* * *
Interesting reference is made to th
!
j
j
,. territories. The '
e
legislation for our new
attention of congress is called to the
need of laws relating to the public lands
of Porto Rico, and file president urges
that the tariff on imports from Cuba lie
reduced. Concerning the Filipinos, the
president recommends that laws fce
passed which will open the way for the
development of the islands, and that
measures be taken to fit the people for
industrial pursuits which will enable
them to lay the foundations for self
government. It is urged also that pro
vision be made for soldiers disabled in
the Philippine campaign. -
• • *
The crying need for a Pacific cable is
pointed out, and the president asks that
not a day's unnecessary delay in begin
ning this work be allowed. The con
struction of an isthmian canal is named
among the projects which are of the
utmost Importance to the nation, and!
congress is congratulated upon the fact !
that the new treaty with England, soon
to be laid before it, provides that
America alone shall do the work of
building, and legulate the use of the
waterway by other nations. In this por
tion of tlie message the condition of
amity between the nations of the earth
is noted, and the Monroe doctrine is re
ferred to as the means by which peace
on t'he Western Hemisphere is assured.
While reviewing with patriotic pride
the efficiency of the navy, the president
takes occasion to call attention to the
demand for increased naval force upon
the seas where our commerce floats. He
asks that additional seamen and marines
be provided and that the meaningless
title of "naval cadet" be done away with
and the historic title of "midshipman"
be restored. Better instruction is asked
for in the naval service, and other minor
changes are urged with such force and
evident understanding as to call to mir.d
the president's service as assistant sec
retary of the navy.
» • *
The section of the message which
begins with the statement that a larger
army is unnecessary will disappoint
captious critics who have exploited the
military career of the president with a
view to denominating him a loves of
military show. He discusses the needs
of the army in an entertaining way, and
with characteristic phrase dismisses sub
ject after subject with sensible hints re
garding the improvement of the service.
« * *
Sound civil service ideas bristle
throughout the portion of the message
which treats of government employes,
The merit system has the unqualified
indorsement of the president. Indeel,
lie suJQ it is as much American in its
spirit as is the public School.
« » •
The time has come, the president says,
when the government Should stop deal
ing with Indians as a tribe, and treat
them as individuals, distributing their j
holdings amongst them and breaking !
forever the tie that binds them to the
ancient practices which have stood in
the way of their progress.
• • •
The St. Louis exposition is touched
upon with a brief reference to the
Louisiana purchase. The exposition at
Charleston and the Pan-American are
mentioned in terms of praise. Touching
the Smithsonian institute, the library
for congress and the permanent census
bureau, the messest is terse and sen
tentious, although ( full measure of
praise Is given earth for the. excellent
work accomplished.
• • •
The remarkable growth of the postal
service is commented upon, and for tl'e
first time in his extended review of na
tional affairs the president uses figures
to illustrate the changes that have taken
place With Che growth of a department:
of government. He makes cheerful note
of the fact that in 1S97 the annual deficit '
of the postal department was $11,41*1,779, !
and this has been reduced to ♦3,92:1.7^7
in 1901. Revision of the rules of^the de
partment with respect to second-class
mail matter is suggested, and frt?£ rurtl
mail delivery is earnestly recommendcl.
A comprehensive review of the troubl
with China and t'heir settlement is glveh,
and the message mentions thd F.iti
Amerlcan congress and reeohiitteufls
suitable restitution in the ease 'of (tic
Weil and La Abra awards jjguinst
Mexico. . 1
* • *
In conclusion, the president j reyei-jts
again to the nation's loss in the death of
President McKinley. He acknowledges j
expressions of grief and regard from j
rulers of other countries, and the deatiis
of Queen Victoria and of the Empress
Dowager Frederick of Germany are nion
tioned with respect. A hearty expression
of gratitude to the Almighty for the
peace and good will with which the na
tion has been signally blessed brings the
message to an end.
« * *
No intelligent citizen who desires a
clear comprehension of the domestic and !
foreign policy of this government should j
fail to read the president's message en
tire today. It is a most accurate mens- )
ure of the president's character- and i
ability. It is up to expectations and is '
a document that will make all republi
cans and many democrats thrill with
pride.
MORE CAUSE FOR REJOICING.
Every republican in Montana who
reads the president's message today or j
tomorrow will have cause to rejpipe in
his own republicanism. It is a delight ito j
every republican to realize his affiliation j
with a party that has accomplished ris
much for the advancement of a prosper- j
ous civilization as the republican par^y !
(has accomplished. It must be an uh- j
aIlo >' ed J°>" to reflect upon the character
and progress of a nation thatvtoonSts
such achievements and such leadership
as the republican party claims,' No
patriot of any political party càfl.reid
the president's message without a thrill
of pride as he contemplates the wonder
ful showing it makes and the brilliant,
fearless, magnetic reformer and patriot
who compiled and wrote every para
graph it contains. The republican party
has saved the nation from the industrial
paralysis which was - threatened ns n
result of democratic incompetence.' It
has fought democracy for every foot of
progress the county has made since 1S96.
From the time when Cleveland borrowed
$262,000,000 and Professor Wilson put
through congress his monstrous Iniquity
w hielt took away the work and wages
front 10.000,000 American citizens and
e °n\ erted 3,000,000 into wandering mendi
C£Ults ' f>° m the time when a thousand
banks and an hundred railroads went
imo ^ lle bands of receivers, the people
of **is coun try have studied the bitter
lesson of democratic fraud and failure,
On the first chance «hey restored the re
publican party to power. They have
kept it in power ever since. They will
keep it in power as long as it shall be
true to itself and to the flag.
Republicans have a right to rejoice.
They advocate principles which are the
basis of national prosperity and: Which
neither the orators nor organs of de
mocracy are able successfully to attack.
They are principles which have rescued
the nation from the democratic 'Slough
of despond and enabled it tb tqke ;
front rank in the march of p^ojgrcss. !
Republican policies and republican
diplomacy have brought to the. nfction !
peace and plenty a,t home, honor and in- j
fluence abroad. That is why republicans
are jubilant.
SENATOR CLARK'S RAILROAD FIGHT.
Circumstances may yet compel Sen
ator W. A. Clark to become a prominent
figure in the railroad world and contest
with railroad kings in the East for the
right to do business in the West. No
sooner had his business judgment con- i
vineed him that a cut-off line between !
Salt Lake and Los Angeles would cap
ture the business of Southern Callfornta
than the magnates of the East, who had
ignored or overlooked the opening for
20 years, began to combine against him.
He originally desired to build only be
tween the two points named, and possi
bly northward from Salt Lake to Butte,
to connect with the Great Northern and
Northern Pacific, but now that the war
has opened, he maybe compelled to eater
the Colorado field in self-defense. 'He
has the money and the nerve, 1 and: if
there be truth in the report that Oolqnel
Dodge has Joined hands with hfrti there
will be sparks flying before long.! A
Chicago dispatch of the 30th utt,. sgy|:
The progress of Senator Clarjt's Sun
j pedro, Los Angeles Salt Lake yt^lrbad
! is being watched with great interest.: It
is not the road itself, but the develop
ments which are certain to resttlt from
its complyetion around which the; greatest
interest clusters. It is conceded Çhàt un
less Senator Clark can get a connection
independent of the lines of 'the Geo ge
J. Gould and Harriman combine, his road
will be unable to handle competitive
business in the event the Short Line also
builds into Los Angeles from Salt Lake,
of which there Is every indication.
In fact, while the two Los Angeles
roads have compromised as to the right
of-way through canyons where but one
line can Joe built, it is uofterstood that
3,
work will not be abandoned on either
line. Just what figure Col. D. C. Dodge
will cut in t'he Salt Lake Railway situa,
tion is as yet unknown, but It is'believed
that if he should decide to throw his in
fluence to Senator Clark, It will cost the
combine many millions to prevent the
formation of another competitive line
into Utah and Southern Clallfornta.
George J. Gould is credited with hav
ing decided to try to block any attempt
on the part of Colonel Dodge to aid Sen
ate Clark's road by buying up the Colo
rado Midland or getting Control of its
stock, thus forcing Senator Clark to seek
another outlet, whfeh would mean the
building of from 700 to 1000 miles of ex
pensive railroad.
THE SENATORS IN HARMQMY.
In the upper house at Washington yes
terday Senators Clark and Gibson walked
arm in arm to tile presiding officer's seat
to be sworn in. Their seats in the cham
ber are side by side, which Is true of t he
delegation of no other state.
The harmony of the Montana senators
as to their personal relations will, it is
hoped, be continued in their official
work. In all matters affecting the in
terests of Montana it is the hope of
the Inter Mountain that the two sena
tors will work in that spirit of amity
which alone assures success. Whether
they propose to act with their party in
opposition to protection, reciprocity and
expansion will appear later, but on every
non-political issue affecting the interests
of their constituents they are likely to
co-operate to accomplish the best results
for the people. On the question of irri
gation and all other rights and needs of
the people of the west the Inter Moun
tain confidently expects them to labor
with a single purpose in view and with
out a taint of personal or partisan bit
terness. Their interests are bound up
with those of the people, and the re
publicans of Montana, though opposed
to them earnestly and honestly on politi
cal principle, bespeak for them the con
fidence of all good citizens, and unite in
the wish that t'heir terms of senatorial
service may be both pleasant and suc
cessful.
Whatever may be the causes operating
to depress Amalgamated stock, it is cer
tain that none but the enemies of Butte's
'business and labor interests derive any
pleasure from the decline. It is equally
certain that both the company and its
employes are anxious to continue work
as neither can make money by closing
down or curtailing the supply. Embar
rassment and delay from whatever
cause injure the company and its em
ployes no less than they do every real
estate holder and every business and
professional man in Butte.
Yesterday it was thought that 16 of the
Inter Mountain's pages would be suf
ficient to contain the news of today, the
advertisements and the president's mes
sage. """Extra advertising, however, has
forced the paper to expand to eighteerf
page form this afternoon. The announce
ments of Butte merchants this month
will l^e of more than usual interest and
the çvening paper takes them into homes
where they are leisurely read and com
mented upon while plans are being made
for the next day.
By all means Arizona should be ad
mitted to statehood at this session of
congress, but first the Arizona judge
charged with corruption should be in
vestigated, and, if found guilty, exposed,
for neither statehood nor any other boon
will help Arizona so long as the courts,
high or low, are open to suspicion. One
rotten judge on the bench can keep more
capital out of a territory and discourage
more enterprise and ruin .the value of
more property than all the mines within
its borders can attract.
The up-to-date practices of officers of
the law in Oklahoma territory are ad
mirable. Saturday a sheriff chained a
railway train to the track and compelled
the payment of an employe's salary
before the cars were allowed to move.
In a state where a sheriff is able to
handle a train with only a log-chain to
prevent Its escape, the governor with all
the machinery of the courts at his back
should find it an easy matter to put a
railway combine out of business.
County Attorney Peter Breen is mak
ing a most creditable record in his cru
sade against public gambling with cards.
Well meaning men who said the vice
could not 'be suppressed have hadi recent
occasion to change their minds. How
ever, Mr. Breen has had to make the
fight alone, which is very much to the
discredit of the city administration. The
reform tendencies,of the city administra
tion are not much in evidence these
days.
There is a disposition to view with
alarm any prospect of an extra session
of the legislature. Neither the St. Louis
exposition fund nor the threatened rail
way combine have been regarded as
causes great enough to justify another
session of the Montan'a lawmakers. The
state is not eager for another season of
legislating, and there appears to be a
general disposition to frown upon extra
sessions.
The president strikes a telling blow
for the West on the subject of irrigation.
Congress must do something for the arid
lands of the Rocky mountains or It will
do nothing for the rivers and harbors of
the East. The lesson of Senator Car
ter's speech last year will never be for
gotten in Washington while the arid
lands remain arid.
The mining congress next year jv'il
bring to Butte 1000 men prominent In
mining and financial circles and help ad-'
vertlse Butte as the greatest mining city
in the world. Its undeveloped resources
are greater than those already opened.
President Roosevelt la eminently a
friend of the men of the West. In his
message he takes strong ground against
the unrestricted Influx of Chinese labor,
and evidently favors the revival of the
present treaty with China (by which the
Mongolian hordes are kept out of this
country. "No Chinese need apply" is
good republican doctrine.
A Pacific ocean cable.
Exclusion of the Chinese.
Irrigation of arid lands.
No disturbance of the tariff.
Legislation for American labor.
Such are some of the recommendations
of the president on issues largely affect
ing the West. Every workingman should
be a republican.
The gist of the president's message on
the subject of trusts is that their busi
ness affairs should be made public iby a
system of quarterly or semi-annual or
annual reports. He advises discrimi
nating legislation to regulate trusts so
that those which do good may be pro
tected from injustice and robbery and
those which do evil may be compelled
to mend their ways.
Let every workingman in Montana read
what the president says In his message
upon the subject of honest labor and
the measures necessary for its protec
tion. Labor has made the nation great,
and any laxity in the maintenance of its
dignity and its rights the president se
verely condemns.
For almost the first time in history
the members of the house and senate at
Washington broke into enthusiastic ap
plause when certain stirring passages
of the president's message were read.
It was an American message with a big
A, and every republican has a right to
be proud of the man who wrote it.
The governor of Idaho has declared
himself opposed to the railroad merger.
The governor of Montana is investigating
the subject and should have all the time
required to reach a conclusion. But his
constituents and the people at large have
a right to know when he expects to be
ready to act.
Senator Gibson says be is a free trader,
but still admits the people of Montana
are satisfied with the wool tariff. The
question arises: Is Senator Gibson in
AVashington to represent his own views
or the views and interests of the people
of Montana?
Senator Jones of Arkansas is finding
much opposition to his re-election. Jlis
connection with the Cotton-bale trust
has not been denied, because it is a dem
onstrated fact.
The democratic newspapers of the
East are trying to Ignore the democratic
party split, but the chasm is too wide to
be overlooked.
The discoveries now being made on the
flat east of Butte will soon be the means
of increasing the city's population to the
100,000 mark.
The president's message is so full of
good things that any just review of thje
document would be as long as the mes
sage itself.
The first bill to be enacted by congress
should be one providing for the arrest
(and punishment of anarchists.
Bright Ideas of
Montana Editors
The attention of citizens desiring
a pleasant location in which to settle is
directed to the particularly fine sample
of fall weather now on exhibition in the
Yellowstone valley.—Billings News.
There is no necessity of an extra ses
sion of the legislature. The state has
plenty of laws to cover the railway com
bine situation. All that Is required is
their enforcement.—Billings Gazette.
President Roosevelt is destined to re
gret his hearty, wholesale espousal of
President 'McKinley's policy. It appears
now that everybody who wants an office
claims he has long been a feature of
that policy.—Townsend Star.
Helena had a round or two of
manly sport, while Billings, not to be
outdone by any of its neighbors or any
of the remote places, opened up a club
of its own and furnished a mill that has
been the talk of the sports for the past
week.—Livingston Enterprise.
It has been never been given out what
the object was of organizing the Mon
tana society of Washington, D. C. It
may be shrewdly surmised, however,
that it was to serve as a committee of
safety to see that Representative Ed
wards, upon his arrival at the capital,
does not blow out the gas.—Helena
Record.
We may not all be living at the top
notch of prosperity, but the future Is
bright with promise. While the past
perhaps has proved a rugged road for
many citizens of this vicinity, the future
is more hopeful, and the prediction that
by next spring the great silver camps of
Philipsburg, Granite and Combination
will resume their former air of prosperity
seems to be justified by recent events.—
Philipsburg Call.
When the large body of agricultural
land now held under lease Is offered next
year It Is practically certain that It will
be all sold at good prices. The estimate
of Register Long that a sale next year
would bring a quarter of.a .million dol
lars Is not an extravagant one. As
rapUJly as possible this county wishes
to see the land go Into: the hands of peo
ple who will make their homes on them.
It don't wish to see a policy of dealing
with state land adopted that will per
manently fasten on us a system of ten
antry.—Inter Lake.
