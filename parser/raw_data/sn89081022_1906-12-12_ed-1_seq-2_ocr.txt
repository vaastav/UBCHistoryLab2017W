The approaching close of the fiscal
year of the Minnesota state fair
brought together the board of man
agers in an important: meeting at the
Merchants hotel in St. PauP last
Tuesday night There, was a general
rounding up of the business of the
year and a number of important sub
jects were brought before the board uy
interested parties.
President C. N. Cosgrove, of Le
Sueur, presided over the meeting,
which was attended by Vice Presidents
B. F. Nelson and C. M. Griggs, J. M.
Underwood, D. S. Hail, Win, E. Lee,
Col. W. M. Liggett, L. D. Baird, G. W.
Patterson and Secretary B. w. Ran
dall.
The first important matter to come
to the board's attention was an appli
cation from the Red Wing Manufac
turers''Association-for-the use of the
Manufactures Building on the fair
grounds during the fair of 1907, for a
special Red Wing exhibit. The asso
ciation had appointed S. Sultzer, E.
S. Hoyt, W. E. Cles»and W. H. Put
nam a committee to present the mat
ter before the state fair board, and the
application was backed by individual
applications for every foot of space
in the building. The committee guar
anteed good live exhibits. It is the
idea that if Red Wing makes a good
showing at the coming: fair other cities
in the state will follow her example
and In the course of a few yeais a
series of exhibits will have been held
in the Manufactures Building which
will be representative of the various
manufacturing districts of the state.
Definite action on the proposition was
postponed until after the annual meet
ing in January.
Winn Powers, of St. Paul, cam$ be
fore the board in the interests oi the
I. O. O. F. sovereign grand lodge,
which is to convene at St. Paul next
September. It is desired to have the
use of certain buildings and the grand
stand for quarters for the uniformed
corps of „the Odd Fellows, and is was
suggested that if the Sair could be
postponed until the week of the loage
gathering it would be for the inter
ests of both. This, however, will
hardly be possible as the fair date can
not be changed.
Mr. Wilcox reported $68,094.46 cash
on hand at the present time. A can
vass of the board showed that a ma
jority of the members will attend the
international livestock exhibition in
Chicago next week. During the week
the large breeders' associations will
have meetings and the National Asso
ciation of TTairs and Expositions will
meet and fix the dates of the fairs of
1907.
The program for the annual meeting
was talked over and various details
arranged. The principal address on
Tuesday, the opening day, will be by
Dr. H. M. Brown, of Hillsboro, Ohio,
a distinguished breeder and agricul
turist of that state.
More Money.
St. Paul—Minnesota's treasury is to
be enriched by the payment by the
government of over $67,000 for Indian
war bonds issued by the state in the
early '60s, and for which refundment'
had never been provided by the United
States.
State Auditor Iverson received word
from Washington yesterday that the
claim which the state has been vigor
ously pushing for over a year had- been
allowed, and that Minnesota would be
repaid the amount she had advanced
for the quelling of the Indian outbreak
of 1862.
Bonds to the value of $69,000 were
issued by the state, after the govern
ment, had guaranteed to make good
any expense the state incurred in put
ting* down the Indian wars. The bonds
were sold in New York by Governor
Ramsey, and the money used,~but pay
ment could never be secured from the
government. The matter was pushed
last year by Auditor Iverson and At
torney General Young, who took the
matter up personally with officials in
Washington.
The greatest aid was given by the
Minnesota delegation in congress, and
through their efforts, legislation was
secured, legalizing the refundment.
The matter has been Anally approved
by the treasury department, and the
state will receive $67,792.23.

About seventy of the most promi
nent men of Sweden have organized a

crease of the Swedish navy. The or
ganization was effected at the royal

It is taken for granted in Sweden
that the Germans generally call the
Swedes "die dummen Schweden" (the
stupid Swedes). Die Kolnische Zei
tung, a great German daily, recently
contained an editorial ori this interest
ing subject. The paper justly claims
that the Germans do not use said ex
pression, but that they have high opin
ions of the Swedes. The paper goes
on to deplore The fact that the Swedes
are led by this expression to look
upon the Germans with suspicion, so
that German business men are actual
ly handicapped "by the expression In
their competition with other nationali
ties for Swedish trade. The papei
finally suggests that the German press
make a united effort to root out this
misunderstanding on the part of the
Swedes.
A bit of spite work. P. P. Walden
strom, the ubiquitous and irrepressible
reformer, has occasionally been rather
severe on the Swedish railroad em
ployes because they are apt to take
a glass of liquor off and on. Now
they seem to be bent on getting even
with him. On a trip to Orebro to give
a lecture Waldenstrom seems to have
walked along the railway track a few
steps contrary to the rules, and the
station agent reported to the police
department that P. P. Waldenstrom
and two other preachers "walked," in
violation of law, from the platform of
the Orebro railway- stat!6n along the
track to the gate at Building Con
tractor P. Erikson's cottage." The
newspapers give a full account of the
joke.

A society which has for its aiih the
encouragement of the practice of sing
ing only the tune of a song has pub
lished a ^collection of hymns with
notes which give only the tunes. It is
highly significant that "such a musical
people as the Swedes have started a
systematic movement against an "ar
tistic" singing which only too often
has degenerated into something arti
ficial and even unnatural.
The students' singing society at the
university of Lund has celebrated its

The claims of Sweden are (based on
the fact that a number of Swedish

whales, walrus and other., polar ani

JC dispatch from:" Stockholm states
that A. Grip, minister of Sweden to
the United States, has been recalled,
Mr. Grip -has served in that capacity
at Washington for some years. He is
more than 60 years of age and is elig
ible for retirement according to the
practice in his country. It is said by
those who enjoy close relations with
the minister that his services have
been satisfactory to his sovereign and
surprise is expressed at the announce
ment of his recall. It was generally
expected that he would soon leave the
United States for an extended leave of
absence. This case is the more in
teresting because A. Grip figured so
prominently in the dissolution of the
union of Sweden and Norway. He
was the only Norwegian diplomat in
the service of the union who stuck to
King Oscar to the last, and some time
after the consummation of the dissolu
tion of the union, he was made a
citizen of the kingdom of Sweden.
It must be agreeable to the Nor
wegians to know that their royal fam
ily has good connections. Take the
way, for instance, in which the royal
couple were entertained at their re
cent visit to England. More gold plate
than the Rockerfeller or Astor man
sions can display was used at the state
banquet at Windsor castle in honor of
King Haakon and Queen Maud of
Norway. The weight of the whole
service is about five tons, and it is
valued at more than $5,000,000. Some
of the pieces are s6 huge that it re
quires four men and a push-cart to
move them. If they were solid gold
they would have to be moved with
derricks, but the heavier pieces are
only silver-gilt. Besides the wonder
ful "emperor's service,"' which is used
when royalty is entertained, there were
unique and magnificent pieces of plate
displayed at the banquet, including the
silver rosewater fountain, designed by
the prince consort, a punch bowl by
Flaxman, the famous "Nautilus" cup
of pearl, gold and silver by Benvenuto
Cellini, and a gold tiger's head, taken
from the throne of Tippo Sahib at the
storming of Seringapatam in 1799. St.
George's hall, where the banquet was
held, was made a bower of palms,
ferns, roses and orchids. Of orchids
alone there was quite $10,000 worth
used, but all the floral decorations
were provided from the king's hot
houses at Frogmore.

Some one suggested that Norway
try to get along with one admiral, and
somebody else answered, "Yes, it would
perhaps be better to have but one ad
miral than to have two that are quar
reling as at present."
Elias Hofgaard, manager of the
Hanaar institute for the deaf and
dumb, was killed by a railway train at
Lian station. He was visiting with
his brother-in-law, Lars A Havstad,
and was about to take a trip to Kris
tiania. He was standing on the plat
form as the train slowly approached.
Suddenly he fell down in front of the
engine, and he was cut to pieces. He
used to have fainting spells, and this
was no. doubt the immediate cause of
his death. No other Norwegian has
been so successful in teaching the deaf
and dumb.
The Norwegian labor unions have
been greatly troubled by party poli
tics, and in order to avoid this in the
future, a new labor union.is being or
ganized. The first paragraphs of the
new organization read as follows:
"The Free Labor Association of Nor
way has for its aim to gather the
workers in our country, men and wo
men, in the different trades, for the
protection and advancement of com
mon interests. Neither the association
nor any of its divisions shall join any
political or religious party nor shall
they or any of their members belong
to any other trades union." The ques
tion is: Will the Social Democrats
leave the old and join the new union?
The funeral of Fritz Thaulow, the
