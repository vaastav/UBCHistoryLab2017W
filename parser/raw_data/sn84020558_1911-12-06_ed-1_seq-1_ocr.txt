ONE WEEPS WHEN
DOOM IS SPOKEN
Judge Scathingly Arraigns
Confessed Felons and
Tells Them They Both
Merit Extreme Penalty
of the Law.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. The two
brothers. James B. and John J. Mc
Namara, of Cincinnati, one a slim,
droop shouldered, sallow-faced indi
vidual, with small eyes, the other ro
lwst and wiih a ruddy countenance,
felt the strong hand of justice they
had long thought to evade, the former
by imprisonment for life and the lat
ter, for fifteen years in the state pen
itentiary. Though the younger broth
er. J. 15., formally presenting a con
fession in court, declared he intended
no murder when he exploded sixteen
sticks of dynamite under the Times,
when twenty-one persons were killed.
John J.. tonight, recounting to his
attorneys his principles, broke down
and muttered that he had fought
against great odds the best way he
could.
This was a sequel to the courtroom
scene earlier in the day, when they
leceived their sentences with tears
and in abject surrender. It was for
the crime against the Times that
Jnmos IS. was punished. For direct
ing the destruction by dynamite of
the. Uowellyn iron works, where no
lives were lost, John J. was sen
tenced. Alter a .few hours had .gassed the
word wentTffttrth that subpoenns had
leen issued for both men to appear
before the federal grand jury and
divulge further details .of dynamiting
conspiracies. The United States will
now demand Information regarding
interstate trafficking in dynamite,
which, it is alleged, resulted in over
a hundred explosions at bridges and
factories where labor warfare was
involved.
Fifteen thousand persons surged
around the jail, exacting to see the
McNamaras taken In openly for sen
tence in the hall of justice, where
the previous scenes of the trial had
lKen enacted. But the court and
counsel had cognizance of possible
lawlessness and held the final session
in the courtroom adjoining the jail,
where the prisoners were brought by
the interior bridge passageway.
"I never carried a gun before or
since the McNamara trouble started,"
said Samuel L. Browne, chief of the
state's department of investigation.
Detectives reported suspicious char
acters by scores scattered in the
crowd. Judge Bordwell changed his
mind several times, but took a final
precaution and held court in a small
chamber beside the jail. Outside the
crowd begged for entrance, but po
licemen fought their efforts. The su
preme ordeal faced James B., who
wondered whether the court would
inflict the extreme penalty. John J.,
liable to a less severe penalty, was
anxious for his brother's sake. -Just
twenty-four minutes' procedure de
cided their fate, but the time went
slowly. It was quiet almost to the
point of monotony. The fortitude of
the men was mustered for the occa
sion, but it got a setback as Judge
Bordwell. in passing sentence, seemed
inclined to inflict the death penalty.
Though they did not come with se
verity. Judge Bordwcll's remarks cut
deep, and John's accustomed expres
sion, a half smile and half sneer,
passed into sad dejection.
Attorneys close by saw tears in
the eyes of John J., while J. B. Mc
Namara took his sentence calmly and
almost without comprehension of what
lay before him. Judge Bordwell talked
nervously and slowly. lie read slow
ly as he pronounced judgment. J. B.
arose first. He wore a dark suit, to
which his face contrasted. Fredericks
made a brief statement of the case,
reading the prisoner's confession for
the first time. As he spoke the court
room was still. J. B. stared hard at
the windows.
"There are two possible sentences."
Fredericks said, with delilcration.
"death or life imprisonment. Counsel
for the other side are aware of the
custom of granting consideration to
the defendants who plead guilty.
These defendants have served the
state in other ways. I think judicial
consideration should le extended be
cause of that fact."
"There is little or no ray of com
fort," Judge Bordwell spoke to J. B..
in the assertion that you did not
ntend to destroy life. Widows and
Orphans of the murdered men will
fjook on that statement at this time
:is a mockery. Tlie circumstances are
against you in making such a state
ment. A man who would put sixteen
sticks of dynamite under a building
full of explosive I do not refer to

Attorney Darrow Says the Evidence

LOS ANGELES, Dec. C "Nothing
but the gallows could be the end," was
the outcome predicted tonight by At
torney Darrow if the McNamara trial
had gone to the jury for a verdict.
I was here six months and .?pent
many troubled days and sleepless
nights trying to run down every clew."
said Darrow. "I tried to do the best
for my clients and the cause they
s rved, but from the first we never
hnd the slightest chance to win. There
are tho.-se who say we would liettor
go to the end of the trial and .-suffer
complete defeat. I would say scores
of witnesses could identify J. B. as
present, ipractically on the very day of
the explosion. One. at least saw him
in the building. The evidence was In
surmountable. I acted as I thought
best, and conceive no other way by
which we could save the lives of our
clients than in disposing of this case

CLEVELAND. Dec. .-.."Organized
lalior, the decent and orderly element,
will profit by the outcome of the Mc
Namara easo," declared Detective
William J. Burns tonight. "Just as
soon as it rids itself of such radicals
as Samuel Gompors, its progress will
be all the .more rayld. and satisfac
tory. 1 think the riublie should be
well satisfed with the sentence im
posed by Judge Bordwell. because if
Judge Bordwell. an eminently fair
and able jurist, considers the life
sentence of James B. and fifteen
yeHrs for John J. adeouate punish
ment, his judgment has all the weight
that could be given it by a long study
of the case. I can sny I am satisfied
with Judge Bordwcll's disposition,
though frankly I will .say the McNa
maras may consider themselves for
tunate in escaping a greater penalty.'
He said his reason to expect further
confessions by the McNamarns will
icfult in indictment of others not now
concerned in the dynamiting cases.

BNDITS DEFY POSSE
Bombarded With Dynamite Bombs
Before They Surrender
BELLINGHAM, Wash.. Dec. .
Two bandits. Walter Foote and Fred
James, fortified behind a breastworks
of logs on the hanks of the Skagit
river, near Sedro Wooley, for three
hours stood off a posse of 200 citi

were fired and forty dynamite bombs
thrown against the logs before the
highwaymen surrendered.
Foote was found to have seven bul
lets in his body and died soon after
having been taken to a hospital.
James was uninjured and was lodged
in the Skagit. county jail.
The men had ho!d up a saloon and
lobbed the safe, "covered" the town
marshal with revolvers and taken
away his weapons and valuables and
then escaped, pursued by a crowd of

LOS ANGELES. Deo. 5. Socialism
clinched with its foes under the good
government banner at the ballot box
today, anil was beaten. The red em
blem that waved over Harriman vic
toriously at the primary a month ago,
rank with him under an avalanche of
otcs. The only question remaining a
few hours after the election was the
size of Alexander's majority. Prohi
bition, another big issue of the cam
paign, received scant attention. Th
vote tonight indicates it is defeated.
It is estimated 140.SS0 is the total vote
cast. George Alexander heads the
!ctorious ticket with nine council
men. Tlie indications are that Alexander
may have a majority over his social
ist opjMinent of fio.ooi). In HarrimunY
own waid he received but 112 votes to
1537 for Alexander.
Prohibition, repr-sented by the most
drastic dry ordinance ever projiosed
for a city, went down in the ruck of
socialism under the landslide. Lead
ers of both factions declared the end
ing of the .McNamara wise hail much
to do with the result of the election.
"The pople who would not bring
themselves to vote for Alexander
stayed at home." said C. Graham,
vjt'uiiman of the good government or.
gauizalion. "The poor man would not
vote."' Is the explanation of Alexander
Iivine, manager of Harriman's cam

eration of Labor. I want to say that
if Miller has a case to prosecute

JUDGE SCORES
LOS ANGELES, Cal., Dec. 5. -Judge Walter Bordwell. lx-fore wh .m
the McNamara trial was conducted, and who today sentenced the two
dvnamiters to state's prison, has issued a statement to "correct some
misconceptions due to erroneous publications, and particularly an
article which appeared in a local paper over the signature of Lincoln
Stiffens, that the change in the pleas of the McNamaras from not
guilty to guilty was due to his or the efforts of otliers referred to
b him, as untrue and groundless. About the only true statement in
the steffens article is that which states the court had no part in an
negotiations for the termination of the case. The court declared the
case tame to an abrupt end solely because the defense saw the use
lessness of going further, after it was caught In the act of bribing
tahsmen and jurors. It was declared the state long ago could have
had a plea of guilty from J. U. if it agreed to let J. J. go free. This
it refused to do. The district attorney said the court would not accept
am plea of uilt from one and not another, as It held both equally
guilty. But when both pleaded guilty they could throw themselves
entirely upon the mercy of the court, with no agreement as to pos
sible sentence, other than that which usually goes to a defendant who
pleads guilty. The court declares he was not swayed In the least b
anything Steffens did or wrote, and characterized Steffens as an ad
mitted anarchist. "The lesson taught in these cases," the court added.
is that the law must le rigidly enforced against all. rich and poor,
high and low. capitalist and laborer, and that onI l obedience to
law can societv be maintained and its blessings enjoyed "
