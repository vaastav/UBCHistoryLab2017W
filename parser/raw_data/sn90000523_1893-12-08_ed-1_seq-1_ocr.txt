Congress assembled in regular ses
sion Inst Monday and the President's
message was read before both
Houses on that day. The message is
lengthy and common place with a few
exceptions. As usual wttn modern
executives considerable space is tak
en up iu exploiting the beauties of
the civil service humbug. Consider-
aple space is devoted to deploring the
enormous amount of seed sent out
through the agricultural bureau. The
two points of general interests is the
Hawaiian matter and the tariff.
About the former, after recounting
the fact of a treaty made under the
Harrison administration, the Presi
dent says : '
This treaty I withdrew for exami
nation and sent James II. Blount of
Georgia to Honolulu as a special
commissioner to make an impartial
investigation of the circumstances at
tending the change of government
and of all the conditions bearing up
on the subject of the treaty. After a
thorough and exhaustive examination
Mr. Blount submitted to me his re
port, showing beyond all question
that the constitutional government of
Hawaii had been subverted with the
active aid of our representatives to
thnt govern men tj and through the
intimidation caused by the presence
of an armed naval force of the Unit
ed States, which was landed for that
purpose at the instance of our minis
ter. Upon the facts developed it
seemed to me the only honorable
course for our government to pursue
was to undo the wrong that had been
done by those representing us aud to
restore as far as practicable the stat
us existing at the time of our forcible
intervention. With a view of accom
plishing-this result within the consti
tutional limits of executive power,
and recognizing all our obligations
and responsibilities growing out of
any changed conditions brought about
by our unjustifiable interference, our
present minister at Honolulu has re
ceived appropriate instructions to that
end.
As to the tariff he approves the
Wilson bill and says :
It is the result of much patriotic and
unselfish work, and I believe it deals
with its subject consistently and as
thoroughly as existing conditions per
mit. I am satisfied that the reduced
tariff duties provided for in the proposed
legislation, added to existing internal
revenue taxation, will, in the near fu
ture, though perhaps not immediately,
produce sufficient revenue to meet the
needs of the government

President Cleveland's message, like the
Wilson tariff bill, receives much praise
from Canadian and English sources.
Van Alen, Cleveland's 60,0C0
Ambassador to Italy, declines the
honor on account of the stench it has
raised. The country can stand it.
It begins to look as if "Paramount"
Blount and Grover Cleveland would
go into history as two of a kind
par mobile fratrum. However Blount
has a little the advantage this is the
second time he has tried to pull down
the American flag. -
Uncle Sam has a big stock of slight
ly shop-worn Columbian stamps on

to furnish no others to postmasters
until they are all sold. There's more
than one way to make the public buy
an undesirable thing.
The Manchester (England) Courier
says that the Willson bill is "much

"The Same Wagea aa foreigners. "
The Philadelphia Ledger contaius
an interesting interview on the new
tariff bill with Colonel Charles II.
Banes, a prominent Democratic bus
inees man of the Quaker City, and a
former Democratic candidate for
Congress. In this interview Colonel
Baues, who stigmatizes the Cleveland
Wilson bill as a "hybrid" which "sud
denly disturbs with ruthless hands
the economic conditions of a genera
tion," also describes a conversation
which he had with Chairman Wilson
of the Ways and Means Committee
when the bill was in course of prepa
ration. "I affirmed," Colonel Banes
declares, "that the reduction contem
plated would fall most heavily upon
the laboring classes. Mr. Wilson's
reply was to the effect that, as 'our
American workmen are better housed,
clothed and fed, they could do more
work for the same wages than foreign
ers.'"
This is the whole case in a nutshell !
The fundamental and controlling prin
ciple of the new tariff scheme is that
American workingmen shall "work
for the same wages" as the foreign
pauper labor that lives in a hovel aud
dies in an almshouse. The theory
that the wage earners of the United
States are mere beasts of burden, who
can be forced to do much more work
under the spur of impending starva
tion than they do now, or than the
labor of Europe performs; is a pet
doctrine of the free traders. What
do the workingmen of America, whose
wages, homes and manhood are threat
ened, by the overthrow of protection,
think of this proposition ? Are they
willing to staud idly by and allow
American wages to be cut down one
half without reibtance ? New York
Press.
Canada is delighted with the Wilson
tariff bill. The Toronto' Globe . de
clares that "the free list Is most com
prehensive" and is "advantageous to
Canadians." The Montreal Herald
asserts that "our trade with the Uni
ted States) which has been rapidly
falling off for the last teu years, will
pick up wonderfully if the Wilson
bill becomes a law." Tbe'Montreal
Gazelle acknowledges that "Canada's
interest in the measure is somewhat
extensive," and publicly boasts that
"it is evident that the fact was not
forgotten by the framers of the bill

Vermont morgans and Merinos at Chicago
Dr. H. H. Mclntire, the Vermont
Commissioner to the Chicago Fair,
was in town on Monday to settle with
Mr. H. T. Cutts, of Orwell, the su
perintendent of the State Morgan ex
hibit, aud with the officials of the
Vermont Merino Sheep-Breeders' As
sociation, uuder the auspices of which
exhibits of fine wool sheep were sent.
Mr. Mclntire said after he had finish
ed his business that the Morgan ex
hibitors would receive about 30 per
ceut. of the premiums taken by their
horses, and the exhibitors of sheep
about 60 per cent. The entire cost
of the Vermont Morgan horse exhibit
at the fair was about $2350, of which
the State paid $1800. It was under
btood that the remaiuiug expenses
would be paid out of premiums, and
if this was insufficient, the balance
would be paid by the horse-breeders.
The baluuee of the expense, after the
payment of the State's $1800, is $550,
and as the premiums received amount
ed to $825, there remaius about $275
to be distributed to such exhibitors as
draw premiums. The sheep exhibit
cost $1100, of which the Stale paid
$1000. The winnings of Vermont
sheep were about $410. The Ayr
shire and Jersey cattle exhibits each
cost the State about $'J00. Compe
tition in these classes was heavy, be
tween 200 and 300 cattle being exhi
bited in each class. The amount of
premiums to any State or locality was
therefore correspondingly small.

The magnitude of the Interests
threatened by the Wilson bill is
shown by the census bulletins, which
gives the number of hands employed
and the amount paid in wages iu 123
cities of the Union. To fully appre
ciato the great stride in prosperity
made by the workingmen of the
country in the past decade, and also
to exh.hit a possible reason for the
hostility of the southern politicians,
the figures are given, as recorded in
the census of 1890. Thcv are as
follows :
In 1880, in the entire country, 2,
732,595 hands we're employed, or
280,916 more than in the 123 cities
in 1890. Of these, In 1880, only 874,-
448 were employed in the 16 southern
slates, while 2,245,792 were employ
ed in the 15 northern states east of
the Mississippi river the South has
only a few more than one-half the
number employed in the six New
England states, and only a few more
than one-third the number employed
in the three middle states of New
York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The wages paid in 1880 in the en
tire country were $947,953,795, or
$470,113,823 less than in the 123
cities alone iu 1890'. Of this amount
in 1880 only $100,569,924 was paid
in the 16 southern states, while $799v-;
783,533 was paid in the 15 northern
states. The South paid less than one
half the wages paid in the six New
Englaud states, and less than one-
third those paid in the three middle
states.
The majority of the men whom was
intrusted the work of framing a meas
ure to cut down, if not to wipe out,
the wages paid to some 6,000,000
in the United States come from small
tow n 8 and crossroads in the South,
where the principal manufacturing in
dustry is the making of democratic
majorities out of minorities.
The fireproof buildiug that will not
burn has apparently yet to be built.
The country should be tbnukful
that it at last knows what sort of a
tariff bill the Fifty-third Congress will
pass. Uncertainty is always disturb
ing to business.
The intellect of the man who seeks
vindication by bringing suits for libel
against newspapers is usually of the
didn't-kuow-it-w as-loaded caliber.
Wheu the fraud cry raised by the
Virginia populists is joined iu by one
of the leading -democratic papers of
that Slate it becomes more than the
wail of defeated politicians.
The man with "soulful" eyes is a
dangerous fellow. Sooner or later he
is liable to turn up as corespondent iu
a divorce suit.
Literary Note.
The largely increased size of Romanck,
since the beginning of its twelfth vol
ume, allows scope for a greater variety
than ever in its contents. This opportu
has been intelligently utilized by its suc
cessful editor, Mrs. Kate Upson Clark,
in the composition of a Christmas Num
ber of extraordinary brilliancy. Out of
Its score of charming tales ten arc espec
ially designed for the Christmas season.
They are of all sorts grave and gay,
long and short, and in almost equal meas
ure for both old and young. Among the
authors of Christmas stories are Octave!
Thanet, Martha McCnlloch Williams,
Francois Coppee, Mary C. Himgerford
and Madge Robertson ; while the other
contributors include Arthur Bcardsley

be expected, the -jiuinber is particularly
strong in merry and humorous stories,
