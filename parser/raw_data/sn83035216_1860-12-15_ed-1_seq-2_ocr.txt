As an abstract proposition it mj be ed
mittrd tht od valorem dutici would, In the
ory, l tli niot Just end equal. Hut if
the fiperienceof tbis and of all other com
mercial nation has demonstrated that audi
dotici canuot be esesed and collected
without great fraud npon the revenue, then
H la the part of wisdom to resort tosper-ific
duties. Indeed, from the very nature or
an ed valorem duty this mast be the result.
Under It the inevitable coneqnenee I thnt
foreign goods will be entered at loss than
their tine value. The treasury will, there
r
;
o
If
be
ci
fore, loose the duty on the difference, be
tween their real and fictitious taluo, oud to
thi extent we are defrauded.
Tbc temptations which ad valorem duties
nrescnt to a dishonest importer are irresist
ible. II i object to pass bis goods through
the cns!om-house at the very lowest valua
tion necessary to save tbcm from conQscn
tion. In this he too often succeeds in spite
or the vigilance of the revenue officer
Hence the resort to false invoice one for
the purchaser and the other for the custom
bouse, and to other expedient to derrnud
the Government. The honest importe
produces his invoices to the collector, stat
inr the actual price at which he pnrchnshed
the articles abroad. Not so the dishonest
importer end the agent of the mauufactnr
r. And here it mat bo observed that i
very larjre proportion of tho maVaetures
imported from abroad - arc consigned for
aale by commission merchant who are mure
gents cinplojcd by the manufacturers. In
such cases no acU1.1l Sule hns been made to
Ex their value. The fortigu manu!octurcr,
if be be dishonest, prepares an invoice of
the good, uot at their actual value, but at
the lowest rate necessary to escape detec
tion. In this manner the dishonest impor
ter and the foreign manufacturer enjoys a
decided advantage over tho honest mer
chant. They are thns enabled to undersell
the fair trader, and drive bira from the mar
ket. In fact, tire operation of thia system
has already driven from the pursuits of
honorable commerce many of that class of
regular and conscientious merchants, whose
character thronghout the world, is the pride
of cor country.
The remedy for these evils is to be found in
specific duties : so far as tbis may be practica
ble. Tbev dispense with any inquiry at the
tnstotn-hoase into the actual cost or value of
the article, and it pays the precise amount of
doty previously fixed by law. Tbey present no
temptations to the appraisers of foreign goods,
who receive but small salaries, and might, by
undervaluation in a few cases, reuder themselves
independent.
Besides, specific duties best conform to the
requisition in the constitution that "no prefer
ence abail be given by any regulation of com
merce or reveoue to the ports of one state over
those of another.' Under our ad valorem sys
tem each preferences are to some extent inevita
ble, Dd complaints have olteo been mude that
the spirit of tbis provision bad been violated
by slower appraisement of the same articles at
one port man ai anoiner.
Ao impression strangely enough prevails to
losne extent, that specific duties are necessarily
protective duties. Nothing can be more falla
cious. Great Britain glories in free trade, and
yet ber whole revenue from imports is at the
present moment collected under a system of spe
cific duties. It is a striking fact in this connec
tion that, in the commercial treaty nf 23 J Janu
ary, I860, between France arid hnglund, one of
the article provides that the ad valorem duties
which it imposes shall be converted into specific
duties within six months from its date, and these
are to be ascertained by making and average of
the prices for six months previous to that time.
The reverse of the proposition would be nearer
the troth, because a much larger amouut of re
venue would be collected by merely converting
the ad valorem dutiea of a tarifJT into equivalent
specific duties. To this extent tho revenue
would be increased, and in the same proportion
the specific doty might be diminished.
Specific duties would secure tho American
manufacturer the incidental protection to which
be is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff, and
to tbis surely no person would object . Tho
framera of tbs existing tariff have gone further,
and in liberal spirit have discriminated in favor
of large and useful branches of our manufac
tory s, not by raising tbe rale of duty upon the
Importation of similar articles from abroad, but
what is the same in effeot, by a luiiuing articles
free of duty which enter, into the composition of
tboir fabrics.
Under tbe present system it has been often
traly remarked that this incidental protec
tion decreases when the manufacturer needs it
most, and increases when be needs it least, aud
constitute a sliding scale which always oper
ates against bim. Tbe revenues of the country
ere subject to similar fluctuation. Instead of
approaching a steady standard as would be the
ease under a system of specific duties, they sink
and rise with the sinking and rising of prices of
articles in foreign countries. It would not be
difficult for Congress to arrange a system of
Specific duties wbicb would afford additional sta
bility both to our revenue an J our manufactures,
and without injury or injustice to any interest
of tbe country. This might be accomplished
by ascertaining the average value of any given
article for a aeries of years at the place of ex
portation, and by simply converting the rale of
ad vaUrtm duty upon it which mi:ht be deem
ed necessary for revenue purposes, iuto the form
of specific duty. Such so arrangement could
not injure tbe consumer. If be should pays
greater amount of duty one yt-ur, this would tie
counterbalanced by a lesser amount the next,
nod in the end the aggregate wuuld be the same.
I desire to call your immediate attention to
the nraaent condition "f the Treasury, so ably
etamrim nrecpntd bv tho Secretary iu his
report to Congress ; and to recommend, that
measures be promptly adopted to enable it to
discharge its pressing obligations. Tbe other
recommendations ot the report are well worthy
of your favorable consideration.
I herewith transmit to- Congress the reports
ct the Secretary or War, ot the Navy, or the
luUetos, aod of the Postmaster General. Tbe
ncommendbtioas and suggestions which they
contain are highly valo&bie ami deserve your
careful atteut ion.
The report of the Postmaster Genes aj details
the circumstances under which Cornelius Van
derbilt, on my request, agreed, in the month of
Jaj last, to carry the ocean mails between our
Atlantic and Pacific coast. Had be not thus
acted, tbis important inter-communication must
bave been suspended, at least fur a season. The
Postmaster General had no power to make him
oy other compensation than the postages on
t&e nail matter wbicb be might carry. It was
kjiawa. at the time, that these postages would
UU lar short of an adequate compensation, as
well as of the saw wbicb the same service bad
previoosly etui tbe Uoverumeot. Mr. Vauder
tilt, io eomnttfidsble spirit, was willing to rely
poo the justice of Congress to make up tbe
'deficiency; and I, therefore, recommend that an
appropriation may be granted for tbis purpoaa.
I should do great injustice to tbe Attorney

WEEKLY TELEGRAPH.
ASHTABULA:
SATURDAY MORNING, DECE'R. IS, 1860
New Secretary of the Treasury.
Ex Got. Thomas of Maryland, now a
the bend of the Talent Office, hns been ap
pointed Socretory of the Treasury, tine Mr.
Cobb, and hns accepted.
CoNOttRss. The transactions in cither bon?
of Congress hove not been of special interest,
The passsgo of tho homestead bill, and the
West Point and another minor appropriation
bill, with the appointment of d federal salvat'on
committee of one from a state, with Lorwin o
this state, chairman, is about tbe bulk of the pro
ceedings of a definite and positive nature. Mr,
Hawkins, of Fla. having refused to servo on
the committee, a great deal of regret coaxing, a
soft solder was put into operation by Mr. Cocb'
ran. of N. Y. to induce him to stand. Afte
allowing full plsy to the generous flow of so
licitude and concern, and appearing to grow
teuder under the melting operation, the bouse
voted not to excuso him, and than ho refused
to act II ilk, in the Senate after the reading
of the message characterized tho presidents
want of statesmanship and manliness, and said
that the logic of current events was submission
or force, which awakened a little smartness, but
soon died away. There hns been some bluster
about secession, but tho tone of congress does
not indicate a very great amount of alarm.
Compromise is alluded to, bat the south as
sume to care nothing for meanness of that
kind, and the Republicans, nlthough some ap
pear favorable, their conduct indicates that it
m jlit bo like the casting of pearls before those
animals we read of, into whom the devils en
tered. Another consideration is, compromis
iig is not populur among tho people. The
day for such things they pertinently Acll us has
gone bye. The north gains nothing by them,
and the south cares not a straw for them, only
so long as they are operative for good in its
favor. If there is no faith in the south :f
dismembermeut is determined upon, lutit come.
It my as well be met now, as at any other time,
The prospect is that S. Carolina will be suffered
to play with this snperanuated and imbecile
administration, to tho length of his tether, and
the worst state of things possible, bequeathed
to the new administration, to embarrass its
inauguration.
Senator Wade, it is said is preparing for a
speech, which will be- a tolling one upon sc
cession. Public attention is turned in that di
rection, and the views it contains will be sought
for with earncstne-s.
Docglas is also preparing for a demonstration
speech in the course of a few duj3.
TnuRLOW Weed's compromise feeler, which
it was said Mr. reward would back up, has
vanished into thin air.
II ow ia This ? We are informed by tele
graph that a messenger has arrived at Wash
ington from Sonth Carolina, bearing the elector
al vote of the State for President for the next
four yeaM, and the telegraph further informs us
that the messenger 'drew his psy for his services '
Mors Brooklyn Tiif.oi.ogy. While in the
Postoffieo (be other dny wo were informed that
another batch of the Yas Dvkb, God and slave
ry theolopy had been received, for, as we sup
pose, Ashtabula consumption. Iu channel of
communication is the .Vtt York Herald. A
fitness of things is always pleasing.
The Treasury is so hard up that it is feared
that the $1,500,000 interest due Januaiy lot,
in coin, will bave to be drawn directly from the
Mint The members of Congress are taking
certificates from tbe speaker and presenting them
at the treasury for their pay and mileage, instead
of waiting to receive it from the Seargent-at-arms.
In one instance tho threat of protest
had to be resorted to to bring down the need
ful. Such is the colapsed sta'e of the treasury.
The cointry now gathers nothing but the bit
terest fruits for its blind adherauco to bogus
Democracy.
Mobbing. A meeting of Garrison abolition
ists of mixed complexion am) sex, convened at
Tremout Temple, Boston, on the 3d inst., to
commemorate the death of John Brown. A-
mong those, present were Redpotb, Wendell
Phillips, Fred. Doughs, John Brown, jr., &c.
lue meeting was outnumbered by the conserva-
tives, who assembled too, and did succeed in
breaking up the meeting. The indicotions were
i-'flkieutly threatening to call out the police,
and hold the military ia readiness for action.
When these people were permitted in peace to
meet annually and resolve that the constitution
was a compact with bell, and voting was a sin
against God, it proved bov harmless amusement,
but if mob violence and perseoulion is to be
revived, who knows to what Importance they
short step between them and the Southern diso-
lutionists.
Tbe New Orleans True Delta charges that
the so-called Vigilance Committee of that city
who make it ao especial duty to bunt dowu wan,
dering Abolitionists from tbe North, is bogus
and tbst it consists of an irresponsible mob,
who take advantage of the exeitement of tbe
times to levy block mail oo respectable citizeur,
Tbe Delta intimates that unless these "roughs"
curb themselves a eoooter, baa file Vigilance
Committee will be formed, which will deal about
ss harshly with these black mailers as with tbe
blaok Abolitionists.
A Srsitcu it Ma.DoiGLAS.-Mr. Douglas Is
preparing to address the Seuats oo tbe present
emergency, and will take diatioet ground that
secession, involves war aud all iu calamities, and
that that fuel must bs confronted by tbs men
who ara now precipitating tbe cotton states in
revolution, lie thinks it wiser to face tbe
whole Issue, and let tbe people see the eooae
queuces, than tfl L!!pk it until the real crisis is

From the N. Y. Journal of Commerce.
Abolitionism Rampant Everywhere,
The Anti-Slavery agitation, since it connec
tion with the politics of the country, has wax
ed hot in certain ditdricta, to the exteut, even,
driving ministers of the Gospel from their
pulpits. Ity a letter from a most respectable
soarce, we learn that this has been the case io
Ohio. Tbe Rev. J. Mill Gillett, a faithful
clergyman or the 1 resnytermu Lhurch, was
worried out of Ms previous charge becnuso be
troud not preack aeatnit the $in of eUivn v.
from there lie went to Ashtabula, Uhio, and
became pastor of a Presbyterian Church (New
School) which ia represented as "a substantial
and conservative people, but, by tho working
and worrying of a few rampant, radicnl men,
who sought to apply him to their political uses
or drive him away, a "secession movement nas
been made." Our correspondent speaks of Mr.
Gillett as "u sound man of good tulenls, un
doubted piety aud devotion to true gospel prin
ciples." In this unholy war against the Church
and the ministry, which hug been led on by such
men as Theodora Parker, Garrison, Wendell
Phillips, &c, the low politicul press is found
sorootimca arrayed against the sober and earn'
est preachers of the eospcl. It Is so in this
case, as we are told that "one of the most active
and violent iu this war upon Hev. Mr. Gillett
is a wild Abolition editor of a paper in Ashta
bula," one of those "fanatic Englishmen' des
cribed by Kirwnn, who thus sets himself up as
a judge of what a minister shall preach, und on
what topics he shall discourse. The tendency
of such a course can easily be foreseen, enibit
teriog aociety and destroying the best interests
ot a community, under a pretense of serving a
righteous cuuso. Such men, while thry would
seem most religiously devoted to freeing the
blacks, are as eager to make t-laves of white men,
and especially to hold the church aud the minis
try in bondage.
There is no tyranny in the land more shamo
ful than this ; and these 'proposed lovers of free
dom come, thus, to be the most crncl slave driv
en. Arc there not some good men iu such
places as tho one here referred to. who will
stand up for the common rights of the ministry,
while they insist ou the rights of the slave?
Must all proper freedom in the church be tram
pled uuder foot, under the guise of making tho
Africans free T Observn, the case under notice
is not that the minister baa preached politics
offendinir a part of the concrecation by obtrud
ing his political sentiments upon them from the
pulpit. No 1 But that ho refuse to preach
politics, refuses to join in the raillery and slaug
of tho porty press. Observe, too, Satan does
not say : "AH this will I give theo if thou wilt
fall down and worship me." No 1 But "all
this will I damage thee, to the very death, if
thou wilt not Tall dowu and miuisicr to my par
ty cause."
We plcBd for the right of Mr. Gillett and of
all such to keep out of Iho-dirt and strife of
this arena; a we hope he will be sustained. L.
Tbe immortal Sam Patch has the credit of
giving utterance to the axiom, that "Some
things ca.i be done as well as others." Tbe
force of the proposition mny be seen in every
day life. It is true intellectually as well as phy
sically. What one feeble head cannot accom
plish, two may undertake with fairer prospccU
of success, illustrating at the same time, the
truth of that othar adage, trite, but forcible,
that "two heads are better than one, even tho'
one be a leather head." The editor of the X.
V. Journal of Commerce, in a mountain labor
with somo old fogy friend of ours the editor
finishing tho brains and the other the rancor
have brought to bear upon us the foregoing
fulmination. They have evidently acted upon
the Patch maxim, and the fervency with which
they Lave engaged in their work shows bow
much confidence they reposed iu the maxim.
Tho doctrine, however, admits of temporary
failure, a;;d renewed eOlit, and if poradveuture,
this well chosen effort should prove impotent
and unsuccessful, the field is still open. Aud
who cannot see that iu such a case, a more
formidable conclave could be enlisted and
brought iuto action, -and the combined energy,
moral force and strutcgy of the N. Y. Herald
and Olecrver, might bo added to that of the
Journal, in finding some vulnerable poiut in the
armor of this villago nchilles, where somo shaft
more lucky than tho rest could be mado to
penetrate. Tbe cause is an important one, aud
the emergency great. The means should be
adequate to the greatness of the end. A crca
ture of such proportions, striding like a coios-
s is over the heads of a whole community, ex
ertiog all tho prerogatives of "the most crnel
s'ace driver,' "trampling under foot all proper
rights of the church," "silting himself up as t
judge of what topics the sacred desk shall dis-
Courte npon," "embittering society, and destroy
ing tho best interests of community," and
"damaging to the very death" oh ! Jehosaphat
"those who will not minister to his party
cause," is au incarnation of power and evil, that
should uot be tolerated for a day. What folly
to recommend, as the Journal does, "pleading
fur the right," with such a despot. The tender
mercies of 6uch a monster, is cruelty, and to
sue for right, wonld be as ignoble unmanly, as
unavailing. Fogydom should be more in earn
est.. Nothing but extermination can bring peace
and tranquility to a suffering people. The quad
ruple alliance, therefore, if necessary, must be
entered into, and if the complete establish
ment of the doctrine we started with is not
shown, and the desired end attained, it wi.l
only be because the means for such an achieve
ment bave not all been tried. There willte
no reason for discouragement.
ccriousiy. jo inese remarks, and in copy
ing tho article they refer to, no disrespect will
be charged, we apprehend, towards the gentle
man whose name our cotcmporury bandies about
with such indiccreet ofTJciousuess, and from
whose obtrusively patrouiziug air, there is rea
son to believe, his soul shrinks with mortifica
tion. From such frieuds, he will, no doubt,
secretly, if uot openly, pray to bo delivered.
The Journal's vulor is of tbe most gallant
description. Its homilies about "making slaves
of white men," ore read with effect. It hag tho
advantages of experience. To be Bure, that ex
perience has been confined to a more limited
sphere than that cow chosen. Heretofore it
has been collected to confine its labors to its
own establishment, find, the fact of that office
having been built op from the unrequited toil
ot ita operatives from the sweat and weariness
of its uupaid white slaves, mode so by its grind
ing avarice, gives especial fluency and reeling to
iU admonitions in thia direction. If It has any
surplus piety to bless the world with, common
fame about New York would suggest its exer
cise at ita owo door.

The Speech of A. H. Stephens.
Mr. Stephen delivered a speech on Secession
the Georgia House or Representatives, oo
the 4th or Nov. I860, from which we take the
following extract :
If the policy t.f Mr. Lincoln and hi re
publican nssoi-intc shall be carried out, or
attempted to be carried ont, no man in
Georgia w ill be moro willing or rendy than
myself, to defend onr right, Interest and
honor at every hazard, and to the Inst ex
tremity. (Applnnso. )
What is thi policy f It is, In the first
place, to exclude us by en net of Congress
from tho Territories with onr slave proper
ty, llo is for using the power of. the Gen
eral Government ngainst the extension of
our institutions. Our position on this point
is and ought to be, at all hazard, for per
fect equality between all the States and the
citi.c.is of all tho States in the Territories,
tinder the Constitution of the United States.
If Congress should cxerciso it power a
gainst this, then I em for standing where
Georgia planted herself in 1850. These
were plain propositions which were then laid
dowD in her celebrated Platform as suffi
cient for the disruption of the Union if the
occasion should ever come : on these Geor
gia has declared that she will go out of the
Union ; and for these she would be justified
by the untions of the earth for so doing.
I say tho some ; I said it then ; I soy it
now, if Mr. Lincoln's policy should be car
ried out. I have told you that I do not
think his baro election sufficient cause; but
if his policy should bo carried out in viola
tion of any of the principles sei forth in the
Georgia Pint form, thnt would be such an
act of aggression which ought to be met as
therein provided for. If his policy shall bo
carried out in repealing or modifying the
Fugitive Slave law, so as to weaken its
efficacy, Georgia hns declared that sh will,
in the instant resort, disrupt the ties of the
Union, and I say so too. I stand upon the
Georgia Platform, and npon every plonk,
and sny if thoRe aggressions therein provid
ed for take place, I say to you, and to the
people of Georgia, keep your powder dry,
and let your assailants then have lend if
need be. (Applause.) I would wait for
an net of aggression. This is my position.
The policy of the Republican party is cer
tainty to exclude slavery from the Territories
by act of Congress, and Mr. Lincoln is pledged,
by his acceptance of the Republioan Nomina
tion, to carry ont these views, so far as he has
It In his power to do so. Mr. Stephens is fully
aware of these facts, and he might as well pro
ceed to act now, in accordance with his treason
able intentions, as to await any further develope-
monts upon the subject. Theie may be a Re
publican here and there scared out of his boots.
at the crazy threats of the South, but we ex
pect to see upon the slave question a bold and
determined front upon the part of the Repuh"
lienn party, in support of their Constitutional
rights.
S. Carolina. A letter published iu tho Tri
bune from a correspondent at Charleston, shows
that even in South Carolina there is a feeling of
opposition to the headlong course of tho men
who have olrcady;brought tbe state to the verge
of ruin. It is cot probable that S. Carolina
will be withheld from declaring her secession
from tbc Uuion, but it is probabta that the fiual
plunge will be delayed. Such is also said to be
the tenor of advices received by Mr. Buchanan.
In return for his exceeding kindness to the revo
lutionists, they are said to promise not to at
tack tho forts in tho harbor of Charleston, aud
not to refuse tho payment of duties until the
inauguration of President Lincoln.
Mr. Botts has written a strong letter against
Secession which takes the ground now more or
less common, even in the south, that Virginia
will submit to the constitution of tho U. States,
rather than to South Carolina.
Our country has incresed in sizo more than
three-fold since the closo of the revolutionary
war. The United States have a territorial ex
tent nearly ten times as large as that of Great
Britain and France combined. Tho American
Republic is one-sixth less in extent than the
area covered by tbe Cfty-nino empires, states
and republics of Europe.
The presidential electors for the several states
chosen in Nouember, assembled each in their
several state capitols on Wednesday, and formal
ly cast their votes for president. Their records
are dispatched to Washington by special mes
sengers, and there opened before Congress on
the 13th of February, and the grand result offi
cially announced.
Senator Latham of California impressively
declared 00 Monday the fidelity to the Union of
that state. She will remain a part of the pow
er which can and will build the I'aciGc Railroad.
This manifestation of the Senator forms a pret
ty conclusive reply to the prophecies of an in
dependent Pacific Confederacy of late ao cur
rent among those who are anxious for tbe totul
destruction of the preseut Federal Government.
California and Oregon Retcbxs. The
Pony Express, with San Francisco dates to
Nov. 21st, reached Fort Kearney on tbe 2d inst.
The election returns of California are not quite
complete. The total vote returned is 117,815.
Lincoln 38,646; Douglas 37,318; Breckinridge
33,357; Dell 8,467. Tbe vote or the state can
not exoeed 118,500. Lincoln generally conced
ed from 700 to 1000 plurality.
Returns from all the counties in Oregon give
Lincoln 318 maj. over Dreckiuridge. Douglas
ia number three iu the race.
Attornkv Gkn. Black in'a letter to the pre
sident ou tbe right of secession, holds thut
there is no legal way io which the territory of a
state can be entered by armed Federal forces
except io aid of the regular Federal officers io
tbe state. Aud where these bave ceased to ex
ist, and their place cannot be filled, Federal
troops can bave no mission or place therein ex
cept by invitation of the state author! .ies. The
authority to enforce tho collection of the reven
ue he asserts to be tbe unquestionable preroga
tive of the Oeoeral Government, after secession
ss.well as bofore, and nntil Congress shall remit
its control over the established ports of entry
In the seceding state.
Tub Union a Nlisancic. The Grand Jury
of Montgomery, Ala., have presentod the Union
as a nuisance.
Kansas Matt tag. We have received infor
mation from tbe scene of the late troubles to
the 7th lost. Large parties of troops from
Fort Leavenworth bad moved to Mound City,
There joiuing their force with one buudred and
eighty aica from Fort Riley, attempts were
made to arrest Jeuniaon, but neither Le nor
Montgomery could be foand. - The rumors of
Montgomery's entrenchment and resistance are
simply absurd. The Inhabitants of Moond
City snd vicinity were much excited, fearing
harsh treatment from tbs Federal authorities.
A Washington dlspatoh y Mmmediste ef
forts will bs mado to pass Mr. Morrill's Tsriff
bill, as tbe most effective mode of restoring con
fidence; securing revenue, snd srrestiogthe pre

wheels of Government will be stopped.'
t
Sf.ckssior in LoiisiAiiA.-The Governor, In his
message to the extra session of the Louisiana
Legislature, exhorts calmness snd deliberation,
llo says the election of Lincoln shows that the
Northern mind is poisoned sgainst the South j
that the wise counsels or our fathers are forgot
ten, and the fraternal remonstrances or the south

He recommends a Convention, and says Lou
isiana ought not to refuse to meet her sister
slavcholding states In council to demand, of tho
North the repeal of the obnoxious legislation,
and guarantees against future similar .measures
Ho says these questions should be met before
tbe inauguration of Lincoln, because the self-
respect and honor of the State does not com
port with her remaining under a Black Repub
lican President, recommends the erection of a
Military Board, and asks an appropriation of
half a million dollars for the purchase of arms
volunteer companies. The members are not
disposed to act hastily, but favor preparation
for any emergency.
Disunion. The transfer of the disunion
ngitation to Washington, for the most part
withdraws attention from the disaffected
states. The South Carolinians are less
rampnrt than they were a fortnight ago,
but profess to be equally determined, ond
there is no remaining doubt that their con
vention will havo declared the state out of
the Union by the latter portion of the month.
The government will be compelled to con
sider tho state still in tbe Union and to
proceed to collect the revenues and defend
the port of Charleston ns usual. If South
Carolinnns obstruct the legitimate action
of the federal government, the government
must perforce maintain its authority ond
punish treason and rebellion. This, accord
ing to the sound and sensible portion of the
president's message, will not be coercing the
state to remain in the Union, but merely
compelling the rebellious portion of its citi
zens, who ore equally citizens of the U. S.
and cannot repudiate that relation so long
as they remain on the soil, to iulGU the r
constitutional obligations, or rather to per
mit the officers of the generul government
to fulfill their duties. The president has
shown that seccession is an Impossibility, and
that name is actnally revolution. Not
withstanding his inopportune and pusillani
mous twaddle about the want of power in
the general government to coerce a seceding
state, ho will bo compelled, the momont
South Carolina takes any decisive action
involing tho assumption that she ia actually
out of the Union, either to resist it by the
force at his command or openly and shame
lessly to violate his oath of office. Neither
South Carolina nor any other state can go
out of the Liuoii without war, uuleas by
previous general consent and peaceful ar-
rangomtit of terms of separation between the
seceding states and the rest. When this
reasonable ond proper view of the matter is
fully comprehended by the people of the
bouth, they will see the ucccssity of restrain
ing South Carolina from ony overt net in
volving war. That state has gone too far
to begin to deliberate on her own account.
But if the other states w ill only come to
tho resolution, cs they are likely to, to go
out, if at all, peacefully and by general con
sent, it will Lc the end of disunion, not
only for this time but for future time.
The Cit.cu Case Decided. This trial,
which uttracted so much attention, has ter
minated nguinst the opplicatiou of Rurch

The Jury was out about one hour and a

teen days. The news wns received with
preat rejoicings by the friends of Mrs. Bnrch.
One hundred rockets were fired from the

Rook Mokkis Si Co., who have been bor

elated over the discovery, and mean to turn
it to account.
