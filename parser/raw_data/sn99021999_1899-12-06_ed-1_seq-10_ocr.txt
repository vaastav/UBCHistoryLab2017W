bles nnd a report from Ohio puttlnc the
condition of the croii of that Mtato at SO
| > er cent. The dcorrnso In Kuropcan stock' ,
with the small world's shipments last week ,
was taken by shorts as a further reason
for covering at present figures. In view of
the- European condition It was believed the
export demand Is almost certain to Im
prove. Primary receipts for today and yu--
terdny showed a decrease of 3,000.000 bu.
nmlnr last year. This visible , It was calcu
lated , had reached the end of the period ,
which has shown , almost without varia
tion , Increases dupresKlng to the price and
n further decrease was predicted for this
week. With this array of backing the mar
ket advanced steadily , becoming fairly ac
tive toward the clo-o. The llnal price lor
May was iS'JtytffCO c , a gain of % e over yes

ing : there was a persk.'tcnt demand and
little Inclination on the port of packers to

quirements. Local receipts , 5,000 head un

MOVEMKM'S OF STOCKS AND IIOMK1 ,
Iltnl Intlon the Order of Hit * Day on
Stoi'k market.
NEW YOHK , Dec. C. Today's events In
the stock market brought additional dis
couragement to those who had been at
tempting to maintain or advance prices of
( lecuritles. Liquidation was the order of
the day and many holders who have waited
for weeks on deferred hopes of the situa
tion clearing up and the bull market being
Inaugurated threw over their holdings to
day. The weakness was most apparent In
the Industrials and specialties , but the rail
road stocks were very generally sold.
There was some buying of Flocks last week
on the presumption of speculative profes
sionals that the president's message was to
bo u bullish document and Its publication
today brought pro tit taking from those
sources In the natural order of events.
The. paragraph of the message bearing
on the subject of Industrial combinations
was the ground of the special weakness in
the industrial department. Quite a number
of these securities are from 1 to 3 points
lower on the day. A slngltv lot of Unlti-d
States Milling preferred sold at 12. against
22U , the last preceding sale. This stock
sold on September 13 at 7SV4. Hut the prin
cipal influence In the day's wcakntas wns
the money situation. The spasmodic char
acter of the selling and the exceeding dull
ness of the Intervening periods rellected the
operation of loan contraction by the banks ,
the successive calling of loans throwing
blocks of securities upon th < > market , which
found no support awaiting them.
There were sonip slight signs of Hrmnoss
In the early deallnus , especially In Sugar
and swme of the railroad stocks. The trunk
lines remained comparatively Ilrm through
out , but the sllsht evidences of strength
elsewhere gave way to the general tide ot
weakness.
Call money reached S per cent early in
the day and receded to 6 before the close ,
but the easing of the rate did not bring
any strength to stocks In view of he general
outlook. Shipments of money are still be
ing made to New Orleans and the New
York exchange rate at Important interior
centers continues at a material amount.
Notwithstanding yo c.crday's disbursements
by the subtreasury of over $ SOOOoO on ac
count of bond redemptions that Institution
was a creditor at the clearing houne this
morning to the extent of over $20J,000. Its
gain from the banks since last Friday has
reached $1,653,000. The majority of the.
banks being still very near or below their
legal reserve requirements this shrinkage
In resources Is forclnir still further con
traction of loan liabilities. The tendency Is
Increased by the approach ot the annual
settlement period for corporations and
preparation for the special demand for
money which will be made by it upon the
supply.
Sterling rates again advanced today In
New York , Paris and IJerlln , notwithstand
ing a further oai Ing of the rate for call
money at the Encllsh center. The New
York rote Is now within a fraction of the
gold exporting point and It la palpable that
a stiff rate for money In the local money
market will hold It below- that point. The
close of the stock market was generally
easy and near the low point.
Prices of bonds declined in sympathy with
stocks. Total sales , par value , $1,260,000.
United States/ new 4s and old 4s , registered ,
advanced % nnd 5s % in the bid price. The
2s declined 1/4.
The Commercial Advertiser's London
financial cablegram says : The markets
here were idle nnd heavy today on appre
hensions of dearer money and heavier
South African shipments of gold. There is
porno expectation that the Bank of France
can be drawn on for the required .supply . ,
but the bank announces that it will not
ral = the rate this year unless the reserve
Is attacked. In certain quarters it is sug
gested that the Bank of England will sooi
raise Its discount rate to 7 per cent. Ameri
cans were lacking In backbone , but then

CATTLE There was a fair run of cattle
todpy , including some eight to ten loads of
fancy beeves shipped In to contest for a
premium. As Is very apt to be the caao
when there Is anything unusual going : on
In the yards operators seemed to be slow
about getting down to business. Everyone
went to look at the good cattle , and it was
very late before any attempt was made to
buy fat cattle. Sellers were all out earlv.
but buyers claimed that they were not
ready. When the market did open it was
extremely slow and plainly lower on all
except possibly the few cattle that lust
happened to please buyers. The fact that
there were more good cattle than usual on
sale enabled buyers to discriminate more
closely against the cattle that were not
well finished.
The market on the general run of cows
xnd heifers was SftlOc lower and slow , so
that it was late before a clearance was
; ffected. In some few Instances good heif
ers that just happened to take the eye of a
juver sold at about stpnilv rirlpps. hut thn
most of the offerings went at the decline
noted.
Only a few stock cattle and feeders were
offered on the market , and values on that
kind of cattle were not materially changed
from what they were yesterday. At the
same time there was not a very active
country demand , and a speculator remarked
that had there been many cattle In they
would have sold lower. Representative

It became evident to the heads ot the dn-
partments , responsible for their efficiency ,
that in order to remove these dlfllcultles
and promote efficiency and harmony , amend
ments were necessary. These amendments
were promulgated by mo In an order dated
May 29 , 1899. The principal purpose of
the order was to except from competltl/e
examination certain places Involving fidu
ciary responsibilities or duties of a strictly
confidential , scientific , or executive charac
ter , which It was thought might better he
filled either by non-competitive examlnn-
tlon , or In the discretion of the appointing
officer , than by open competition. These
places were comparatively few In number.
The order provides for the fllliiiK of a much
larger number of places , mainly In the out
side service of the War department , by
what Is known as the registration system ,
under regulation ! ! to ho approved by the
president , similar to thaje which have pro
duced mich admirable results In the navy
yardo ecrvlce.
All of the amendments had for their m ! n
object a more efficient and satisfactory ad
ministration of the appointment and estab
lished by the civil service law. The results
attained phew that under these operations
the public service has Improved and that the
civil service system Is relieved of many ob-
jectlonahlo features which heretofore sub
jected It to just criticism , tin administra
tive officers to the charge of unbusinesslike
methods in the conduct of public affairs-
As H Id the merit wystem has been greatly
strengthened and HH permanence assured.
H will be my constant aim In the adminis
tration of government In our new poses-
slons to muko lltnerw , character and merit
essential to appointment to office and to give
to the capable and deserving Inhabitants
preference In appointments.
