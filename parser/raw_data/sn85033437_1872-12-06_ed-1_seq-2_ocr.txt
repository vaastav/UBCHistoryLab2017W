The President's message was transmit

more in about forty-five minutes, which is
the shortest time ever attained with so long
a document. Twelve wires were used, and
the weather was favorable for working
purposes. There were 11, $30 words in the
message.
The President, in his. letter accepting
Gen. Horace Porter's resignation as an
officer of the U. S. A. and Private Secreta
ry, pays him a high compliment for his
services in war and peace. Gen. Porter
takes charge of the entire business of the
Pullman Car Company. It is a responsi
ble position and we hope may prove profit
able, as we know it will, laborious.
Associate Justice Nelson, of the Su
preme Court of the United States, retires
with full pay for life. Judge Nelson re
tires from the bench after twenty-seven
years in his present position and forty of
j udicial service in State and I? edcral courts
riie with all the honors as faithful and
able discharge of the duties of his position
can bestow.
A SUCCESSFUL RAILROAD MANAGES,
We see that the exhibit of the financial
management of the Memphis and Charles
ton "Railroad shows that for the past four
months the net earnings of that road, un
der the management of Capt. Jos. Jaques,
have increased one hundred and eighty
thousand dollars. This is at the rate of
one hundred and forty thousand a year, or
equal to six per cent on nine millions of
capital. This, be it remembered, is an In
crease of net earnings over the previous
management. It is a splendid exhibit and
shows Capt Jaques to be one of the very
first railroad men of the South.
OUR WORST ENEMIES.
There is a large landholder near one of
our
ne krhborins towns who owns one
thousand acres of fine land immediately
surrounding the place. One of its citizens,
pointing to it some days ago, said : "There
is a snlpndid tract of land, two-thirds of
which lies uncultivated. The owner re
fuses to sell it and has entailed it to his
children as far in the future as our laws
wilHpermit. A neighbor. near by hold
ing not quite so much, but equally as fer
tile land, ispursuiug the same policy."
"These men," said our informant, "speak
right out and say they don't want immi
gration. They propose to hold their lauds
and cripple us."
The town referred to is partly
hemmed in by such farmers
and it is scarcely necessary to say that
for the last six years hardly a single neAV
house has been built. If the exclusive pol
icy of the Chineso were carried out and a
huge wall built about that place over which
immigrants were not allowed to pass, a
more ruinous policy could not be pursued.
How many such landholders are there in
our State? How many men arc there
holding three or five times as much land
as they can cultivate, which they will not
sell and which is now lying idle? Can
not people understand that this is a crying
evil and one that does more to impede im
migration than anything else ?
We hear meu cry out for more manufac
tories. Just what we all want, we admit. But
where is the population to consume the
products of your workshops ? A foundry
is a poor investment when there is no de
mand for engines or machinery. Men do
not build manufacturing establishments
where there is no thrifty, growiug popu
lation to use their products. There must
be population before there can be shops.
Population is the basis upon which every
department of industry or trade must rest.
As well try to build a solid massive ware
house upon a foundation'of sand as to try
to build up a State, or .city, or manufac
turing interests without population
to sustain them. Of course every
industrial enterprise depends some
upon patronage from abroad, but un
less sparsely populated localities have ex
ceedingly rare and peculiar advantages for
manufacturing, such enterprises will al
ways seek the populated regions. Here
9 A w
we have great advantages, but the main
dependence of most manufacturing inter
ests must be upon local support. If Knox
" and adjoining counties bad four times the
population they have and this they
should have we would have four times
our present industrial interests.
To come to the root of our present trouble
then, we repeat, we must have more pop
ulation. To secure this we must force in
to market our idle lands. Our farmers who
hold twice as much land as they work
must sell part of it to good men. Such
men as we referred to in the beginning of
this article must be forced to sell their land
Their Chinese notions are against public
policy. They are our worst enemies. They
are keeping our people poor and our coun
try depopulated. If we had the power we
would tax all such lands so high that the
S2lfish, miserly owners would be compelled
to sell part or them. The industrious far
mer now helps pay taxes on these idle
lands. His enterprise and capital is taxed
three times as much as it would be if all
these waste fields were yielding abundant
crops through the labors of thrifty immi
grants. They can riot fail to see this. This
is one remedy for the evil now crippling
us, and though it.may not be the best, it is
worthy the attention of our Legislators
soon to assemble to devise some relief for
our embarrassed tax payers.
. .
COMMESIS ON I HE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
The comments of the press ou the Presi
aenvs message are on tne wnole very
favorable.
The Isew York Times savs. nothimr
could be more plain or business-like and
that not in twenty years has a President
been able to lay before the people a more
gratifying public exhibit.
The Herald (Ind.) pronounces it a good
message and a valuable State paper, brim
ming over with all the vast and multifa
rious concerns of the country, at home and
abroad. i : ' f ;i V A H : - T A -
The Tribune (Ind.) declares that it is a
plain, business document,- pressing some
mischievous old plans and presenting some
naur mioa i t . -
The Sun (Dem.) thinks it common-place
and conspicuously encourajriDjr every
measure looking towards centralization.
The World (Dem.) thinks the message
does not show the President far-sicrhted.
It pronounces hia recommendations as
"gathering up the tail ends of spent ques
tions." The Philadelphia Press says : No words
of ours need be added in praise of the
message, which is simply a calm review of
the nation's history in the last year, and a
clear statement of its necessities in the
next from the President's standpoint.
me Missouri ucmocrat says: it is a
plain, straightforward, business-like pa
per, comprehensive in its scope, and going
sufficiently into detail to convince the peo
pie or the nation that President Grant is
an honest, faithful and pains-taking guad
ian of the public interests.
The Chicago Inter-Ocean says of it : It
is marked by that straightforwardness of
statement which has characterized all the
messages and public acts of President
Grant, and adds to his reputation as a cau
tious, shrewd, far-seeing statesman, who
gains strength as he gains experience, and
giving promise of entering upon his second
term with deservedly largely increased
popularity among all classes of thejpeo-
ple.

"THE KECORD.
Prospectus.
The want of a religious paper, which should possess
certain well defined characteristics, has long been felt
in East Tennessee. Such a paper, it was seen, should
be so cheap that every family might take it ; yet so
high toned, fresh and.figorous as to be highly esteemed;
so local in character as to interfere with none of our
able religious weeklies, published abroad; and so ex
clusively religious as to compete with none ef our pro
gressive seeular papers.
It is proposed to meet this want by the publication at
Knoxville, Tennessee, of a paper called The Record,
which while especially under Presbyterian auspices,
shall sincerely aim to develop the religious interests of
East Tennessee. The news of all the churches and re
ligious bodies in our section will be thankfully accept
ed, and will be given as folly and impartially as 'pos
sible. The great aim will be to acquaint our churches with
one another and place our peotle in practical sympa
thy with the great religious movements and the earn
est Christian thought of the age. Politics will be en
tirely excluded. Nothing uncharitable or partisan or
controversial will be admitted, but only that which it
is hoped may promote the glory of out Lord Jesus
Christ, in whose name this enterprise is begun.
We desire to place the paper in every family in East
Tennessee, and to this end earnestly ask the co-operation
of every Christian worker. That cheapness and
excellence may be combined, it will be issued monthly,
but on good paper, and in the best style, and will con
sist of eight pages, large quarto. .
The first number will be issued early in January,
1373. Now is the time to subscribe.

Oar reason (for this is that we do not like to recommend a new thins; unless wo know it is good. Wewrre
oleased to find that the AsenL Mr. C. P. KniehtL wa nf our war of thinkicr. and wished above 1T. that ihp
paint should be tested, so that the editor could a-ivn h'
test made in our household, we hare no hesitancy in saying that the Enamel Taint comes up fully to all that i?
claimed for it. In the country, especially, where it is difficult to procure the necessary ingredients for mixing
paint, and skillful workmen to apply it, the Enamel Taint will prore invaluable, as it is already prepared, and
can be applied by any one possessing ordinary judgment. For plain work in private dwellings, churches and
sehool-houses it will prove very economical as weli as beautiful. One gallon of this paint will cover twenty
square yards, giving two c oats. Our friends may Eafely give it a trial without fear of d sappointment.

inside and out with "Bradley's Patent Enamel Taint." for which C. P. Knight. No. 3 Wet Lombard street, is
agent, and to testify to its superiority over any and all other paints for similar uses. In i rivate dwelling can
paint possibly be subjected to the very severe test it undergoes at this establishment, where, during our daily
cleaning, soap and soda are constantly applied to it, and yet it appears as sound and fresh as when first put on.
Of the numerous advantages it possesses over other paints I wil only mention its being mixed awl ready for use
in quantities.to suit purchasers: its quickly drying properties, which saves much time in the execution cf work
where paint is needed, and its very perceptible ten aeity. which imparts beauty and durability to the objects on
