those who are innocent of the folly
have to pay part of the penalty
incurred by those who are guilty of
folly. A panic brought on by the
speculative folly of part of the busi

permanent prosperity of the country
the High individual character of
average American citizen, no mat
whether his work he mental or
manual, whether he be farmer or
wage-worker, business man or profes

Talks on Corporations.
Corporations are the first great sub
ject dealt with. He says he is not
opposed to corporations. Like trade
unions they have come to stay. Each
must he checked when they are not
doing good. He thinks their regula
tion possible under existing conditions
hut if not the constitution must be
amended. The power to regulate must
affirmative and given to some ad
ministrative body created by congress.
says such a body should have the
power to judge of the reasonableness
a railroad rate and to prescribe the
limit beyond which it shall he unlaw
to go. All decisions on rates must
subject to revision by the courts.
He does not favor power being given
originate rates, but to regulate
rates already fixed.
"I regard the power to establish
maximum rate as being essential
any scheme of real reform in the
matter of railway regulation.
All private car lines, industrial
roads, refrigerator charges, etc.,
should be controlled by the commis
sion.
Labor Question Taken Up.
Again recommends compulsory use
of block signals on interstate railroads
and recommend regulation of hours
of railroad workmen and the liability
of employers for injuries. He says
would be unwise to deprive courts of
power of injunction in labor matters
Recommends thorough investigation
of labor matters, child labor, healthy
factories, reasonable hours.
He recommends consideration of
federal supervision of insurance. He
says the needs and desires of the
people should be consulted on tariff
matters.
Says economy in expenditures is ab
solutely necessary this year. Advises
the addition of the element of eiastic
ity to our currency.
He wants better business methods
in the various departments at Wash
ington. Also recommends supervision
of federal elections and campaign ex
pendit ures.
International Matters.
The various matters affecting inter
national law coming before tlie next
Hague convention are discussed at
length. He discussed the Monroe doc
trine as an aiu to the world peace and
in this connection the San Domingoan
situation.
Canal Funds Forthcoming.
The Hepburn bill, appropriating
$16,500.000 for the canal, will pass
the house Thursday without reference
to committee, either by unanimous
consent or by special rule.

BATTLESHIP IDAHO AFLOAT.
Successful Affair at Philadelphia Last
Saturday.
Philadelphia, Pa.—The battleship
Idaho slid off the ways at precisely
12:16 Saturday, and everybody agreed
that the affair was a huge success.
There was no hitch from the begin
ning to the end. Nothing marred the
program, and from the time the pretty
young sponsor. Miss Gooding, broke
bottle of champagne on the bow of
the vessel, as she slid in the water
graceful as a swan, until the last

French in the banquet hall nearby,
everything went like clockwork.
The launching was witnessed by the
greatest crowd that ever assembled at
the Cramp yards on such an event.

And listen _ln the snowy night
To hear his sleigh bells chime.
Beside the door ou Christmas eve
I put a truss of hay
To feed the prancing steeds
That sped him on his way.
pictured him a Jolly man
With beard of frosty white.
And cheeks so fat that when he laughed
They hid his eyes from sight;
heart that overflowed with love
For little girls and boys,
And on his back a bulging pack,
Brimful of gorgeous toys.
If children of a larger growth
Could have a Christmas tree
From Father Time, one gift alone
Would be enough for me—
Let others take the gems and gold,
And trifles light and vain.
But give me back my old belief
In Santa Claus again!

BY JULES ADAMS POWF.I.L.
he—our eldest child—our Henry—were
alive to-day, he would be a brave lad
I T was the day before Christmas.
Dame Yarrow stood in the store-room
doorway, gowned in a warm frock of
gray wool homespun, over which was
tied an ample white apron. Her
white-capped head nodded ns she counted
the pies on the shelves.
"Fifteen pumpkin—fifteen mince—fif
ty custard cups and two plum puddings
—eighty-two In all, not counting Nnn
Tiie's three little turnovers. 1 think that
will do for the holidays this year, though
Brother John is coming with those ten
boys and one little girl. How cold it Is.
There is surely a storm brewing, and I
hope the folks will get here before it
breaks."
The good woman turned the key In
the lock, and a door blowing open just
at that moment, at the other end of the
pasageway, she hurried off to close it
nnd forgot about the key.
By 3 o'clock madame was robed in
her pretty gray poplin with white ker
chief crossed on her breast, and a dainty
white lace cap on her brown curls,
which would stray out from beneath the
cop band, and which Papa Yarrow slyly
pulled as he passed through the hall
where sat his wife and little daughter in
front of the blazing wood fire.
"All ready for company, Nancy
mine?" He caught the little one up in
his arms and kissed her on either cheek,
continuing: "And mother, too? Why
she looks as young as the day I saw
her for the first time."
Farmer Yarrow put the little girl
down, glanced at his wife, who, with
drooping face, did not respond to his
merry speech. -
Her husband, noticing this, bent over
her tenderly, with the words, "Yes, my
wife, our life has ben one of great hap
piness, marred only by one sorrow. If
of 17."
"John," for the first time his wife
raised lier head and looked into his face,
her brown eyes filled with tears, "John,
sometimes, methinks our boy may yet
he alive. In the fight with the Indians,
we were told that he was carried away
by them, and even though the country
about was searched by scouts and others,
it might be that they saved his life, for
he was but a baby—5 years old, and if
there was a woman in that tribe surely
she would have mother-heart enough to
preserve the life of an inocent babe who
had never done harm to any."
"Wife, wife, this is very wrong for
you to hope for the return of one who
has been so many years from us. I am
sure that our son canuot be alive, or we
would have heard of him in some way.
Ah! I hear sleigh bells."
Catching Nannie up again, he turned
toward the window, and coming up the
driveway were seen three immense
sledges drawn by strong horses and filled
with merry faces, the owners of which
were soon clambering out. The front
door was thrown open, nnd Madame
Yarrow's tears vanished in the hearty
handshakings nnd embraces of sisters,
cousins and aunts.
Even Great-grandmother Hartwell
had come, for this year It was Mary
Yarrow's Christmas feast, and all had
come to make the old house ring with
joy nnd laughter until after New Year.
That night a merry crowd eat down at
the supper table. There was Brother
John Hartwell, his wife and eleven chil
dren. There was Great-grandmother
Hartwell and her daughter-in-law.
Grandmother Hartwell. Mr. Yarrow's
father nnd mother were present, as were
also his two brothers and one sister with
their wives, husband nnd children. In
all there were thirty-three.
One might well wonder where all this
goodly company were to sleep, but If you
had gone into the great garret you would
have censed wondering, when you snw
the trundle beds for the little ones. Of
course, the very smallest babies slept in
i " lot ' iers rooms.
Christmas Eve the children were al
ways allowed an extra half hour around
the fireside to listen to the stories of
their elders, while the corn popped and
chestnuts burned black, or else hopped
across the floor.
On this evening Nannie sat in her
' favorite place on Cousin Roderick's knee,
j ^nele Tom had just been saying that a
j few days previous he had heard that
J the Indians had been causing trouble
for the farmers. They were stealing
the hoarded corn and wheat, and in one
; j nsta
ince, after taking the grain, they
had set fire to the granary.
Cousin Rod saw the look of terror in
the eyes of some of the little ones, and
Interrupted with the words, "Well,, now,

there for to-morrow?
"Are they really so hungry, Cousin
Rod?" asked a little voice from his lap.
"Yes, dear, an Indian is always ready
to eat one out of house and home."
• •****
Late that night no one heard the
At the same instant a tall, dark form,
that had but a moment before climbed
into an unfastened window, stood trans
fixed with fear at the figure before him,
but for the moment only, when, with a
sort of grunt, the man moved toward
the pantry door.
Nannie, beneath her breath, whispered,
"It's a Indian, an' he's come for my
turnovers. Cousin Rod said he might."
She was frightened and stood very still
while the other fumbled with the lock, *
which soon yielded, and when Nannie
saw the man was really inside the pan
try, she turned and almost flew back to
her father's room, where, standing on
tiptoe, she whispered in his ear, "Fath
er! Father! A Indian is down in the
storeroom, stealiu' my turnovers! Come
quick, father!
He did "go quick," and arrived just in
time to close the door of the storeroom,
and turu the key in its lock.
There was a pause, then a pounding
on the door. Hastily pushing a heavy
table against it, Mr. Yarrow returned
to his room; dressed, and calling two
other male members of the household,
they all marched to the storeroom well
armed, and without much trouble, soon
overpowered the thief, who proved to
he uu Indian, and who mumbled some
thing that sounded like broken English.
They carried him out to the smoke
house. which was built of stone, and
had a heavy iron door. The three men
watched nearby the rest of the night.
At breakfast on this Christmas morn
ing. Father Yarrow told the story of the
previous night, and Nannie had her full
share of caresses and praise from aunt
ies, uncles and cousins alike.
Then there was a clamor from the
youngsters to "see the prisoner;" so after
breakfast they nil went forth to the tem
porary jail, Dame Yarrow among the
others.
The great doors were pushed back,
nnd lying on the floor was the Indian,
nsleep. Rut was it an Indian? Instead
of the straight black hair, his was brown
and curly.
Dame Yarrow gave one look, then
turned to her husband, with extended
hands, and the cry, "Oh, John, it is he!"
fell fainting into his arms.
The lad was awakened and taken to
the house. He spoke English brokenly,
but could give no account of his former
life, before he became one of a tribe of
half-friendly Indians.
He explained his being in the store- ^
room by telling his hearers that his
tribe of Indians that was encamped sev
eral miles above, on the river hank, had
been living on what they could steal from
the whites.
He had hen sent out on this night,
and seeing a window open in the hack
of the Yarrow homestead he determined
to craw 1 in and view the premises.
Mrs. Yarrow knelt before him and
gazing searehingly into his eyes, which
were blue, asked over and over, "Don't
you know me, Harry, darling? I am
your mother." But lie could not be
made to understand. He begged leave
to return to the tribe, saying he would
come back again with information.
This the men were inclined to believe
a trick to get away, but when Mrs. Yar
row pleaded for him they let him go.
All idea of church-going was aban
doned, for the first time on Christmas
Day in the life of any member in that
household, and dinner awaited at the
bidding of madame until the return of
the youth. He was seen coming up the
walk at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and
with him was an old Indian.
The following tale they all listened
to with great interest:
"In the great Indian fight of twelve
years before, the little captured boy was
taken to the Indian encampment, and
given to the care of a young squaw, the
favorite wife of the chief of the tribe.
"One day she overheard the chiefs
talking about the white man's child.
They said he had brought misfortune
to the Indians, as they had lost several
battles since he had been with them, so
they had decided that the innocent child
should die.
"The squaw had learned to love the
little one. That night she arose, and
taking him in her strong arms she car
ried him away to another tribe of In
dians, who were bitter enemies of her
own, and, In order to save the boy's
life, she told the chief of a deep-laid
scheme that her tribe had planned for
attacking them.
"She asked them to take the child and
keep him. till perhaps, some day he
would be restored to his "white tribe.' "
The old Indian was well rewarded
with a load of wheat and corn to carry
borne on a hand sled.
Then the long-lost Harry Yarrow was
made to understand that this was his
home, and that he was to remain there.
The Christmas dinner did not suffer
that night for want of attention, but
before they partook of it, Farmer Yar

ed God for this greatest of all His bless

An Improved Diary.
"This," explained the bookseller, "is
our latest patent diary. We think it is
the cleverest thing in that liue ever de
vised."
The shopper turns the leaves idly.
"But I can't see where it is different
from any other," she observes.
"No? Well, if you will look at all
the dates after Jan. 23 you will see that
in each space has been printed, 'Got up,
ate breakfast, lunch and dinner and went
to bed.' That insures a complete diary
for the year."—Judge.
The Dawn of Christmas.
Christmas day begins in the middle of
the Pacific ocean, and there is where
Santa Claus starts and ends his great
and only journey of the year.
