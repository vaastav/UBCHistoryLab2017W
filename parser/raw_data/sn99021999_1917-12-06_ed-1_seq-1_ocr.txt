LATE WAR
BULLETINS
GERMANS TAKE HILL.
Berlin. Dec. 5. (Via London.)
Austro-German forces yesterday cap
tured some hill positions in the Sette
Comuni, on the mountainous front in
northern Italy, the .war office an
nounced today. The text of the state
ment reads:
"Troops, of Field Marshal Conrad
von Hoetzendorf have taken from the
Italians some of the hill positions in
the Sette Comurri.
Use German Ships.
Rio Janeiro, Dec. 5. A decree
authorizing the signing of an agree
ment with the French government for
the use of 30 former German ships is
published by the newspapers. A state
ment issued by the finance minister
places the total tonnage of these ships
249,500. , ' -,, i
" Extend to Roumania.
Berlin, Dec. 5. (Via London.)
The negotiations between the Ger
mans and Russians for an armistice
are extending to the Roumanian
troops, the war officl announces.
Unofficial dispatches from Berlin
on Monday carried a rumor current
there that the Roumanian government
had -sounded Berlin and Vienna re
garding conditions for an armistice
tad peace pourparlers. There has
been -no confirmation of 'this from
non-German sources.
Roumania's troops on their battle
line have been dependent upon Rus
sian support of their flank to the
north, and a cessation of, hostilities
by Russia would leave them exposed
Jo a separate attack with almost in
evitable envelopment and destruction,
isolated as Roiimania is from her
western allies. A
Washington, Dec. 5. The Russian
ambassador has returned to the treas
ury the $5,000,000 given to him for. ad
vance to Roumania.
It was explained at the Russian
embassy today that it was impossible
to have the money changed into
rubles by the Russian State bank at
Petrograd. The original plan was to
have the Russian ambassador here re
ceive the funds in dollars and then to
issue an order on the Petrograd State
bank to transfer to the Roumanian
account the value in-rubles. Today's
reports of the Russo-German armis
tice extending to Roumanian troops
probably will defer disposition of the
money. v" -
Austrian Seaman Arrested
On Suspicion of Barratry
Seattle, Dec. 5. Carl Wiltsche, an J
Austrian seaman, was under arrest
today as the result of a federal inves
tigation of the stranding of the
Alaska passenger steamer .Spokane
off Idol Point, B. C., November 22.
Wiltsche was a member of the Spo
kane's crew. Federal agents refused
to disctfss Wiltsche's arrest or con
firm reports that other arrests are
contemplated as a result of investi
gation of the recent wrecks in Alas
kan waters of the steamers Al-Ki,
Manhattan, Mariposa ,and Spokane.
Foreign . Press Comment
Straightforward Message Gives No
Ground for Militaristic Illusions.
On President's Message
London, Dec. 5. President Wilt
son's message to congress Tias the
fullest possible prominence in the
morning newspapers, but it reached
London too late for much considered
comment. The Daily News receives
warmly the president's declaration
that peace should be based on gener
osity and justice to the icxclusion of
selfish claims. It adds: .
"It would be affectation to pretend
that this language echoes the declara
tions of the European spokesmen of
the allianCe. It is the voice of a
statesman whose vision comprehends
the world, while theirs comprehends
only half a world.

London. Dec. 5. The British

and sunk, according to the morning
papers. Eighty passengers and the
crew of the vessel perjshed. ykbout
120 passengers were saved.
It is' reported that the submarine

rescued,, but the submarine fired a
second torpedo while the women and
children were being lowered to the
boats, causing the ship to sink imme
diately with 8Q passengers and the
crew.
The Daily Mail appends to its story
the names of some prominent U-boat

1 This is the first report of fighting
by Russians since negotiations for
an armistice between Germany and
Russia were begun. The Russian
troops on the northern front have
been inactive for weeks, but the army
on the Caucasus front has been car
rying forward the campaign against
the Turks.
Quiet on Turkish Front.
The Russiairforces in Persia, near
the Mesopotamian border, have done
little since the Russian revolution,
however, and the lessening of their

effected. ' "
Speaking of the German attacks on
the British sa'.ient in the Cambrai
area. General Mauri c said:
"The enemy has toa certain extent
got us into an awkward position and
some adjustment of our lines may be
necessary. We may have to make
slight withdrawals on the north of
the salient. '
Von . Ludenorff Active,
"There is little doubt," continued
General Maurice, "that the latest Ger
man attacks 'in the Cambrai sector
have been planned and superintended
by General von Ludenorff himself,
Von Ludenorff a plan was a thorough

plans are. It was an attack on both

attack in force on the center.

jSAVIHB OF FOOD
IS 0ISCUSSE0 BY
COUNTY OFFICIALS
Gather From Many Sections of
the State to Confer With
State Food Administrator
on Many Matters.
More -than 60 county food adminis-
trators who gathered in Omaha yes
terday for a conference with State
Food Administrator Wattles, went
home with much definite information
regarding the co-operation ,of all
lines, in the state- toward conserving
the- food' supply and carried definite
instructions how to organize effective
committees of their own for the local
work. t, 1
So many representatives of! various
lines of industry and representatives
of important state conunittces and
organizations were present to give
specific information that the day was
like a day spent in a great school.
Miss Julia Vance, director of home
economics of the University of Ne
braska, and of the state food ad
ministration, told the assembled com
mitteemen that according to an ac
curate survey made, the averag
human being is consuming 247 per
cent more fats than the system necds
or can make use of. She told them
that the average Airtcrican is eating
49 per cent morem eat than his sys
tem needs or can make use of.
Dairy Herds and Milk Supply.
Prof. J. IT. Frandscn of the Uni
versity of Nebraska, department of
dairy husbandry, and Robert McGin
nis, Lincoln, of the state dairy com
mittee, pointed to the importance of
increasing dairy herds and the milk
supply.
George Coupland, vice chairman of
the State Council of Defense assured
the county chairmen of the full co
operation of the council in all matters
which should come within their juris
diction. . ,
Mr. Wattles in the afternoon went
into the price fixing situation at con
siderable length. He said that the
price fixing will be arranged ou the
cash and carrying business basis. lie
said an extra charge would be ordered
for delivery, ro that those who buy
artd-tarry thetr bwri purchases home
will get the advantage of that act. lie
said a distinction would be made In
the prices between cash and credit
purchases; that flour and sugar would
be touched first, and, perhaps, corn
meal, in the price fixing, with oat
meal, butter, eggs and other staples
quickly following.
To Increase Hog Supply,
' C. W. Pugsley of the University
Extension department, and chairman
ofj the sub-committee on live stock
production, said the committee hopes
to encourage hog breeders to in
crease the hog supply in the state
by 25 per cent at least, and that the
farmers are being urged not to' sell
hogs under 300- pounds, as it has
been calculated, the price of feed
considered, that a hog will continue
tO( grow into prpfit until it has at
tained at least that weight. '
Dr. George H. Cotidra, director of
soil survey, University of Nebraska,
reviewed the work of his department,
which is surveying the soil condi
tions in all aprts of the state, and
recommending the crops best adapted
to the various sections. He said the
sugar crop of Nebraska is 140,000,
000 pounds annually and that this
could very easily be doubled hi the
state.
Increasing the Live Stock.
W. B. Tagg of Omaha, president
of the Soukh Omaha live stock ex
change, and member of the live stock
committee of the food administra
tion outlined the plans of the com
mittee to boost increased production
of live stock, prevent the cutting of
the price too low" to make it profit
able for the breeder to raise his
stock and-at the same time aid in the
proper redistribution of the stock
throughout the . country so as to
bring thin stock and vaailable feed
always together.
Much of the morning session was
taken up with a technical discussion
of the Torrens system of land regis
tration. .
Countyhighways and the cost of
constructing county bridges were dis
cussed during the afternoon.

- After four days of effort 'which brought them but maU
gains of terrain at a great cost in casualties, the Germans have
not renewed their efforts in the Cambrai sector. .
The British salient there, however, is still a menace to the
security of the German lines north and south vof Cambrai and
the German artillery bombardment is probably but the prelude
to further desperate efforts to wipe out the gains made by Gen

NEW OFFENSIVE
FORESHADOWED
BEFORE ASIAGO
Germans Massing Great Forces
of 'Men and Guns and v
Heavy Bombardment
Going On.
. BULLETIN.
Rome, Dec. 5. Enemy forces have
begun an attack n the Italian lines
on the Asiago plateau, the war office
announced today. The only gains
achieved in the attack were some po
sitions the loss of which ,has, not im
paired the Italian defensive line.
Italian Army ' Headquarters in
Northern Italy ' Tuesday, Dec. 4.
Great forces of men and guns have
been massed by the Austrlans and
Germans in the Asiago section, ac
cording to reports reaching here to
dav. and resumotion of the offensive
is expected. The reports indicate that
tne enemy is employing 10 divisions
of troops. . ,
'. Heavy Bombardment.
An exceptionally heavy 4 bombard
ment from the enemy positions around
Asiago last night and through the
early hours today appears to iore
shadow the long expected resumption
or the heavy enemy offensive from the
north. The cannonade, was of ex
treme violence, the enemy using
heavy as well as middle caliber guns.
J The first violent eruption began
early last nighty There was a lull to
ward midnight and then it was re
sumed with added intensity at 3
o'clock this morning, lasting until 9.
Heavy shells were rained on the whole
range of Italian positions and were
concentrated partfcularly on the loca
tions supposed to shield Italian bat
teries. The violence of the artillery
action left little doubt that it was a
prelude to infautry advances in force,
whereby Field Marshal Conrad von
Hoetzendorf, who is directing the
Austrian forces in this rector, hopes
to realize his project of pressing down
the Astico valley leading to Vivenza
and the open plain. '.,
The latest reports show that the in
tense bombardment', continues. " The
indications arc that this. is something
more than a demonstration" or feint
and signals a new and strong offen
sive. , ,
Aviators Gather in Italy.
Among the troops and units hat
have arrived in Italy with the British
and French armies is a large group
of aviators who are impatiently wait
ing to get iijto action. The British
have sent a large contingent of flyers,
half, of whom arc young Canadians
and Americans, who have been doing
scout work in FJandcrs and northern
France. '..'
The squadron, which expects, to be
given work at the front very soon,, is
proving quite an attraction for the
Italians. While awaiting orders the
flyers are keeping themselves in trim
and the natives in fascinated delight,
by practicing over the town where
they are billeted. There i scarcely
an hour but that the hum pf at least
two and generally four or more mo
tors is heard above the town, and ev
ery public square is filled with crowds
gazing upward as the young aviators
bank and slide and spiral and twist.
The British aviators apparently arc

the electric light company for the
time being to act as office manager
of the Red Cross campaign, spied
Vo5s waiting at the window and ap
proached him.
"What can.v.c do for you?" asked
Davidson.
. "I want to get this check cashed,"
responded Voss, as lie held out a
bank slip for Davidson's inspection.
Whereupon the electric light man
proceeded to inform Voss that the
bank had moved a block down the
street and then began a big league
sales talk, to which Voss completely
succumbed, and when the Millard
man left the office Davidson had $1
of his money and the name of William
Voss, Millard, - Neb., down on the
books as a member of the Red Cross.
British artillery yesterday broke up
enemy troop concentrations east of
Gouzeaucourt and near Moeuvres, on
the southern and northern, legs pf the
salient, respectively, and the' Germans
violently shelled the region of La
Vacquerie, the center of much of the
fighting activity of the last few days.
GERMAN PLANS BIG.
That the German purpose may have
been to break ' through into the
Sonnnc region as well as to blit out
the Cambrai salient, is indicated in
dispatches from the front. But the
efforts have been futile and caused
such losses that the letup in the fight
ing activity probably is due to the
necessity for reforming the attacking
forces. . i .
Isolated enemy attacks along, the
northern Italian front have been
checked by the Italians, but the Aus-tro-Germans
have not attacked again
in force. Troop movements continue
behind the enemy lines and the Ital
ian artillery is busily shelling, them.
I The Austro-Germai. artillery hat
been busy in the Asiago region. Tin
enemy attempts, broken up by the
Italians, were in the Giudicaria region
west of the Brenta and between th
Brnita and the ria.vc. ... A ,
Eighty, passengers and the crew ol
the British steamer Apapa, of 7.8JJ
tons, were lost when the vessel was
torpedoed and sunk by a German sub-'

marine fired on open boats containing
women and children. About 120 pas
