A
HOUSE COMMITTEES.
Where Soma Congressman Are Liable to
lie Assigned.
Washington, Dec. 10. .Speaker Crisp
has not yet announced the c ommit te on
rules, which he must do before cor.reH
adjourns for the. holiday recess, if ho
would have the full list of committees
ready to submit to the house ujioii the
reassembling in January. The impvos
Bion still prevails ircnerally that Mcsora.
Springer and MeMillin will be tlio Dem
ocratic associates of the speaker on that
committee, but no official sanction has
been given to it yet.
It is altogether likely that Mr.
Mutchler, of Pennsylvania, will be put
en the committee on appropriations, the
place he had in the last congress.
Mr. Iteilly, of the same state, will
probably be assigned to the world's fair
committee.
Mr. Wilson, of West Virginia? who
was a member of the committee on man
ufactures of the Fiftieth congress, will
go back to that committee, as lie is well
equipped for the work. In addition to
this he will be given a first class place
on one of tho two main committees, or a
chairmanship.
Many of the northwestern Deinocvats
are urging the appointment of Mr.
Mitchell, of the Fourth Wisconsin dis
trict, for the chairmanship of the com
mittee on military affairs. Mr. Mitclu.il
was a colonel in the late war, and is a
member of the board of managers of tho
home for disabled volunteer soldiers,
and has always taken an active interest
in military affairs, lie is a new mem
ber and not asking anything, but his
friends are presenting his name to the
speaker and urging his selection.
Mr. Hatch will probably be given tho
chairmanship of the committee on agri
culture which he held in the last Demo
cratic congress.
Mr. Long, of Texas, is well known in
agricultural affairs and is president of
the Texas State Grange. His preference
naturally lies in tho direction of the
committee on agriculture.
Mr. Bailoy, of the same state is one of
the new members, well equipped for any
place that may bo off ered, but modestly
asking nothing. Judgo Culberson has
requested Mr. Crisp to give Mr. Bailey a
good assignment for the people of Texas
to look upon him as one of the young
men in this congress who will be of
great benefit in tho counsels of tho
party.
CONGRESS.
Sen ut i'.
Washington, Dec. 10. In the senate
Tuesday the report of the geodetic sur
vey was presented.
The vice president appointed Senator
Morrill regent of the Smithsonian insti
tution to till a vacancy.
Mr. Proctor introduced two bills to in
crease the efficiency of the army and to
regulato promotions. Mr. Cullom a
hill to amend the interstate commerce
law: to provide for the adoption of some
kind of automatic car coupler for feiyht
trains. Mr. Hoar spoke of the necessity
for congressional actum on this car
coupler question.
Air. Quay offered a resolution for an
inquiry as to tho feasibility of purchas
ing the states of Sonora, Chihuahua and
Cohuila, Mexico.
After a largo number of other bills
had been introduced the senate adjourn
ed until Wednesday.
No Strike, Says Carnegie'.
New Yokk, Dec. 10. Andrew Car
negie says there is no truth in tho re
port that the !i,500 men employed in the
Homestead mills, at I'ittsburg, intend to
go on a strike soon. 1 10 also denies that
the ground purchased at DnQiiesTio was
bought for tho purpose of putting up
ships where armor can be made. Mr.
Carnegie says tho firm has a three years'
contraot with tho men which does nt
expire until July I, next, and he dues
not, therefore, see how the men can
strike. Tho land at DuCuesne was pur
chased, ho says, with a view of future
extensions of tho works. Some blast
furnaces may bo built there soon, but
that is all the use will be made of the
laud for some time to come.
Stabbed Their Teachers,
ST. Albans, W. Vu., Dec. 10. Charles
Hess and Font Duval, boys of sixteen,
quarreled at school hist Friday and Ness
stabbed Duval fatally. On the same day
James Jarvis, a boy, resisted Professor
Eddy and in n tight cut Eddy four times
with a penknife. At Belmont, near here.
Professor Clarence Singleton was stabbed
five times yesterday, by one of his pupils
whom he had whipped on Friday. Tho
professor was frightfully bruised by
kicks. The condition of young Duval
and Professor Eddy is very serious.
Two llrolhers Asphyxiate d.
ClIIOAOO, Dec. 10. John and Henry
Fitzpirnmons, brothers, who recently ar
rived from Buffalo in search of work,
were found dead in bed at their board
ing house, H Townsend street. Monday
morning, and their room was full of gas.
An examination of the gas jet showed
thnt it was turned on full, and that on
retiring the previous night one of the
brothers had hung his trousers on the
jet, and in doing so probably turned tho
ga on, as the cock was very easily
turned.
Mm. llliilnc's Hlvorcc Suit.

James G. Blaine, Jr., in thecircuit court

Strong Men.
Women love strong men. A weak
man may excite their sympathy and a
woman's careful tenderness soothe and
soften the anguish of a weak man's
soul, but the laughing, joyous, warm,
exhuberant love of women dear be
longs to the men that are strong aud
noble and kind. Then why will a
man continue weak, anil mean and
peevish.
An old gentleman writes : "B. B.
B. gives me new life and strengh. If
there is anything that will make an
old mau young, it is H. B. li."
Homo men say, and women too,
they never feel weak and mean except
in the spring. Why then feel weak
and mean and nervous and prostrated
in the spring time when life and spirit
awakens with thrilling buoyancy even
the vegetable world ? Must you allow
sluggish blood, inactive organic func
tions, rusty joints and general weak
ness to make your life miserable simp
ly because the long winter has re
strained your natural activity? It
need not be. If only you will see the
pleasant aud incomparable tonic blood
nurifier known as B. B. B., or Botanic
Blood Balm your health in spring
time will be all that you cau wish.
Try it this spring. Try it now.
P. A. Bhepherd, Norfolk, Va., Aug.

taken according to directions will,
we believe, eflect a cure in any ordina
ry case and save the expense of large
doctor bills. Especially do we rec
ommend it in families where children
are threatened with croup, as it will
afford immediate relief, if taken in
time, which can always he done if the
medicine is kept on hand, as we are
convinced that It should be." For

It Is Pleasant to tha Tasto as tha Sweetest Nectar.
It is Safe and Harmless as tho Purest Milk.
Tills wonderful Nervine. Tonio has only recently been introduced into

qualities hitherto unknown to tho medical profession. This medicine hjw
completely solved the problem of tho cure of Indigestion, Dyspepsia, Livw
Complaint, and diseases of tho general Nervous System. It also ourci all
forms of failing health from whatever cause. It performs this by the Qrwt
Nervine Tonic qualities which it possesses and by its great curative powv
upon the digestive organs, the stomach, the liver and the bowels. No remedy
compares with this wonderfully valuable Nervine Tonic as a builder an4
Btrengthencr of tho life forces of the human body and as a great renewer ef
a broken down constitution. It is also of more real permanent value in tk
treatment and cure of diseases cf tho Lungs than any ten consumption nm
edies ever used on this continent It, is a marvelous euro for nrntinmm
of females cf all ages. Ladies who aro approaching tho critical period knowm
as change in life, should not fail to use this great Nervine Tonio alnntl

As a cure for every class of Nervous Diseases, no remedy has been AH
to compare with the Nervine Tonic, which is very pleasant and hanalws li
11 its effects upon the youngest child or tho oldest and most delicate inliviAV
ual. Nine-tenths of all the ailments to w hich tlie human family is heir, are
dependent on nervous exhaustion and impaired digestion. Yfhen there a M
isufficient supply of ncrvo food in the blood, a general state of debility tf
iio brain, spinal marrow and nerves is the result Starved nerves, Iib
Carved muscles, become strong when the right kind of food is supplied, a4
thousand weaknesses and ailment) disappear as the nerves recover. As Ae
uervous system must Bupply all tho power by which the vital forces ol fee
body are carried on, it is the first to suffer for want of perfect nutritioa.
Ordinary food does not contain a sufficient quantity of the kind of nutrimeil
necessary to repair the wear ouc present mode of living and labor Imposei
upon the nerves. For this reason it becomes necessary that a nerve food be
supplied. This recent production of tho South American Continent bos bte
found, by analysis, to contain the essential elements out of which nerve tissee
is formed. This accounts for its magic power to euro all forms of nervtse
derangements.
