Meetings of tne Board of
Agriculture
The State Board of Agriculture
hold two meetings in the county next
week. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
Dec. 10 and 17. at Irasburgh, on
Thursday and Friday, Dec. 18 and 19,
at Craftsbury. We have not
received the program in season for
this paper, but it vill be such as to
make the meetings of much interest
to all farmers and citizens. The
Hoard has been reorganized and is
composed of gentlemen, who are
practically as well as scientifically in
formed in the subjects to be discussed.
They are for the greater part men
who own and run farms and who
have been selected because they know
what they talk about. We think the
farmers in Vermout, many of them,
make a great mistake iu not attend
ing aud hearing these meetings.
It
must be a pretty stupid man and a no
toriously poor meeting if a farmer can
not see enough and learn enough in
one of these gatherings, to make it
profitable for him to attend. Vermont
must wake up in her farming interests
and it behooves her people to make
the most possible of every opportu
nity to learn something of the sci
ence and the approved methods in
agriculture. The world moves ; the
wooden plow has been superseded ;
the best methods of old have given
place to the better methods of the
present. A man in this age must
study, read, think, know, or he will
certainly get left. We hope these
meetings will be well attended.
The President's Message.
The following is a synopsis of the
president's message :
To the Senate and House of Rep
resentatives : The vast and increas
ing business of the government has
been transacted by the departments
during the year with faithfulness,
energy and success. The revenues
have been collected and disbursed
without a single case of defalcation
or embezzlement, and the work of all
public otlicers has almost wholly es
caped unfavorable criticism. The
credit of this good work is shared by
department heads with their subordi
nates. The ciose scrutiny of con
gress is invited to all administrative
methods and expenditures.
Our friendly lelations with Europe
and eastern uations have been undis
turbed, while our ties to the states
of the western hemisphere have been
strenghtened by the important convo
cation of independent states of the
American continent, held in the capi
tal, from October, 1880, -till last
April, pursuant to congressional in
vitation. This convention makes an
influential epoch in the history of the
western hemisphere. Its recommend
tions were transmitted to congress at
the last session.
The president refers to the fact
that a republican form of govern
ment has been established in Brazil
and expresses confidence that our re
lations with the new republic will
continue most cordial and that our
commerce with that country will in
crease. He alludes to Central America
troubles and the killing of Gen. Bar
rundia, in connection with which the
president felt called upon to disavow
the action of the United States Min
ister Mizoer, who exeeded his au
thority, and recall hiaj from his post.
The Nicaraguan canal project is
making satisfactory progress ; also
negotiations for the payment of
claims of citizens of the United States
against the government of Chili.
Tbe message touches biiefly upon
our relation with China and France,
j which remain practically the same a9
; a year ago, and says that good re-
suits from the Samoan treaty made
last year promise to be soon appar
I ent.
I The beneficial working of the new
extradition treaty with Great Britian
is already evident.
The difference touching the Behi ing
i sea fur seal question is not adjusted.
Her majesty's offer of submission to
I arbitration has not beeu accepted, be-
cause the form of submission pro
posed, it is not thought, would as
sure a conclusion satisfactory to
either party. It is hoped before
another sealing season the United
States will be assured a property
right derived from Russia, and not
disregarded by any nation for 80
years preceding the outbreak of the
existing trouble.
Iu the tariff act duties are levied
on articles included in a reciprocity
treaty with Havana without indicat
ing an exception in that kingdom's
case. I presume this to be interna
tional, and hope congress will repair
what otherwise might seem a breach
of faith on our part.
The president refers to the claims
of United States citizens against
Hayti; the proposed amendment of
the extradition treaty with Italy and
the invitation of Italy to take part
in a conference to consider the adop
tion of a prime meridian from which
to reckon longitude, and approves
his predecessor's suggestion that
standing provision be made for ac
cepting invitations of foreign govern
ments to share in international con
ferences. He refers to the incident of the
seizure of the Allegudo bay railway
by Portugal, the claims of American
and British citixens, and the submis
sion of the question to three jurists
designated by the president of the
Swiss republic.
Grave and delicate questions exist
in our relations with Japan, but it is
believed that they can and will be
adjusted in a friendly manner.
Our friendship with Mexico was
never more conspicuous than now
nor more hopeful of increased bene
fits to both nations.
The extent and development of
our trade with the island of Cuba in
vest the commercial relations of the
United States with Spain with a
peculiar importance and the presi
dent bplieves that a special arrange
ment in regard to commerce, based
upon the reciprocity provision of the
recent tariff act, would operate most
beneficially for both countries.
The president briefly touches upon
the financial exhibit made by our
government, showing that the re
ceipts from all sources for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1890, were
8403,903,080, and the expenditures
6328,018,584. The surplus for the
year including the amount applied to
the sinking fund, was 105,344,490
The treasury statement for the fis
cal year, partly estimated, shows re
ceipts from all sources $400,000,000,
total expenditures from all sources
f3o4, 000,000, leaving a surplus of
852,000,000, not taking the postal
receipts into account.
The loss of customs revenue for
the last quarter is estimated at $25,
000,000, but from this is deducted a
gain of about 810,000,000 realized
during the first four months of the
year.
The president says : "The recent
depreciation in the price of silver
has been observed with regret. The
rapid rise in price which anticipated
and followed the passage of the act
'directing the purchase of silver bul
lion and the issue of treasury notes
therefor' was influenced in some de
gree by speculation, and the recent
reaction is in part the result of the
same cause and in part of the recent
monetary disturbance. Some months
of further trial will be necessary to
determine the permanent effect of
the recent legislation upon silver val
ues," but it is gratifying to know that
the increased circulation secured by
the act has exerted, and will continue
to exert, a most beneficial influence
upon business and upon general
values.
Referring to the report of the Sec
retary of the interior, the president
notes that the cost of collecting the
customs revenue was les9 last year
than ever before. Concerning the
experience of the members of the
customs administrative board provid
ed for by the act of June last, he
6poke of the evils they are to correct,
undervaluation, resulting in discrim
ination against honesty, urged the
value of their services, and sard high
duties should not be remedied by
quasi-smuggling.
The president calls attention to the
report of the secretary of war as
j showing a reductinn of 24 per cent in
! deserters from the army under the
j act of June 10 ; also beneficial effects
of the constitution of the hospital
! and service record bureaus. He con
; curs in the secretary's recommenda
; tions for the regular coast defense
I appropriations, and recommends the
I continuance and enlargement of the
j national guard.
i The president cilia attention to the
' prominent attention giving election
cases by the department of justice,
and to its prosecution of cases of per
secution of presidential postmasters.
; He recommends amendments of
j naturalization laws,
j An attempt will be made to pro
' hibit pool selling in the District of
Columbia.
The president commends the post
master general's report as showing a
reduction in deficit and improvement
in service. He also refers to the lot
tery law and its prompt enforcement
by the postal department.
The president says that the con
struction and equipment of the new
ship3 for onr navy have made very
satisfrctory progress. Since March
4, 1889, nine new vessels have been
put in commission and four more will
be added this winter.
It is a source of congratulation that
the anticipated influence of these
modern vessels upon the esprit du
corps of the officers and seamen has
been fnlly realized and confidence
and pride iu the ships among the crew
are equivalent to a secondary battery.
Favorable consideration of con
gress is invited to the recommenda
tions of the secretary.
Favorable action by congress upon
the various recommendations of the
secretary of the interior is urged.
Attention is called to the fact that
certain proposed agreements and ap
propriations made in connection' with
some of the Indian tribes have not
yet received the official sanction of
congress, and this should be prompt
ly attended to. If an agreement is
confirmed, all its terms should be
complied with without.delay, and full
appropriations should be made.
The disability pension act has been
put into operation as rapidly as pos
sible, and examination and adjudi
cation of claims have been made
more rapidly than ever under im
proved methods. There is no econo
my to the governments in delay,
while there is much hardship and in
justice to the soldier.
Referring to the Mormon question
the president says that while the re
cent letter of the president of the
Mormon church advising his people
"to refrain from contracting any
marriage forbidden by the laws of
the land" has had a most beneficial
influence, yet it must not be overlook
ed that ihe belief of the people that
polygamous marriages are right has
not changed. It is true that the law
should not attempt to deal with the
faith or belief of anyone, but it is
quite another thing, and the only safe
thing, so to deal with the territory of
Utah that those who believe poly
gamy to be rightful shall not have
the power to make it lawful.
The admission of new states is
happily alluded to the work of the
patent office commended, and atten
tion briefly called to the completion
of the census.
In reference to the agricultural de
partment the president calls atten
tion to the fact that, while the farm
ers have organized to increase their
profits, market prices of leading farm
products have advanced substantially
during the year and the export trade
in live animals and beef and pork
products has largely increased. This
trade will be further increased by in
spection and sanitary supervision.
The inspection abroad, secured by
the secretary's efforts, and that at
home provided for by the act of Aug.
30, 1890, will afford as perfect guar
antee for wholesomeness as is any
where given any food product.
The president approves the devel
opment of the best sugar industry,,
and notes the concurrence of the
secretary of the treasury of agricul
ture to transfer the official supervisor
of domestic sugar to the department
of agriculture.
The president spoke of the passage
of many important laws by the last
session of congress, and their quick
ening effect upon manufacturing in
dustries, larger and better markets
for breadstuffs and provisions, more
constant employment for working
people, and safe currency, but says
beneficial effects on commerce have
as yet but partially manifested them
selves.
The balance of trade, which for
two years had been against us, is now
in our favor. Bank clearings show
an increase of 8.4 per cent, indicat
ing a general increase in the volume
of business throughout the country
which the decrease of failures shows
to be on a safe basis. Labor is ev-.
erywhere fully employed and fewer
employes have been affected by
strikes and lockouts than since 1884.'
The depression in prices of agiicul
tural products have been relieved ;
the promising influences were check
ed by recent unfavorable monetary
events in England, but there was no
loss of credit in American securities,
and it is not believed these incidents
can long withstand the influences op
erating to give our people profitable
returns in trade. The apprehension
that our tariff may again at once be
subjected to important general chang
es would undoubtedly add a seriously
depressing influence.
Considerable space is devoted to
the consideration of the tariff. The
president says upon this subject
that the general tariff act has as yet
only partially gone into effect ; that
its success or failure can be as yet
only a matter of conjecture ; but that
it is curious to note that the advance
of articles wholly unaffected by the
tariff, but caused by influences en
tirely removed from the recent tariff
legislation, was by many ascribed to
that act.
There is neither wisdom nor jus
tice in the suggestion that the subject
of tariff revision shall be again open
ed before this law has had a fair tri
al. Xo tariff bill can perfectly satis
fy every interest, but the president
believes that the present law, in its
general scope and effect, will justify
the support of those who believe that
American legislation should conserve
and defend American trade and the
wages of American workmen.
Under this law the president looks
for an enlarged and more profitable
participation in foreign trade than we
have ever enjoyed and the recovery
of a proportionate participation in
the ocean carrying trade of the world.
There is no disposition among an'
of our people to promote prohibitory
or retaliatoay legislation, aud our
policies are adopted not to the hurt
of others, but to secure for ourselves
those advantages that fairly grow
out of our favored position as a na
tion. "From the time of my
introduction into office, the duty of
using every power and influence giv
en by law to the executive depart
ment for the development of larger
markets for our products, has been
kept constantly in mind, and no ef
fort has been or will be spared to
promote that eud."
"We are under no disadvantage in
any foreign market, except that we
pay our workmen and workwomen
better wages than are paid elsewhere
better absolutely, better relatively,
to the cost of tbe necessities of life."
Tbe passage of the tariff bill in its
present shape, the president says, ex
presses in advance the consent of
congress to reciprocity arrangements
affecting our products which must
otherwise have been delayed and un
ascertained until each treaty was rati
fied by legislation enacted by con
gress. The indications thus far given are
very hopeful of early and favorable
action by the countries from which
we receive our large imports of cof
fee and sugar, and it is confidently
believed that if steam communication
with these countries can be promptly
improved and enlarged the next year
will show a most gratifying increase
of our exports of breadstuffs and pro
visions, as well as of important lines
of manufactured goods.
Prompt action by congress upon
important bills left over by the last
session is strongly urged, and in view
of the large amount of work to be
done in this direction, the president
refrains from presenting other sug
gestions that would otherwise be
made. He reviews the suggestions
made in his last message relative to
the development of our steamship
lines, and says there is now, both in
this country and in the nations of
of Central and South America, a state
of expectation and confidence as to
increased trade that will give a double
value to prompt action upon this
question by congress.
The present situation of mail com
munication with Australia is recom
mended to congress as needing early
action. The colonies of New South
Wales and New Zealand are paying
the Oceanic steamship company more
than the United States for mail ser
vice and refuse to renew the contract,
now expiring, unless we pay a more
equitable proportion. The export
trade to these islands is very profita
ble, and, unless we wish to see that
this line withdrawn, congress should
empower the postmaster general to
make a liberal increase in our pay
ment for the transportation of these
mails.
The president here refers to the fa
vored position of the South Atlantic
and gulf ports toward the new com
merce promoted by the reciprocity
clause of the tariff act and the postal
shipping bill, justifies the large ap
propriation for Galveston harbor by
this consideration, and says the north
west will feel the advantage of south
ern trunk lines.
He renews the recommendation
that an international American bank
be granted a charter, and urge prompt
action.
The passage of the bill for the re
lief of the supreme court is recom
mended, and a readjustment of the
salaries of the district court judges.
The immediate adjustment of the
Spanish and Mexican land grants is
urged, and the suggestions of the secre
tary of the interior as to the amend
ments of pending bills are commend
ed. The enactment of a national bank
rupt law is recommended ; also an
international copyright law, legisla
tion to secure safety couplers and
brakes upon frieght trains used in in
terstate commerce, and some provis
ion looking to the conservation and
distribution of the water supply of
the arid region. The United States
should not construct dams or canals,
but by surveys determine the supply,
areas capable of irrigation, and loca
tion and capacity of reservoirs. The
use of water and reservoirs might be
ranted to states or individuals on
conditions securing the common
and equal use at a fair rate of the
accumulated water.
The government should not own or
operate the railroads or the telegraph
but could contract with the telegraph
companies to carry messages at speci
fied rates, and legislation "is recom
mended enabling the postoffice to test
by experiment the advantages of
such a use of the telegraph.
"Free and honest elections" are
the first essential condition of nation
al life. The need of the develop
ment of the existing law providing a
federal supervision of congressional
elections, as suggested in the last
annual message, has manifest' d it
self in man parts of the country,
The constitutionalitv of such legisla
tion h:i3 been affirmed ; its probable
effectiveness is evidenced by the op
position t'j it. It has been denounced
as of a new exercise of federal power
and invasion of state rights. Noth
ing could be further from the truth.
Congress has already provided for
supervisors of congressional elections.
The same law provides for the ap
pointment of deputy United States
marshals to support the supervisors
and arrest violators of election laws.
The present election law, in the
opinion of the president, stops just
short of effectiveness, for it surrend
ers to the local authorities all con
trol over the certification which es
tablishes the prima facie right to a
seat iu the house of representatives.
This defect should be cured. Equali
ty of representation and purity of the
elections must be maintained, or
everything that is valuable in our sys
tem of government is lost.
Such a law should be absolutely
non-partisan and impartial.
In conclusion, he says:
"I venture to again remind you
that the brief time remaining for the
consideration of the important legis
lation awaiting your consideration off
ers no margin for waste. If the
present duty is discharged with dili
gence, fidelity and courage, the work
of the 51 st congress may be confi
dently submitted to the considerate
judgment of the people.

It is now an absolute certainty that
no backward steps will be taken by
the republicans during this session of
congress. The cry is "forward, for
ward, "and the marching will be done
to the same old party music that has
led the party to its greatest triumphs
in the past, which will be repeated in
the future, just as certain as intelli
gence always in the course of time
gets the best of ignorance. The re
publicans are still in control of both
branches of congress, and republican
ideas will dominate all the legislation
passed between this and the 4th day
of next March, and in spit of dem
ocratic threats, howls and piteous ap
peals the original republican program,
mapped out long before the elections,
is to be carried out to the letter.
Mrs. Harrison has gone on the
long deferred visit to her old Indian
apolis home. She would have gone
several weeks ago, but the president
wished her to stay and take part in
the reception tendered to the Brazilian
naval officers who came here to pre
sent this government with a gold med
al for its timely action in recognizing
the young Brazilian republic. The
reception took place at the White
House Friday night, and was a very
