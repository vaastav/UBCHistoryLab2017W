of a I.IO.OOO. advertising campaign

To Inaugurate thto campaign was

to Now York, and ireont letters re

tractu lntvo been placed to properly
put the Hawaiian pines beforo tho

It liRb been thj opinion of tho
growers that the dluirultlcs nt over
production could b ovcrcomo by a
strong advertising campaign and that
properly promoted Iho pineapple will
becomo as much a household neces
sity as the fruits of California, for
Instance.
During his trip to tho Stntcs Mr.
Dole also visited Washington, and

Tho report of this hearing shows

pineapple growers of Florida.
The atmosphere o' Congress nt tho

antagonistic toward protected inter

Mc. McClcllan suggested a change
In tho law which now places our
growers at a disadvantage. He sug
gested that as the old law placed
a duty of sevon-tcnths of a cent per
plno on pineapples brought to tho
country In hulk, an I as the shippers
aro able by shipping tho pines In
crates to get them In at about half
this rato, under scvidulo of seven
cents n square foot, that tho law be
changed so that all imported pineap
ples will pay tho straight seven
tenths of a cent each or possibly one
cent when entering the country.
whether In bulk or In crates.
The real contest for pineapples
and every other prnJuct on tho pro

Babbitt To Gall Meeting
Of Board Next
Monday
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion W. If. Ilabbltt ulll probably call
a meeting of tho Board of Education
on Monday next for the purpose ot
discussing proposcl legislation with
regards to that dooirtment nt tho
next session of tho Legislature. All
of the departments are working up
the lists of appropriations which' tbey
will 'ask from the Legislature. These
lists will be sent to Actlnr Clovernor
Mott-Smlth, who made Vreqilesl 'on
the various headi'Of department
some tlmo ago for them.
The principal matter that will pro
bably occupy the attention of tho
Hoard of Education it Its meeting on
legislation will bo that of teacher's
salaries. As has been told In tho
II u 1 1 o 1 1 n before, the pay doled
out to tho public educators of the
Territory of Hawaii Is far less than
It should be. It hah simply been a
matter of cutting down In salaries In
order to keep within the appropria
tions, or cuUIti" down the staff of
tcachors, tho Hater alternative being,
as n matter of fact, practically Im
possible, As soon js Mr. Ilabbltt has figured
out the exact amount of money need
ed to raise the salaries of teachers to
thn proper schedule he will present
tho proposition to the Hoard. This
will probably bo dono next Monday.
Ilabbltt and heads of the other Ter
ritorial department? aro working on
the complete appropriation list to bo
presented to Mott-Sinlth.

Ono of tho most Important now

bicycle officers will be appointed, in

who are stationed nt the station to

given bents In tbo outskirts, such us

They will not wear uniforms, and It
will bo their duty, besides preserv
