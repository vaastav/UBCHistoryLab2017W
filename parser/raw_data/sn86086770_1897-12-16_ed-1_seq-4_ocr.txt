The President’s Message.
President McKinley’s message to
congress furnishes food for discus
sion on four public questions, to-wlt:
the annexation of Hawaii, our atti
tude toward the Cuban issurection,
reform of our currency system, and
the government civil service.
On all these there are differing
opinions in the president’s party,and
harmonious action is not probable
on either. He positively favors the
annexation of Hawaii, to which sev
eral republican senators and news
papers are opposed,among the la,ter
being the Milwaukee Sentinel.
From the arguments that have
come under its notice, the I'mihiink
can but doubt the wisdom of annex
ation. There appears in it no ad
vantage commensurate with the ob
jections against taking into the body
politic the iindeserviible elements
that comprise the great majority of
the population of the islands.
While a formidable jingo element
of our country vociferously clamor
for immediate interference In the af
fairs of Cuba, the President advises
moderation, and avoidance of action
tdiat may ended! us in a war with
Spain, for which no justification is
yet apparent. In this the President
has the support of tho unprejudiced
sentiment of the country, and con- 1
gr< -- is likely to coincide.
One feature of the President's ree
commendutioii on the currency
quest ion is a surprise. It is I hat Nu
tional banks be allowed to issue pa
per mom V to the extent of one-lmlf
of their capital stock, secured only
by lie assets of the bank, ill addi
tion to an issue equal to the par
value of government bonds depos
ited by -m b haul,-. The proposi
tion is sure to nn i I strenuous oppo
sition among republicans, and its eu
ncliie nl into a law seems highly im
probable.
The President ie. minuends modi
fication and elucidation of the civil
service laws, which be, with most
other people who b.i\ noticed their
work, duds to In very unsatisfactory,
li our chief execntivi bad gum fur
rier i II t b is I j lie a ml asked I'm the re
peal nf the -i' i alb and ••ivil-serv Ice-re
form laws, mi the ground that in
their operation I lux are unjust, mi-
Aim riciiii and dishonest, lie would

As to the Election ol U. S. Senators.
A -ugge-ijon by the Stall Journal
siiiie- time ago tbal candidates for I .
S. s. Motor should be nominated by
Male con viint nms has elicited con
siderable comment. The Milwaukee
Sentinel jumped into the proposition,
vigorously opposing it, and the Jour
nal refused to defend it, claiming
only to have suggested it to bring
out sentiment. Tin Sentinel's oppo
sition to the proposjtinn is based on
the theory that a convention is held
less strictly to accountability than a
legislature, which nl course Is true.
But the un i it of nomination by a
convention is (bat it mn-t stand tin
lest of rile polls. It I- not It 11 111. II

reaping the benefit of the protective
system, which has made the manu
facture of cotton goods so successful
as to not only supply the markets of
tiie United States, but to now be able
to supply the markets of the world.
The Increase In the plug tobacco
trade is cited by the Cour
ier-Journal as one of the evidences
of returning prosperity. The point
is well taken. Plug tobacco is used
by the laboring element principally,
and there was a sharp drop in its
consumption soon after the panic of
18113 began. A large growth in the out
put of plug tobacco lias taken place
recently, although leaf tobacco is
nearly 2nn per cent, higher in price
than it was u year ago, and the plug
variety lias also,of course, advanced.
Manifestly hundreds of thousands
more wag'- earners are employed now
than were at work in 18%.—St. Louis
G lobe-1 lemocrat.
The democratic liars continue
their denunciations of the Dfngley
law, based upon absolute falsehoods.
A sample of Ibis is found in a re
cent, publication of the New York
Journal, which, on the morning fol
lowing the presentation of President
McKinley’s message, said that Pres
ident McKinley “finds the Dingley
bill producing smaller revenues and
greater deficits than the measure bis
platform denounced ever did.” The
absolute falsehood of this statement
is shown from the official figures of
the treasury d< parment, which set
forth that the receipts under the
Dingley law- in its first four months
are more than s7,nnn,(XH) in excess of
those of the Wilson law in tilt; first
four months of its history, being in
the four months in which it Inis been
in operation $!K),517,114 against $83,-
038 0(17 produced by tile Wilson law
in the corresponding period of its
history.

ThE BREADFRUIT TREE.
flonartlilng About This Ktranfe and Useful
Asiatic Plant.
The breadfruit tree is a native nf
southern Asia, the south Pacific islands
ami the Indian archijiclago. In appear
ance it resembles somewhat the wild
chestnut. It grows to the height of 4o
or 50 feet and has dark green leaves,
many of them two feet in length, which
are deeply divided into pointed loin's.
Hidden among the great leaves the
breadfruit grows. It is a sorosis, is
nearly spherical, often weighs four or
, more pounds and has a thick, yellow
rind. This fruit is the chief food of the
south sea islanders. They seldom eat a
meal without it. The eatable part lies
between the rind and the core and
, when fully ripe is yellow and juicy, it
is better for food before it has matured,
, and the batives gather it while tin
pulp is white.
Before it is ready for table use it must
bo roasted, when it looks like wheat
bread, and is both palatable and nutri
tious. Usually the fruit is cut into thr<
or four slices and roasted or linked in
an oven.
Frequently the people of a village
! join in making a huge oven, in which
several hundred breadfruits may be
baked at one time. Thus they are all
supplied with bread without its cost
ing any of them much labor. Prepared
in this way, the bread will keep for
weeks.
The breadfruit is in season eight
months of the year. When the season
finally draws to a close, the last fruit*
are gathered and made into a sour paste
called “mahei.” This paste will keep
good for months and is made into balls,
wrapped in leaves and baked, just us
needed.
Bread is not the only product of the
breadfruit tree. From it cement, cloth,
tinder and lumber are also obtained. A
glutinous, milky juice oozes from the
trunk of the tree, which makes an ex
cellent cement when boiled with cocoa
nut oil. From the fibrous inner bark a
kind of coarse cloth is made, and the
big leaves make good towels. The lum
ber is used for building houses and
many other purposes. Besides all this
the dried blossoms are used us tinder
I when fires are kindled.—Philadelphia

THE CLUTCH
OF THE LAW.
: ; : Domestic happiness can
easily be kept out of the clutches of the
law if all wives will take a hint from a
man. A man is a person which is ruled
by bis stomach, and bis stomach is rul
ed by the food put into it, so really the
food a man eats decides whether he
shall be cross or good humored-whet her
be shall do good work or bad work, it
