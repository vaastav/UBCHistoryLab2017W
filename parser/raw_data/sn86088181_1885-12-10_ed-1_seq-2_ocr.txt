be classed as a strongly written em

takes the pains to collect the figures
showing the progress of Texas, and
incidentally mentions the fact that
the state has a permanent school fund
aggregating in yolue $71,000,000,
that the rate of taxation, is but one
fourth of one per cent. He closes
with the following : "We have good

This will in a manner atone for the
Governor's Horace Baker letter, and
let Lim down from tho absurd poni

but that the newspaper criticisms
on that letter induced him to wrilo
to' tho North American Boview so as
to counteract its damaging effects.
We should think the thick-and-thin

nor, wuq Hastened to endorse the
Baker letter and 'overflowed with
twaddle about "pauper emigratiou

The opponents of Prohibition in
Atlanta it is said propose to contest
the late election. Meautime they are
proclaiming that if enforced, prohibi
tion would ruin the business of the
city. On this point the following
from the Ansrusta, Ga. NewB, would
seem to be conclusive :
Prohibition will do no harm. It
will not chock Atlanta's prosperity,
It will promote it. Tho testimony
from all the counties that have adopt
ed prohibition is that they are more
peaceful and more prosperous tnan
they were when' they legalized the
sale, of intoxicating liquors. The op
ponents of prohibition in that city will
be wise if they will accept their de
feat with a proper spirit, and consent
to let prohibition Lave a fair and
square trial.

We are credibly informed that a

that he would give him (the grocery

took bis cue from the course of
some oar county officials towards the

our informant remarked, boycotting
may do in Ireland, but will hardly
prove profitable to those attempting
it in Texas.

Jn orJer to procure dusks etc., it
was found necessary this year to re

ordof to extend tho term nino months,

Tho incidental foe of $1, is indmpon

Payment of tho incidental fee wil
givo them a term of fivo months, and
navment of both incidental aud
monthly dues as above, will give them
nine months schooling.
It is earnestly hoped that none wi

nine months, by the payment of the
small amounts necessary to that end
With regard to the boycotting of
the Houston Age by the Knights of
Labor, one of the oddest things is,
that the great Anheuser Beer com
pany was the first to succumb to the
demand of the Eights by withdraw
ing their large advertisement. This
to Uncle Daniel must have been the
unkindest cut of all. This submis
sipn of the liquor dealers is the more
remarkable in view of the fact that
the Knights refuse membership to
any of that fraternity or their victims.
One would have naturally supposed,
therefore, the liquor influence would
set their edicts, at defiance.
We will add, that while we approve
of much in the platform of the Knights,
we think; their boycutting methods of
very questionable justice or propriety

WASHIXUTOX LETTER.
From Oar Realar CorntpoDdtHt.
Wabhinoto.v, Nov. 30, 1885.
Owing to the death of Vice-Presi
dent Hondricks, the question of the
Presidential succession has interested
everybody to the neglect of all specn
lation concerning the organization of
the Huse of Representatives, the
revision of the rules, the fate of Mr.
Randall, the President's message, and
other matters that have been the
taplcsof discussion for several weeks.
The Sonitors in the city are con
tinually questioned to learn what they
think ehould L done to fill the place
of President of the Senate. The im
pression strengthens that the Repub
lican majority will offer it to Senator
Logan. Q.vite a number of politi
cians in Washington are fcusily engag
ed in nrging cis election And yet
he is the only maq in the Senate of
whom it can be aid that be wis a
candidate before the people, for the
! Vie-Presidency and was rejected.

car.tb p of one? cotura:tt ae.i pov j
ministration, which eat off torus of
the perquisites that belong to the
older Senntbia. "Malt Lim Presi
dent pro teiH of th Senate," ' they
say, "and thus give him a nice private
room and a little patronage aa a re
compense for what ha lost last March."
TbauLoganite" assert that Sen
ator Edmund) does not want the
honor again, and they talk of Lis dic
tatorial manner in the Forty-Eighth
Congress, when ho was accused of
loctnring Lis fellow Senators as if
they were school boys. Every little
episode iu which kharp words wore
uttered in the Senate last winter is
used against Mr. Edmunds by the
ftionds of Logan.
Democratic Senators freely express
their preference for Sonator Ed
munds. They think it would be very
unwiso to put so strong a partisan as
Gen. Logan so near (he President
It might arouse too great expecta
tions among Gen. Logan's followers,
who are of the most radical class.
Great pressor was brought to bear
npon tho President for the purpose
of dissuading Lim from attending the
funeral of Mr. Hendricks at Jndiana-
Eolis, A number of Senators, Mem
ors of the House, prominent Demo
crat and personal friends visited him
for the purpose of urging npoq him
the importance of remaining m Wash
ington. A large number of telegrams
to the same effect were received
Their argument was that the public
mind is somewhat excited, and that
the press is commenting upon the
fact that the death of President Cleve
land would restore the Republican
party to power. This they feared
might tempt another GuUeay to take
the President's life. Mr. Cleveland's
visitors said they did not like to dis
cuss the question of hi death, but
they thought it their duty to advise
him to guard bia life carefully, a it
was now of more importance than
ever.
At first the president said he did
not feel called noon to consider the
question of personal risk in the dis
charge ol wnat ne considered nis
duty. After repeated protests against
the trip, however, he intimated a
willingness to be guided by the judg
ment of men who were influenced
only by a desire to do everything to
insure order.
There is muob talk of legislation to
provide foi the Presidential succes
sion. The JUemocrats ieei rancu an
noyed at the idea of the Republicans
having it m their power to eieci a
possible successor to President Cleve
land. If the latter should die, the
law now coverninir the succession
would at once be questioned. It is
believed by some of the best lawyers
in Congress that no Senator or Mem
ber is eligable for succession to the
Presidency. Early in the new Con
gress steps will be taken to pass a
bill keeping the suoccssion witu tue
Cabinet ouicers.
Loiter from Mrs. Day Florida and
Texas Compared,
Fost Whit. Fla., Nov. 23 1885.
Editob Fbei Pbebs : On mr return to
MikfiBville, after an absence, of Berernl weeks,
I find quite a let of mail matter awaiting
me, and amonp.st all several of the Fbkb
Pbbhs, for which I am indeed thankful It
is always a treat to get a home pipit,
Florida, or the portion that I hate visited,
has been extremely healthy, this having
been a very remarkable season, aud I think
for a winter resort or a home for five or six
months in the year, the climate of Florida
cannot be surpassed, but for a permanent
home I should prefer Texas, the air seems
so much pnrer and dryer in the Summer.
The winters here aro perfectly delightful
to thor.e from colder climates, but after
remaining here through the long hot sum
mer, one becomes naturally debilitated, and
tbe climate is not steady and bracing
enongh for one in that oondition, and then
there is so muoh dampness iu the atmos
phere here, that' it is neoessary to use mora
precautious than most persons do visiting
here. They eome with heavy overooats and
wraps suited to their own climate, and of
course have to lay them aside, not thinking
that it is necessary to nso any oare against
the heavy dews and damp air. If one could
spend their summers, in tome other cjimate
and their winters in Florida, it would be
indeed delightful.
This is indeed is an enjoyable aeason
here, oranges and other fruit just in season,
and the beautiful sugar can field being
out down and made into the most delightful
sugar and syrup. If I had any descriptive
power I won Id like to write an artiole for
the Fbii Press on Florida, but will have to
beg to be excused, but should you find any
thing in tbe little I have written, worth
mention, of course you are at liberty
to do so.
I am sorry intleod to hear of ao much
sickness in San Marooa. Dengue seem to
bve visited all portions of Texas, There
ba been nothing of the kind her. My visit
to Florida has been prolonged on account
of my brother who ha been lingering
for months with cancer, ba is still living
and I shall remain her until spring opens.
Amjgrowing anxious to return to Texaa. But
for the uncertainty of remaining her ao
long, I ehould have auhaeribed to tbe Faxx
Pax, aud aa I am permanently located for
the winter, wui ask yon to aeod it u ma
regularly.
We have only had two light frost. Hop
ing that you may all have a mild winter,
and wishing I could eend my 8aa Marooa
friend some of the delightful fruit w are
enjoying here, I will oloe. Tour truly.
