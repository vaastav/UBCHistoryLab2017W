Crude Petroleum as a Remedy In Con
sumption. Dr. M.M. Grifiith, of Bradford, Ta.,
reports some of the most astonishing
results obtained by tho administration
of crude petroleum to consumptives.
IIo claim that out of twenty-live cases
of well-marked tuberculosis so treated
twenty are to all means of diagnosis
cured ; tho rest havo been materially
benefited ; and none havo been under
treatment more thau four months. Tho
nausea attending tho uso of ordinary
crude petroleum led him to adopt tho
semi-solid oil that forms on tho casing
and tubing of wells.? This, made into
three to five-grain pills by incorporat
ing any inert vegetable powder, was
administered from three to live times a
day in one-pill doses. The first effect,
ho say3, is tho disappearance of tho
cough ; night sweats are relieved, appe
tite improves, and weieht is rapidly
gained. It is to bo hoped that Dr.
Griffith Las not mistaken some self-
limiting phase of throat or bronchial
disorder for true consumption of tho
lungs; also that continued trial of tho
:uiegcu remcciy win jusuiy tno liigli
opinion he has formed in regard to its

Let Us Travel.
No sooner does the now-famous Ger
man physician discover that lemons are
an unquestioned assurance of longev
ity than another man comes forward
with his prescription. This gentleman
is Mr. Charles Francis Adams, Jr., who
lias made p, life-long studj' of railroads.
As tho result of his inspection of tho
Massachusetts statistics he declares 4 if
any given person wero born upon a
railroad car and remained upou it, trav
eling 500 miles a day all his life, ho
would, with average good fortune, bo
somewhat over 80 years of age before
ho would be involved in cny accident

respectable age of 030 years beforo b-

I Save the Hags,
f A penny saved is a penny got," is a maxim
as truo as it is old. And there is many a neg
lected opportunity in almost every household
by which pennies that are otherwise allowed to
go to waste might bo saved to the fam
ily. Take the one item of racs. How few
housowives think of saving the little scraps of
calico, of linen, and the old, worn-out clothes,
and selling them to tho paner-manu-
facturers? Thousands unon thousands of
dollars are thus wasted every year that
ought to go into the family coffers. If house
wives and their children and helpmates would
carefully save all the rags through tho year,
and lay aside the receipts from the sales, they
would be astonishod, when the holidays came
around, at tho size of the fund accumulated
from this source. The recont rapid advance in
tho price of rags renders It doublv imnortant
that the matter should be attended to.
If the "gade wife" don't feel like bothering her
head and hands with the matter, then let her
encourage . the children in the work. It will
pay to save the rags. Don't neglect it
The Advance in Paper.
The paper-makers seem to havo becomt
crazy upon tho subject of prices of paper, and
are rushing things in a manner most renurka

THE MESSAGE,
! Annual Communication oi
! President Hayes,
Read to Congross on Monday, Doc. 1.
Feu.ow-Citizens of the s'enate and House
ok Representatives : The member of th
Forty-sixth Congress hare assembled in their
iiist n guhr session under circumstance call
ing for mutual congratulations aud graUful
acknowledgement to tLo Giver of all good lor
the largo and unusual measure of national
prosperity which wo now enjoy. TLo most iu
toreeting events which havo occurred iu our
t public affairs since my last annual messsgo to
Congress aro connectol with tho financial
operations of the Government directly affecting
the business interests of tho country.
IU'Htllliptloi).
I congratulate Congress on the successful
execution of the Resumption act A'
the timo fixed, and iu the manner
contemplated by law. United States note
i began to be redeemed in coin. Since
tho 1st of January last they have
boon prompt y redeemed on presentation, and
in all business transactions, public and private,
in all parts of the country, they are rocoived
and paid out as the equivalent of coin. Tho
demand upon tho treasury for gold and silver
in exchaugo for United states notes has been
comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit
of coin and bullion in exchange for notes has
been very largo. Tho exeecs of tho precious
metals deposited or exchanged for United, States
notes over the amount of United States notes
redeemed is about f iO.OOO.OtO.
Tho resumption of specie payments has boon
followed by a very great rovival of business.
With a currency equivalent in value to tho
money of the commercial world, we aro ena
bled to enter upon an equal competition with
otter nations in trade and production. Tho
increasing foreign demand for our manufact
ures and agricultural products has caused a
large balauce of trade in our favor, which has
been paid in gold, from tho 1st of July last to
Nov. 15, to tho amount of about S5i,00U,t'l0.
Public Credit.
Since tho resumption of specie payments
there has been a marked and gratifying im
provement of tho public credit. The bonds of
the Government bear. Mg only 4 per cent, inter
est havo sold at or above par, Hufhvieur. in
amount to pay off all of tho national debt
which was redeemable under tho preret
Uws. The amount of interest saved auniudy
by the process of refunding the debt since
March 1, 1877. is f 14,2.)7,177. The bonds sold
were largeiy in small sums, and the number of
our citizens now holding the public securities
is much greater than ever before. The
amount of tho national debt, which maturos
iu less than two years, is $7J2, 121,7U, of
which $:00,eoo,000 bear iuterent at tho
rate of 5 per cent. It is believed that
this part of tho public debt can Le re
funded by the issue of 4-rer-cont. bond,
and by tho reduction of interest which will
thus be effacted aWit $ll,OUO,OX.O can bo an
nually saved to tho treasury. To teenre this
importaut reduction of interest to bo paid by
the United States, further legislation is re
quired, which it is hoped will bo provided by
Congress during its present session. The
coinage of gold by the mints of tho United
States during the last fiscal year was $40
D12.
Silver Coinage.
The coinage of silver dollars since the pass
age of the act for that purpose up to Nov. 1,
l7'Jt was $43,(,IH),8.jO, of which $12,700,3-1!
havo been istued from the treasury, and ro
now in circulation, and $:J2,:iOO,r0() are still in
tho possession of the Government The pen
dency of the proportion for unity of action be
tween tho United SUtca and the principal com
mercial nations of Europe to effect a perma
nent system for tho equality of gold aud
silver in the recognized money of the
world, leads mo to recommend that Congress
refrain from new legislation on the general
subject The great revival of trad?, in
ternal and foreign, will supply luring
tho coming y-ear its own instructions, which
may well be awaited beforo attempting furthor
experimental measures ith the coinage. I
would, however, sirongly urge upon Congress
the importance cf authorizing tho Secretary of
tho Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver
dollars upou the present legal ratio. Themarket
valuo of tho tilver dollar being uniformly and
largely less than tho market value of tho gold
dollar, it i3 obviously impracticablo to main
tain them at par with each other if both are
coined without limit. If tho cheaper coin is
forced into circulation it will, if coined without
limit, bocomo tho sole standard of value, and
thus defeat tho desired object, which is a cur
rency of both gold and silver, whicn shall be of
equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the
universally-recognized money of the world.
lgal Tender.
The retirement from circulation of United
States notes, with trio capacity of leual tender
in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our
progress to a fair and stable currency, which
should bo accepted as tho policy and duty of
the Government and the interest and security of
tne people. It is my firm conviction that tho I
issue of the legal-tender paper monev, based
wnoiiy upon the authouty and credit of the '
litv
uovernmeut, except in extreme cmerg
ucj, ia wuuoui warrant in the con
stitution, and a violation of sound finan
cial principles. Tho issue of United States
notes during the late civil war, Mith tho
capacity of legal tender between private indi
viduals, was not authorized except as a means
of rescuing tho country from imminent peril.
The circulation of these notes as paper money
for any protracted period of timo after the ac
complishment of this purpose was not contem
plated by the fnmers of the laws under which
they were issued. They anticipated tho re
demption and withdrawal of these notes at the
earliest practicable period consistent with tho
attainment of tho object for which they wero
provided.
Sinking Fund.
The policy of tho United States steadily ad
hered to from tho adoption of the constitution
lias been to avcid the creation of a national
debt, and when, from necessity, in the timo of
war, dil's havo been created, they have been
bee i paid off on tho return of peaso as rapidly
as poosihlo. With this viw. and for this pur
pose it is recommended that the existing lawj
for the accumuUtion of a sinking fund suffi
cient to extinguish the public debt within a
limited period bo maintained. If any change
of tho objects or rates of taxation is deemed
noce.Hary by Congress, it is sugge-ited that ex--perienco
has shown that a duty can bo placed
on tea an;l coffee which will not enhance the
prico of those articles t tne consumer, and
whie'i will add sevoral millions of dollars an
nually to the treasury.
The Suppression of Polygamy.
Tho continued dr;liierato violation by a
large number of the prominent and inlluential
ci'izeriH of the Territory of Utah of tho laws of
t4ie United States for trio prosecution aud pun
ishment of polygamy dennnds the attention of
every department of tho Government. This
Territory has a population sufficient to en
title it to admission as a Stato. Tho general
interests of tho nation, as well as tho welfare
of tho' citizens of the Territory, require
its advanco from tho Territorial form
of Government to tho responsibilities
and and privileges of a State. This im-
f)')rtatt c'mnzo will not, however, bo approved
y the country while the citizens of Utah, in
verv considerable number, upheld a practice
which is condemned as a crime by the laws of
all civilized communities throughout tho world.
ine law ror tho ftuppici-xUin of thi offense was
enacted with great unvdmity by Congress moro
than seventeen years ag. but has remained
until recently a dead letter in tho Territory of
Utah lecauso of tho peculiar difficulties attend
ing its enforcement. The opinion widely pre
vailed among tho ci'izens of Utah that tho law
was in contravention of tho constitutional guar
anty of religious freedom.
This objection H now removed. Tho Su
premo Court of tho United States has decided
the law to bo within tho legislative power
of CoDgress, and binding, as a rule of
action, for all who resided within the
Territories. There is no longer any reason for
delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It
should be firmly and effectively executed If
not snQiclentJy stringent in its provisions, it
should be aaicndoj, and, in aid of the
purpo-e i'i view, I recommend that more com
prcLeutivo and moro snatching methods for
preventing ss well a punisl ing this crimo be
u.n tided. If necessary to secure o to Jieuce to
the law, the enjoyment ami exercise of the
rights and privileges of citizenship in the
Territories of the United Statej may 'be with
held or withdrawn from those who violate or
oppose tho enforcement of the law on this
subject
Popular Kltfhts.
The elections of the past year, though
occupied only with State ofllces, have
not failed to elicit, iu the political oUcnsaiona
which attended them ail over tho country, pew
and decisive evidence of tho deep interest
which tho great body of citizens take
iu tho progress of the cauntry toward
a more general aud complete establib
ment, at whatever cost, of universal
security and freedom In the exerciso of the
elfctivo franchise. While many topics cf
political concern demand great attention from
our people, both iu the ephere of National and
State authori'y, I find no reason to qualify the
opinion I "xpressed in my Jat annual message,
that no temporary or administrative interest!
of Government, however urgent or weighty,
will ever destroy the zeal of our people in de
fense of the primary rights of citizenship, and
that the power of publio opinion will over
ride all political prejudices and ail sectioual
aud State attachments in demanding tha; all
over our wide territory tho namo and character
of citizens of the United States shall mean one
and the tame tl ing.and cairy with them unchal
lenged security and respect. I earnestly appral
to the intelligence and patriotism of all good
citizens of every part of the country, however
much they may bu divided in opinious on other
political subjects, to unite in compelling
obedience to existing laws aimed at the
protection of the right of suffrage. I
respectfully urge upon Congress to supply
any defects in these laws which experience
has shown, and which it is within its power to
remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of
tho Executive and Legislative authorities of the
States in this great purpose. I am fully con
vinced that it the public mind can be set at
rest on this paramount question of popular
rights, no serious object will thwart or delay
the complete pacification of the country, or re
tard tho general diffusion of prosperity.
Civil-Service lCrrorm.
In a former message I invited the attention
of Congress to the subject of the reformation
of the civil service of tho Government, and
expressed the intention of transmitting to Con
gress, as oarly as practicable, a report upon
this subject by the Chairman of the Civil Serv
ice Commission. In view of the fact that
during a considerable period the Government
of Great Britain has been dealing with
administrative problems and abuses in
various particulars analagous to those present
ed in this country and that, in recent vtars,
tho measures adopted were understood to have
been effective and in every respect highlv sat
isfactory, 1 thought it desirable to havo fuller
information upon tho subject, and accordingly
requeeted tho Chairman of the Civil Service
Commission to make a thorough investigation
for this purpoao. Tho result has beer, an elab
orate and comprehensive report The report
sets forth tho history of tho partisan spoils sys
tem in Groat Britain, and of the riso and fall of
tho Parliamentary patronage, and of of
ficial interference with the , freedom of
elections. It shows that, after long
trials of various kinds of examina
tions, thoso which aro competitive and
open on equal terms to all, and which are car
ried on untlor the superintendence of a tingle
commission, have with great advantage been
established as conditions of admission to almost
every oflicial placo in tho subordinate adminis
tration of that country aud of British India.
The completion of the report, owing to the ex
tent of the labor involved in its preparation, and
the omission of Cougreesto make any provis
ion either for tho compensation or the expenses
of the commission, has been postponed until
Mie presjut time. It is herewith transmitted
t) Congress. While tho measures of another
Government are of no au'hority for us, thev
are entitled to iutluenco to the extent to which
their infr nsic wisdom and their adaptation to
our institutions and social life may corr mend
tlum to our consideration. Tho views I hve
heretofore expressed concerning tho defects
ana uinic iu our civil administration, remain
unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged ex
pei ieuce hs opened my senso of the duty both
of oflieers and of the people themselves
to co-operate for their removal. Tho grave
evi!n and t erils of s parlisan-spods system of ap
point rout to oftice and office tenure are n w
generally recognized. In tho resolutions of the
great parties, in tt.o reports of doj-a tmei.ts, in
tho debates and proceedings of Congress, i:i the
messages of Kxecut.ves. the cravitv of thci-e
ovils has been poiutcd out, and tho need of thHr
reform has been admitted. To command tho
necessary support, every measure of tcfoim
must bo based on common ritfht aud jii?'ie ,
and must bo compatible Mith the h'-ahbv
existence of great partie?, which are inevital h
and essential in a free state. When the
people havo approved a policy at a
national election, confidence on tho put of
tho ofheers they have nelected, and of the aa
visors who, in accordance with our politic 1
institutions, should be consulted in the po icy
which it is their duty to carry into cflVcf,
is indispensable. It in eminently proper th.t
they should explain it before tho people, as
well as illustrate its spirit iu ihe performunc?
of their official duties. It hardly need be
pointed ou; that very differeut coutddc-ratious
aPPv t0 the greater number of those ho
mi nbordinao places in the civil service
fill the a
-mcir responsibility is to their
snnerinrH
in official position. It ii thpir 1
obey the legal instructions of those upon whom
that authority is involved, and their bet-t pub
lic sorvico consists in the discharge of their
functions irrespective of partisan politics.
Their dudts are the same whatever party is in
power, and batevrr policy prevails. As a
consequence, it follows that their tenure of
offico abo'ild not depend upon the prevalence
of any policy or tho supremacy of any party,
but should bo determined by their capacity to
serve tho people most usefully, quite
irrespective of partisan interests. Ihe
same consideration that should govern
the tenure should also prevail ii tho ap
pointment, discipline, and removal of thaso
sulwrdinates. The authority of appointmont
and removal ii not a perquisite which may be
used to aid a friend or reward a parti an, but
is a trust to bo exercised in the public inteiost,
under all the sanctions which attend tho
obligation to apply tho publio funds only for
public purpooes. Every citizen has an equal
riKht to tho honor and profit of entering tho
publio sorvico of his country. The only just
ground of discrimination is tho measure of
character and capacity he has to make that
sorvice most useful to the people.
Except in cases where, upon Just and recog
nized principles, as upon the theory of pen
sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as
rewards of past services, their bestowal upon
any theory which disregards personal merit is
an act of injustice to tho citizen, as well as a
breach of that trust subject to which the ap
pointing power is hold. In the light of these
principles it bocomos of crfat i
provide just acd adequate incar s, especially for
every department and largo admintttative of
fice, whero personal discrimination on tho part
of its head is not practicable for accertaii ii g
thoso qualifications to which appoin'mei.ti
and removals should have reference.
To fail to provide sih means is not only to
deuy the opportunity of ascertaining ihe facts
upon which the inuet righteous claim to offio
dopeud, but of necessity to di -courage all
worthy aspirants by handing over appoint
ments and removals to mere influence and
favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest
claimant to gain the appointment, and tho in
terest of the peoplo to bestow it upon him,
it would rcera clear that a wise and
jusi method of ascertaining person
al fitness for offico must needs Ikj
an Important and permanent function of every
just and wise Government. It has long sincn
become impossible in tho great offices for these
having tho duty of nomination and appoint
ment to personally examine into tho individual
qualifications of moro than a small proportion
of thofe seeking office, and with tho enlarge
ment of civil servieo that proportion must con
tinue to become leas. In the earlier years of
the Government tho subordinate offices wero s
few in numler that it was easy for those mak
ing appointments and promotions to personally
ascertain the merits of tho candidates,
larty managers and methods had theu
Income powerful agents of coorcion hos
tile to the freo and just exercise of
the appointing power. A large and
responsible part of the fluty of restoring the
civil service to the desired purity and eflicioncy
rest upon the President; and it has been my
purpose to do what is within my power to ad
vance such prudent and gradual measures of
reform aa will most surely aud rapidly bring
about that radical change of system essential
to make our administrative methods satisfac
tory to a free and intelligent people by a proper
exercise of authority. It is in the power of
the Kxecutivo to do much to promote such a
reform, but it canuot be too clearly understood
that nothing adequate can be accomplished
without co-operatiou on the part of Congress
and considerate and intelligent support
among the people, lteforms which challenge
the generally-accepted theories of parties and
demand changes in the methods of departments
are not the work of a day. Their permanent
foundation must be laid in sound principles
and hi an experience which demonstrates their
wisdom and exposes the errors of their adver
saries. Every worthy officer deBires to make
his oflicial action an honor to his country. But
the people themselves, far more than their ofll
cers in public station, are interested in
a pure, economical, and vigorous admin
istration. By laws enacted in 1&.W and
18T)5. and now in substance incorporated in
the Revised Statutes, the practice ol arbitrary
appointments to the several subordinate grades
In tho great departments was condemned, and
examinations as to capacity, to be conducted
hy lho Departmental Boards of Eiaminers,
wore provided for and made conditions of ad
mission to the public service. These statutes
are a decision hy Congress that examinations
of some sort as to attainments and capaciiy are
essential to the well-being of tho public ser
vice. The important questions since tho en
actment of thoso laws have been aa Jo the char
acter of these examinations, and whether odi
cial favor and partisan iutlucnce or com
mon ngtit and invnt wero to control tho
access to tho examinations. In practice these
examinations havo no! always been open to
worthy persons generally who might wish to
be exsmined. Official favoritism aud partisan
influence, as a rule, appear to have designated
those who alone wero permitted to go beforo
the examining lo4rds, subjecting even the exam
iners to a pressure from rho fritnds of the can
didates very difficult to rceiat. As a conse
quence, the standard of admission foil below'
mat which the publio interest domanded.
It was almost inevitable that a system
wuicu proviuoa lor various separate
boards of examiners, with no com
mon supervision or uniform method of
procedure, should result in confusion, in
consistency, and inadequate tests of capacity
highly detrimental to the public interest.
A 'further and moro radical change was
obviously required. In the annual message
of December, 1S70, my predecessor declared
that "there is no duty which so much
embarrasses tho Executive and heads of
departments as that of appointments, nor is
there auy such arduous and thanklesu labor im
posed on Senators aud Representatives as that
of finding places for constituents. Tho pres
ent system does not secure the best
men, and often not even fit men, for
the public places. The elevation and mirifl-

results have beon salutary in a marked
degree, and that the general application of
similar rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit
to the service. Tho reports of the Government
officers in the city of New York especially
bear decided testimony to tho utility of
open competitive examinnions in thsir respect
ive offices, showing that these examinations,
anu me excellent quannc&uons or those admit
ted to the service through them, have had a
marked incidental effect upon the persons pre
viously in the service, and particularly upon
those aspiring to promotion. There has been
on the part of thoso latter an increased inter

The examinations have beon attended by many

oiuhiy investigate tho ecopo and character of
tho tests, and th3 method of determining the
results, and theso visitors have, without excep
tion, approved the modes employed, and several
of them have publicly afe.-ted thotr

I deem it my duty to renow tho recommenda

making promotions, such abuses as removal
without good cause and partisan and offi
cial interference with tho proper exercise of
the appointing power will in largo measure
disappear. There are other administrative
abuses to which the attention of Congress
should be asked in this connection. Mere
partisan appointment and the comsfant peril of

an absorbing and mlachioYnn nr.iid.i im.;.

Tho appropriation was not made, and, as a cou-
tial office, directly in accordance with the law ef
lb71 already cited, I endeavored, by i eguutiou
made on the 22d of June, 1877, to put fome
reasonable limits to such abiuo. It nuy
not bfc easy, and it may never, perhap, bo
necessary to define with precision tho proper
limit of political action on tho part of Federal
officers, liut, while their right to hold and
freely express their opinions cannot be ques
tioned, it is very plain that they should neither
be allowed to devote to ot er subjoct the time
needed for the proper discharge of their official
duties, nor to um the authority of their office to
enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the
political action of those who hold different
opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy
quite analogous to those which forbid tho use
of official power for the oppression of the pri
vate citizen impose upon tne Government the
duty of protecting its officers and asents from
arbitrary exactions. Iu whatever aspect con
sidered, the practice of making levies for
parly purposes upon the salaries of
officers is highly demoralizing to tho public
service and discreditable to the country.
Though an officer should bo as frto any other
citizen to give his money in aid of his opinions
or his party, he should also be as free as any
othei citizen to refute to make such gifts. If
salaries are but a fair compensation for the
time and labor of tho officers, it is gross injus
tice to levy tax upon them. If they are made
excessive in order that they may bear the tax,
the excess is an indirect robbery of the public
funds. I recommend, therefore, such a re
vision and extension of the present statutes as
shall secure- to thoso in every grade of official
life or public employment the protection with
which a great and enlightened nation shall
guard thoso who are faithful in its service.

Our relations wilh foreign countries have

are still unsettled questions, growing ou ot the
local laws of the maritime provinces, and the
actio u ot provincial authorities deemed to be in
derogation of rights secured by treaty to Amer

London ha& lo n instructed to present a de

of iho Dritish Government with a view to an
early and permanent settlement or the whole
queution, which was only temporarily adjusted
by tho treaty of Washington. Efforts have
been made to obtain the removal of restrictions

Tho assent of the Government has been given
to the landing on tho coast of Massachusetts of
a new and independent transatlantic cable be
tween Franco, by way of the French I-sland
of St. Pierre and this country, subject to any
future legislation of Congress on tho subject.
The conditions imposed, before allowing the
connection with our shore to be established,
are such as to socure its competition with any
existing or future lines of marine cable, and
precludo amalgamation therewith ; to provide
for entire equality of rights to our Gov
ernment and people with thoso of France
in the usa of the cable, and prevent any
exclusive possession of the privilege as ac
corded by Franco to tho disadvantage of any
future cable communication between France
and the United States which may be projected
aud accomplished by our citizens. An im
portant reduction of the present rates of
communication with Europe, felt to bo too bur
densome to tho interests of our commerce,
must necessarily flow from the estibli-hment
of tins competing line. Tho attention or Con
