CourU for the District of Oregon, in suita
ble cases, will, t a proper time, be sub
mitted to Congress. .
The attention of Congress is called to
the annual report of the Secretary of the
Treasury on the condition of thejublic
finances.
The ordinary revenues from all sources
for the fiscal vear ended June 30th, 1S79.
were $273,82? ,l4 46 ; tiie ordinary expen
ditures for the same period were $2C64",
8S3 53 ; leaving a surplus revenue for the
year, of $6,879,300 93.
The receipts of the present fiscal year,
endine June 30th, 18S0, actual and esti-
- mated, are as follows: Actual receipts
for the first quarter commencing Jnly 1st,
1889, $79,843,663 61 ; estimated receipts
for the remaining three quarters of t he
year, $208,156,336 39; total receipts for
the current fiscal year, actual and estimat
ed, $288,000,000. . .
The expenditures for the same period,
actual and estimated, as follows : t or tue
quarter commencing July 1st. 18.9, actcal
expenditures, $91,63,35 16; and for he
remaining three quarters of the year the
expenditures are estimated at fli-.-Jie,-614
90. making the total exyenditures
r4,000 000. and leaving an estimated
surplus revenue for the year ending June
86th, 1880, of $24,000,000. The total re
ceipts during the next fiscal year ending
Jnnp smh. 1881. estimated according to ex
isting laws, will be $238,000,000; and the
estimated ordinary expenditures for the
same period will be $273,0H7364 39, leav
ing a surplus of $9,902,635 61 for that
year.
The large amount expended for arears
of pensions during the last and the present
. . . . Ant OKI tin
nseal year, amounting to j:i,him ,
has prevented the application of the full
amount required by law to the sinking
fund for the current year; but these ar
rears having been substantially paid, it is
believed that the sinking fund can here
after be maintained without any change
of exisjing law.
The Secretary of War reports that the
War Department estimates for the fiscal
vear endine June 30th. 1881, are $40,380,-
428 93. the same being for a less sum of
money than any annual estimate render
ed to Uongres8 irom mat department dur
ing a period of at least twelve years.
He concurs with the General of the
Army in recommending such legislation
as will authorize the enlistment of the
full number of 25,000 men for the line of
the army, exclussve of the 3,463 men re
quired lor detached duty, and therefore
not available for service in the field.
He also recommends ' that Congress be
asked to provide by law for the disposi
tion of a large number of abandoned mili
tary posts and reservations which, though
verv valuable in themselves, have been
rendered useless for military purposes by
the advance of civilization and settle
ment.
He unites with the Quartermaster Gen
eral m recommending that an appropria
tion be made for the construction of a
cheap and perfectly fire-proof building
for the safe storage of a vast amount of
monev accounts, voucners, claims ami
other valuable records now in the Quar
termaster General's office, and exposed to
mat risk of total destruction by hre.
He also recommends in conformity
with the views of the Judge Advocate
General, some declaratory legislation in
reference to the military statute of limita
tions as applied to the crime ot aesertion.
In these several recommenuauons
concur.
THE EADS PASS.
The War reports
that the work for the improvement of the
South Pass of the Mississippi river, un
der contract with Mr. James B. Eads,
made in pursuance or an act of Congress,
has been prosecuted during the past year,
with a greater measure of success in the
attainment of results than during any
previous year. The channel throueh the
South Pass, which, at the beginning of
operations in June, 1875, had a depth of
only 7 and one-halt feet ot water, had, on
the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth
of twenty-six feet, having a width of not
less than 200 feet and a central depth of
thirty feet Payments have been made in
accordance with the statute, as the work
progressed, amounting in the aggregate
to $4,250,000; and further payments will
become due, as proviuea uy the statute,
in the event of success in maintaining
the channel now sec urea.
The reports of the General of the Army
and of his subordinates, present a full
and detailed account of the military op
erations for the suppression of hostilities
among the Indians of the Ute and Apache
tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the
officers and troops engaged, for prompt
ness, skill and courage displayed.
The past year has been one of almost
unbroken peace and quiet on the Mexican
frontier, and there is reason to believe
that the efforts of this Government and of
Mexico to maintain order in that region
will prove permanently successful.
This Department was enabled during
the past year to una temporary, though
crowded accommodations, and a safe de
pository for a portion of its records, in the
completed east wing of the building de
signed for the State, War, and Navy De
partments. Ihe construction of. the north
wing of the building, a part of the struc
ture intended for the use of the War De
partment, is being carried forward with
all possible dispatch, and the work should
receive from Congress such liberal appro
priations as will secure its speedy comple
THE NAVY.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows continued improvement in that
branch of the service during the last fiscal
year. Extensive repairs have been made
upon vessels, and two new ships have been
completed and made ready for sea.
The total expenditure of the year ended
June 30th, 1879, including specific appro
priations not estimated for by the depart
ment, were $13,o5o,710.uy. Ihe expenses
chargeable to the year, after deducting
the amount of the specific appropriations
were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to
reduction of $283,725.99. that amount
having been drawn upon warrants, but
pot paid out during the year. The amount
of appropriations applicable to the last
fiscal year was $14,538,646.17. There was,
therefore, a balance of $1,479,05437 re
maining unexpended, and to the credit of
the Department, on June 50tn, 1879. The
estimates for the fiscal year ending June
80th, 1881, are $14,864,147.95, which ex
ceeds the appropriations for the present
fiscal year $361,897.28. The reason for
this increase is explained in the Secretary's
report. The appropriations available for
the present hscal year are $14,502,250.67,
which will, in the opinion of the Secretary,
answer all the ordinary demands of the
service. The amount drawn from the
Treasury from July 1st to November 1st,
1879, was $5,770,404.12, of which $1,095,
440.33 has been refunded, leaving as the
expenditure for that period $4,674,963.79.
If the expenditures of the remaining two
thirds of a year do not exceed the propor
tion for these four months, there will re
main unexpended, at the end of the year,
$477,359.30 of the current appropriations.
The reDort of the Secretary sh owe t h irrft H.
fymg fact that among all the disbursing
omcars oi me pay corps or the navy there
is not one who is a defaulter to the extent
of a single dollar. I unite with him in
recommending the removal of the Observ
story to a more healthful location. That
institution renects credit upon the Nation,
and has obtained the approbation of sci
entific men in all parts of the world. Its
removal from its present location would
not only be conducive to the health of its
officers and professors, but would greatly
increase lis useiuiness.
UNITED STATES MARSHALS.
The appropriation for judicial expenses.

failed by reason of the absence of the re
quisite appropriation. This course of offi
cial conduct on the part of these officers,
highly creditable to their fidelity, was ad
vised by the Attorney, General, who in
formed them, however, that they would
necessarily have to rely tor their compen
sation upon the prospect of future legis
lation by Congress. I therefore especially
recommend that immediate appropriation
be made by Congress for this purpose.
The act making the principal appropria
tion for the department of Justice at pre
vious sessions has uniformly contained the
following clause: "A nd for defraying the
expenses which may be incurred in the en
forcement of the act approved February
est.h. ifian. pnmiH i.n . j .i

act approved May 30th, 1870,' entitled
An act to enforce the right of citizens of
the United States to vote in the several
States of the United States, and for other
purposes,' or any act amendatory thereof
jr supplementary thereto.' "
No appropriation was made for this pur
pose for the current year. As no
s-eueml . election for members of Con
gress occurred, the emission was a matter
of little practical iinjiortance. Such elec
tion will, however, take place aunug i
ensuing year, and the appropriation made
for the pay of AUrshalsanuaeuuiiessuo..
be sufficient to embrace compensation for
the services they may be required to per
form at such elections.
THE SUPREME COURT.
f huslnpss of the Supreme Court is, at
present, largely in arrears. It cannot be
expected that more causes can be decided
hn arc now disposed of in its annual
session, or that by any assiduity the dis
tinguished magistrates who compose the
court can accomplish more than is now
done. In the courts of munv of the cir
cuits, also the business has increased to
such an extent that the delay of Justice
will call the attention ol Congress to an
nnnmriate remedy. It is believed that
all is done in each circuit which can fairly
be expected from its judicial force. The
evil arising from delay are less heavily
felt by the United States than by private
suitors, as its causes are advanced by the
courts when it is seen that they involve the
discussion of questions of a public char
acter. The remedy suggested by the Attorney
ueneral is the appointment of
APDmOSAL CIRCUIT JUDGES,
and the creation of an intermediate Court
of Errors and Appeals, which shall relieve
the Supreme Court of a part of its juris
diction, while a larger force is also obtain
ed for the performance of circuit duties.
I commend this suggestion to the con
sideration of Congress. It would seem to
afford a complete remedy, and would in
volve, if ten additional Circuit Judges are
appointed, an expenditure, at the present
rate of salaries, of no more than $00,000 a
year, which would certainly be small in
comparison with the objects to be at
tended.
THE POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Postmaster General
bears testimony to the general revival of
business throughout the country, the
receipts of the Post-Office Department for
the hscal year ended June 6VLb, 1879, were
$30,041,982.86, being $764,465.91 more
than the revenues of the preceding year.
The amount realized from the sale of post
age stamps, stamped envelopes, and postal
cards, was $764,465.91 more than in the
preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more
than in 1877. The expenditures of the
Departmentwere $i 449,899. 45, of which
the sum ot f dib, 461.03 was paid on Iiabili
ties incurred in preceding years.
The expenditures during the year were
$801,209.77 less than in the preceding year.
This reduction is to be attnbuted mainly
to the operation of the law passed June
17th, 1878, changing the compensation of
postmasters from a commission on the
value ot stamps sold to a commission on
stamps canceled.
The amount drawn from the Treasury
on appropriations in addition to the reve
nues of the department was $3,031,454.96,
being $2,276,197.86 less than in the pre
ceding year.
The expenditures for the preceding year
ending June 3Uth, 1881, are estimated at
$39,920,900, and the receipts from all
sources at $32,210,000, leaving a deficiency
to be appropriated for out of the Treasury
-of $7,710,900.
The relations of the department with
railroad companies have been harmonized.
notwithstanding the general reduction by
Congress of their compensation, by the ap
propriation for special facilities, and the
railway post-office lines have been greatly
extended, especially in the Southern States.
The interests of the railway mail service
and of the public wouid be greatly promot
ed, and the expenditures could be more
readily controlled, by the classification of
employes of the railway mail service as
recommended by the Postmaster General,
the appropriation for salaries, with respect
to which the maximum limit is already
fixed by law, to be made in gross.
The Postmaster General recommends an
amendment of the law regulating the in
crease of compensation for increased ser
vice and increased speed on star routes, so
as to enable him to advertise for proosa!s
for such increased service and speed. He
also suggests the advantages to accrue to
the commerce of the country fromAhe en
actment or a general law authorizing con
tracts with American built steamers, carry
ing the American flag, for transporting
the mail between ports of the United
orates, and ports oi the Y est Indies and
South America at a fixed maximum price
per mile, the amount to be expended being
regulated by annual appropriations, in like
manner with the amount paid for the do
mestic siar service.
BOOKS IN THE FOREIGN MAILS.
The arrangement made by the Post
master ueneral and the Secretary of the
Treasury for the collection of duty upon
books received in the mail from foreign
countries have proved so satisfactory in its
practical operation that the recommenda
tion is now made that Congress shall ex
tend the provision of the act of March 3d.
1879, under which this arrangement was
made, so as to apply to all other dutiable
articles received m the mails from foreign
THE INDIANS.
The reports of the Secretary of the In
terior and the Commissioner of Indian Af
fairs, setting forth the present state of our
relations with the Indian tribes on our
territory, the measures taken to advance
their civilization and prosperity, and the
progress already achieved by them will be
iouhq oi more man ordinary interest.
The general conduct of our Indian popula
tion has been so satisfactory that the oc
currence of two disturbances, which re
sulted in bloodshed and destruction of
property, is all the more to be lamented.
RECENT OUTBREAKS.
of the outbreak on the
White River Ute reservation in Western
Colorado has become so familiar by elabo
rate reports in the public press that its re
markable incidents need not be stated here
in detail. It is expected that the settle
ment of this difficulty will lead to such ar
rangements as will prevent further hostile
contacts between the Indians and the bor
der settlements in Western Colorado.
The other disturbance occurred at the
Mescalero Agency, in New Mexico, where
v ictoria, the head of a small band of ma
rauders, after committing many atrocities,
being vigorously chased by a military force,
made his way across the Mexican border
and is now on foreign soil.
While these occurrences, in which a
comparatively small number of Indians
were engaged, are most deplorably a vast
majority of our Indian population have
fully justified the expectations of those
who believe by humane and peaceful influ
ences the Indians can be led to abandon
the habits of savage life and to develone a
capacity for useful and civilized occupa-
nous, n nat iney nave already accom
plished in the pursuit of asricultural and
mechanical work, the remarkable success
which has attended the experiment of em
ploying as freighters a class of Indians
hitherto counted among the wildest and
most intractable, and the general and
urgent desire expressed by them for the
education ot their children, may be taken
as sufficient proof that they will be found
capable of accomplishing much more if
they be wisely and fairly guided. The
"Indian policy" sketched in the report of
fV. c ... . e -u I -. . . ,
ma udjicLaij ui me iiiienor, roe OUject OI
which is to make liberal provision for the
education of the Indian youth, to settle
me inuians upon larm lot! in severalty,
to give them the title in fee to their farms,
inalienable for a certain number of years,
and when their wants are thus nmvili
for, to dispose by sale of the lands on their
reservations not occupied and used by
them, a fund to be formed out of the pro
ceeds for the benefit of the Indians, which
will gradually relieve the Government of
the expenses dow provided for by annual
appropriations, must commend itself as
just and beneficial to the Indians, and as
also calculated to remove those obstruc
tions which the existence of large reserva
tions presents io me settlement and devel
.opement of the country. I therefore
earnestly recommend the enactment of a
law enabling the Government to give In
dians a title in fee, inalienable for twenty
five years, to the farm lands assigned to
them by allotment. I also report the re
commendation maue in my first annual
message, that a law be passed admitting
Indians who can give satisfactory proof of
having, by their own labor, supported
their families for a number of years, and
who are willing to detalch themselves from
their tribal relations, to the benefit of the
homestead act, and to grant them patents
containing the same provision of inaliena
bility fcr a certain period.
EDUCATING THE INDIANS.
The experiment of spndinir r nnmhAi nf
Indian 'children, of both sexes, to the
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti
tute, in Virginia, to receive an elementary
English education and practical instm.-
tion in farming and other useful indus
tries, has led to results so promising that
it was thought expedient to turn over the
cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennslva
nia, to the Interior Department for the es
tablishment of an Indian school on a larger
scale. The school has now ioo pupiis, se
lected from various tribes, and is in lull
operation. Arrangements are also made
tor the education or a numoer oi inaiau
boys and girls belonging to tribes on the
pHcihc -lope, in a similar manner, at
Forest Grove, in Oregon. These institu
tions will commend themselves to the lib
erality of Congress and to the philanthro
pic mumncence or, the American people.
Last spring information was received of
organization of an extensive movement in
the Western States the objeet of which
was the occupation by unauthorized per
sons of certain land in the Indian Terri
tory ceded by the Cherokees to the Govern
ment for the purpose of settlemeut by
other Indian tribes.
On the 29th of April I issued a procla
mation warning all persons against par
ticipating in such an attempt, and by the
co-operation of a military force, the inva
sion was promptly checked. It is my
purpose to protect the rights of the Indian
inhabitants of that Territory to the full
extent of the Executive power. But it
would be unwise to ignore the fact that a
Territory so large and so fertile, with a
population so sparse and so great a wealth
of unused resources, will be found more
exposed to the repetition of such attempts
as happened this year, when the surround
ing States are more densely settled, and
the westward movements of our popula
tion looks still more eagerly for fresh
lands to occupy. Under such circum
stances the difficulty of maintaining the
Indian Territory in its present state will
greatly increase, and the Indian tribes in
habiting it would do well to prepare for
such a contingency. I therefore fully ap
prove ol the advice gtven to them ny rue
Secretary of the Interior on a recent occa
sion, to divide among themselves in sever
alty as large a quantity of lands as they
can cultivate, toacqmre muiviuuai iiue 111
fee instead of their tribal ownership in
common, and to consider in what manner
the balance of their lands may be dispos
ed of by the Goverement tor their beneht.
By adopting such a policy they would more
certainly secure for themselves the value
of their possessions, and at the same time
promote their progress in civilization,
than by endeavoring to perpetuate the
present state ol things in the lemtory.
CHANGING THE CONTROL.
The question whether a change in the
control of the Indian service should be
made was in the Forty-fifth Congress re
ferred to a joint committee of both
Houses for inquiry and report. In my
last annual message I expressed the hope
that the decision ot that question, then in
prospect, "would arrest further agitation
of this subject, such agitation being apt
to produce a disturbing effect upon the
service as wen as me Indians themselves.
Since then the committee have reported.
the question has been decided in the neg
ative by a vote in the House or Kepresen
tatives. .
For the reason here stated, and in view
of the fact that further uncertainty on
this point will be calculated to obstruct
other much needed legislation, to weaken
the decipline of the service and to unset
tle salutary measures now i l progress for
the government and improvement of the
Indians. I respectfully recommend that
the decision arrived at by Congress at its
last session be permitted to stand.
TIMBER LAND DEPREDATIONS.
The efforts made by the Department of
the Interior to arrest the depredations on
the timber lands of the United States have
been continued, and have met with con
siderable success. A large number of
cases ot trespass have been prosecuted in
the Courts of the United States; others
have been settled, the trespassers offering
to make payment to the Government for
the value of the timber taken by them.
The proceeds of the prosecutions and set
tlements turned into the treasury tar ex
ceed in amount the sums appropriated by
Congress for this purpose. A more im
portant result, however, consists in the
fact that the destruction of our public for
ests by depredation, although such cases
still occur, has been greatly reduced in
extent, and it is probable that if the pres
ent policy is vigorously pursued and suf
ficient provision to that end is made by
Congress, such trespass, at least those on
a large scale, can be entirely suppressed.
except in the Territories where timber
for the daily requirements of the popula
tion cannot, under the present state of the
laws, be otherwise obtained. I therefore
earnestly invite the attention of Congress
to the recommendation made by the Sec
retary of the Interior, that a law be en
acted enabling the Government to sell
timber from the public lands without con
veying the tee, where such lands are prin
cipally valuable for the timber thereon,
such sales to be so regulated as to con
form to domestic wants and business re
quirements, while at the same time euard-
ing against a sweeping destruction ol the
forests. The enactment of such a law ap
pears to become a more pressing necessity
AGRICULTURE.
mes
sages are renewed in favor of enlarging
the facilities of the Department of Agri
culture. Agriculture is the leading in
terest and the permanent industry of our
people. It is to the abundance of agri
cultural production, as compared with our
home consumption, and the largely in
creased and highly profitable market
abroad which we have enjoyed in recent
years, that we are mainly indebted for our
present prosperity as a people. We must
iook lor its continued maintenance to the
same substantial resource. There is no
hranch of industerv in which lahor di
rected by scientific knowledge, yields
such increased production in comparison
with unskilled labor, and no branch of
the public service to which the encour
agement of liberal appropriations can be
more appropriately extended. The omis
sion to render such aid is not a wise econ
omy; but, on the contrary, undoubtedly
results in losses of immense sums annual
ly that might be saved through well di-
rected efforts of the Government to
promote this vital interest.
The results already accomplished with
the very limited means heretofore placed
at the command of the Department of Ag
riculture is an earnest of what may be ex
pected with increased appropriations for
the several purposes indicated in the re
port of the Commissioner, with a view to
placing the Department upon a footing
which will enable it to prosecute more
effectively the objects for which it is es
tablished.
Appropriations are needed for a more
complete laboratory, for the establishment
of a veterinary division, and a division of
forestry, and for an increase of force.
The requirements for these and other
purposes, indicated in the report of the
Commissioner under the head of the im
mediate necessities of the Department.
will not involve any expenditure of money
that the country cannot with propriety
now undertake in the interests of agricul
ture.
EDUCATION.
It is STatifvin? to learn from ths Tin
reau of Education the extent to which ed
ucational privileges throuchout the
United States have been advanced during
the year. No more fundamental respon
sibility rests upon Congress than that of
devising appropriate measures of financial
aid to education, supplemental to local ac
tion in the States and Territories, and in
the .District ol Columbia. I he wise fore
thought of the founders of our Govern
ment has not only furnished the basis for
the support of our common school systems
of the newer States, but laid the founda
tions for the maintenance of their univer
sities and agriculture and the mechanic
arts. Measures in accordance with this
traditional policy for the further benefit
of all these interests, and the extension of
the same advantages to every portion of
me country, it is hoped, win receive your
iuvorauie cousiueraiiun.
NATIONAL LITERATURE.
To preserve and perpetuate the National
literature should be among the foremost
cares of the National legislature. The
library gathered at the Capitol still re
mains unprovided with any suitable ac
commodations for its rapidly increasing
stores, j ne magnitude and importance
of the collection, increased as it is by the
Jt j i . . -
uepusiis maue unuer me law oi copy
right, by domestic and foreign exchanges,
and the scientific library of the Smith
sonian institution, call for building ac
commodations which shall be at once ade
quate and fire-proof. The location of
such a public building, which should nro-
iuc mr iuc pressing necessities oi me
present, and lor me vast increase of the
Nation's books in the future, ia a matter
m hich addresses itself to the discretion of
congress. It is earnestly recommended
as a measure which should unite all suf
frages, and which should no longer be delayed.
WASHINGTON MONUMENT.
act of Congress of August 2d, 1876, for the
purixise of supervising and directing the
completion of the Washington National
Monument, of which Commission the
President is a member, has iriven careful
attention to this subject, 'and already the
strengthening of the foundation has so far
progressed as to insure the entire success
of this part of the work. A massive layer

of the work as may be necessary for the
completion of the National monument at
an early day.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
In former messages, impressed with the
importance of the subject, I have taken
occasion to commend to Congress the
adaption of a generous policy toward the
District of Columbia. The report of the
Commissioners of the District, herewith
tiansmitted, contains suggestions and
recommendations, to all of which I ear
nestly invite your careful attention. I
ask your early and favorable considera
tion of the views which they express as to
the urgent need of legislation for the re
claimation of the marshes of the Potomac
and its eastern branch, within the limits
of the city, and for the repair of the streets
of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden
blocks, and now by decay rendered al
most impassable, and a source of immi
nent danger to the health of its citizens.
The means at the disposal of the Commis
sioners are wholly inadequate tor the ac
complishment or these important worss,
and should be supplemented by timely
appropriations frorh the Federal Treasury.
The filling of the flats in front of the
city will add to the adjacent lands and
parks, not owned by the united states, a
large and valuable domain, sufficient it is
thought, to reimburse its entire cost,
and will also, as. aq incidental result, se
cure the permanent improvement of the
river for the purpose or navigation.
The Constitution having invested Con
gress with supreme and exclusive juris
diction over the District of Columbia, its
citizens must of necessity look to Congress
alone for all needful legislation affecting
their interests; and as the territory of this
district is the common ' property of the
people ot the Lnited states, who, equally
with its resident citiiena, ape interested in
the prosperity of their capital, I cannot
doubt that you will be amply sustained
by the general voice of the country in any
measure you may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration
of Congress to the want of the public
schools of this district, as exhibited in the
report of the commissioners. While the
number of pupils is rapidly increasing no
adequate provision exists lor a correspon
ding increase for school accommodation,
and the commissioners are without the
means to meet this urgent need. A mini
ber of the buildings now used for school

Friday Morning:, Dec 5, 1879,
Senator Tburman advances the theory
that the result in Ohio, was not a rebuke
to the course of his party in Congress.
Another prominant Republican negro
has been assassinated iu South Carolina,
but, as usual, politics has nothing to do
with it.
The hostile White River Utes refuse to
come in or surrender those who were en
gaged in the White River Agency massa
cre. The Commission has failed, there
fore, in the important object of its forma
tion. There is work for the soldiers.
Tne Western Female Seminary, at Ox
ford, in this State, has had the honor of
furnishing three of her graduates class
of 1878, for the missionary field. One of
these young ladies Miss Fannie Cundle,
of St. Louis, took her departure last week
from New York, for her station Tripoli,
Syna via London. The other two-
Miss Edna S. Cole, of St. Josephs, Mo.,
and Mary M. Campbell, of Lexington,
Ind. took their departure in October of
last year, for the Laos Mission, Siam
Chang-Mai being the particular locality.
These young ladies are said to have been
well fitted in scholorship and devoted
piety, for the life work to which they have
given themselves. Confidence is felt, that
they will honor their Alma Mater, while
they honor their Master and the cause of
religion.
The proposition to send Republican
stumpers down into Louisiana, is not
popularly fallen in with. Neither Sher
man or Blaine can find time to attend -to
it. Gen. Stewart, L. Woodford, however,
who defended Mrs. Chisholin in the trial
of Gully, in Mississippi, gallantly steps
forward and volunteers to embark in the
canvass, and has actually arrived there in
furtherance of that design. He reached
N. 0. on Tuesday last. The Picayune
gives him a rather gingerly reception, but
does not exactly welcome him with bloody
hands to a hospitable grave. The pro
gress of Mr. Woodford will be watched
with deep interest. The course ot South
era hospitality will, no doubt, be put to
its test, as that course will have its influ
ence upon public sentiment at the North
The case will be a marked one.
Congress. The second session of the
forty-sixth Congress, convened on Mon
day. The opening day proved a very
quiet and unimportant one. After listen
ing to the reading of the President's Mes
sage, both houses adjourned. The full
text of the message will be found in this
paper. It is more in extenso, than is
common with President Hayes. Most of
the subjects of National concern are re
viewed in that concise, frank and business
like manner that characterize the docu
ments of our present chief magistrate.
Nork enough is laid out for keeping the
members out of mischief up to the fourth
of March, but it will be two much to ex
pect, that it will take precedence of parti
san matters. In the language of a
Thanksgiving prayer reported to us, it
might with propriety be said "Oh Lord
if it is not too much to ask, baptise the
Congress, about to covene, with a spirit of
common sense."
There is a priest named Father Scully
in Cambridgport, Mass., who enforces the
duties of Catholic parents to send their
children to the parochial school, by the
anathemas of the church ex-communica
tion and exposure to perdition. Some of
the Catholics send their children to the
"Godless," free, public schools" and this
course is resorted to, to break up the pat
ronage. A case has been recently decid
ed in the courts, by heavy verdict, where
the institutions of the church were brought
to bear upon apostate Catholics, by influ
encing his trade and breaking down his
business, so that that course was found to
be a little expensive. This resort, there
fore, of stripping the delinquent of his
hopes of salvation, is. no doubt, believed
will reach the end without exposure. But
the papers tell us that some of the Massa
chusetts Catholics find that the public
schools are cheaper than the parochial
schools, and are of a much higher stan
dard and more beneficial to the children.
The parents are, therefore, defying Fath
er Scully's claims of holding the keys of
Heaven, and of admitting or excluding
whom he will from the blest abodes.
The world is suffering for want of elo
quence logic ligh t of the greenback
cast of thought. There is any amount of
room for electrical light effulgence and
the reticence that prevails, is hardly less
than reckless indifference. These are try
ing times for any one affected with paper
monomania, and if there is any panacea
laying around loose adapted to meet the
emergency, it should, by all means, be
brought into active application and opera
tion, without undue waste of time.

FOR 1880.
ESTABLISHED IX 1851.
The political coarse of the New Yoik Times
will be guided during the Presidential year by
tbe same princples which have won for it the
position of tbe foremost Republican newspaper
in the United States. The successful issue of
the recent contest in New York, aud the nnbio
ken series of Republican victories in other
Mortnern states wmca preceaea ana accompan
ied it. have combined to demonstrate the sound
ness of the position sf The Tikes in regard to
the questions with which tne Republican Party
is cailea upon to aeai.
Tbb Times will continue to place fidelity to the
interests ol tbe Republican Party above the pur
suit of pergonal aims of private ambition, and
will steadfastly insist that the usefulness of any
party must ne measnrea ny tne extent oi its devo
tion to the honor and weltare of the country. In
the future, as In the past, the attitude of the
Times will ne that oi independence wttnin tne
Republican Paity. The maintenance of the pub

reform; rigid economy in pnblic expenditures;

The Times will continue to be diptingulshed as
an enterprising, accurate and carefully edited
newspaper. The acknowledged excellence and

In the sphere of literary and artistic criticism,
of scientific, social, and general discussion. The
Times will address itself, aa heretofore, to the
appreciation of the educated and intelligent
Classes ol the American people. It will be lively
without being sensational; aggressive withont
beine coarse: at all times it will strive to be
feerleas and independent in the championship
of the right No theories subversive of the
principles on which the sacredncss of family

The Times rejects all advertisements of

of all other agencies by which tbe Insidious poi
son of vice is disseminated throughout society.
It will be in the future, as n the past, a news
paper especially adapted to family reading.
The Semi-Weekly Times is specially fitted to
