Arizona ANDl'HE LEAGUE OF THE SOUTHWEST
4 RIZONA, in concert with the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and
Wyoming, has demanded an'equal -vote with California in the meeting
of the League of the Southwest, now in session at Riverside. Forecast has
been made that the League will break up before the present meeting is con
cluded and, from the standpoint of many Arizona people, such action would
not be unpopular. Many citizens of this state feel that the subject of the
conference is largely the business of Arizona.
Fully alive to the value of Coloradorlver power, the people of Southern
California are extremely anxious that they get the lion's share of any re
sults of the. development that is proposed in northern Arizona. Hence the
League of the Southwest was importuned to take a hand in the matter and
to swing the pendulum in favor of that part of the country. New Mexico.
however, in company with Colorado, Utah and Wyoming are equally desirous
of sccuring'-benefits from the Colorado river. Arizona is merely looking on
while other .states, which hold practically none of the powe sites, are en
deavoring to loot the state's birthright.
Practically every power and dam site on the upper Colorado river is lo
cated within the confines of the state of Arizona.' WhUe Utah and New Mex
ico and even Colorado may have some claim upon the waters of that great
river, the major interest lies in this state. Yet we proceed to recognize the
interests of New Mexico, on account of the San Juan river touching a corner
of that state: the claims of Colorado for the same reason and those of Wy
oming and Utah and Nevada and California for similar reasons. Arizona sits
idly by and watches its neighbors dividing, or laying plans to appropriate
its wealth of power.
The League of the Southwest is high sounding in title. It had its incep
tion in Southern California and if there is anything the folks of that part of
r-nr,io o-n miont in. it Is the seizure and utilization of other people's
vaiiivi t it v - -
property. California, however, can not be beamed if Arizona is willing to
permit the steal to go forward.
' With the Grand Canyon's gigantic proportions looming entirely within
the borders of Arizona, the statue js Witnessing a strange sight. The people I
of California. NewelcV Colorado, Nevada L,tah apd Wyoming are put
ting thejr hands'; iji'to the pockets of Arizona's great resources. .Cooperation
there may be, between' the various states in the matter of the d3velopment
of the power and irrigation possibilities along the Colorado river, but it
should be cooperation with the state of Arizona leading the activity aud fully

PRISON BREAK
WATSON PEEVED
INTELLIGENT FEMINISM
JNTELLIGENT feminism, boiled down to its true essence, is not feminism
at ajl. It is humanity. That is the brand of feminism that is being
preached (and acted) by the one woman in congress, Miss Alice Robertson,
of Oklahoma. Curiously enough she has been the target of the "advanced"
feminists of the entire country.
"Of course all of the women's clubs are hammering me, because I will
not champion the so-called women's legislation bills to allow them to keep
their maiden names, after they are married and the like," said Miss Robert
son. "They are lambasting me because I wot'd not vote for the Shepard-
Towner maternity bill, which will not help the mothers of America a bit, but
will give a lot of jobs for others in the bureaus in Washington."
Miss Robertson has taken her congressional work seriously enough to
realize that she was elected- to represent a certain district in Oklahoma. She
was not selected to represent merely the women of that district (let alone
the women of el of the other districts of the country), nor yet the Republi
cans within the district.
"The women are against me because I was not for. suffrage originally,
but I don't mind. They did not vote for me and I was elected. When the
women were given the right to vote I contended they had entered politics on
a fifty-fifty basis, that they were not entitled to any special political consid
eration just because they were women," added Miss Robertson during her In
terview. "All these women agitators, who appear oerore ciuds wun meir
nice gowns and long gloves and look pretty so that the other women will sit
up and exclaim, "oh, isn't she wonderful!' make me wonder why some of
them did not raise some sons to have reverence for them. Men and women
are what their mothers make them."
Miss Robertson has definite ideas as to the attitude of women on wars,
pacifists and other contests:
Woman is no more pacifist than man. What playthings does the moth
er give her child? Toy pistols, tin soldiers and guns. Down in the soul of
every woman is pride or her warrior. It has been so from the time she used
hor hair to make bowstrings and handled her warrior his shield, on which
he was likely to be brought home dead ! confess that women like
to think of the prowess of their warriors, of their courage and valor on the
field of battle. The saying is often heard that women are more peaceful
than men. In a very large proportion of cases the women are the hardest
to pacify. I went to the Army-Navy football game in fie1 Ytrk
last week. While the battle was on more shrill voices of women were heard
than the deep cheers of the men. The women went crazy, but not one in a
hundred understood anything about the game. If they happened to be sit
ting in the navy seats there was nothing good at all In the grey uniforms
across the way."
Pretty severe for a congresswoman, the second to In etected in the his
lory of the United States! Miss Robertson declares she will be a candidate
to succeed herself in congress and is only doubtful of the outcome because
the "pie" has not been passed around in her part of Oklahoma. "There are
a lot of Republicans down in Oklahoma who arc mighty, hungry," d3clared
Miss Robertson.
All of which goes to prove that besid::; Vig a tru,'y advanced feminist.

plications providing that development

points of flood control, irrigation and
power development, in that order of

was prepared to finance it.

PHOENIX. Arir.. Dec. 9. The state
tax commission today indicated that
it would hojd that no emergency ex

except in a few instances, not total
ing more than $5,000. and that the
privilege of incurring indebtedness to
that extent might be allowed, the in
debtedness to be taken up in the next
tax levy.
Cochise county officials who ap
peared before the commission today
said that although there were ample
funds in the county treasury to con
duct the county's business, certain ac
counts had been overdrawn and under
the new budget law money could not
be transferred from one fund to an
other. They said there were more
than a million dollars in the treasury
but the road fund, meals for jurors
fund, expert auditing fund and others
had been depleted.
' The tax commission suggested that
although different items within a
fund might be exhausted, money
could be transferred from one item to
another within the same fund. Thus
it was said, the jurors' meals fund
really was part of the superior court
fund from which money could be tak
en for that expense.
