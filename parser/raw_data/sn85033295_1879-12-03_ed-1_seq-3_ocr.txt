cial duty, but is incompatible with the freedom
of elections. Not without warrant in the view
of several of my predecessors in the Presiden
tial office, directly in accordance with the law of
1871 already cited, I endeavored, by regulation
made on the 23a of June, 1877, to put some
reasonable limits to such abuses. It invy
not be easy, and it may never, perhaps, be
necessary to define with precision the proper
limit of political action on the part of Federal
officers. But, while their right to hold and
freely express their opinions cannot be ques
tioned, it is very plain that they should neither
be allowed to devote to other subjects the time
needed for the proper discharge of their official
duties, nor to use the authority of their office to
enforce their own opinions, or to coerce the
political action of those who hold different
opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy
quite analogous to those which forbid the use
of official power for the oppression of the pri
vate citizen impose upon tno Government the
duty of protecting its officers and agents from
arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect con
sidered, the practice of making levies for
party purposes upon the salaries of
officers is highly demoralizing to the public
service aud discreditable to the country.
Though an officer should be as free any other
citizen to give his money in aid of his opinions
or his pany. he should also be as free as any
othei citizen to refuse to make such gifts. Tf
salaries are but a fair compensation for the
time and labor of the officers, it is gross injus
tice to levy tax upon them. If they are made
excessive in order that they may bear the tax,
the excess is an indirect robbery of the public
funds. I recommend, therefore, such a re
vision and extension of the present statutes an
shall secure to those in every grade of official
life or public employment the protection with
which a great aud enlightened nation shall
guard those who are faithful in its service.
Foreign Relations.
Our relations with foreign countries have
oontinued peaceful. With Great Britain there
are still unsettled questions, glowing out ot the
local laws of the maritime provinces, and the
action ot provincial authorities deemed to be in
derogation of rights secured by treaty to Amer
ican fishermen. The United Stales Minister in
London has been instructed to present a de
mand for $105,3 '5 02 in view of the damages
received by American citizens at Fortune bay
on the 6th day of January, 1878. The subject
has been taken into consideration by the Brit
ish Government, aud an early reply is an
ticipated. Upon the completion of
the necessary preliminary examina
tion, the subject of our participation
in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by
treaty, will at once be brought to the attention
of the British Government with a view to an
early and permanent settlement oi the whole
question, which was only temporarily adjusted
by the treaty of Washington. Efforts have
been made to obtain the removal of restrictions
found injurious to the exportation of cattle to
the United Kingdom. Some correspondence
has also occurred with regard to the rescue and
saving of life aud property upon the lakes,
which has resulted in important modifications
of the previous regulatious of the Dominion
Government on the subject, in the interest of
humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution of
the last session of Congress, Commissioners
were appointed to represent the United States at
the two International Exhibitions in Australia,
one of which is now in progress at Sydney
and the other to be held next year at Mel
bourne. A desire has been expressed by inr
merchants and manufacturers interested in the
important and growing trade with Australia
that an increased provision should be made by
Congress for the representation of our indus
tries at the Milboume Exhibition of next year,
and the subject is respectfully submitted t<§
your favorable consideration.
The assent of the Government has been given
to the landing on the coast of Massachusetts of
anew and independent transatlantic cable be
tween France, by way of the French Island
of St Pierre and this country, subject to any
future legislation of Congress* on the subject.
The conditions imposed, before allowing the
connection with our shore to be established,
are such as to secure its competition with any
existing or future lines of marine cable, and
preclude amalgamation therewith ; to provide
for entire equality of rights to our Gov
ernment and people with those of France
in the use of the cable, and prevent any
exclusive possession of the privilege as ac
corded by France to the disadvantage of tiny
future cable communication between France
and the United States which may he projected
and accomplished by our citizens. An im
portant reduction of the present rates of
communication with Europe, felt to be too bur
densome to the interests of our commerce,
must necessarily flow from the establishment
of this competing line. The attention of Con
gress was drawn to the propriety of some gen
eral regulation by Congress of the whole sub
ject of transmarine tables by my pred
ecessor in his message of Dec. 7, 1875, and I
respectfully submit to your consideration the
importance of Congressional action in this
matter.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain, growing out of the incidents of the
Cuban insurrection, have been for the most
part happily and honorably settled. It may
reasonably be anticipated that the commission
now sitting in Washington for the decision of
private cases in this connection will soon be
able to bring its labors to a conclusion. The
long-standing question of the East Florida
claims has lately been renewed as a subject of
correspondence, and may possibly require
Congressional action for its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands with respect to
Consular rights and privileges similar to those
with other powers has been signed and ratified,
and the ratifications were exchanged on the
31st of July last.
Negotiations for extradition treaties with the
Netherlands and with Denmark are now in
progress.
Some questions with Switzerland in regard to
pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but
it is not doubted that they will be arranged upon
a just and satisfactory basis. A question has
also occurred with respect to an asserted claim
by Swiss municipal authorities to exercise tutel
age over the persons and property of Swiss citi
zens naturalized in this country. It is possible
this may require adjustment by treaty. With
the German empire frequent questions arise in
connection with the subjects of naturalization
and expatriation, but the Imperial Government
has constantly manifested a desire to strictly
maintain aud comply with all treaty stipulation e
in regard to them.
in consequence of the omission of Congress
to provide for a diplomatic representation at
Athens, the legation to Greece has been with
drawn. There is now no channel of diplomatic
communications between the two countries,
and the expediency of providing for one in
some form is submitted to Congress. Rela
tions with Austria, Prussia, Italy, Portugal,
Turkey, and Belgium continue amicable,
and marked by no incident of especial impor
tance.
A change of the personal head of the Govern
ment of Egypt has taken place. No change,
however, has occurred in tfie relations between
Egypt and the United States.
The action of the Egyptian Government in
presenting to the city of New York one of the
ancient obelisks which possess such historical
interest is highly appreciated as a generous
mark of international regard. If prosperity
should attend the enterprise of its transporta
tion across the Atlantic, its erection in a con
spicuous position in the chief commercial city
of the nation will be soon accomplished.
The treaty recently made between Japan and
the United States in regard to the revision of
former treaties, it is now believed, will be fol
lowed by similar action on the part of other
treaty powers. The attention of Congress is
again invited to the subject of the indemnity
lands received some vears since from Japan
and China, which, witii their accumulated in
terest, now amount to considerable sums. If
any part of these funds is justly due to
American citizens, they should receive it
promptly, and whatever may have been re
ceived by the Government in excess of strict
ly-just demands should in soma form be re
turned to the nations to whom it equitably
belongs. The Government of China has
signified its willingness to consider the
question of the emigration of its subjects to
the United States with a dispassionate fairness
and to co-operate in such measure as may tend
o prevent injurious consequences to the United
States. The negotiations are still proceeding,
aud will be pressed with diligence. A question
having arisen between China and Japan about
the Loochco islands, the United States Govern
ment has taken measures to inform those pow-
ers of its readiness to extend ite pood offices
for the maintenance of peace, if they shall mu
tually deem it desirable, and find it practicable
to avail themselves of the proffer.
It is a gratification to be able to announce
that, through the judicious and energetic ac
tion of the mi itary commanders of the two
nations on each side of the Rio Grande, uunor
the instructions of their respective Govern
ments, raids and depredations have greatly
decreased, and, in localities where they were
formerly destructive, have now almost wholly
ceased. In view of this result, I entertain a
confident expectation of the continuance of the
prevalence of quiet on the border of the two
countries.
The third installment of the award against
Mexico under the Claims Commission of July
4, 1808, was duly paid, aud has been nut in
course of distribution in pursuance of tne act
of Congress providing for the same. This sat
isfactory situation between the two countries
leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade
with Mexico, aud an increased contribution of
capital and industry by our people to the devel
opment of the great resources of that country.
I earnestly commend to the wisdom of Con
gress the provision of suitable legislation look
ing to this result.
Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is
again fully restored by the arrival of the Min
ister from that country to the United States.
This is especially fortunate in view of the fact
that the question of an interocoanic canal has
recently assumed an important aspect, aud is
now under discussion with the Central Ameri
[ can countries, through whose territory the
canal by the Nicaragua route would have to
pass. It is ti nsted that enlightened statesman
ship on their part will see that the early prose
cution of such a work will largely mure to the
benefit, not only of their own citizens and those
of the United States, but of the commerce of
the civilized world. It is not doubted that,
should the work be undertaken under the pro
tective auspices of the United States, and upon
satisfactory concessions for the right of way
and its security by the Central American Gov
ernments, the capital for its completion would
readily be furnished from this country and
Europe, which might, failing such guarantees,
Sroye inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with
hili have also been strengthened by the
reception of a Ministry from that country.
The war between Peru, Bolivia, and Chili,
still continues. The United States has not
; deemed it proper to interpose in the matter,
i further than to convey to all the Governments
■ concerned the assurance that the friendly offi
ces of the Government of the United States lor
the restoration of peace upon an honorable
basis will be extended in case the belligerents
shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cor
dial relations continue with Brazil and the Ar
i gentine Republie, and trade with those coun
tries is improving.
A provision for regular and more frequent
mail communication in our ships between the
ports of this country and the nations of South
America se^ms to me to deserve the attention
of Congress as an essential precursor of an en
largement of our commerce with them and an
extension of our carrying trade.
A recent revolution in Venezuela hss been
followed by the establishment of a Provisional
Government. This Government has not yet
been formally recognized, and it is deemed
desirable to await the proposed action of the
people, which is expected to give it the sanction
of constitutional forms.
A naval vessel has been sent to the Samoan
islands to make surveys and take possession of
the privileges ceded to the United States by
Samoa inj the harbor of Pago-Pago. A coaling
station is to be established there, which will be
convenient and useful to United States vessels.
The subject of opening diplomatic relations
with Roumania aud Servia, now become inde
pendent sovereignties, is at present under con
sideration, and is the subject of diplomatic cor
respondence.
There is a gratifying increase of trade with
nearly all European and American countries,
and it is believed that with judicious action in
regard to its development it can and will be still
more enhanced, and that American products
and manufactures will find new and expanding
markets. The reports of diplomatic and con
sular officers upon this subject, under the sys
tem now adopted, have resulted in obtaining
much valuable information, which has been,
and will continue to be, laid before Congress
and the public from time to time.
Condition of Alaska.
The third article of the treaty with Russia of
March 30, 1807, by which A1 iska was ceded to
the United States, provides that tne inhabitants
of the ceded ten ifory, with the exception of
the uncivilized native 'tribes, shall be admitted
to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of
the United Slates, and shall be maintained
and protected in the free enjoyment of their
liberty of property and religion. The unciv
ilized tribes are subject to such laws and
regulations as the United States may
from time to time adopt in regard to th*e
aboriginal tribes of the country. Both
the obligations of this treaty and thie necessi
ties of the people require that some organ
ized form of government over the Terri
tory of Alaska be adopted. There appears
to be no law for the arrest of persons
charged with common-law offenses, such as
assault, robbery, and murder, and no magistrate
authorized to issue or execute process in such
cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen
from offenses of this character, not only among
; citizens of the United States but of other coun
tries who have engaged in mining, fishing, and
' other business operations within the Territory,
i A bill authorizing the appointment of Justices
i of the Peace and constables, and the arrest
ard detention of persons charged with criminal
offenses, and providing for an appeal to United
; States courts for the District of Oregon of suita
ble cases will, at the proper time, be submitted
to Congress.
Public Finances.
The attention of Congress is called to the an
nual report of the Secretary of the Treasury on
the condition of the public finances. The or
dinary revenues from all soruces for the fiscal
year ended June 30,1879, were $273,827,184.46.
*rhe ordinary expenditures for the same period
were $366,947,083.53, leaving a surplus revenue
for the year of $6,879,300.93. The receipts for
the present fiscal year, ending June 3 *, 1880,
actual and estimated, are as follows: Actual
receipts for the first quarter, commenc
ing July 1, 1879, $79,843,663.61; es
timated receipts for the remaining
three-quarters of the year, $208,156,336.39.
Total receipts for the current fiscal year, act
ual and estimated, $288,000,000. The expend
itures for the same period will be, actual and
estimated, as follows: For the quarter com
mencing July 1, 1879, actual expenditures,
$91,683,385.10. For the remaining three-quar
ters of the year the expenditures are estimated
at $172,316,614.90, making the total expend
itures $264,000,000, and leaving an estimated
surplus revenue for the year ending June 30,
1880, of $24,000,000. I’he total receipts
during the next fiscal year ending
June 30, 1881, estimated according
to existin? laws, will be $288,000,000,
and the estimated ordinary expenditures for the
same period will oe $278,097,364.39, leaving a
surplus of $9,902,635.61 for that year. The
large amount expended for arrears of pensions
during the last and present fiscal years,
amounting to $21,747,249,60, has prevented the
application of the full amount required by law
to the sinking fund for the current year, but,
these arrears having been substantially paid, it
is believed that the sinking fund can hereafter
be maintained without any change of the exist
ing law.
Army and Navy.
The Secretary of War reports that the War
Department estimates for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1881, are $40,380,428.93, the same be
ing for a less sum of money than any annual
esrimate rendered to Congress from that de
partment during a period of at least twelve
years. He concurs with the General of the
Army in recommending such legislation as
will authorize the enlistment of the full num
ber of 25,000 men for the line of the army,
exclusive of the 3,460 men required for de
tached duty, and therefore not available for
service in the field. He also recom
mends that Congress be asked to pro
vide by law for the disposition of a
large number of abandoned military posts and
reservations, which, though very valuable in
themselves, have been rendered useless for
military purposes by the advance of civiliza
tion and settlement He unites with the Quar
termaster General in recommending that an
appropriation be made for the construction of
a clieap and perfectly fire-proof building for
the safe storage of a vast amount of money,
accounts, vouchers, claims and other valuable
records now in the Quartermaster General’s
office, and exposed to great risk of total de
sti notion by fire. He also recommends, in con- i
formity with the views of the Judge Advocate
General, some declaratory legislation in .refer
ence to the military statute of limitation*, as
applied to the crime of desertion. In tlicae
several recommendations I concur.
The Secretary of War further reports that
the work for the improvement in the South
pass of the Mississippi river, under contract
with Mr. James B. Eads, made in pursuance of
an act of Congress, has been prosecuted dur
ing the past year with a greater measure of
success in the attainment of results than dur
ing any previous year. The channel through
the South pass, which, at the beginuin< of
June, 1875, had the depth of only seven and a
half feet of water, had, on the Bth of Juiv,
1879, a minimum depth of twenty-six feet, hav
ing a width of not less than twenty-five and a
central depth of thirty feet. Payments have
been made in accordance with the statute as
the work progressed, amounting in the
aggregate to $4,250,000, and further payments
will become due, as provided by the statute and
in the event of success in maintaining the
channel now secured. The reports of the Gen
eral of the Army and of his subordinates pre
sent a full and detailed account of the military
operations for the repression of hostilities
among the Indians of the Ute and Apache
tribes, and praise is justly awarded to the offi
cers and troops engaged for promptness, skill,
and courage displayed. The past year has
been one of almost unbroken peace and quiet
on the Mexican frontier, and there is reason to
believe that the efforts of this Government and
Mexico to maintain order in that region will
prove eminently successful.
This department was enabled during the
past year to Hud temporary, though crowded,
accommodations and a safe depository for a
portion of its records In the completed East
wing of the building designed for the State,
War and Navy Departments, The construc
tion of the North wing of the building—a part
of the structure intended for the use of the War
Department—is being carried forward with all
possible dispatch, and the work should receive
from Congress such liberal appropriation as
will secure its speedy completion.
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
shows continued improvement in that branch
of the service during the last fiscal year. Ex
tensive repairs have been made upon vessels,
and two ships have been completed and made
ready for sea. The total expenditure of iho
year ended June 30, 1879, including specific ap
propriations not estimated for by the depart
ment, were $13,555,710.09. The expenses
chargeable to the year, after deducting the
amount of these special appropriations,
were $13,343,317.79; but this is subject to
a reduction of $283,725.97, that amount
having been drawn upon warrants, but
not paid out during the year. The amount of
appropriations applicable to the last fiscal
year was $14,538,046.17. There was, there
fore, a balance of $1,479,064.37 remaining
unexpended and to the credit of the
department on Juno 30, 1879. The esti
mates for the year ending June 30,1881, are
$14,804,147.95, which exceed the appropria
tions for the present fiscal year $301,8u7.28.
The reason for this increase is explained
in the Secretary's report. The appro
priations available for the pi’esent fiscal
year are $14,502,250.07, which will, in the
opinion of the Secretary, answer all the ordina
ry demands of the service. The amount drawn
from the treasury from July 1 to Nov. 1, 1879,
was $5,770,404 12, of which $1,095,440.33 has
been refunded, leaving as the expenditure for
that period $4,074,903.79. If the expenditures
of the remaining two-thirds of the year do not
exceed the proportion for these four months,
there will remain unexpended at the end of
the year $477,359 30 of the current appropria
tions.
The report of the Secretary shows the grati
fying fact that, among all the disbursing
officers of the pay corps of the navy, there is
not one who is a defaulter to the extent of a
single dollar. 1 unite with him in recommend
ing the removal of the Observatory to a more
healthful location. That institution reflects
credit upon the nation, and has obtained the
approbation of scientific men in all parts of the
world. Its removal from its present locality
would not only be conducive to the health of
its officers aud professors, but would
greatly increase its usefulness.
United States Marshals.
The appropriation for judicial expenses which
has heretofore been made for the Department
of Justice in gross was subdivided at the last
session of Congress, and no appropriation
whatever was made for the payment of the
fees of Marshals and their deputies either in
the service of process or for the discharge of
other duties, and since July 30 these officers
have continued the discharge uf their duties
without compensation from the Government
taking upon themselves the necessary incidental
outlays as well as rendering their own services.
In only a few unavoidable instances has the
proper execution of the process of the United
States failed by reason of the absence of
the requisite appropriation. This course
of official conduct on the part of the officers,
highly creditable to their fidelity, was advised
by the Attorney General, who informed them,
however, that they would necessarily have to
rely for their compensation upon the prospect
of future legislation by Congress. 1 there
fore especially recommend that immediate
appropriation be made by Congress for this pur
pose. The act making the principal appropria
tion for the Department of Justice at previous
sessions has uniformly contained the following
clause: “And for defraying the expenses
which may be incurred in the enforcement
of the act approved Feb. 28, 1870, entitled
*An act to amend an act approved May
30, 1870,’ entitled ‘An act to enforce the right
of citizens of the United States to vote in the
several States of the United States, and for
other purposes,’ or any acts amendatory there
of or supplementary thereto.” No appropria
tion was made for this purpose for the current
year. As no general election of members of
Congress occurred, the omission was a matter
of little practical importance. Such election
will, however, take place during the ensuing
year, and the appropriation made for the pay
of Marshals and deputies should be sufficient
to embrace compensation for the services they
may be required to perform at such election.
The Courts.
The business of the Supreme Court is
at present largely in arrears. It can
not be expected that more causes
can be decided than are now disposed of in its
annual session, or that by any assiduity the dis
tinguished Magistrates who compose the court
can accomplish more than is now done.
In the courts of many of tbe’circuits, also, the
business has increased to such an extent that
tlae delay of justice will call the attention of
Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is
believed that all is done in each cir
cuit which can be fairly expected from its
judicial force. The evils arising from delay
are less heavily felt by the United
States than by * private suitors, as its
causes are advanced by the courts when
it is seen that they involve the discussion
of questions of a miblic character. The remedy
suggested by the Attorney General is the ap
pointment or additional Circuit Judges, and the
creation of an intermediate Court of Errors and
Appeals, which shall relieve the Supreme Court
of a part of its jurisdiction, while a larger force
is also obtained for the performance of circuit
duties. I recommend this suggestion to the
consideration of Congress. It would seem to
afford a complete remedy, and would involve, if
ten additional Circuit Judges are appointed, an
expenditure at the present rate of salaries of
not more than $60,000 a year, which would cer
tainly be small in comparison with the objects
to be attained.
The Postofflco.
The report of the Postmaster General bears
testimony to the general revival of business
throughout the country. The receipts of the
Poetoffico Department for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1879, were $30,041,982.86, being
$764,465.91 more than the revenues of the
preceding year. The amount realized from the
sale of postage-stamps, stamped envelopes
and postal-cards was $764,465,91 more than in
the preceding year, and $2,387,559.23 more ban
in 1877. The expenditures of the department
were $33,449,899.45, of which the sum of
$376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in
preceding years. The expenditures during the
year were $801,209.77 less than in the preced
ing year. This reduction is to be attributed
mainly to the operation of the law passed June
17, 1878, changing the compensation of Post
masters from a commission on the value of
stamps sold to a commission on the stamps can
celed. The amount drawn from the treasury
on appropriations, in addition to the revenue's
of the department, was $3,031,454 94, being
$2,276,197.86 less than in the preceding year.
The expenditures for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1881, are estimated at $39,920,000. aud the
receinte from all sources at $32,210,000, leaving
a deficiency to be appropriated for out of the
treasury of $7.710;900. * The relations of the
department with the railroad companies have
been harmonized, notwithstanding the general
reduction by Congress of their compensation
by the appropriation for genera'! facilities, and
the railway postal lines have been greatly
extended, especially in the Southern States.
J ao interests of the railway mail service would
promoted and the expenditures
could be readily controlled by the classification
of the employee of the railway mail ser
vice, as recommended by the Postmaster Gener
al. the appropriations for service with respect
to which the maximum limit is already fixed
by law to be made in gross. The Postmaster
General recommends an amendment to the law
regulating an increase of compensation for in
creased service’ and increased speed on star
routes, so as to enable him to advertise for
such increased service and speed. Ho also
suggests the advantages to accrue to the com
merce of the country from the enactment of a
general law authorizing contracts with
American built steamers carrying the Amer
ican flag for transporting the mail
between the United States and parts of the
West Indies and South tAmerica at a fixed
maximum price per mile, the amount to be
expended being regulated by annual appropria
tions in like manner with the amount for the
domestic star service. The arrangement made
Si, Poßthfr&stcrJGeneral and the Secretary
of the Treasury for the collection of duties on
books received in the mail from foreign coun
tries has proved so satisfactory in its practical
operation that the recommendation is now
made that Congress extend the provisions of
the act of March 8, 1879, under which this
arrangement was made, so as to apply to all
other dutiable articles received in the mails
from foreign countries.
The Indians.
The reports of the Secretary of the Interior
and of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
sotting forth the present state of our relations
with the Indian tribes on our territory, the
measures taken to advance the civilization and
prosperity, and the progress already achieved
by them, will be found of more than ordinary
interest. The general conduct of our Indian
population has been so satisfactory that the oc
currence of two disturbances which resulted
in bloodshed and destruction of property is
all the more to be lamented. The history of
the outbreak on the White River Ute Reserva
ti°n. in Western Colorado has become so
familiar by elaborate reports in the public
press that its remarkable incidents need not be
stated here in detail. It is expected that the
settlement of this difficulty will lead to such
arrangements as will prevent further hostile
contests between the Indians and the border
aettlements in Western Colorado. The other
disturbances occurred at the Moscalero Agency
in New Mexico, where Victoria, the head of a
I small band of marauders, after committing
many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a
military force, made nis way across the
Mexican border, and is now on a
foreign soil. While these occurrences,
in which a comparatively small number of
Indians were engaged, are most deplorable, a
vast majority of our Indian population have
fully justified the expectations of those who
believe that by humane and peaceful influ
ences the Indian can be led te abandon the
habits of savage life, and to develop a capacity
for useful and civilized occupations. What
they have already accomplished is shown in the
pursuit of agricultural and mechanical work.
The success which has attended
the experiment of employing as freighters a
class of Indians hitherto counted among the
wildest and most intractable, and the
general and urgent desire expressed by
them for the education of their children, may
be taken as sufficient proof that they will be
found capable of accomplishing much more
if they continue to be wisely and fairly guided.
The Indian policy sketched in the report of the
Secretary of the Interior, the object of which is
to make liberal provision for the education of
Indian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm
lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to
their farms inalienable for a certain number of
years, and when their wants are thus provided
for to dispose by sale of the lands on their
reservations not occupied and used by them,
a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for
the benefit of the Indians, whicn will grad
ually relieve the Government of the expenses
now provided for by annual appropriations,
must commend itself as just and bened iai
to the Indians and as also calculated to
remove those olstructions which the exi tence
of larg3 reservations presents to the setdement
and development of the country. I, therefore,
earnestly recommend the enactment of a law
enabling the Government to give Indians a title
in fee inalienable for twenty-five years to the
farm lands assigned to them by allotment. I
also repeat the recomme idation in my first
annual me sage thatfa law ba passed admitting
Indians w ho can give satisfactory proof of hav
ing, by their own laoor, supported their fami
lies fora number of years, and who are will
ing to detach themselves from their tribal re
lations, to the benefit of the Homestead act,
and to grant them patents containing the same
provision of inalienability for acer ain period.
The experiment of sending a number of In
dian children of both sexes to the Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute in Virginia,
to receive elementary English education and
practical instruction in farming and other use
ful industries, has led to results so promisir g
that it was thought expedient to turn over t> e
cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in Pennsylvania
to tbs Interior .Department for the establish
ment of an Indian school on a larger scale.
This school has now 158 pupils, selected from
various tribes, and is in full operation. Ar
rangement are also made for the education of
a number of Indian boys and girls belonging
to tribes on the Pacific slope in a similar man
ner, at Forest Grove, in Oregon. These insti
tutions will commend themselves to the liberal
ity of C ingress and to the philanthropic munifi
ct nee of the American people.
Hast spring information was received of the
organization of an extensive movement in the
Western States, the object of which was the oc
cupation by unauthorized persona of certain
lands in the Indian Territory ceded by the
Cherokees to the Government for the purpose
of settlement by other Indian tribes. On the
29th of April I issued a proclamation warning
all persons against participation in such an at
tempt, and by the co-operation of a military
force the invasion was promptly checked. It is
my purpose to protect the rights of the Indian
inhabitants of that Territory to the full extent
of the Executive: but it would be un
wise to ignore tne fact that a Territory
so large and so fertile, with a population so
sparse, and so great a wealth of unused re
sources, will be found more exposed to the rep
etition of such attempts as happened this year
when the surrounding States were most densely
settled, and the westward movement of our
population looks still more eagerly for fresh
lands to occupy. Under such circumstances
the difficulty of maintaining tne Indian Terri
tory in its present state will greatly increase, and
the Indian tribes inhabiting it would do well to
prepare for such a contingency. I therefore
fully.approve of the advice gren to them by
the Secretary of the Interior on a recent
occasion to divide among themselves, in sev
eralty, as large a Quantity of their lands as
thev can cultivate, to acquire individual title
in fee, instead of their present tribal owner
ship in common, and consider in what manner
the balance of their lands may be disposed of
by the Government for their benefit By
adopting such a policy they would more cer
tainly secure for themselves the value of their
possessions, and at the same time promote
their progress in civilization and prosperity,
than by endeavoring to perpetuate the present
state of things in the Territory.
The question whether a change in the control
of the Indian service should be made was, in
the Forty-fifth Congress, referred to a joint
committee of both houses for inquiry and
report. In my last annual message I expressed
the hope that the decision of the question, then
iu prospect, would arrest further agitation of
this subject, such agitation being apt to pro
duce a disturbing effect upon the service as well
as the Indians themselves. Since then, the com
mittee having reported, the question has been
decided in the negative by a vote in the
House of Representatives. For the reason
here stated, and in view of the fact that fur
ther uncertainty on this point will be calculated
to obstruct other much-needed legislation, to
weaken the discipline of the service and to un
settle salutary measures now in progress for
the government and improvement of the In
dians, I respectfully recommend that the de
cision arrived at by Congress at its last session
be permitted to stand.
Timber Thefts.
The efforts made by the Department of the
Interior to arrest the depredations on the timber
lauds of the United States have been continued,
and have mat with considerable success. A large
number of cases of trespass have been prose
cuted in the courts of the United States.
Others have been settled, the trespassers offer
ing to make payment to the Government for
the value of the timb3r taken by them. The
proceeds of these prosecutions and seftK Tne,^ a
turned into the treasury far exceed in aruouiv f “*e
sums appropriated by Congress for pv r "
po?e. A more important result, however, cwv *
slats in the fact that the destruction of orf r
pubi c forests by depredation, although snrb
cases still occur, has been greatly reduced in
extent, and it ie proposed that if the present
policy is vigorously pursued, and sufficient
provision to that end made by Congress, such
trespass*—at least those on a large scale—can
be entirely suppressed, except in the Ter
ritories, where timber for the daily require
ments of the population cannot, under tho
present state of tise Jaw, he otherwise
obtained. I therefore earnestly invite the at
tention of Congress to tho recommendation
made by the Secretary of the Interior, that a
law be enacted enabling tbe Government to sell
timber frora the public lands without c©nvey
ing the fee where such lands are principally
valuable for the timber thereon, such sales to
ho o regulated as to conform to domestic
wants ami business requirements, while at the
same time guarding against a sweeping de
struction of the forests. .The enactment of such
a law appears to become a more pressing ne
cess ty every day.
Agricultural Bureau.
My recommendations in former messages are
renewed in favor of enlarging the facilities of
the Department of Agriculture. Agriculture
is the leading interest and the permanent in
dustry of our people. It is to the abundance of
agricultural productions as compared with onr
home coi.simption and the largely increased
and highly-profitable market abroad which we
have enjoyed in recent years that we are main
ly indebted for our present prosperity as a
people. We must look to its continued main
tenance for substantial resource. There is no
branch of industry in which labor, directed
by scientific knowledge, yields such in
creased production in comparison with unskilled
labor, and no branch of the public service to
which the encouragement of liberal appropria
tions can be more appropriately extended.
The omission to render such aid is not a wise
economy, but on the contrary undoubtedly re
sults in losses of immense sums annually that
might be saved through well-directed efforts
by the Government to promote this vital
interest. The result already accomplished
with the very limited means heretofore placed
at the command of the Department of Agri
culture is an earnest of what may be expected
with increa°ed appropriations for the several
purposes indicated in the report of the
Commissioner, with a view to placing the de
partment upon a footing which wi 1 enable it
to prosecute more effectively the objects for
which it is established. Appropriations are
needed for a more complete laboratory, for the
establishment of a Veterinary Division and a
Division of Forestry, and for an increase of
force. The requirements for these and other
purposes indicated in the report of the Commis
sioner, under the head of “Immediate Neces
sities of the Department ” will not involve any
expenditure of money that, the country cannot
with propriety now undertake in the interests
of agriculture.
Education.
It is gratifying to learn from the Bureau of
Education the extent to which educational
privileges throughout the United States have
been advanced during the year. No more
fundamental responsibility rests upon Congress
than that of devising appropriate measures of
financial aid to education, supplemental
to local action in States and Terri
tories, and in the District of Colum
bia. The wise forethought of the founders
of our Government has not only furnished the
basis for the support of the common-schcol
systems of the newer States, but laid founda
tions for the maintenance or their universities,
®f colleges of agriculture and mechanic art.
Measures in accordance with this traditional
policy for the further benefit of all tbese in
terests and the extension of some advantages
to every portion of the country, it is hoped,
will receive your favorable consideration.
Capitol Library.
To preserve and perpetuate the national lit
erature should be among the foremost cares of
the national Legislature. The library gathered
at the Capitol still remains unprovided with any
suitable accommodations for its rapidly-increas
ing stores. The magnitude and importance of
the collection, increased, as it is, by the deposits
made under the laws of copyright, by domes
tic and foreign exchanges, and by the scientific
library of the Smithsonian Institution, call
for building accommodations which shall
be at once adequate and fire-proof. The loca
tion of such public buildings, which shonid
provide for the piessing necessities of the
present and for the vast increase of the na
tion’s books in the future, is a matter which
addresses itself to the discretion of Congress.
It is earnestly recommended at a measure
which should unite all suffrages, and which
should no longer be delayed.
Wagl ington Monument.
The Joint Commission created by the act of
Congress of Aug. 2, 1876, for the purpose of
supervising and directing the completion of the
Washington National monument, of which
commission the President is a member, has
given careful attention to this subject, and al
ready the strengthening of tho foundation has
so far progressed as to insure entire success
of this part of the work. A massive layer of
masonrj - has beep introduced below the origi
nal foundation, widening the base, increasing
the stability of the structure, and rendering it
possible to carry the shaft to completion. It
is earnestly recommended that such further
appropr ation be made for the continued
prosecution of the work as may be necessary
i or the completion of this national monument
at an early day.
District of Columbia.
In former messages, impressed with the im
portance of the subject, I have taken occasion
to recommend to Congress the adopuon of a
generous policy toward the District of Colum
bia. The report of the Commissioners of the
District herewith transmitted contains sugges
tions and recommendations to all of which I
earnestly invito your careful attention. I ask
your early and favorable consideration of the
views which they express as to urgent need of
legislation for the reclamation of the marshes of
the Potomac and its eastern branch within the
limits of the city, and for the repair of streets
of the capital, heretofore laid with wooden
blocks, and by delay rendered almost impass
able and a source of imminent danger to the
health of its citizens. The means at the dis
posal of the Commissioners are wholly inade
quate for the accomplishment |of these imp >r
tant works and should be supplemented by
timely appropriations from the Federal treas
ury, The filling of the flats iu front of the city
will add to the adjacent lands and parks now
owned by the United States a large and valuable
domain, sufficient, it is thought, to reimburse
its entire cost, and will also, as an incidental
result, secure the permanent improvement of
the river for the purpose of navigation.
The constitution having invested Congress
with supreme and exclusive jurisdiction over
the District of Columbia, its citizens must, of
necessity, look to Congress alone for all need
ful legislation affecting their interests, and as
the territory of this District is the common
property of the people of the United States,
who, equally with its resident citizens, are in
terested in the prosperity of their capital, I
cannot doubt that you will be amply sustained
by the general voice of the country in any
measure yon may adopt for this purpose.
I also invite the favorable consideration of
Congress to the wants of the public schools of
this District, as exhibited in the report of the
Commissioners. While the number of pupils
is rapidly increasing, no adequate provision
exists for a corresponding inci ease of school
accommodation, and the Commissioners are
without the means to meet this urgent need,
A number of the buildings now used
for school purposes are rented, and
are in important particulars unsuited for the
purpose. The cause of popular education in
the District of Columbia is surely entitled to
the same consideration at the h*nds of the
National Government as in the several States
and Territories, to which munificent grants of
the public lands have been made for the en
dowment of schools and universities.

“ I protest against my sentence,” re

“And why?” asked his custodian.
“ Because,” said the prisoner, “ I have
served two terms in that prison, and 1
do not favor a third term on principle.”

ARMY REPORTS.
Recommendations of Gens. Hancock, Mc-
Dowell, Schofield Pope and Ord,
JVfaj.
Gen. W. 8. Hancock, commanding the
ffirilitk Ty Division offthe Atlantic, in his annual
report .among other recommendations, asks at
tention td'A suggestion of a Maj. Arnold as to
the propriety of the paswge of a law retiring
3hose ordnancd sergeants of the army who
have merited aucb a privilege by years of con
tinuous meritorious service. He concurs in
tha, and also in the recommendation of the
Inspector General of tbs divi-ion, that such a
law should apply to all old and deserving ser
geant in the army line and staff. A sea-wall
around Governor's island is earnestly advo
cated.
Maj. Gen. McDowell’s report of tho military
operations in the Division of the Paaiflc is a*
long and interesting document He gives v
detailed statement ®f the operations in me sev
eral detachments of that division. Ho urge
an early survey of the new reservation on* the’
Salinas for those interesting Indians, th
Fimas, Mancopas and Papagos. He asks th
attention of the War Department to the imper
fect armament of the sea-coast defenses in his
division, the guns being old style, and not suffi
cient in number or condition. He devotes
much space to the subject of rifle practice.
The improvement in marksmanship has been
very decided.
Maj. Gen. Schofield, Superintendent anc£
Commandant at West Point, m his annual re
port says that the instruction in the several de
partments of the West Point Academy during
the past year has been fully up to the previous
high standard of the institution, and the prog
ress of the several classes satisfactory. It m
gradually yielding to the more enlightened and
refined sentiments which govern the relations
between young men of the present day. The
change introduced two years ago by the res
toration of instruction in the English language
in the first year’s course has proved beneficial.
It is requisite that young officers should be
given reasonable facilities and encourage
ment in all arms of the service, and
to continue their professional studies
in connection with the practical
application of military principles. Without
such opportunities little further progress is
generally made after leaving the academy, and
much that has been learned is soon lost Such
opportunities are now presented for a post
graduate course of studies to the youug officers
who are detailed as instructors at West Point,
and to those who enjoy the benefits of the ar
tillery school at Fortress Monroe. The appor
tionment of cadetships among the States
and Territories, he thinks, is so just a
feature that it cannot be sacrificed for
the purpose of securing a higher stand
ard of admission. Yet there seems to be
no reason why, if there are any candidates who
possess much higher qualifications than tho
standard requires, they may not be given the
full benefit of their superior attainments by be
ing admitted to a higher class in the academy.
He suggests, for the consideration of Congress,
that the facilities offered by the Military Acade
my might, at slight additional cost, be made
available for the education of a considerable
number of young men in excess of the annual
vacancies in the army, to be returned to their
respective States for service in the organized
militia.
Brig Gen. Pope, who commands the Depart
ment of the Platte, in speaking of the Utes,
says it is no longer possible to leave them
where they are without constant collision and
outrage on the part of both whites and Indians.
All military efforts of the Government to arrest
the movement of immigrants to the great Ute
reservation must be both futile and prejudicial
to both the General Government; and the State
of Colorado. The time has come when the
safety of both whites and Utes demands some
change of location for these Indians. He rec
ommends the consolidation of the Utes on the
headwaters of the west fork of the Obama and
along the valley of the Navajo. He condemns
the new reservation selected by the commission
sent out last year as being open to all objec
tions to be urged against the present one.
Gen. K C. Ord, who commands the military
Department of Texas, states that all the In
dians who have penetrated that country have
been so hotly pursued by troops as to prevent
their doing much damage. There have been
only three murders by marauders during the
year. Last year there were seventeen in the
region referred to. Good order in Mexico and
the cessation of raids from tha* country have
enabled a considerable portion of the troops held
in reserve to carry out the order of the Presi
dent dated Jan. 1, 1877, to cress the border in
pursuit of raiders, to be diverted for use in
exploring our own wild country, and occupy
ing water-holes frequented by raiding bands
from our own Indian reservations. An appro
priation of $200,000 for four additional posts
needed to replace those vacated is very earn
estly recommended for the accommodation of
eleven counties now unprovided for.
THE PENSION OFFICE.
Commissioner Bentley’s Annual Report*
Hon. J. A. Bentley, Commissioner of Pen
sions, has completed his annual report to the
Secretary of the Interior. It shews that on the
30th of June last there were 242,755 persons in
the United Skates receiving pensions from the
Government The pension-list is now larger
than at any previous time. The present list is
composed of 125,150 army invalid pensioners,
81,174 army widows, children, and depehdenl
relatives, 1,844 navy invalids, 1,772 navy
widows, etc., 11,621 surviving soldiers of the
war of 1812, and 21,194 widows of deceased
soldiers of that war. During the year 31,346
new names were added to the list, and 908
names which had previously been dropped
from the rolls, mainly from failure for three
years to claim their pension", were restored,
and 13,497 were, for various reasons, dropped.
The aggregate amount of one year’s pension
to all pensioners on the rolls is $25,493,742.15,
but the actual animal payments exceed that
sum by several million dpllars. This arises
from the fact that nearly all the newly-admitted
army and navy cases have several years’ ac
crued pension due at the time of admission,
which is paid at the first payment.
During the year the first payments to new
pensioners amounted to $5,763,758, of which
$4,875,147 was paid to army and navy invalids,
widows, etc., and $7,388,611 to survivors and
widows of the war of 1812. The first payment
to pensioners of the war of 1812 will rapidly
fall off, while a material increase may be ex
pected in the army and navy cases for several
years, owing to the removal of the limitation
upon the commencement of pensions by tha
acts of Jan. 25 and March 8, 1879.
The above-named acts were passed after tha
estimates for the pensions for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1880, were submitted, and
were not, therefore, taken into account when
the appropriation was made, and there will be
a deficiency in the pension appropriation for
the current fiscal year as nearly as can now
be estimated as follows: $5,000,000 army pen
sions and $30,000 navy pensions, which should
be provided for, in order that the pensions for
the June quarter may be promptly paid.
There were on the 30th of June 136,645 unset
tled claims for arrears, an increase over last
year of 16,258. To them are to be added abont
40,000 old claims which were revived by the
Arrears act of Jan. 25, 1879, or called up from
the rejected files since that date, for further
consideration, and these, with the new claims
filed since the close of the year in excess of
the number settled, added to the number shown
by the record, will aggregate fully 200,000.
Since the passage of the Arrears act new in
valid, widows’, minor children, and dependent
relatives’ claims have been filed at an unprece
dented rate, the invalid claims being more
double the rate of the receipts at any previous
period except in 1866, and the widows’ class ex
ceeded any year since 1867, and twice as numer
ous as any year since 1871.
It is estimated that at the close of the year
there will be not less than 250,000 unsettled
cases before the office,
9 Seyebal young men were sitting to
gether, and a young lady happened to
approach the vicinity. One “real
sweet” young fellow seeing, as he sup
posed, the young lady looking at him,
remarked, playfully, and with a becom
ing simper, “ Well, Miss , you needn’t
look at me as though you wanted to eat
me.” “ Oh, no,” sweetly replied the
young lady, “1 never eat greens,”— Oil
