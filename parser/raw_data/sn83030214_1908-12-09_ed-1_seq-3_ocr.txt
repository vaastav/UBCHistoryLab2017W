Promulgated.

"^"ashingtcn. Dec. B.— As a result of reflations
promulgated by Secretary Straus of the Depart- !
ment of Commerce and L«.bor to-day.^ aeagoias
targes entering New York Harbor after February j
1 will be "bunched" Instead of strung: over a mil* j
cr bo at water, and the danger of collision in bad
cr foggy weather will. In the opinion of th* gov
eminent authorities, be greatly lessened. Unim- .
portant as th» matter may seem to the uninitiated.
this Is regarded by maritme Interests as of th«
most vital consequence. The, federal courts for
many years have been urging the necessity of
action by Congress in the premises, and hundreds I
of damage cases. Involving thousands of dollar*, I
have hinged upon the mere matter of the length :
of hawser employed to tow slow moving barges m
and out of the nareera Five years ago the bureau
of navigation attempted to secure an enactment
that would give It the power to regulate the length
of hawser and number or barges in a tow. but ,
failed. The last session of Congress anally passed
the required bill, and the power goes into the ,
hards of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor j
en the first day of the new- year. lii order to give
those affected by the- regulations an opportunity |
!to get acquainted with' the new order of thirgs. j
the Secretary allows them almost two months' ;
notice- After February 1 no hawser shall be more j
than 75 fathoms in length and the number of i
barges in a tow will be limited to three The. total
length of tow measured from the bow of the tug:
to the stem of the last barge will, therefore, not j
exceed 2,ort) feet. When they enter New York
Harbor the following regulation moat be obeyed
Tows navigating in the North and East rivers of
New York must be bunched above a line drawn
between the Statue of Liberty and the entrance
to Erie Basin. %Vhen tows are entering Long
Island Sound from the westward, the lines may be
lengthened out to the prescribed length after pass- .
ing Fort Bchnyier, and when bound for New Fort >
from Long Island Sound tows must b«> bunched j
before passing Whltestone Point.

Edward - -ase ih aJacueeea at length,
ii sa;. ■
There are two questions presented for our con
atderation. The first is whether the plaintiff's con- !
tract with the defendant as to the rate of oommis- j
eions which had b*»en t. existence for nearly five !
years, and having about fourteen years to run at i
the time Section y" of the insurance law was enact- >
cd. in 1906, is affected by said legislation to the ex- !
teat of changing its provisions a." to the amount
of plaintiff's commissions and materially reducing
them.
We are of opinion that Section 9T of the insurance ,
law should not be construed as retroactive, and.
therefore, it d<w not apply to the contract before
us.
The lower court held that when the plaintiff be- |
came the general agent of the defendant he be- ■
came "'vitally and essentially connected with Its
domestic affairs" and an- "important part of its ;
mechanism." but the Court of Appeals holds that j
••the plaintiff in executing hi* contract with the j
defendant became* its general agent, subject to J
the provisions thereof, nottiing more or less, and
no Inference Is to M '.flrawn that he became a
factor in the domestic 'affairs, mechanism, internal ,
organism or poll of the defendant."

VENEZUELA WARLIKE
To Fire on First Dutch Worship
Committing Unfriendly Act.
Caracas, Dec. 4 (via Hem a tad. Dec Si— The
departure of President Castro for Europe and
the naval demonstration by three Dutch war
ship?, may have serious consequences. The j?ov
emment Has resolved to fire on the first Ditch
warship which commits an unfriendly act. and
there ars signs of what may develop Into a
strong movement against President Castro.
As soon as news of the appearance of Dutch
warships was received in Caracas th« Minister
of War hurried down to La Guayra and took
command of the government forces there. This
was on Wednesday. The minister took with
him thirty cartloads of ammunition.
On Thursday Acting President Vicente Gomez
called a Cabinet meeting. The opinion of the
ministers was divided, but a resolution to fire
at the first unfriendly act was adopted. »
It was learned hers to-day that President Cas
tro recently closed negotiations for th« purchase
in Germany of three gunboats.
Leaflets ax-=> being distributed wvery day in
Caracas attacking President Castro and urging
President Gomez to seize the government Ef
forts are being made to discover the authors of
these attacks, and wherever they are found they
ar« promptly carried off to Jail.
It la reported he.r« that three revolutionary
generals have invaded the Apijre district in Co
lombia. Thpsfi leaders are Fernandez. Gabaidnn
and Peres. They are mer of minor importance,
and the movement which they hay» starte-1 has
caused no alarm in Caracas.

continue, cruising along the Venezuelan coast.
Th" Friesland is now anchored in Mararaibo
Bay. in sight of th« fortress of San Carlos. This

( ASTRO XOT IN PORT.
A Gathering of Venezuelan Consuls
at Santander.
Baotander. Dec. S. — The ateauner Guadeloupe.
on which President Caatro is a passenger, was
not sighted to-night. Many representatives of
the Venezuelan government and foreign corre
spondents axe here awaiting the arrival <•' the
President, who is expected to leave the steamer
her**, instead of going to Bordeaux.
The Spanish government has not been officially
advised from Caracas that the President will
visit Spain, and. under the impression that he
will only touch here on his way to Bordeaux,
has instructed the local authorities to render
him military and civil port honors. The four
Venezuelan consuls now in Santander, under in
struction from Nicolas Veloz-Goiticoa, Charge
d* Affaires at Berlin, are likewise in the dark as
to Castro's plans. Acting President Gomes has
communicated to the Venezuelan representatives
abroad little beyond the fact that President
Castro was a passenger on the Guadeloupe.
Late advices received to-night, however, con
firm the statement that Castro is bound for
Berlin. If it was his Intention to go to Bor
deaux. it is now believed that he will change his
plans when he learns from the consuls that
Prance is arranging to exact an apology from
him before he can land. It is probable, there
fore, that Castro will disembark here in order
to avoid an unpleasant conflict with the French
authorities.

tables with the seven or eight glasses for each
diner for more than onf> plate at a time, and nobody
rared. for H was a wine dinner in every s»?ns« of
the term.
Lee J. Vance presided as toa^st master. The
speakers and the toaata to whirh they responded
were as follows:
"The Political Vintage." Patrick F. McGowan.
president of the Board of Alderman: "Th« Truth
About Wine," Dr. Eugene H. Portei "American
■• ■••■ - and American Wines." Hon. E. M. Tier
ney; "Story of the Vine.*" Edward K. Emerson;
"Theory Versus Practice," Professor W. B. Al
wood.
President Patrick F. McGowan of t)i*> Board of
Aldermen, speaking on "The Political Vintage."
said that the vintage chosen by the people this
year was not the one he had favored.
"The man elected for" President." he said, "has
been chosen by the vote of the American people.
In him they and I, as good Americans, place our
trust and honor. I do not believe that any man
elected to the office of President, whether I vote
for him or against him. will do anything but what
is dicta- . by his own conscience. He may err In
his Judgment, but he does i bat I a thinks is right.
•When elected he will have my support and the
support of every right-minded American citizen.
"I want no man living abroad to come back to
New York City and tell us what we shall do. We
are masters of our own destiny, and we will brook
no dictation from any one who Is not living with us.
"The great trouble with the people of our coun
try to-day 13 their lack of respect for authority.
Let us teach It in our public schools. Let us teach
It from the pulpit — that those who are elected by
us as our representatives in authority should be
resp«cte«i and looked up to. and not. as soon as
they tike office, be malic Tied and vilified."
When Dr. Porter announced that he was on the
"water -wagon"' there •was a groan from the dinars,
but thi» was followed by an approving cheer when
he paid a tribute to the purity of American wine.
Dr. Porter said that the people of the United States
must be educated up to the worth of their home
products. He said that there should be a cam
paign of education to show that the purest of
winos art- made right In this country.
The association, at its annual meeting at the
Astor Hoii!«e earlier in the day. discussed thq fea
sibility of separating th* wine industry from tlie
saloon business. About S» per cent of the wine
grower of the United States are members of the
association or are supporting- it. Members from all
parts of th«* country attended the Treating. Ive
3 Vance, editor of "Th*» Wine Press." advocated
this movement by the a--=eciatiorv He Faii that a
careful estimate shows that the sis thousand sa
loons in Xew York City do not consume the an
nual output of r, na !arg-= California winery. The
separation of tin wine dealers from th« saloon
keepers as organizations, said Mr. Vance, would
work much good to the former, as well as to the
public. He advocated the granting of a wine
license separate from th» 'regular saloon license, to
enable restaurants to serve wine without help?
compelled to pay an almost prohibitive tax.
Notwithstanding the prohibition wave thaf has
•wept over The South and sections of the West, Ed
ward X- K. Emerson, president of the Wine Grow
er?' Association, was optimistic over the situation.
and expressed the opinion that on sober second
though' the American people would assort them
selves, and that sooner or later the anti-saloon
league movement would dwindle away Into a rec
ognition of me value of -win" as «» food and •■». bev
erage.
A resolution warn adopt declaring i T *r be "abso
■;••'.- necessary for the growth and progress of
the American, grape and wine arrowinc industries
that the present tariff schedule and duty <->r> !mpor-
ed ■wines be maintained "
Th« attention of Congress was called to the ' in
justice done both our -wine producers and our con
sumers in reciprocity treaties, whereby the duties
are towered on foreign still wires without regard
to their alcoholic strength, and on foreign cham
pagnes of $2 per case, which has limn a present

Importers and Manufacturers of
STRICTLY RELIABLE FURS
Call especial attention to the fact that all garments and arti
cles of our manufacture are replete with that quality called
"Style." so easy to recognize, so difficult to describe.
Without •"Styk" the most costly garment affords but
little pleasure to the wearer. With it. a comparatively inex
pensive one is a source of constant satisfaction, for it is the
quality of "Style" which gives grace and distinction.
We invite your inspection of the many beautiful and ex
clusive designs of our own production, and the newest rash
ions in European novelties.
As the Holiday season is rapidly approaching, buyers of
Christmas gifts will . .id in our large and varied stock a wide
field for the selection of a Christmas present.
FURS ARE ALWAYS ACCEPTABLE and they
combine beauty, utility and fashion in a greater degree than
any other Christmas remembrance.
As a suggestion we call attention to our beaur.r-- DM •
scarfs, stoics. fancy neck-pieces and muffs made up in all de
sirable furs from the costliest to those very mode'
priced.
FUR GARMENTS of quality and style for every occa
sion may be found in our show rooms in great variety.

coats and wraps. This line for both men and women is com

I vetoed a bill passtd at the last session which
would have modified restrictions upon expenditures,
because it was no: a conservative measure such as

would have opened the door to extravagance and
facilitated a return to old conditions. I hare but
one desire in this matter, and that is to conserve

which there is none more important, and adequate
