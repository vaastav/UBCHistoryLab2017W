and pairs. The negroes have taken to
counterfeiting. Jeff. Davit' negro was
caught on the night of the 18th stealing
blank sheets of notes from the Treasury
i Department, to which he had access to
.clean np the President's office. It turned
oat that he acted to concert with other
negroes. He will probably be hnng. The
writer says he has heard of a young Kioh-
tnona belie, about to be married, who paid
$85 for one bonnet, $50 for a second, and
$45 for a third. He is indignant at her
extravagance. Fifteen thousand dollars
hare been subscribed by the citizens of
Richmond and others for the army. AH
the prominent people paid readily, except
Mr. Memminger of South Carolina, who
denounced the moTement as a reflection
on the Government" Jeff Davis, while
handing in $50, remarked facetiously that
he had two pairs of boots, one of which he
would give, if necessary, and the other
pair also ; but for the fact.that he had be
come so nnaeoustomed to going barefoot,
that he was afraid to attempt it in cold
weather.
Atlantic and Great Western Railroad.
The Warren Chronicle speaks Tery en
couragingly and flatteringly of the pro
gress of this road. It says that but little
more than three months hare passed since
the location of the road in that part of the
county, was made. Now the grading is
finished (or Tery nearly) through the coun
ty. The bridge across the Mahoning at
Warren, is up, and the track will be laid
overit this week. The bridge over the
Mahoning at Braceville is also nearly com
pleted; also that orer Duck Creek, at
Learittsburg. The iron is laid from Ka
ren na to Braceville, also from the Mahon
ing Bridge in Braceville, nearly or quite
to the bridge at Warren.
The Chronicle adds :
("Teams are hauling iron from this place
cast, and one or two additional gangs of
track layers will be immediately put at
work, (if they have not already.) A
large, powerful engine is on the track,
west of the river, which will soon be able
to cross the bridge and render valuable
assistance to the track layers on this side.
There is scarcely a doubt but that before
this month expires, the track will be com
pleted from Salamanca, N. T. ,the point of
junction with the N. T. & Erie, R. R., and
Akron, and Warren will be less than 24
hours travel from New York."
Brownlow upon Buell.
Parson Brownlow, in a letter to the Phil
adelphia Press, says that all that has tared
Tennessee is Andrew Johnson, and not
BoelL On this point the parson uses the
following language : " General Buell want
ad to anr lender Nashville three months
go, and but for Gorernor Johnson, would
hare done it. No man here can hear all
the facts without arriring at the con
clusion that General Buell feared his own
personal safety, and kept his whole army
bout him, as a body guard, to defend him.
In other words he was so fearful of being
whipped, that he would not engage in a
battle at all. Another bad sign is that
General Buell is the most popular man
with the rebels that is in the United States
army. They regard him as favoring a
Southern Confederacy, and wishing to
make the Ohio rirer the line. . How that is
God only knows, but such is the opinion
entertained by Union men."
General Sam Houston.
The Houston Telegraph mentions the
passage through Brennan, Texas, of Gen
eral 8am Houston, on his way to Inde
pen deace, to g et out of the way of the "Yan
kee inraders." He made a speech, advis
ing that no more Texan troops be sent out
of the State, but be kept for home defense.
He denounced Hon. A. J. Houston, the
Federal Military Gorernor, as a drunken
rascal. He said he had been driren from
his house and home, and had come back to
Washington county, the cradle of Texan
liberty, where he expected to lay his bones.
General Grant's recent order, requiring
that all traders in Memphis should take
the oath, has caused much excitement
there. Nothing can be bought or sold
unless the dealer has taken the oath of allegiance.
Incidents of a Printer's Life.
The New Haren Journal has the follow
ing, which is a life picture of thousands of
the craft:
"The typo who "sets up" this article has a
history which is a fair sample of many of
the trade. Born in York State, brought to
New Haren in infancy, he went to Ohio

went into a printing office, left in a year,
went out on a farm for a while, then left
home and went to Detroit, stayed lire
years, finished learning his trade, then
went to Nashville, Tenn, worked in an
office three months, quit and went on the
railroad as a fireman, stayed one year, and
returned home after eight years' absence.
Then westward to St. Paul, Minn: Soon

when the war broke out. Enlisted in the
First Minnesota Regiment, was in the
battle of Bull Run, also at Ball's Bluffs,
where Lander was wounded. Went to

Lorain's Choice for Senator.

the choice of the people of Lorain and Me

they should hare been at the Grafton Con

[Correspondence of the Cleveland Leader.]
Natiokai Horn, Wahhihoto-', D."C.,
November 30, 182. f
Well, here we are at the Capitol, with a
clear blue sky and a warm red sun above
us, which is ia fine contrast with the
clouds of snow which filled the air In
Cleveland as we took our departure last
Friday morning. Every one instinctively
says as he looks out' npon such a day as
this, " What a glorious day for the great
armies before Fredericksburg." By-the-bye,
you may rely npon another fact, that
the people will not watch in rain for ac
tive operations on 'the Potomac, as they
did through that pleasant weather a year
ago. !
The city is full of strangers, and evi
dently -of all classes, colors, and condi
tions. The .hotels and boarding houses
are crowded. Boarding is high. Provi
sions are high. Fuel is high. !
Our member, Mr. Riddle, arrived last
evening, and stop at the Rational. Sen
ator Wade arrived this morning, and is
also stopping at the National. Mr. Wade
is looking very well, and if Ohio knows
what is for her interest and that of the
nation, she will re-elect him this winter.
I tell you we want lion-hearted men as
well in the councils ol the nation as npon
the battle-field, and the approaching ses
sion of Congress will conrince the people
of that fact if they don't already know it
Judge Worcester, of Norwalk, Mr. Edger
ton, of Akron, Mr. Hutchins, of Warren,
and in fact most of the Ohio delegation,
hare arrived.
The Avenue and Capitol Grounds hare
been alire with people all day luxuriating
in this "glorious old sunshine." The
dome to the Capitol is nearly completed,
improving its appearance very much. It
has not yet been perforated with a shell
by any of Jeff. Daris' horde of conspira
tors, although to them the most coveted
target in the world. The acres of white
tents to be seen on the surrounding hills,
and the vast armies between it and Jeff's
minions, will probably present an obstacle
never to be overcome by them. No; they
will never get within gun-shot of the Cap
ital. ,
Emancipation is triumphant ! The ball
rolls on, and it will continue to roll on I
No General can stop it no false Demo
cratic party can stop it. I rerily beliere
it to be beyond the power of man to stop
it. ' - They may check it, ; they may turn , it
aside for a moment, but it cannot be stop
ped. The Lord has decreed that Slavery
shall be destroyed in our fair land, and
who is mightier than fie. The " pure cus
sedness ' which has been instilled into the
hearts of slaveholders by that corrupting
institution, will drive them to such deeds
of deprarity and wickedness that the
whole cirilixed world will stand aghast
shuddering with horror I The black flag
will be raised orer battle-fields by them,
and no prisoners taken no wounded
spared no mercy shown I By it they will
lose what cotton sympathy they now hare
in foreign lands the Vallandigham De
mocracy would say take all the Slare
States and go, and peace be with jou,
rather than do that, but they can't go in
that way yet such a retaliation will be
meted out to them by our own soldiery as
will demonstrate to them that destruction
to rebels will follow the black Sag. That
miserable rebel, Jeff. Daris, as initiatory
to the black flag, has just ordered one ef
his generals to shoot the first ten Federal
officers who fall into his hands as prison
ers. The time will soon come when eren
the present apologists of Slavery in the
North will join in the work of Emancipa
tion. Foreign intervention is not now feared
in the least. The recent attempt of Louis
Napoleon having so signally failed, it is
now thought that matters will be left to
work out their legitimate results without
further effort of to mix in

Mi. j
December 1, lSoi
I saw Congress commence its session to
day. The usual hum was increased by the
cordial salutations of members until the
clock indicated that it was twelve, when
the rap of the garel of Speaker Grow was
followed by an almost deathly stillness.
The old Chaplain, with his locks of snow
addressed .the Throne . of Grace, and as
soon as he had said " Amen," dozen mem
bers shouted from different parts of the
Halt, "Mr. Speakerl" " Mr. Speaker 1" and
the usual uproar prevailed.
A communication from the Senate Bays
they are organised, and hare appointed a
committee to inform the President of that
fact, whereupon the House does the same.
In the meantime, little Cox of Columbus
introduces a secesh bomb by way tf a reso
lution censuring the President for arrest
ing secesh sympathisers, and putting them
in Forts and Prisons where their preach
ings had no effect. Mr. Colfax promptly
mores to lay them on the table, which is
very promptly done by the yeas and nays.
Old Ricaardsoa, of Illinois, follows op this
bluff game by introducing a similar reso
lution, only limiting it to Illinois butter
nuts. It was summarily disposed of in
the same manner.
The President's Message is sent in, and
the Clerk commences reading. I was in
the Senate, as Mr. Forney, who by the
way is an excellent reader, concluded the
message. The galleries were literally
jammed full, intently listening, and as the
concluding sentence was uttered, a uni
versal applause came forth, growing louder
and louder until repeated raps of the gavel
and sharp cries of order from the Chair
man put a stop to it.
I met Captain Sterling of our glorions
Seventh, . lie is now serving on General
Hooker's staff, and came from the army
before Fredericksburg on Saturday. From
him I learn that the 7th and CGth are to be

Colonel of the 6Gth taking the command. I
can hardly believe such injustice to Colo

has won his eagles by hard and honorable
service, it is he.

Banker outgenerals Bank.
An amusing adventure is related as hav
ing happened to the Bank of England,
which had committed the great disrespect
of refusing to discount a bill of a large
amount, drawn by Anslem Rothschild, of
Frankfort, on Nathan Rothschild, of Lon
don. The bank had haughtily Teplied,
" that they discounted only their own bills,
and not. those of private persons." But
they had to do with one stronger than the
Bank. " Private persons I" exclaimed
Nathan Rothschild, when they reported to
him the fact. " Private persons I I will
make these gentlemen see what sort of pri
vate persons we are I" Three weeks after
wards Nathan Rothschild who had em
ployed the interval in gathering all the 5
notes he could procure in England and on
the Continent presenting himself at the
Bank at the opening of the office. He drew
from his pocket-book a 5 note, and they
naturally counted out 6 sovereigns, at the
same time looking quite astonished that
the Baron Rothschild should have person
ally troubled himself for such a trifle.
The Baron examined one by one the coins,
and then put them into a little canvas bag ;
then drawing out another note, a third, a
tenth, a hundredth, he never put the
pieces of gold into the bag without exam
ining them, and in some instances trying
them in the ballance, as he said, " the law
gives him the right to do." The first pocket-book
being emptied, and the first bag
full, he passed them to his clerk, and re
ceived a second, and so continued till the
close of the Bank. The Baron had em
ployed seven hours to change 21,000.
But as he had also nine employees of his
house engaged in the same manner, it re
sulted that the house of Rothschild had
drawn 210,000 in gold from the Bank, and
that he had so occupied the tellers that no
other person could change a single note.
Every thing that bears the stamp of eccen
tricity has always pleased the English.
They were, therefore, the first day, very
much amused at the little pique of Baron
Rothschild. They howerer laughed less
when they saw him return the next day at
the opening of the Bank, flanked by his
nine clerks, and followed this time by
many drays, destined to carry away the
specie. They laughed no longer when the
king of bankers said with iron simplicity,
" These gentlemen refuse to pay my bills,
I have sworn not to keep theirs." " At
their leisure, only I notify them that I
haTe enough to employ them tor two
months 1" "For two months I" "Eleven
millions in gold drawn from the Bank of
England which they have never possess
ed! " The Bank took alarm. The next
morning notice appeared in the journals
that henceforth the Bank would pay
Rothschild's bills the same as their own.
Touching Farewell Address.
Here is a rare bit of satire from Orpheus
C. Kerr in the Sunday Mercury:
But the whole body of Mackerels, sane
and insane alike,unite in a feeling of strong
anguish blended with enthusiasm, at the
removal of the beloved General of the
Mackerel Brigade. He has been so much
a father to them all, that they never ex
pected to get a step farther while he was
with them.
There's a piece of domestio philosophy
for you, my boy.
When the General heard of his removal,
my boy, he said that it was like divorcing
a husband from a wife who hnd always
supported him, and immediately let fly
the following farewell address:
Hiasquastiu or Abut or Accomac, 1
Foot or tuf Blub Ripoe. t
Mr CniLDSiit: An order from the Hon
est Abe divorces us, and gives the com
mand of all these attached beings to Major
General Wobert Wobinson. Heartrend
ing and enthuasastic cheers.
In parting with you I cannot express
how much I love your dear bosoms. As
an army, you have grown from youth to
old age under my care. In you I never
found doubt or coldness, nor anything else.
The victories yon have won nnder my
command will live in the nation's work of
fiction. The strategy we have achieved,
the graves of many unripe Mackerels, the
broken forms of those disabled by the
emancipation proclamation the strongest
associations that can exist among men
still make it advisable that yon should
rote for me as President of the United
stats in 1865. Thus we shall erer be com
rades in supporting the Constitution, and
making the Constitution support us.
The General of the M ackeecl Beioade.

American Hopefulness.
One of the American characteristics,
which most surpresed Mr. Trollope, in
his recent journey throngh this country,
is the imperturbable good humor and hope
fulness of the people. He frequently meets
persons who are ruined by the calamities
of the war. They never weep, or wring
their hands, or tear their hair. One man,
from whom the secessionists of Missouri
had taken cattle and crops, and all the
fruit of the labor of years, merely remark
ed in a quiet way, while he picked his
teeth with a bowie knife, " Yes, they have
been kinder rough with me." That was
all he had nothing else to say. Trollope
thinks that a genuine American never
complains and never despairs. " What
ever happens in the external world," says
Mr. T, "the man is always there."
The Nightcap Brigade.
[Nashville Correspondence Cincinnati Com.]
The Nightcap Brigade was organized,
and created great sensation in Nashville,
day before yesterday. General Rosecrans,
aggravated by .stragglers, who destroy dis
cipline, prepetrate outrages upon private
property and npon persons, and who are
cowards, decorated about fifty of them with
grotesque night-caps, made of white mus
lin, frilled and ornamented with red trim
ming, and caused them to be marched
through Nashrille under strong guard,
to the tune of the ' Rogue's March,", and
then shipped them to Camp Wallace thus
shamefully distinguished, directing that
they should march through Louisville and
to camp in disgraceful guise. All who
disgrace themselves and the service by
straggling and cowardice will hereafter be
ignominiously punished. The scene was
grotesque and humiliating, but this severe
punishment will have a beneficial effect on
the army.
An editorial friend of ours was putting
his little daughter through Prof. Royce's
gymnastic exercises. ' Holding her up
from the floor, suspended tij her hand
from a ring, she suddenly "let go to
laugV'as she said, and fell to the fioor.
That reminds ns of the Irishman to whose
heels another was hanging, who request
