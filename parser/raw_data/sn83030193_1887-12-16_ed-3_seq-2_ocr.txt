I THE POOIET HHBVB.
Orator Ltmou told a greater truth than he
intended when he said to the assembled
Bepnblieani last night: "The President'
Message tonohea your pooketa."
Indeed it does, and the pooketa of all other
taxpayers.
The President purposes to leave in the
pooketa of tho men who earned it the 9100,.
000,000 a year now extorted from them by nn
neoeasary taxes.
There if a prinolplo involved in this policy,
tmt the pocket nerve is a very sensitive one
toATnericaa taxpayers, as the war-tarifl de
fenders will discover.

clubs the first knock-down was won by Bhib-
sj" The result must havo been surprising to
ft. those who fanoled that Mr. BLAirrn's recent
W "message had solidified and remagnetlxed
the party in his favor.
, The substantial reasons why the Bepub-
licana would not, as a matter of good policy,
2 nominate Mr. Bianni for President maybe
j set aside by the tariff issue. But tho vote of

FEKHY POSTAGE,
Within a short time it will be possible to
reduce letter postage to one cent an ounce
without involving a serious loss to the Gov
ernment. To mako the change now would probably
create a deficiency of some $10,000,000 a year.
Tho champions of a perpetual war tariff see
in this another opportunity to spond tho
surplus, and therefore some of them favor a
reduction in postage at once.
If the Government will take from the tax
payers no more monoythan?t needs.tthoy can
pay the present rates of- postage without
trouble until such timo as a cheaper rato can
be afforded.
PAIHLEB8 EXECUTIONS,
Tho Commission appointed br the Legisla
ture to report on the " most humane method
of capital punishment" is understood to bo
in favor of some electrical mode of executing
death sentences.
The murdorers thomsolves aro not given to
selecting tho "most humane method" of
despatching their victims j but society owes
something to itself. And hanging is cor
tainly a coarse and brutal method of execut
ing a criminal.
It would undoubtedly be less shocking to
kill by a shook than by hanging.
Mr. LiKon says that in Mississippi " when
the Democratic convention adjourns tho
eloctlon is over." It is just so in Pennsyl
vania and Vermont and Iowa when tho
Republican conventions adjourn. Tho clco.

meetings.
Tho Republican Club absentees from tho

Tho colorod orator from tho South failed
to montlon anything that tho Republican
party has done for bis raco within the last
dozen years to call for the fealty of tho

The Democrats in Congress may as well
give up tho idoa of trying to overoomo tho
majority of 80,000 in monopoly-riddon Penn

WasnixaTOjt, Do. is. nothing of an exdtlng

holidays. After Congress reassembles In January
the fashionable world will begin to look np. Then
It will be that tbe statesmen of tbe country will
start In wltb their pet messuroa to distract tbe
financial and political Interests. At this time It
Is next to Impossible to predict what Congress Is
dlsroscd to do or will do wild tbe tariff. The
nnanlmons sentiment In and ontof tjongrcss Is that
the necessity for action was never more apparent
and that never was the fear of delay more wide
spread. Ilcpubllcana and Democrats, Protection
ists and Free-Traders, tariff reformers, one and
all unhesitatingly admit the urgency that the occa

volves ujon Congress. Uui how Is tbe problem to

error or false step will prove disastrous to the
party thst makes lu It Is not aurprls ng, there

right shy of tbe subject until they are forced, out
of necmsity, to face tbe music. It Is no secret
that tho most prominent orators ot both parties In
both branches of Congress are preparing tpe.otir s
on tho tariff and ate for formulailng policies lor

publicans, particularly, propose to pay their re

of his messsge.
The Democrats sre In One fettlo for the encoun
ter. As between Speaker Carlisle and Samuel J.
Itandall there dots not seem to be that friction
which was so destructive to all efforts to psss a tariff
bill In the lsst and procedlng Congrcuos. Thcso
two able men have at last, so It appears, reached
some understanding, the result of which, It ta
hoped, will redound to the best Interests of the
country and their party. This understanding
could only be obtained by mutual concessions.

STAGE KISSING.
"Snob kisses, " said tbo little actress scornfully,
shaking her golden cnrla and arranging ber rosy
lips Into a delightful pout, "are not worth having.
In faot, they aro nothing moro nor leu than a hid
eous parody on the genuine article."
Now, to anybody who did not know the subjeot
of our conversation, such a remark as that Just
uiado, would have been startling. I should really
bo seriously embarrassed If I were not permitted
to explain matters, becauao, as I was the only per
son present at tho time my little sunny-haired
friend gave vent to this sentiment, yoa will readily
seo that I might subjeot myself to unworthy
suspicions.
Tho f set Is that we were merely discussing the
stago kiss, In which susceptible theatre-goers aro
deeply Intereatud, audi was endeavoring to extraot
a little Information about it from the dainty little
lady who waa only too willing to give It,
"Tho audience Imagines," she said, "when
they see a handsomely dreased young man, good
looking, well mustacned and altogether stylish I
bate tbat word, don't you I fervently embrace tbe
loading lady ot tho company that the kiss, even
though It may not bo given with genuine feeling,
must, nevertbeless, bo agreeable. Oh, my dear
boy, do, If you can, contradict this for my sake.
Never was thero so fatal an error or a supposition
bo Btupldly unwsrrauted by tbe real facta of the
caso."
Sno waa evidently doeply In earnest, and earnest
people are always entitled to profound attention,
so I became profoundly attentive.
" I must make a confession," she said, In more
subdued toues, " and tell you everything. The
first time I knew I had to be kissed on the stage by
the good-looklnz leading man abl you would be
surprised if I told you bis name I admit that I was
dellgb.ed. Yes, I waa by no means averse to It.
I knew tbat the rolo called for tho kiss and I was
aatlslled. Shall I ever forget that kiss I I think
not. I found a face bealde my own, so besmeared
wltb rouge, so lncruatod with powder, so moist
with cosmetic, that I assure you It didn't look like
a face. Aa I said, this wjs really my first stage
kiss. I don't say It was my first kiss, mark you
well, because well, I have three brothers, list
aal"
Sbo laughed proToklngly, and I felt vexed with
out know lug why.
"Ills awful face," sho went on, "was pressed
closo to mine, and It positively sickened me. The
leading man waa Trench, and he bad dlnod elabor
ately on food exceedingly flavored with garlic I
remember I had to spring back after tbe embrace
and exclaim, 'How daro yon Insult me with your
kisses. Olve them to ber who will appreclat
them.'
"I made that speech from my heart. I thor
oughly meant what I said, and the effect upon the
audience waa excellent- Only, for the life of me, I
couldn't think ot any one who would appreciate suoh
kisses. I wouldn't have offered them to my bit
terest foe. "
She laughed at the recollection and then went
on: "Stag kisses are generally disgusting, ot
course, sometimes there are merely inake-bclleve
kisses, but when you ate right In front of the audi
ence that Is Impossible. Tbe audience may some
times be shocked at the apparent warmth of a stage
kiss, but they would be more shocked if It were not
given. A man who is so enveloped In paint Isn't a
a man. You are merely kiulnr a painted doll,
with a mustache so colored by cosmetics that you
are In mortal agonr lest It lesve some trace on your
lliy.wblte skin. Oh, yes!" sho added, smiling,
'many are the property' mustaches I bare
loaibed lor that rea.oo."
'lben she uttered tbe remark which embarraaased
me at tbo beginning.
Do you know, " she said, beaming sersphlcally,
" that at one time I was so utterly tick of stage
kltslng, and It became so revolting to me, tnat I
really thought yt-s, I did. honor bright I thst I
should never again b able to tolerate kissing off
thtstsgs." AlviM Dali.

MISERY IN LIFE AND DEATU.
A FOOS MOTflEE'B TIOLti BT TBI BIDH OP
HER DEAD BADH.
0ek1c Tbr Day In Vain For Means ta
Bury th Child Potter's FUld tho Only
Kesonrce Finally Her Uusband On st
Hpree Hlnce the Infant Died A Tale of
Foverty From an East Broadway Garret.
i
In a wretched room in the tenement 21
East Broadway, tbo bare walls and floor and
scanty furnishings of which bespeak tho pov
erty of the tenants, lived a fow days ago
James Driver, a drunken printer, his wife
and their child, sevon weeks old.
To-day the father is gone, no one knows
where, tho child lies in the Morgue waiting
burial in Potter's Field, and th mother sits
huddled in her scanty garments trying to keep
warm.
The couple were married ten years ago,
when neither was more than seventeen.
Thoy had five children, two of whom are
dead, while tho others ore in St. John's
Home in Brooklyn. Their married life has
been unfortunate. Six months ago Mrs.
Driver left her husband, who failed to sup
ply her even with tncnnecossaries of lifo, and
went to her sister-in-law's in Brooklyn.
Last Saturday Driver sobered up suffi
ciently to repent, secured the room in the
East Broadway tenement, and Sunday
moved in with his wife and babe.
The infant as a delicate littlo thing, and
lack of nourishment and caro did not help it.
Tho child grew weaker hourly. Thero vtas
no attempt made at first to secure medical
treatment. Indeed, if tho mother found
means to buy a meal she was t fortunate, and
the poor babe suffered accordingly.
Last Monday a neighbor called, and be
twoen them they decided to seek aid for the
child. The only physician they know was
an Indian Doctor on East Broadway. Ho
saw tho child, said ho could not live, gavo
him medicine to caso pnin, took a dollar for
his services and was gono.
That afternoon tho babe died. The same
day tbe fathor started on a spree. On Tues
day he turned lip at home, and found the
littlo one's lifeless form on tho cot and tho
mother sobbing beside it.
But thepicturo evidently did not impress
him greatly. He said he would go out and
borrow monoy to buy a cofiln. He wont and
the wife has seen nothing of him since. An
undertaker met him twico, both times
drunk and still looking for the necessary
inonov.
Tuesday night. Wodnesday and Thursday
Bussed with no caller savo the undertaker,
e wanted pay, cash down, for hiB cofiln, ho
said, or ho would not furnish it. On Thurs
day morning at 0 the mothor started out to
borrow the $i sho needed to satisfy him.
Half an hour later tho undertaker called
with a simple littlo coffin, with nickel trim
mings under his arm. For three hours he
waited, and then without a word tucked tho
box under his arm and went away.
At 3 o'clock Mrs. Driver returned. She
had been able neither to beg nor borrow the
money. She was wet, worn out and misera
ble after the dismal tramp.
Then again neighbors came to her relief.
They went to tho Madison street police sta
tion, tho Elizabeth street polico station and
to the office of tho Commissioners of Chari
ties and Correction, Third avenue and Elev
enth street, where sho finally found assist
ance. Late in the afternoon yesterday the Public
Undertaker drove to the house, dropped the
body into a plain pine box, nailed down the
cover and drove to the Morguo.
Driver has not yet returned.
HELD WHILE JUS THROAT WAS ODT.
Tho Peacemaker tn a Flgbt Between Aque
duct laborer Shockingly Voundd.
Some Aqueduct laborers had a fight last
night, in consequence of which one man now
lies in tho Manhattan Hospital inn critical
condition.
Thomas Eennody, aged twenty-four, is a
laborer in shaft No. 28, and is also tho keeper
of a boarding-house at One Hundrod and
Sixty-third street and Tenth avenuo. Pat
rick Corcoran, aged twentsr, is a boarder.
Last night Corcoran anff another man had
a dispute about some money and soon came
to blows. Kennedy, not wishing any fighting
on his premises, stepped in betwoen the two
combatants and endeavored to quell the dis
turbance. As he did so Corcoran, with an oath, pulled
out a razor and, seizing Kennedy by the hair,
drew tho weapon around his neck. Kennedy
fell, while blood spurted from the wound.
Corcoran endeavored to escape, but the
spectators, enragod by his action, set upon
him and beat him unmercifully. When he
did manage to break away both eyes wero al
most completely closed and blooa was flow
ing from many cuts on his face and skull.
In this condition the man climbed over the
rear fence and ran down tho street. He was
stopped by Pollooman Groo, of the One Hun
dred and Fifty-sooondtreet squad, and led
back to tho sceno of the fight.
Kennedy was lying on the ground uncon
scious. Tho spectators had fled. Tho officer
summoned an ambulance andhad the land
lord removed to the Manhattan Hospital,
where his wound was pronounced serious.
Corcoran's head was dreesed by the ambu
lance surgeon and thon he was locked up.
Detectivo Thayer hunted up two witnesses,
John Cunningham-agod twenty, a boarder
with Kennedy, and Felix McKcndry, of One
Hundred and Seventy-ninth street and Tenth
avenue.
The party, with tho exception of Kennedy,
were arraigned in tho Harlem Police Court
this morning. The two witnesses were sent
to the Houso of Detention and Corcoran was
held to await tho result of Kennedy's injuries.

HONORDia THE DtAD PRIEST,
Many Ppl looking Upoi Father Rlordan

A stranger pasting 8t. Blmard's Churoh,
In West Fourteenth street, and teeing th
line of men and women tlkt files stoadlly
through the doors would botempted to ask i
" What servico is going on tollay ?"
Any ono who know what dlew them there,
might answer : " It is tho service of the poor
and humble to ono whose lifewas spent in
befriending the unfriended." 1
The magnet that draws tliil concourso is
the dead form of Father John'Riordau, the
priest of Castle Garden, tho fathtr to thous
ands of ignorant young Iritf, girls who
landod at tho Battery and fovnd none to
Sreet or care for them savo tholjurly, ton-cr-heartcd
friend who was waiting to shield
their simple, innocent souls from the wiles
which awaited them. His roof afforded them
homelike hospitality until they ciuld find
their friends or start on their jonrtoy to tho
West, and his cheery voice followed them in
tones of benediction and encouragerlent.
No wonder that the women looked linger
ingly on tho still face, so changed frm tho
rouoate huo of jocund health which tie good
Driest wore in life, although a quiet, sinllu
still plays about the cold lips so uVul to
sinillug on the suffering needy: What
wonder when tho last words tnat thoy
formed wero: "Toko caro of tho podrim.
migrant girls."
Men and women passed slowly on by, the
tall candles and wiped tho tears from tioir
eyes as they inndo their way fiom tho chuich.
Tho main altar is heavily draped in blik.
Tho body will bo transferred to a plain casjot
this evoning by Undertaker Loonard. 'to

All who tako part in tho function aro

it would havo been hard to have selected any

warm-hearted cheeriness endeared him to all.
At his own request thero will be no dis

Sin. Tonne for the Latter' Lat Under
Clothing Mother n.nd Dauihter Weeping
In Court Htorn Justice Patterson DIsJ
posed to be rjevero to the YonntT Woman,
Of tears there was a copious flood.
They coursed down tho cheeks of pretty
and petite Carrie Van Derkar and those ol
her equally pot! to and once pretty mother,'
mingling in glistening drops on the elegant
seal cloak of the girl and tho more plain cloth
jacket of the mother.
It was beforo the bar of the Jefferson Mar
ket Police Court where Miss Yon Derkar was
arraigned on the charge of larceny preferred
by Pawnbroker Weaver, of C0 Ninth avenue.
Tho crime charged was the redeeming from
pledge and conversion of $25 worth of under
clothing, tho property of Mrs. Alice J.Young,
of 211 West Fourteenth street.
Justico Jake Patterson big and massive,
looked down frowningly upon the dashily
attired little woman. The latter tried "to bo
defiant, but tho arrogant air was a thin veneer
for her womanly weakness.
Counsellors Joseph Btmer and Frank J.
Walsh supported her on eitber side, while
Denis A. Spollisoy represented the oom
plainant. " Your Honor," commenced Mr. Stiner, in '
porsuasivo tone, and he pleaded that tha
complainant bo allowed to withdraw the com
plaint, Mr. Spellisoy, on behalf of the pawn
broker, also pleaded for tho girl.
Lawyer Walsh suggested that thore seemed
to be a fair defonse, as Miss Van Derkar
strenuously denied that she token the under
clothing or represented herself as Dollie
Iitchell.
Tho big, bluff Justico paid no heed to this
suggestion, but Lawyer Btiner did, and turn
Ug quickly to Mr. Walsh said:
"For Heaven's sake don't press that.
Ttere's no dofenso at all. tiho was identified
out of a thousand."
I think this girl should bo taken care of.
He parents don't appear to bo able to look
of tct her, " said tho Justice. I am informed
that, she is away from homo for weeks at a
tlmd. Where's her mother ?"
,A little woman with trembling hand and
lips stepped up to the bar beside her daughter.
At sjent of her the girl's defiant air aisap.
peared7 and reaching out she fell upon her
mother, who caressingly pillowed the girl's
head upon her shoulder, and with the excla
mation. " My poor child t " mingled her
tears with those of her daughter.
Even tho stern Justico was affected by this
scene, but ho did not allow his feelings to in
terfere with his duty.
1 ' Isn't it true that this girl lias boen away
from home for weeks at a time f" asked he.
Tho trembling mother finally managed to
say that Carrio was home for a little while
overy two or three days.
"lam afraid she is a bad girl," continued
the Justice. " She tells Btones of living on
Fifth avenue and having coaches and molds,
and sho must got her money somewhere. Fm
afraid you can't take care of her. "
" I'll try to, sir," murmured the mother.
' ' How are you going to do it f " asked im
placable Justice.
" I'll send her to her grandparents in Mas
sachusetts." Hero the accused girl broke in and between
her tears and sobs said:
" When 1 was-as away-ay I was-oswith my
annt in Brook-ook-lyn, and mamma knew
where I was," concluded she hurriedly beforo
another sob choked her, find again sho pil
lowed her head on her mother's Dosom.
"The trouble with Carrie is that she la
Blck ami nervous and is not always in her
right mind," appealed tho mother.
Justice Patterson thought this plea the most
satisfactory yet advanced, and said that it
rather confirmed an idea he had formed.
He conferred with Elbridge T, Gerry, of
tho Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Children.
Finally it was agreed that restitution should
bo made to Mrs. Young, and pretty Carrio
was discharged with, "Take your child away,
madam."
Ihe father of the girL L. P. Van Derkar,
has an office in tho very building where his
daughter was imprisoned, but did not go
near her. "

Some modification In It,
Anthony Comstock was asked by a Would
reporter this morning what he intended to do
in the matter of the Bev. Justin Fulton'

on account of its obscenity.
" It is a matter which concerns the District
Attorney of Massachusetts. The book has

I suggested to Mr. Fulton, who conferred
