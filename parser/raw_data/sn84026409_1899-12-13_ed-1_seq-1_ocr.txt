LITTLE JOE BRYAX.
The older yardmen tell tbe storj even
yet bow young Michael Bryan, a
straight and manly a fellow as ever left
bis green old native land for tbe better
chances of tbe new world thin tide of
the sea, came whistling out of tbe
rouudbouae that morning and stepped
hastily from before an incoming loco
motive, neither seeing uor bearing an
other rushing up tbe parallel track.
His mates cried out to him too late!
Nobody who saw it would ever forget
tbe look of agony which distorted bis
handsome face in that horrible instaut,
when be recognized bis doom, or tbe
perpendicular leap into the air, from
which be felt back beneath tbe crunch
ing wheels.
In tbe excitement and consternation
of the' time, no messenger bad been
sent in advance to prepare the poor
young wife for her trouble, and she
stood in tbe doorway with ber baby
crowing in ber arms when tbe stout
bearers paused at ber gate with their
mangled burden. Sbe uttered a terri
ble cry and fell fainting tbe child's
teuder back striking tbe sbarp edge of
the doorstone.
"What a pity it was not killed out
right."' said everybody but tbe poor
mother.
She herself always insisted that only
ber coustant watching over tbe little,
flickering life kept ber from going mad
in the first dreadful montbd of ber be
reavement "Crooked Joe is a rum 'un," said one
of bis rough acquaintances, when Joe
had reached his twelfth year. "He
senses bis troubles well enough, but he
don't let on to nobody."
Mr. Crump, tbe telegraph operator,
was Joe's constant friend.. It was he
who at odd moments bad taught tbe
boy to read, and bad initiated him into
some of the mysteries of tbe clicking
instrument, which to Joe's imaginative
mind seemed some strange creature
with a hidden life of its own.
It was growing toward dark one No
vember afternoon. Joe never an un
welcome visitor sat curled up in a cor
ner of Mr. Crump's office, waiting for
bis mother to finish her work. He was
laboriously spelling out by tbe fading
light the words upon a page of an Illus
trated newspaper, quite oblivious of the
ticking, like that of a very jerky and
rheumatic clock, which sounded in tbe
room.
Mr. Crump, too, bad a paper before
him, but bis ears were alive.
Suddenly he sprang to his feet, re
peating aloud tbe message wbieh that
moment flashed along tbe wire.
. "Kngine No. 110 running wild. Clear
track."
He rushed to the door, shouting the
news.
"Not a second to pare! She'll be
down in seven minute!"
The word passed like lightning.
In a moment the yard was in wild
confusion. Men flew hither and thith
er, yard engines steamed wildly away,
the switches closing behind them.
The main track was barely cleared
when 110 came in sight, swaying from
side to side, her wheels threatening to
leave the track at each revolution.
Sbe parsed tbe depot like a meteor,
her bell clanging with every leap of the
piston, the steam escaping from her
whistle with tbe continuous shriek of a
demon, and the occupants of the cab
wrapped from view in a cloud of dense
smoke.
Some hundred rods beyond the depot
the track took a sharp upward grade,
from which it descended again to strike
tbe bridge across a narrow but deep and
rocky gorge.
Men looked after the flying locomo
tive, and then at each other with
blanched faces.
"They're gone! A miracle can't save
'em," said one, voicing tbe wordless
terror of the rest. "If they dou't fly
the track on the up grade, they'll go
down as soon as they strike the trestle,"
he added.
Tbe crowd began to run along the
track, some with a vain instinct of help
fulness, others moved by that morbid
curiosity which seeks to be "in at tbe
death."
Bub look! Midway the long rise tbe
speed of the runaway engiue suddenly
slackens.
"What does It mean? She never
could have died out in tbat time!'
shouted an old yardman.
Excitement winged their feet. When
tbe foremost runners reached the plce
tbe smoking engine stood still ia ber
track, quivering ia every steel-clad
nerve, ber great wheels still whizzing
round and round amid a flight of red
sparks fro.11 beneath. 5
"What did it ? What stopped her ?"
the crowd asked.
The engineer, staggering from the
eab with tbe pallid face of tbe fireman
behind him, pointed without speaking
to where a little pale-faced, crooked
backed bey bad sunk down, panting
with exertion, beside tbe track. At his
feet lay a huge oil-can, overturned and
empty.
Tbe crowd Btared, one at another,
open-mouthed. Then tbe truth flashed
upon them.
"He oiled the track V
"Bully for Crooked Joe!-'
"Three cheers for Joe! Huita! Hur
ra! Kurra!"
Tbey caught up the exhausted child,
flln;inf him from burly shoulder to
.boulder, striving with each other for
OTTlfBir
SOMERSET, PA.,
the honor of bearing him, and so, in ir
regular, tumultuous, triumphal proces
sion tbey brought him back to the de
pot and set hltn down among them.
"Pass the bat, pards!" cried one.
It bad been pay day and tbe saved
engineer and fireman each dropped lu
his month's wages. Not a hand in all
the throng tbat did not delve into a
pocket. There was the crisp rustle of
bills, and the chink of gold and silver
coin.
"Out with your handkerchief, Joe!
Your bands won't hold it all! Why,
young one what what's the matter
with you?"
For tba boy, with scarlet cheek and
burning eyes bad clenched both etna 1
hands behind bis back the poor, twist
ed back laden with its burden of pin
and deformity.
"No! no.r' he cried, In a shrill, high
voice. "Don't pay me! Can't you see
what It's worth to me, once jut once
in all mv life to be of a little use like
other folks!"
The superintendent had come from
bis office. He laid his band on tbe
boy's head.
"Joe," be said, "we couldn't pay you
if we wished. Money doesn't pay for
lives! But you have saved us a great
many dollars besides. Won't you let us
do something for you ?"
"You can't! You can't! Nobody
cau!" Tbe child's voice was almost a
shriek. It seemed to rend the air with
the pent-up agony of years. "There's
j only one thing in tbe world I want.
and nobody can give me that. Nobody
can ever make me anything but 'Crook
ed Joe r
The superintendent lifted him and
held him against bis own brea-L
"My boy," he said, in bis firm, gentle
tones, "you are right None of us can
do that for you. But you can do it for
yourself. Listen to me! Where is the
quick brain God gave you, and tbe
brave heart? Not in that bent back of
yours tbat has nothing to do with
them. Let us help you to a chance
only a chance to work and to learn
and it will rest with yourself to say
whether in twenty years from now, if
you are alive, you are 'Crooked Joe' or
Mr. Joseph Bryan!"
Visiting in C-
not long ago a
friend said to me:
"Court is in session. You must go
with me and bear Bryan."
The court-room was crowded, at our
entrance, with an expectant audience.
When the brilliant young attorney rose
to make bis plea I noticed, with a shock
of surprise, that bis noble head sur
mounted an undersized and misshapen
body.
He bad spoken but live minutes, bow
ever, when I had utterly forgotten the
physical defect; in ten minutes I was
eagerly interested, and thereafter, dur
ing tbe two hours' fpeech, beld spell
bound by tbe marvelous eloquence
which is fast raising him to tbe leader
ship of his profession in his native city.
"A wonderful man!" said my friend,
as we walked slowly homeward. Then
he told me the story of "Crooked Joe."
THE THOMAS POISOXIXQ CASE.
Sr. Schill Analyzes the Suspected
Baking Powder Used in Mixing
the Cakes and finds Alum.
Johnstown, IVna., Tribune.
Although tbe members of tbe Thomas
family, of Thomas' M ill, Somerset Co.,
who were reported to have been pois
oned by impure baking powder used in
rnixiog buckwheat cakes, are convales
cing, the case has not ceased to excite
attention.
Mr. Thomas said Saturday that the
original can with the remainder of tbe
powder left over after mixing the cakes
had been taken away by Dr. Critch
fleld, for analysis. The powder bad
been bought at a neighboring country
store, and was one of the low priced
brands. He paid, Mr. Thomas said,
twenty-five cents or less per pound
for it
Dr. Critch field said tbat tbe patients
bad the symptoms of alum poisoning.
As tbe same kind of baking powder is
sold in many oity groceries, as well as
country stores, Dr. Critch field thought
it important that a chemical examina
tion should be made to determine its in
gredients. Hetherefori transferred the
powder remaining in tbe can to Dr. F.
Schill, Jr., of this city, for analysis.
Dr. Schill's report is as follows:
Johnstown, Penn., Dec. 2, 11W9.
I hereby certify tbat I have examined
chemically the sample of baking
powder forwarded to me by Dr. Critch
tield. The specimen Sint me contained
alum. Dk Francis Schill, J R.,
Ill Jackson Street
Alum is used in the manufacture of
the lower priced baking powders.' It is
a mineral poison, and for this reason
the sale of baking powders containing
it is prohibited in many states.
Your Danger Sow
Is from tbe overworked condition of
the liver and kidneys which are unable
to expel impurities from the blood.
This causes rheumatism. Hood's Sar-
saparilla has been wonderfully success
ful in curing this disease. It neutrali
zes tbe acid ia tbe blood and perma
nently cures the acbes and pains which
other medicines fail to relieve. Hood's
Sarsaparilla is the best winter medi
cine because it purifies, enriches and
vitalizes the blood. It gives help just
where help is needed. It tones the
stomach, stimulates the liver, and
arouses and sustains tbe kidueys. It
wards off pneumonla,fever!,broncbill9,
colds, coughs and the grip.
Puzzled. "Papa!"
"What?"
"Does tbe fall of nig'it have any
thing to do with the break of day ?"
As a cure for rheumatism Chamber

Twenty-five Tears' Constant Use
Without a Failure.
The first indication of croup is hoarse
ness, and in a child subject to that dis
ease it may be taken as a sure sign of
the approach of aa attack. Following
thii hoarseness is a peculiar rough
cough. If Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy is given as soon as the child be
comes hoarse, or even after the croupy
cough appears, it will prevent tbe at
tack. It is used in many thousands of
homes in this broad laud and never
disappoints tbe anxious mothers. We
have yet to learn of a single instance
in which it has not proved effectual.
No other preparation can show such a
record twenty-five years' constant use
without a failure. For sale by all

alone exceeded by mre than a billion
dollars our imparts and exparts cm-
bined in 1S7J. The imports pr capita
are 20 percent less thaa in ls7J, while
the exports per capita are 53 per cent
more than in 1S70, showing the enlarg
ed capacity of tbe United States to
satisfy the wants of its own increasing
population, as well as to contribute to
those of the peoples of other natious.
THE TREASURY SURPLUS.
The strong position of the treasury
with respect to cash on hand and th
favorable showing made by the reve
nues have made it possible for tbe sec
retary of the treasury to take action
under the provisions of section 3i!H
revised statutes, relating to tbe sinking
fund. Receipts exceeded expenditures
for the first five months of tbe current
fiscal year by $13,413,3.91, and as
mentioned above, tbe Secretary of tbe
Treasury estimates that there will be a
surplus of approximately f W,000,0aD at
the end of the year. Under such con
ditions it was deemed advisable and
proper to resume complianca with tbe
provisions of the sinking fund law,
which for eight years has not been
done because of deficiencies in the rev
enues. The treasury department there
fore offered to purchase during No
vember $25l000,0U0oflbe5 per cent loan
r-f 1904, or tbe 4 per cent funded loan
of 1907, at the current market price.
The amount offered and purchased
during November was f lS,4 s,0X. The
premium paid by the government oa
such purchases was $i,2J.i,521 and tbe
net saving in interest was about 2,8S,-
000. The success of this operation wis
sufficient to induce tba government to
continue the offer to purchase bonds to
including the 211 dty of December,
instant, unless tbe rem tinder of the
i y,0M,OM called for should ba present
ed in the meantime f r redemption.
THE CURREXC V.
Increased activity ia industry, with
its wholesome atteud-tat a larger em
ployment for labrat higher waes
gives to the bly of tfu people a
larger power to absorb tbe circulating
medium. It is further true tbat year
by year, with larger areas of land
under cultivation, tbe Increasing vol
u ne of agricultural products, c tton,
corn and wheat, calls for a larger vol
ume of money SMpply. Tnis is especial
ly noticeable atf tbe crop-harvesting
and crop-moving period.
In Its earlier history tbe national
banking act, seemed to prove a reason
able avenue through which needful ad
ditions to the circulation could from
time to time be made. Changing con
ditions have apparently rendered it
now inoperative to tbat end. Tbe high
margin in bond securities required, re
sulting from large premlutas which
government bonds command In tbe
market, or tbe tax on note issues, or
both operating together, appear to be
the influences whiJi impair its public
utility. f
The attention of Congress is respect
fully invited to this important matter
wita tbe view of ascertaining whether
or no such reasonable modifications
can be made hi' tbe national banking
act as will render its service iu the par
ticulars here referred to more respon
sive to the people's needs. I again
urge that national banks be authorized
to organize with a capital of 125,000.
THE GOLD STANDARD.
I urgently recommend tbat to sup
port the existing geld standard, and to
maintain "tbe parity in value of tbe
coins of the two.metaLj (gold and sil
ver) and the equal power of every dol
lar at ali times in tbe market and in
the payment of debts," tbe Secretary
of the Treasury be given additional
power and charged witu tbe duly to
sell United States bonds and to employ
auch other effective means as may be
necessary to these end. The authori
ty should include the power to sell
bonds on long and short time, as condi
tions may require, and should provide
for a rate of interest lower than that
fixed by tbe act of January 14, 187.
Wnile there is now no commercial
fright which withdraws gold from the
government, but, on the contrary, such
widespread confidence that gold seeks
the treasury demanding paper money
la exchange, yet tbe very situation
points to the present as the most fitting
time to make adequate provision to in
sure the continuance of tbe gold stand
ard and of public confidence in the
ability and purpose of the government
to meet all its obligations in the money
which the civilized world recoguizes as
the best Tbe financial transactions of
tbe government are conducted upon a
gold basis. We receive gold wbea we
sell United States bonds and use gold
for tbeir payment We are maintain
ing the parity of all tbe money issue J
or coined by authority of tbe govern
I
ment We are doing these things with
the means at hand. Happily at tbe
present time we are not compelled to
resort to loans to supply gold. It has
been done in tbe past however, and
may have to be domt in tbe future. It
behooves us, therefore, to provide at
once the best means to meet the emer
gency when ' It arises and the best
means are those which are tbe roost
certain and economical. Those now
authorized have tbe virtu neither of
directness nor economy. We have al
ready eliminated one of the causes of
our financial plight and embarrass
ment during the years H03, 1SU4, 1S95
and 138A. Our receipts now equal our
expenditures; deficient revenues no
longer create alarm. Let us remove
the only remaining cause by conferring
tbe full and necessary power on the
Secretary of tbe Treasury and impose
upon him tbe duty to uphold the pres
ent gold standard and preserve tbe coins
of tbe two metals on a parity with each
other, which is the repeatedly declared
policy of the United States.
In this connection I repeat my for
mer recommendations that a por
tion of the gold holdings shall be
placed in a trust fund from which
greenbacks, shall be redeemed upon
presentation, but when once redeemed
shall not thereafter be paid out except
for gold.
THE TRUSTS.
The message discusses tbe need of en
cou raging the growth of our merchant
marine, and recommends government
aid, but uo particular method is indica
ted. Tbe subject of trusts is then taken
up, aud quotations are made from mes
sages by President Harrison aud Presi
dent Cleveland. The existing laws
against trusts are summarized, aud the
President says: Tbe prosecution by tbe
United btates of offenses under the act
of. IS. 10 has been frequently resorted to
in tbe federal courts, and notable efforts
in the restraint of Interstate commerce,
such as tbe Trans-Missouri Freight As
sociation and tbe Joint Traffic Associa
tion, have been successfully opposed
and suppressed. " '
It is universally conceded tbat com
binations which engross or control the
market of any particular kind of mer
chandise or commodity necessary to
tbe general community, by suppressing
natural and ordinary . competition,
whereby prices are unduly enhanced to
the general consumer, are obnoxious
not only to the common law, but also
to the public welfare.
There must be a remedy for the evils
involved in such organizations. If the
present law can be extended more cer
tainly to control or check these monop
olies or trusts, it should be done with
out delay. Whatever power the Con
gress possesses over this most import
ant subject should be promptly ascer
tained and asserted.
Tbe whole question is so important
and far-reaching that I am sure no part
of it will be lightly considered, but ev
ery phase of it will have the studied de
liberation of the Congress, resulting in
wise and judicious action.
FOREIOX RELATIONS.
The message then proceeds to give a
review of our relations with foreign
states.
An appropriation for a commission
to study tbe commercial and industrial
conditions in tbe Chinese empire is ear
nestly recommended.
THE CU BAN PROBLEM.
The withdrawal of the authority of
Spjiu from the island of Cuba was ef
fected by the first of January, so tbat
the full re-establishment of peace found
the relinquished territory held by us in
trust for tbe inhabitants, maintaining,
uuder tbe direction of tbe executive,
such government and control therein as
should conserve public order, restore
the productive conditions of peace, so
long disturbed by the instability and
dishonor which prevailed for tbe great
er part of tbe three preceding decades,
and build up that tranquil development
of tbe domestic state whereby alone
can be realized the high purpose, as
proclaimed ia the. Joint resolution
adopted by the Congress on the 19th
of April, 1898, by which the United
States disclaimed any disposition or In
tention to exercise sovereignty, juris
diction or control over Cuba, except for
the pacification thereof, and asserted iu
determination when that was accom
plished to leave the government and
control of tbe inland to its people. The
pledge contained in this resolution is of
tbe highest honorable obligation, and
must be sacredly kept .
I believe that substantial progrees baa
been made iu this direction. All the
administrative measures adopted in
Cuba have aimed t Ct it for a regener
ated existence by enforcing the suprem
acy of law and justice; by placing,
wherever practicable, the machinery
of administration in tbe hands of tbe
inhabitants; by instituting needed san.
itary reforms; by spreading: education;
by fostering industry and' trade; by in
culcating public morality, and, in short,
by taking every rational step to aid tbe
Cuban people to attain to tbat plane of
self-conscious respect and self-reliant
unity which fits an enlightened com
munity for self-government within its
own sphere, while enabling it to fulfill
all outward obligations.
This nation has assumed before the
world a grave responsibility for the fu
ture good government of Cuba. We
have accepted a trust the fulfillment of
which calls for the sternest integrity of
purpose and tbe exercise of the highest
wisdom. Tbe new Cuba yet to arise
from tbe ashes of the past must needs
be bound to as by ties of singular inti
macy and strength if its enduring wel
fare is Xo be assured. Whether those
ties shall be organic or conventional,
the destinies of Cnba are ia some right
ful form and manner Irrevocably link
ed with our own, but how and how far
is for the future to determine in tbe
ripeness of events. Whatever be tbe
outcome we must see to it that free Cuba
be a reality, not a name, a perfect enti
ty. Dot a hasty experiment bearing
within itself the elements of failure.
Our mission, to accomplish which we
took up the wager of battle, ia not to be
fulfilled by turning adrift any loosely
framed commonwealth to face tbe vi
cissitudes which too often attend weak
er states whose natural wealth and
abundant resources are offset by the in
eongrultfea of their political organiza

tion and tbe recurring occasioas for in
ternal rivalries to sap tbeir strength
and dissipate their energies. Tbe great
est blessing which can. come to Cuba is
the res to ration of her agricultural and
Industrial prosperity, which will give
employment to Idle men and re-estab
lish the pursuits of peace. This is ber
chief and immediate need. ;
On the 19th of August lat an order
was made for tbe taking of (he census
in tbe island, to be completed on the
:t0th of November. By the treaty of
peace tbe Spanish people on tbe island
have until April 11, 1900, to elect wheth
er tbey will remain citizens of Spain or
become citizens of Cuba. Until then it
can not be definitely ascertained who
shall be entitled to participate in tbe
formation of tbe government of Cuba.
By tbat time the results of the census
will have been tabulated, and we shall
proceed to provide for elections which
will commit tbe municipal govern
ments of the island to the otTlcers elect
ed by the people. The experience thus
acquired will prove of great value in
the formation of a representative con
vention of the people to draft a consti
tution and establish a geueral system of
independent government for tbe island.
In the meantime, and so long as we ex
ercise control over the island, the prod
ucts of Cuba should have a market in
tbe United States on as god terms and
witb aa favorable rates of duty as are-
given to the West India islands under
treaties of reciprocity which shall le
made.
For the relief of tbe distressed in the
island of Cuba the war department has
issued supplies to destitute persons
through tbe officers of the army, wbkb
have amounted to 5,403,000' rations, at
a cost of 1 1,4 17,554. 07.
To promote the disarmament of tbe
Cuban volunteer army, and In tbe In
terest of public peace and tbe welfare
of the people, tbe sum cf $75 was paid
to each Cuban soldier borne upon tbe
authenticated rolls, on condition that
he should deposit his arms with tbe
authorities designated by the Uuited
States. Tbe sum thus disbursed aggre
gated $2,547,750, which was paid from
tbe emergency fund provided by tbe
act of January 5, 1S99, for tbat purpose.
Out of tbe Cuban island revenues du
ring tbe six months ending June 30,
1S90, (1,712.014 20 wasexpended for san

destitute.
A MEDAL FOR THE VOLUNTEERS.
Since my last annual message, and
ia obedience to the acts of tbe Congress
of April 22 and 26, 1398, tbe remaining
volunteer force enlisted for the Spanish
war, consisting of 34,834 regulars and
110.202 volunteers, with over 5,000 vol
unteer ofilcera. baa been discharged
from tbe military rervice. Of the vol
unteer, 67 officers and 13,831 men
wera serving in the Philippines, and
1,651 of the regulars, who were entitled
to be mustered out after the ratification
of the treaty of peace. Tbey volunta
rily remained at tbe frout until their
places could be filled by new troops.
Tbey were returned home in tbe order
in which they went to Manila, and are
now all of them out of the 'service and
in tbe ranks of citizenship. - I recom
mend thut tbe Congress ' provide a
special medal of honor for the volun
teers, regulars, sailors, and marines on
duty in the Philippines who volunta
rily remained in tbe service after tbeir
terms of enlistment bad expired.

THE PHILIPPINES.
On tbe 10th of D.-cember, ISfeM, the
treaty of peace between Spain and the
Uuited States was signed. It provided,
among other things, that Spain should
cede to tbe United States tbe archipel
ago known as the Philippine Islands,
and that the United States should pay
to Spain tbe sum of $20,000,003, and
that tbe civil rights and political status
of tbe native inhabitants of the terri
tories thus ceded to the United States
vhould be determined by Congress.
The treaty was ratified by the Senate
on the 6th ot February, 1899 and by
the government of Spain on the 19tb of
March following. The ratifications
were exchanged on the 1 1th of April,
and the treaty publicly proclaimed.
On the 2d of March the Congress voted
tbe sum contemplated by tbe treaty,
and the amount was paid over to the
Spanish government on the 1st of
May.
Ia this manner the Philippines came
to the United States. The Islands were
ceded by the government of Spain,
which had been in undisputed posses
sion of them for centuries. Tbey were
accepted not merely by our authorized
commissioners in Paris, under the di
rection of the executive, but by the
constitutional and well-considered ac
tion of the representatives of tbe peo
ple of the Uuited States in both houses
of Congress. I bad every reason to be
lieve, and I still believe, that this trans
fer of sovereignty was in accordance
with tbe wishes and the aspirations of
tbe great mass of tbe Filipino people.
From the earliest moment ho oppor
tunity was lost of assuring the people
of the islands of our ardent desire for
their welfare aud of the intention of
this government to do everything pos
sible to advance their Interest In my
order of tbe 19th of My, 1S9S, tbe com
mander of tbe military expedition dis
patched to the Philippines was instruct
ed to declare tbat we came not to make
war upon the people of that country,
"nor upon any party or faction among
them, but to protect them ia tbeir
homes, la their employments, and In
their personal and religious rights."
Tbat there should be no doubt as to the
paramount authority there, on tbe 17th
of August it was directed that "there
must be no joint occupation witb the
insurgents;" that tbe Uuited States
must preserve peace and protect per
sons and property within tbe territory
occupied by their military and uaval
forces; that the insurgents and all
others must recognize tbe military oc
cupation and authority f the Uuited
States. As early as December 4. be
fore tbe cession and ia anticipation of
that event, tbe commander ia Manila
was urged to restore peace and tran
quility and to undertake the establish
ment of a beneficent government,
hich should afford the fullest security
for life and property.
On the 21st of December, af er tbe
treaty of peace was sinned, tbe com
mander of tbe forces of occupation was
instructed "to announce and proclaim
in tbe most public manner, tbat we
come, not as invaders and conquerors.
but as friends to protect the natives la
their homes, iu their employment,
and In tbeir personal and religious
rights." uu the same day, while or
dering Gen. Otis to se that the peac
should be preserved in Iloiio, be was
admonished tba': "It U most Import
ant there should 1 no conflict witb
tW iusurgeriL." On the 1st day of
January, IKO, urgeut orders were reit
erated that the kindly intentions of
this government should be in every
way communicated to the insurgents.
On tbe 21st of January I announced
my intention of dispatching to Manila
a commission of three gentlemen of the
highest character and distinction thor
ouzhly acquainted with the Orient,
who, in association with Admiral
Dewey and Maj. Gen. Otis, were In
structed to "facilitate the most humaoe
and etrective extension of authority
throughout the islands, and to secure
with the least possible delay the bene
fits of a wise and generous protection of
life aud property to the inhabitants."
These gentlemen were Dr. Jacob
Gould Scbuman, president of Cornell
University; the Hou. Charles Deuby,
for many years minister to China, and
Prof. Deau C. Worcester, of the Univer
sity of Michigan, who had made a moat
careful study of life in the Philippines.
While tbe treaty of peace was under
consideration iu tbe Senate these com
missioners set out on tbeir mission of
good will and liberation. Their char
acter was a sufficient guaranty of the
beneficent purpose with which they
went, even if they had not borne the
positive instructions of this govern
ment, which made their errand pre
eminently one of peace aud friendship.
OUTBREAK Or' THE INSURRECTION.
But before their arrival at Manila tbe
sinister ambition of a few leaders of tbe
Filipinos had created a situation full of
embarrassment for us and most griev
o is in its consequences to themselves.
