NEW YORK. Dec. 10.—A special to the
BTibur.e from Washington say-.
A report that the preeident intenda to visit
and Porto Rico at the first favorable
opportunity has Ucomt known in the atate,
w and navy departments, and waa quick
|y made the -subject of serious fcpeculatton
among various officials on account of tha
exceedingly interesting questions it raised.
Am ong other thing 3 there was a apontane
«ta revival of the Action that t&e chief ex
acative could not pass the boundaries of the
United Spates without forfeiting his office.
.It is peculiar how persistent is the notion
«ven am >T.K higher officials that some con
stitutional or statutory restriction confines
the executive to American soil, when, as a
Blatter of fa» % a.'nough none of President
McKiniey*"! pr<-d«- '-."sor* have ever left the
eountry during t..e.r term* of office, their
actions w>re alone affected by
tions of propriety or precedent, which no
one could hoid to apply in the present in
glance. It *!U generally recognized that
the president might j aturally wish to make
g personal t>ur of Inspection in those isl
ands as soon as he could spare the time
from pre».ng public business in Washing

against such a tour as he was understood
to contemplate it is pointed out, how
ever, that it would be practically impossi
ble for him to B(xire the time requisite for
auch an extended voyage a* that to Porto
Biro before congress adjourns on March 4,

of year to make a short stay in the tropics.

will be no leisure for the executive, and
therefore his pennant could hardly fly in
the harbors of Porio Rico before the mid

With llavHria only a single night's run
for the dispatch boat Dolphin from Tampa,

president would n>t care to set foot In Cuba
1" it wer* held to be foreign territory, much
a * J 3 * might wish to ste the country, foi
** a Pertloufi precedent to es
i t*"*lrtj. But no one appears to controvert
the r;ght as well as the advisability of th«
•xt-cotiTt visit to the new American pos
sessions, provided it does not involve toe
lor;g a n enforced absence from Washing
ton. Before the outbreak of the war with
Spain the of a presidential vi.-i:
to Hawaii wm thoroughly canvass-*!. Ii
was held by competent authorities that tht
president would not t« compelled to leave
the Jurisdiction of the United States, even
, momentarily, during such a tour, as he
j would be constantly or, American territory
on a national vessel, even when on the high
seas.
In this case, however, the long voyage
would have required the president to be
wiuiout means of communication with
Washington for at least a we#-k at a time,
and even had there tx-en a cable to Hono
lulu, he would have been out of touch wit
the country for at least two periods of flv
days each. These considerations prohl
ited further contemplation of the visit.
When the president visits Porto Rico d
Cuba he will undoubtedly be aecompr *'■£
by Mrs. McKinley and several memt*

the stay of the j>arty in each port
will not be longer than a single an

i Lnr? I lr • The address of the
Chamber of Commerce
f:\Zr l Sti** «• **» of thunder, caus-
sides of the channel,
• «r'°P le had affected to discern
! f outline of a peace ra.nbow
! j?«* and Great Britain as a
SP q IK j ta « passing over of the Fashoda
St ThT fi imnression was that Sir Ed-
I yhson had received a cue from
th- \r, ul « of Salisbury to give a candid
weria7 to *" ran °e that Great Britain is
j ,- termined not to stand any further
k rioiiser.se. This opinion still pre
f'.JU though it has been somewhat modi
r. 'p the explanation which the amt>assa
j'' e.nt to the French press. It Is now
{ ,'ght Munson got an official tip to give
jiice a warning, but that he spoke more
, aly than waa intended. The address,
wever, has served as a reminder to the
eopie of both countries that the tire of
i»e Soudan embrogiio is still smoldering
tnd may burst into flame before it *
inally disposed of. The ambassador's
varning. according to those qualified to
mow, was prompted by the fact that the
•'rench government, sulking over the Mar
hand affair, ts evading d.plomatic d.scus
lion of pending Anglo-French problems,
iiid was intended to intimate that with the
hange of French ambassadors at London
na week. Baron De Courcel being succeed
ed by M. I'aui Cambon, the Marquis of
Salisbury desired more active treatment of
he points in dispute.
Sir Edmund J. Munson's manly frank
itiß is quite characteristic of the
lor arid won for him the warm friendsh.D
■f Czar Aieiander and Emperor Franc s
fos»-pn, both of whom asked the British
ore-fcu office to send him to tluir resDoc
;lve capitals when he quitted Copenhagen,
«rhere we was persona grata at the
:ourt. He chose Vienna.
Air. Chamberlain's speech on Thursday.
;mbracirig the whole range of domestic and
'oreign politics, aroused as much interest
ibroud as at home. He forecasted the
luiusterial domestic legislation of the coni
ng session, and then held out tiie olive
i-ranch to every foreign country except
France, to which he administered a salu
ary caution, which has been but little rel
shed there, and which evoked all sorts of
lews paper threats to thwart Great Br;t
un's nrojecta.
Mr. Chamberlain spoke lukewarmly on
he subject of old age pensions, once his
scheme, and refrained from promising the
Dill which had been expected on the sub
iect. Uut he promised hve measures to as
sist the working class to acquire their own
1 Sellings, j romote secondary education
md to insure the safety and h-.-alth of
workers in dangerous trades. Mr. Cham
berlain's declaration that an agreement
vith Russia on Chinese affairs is desirable
ias made a d<~> p impression In view of his
'orrner utterances, in which, referring to
btUK-ia's evasion of agreements, he said:
"He who sups with the devil must have
i long spoon."
This remark gave great umbrage to the
zar, and it was then thought it boded ill
tor a future understanding.
The friendly references of Mr. Chamber
ain to Germany suggesting mutual help in
natters of common interest have met with
i favoraMte reception in Germany. Vhe
>res3 comments show veiled Joy at the pros
ed of an Anglo-German entente, but the
German papers refrain from an effusive
llsplay of gladness, evidently with the
>iew of securing the best part of the bar
fain.
The Liberal Leadership.
The question cf the Liberal leadership,
ivhleh has been j n abeyance, came to the
'rent this week in the form of a notice bv
he Nottingham Liberal Association that
t will raise the matter at the meeting of
the National Libera - . Federation on Dee m

:hough it is understood the officials will

lon Hareourt's position in the nominal

jeeause it has n,»t been definitely establish

re eel \ed a rude shaking when Lord Rose

UORKKU FOR RECIPROCITY.
Both Sides of the Anglo-America*
Commission Discuss the Matter.
WASHINGTON', Dec. 10.—Both sides of
the Anglo-American commission held
meetings today, to pave the way for the
joint session on Monday, when efforts will
be continued to get together on some ba
sis of reciprocity. At the meeting today
each side canvassed the extent of conces
sions it was ready to grant and expected
to receive.
While the differences are quite material,
members of the commission said today that
there was no reason to take a discouraging
.view of the outlook, as there were strong
hopes that the differences on reciprocity,
which are conceded to be the chief obstacle,
could he reconciled. It is said President
McKinley has taken occasion, during re
cent talks with members of the commission,
to express a most earnest desire that suc
cessful results come of the negotiations.

Thousands of Persons Who Believed Themselves Doomed to Remain Lifelong: Vic*

So extended and firmly established has
become the reputation of the Copeland
specialists in the cure of chronic catarrh
of ail forms that many suppose the special
skill of these physicians to be confined to
the treatment of that all-prevailing, in
sidious and dangerous disease, but such is
far from being the case. The same superb
mastery they have over that great enemy
of the human race, they also posst«s over
chronic diseases of alt kinds. No sufferer
from a chronic and wasting malady; no
person whose nerves throb with the tor
tvres of rheumatism; no pale, restless,
nervous, emaciated invalid, whose stom

Curing Catarrhal
Deafness, With

It la De»erving
of the confidence of the sick and of the
highest praise ever uttered in its favor. I
took the treatment after my hearing had
been almost destroyed by the pernicious ef
fects of catarrhal disease of the ears, and
the results more thau justify th.s state
ment.
"Sly trouble originated in a severe cold
from which 1 did not entirely recover, and
as a result of wh:»h I became extremely
sensitive to exposure in cold or damp
weather. After repealed colds, the stop
ped up condition of my head and the dis
charge from the nostrils gradually became
chronic in character, and the disease ex
tended to the throat and the tubes leading
to the earE.
"My throat was constantly filling up
with phlegm, which required a
PerMlKtent Hawking and Spitting
to remove, and the soreness and swelling
were RO serious that at limes I was in
danger of choking. Later on I began to
have pains through my ears, with intense
headaches, and the sense of hearing grew
less distinct, until I was unable to dis
tinguish the ordinary sounds of every-day
life. Finally, the right ear, which dis
charged a very offensive matter.
Became Totally Deaf.
"My Interest was aroused by the published
accounts of cases of deafness that had been
cured by the Copeland physicians, and I
went to the Institute and commenced a
course of treatment. As I said before, the
effects were highly satisfactory. My
Hearing: la .Vow Perfect,
the discharge from the ear has completely
disappeared, and I am no longer troubled
with catarrh."
