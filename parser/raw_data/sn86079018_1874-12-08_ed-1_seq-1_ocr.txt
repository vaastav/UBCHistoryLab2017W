[Associated Tress Dispatches.]
Vicesbueo, Dec. 7. — Engagements took
place this morning between the whites and the
negroes on the various roads leading into the
city. The negroes were repulsed and routed
at all points, with the loss of eighteen or
twenty killed and about the same number
wounded. Thirty or forty prisoners were
captured and lodged in jail.
One white man, Oliver Brown, of Snider's
Bluff, was killed. Policeman Burton wounded,
and George Batchelor accidentally shot
through the foot.
The citizens are still under arms and the
roads picketed Tbe excitement is subsiding.
The town negroc-s took no part in the diffi
culty.
There has been for -«me time trouble brew
ing between the Taxpayers Association and
citizens, and the co lnty officials. The sheriff'
was acting without a legal bond, and the
Board of Supervisors refused to order a new'
one, though the timt for paying the taxes had
arrived.
Two or three other officials were under
indictment for lorgerv and embezzlement,
and the citizens despairing of any relief
from partisan courts, last Wednesday held a
meeting, and in a body proceeded to the
court-house to demand the resignation of the
Sheriff, Chancery Clerk, Treasurer and Coro
ner. A'l fled except Sheriff Crosby, a negro,
and he signed his resignation.
Du Saturday a card appeared on the streets
signed Crosby, culling on all the citizens of
Waireu county, Republicans, white and black,
to come to Ins aid and support him in his
position. Crosby publicly and through the
papers-denied the authorship of the card, yet
this morning armed bodies of negroes appear
ed advancing on the city, from six different
roads.
The alarm was sounded about 0 o'clock, find
the citizens gathered en »/oosse, armed immedi
ately and advanced to meet the negroes on
Baldwin's Ferry road. The negroes were met
just outside City Gr» ve street, about two hun
dred strong. The commander of the citizens
warned the negroes to disperse, but they re
fused and immediately the firing commenced
on both sides.
The negroes retreated about a mile and
again made n sum»: ; . the old breastworks
uud in a house, but were soot, routed. The
loss in these engagements was one citizen
(Oliver Brown) killed, and about twelve or
fif.e n negroes killed, several wounded and
about twenty prisoners.
On Halt's ferry road about two hundred and
fifty negroes were ft -und routed after a short
engagement, with several killed and wounded.
Andrew Owens, who comm »mied the negroes
on Baldwin's ferry road, was captured and
committed to jail.
la an interview with a lierait reporter,
« > wens said he was ordered by .Sheriff' Crosby
to come to tho city today with all the aimed
men he could get together.
Alexander Stockhouse, from Newt m, one of
the captured negroes, says the order for all the
negroes to come to Vicksburg this morning',
Was read in their church Sunday.
Crosby, who is under guard at the Court
House, denies that he .-ave such orders.
It is reported this evening that the negroes
S re committing depredations in the country.
'he intense excit» ment that prevailed this
morning has subsided to a great degree, yet
many citizens are still under arms and all the
roads are picketed.
At a public me» ling this evening the follow
ing was adopted :
Resolved, That while we are fully satisfied
that Peter Crosby has caused armed negroes
to march on the city »»ml should therefore be
held maiuly responsible for all the blood that
has been shed. We recommend fill good citi
zens to abstain iron: inflicting any personal
violence upon Lim, and that we use still
further efforts to have him removed from
office iu some legal manner.
Latest. —Evidence just received renders it
absolutely certain that Gov. Ames and his
Attorney General, Geo. E, Harris, incited and
advided the invasion o; this city by the ne
groes to-day. This evidence has been laid
before the ablest lawyers of the city, with a
view to arresting and bringing these parties to
this Sty tor trial.
THE FAIR AT ORB FELLOWS' HALL.
Those who visite« Odd Fellows' Hall last
evening ,were doubtless attracted by a large
and elegant American flag, displayed as a
canopy over the table at which Mrs. Hill pre
sided. Much interest is manifested in the
disposition that will be made of this flag, for
three daily journals are contesting for it, or
rather, the friends of the /'.'»•.«/»<, .e, Times and
Bulletin, are contesting its possession for
the paper of their choice; hence it may be
presumed that a lively contest will occur.
\ *!» Mrs. Hill's table there is also a very
bLrkiful silver pitcher tor the possession of
wLilea three contestants are in the field—
Mfysrs. Marr and Penn, and Gen. Ogden.
These gentlemen have legions of friends, and
numerous will be the votes cast lor each.
At the Eureka table there is exhibited a
Maltese cross, set with diamonds, to be voted
to the most popular Commandery of Knights
Templar. The ladies at this table will be
burdened with wealth, for the contest here
promises to be earnest and exciting. To tho
charming attendants at this table the weary
workers of the Bulletin office extend earnest
thanks for kind recognition given iu the form
of a choice lunch.
Kellogg Cannot Hub Along with Emo
ry.—I t has leaked out to-night that one of the
objects of the rush to Washington by the lead
ing Radicals is to get Gen. Emory ordered
before the Returning Board and the assign
ment to the 'command of Gen. Alfred Terry,
of Connecticut. Emory, it appears, was too
good a soldier to be used by the Kellogg
Field-Packard-Merrill gang to defeat the will
of the people. This is the height of Emory's
offense.— X Y. Ilcruld.
In view of the reward that has been offered
for his capture, " Governor" Smith, of Arkan
sas, objects to being recognized by any one
except the President.
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Washington, Dec. 7, 1871.
To the Senate and House of Representatives:
Since the convening of Congress one year
ago the natioD has undergone a prostration iu
business and industries such as has not been
witnessed with us for many years. Specula
tion as to the causes for this prostration
might be indulged in without profit, because
as many theories would be advanced as there
would be independent writers—those who ex
pressed their own views, without borrowing,
upon the subject
With out indulging in theories as to the cause
of this prostration, therefore, I will call your at
teutiononly to the fact, and to some plain ques
tions as to which it would seem there should
be no disagreement. During this prostration
two essential elements of prosperity have been
most abundant—labor and capital ; both have
been largely unemployed, where security has
been undoubted. Capital has been attainable
at very moderate rates ; where labor has been
wanted it has been found in abundance at
cheap rates compared with what of necessaries
and comforts of life could be purchased with
the wages demanded.
Two great elements of prosperity ther fore
have not been denied us. A third might be
added—our soil and climate are unequalled
within the limits of any contiguous territory
under one nationality lor its variety of pio
ducts to feed und clothe a people, and in the
amount ot surplus to spare to feed less la-°
vored peoples. Therefore, with these facts in
view, it seems to me that wise statesmanship
at this session of Congress would dictate legis
lation ignoring the past, directing in proper
channels these great elements ot prosperity to
any people.
Debt abroad is the only element that can,
with always a sound currency, enter into our
affairs to 'cause continued depression in the
industries and prosperity of our people. A
great conflict for national existence made it
necessary for temporary purposes—the rais
ing of large sums of money from whatever
source attainable.
It was necessary iu the wisdom of Congress,
au»l I do not doubt their wisdom in the pre
mises, regarding the necessity of the times,
to devise a system of national currency which
proved to be impossible to keep on a par with
the- recognized currency of the civilized world.
This begot a spirit of speculation, involving
an extravagance ami luxury not required for
the happiness or prosperity of a people, and
involving both directly or indirectly foreign
indebtedness. The currency being of a fluc
tuating value, and therefore unsafe to hold for
legitimate transactions requiring money, be
came a subject of speculation in itself. These
two causes, however, have involved us in a
foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith
by borrower and lender, which should be paid
in coin; and, according to the bond agreed
upon when the debt was contracted, gold or
its equivalent.
Tue good faith of the Government cannot
be violated toward creditors without national
disgrace, but our commerce should be en
couraged, American shipbuilding carrying
capacity increased, foreign markets sought
for products of the soil and manufactories, to
the end that we may be able to pay these
debts. Where a new market can be created
lor the sale of our products either of the soil,
the mine or the manufactory, a new moans is
discovered of utilizing our idle capital and
labor to the advantage of the whole people.
But iu my judgment the first steps toward
accomplishing this object is to secure a cur
rency ot fixed stable value; a currency, good
wherever civilization reigns; one which, it it
becomes superabundant with one people will
find a market with some other; a currency
which has as its basis the labor necessary to
produce it, which will give to it its value.
Gold and silver are now tho recognized
mediums of exchange the civilized world
over, and to this wo should return with the
least practicable delay in view of the pledges
of the American Congress when our present
legal tender system was adopted and debt
contracted. There should be no delay, cer
tainly no unnecessary delay, in fixing, by
legislation, a method by which we will return
to specie. To the accomplishment of this end
I invite your special attention. I believe firmly
that there can be no prosperous and perma
nent revival of business and industries until a
policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it
out, looking to a return to a specie basis.
It is easy to conceive that tho debtor and
speculative classes may think it of value to
(hem to make so-called money abundant, un
til they can throw a portion of their burdens
upon others: but even these I believe wouid
be disappointed in the result if a course
should be pursued which will keep iu doubt
the value of the legal tender medium of ex
change. A revival of productive industry is
needed by all classes—by none more than the
holders of property of whatever sort, with
debts to liquidate from realization upon its
sale. But admitting that these two classes ot
citizens are benefited by expansion, would it
be honest to give it ? Would not the general
loss be too great to justify such relief?
Would it not be just as honest and prudeut
to authorize each debtor to issue his own
legal tenders to the extent of his liabilities ?
Than to do this, would it not be safer, for
fear of over issues by unscrupulous creditors,
to say that all debt obligations are obliterated
in the United States, and now we commence
anew, each possessing all he has at the time
free from incumbrance ? These propositions
are too absurd to be entertained for a moment
by thinking or honest people; yet even' delay
in preparation for finul resumption partakes
of this dishonesty, and it is only less in de
gree as the hope is held out that a convenient
season will at last arrive for the good work ot
redeeming our pledges to commence. It will
never come, in my opinion, except by positivo
action by Congress, or by national disasters,
which will dest.oy, for a time at least, the
credit of the individual and the State at lirge.
A sound currency might be reachtd by total
bankruptcy and discredit of the integrity of
the nation and of individuals. I believe it is
in the power of Congress at this session, to
devise such legislation as will renew confi
dence, revive all the industries, start us on a
career of prosperity, to last for many years,
and to save the credit of the nation and ot the
people. Steps toward the return to a specie
basis are the great requisites to this devoutly
to-be-sought-tor end. There are others
which I may touch upon hereafter. A na
tion dealing in a currency below specie in
value labors under two great disadvantages :
First. Having no use for the world's ac
knowledged mediums of exchange, gold and
silver, these are driven out of the country
because there is no demand for their use.
Second. The medium of exchange in use
being of a fluctuating value ; for, after all, it
is only worth just what it will purchase of
gold and silver. Metals having an intrinsic
value, just in proportion to the honest labor
that it takes to produce them, a larger margin
must be allowed for profit by the manufacturer
and producer. It is mouths from the date of
production to the date of realization. Interest
npon capital must be charged and risk of
fluctuation in the value of that whi»*h is to be
received in payment added ; hence, high
prices, acting as a protection to the foreign
producer who receives nothing in exchange
tor the products of his skill and labor except
a currency good at a stoble value the world
a
as
is
ns
to
is
|
ov l r ' , to me that nothing is cleared than
tbit the greater put of the burden of existing
prostration for the want of a sound financial
system falls upon the working man,who must,
after all, produce the wealth : and the salaried
man, who superintends and conducts busi
ness. The burden falls upon them in two
ways—by the deprivation of employment, and
by the decreased purchasing power of their
salaries.
It is the duty of Congress to devise the
method of correcting the evils which are ac
knowledged to exist, and not mine. But I
will venture to suggest two or three things
which seem to me as aosolutely necessary to
a return to specie payments, the first great
requisite in a return to prosperity.
The legal tender clause to the law author
izing the issue of currency by the National
Government should be repealed, to take effect
as to all contracts entered into after a day
fixed in tbe repealing act, not to apply, how
ever, to payments of salaries by the Govern
ment or for other expenditures now provided
by law to be paid iu currency in the interval
pending between repeal and final resumption.
Provision should be made by which the Secre
tary of the Treasury can obtain gold as it may
become necessary from time to time from the
date when specie redemption commences. To
this might an»l should be added a revenue
sufficiently in excess of expenses to insure an
accumulation of gold in the treasury to sus
tain redemption.
I commend this subject to your careful con
sideration, believing that a favorable solution
is attainable, and that if reached by this Con
gress, that the present and tuture generations
will ever gratefully remember it as their de
liverer from a thraldom of evil and disgrace
With resumption, lrte banking may be au
thorized with safety, giving lull protection to
bill holders which they have upder existing
laws. Indeed, I would regard 1'ree banking
ns essential; it would give proper activity to
the currency. As more currency should be
required for the transaction of legitimate
business, new banks would be started, and, in
turn, banks would wind up their business
whin it was found that there was a super
abundance of currency.
The experience and judgment of the peo
ple can best decide just how much currency is
required for tho transaction of the business of
the country. It is unsafe to leave the settle
ment of this question to Congress, the Secre
tary of tho Treasury, or the Executive. Con
gress should make the regulation under which
banks may exist,but should not make banking a
monopoly by limiting the amount of redeema
ble paper currency that shall be authorized.
Such importance do I attach to this subject,
and so earnestly do I commend it to your at
tention, that I give it prominence by intro
ducing it at the beginning of this measaga.
During the past year nothing has occurred
to disturb the general friendly and cordial
relations of the United States with other
powers. The correspondence submitted here
with between this Government and its diplo
matic representatives, as also with the repre
sentatives of other countries, sflows a satis
factory condition of all questions between the
United States and the most of other countries,
and, with few exceptions—to which reference
is hereafter made—the absence of any points
of difference to be adjusted. The notice
directed by the resolution of Congress of June
17, 1874. to be given to terminate the Conven
tion of July 17, 1858, between the United States
and Belgium, has been given, and the treaty
will accordingly terminate on the first day of
July, 1875.
This convention secured to certain Belgian
vessels entering the ports of the Uuited States
exceptional privileges which are not accorded
to our own vessels. Other features of the
convention have proved satisfactory, and have
tended to the cultivation of mutually bene
ficial commercial intercourse and lrieudly
relations between the tw-o countries. Ï hope
that negotiations, which have been invited,
will result in the celebration of another treaty
which may tend to the interests of both
countries.
Our relations with China continue to be
friendly. Inuring the past year the fear of
hostilities between China and Japan, growing
out of the landing ot an armed force upon the
Island of Formosa by the latter, has occa
sioned uneasiness. It is earnestly hoped,
however, that the diffimlties arising from this
cause will be adjusted, and that the advance
in civilization iii these empires may not be
retarded by a state ot war.
In consequence of the part taken by certain
citizens of the United States in this expedition,
our representatives in these countries have
been instructed to impress upon the Govern
ments of China and Japan the firm intention
of this country to maintain strict neutrality in
the event of hostilities, and to carefully pre
vent any infraction of law on tho part of our
citizens. Iu connection with this subject, I
call the attention of Congress to a generally
conceded fact that the great proportion of the
Chinese emigrants who come to our sbores
do not come voluntarily to make their homes
with us, and their labor productive of general
prosperity, but come uniter contracts with head
men, who own them almost absolutely. In a
worse form does this apply to Chinese women.
Hardly a perceptible percentage of them per
form any honorable labor, but they are brought
for shameful purposes, to the disgrace of the
communities where settled, and the great de
moralization of the youth of those localities.
If this evil practice can be legislated against,
it will be my pleasure, as well as duty, to en
force any regulation to secure so desirable an
end.
It is hoped that negotiations between the
Government of Japan and the treaty powers,
looking to the further opening of the Empire
and to the removal of various restrictions
upon trade and travel, may soon produce tho
results desired, which cannot fail to inure to
the benefit of all the parties,
Having on previous occasions submitted to
the consideration ot Congress the propriety of
the release of the Japanese Government from
the further payaient of tbe indemnity under
the convention of October 22, 1804, and as no
action had been taken thereon, it became my
duty to regard the obligations of the conven
tion as in force ; and as the other pow'ers
interested had received their portion of the
indemnity in full, the Minister of the United
States in Japan has, in behalt of this Govern
ment, received the remainder of the amount
due to the United States under the conven
tion of Simououski.
, I submit the propriety of applying the in
come of a part, if not of the whole, of this
sum to the education, in the Japanese lau
,, U!1 o e of a number of young men to be under '
oblmations to serve tho Government for a |
specified time as interpreters at tho Legation
and the Consulates iu Japan. A limped num
ber of Japanese youths might, at tho same
time, be educated iu our own vernacular, and
mutual benefits would result to both govern
ments. The importance of having our own
citizens competent and familiar with the lan
guage of Japan to act as interpreters and in
other capacities connected with the Legation
and Consulates iu that country, cannot readily
be overestimated. .

WiAiprfnn in settlement of the claims
„ Washington in settlement
of British subjects, arising from acts commit
ted between April 13, 1801, and April ff, 18'jo,
became payable under the terms ot the
treaty within the past year, and was
paid upon the 21st day of September, ls<4.
In this connection I renew my reeommenda
| tion made at the opening of the last session
of Congress, that a special court be created to
hear and deteimiue all claims of aliens again*
the United States arising from acts committed
against their persons or property during the
insurrection.
It appears equitable that opportunity should
be offered to citizens of other States to present
their claims, as well as to those British sub
jects whose claims were not admissible under
the late commission to the early decision of
some competent tribunal. To this end I re
commend the necessary legislation to organ
ize a court to dispose of all claims of aliens ot
the nature referred to in an equitable and
satisfactory manner and to relieve Congress
and tbe departments trout the consideration of
these questions.
The legislation neeessiry to extend to the
colony of Newfoundland certain articles of
the treaty ot Washington, of the 8th day of
May, 1871, having been had, a protocol to that
effect was signed in bebalf of the United States
and of Great Britain on the 28th day of May
last, and was duly proclaimed on the follow
ing day. A copy ot the proclamation is sub
mitted herewith.
A copy of the report of the commissioner
appointed under the act of March Iff, 1872,
for surveying and marking the boundary be
tween the Uuited States and the British pos
sessions irorn the Lake of the Woods to the
summit of the Rocky Mountains, is herewith
transmitted. I am happy to announce that
the good work of the commission has been
completed and tho entire line from the north
west corner of the Lake of the Woods to the
summit of the Rocky Mountains has been run
and marked upon the surface of the earth.
It is believed that the amount remaining un
expended of the appropriation made at the
last session of Congress will be sufficient to
complete the office work.
. I recommend that the authority of Con
gress bo given to the use of the unexpended
balancent the appropriation in the comple
tion of the work of the commission in mak
ing its report and preparing the necessary
maps.
The court known as the Court of Commis
sioners of Alabama Claims, created by an act
of Congress of the last session, has organized
and commenced its work, and it is to be hoped
that the claims admissable under tbe pro
visions of the act may be speedily ascei taiued
and paid.
It has been deemed advisable to exercise
the discretion conferred upon the Executive at
the last session by accepting the conditions
required by the government of Turkey for the
privilege of allowing citizens of the United
States to hold real estate in the former coun
try and by assenting to a certain change in
tho jurisdiction of courts iu the latter. A
copy of the proclamation upon these subjects
is herewith communicated.
There has been no material change in our
relations with the independent States of this
hemisphere which were working under the
dominion of Spain.
Marauding on the frontier between Mexico
and Texas still frequently takes place, despite
the vigilance of the civil and military author!
ties iu tluu quarter. The difficulty of check'
iug such trespasses along the course of a river
of such length as the Rio Grande, and so
often fordable, is obvious. It is hoped that
the efforts ot this Government will be second
ed by those of Mexico to the effectual sup
pression of these acts of wrong.
From a report upon tfie condition of the
business betöre the American and Mexican
Joint Claims Commission made by the agents
on the par: of the United States, and dated
Oct. 28, 1874, it appears that of the 1017
claims filed on the part of citizens of the
United States 483 had been finally decided,
and 75 were in the hands of the. umpire, leav
ing 402 to be disposed of, and of the ffff8
claims filed against tho U nited States, but 720
had been finally decided, 1 was before the
umpire and 271 remained to be disposed of.
Since the date ot such report other claims
have] been disposed of, reducing somewhat
the number still pending and others have been
passed upon by the Arbitrators. It has be
come apparent, in view of these figures, and
of the fact that the work devolving o.i the
umpire is particularly laborious, that the com
mission would be unable to dispose of the
en! ire number of claims pending prior to the
first day of February, 1875, the date fixed for
its expiration.
Negotiations arc pending looking to the
securing ot the results of the decisions which
have been reached, and to further extension of
the commission for a limited time which, it is
confidently hoped, wiU suffice to bring all the
business now before it to a final clo e.
The strite in the Argentine Republic is to
be deplored, both on account of the parties
thereto and from the probable effects on the
interests of those engaged in the trade to that
quarter, of whom the Umted States are among
the principal. As yet, sd far as I am aware,
there has been no violation of our neutrality
rights, which as well as oar duties in that re
spect, it shall be my endeavor to maintain
and observe.
It is with regret I announce that no further
payment has been received from the Govern
ment of Venezuela, on account of awards in
favor of citizens of the United States. Hopes
have been entertained that if that Republic
could escape both foreign and civil war for a
few years, its great natural resources would
enable it to honor its obligations. Though it
is now understood to be at peace with other
countries, a A serious insurrection is reported
to be in progress in an important region of
that Republic. This may be taken advantage
of as another reason to delay the payment of
the dues of onr citizens.
The deplorable strife in Cuba continues,
without any marked change iu the relative ad
vantages of the contending forces, the insur
rection continues, but Spain has gained no
superiority. Six years of strife give to the
insurrection a significance which cannot be
denied. Its duration and the tenacity of its
adherents, together with the absence of mani
fested power of suppression on the part of
Spain, cannot be controverted, and may make
some positive steps on the part of other pow
ers a matter of se;f-necessity.
I had confidently hoped at this time to be
able to announce the arrangement of some of
the important questions between this Govern
ment and that of Spain, but the negotiations
have been protracted. The unhappy intestine
dissensions of Spain command our profound
sympathy, and must be accepted as perhaps a
cause of some delay. An early settlement, in
part at least, of I he questions between the
rrnvornnirnts is hone;!. In the meantime.
awaiting the results of immediate pending no
' gotiatious, I defer a further and toller fomiuu
| mcation on the subject of the relations ot this
country and Spain.
I have again to call the attention of Congress
to the unsatisfactory condition of the existing
laws with reference to expatriation and the
election of nationality. Formerly, amid con
flicting opinions and decisions, it was difficult
to exactly determine how far the doctrine of
perpetual allegiance was applicable to citizens
of the United States. Congress by the Act of
the 27th of July, 1808, asserted tne abstract
right ot expatriation as a fundamental princi
. ~ , . - . - ,
! ple oi tens Government. .Notwithstandingsuch
assertion, and the necessity of frequent appli
! cation of the principle, no legislation has been
had defining what acts or tormilities shall
work expatriation, or when a citizen shall be
deemed to have renounced or to have lost his
citizenship. The importance of such defini
tion is obvious.
The representatives of the United States in
foreign countries are continually called upon
to lend their aid and the protection of the
United States to persons concerning the good
is
iu
to
of
is
or ths reality of whose citizenship there
is at least great question. In some cases the
provisions of the treaties furnish some guide,
iu others it seems to the persons claiming the
benefits ot citizinship while living in a for
eign country, contributing in no manner to
the performance of the duties of a ci'izen of
the United States, and without intention at
any time to return and undertake those duties,
to use the claims to citizenship of the United
States simply as a shield from the performance
of the obligations of a citizen elsewhere.
The status of children born of American
parents residing iu a foreign country, of
American women who have married aliens, of
American citizens residing abroad, where
such question is not regulated by treaty, are
all sources of frequent difficulty and discus
sion. Legislation on these and similar ques
tions, and particularly defining when and
under what circumstances expatriation can be
accomplished or is to be presumed, is espe
cially needed. In this connection I earnestly
call the attention of Congress to the difficul
ties arising from fraudulent naturalization.
The United States wisely, freely and liber
ally offers its citizenship to all who may come
iu good faith to reside within its limits, on
their complying with certain prescribed rea
sonable and simple formalities and conditions.
Aim >ug the highest duties of file Government
is tbat to afford firm, efficient and equal pro
tection to all its citizens, whether native bom
or naturalized.
Care should be Liken that a right carrying
with it such support from the Government
should not be fraudulently obtained, and
should be bestowed ou'y up» >n full proofs of a
compliance with the law, and yet frequent in
stances are brought to the attention of the
Government of illegal and fraudulent natural
ization, and of the unauthorized use of cer
tificates thus improperly obtained.
In some cases tbe fraudulent character of
the naturalization has appeared upon the face
of the certificate itself: iu others, examination
discloses tbat tbe holder had not com,died
with the law, and in others, certificates have
been obtained where tho persons holding
them, not only were not entitled to bo untuml
;ed, but had not even been within the United
States at the time of the pretended natural!/ 1 -
tion. Instances of each of these classe. of
iraud are discovered at our Legations, where
the certificates of naturalization are presented,
ulu r for the purpose of obtaining passports
or in dem lading the protection of the Lega
tion.
When tbe fraud is apparent on tho face of
such certificates they are taken up by the repre
sentatives of the Government and forwarded
to the department of State, but even then the
record ol' the court in which the fraudulent
naturalization occured remains and duplicate
certificates are readily obtainable upon the
presentation of these lor the issue of passports
or in demanding protection of the Govern
ment The fraud some times escapes notice and
such certificates are not unfrequently used iu
transactions of business to the deception and
injury of innocent parties. Without placing
any additional obstacles iu the way of tho
obtninment of Ecitizeuship by the worthy and
well intentioned foreigner, who comes in good
faith to cast his lot with ours, I earnestly
recommend further legislation to punish
fraudulent naturalization and to secure the
ready cancellation of the record of every na
turalization made in fraud.
Since my last annual message the exchange
has been ma»le of the ratification of treaties
of extradition with Belgium, Ecuador, Peru
and Salvador; also of a treaty of commerce
and navigation with Peru, and o*Je of com
merce and consular privileges with Salvador,
all of which have been duly proclaimed as has
also a declaration with Russia with reference
to trade marks.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
which by law is made directly to Congress and
forms no part of this message, will show the
receipts anil expenditures of the Government
for the last fiscal year; the amount received
from each source of revenue, and the amount
paid out for each of the departments of Gov
ernment. It will be observed from this report
that the amount of receipts over expenditure
has been but 82,344,882 30 for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1874, and that for the current
fiscal year the estimated receipts over expendi
tures will not much exceedjSO.ODO.OOO.
In view of the large national debt existing,
and the obligation to add one per cent per an
num to the sinking fund—a sum amounting
now to over 834,000,000 per annum—I sub
mit whether revenues should not be increased
or expenditures diminished to reach this
amount of surplus. Not to provide for the
sinking fund is a partial iailure to comply
with the contract and obligations of the Gov
ernment. At the last session ot Congress a
v. ry considerable reduction was made in tie
rates of taxation and iu the number of articles
submitted to taxation, the question may be
asked whether or not in some instances un
wisely.
Iu connection with this subject too, I ven
ture the opinion tbat tbe menus of collecting
the revenue, especially from imports, have
been so embarrassed by legislation as to make
it questionable whether or not large amounts
are not lost by failure to collect, to the direct
loss of tho treasury and to the prejudice of
the interests ol' honest importers and tax
payers. The Secretary of the Treasury in his
report favors legislation looking to an early
return to specie payments, thus supporting
views previously expressed in this message.
He also recommends economy in appropri
ations; calls attention to the loss of revenue
from repealing the tax on tea and coffee,
without benefit to the consumer: recommends
an increase of ten cents a gallon on whisky,
and further that no modification be made in
tbe banking and currency bill passed at the
last session of Congress, unless modification
should become necessary by reason of tbe
adoption of measures for returning to specie
payments. In these recommendations I cor
dially join.
I would suggest to Congress the propriety
of adjusting tne tariff' so as to increase the
revenue and at tbe same time decrease the
number of articles upon which duties are
levied. Those articles which enter into oui
manufactures, and are not produced at home,
it seems to me, should be entered free. Those
articles of manufacture which we produce a
constituent part of, but do not produce the
whole, that part which we do not produce
should be entered free also.
I will instance fine wool, dyes, etc. These
articles must be imported to form a part ol the
manufacture of the higher grades ot woolen
oods. Chemicals used as dyes compounded
in manufactures come under this class. The
introduction free of duty of such wools as w<
lo not produce, would stimulate the manufac
ture of goods requiring tho use of those we do
not produce, unu, tliereiore, would be a bene
fit to heme production. There are many ar
ticles entering int > home manufacture-, which
we do not produce our elves, the tariff upon
which increases the cost oi producing the
manufactured article.
All corrections in this regard are in the di
rection of bringing labor ami capital in har
mony with each other and of supplying one of
the elements of prosperity so. much
needed. The report of the Secretary
ot War, herewith* attached and forming
a part of this message, gives all the
information concerning the operations, wants
and necessities of the army, and contains
many suggestions and recommendations which
1 commend to your special attention. There
is no class of government employees who are
harder worked than the army officers and
men, none who perform their tasks more
I
(
cheerfully and efficiently and under circum
stances of greater privation and hardship.
Legislation is desirable to render mow
efficient this branch of the public service—all
the recommendations of the Secretary of War
I regard us judicious, and I especially com
mend to your attention the following: The
consolidation of government arsenals, the re
storation of mileage to officers traveling under
orders, the exemption of money received from
the sale of subsistence stores from being cov
ered into the Treasury; the use of appropria
tions tor the purchase of subsistence stores«
without waiting lor the beginning of the fiscal
year tor which tho appropriation is made; lor
additional appropriations for tho collection of
the torpedo material; for increased appropria
tions for the manufacture of arms; for reliev
ing the various States from indebtedness for
arms charged to them during the rebellion;
for dropping officers from the rolls of the army
without trial, for th»' offense of drawing pay
more than once for the same period; for the
discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by
checks, nnd for the establishment of profes
sorship of rhetorio and English literature at
West Point.
The reasons for these recommendations are
obvious and are set forth sufficiently in the
report attached. I also recommend that the
status of the staff corps of the army bo fixed.
Where this has not already been done so that
promotions may be made und vacancies tilled
as they occur in each grade, when redneed
below the number to be fixed by law. Tbe
necessity for such legislation is especially
felt now in the pay department. The number
of officers in that department is inadequate tat
the perlormauec of the duties required of them
.by law.
The efficiency of the navy has been
largely increased duriug the last year.
Under the impulse of foreign complica
tion, which threatened us at the com
mencement of the last session of Congress,
most of ouv efficient wooden ships were put
in condition for immediate service, an»l the
repairs of onr iron-dad fleet were pushed with
the utmost vigor. The result is that most of
these now are iu an effective state ami r.eed
only to be manned and put in commission to
go at once into service. Some of the new
sloops authorized by Congress are already in
commission, and most of tbe remainder are
launched and wait only the completion of their
machinery to enable them to tuke their places
as part of our effective force.
Two iron torpedo ships hnve been com
pleted during the last year, and four of onr
large double-turreted iron-dads are now un
dergoing repairs. When these are finished
everything that is useful of our navy, as now
authorized, will be in condition for service,
and, with the advance in the science of tor
pedo warfare, the American navy, compara
tively small as it is, will be found at uuy time
powerful for the purposes of a peaceful na
tion.
Much has also been accomplished daring
the year in aid of science, and to increase th*
sum of general knowledge and further tho
interests of commerce and civilization.
Extensive and much needed soundings
have been made lor hydrographic purposes,
and to fix the proper routes of ocean tele
graphs. Further surveys of the great Isth
mus have been undertaken and completed,
and two vessels of the navy are now employed,
in conjunction with those of England, France,
Germany and Russia, in observations con
nected with the transit of Venus, so useful to
the scientific world. The estimates for this
branch of the public service do not differ ma
terially from those ot last year, those for tho
general support of the service being some
what less, and Ihose for permanent improve
ments ut the various stations rather larger
than the corresponding estimate mado a year
Dgn. The regular mainteniuce and a steady
increase in the efficiency of this most impor
tant arm, in proportion to the growth of our
maritime intercourse and interests, is recom
mended to the attention of Congress.
The use of the navy in time of peace might
bo fmther utilized by a direct authorization
of the employment of naval vessels in explo
rations and surveys ot the supposed navi
gable waters ot other nationalities on this
continent, especially the tributaries of the
two great rivers of South America, th«
( Ironoco and the Amazon. Nothing prevent«
under existing laws such exploration, except
that expenditures must be made iu such ex
peditions beyond those usually provided for
in the appropriations. The field designated
is unquestionably one ol interest and one ca
pable of large 'development of commercial
interests advantageous to the peoples reached
and to those who may establish relations with
them.
Education of the people entitled to exercise
the right of franchise I regard essential to
general prosperity every where, and especi
ally so iu republics where birth, education or
previous condition do not enter into ac
count iu giving suffrage. Next to tho publia
school, the post office is the great agent of ed
ucation over onr vast territory. The rapidity
with which new sections are being settled,
thus increasing the carrying ol mails in a*
move rapid ratio than the increase ot receipts,
is not alarming.
The report of the Postmaster Generel, here
with attached, shows that there was an in
crease of revenue iu his department in 18711
over the previous year of SI.<>74,411,and an in
crease ot cost of carrying tbe mails and pay
ing employees of $3,041,4(18 01. The report
of the Postmaster General gives interesting
statistics of his department and comparing
them with the corresponding statistics of »
year ago showing a growtti in every branch
of the department.
A postal convention has been concluded
with New South Wales, an exchange of postal
cards established with Switzerland, and the
negotiations pending lor several years post
with F mice have terminated in a convention
with that country, which went into effect last
August. „ . ,,
An International Postal < ongress wo»
convened in Berne, Switzerland, in September
last, at which the Unrated Sûtes was repre
sented by an officer of the Post Office Depart
ment of * much experience and qualification
for the position. A convention for the estab
lishment of an International Postal Union waa
agreed upon and signed by the delegates of
the countries represented, subject to the ap
proval of the proper authorities of these
countries. I respectfully direct your atten
tion to the report of the Postmaster General,
ami to his suggestions in regard to an equita
ble adjustment of tbe question of compensa
tion to railroads for carrying the mails.
Your attention will be drawn to, the un
settled condition of affairs in some of the
Southern State-;. On the 1 !th of September
last, the Governor of Louisiana called upon
me, as provided by tho Constitution and laws
of the United States, to aid id suppressing
domestic violence in that Slate. This call was
made in view of a proclamation issued on that
day by D. B. Penn, claiming tbat he was
elected Lieutenant Governor in 18i2, ana
calling upon tbe militia ot tbe Stale to arm,
assemble and drive from powi r the usurpera,
as he designated the officers ot the btato
Government. ,__..
On the next »lav I issued my proclamation
commanding the insurgents to disperse within
five days from the .late thereof, and subse
quently learned that on that day they had
token forcible possession ot the State House.
