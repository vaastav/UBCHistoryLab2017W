World. A Representative and Champion of
American Taste. <

THE ALDINE, while issued with all the regularity,
has none of the temporary or timely interest
characteristic of ordinary periodicals. It
is anelegant miscellany of pure, light, and
graceful literature; and a collection of pictures,
the rarest specimens of artiitic skill, in black
and white. Although each succeeding number
affords a fresh pleasure to its friends, the real
value and beauty of TIIE ALDINE will be
most appreciated after it has been boud up at
the. close of the year. While other publications
may claim superia cheapness, as compared with
rivals of a similar class, THE ALDINE is a

SYNOPSIS OP THE
PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
After a short recess the President's Message
at 1.40 received and read. It commences
with a recognition of the.blessings which
the American people have enjoyed within
the year past, the only exception being tho
great fire in Boston. He refers to the Go*
neva Arbitrations and its satisfactory results
which left the two Governments, American
and English without a shadow on their
friendly relations which it is sincerely hoped
may forever remain equally unclouded. It
recommends the immediate creation of a
Board of Commissioners to decide on the
amount to be paid to the individuals. It
compliments Mr. Adams and Mr. Bancroft 1
for their eminent services in the matter of 1
the txeneva ana can .Francisco ATDitrauuna,
the decision in tho latter case leaving the
United States for tho first time without any 'i
question as to disputed boundaries. 1
.In regard to the fisheries and to cur relations
with the British North American provinces,
the President says that he has received
notice that the imperial Parliament,
and the Dominican government had passed
laws to carry the provisions of the treaty of
Washington into operation, and he therefore 1
recommends legislation of Congress in the !
same direction, fie speaks of the friendly 1
relations of the United States with all the i
governments of Europe. He refers to the <
Vienna International Exposition, and xe- i
commends the fitting up of two national <
vesseis to convey the goods of exhibitors to ]
Trieste, and suggests that a proposition be i
made to have the next great Exposition in i
this country in 1876, at the time of the Cen- i
tennial Celebration in Philadelphia. He
refers to the disturbed condition of Cuba, !
and says that no advance towards pacifica- <
tion in that island has been made while the i
insurrection had gained no advantages and <
jxhibted no more of the elements of power 1
)f prospective sucoesa than a year ago; uei- t
:her had Spain succeeded in repressing the ?
insurrection. The parties to the strife were
standing in the very same attitude as they x
lave for a long time past. The condition of 1
ilayery in that island be regards as one of {
die strongest causes of the continuation of the ?
(trifo, and he thinks the abolition of slavery
rod the institution of other reforms there <
could not fail to advance the restoration of f
peace and .order. It adds greatly to the s
Popes that the present liberal government of <
Spain will voluntarily adopt that view. 1
Referring to our relations with China and t
Japan, the President recommends provisions t
for maintaining four American youths in 1
each of those countries as part of the drplomatic
family of the ministors. x
He gives details of the revenuo received 1
ta this past year the fOfflSonuB to the I
amount of over one lronclred millions of the ?
public debt. JHe. expresses a doubt whether ]
any farther reduction in taxation is practi- i
cable for the present, and he recommends <
that no more legislation be had on that sab- e
ject, except to correct.errors of omission or i
commission in the present laws, until suf- i
ficient time shall have elapsed to provo that <
it can be done and still leave sufficient reve- <
nue to meet current expenses, pay interest 1
on the public debt and provide for the Sink* i
ing Fund. He suggests also that the cur- <
rency shall be, as soon as possible, brought I
to a par with gold. <
Ho says that various enterprises will be
brought to the attention of Congress for ;
cheapening of transpoatation of produce from '
the West to the Atlantic sea coast and sug- ,
gests that steps should be taken to gain all ,
available information to obtain equitable and (
judicious legislation In this connection*, ]
he favorably refers to the proposed route to (
connect the Mississippi Valley with the Atlantic
at Charleston and Savannah by way of
the Ohio and Tennessee rivers; also' to the .
proposed extension of the James river Kanawha
Canal and the Chesapeake and Ohio
canal to the proposed ?an J from Niagara
Falls. He says that there should be almost
a continuous system of land locked navigation
from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico, nature
having provided a greater part of the
route, and the obstacles to be overcome being
within the skill of engineers.
He calls attention to tho weakness of the
American Navy and endorses the recommendation
of the Secretary of the Navy in th&t
respect; he recommends subsidies for steamship
lines to Brazil and between San Francisco,

of the salaries of "heads o Bureaus. He favors
the abolition of the frankling privileges
and rccbmmends a modification of its existing
evils. He also recommends tho-adoption
by Congres of the best method of acquiring
title to all t^jegraphic lines nowip operation,
and of connecting that service with the Postal
Service. It is not probable that the subject
can receive proper consideration at this
season, but he thinks the. movement might
be had free to the Government and the private
parties concerned.
He calls attention to the alarming falling
.? a j :?i? j
OH in ine American carrying iruuc, auu o?j?
that a yearly expenditure of five million dollars
for the next five years to restore that
trade would be a profitable investment.
Referring to the Ku Klux outrages, the
President expresses his convictions tnat the
time is not far distant when the advantages
of good order and peace will induce an abandonment
of all such combinations, and when
it will be unnecessary to carry on prosecutions,
or to inflict punishment in order to protect
citizens from the lawless doings of such combinations.
He makes suggestions in regard to the
Indians, that they shall all be confined to
the territory south of Kansas, and that farms
be secured to them in fee and in soveralty.
He recommends that a further census be
taken in 1875, but that no reapportionment
of members of Congress be made under
it.
*. In only one of the Territories, Utah, is the
condition of affairs regarded by the Presidont
as unsatisfactory. It had seemed to be the
policy of the Utah Legislature to evade all
responsibility to the Government of the Unit-,
ed States and even to hold a position hostile
to it. He recommends a caroful revisien of
the present laws and tho enactment of laws
that will secure peace, the equality of all citizens
before the law, andtheutterextinguishment
of polygamy. He recommends an appropriation
to reimburse the city of Washington
for work done in front of tho public reservations
and for the embellishment of the public
buildings and grounds. He favors action
to give greater eclat and success to the observance
of the centennial anniversary *of
American Independence.
In regard to eival service he says he will
carry out the rules during his term of office,
but suggests that there should be direct ac
* *?
tion of Congress to matte.tno system uinumg
on his successors so as to secure to the public
Berrice a practical method of obtaining faithful
and efficient officers and employees.
The reading of the message was completed
at 3:50 o'clock, 'having occupied one hour
and ten minutes.
Nitro-G-lycerine Again.
Yesterday at noon five hundred pounds of
nitro-glycerine exploded near the line of tho
New York and Boston Railroad in Yonkers,
killing George Hill, aged twenty-ono, and
Michael Gallagher, aged sixteen; mortally
Founding John Donnolly, aged nineteen, and
seriously injuring Wm. Terry, aged twenty>ne.
The New York and Boston Railroad
is to pass about three miles east of the city
)f Yonkers, and one mile west of Bronxville.
Blasting has been going on in that vicinity.
)f late, and as a great amount of this work
s necessary, nitro-glycerine has been deposited
at different points for use when wanted,
festerdav Hill, Gallagher, Donnolly and
ferrv while out punning found five cans
containing one hundred pounds each. A pit
ibout four feet deep had heen dug, and the
aura placed in the excavation. A strong
once had been built around it, and on all
iides were placards bearing the words, "Danger."
"Beware." "Nitro*Glycerine."
The boys walked around the fence comnenting
upon the improbability of danger
rom such harmless looking cans, and Hill j
>roposed that as it waa Evacuation Hay they
thould create some fun by smashing the cans. |
The others readily consented, and all four
slambered to the top of a large rock about .
ifty feet above tbe glycerine, and rolling a 1
itone weighing about fifty pounds to the j
edge of the rock. Hill and Gallagher prowsed
to tumble it into the pit. Terry said
he darned thingmight strike fire and blow
he stuff up. Hill, laughingly, said, "let
isr blow j we'll have some fun anyway."? '
rerry seized Hopnolly by tbe arm, and run- i
ring away about two hundred feet, they hid
jehind a large .tree, at the sametime jeered J
itone down. It struck the cans, and the cx)bsion
which followed was heard and felt |
or ten miles arourfd. Trees, stones, and
even great chunks of earth were hurled in
every direction. The rock where stood Hill
ind Gallagher, weighing hundreds of tons,

orn up hundreds of feet around. A firstdoss
earthquake could not create greater
jovoc.' Every pane of glass for miles was
shattered, and the inmates terrified. The
ixplosion was heard iu White Plains, Tarryawn,
Tremont, Washington Heights, and
even over in New Jersey.
Workmen from the railroad hurried to the
scene, well knowing what had happenod.?
They found Terry and Donnolly ffith their
slothing stripped from their bgdies, lying
ibout two hundred feet from the scene of the
explosion, groaning in agony. Donnolly's
body was badly lacerated. His legs and one
arm were broken, his body was black and
blue, and one eye was gone. He was mortally
wounded. Terry was the least hurt,
and will probably recover. . He is the only
one left to give an account of the affair.
When the smoke had cleared away search
was made for Hill and Gallagher. Hill's
body was blown to atoms. His entrails were
suspended from the limb of a tree five hundred
feet away. Other parts of the body were
scattered for hundreds of feet around. Only
a small part of his remains, however, had
been found last night. Gallagher's body was
not blown into so many particles as Hill's.
His legs were found severed froin the body,
which was perfectly nude. Even his boots
had been torn to shreds and scattered among
the drfons. The body, minus the arms and
head, lay about fifty feet from the legs. The
scalp and face without the skull, were found
in another place. The arms were shattered
and only portions were found. The skull is
is still, missing.
Capt. Mangin, of the Yonkers police, was
soon on the spot and took charge of the
wounded men. They were taken to Saint
John's Riverside Hospital. Donnolly is insensible
and will not recover. Terry was too
badly hurt to give a full and detailed account
of the explosion last night. Coroner Smith arrived
in the afternoon from Hastings, and
began preparations for holding the inquests.
Hill's remains?all that can be found?will
be viewed this morning by the coroner's jury.
The excitement in Yonkers, and in fact
throughout the entire neighborhood, was
terrific. All sorts of conjectures were advanced
as to the explosion. Some insisted

others thought there had beeu au earthquake!
The superstitious fell on their knees
in prayer. The irreverent trombled .with
fear, but everybody anxiously inquired what
the matter was One old lady in the Suburbs
of Bronxville was in her yard when a piece
of the fence with the word "Danger" fell at
her feet, and she fainted on the spot.
All four of the boys lived on what is called
Hog Hill, Within the city limits of Yonkers.
Hi.l resided with his parents, and
Gallagher boarded with his aunt. They were
of the poorer class and worked at odd jobs in
Yonkers.?iV. Y. Sun.

by whiph those wonders of modern imitative
art, ptwularly known as Chromos, are gradually
dewloped, step by step, to a perfection
whid^fimost defies discrimination in comparing
Vtith the original. The lithographic,
or sMm process, is that generally used in
this ^l&mtry; but having been feund too
slow, and inherently defective for renderings
sonic of the most delicate tints, great effort
has beenjmade to find a substitute, by which
a higher ^degree of perfection could be attained,
and&he superior productive capacity, of

had adopted his process for the production of '
fchoir Prfemium Ohromos, some three years
ago; and, with the increased facilities thus
placed a^his disposal, Mr. Stahl has been enabled
to achieve the most admirable results, (

The pQRpre to he copied is covered with ,
a transparent sheet of oiled paper, on which ^

Gen Lee's Room.?The Nashville Union
and American says: A gentleman residing
in this city, and who returned from the
Washington and Lee University, of Virginia,
relates some pleasant facts connected with
the last days of Gen. Lee. He says that the
private room in which the General occupied
has been left just as it was whep he went
out of it on tho morning he took to his bed,
and from which hO never arosa. The General
went into his room at the usual hour
shat morning, put on hisslippcrs, took a seat
near a window, from which he drew the
curtain partially back, and began reading a
copy of thb Nashville Union and American.
He had been complaining of feeling unwell,
and after reading a short time he laid the
paper on' the table and left the room, never
more to return. To-day the visitor'to the
University is shown the room which he is allowed
to enter, but is prohibited from touching
anything. On the dust covered table he
sees the paper as it dropped from the hand
of the great chieftain, and near the chair,
which is partly turned around^, his slippers.
The curtain is in the same positien in which
the General had placed it, and in the inkstand
is the deeply corroded pen, just as it
had been left when last used. A guard is
mounted at the door every day to sec th^t
nothing about the room is distured by any
one visiting if.
How a President is Elected.?Each
State is entitled to as many electors of President
and Vice-President as it has Senators
and Representatives in Congress.
In each State the electors are chosen by a
nlurnlitvvote. That is. if three sets of elect
ore be voted for, tho sets having the highest
"number of votes is chosen.
But a candidate for President, in order to
be successful, must have a majority of all the
electors. Tho electoral colleges, as now constituted,
consists of 317?159, therefore, are
necessary for a choice.
-If there are three candidates for President,
and neither of them receives a majority
of the electoral college, then there is no
choice, and the election goes to the House
of Representatives.
The House must conSno their choice to the
three highest candidates voted fbr by the
electors. Toe Kepresentatives vote by States,
and etfch State has but one vote: SO that the
power of Delaware is aa great as tlrai of New
York; The majority oftho State delegation

like the appearance of the ToWer of B&bel. v
All languages, even Hebrew, were spoken.
A crowd of friends of the three sexes?mascuKne,
feminine, and begging?in qnfest of
something filled the offioe all day long. One j(
met'there even dealers in precious stones,
who spread before the Baron's .eyes their
caskets of jewels; even dealers in old curiosi-- 4
ties and pictures, who came to offer their rarest J
treasures; even pretty women, who wriggled J
in everywhere, coming to ask for informa- tion
or for something else. And amid ?dl t
this pitiless yid incessant throng, while- the {
brain of the great banker, always at work, j
was in danger of bursting under the acoumu- \
lation of figures and the battle of calculations,

cheeked child) sometimes camegallopping ?
in on his father's canc and blowing on a 1
trumpet like the angel of the Yalley of 0
Jehosophat. J

bowed, and giving my voice all the humility !
compatiable with my offended dignity, I replied
: "A great many people probably have 1
formed that same opinion of me, but this is f
the first time anybody has taken it into his
head to tell me so." "The Baron" made no ?
answer. One day Manuel, the well-known <

his hat on his head and replied: "You are t
right; it is nothing to me. You might die {
and be d?d to you just where you are, with- c
