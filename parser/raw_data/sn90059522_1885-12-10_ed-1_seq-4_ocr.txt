THE PRICES.
There was an expectation on the part of a
large number of those who deal on the stock
board that tho death of Mr. Vanderbilt
would produce a disturbance in stocks. Those
who were carrying heavy loads on limited
margins were very nervous Indeed, and were
relieved when they found there were a plenty
of orders in to buy the Vanderbilt's. The
market was without any special feature and
the sales were large. Wheat was a shade
lower.

THE NEW BULKS.
Now that congress has completed its or
ganization, with the exception of appoint
ing the regular committees, and the presi- j
dent has recommended to its consideration i
subjects sufficient to keep that body busy
lor the next six months, there is nothing
left but to get right down to work and to
stick at it until all the work is completed. '
This is the first time for twenty-live years i
that the house of representatives has been j
in political accord with the ex- j
ecutive department, and consequently
the Democrats have a heavier re
sponsibility resting upon them than
they have had for a quarter of a century.
Under these circumstances it is to be ex
pected that the Democrats in congress will
feel their way cautiously. They should
adopt the Davy Crockett motto: "First
be sure that they are right and then go
ahead." The first and perhaps most diffi
cult matter they will have to encounter
will be the proposition to change the house
rules. This proposition is becoming a mat
ter of more serious import than was at first
supposed. At the first blush the idea
which was prominent in its favor, of being
a measure to expedite legislation, com
mended itself so thoroughly to the country
that there seemed to be a unan
imous public sentiment in its fa
vor. Since, however, Mr. Rax
d all has explained how easy it would be to
organize raids on the public treasury under
operation of the proposed new rule there
has been a change in sentiment. The
Democratic party came into power because
of its promise to retrench the expenses of
tlie government. There is no man in con
gress who has done more to cut down ex
penses and has made a more persistent fight
against, extravagance than Mr. Randall.
Consequently whenever he has anything to
say on this subject his words are listened to.
Before taking action on the proposed change
in the rules, it will be necessary for the Demo
crats of the house to get together in caucus
and to agree upon the course they are to
pursue. If, after a full discussion of the
whole matter among themselves, a major
ity of the Democratic members agree to the
change it will be made. If Mr. Randall
can convince them that his views are cor
rect then the change will not be made.
There is no necessity for bad feeling in the
matter, nor is there occasion for quarreling
over it. It is a matter which affects the
public more than it does any Individual
member of congress. It should be dis
cussed and decided solely upou its bearing
on the public welfare.
THE TARIFF DISCUSSION".
There is no part of the president's mes
sage which will receive more general com
mendation than his brief but conservative
discussion of the tariff. In his views he
follows directly in the line of the national
Democratic platform. He favors a reduc
tion to a revenue basis, and at the same
time opposes any radical change which re
sults disastrously to any important interest
that has been built up under the prevailing
system. As he says, the question of free
trade and protection do not neces
sarily enter into any readjustment
that congress will now be called
upon to make. The thing of prime import
ance is to relieve the people of the burthen
of unnecessary taxation. He recognizes the
fact that revenues for the legitimate ex
penses of the government are to be raised
by tariff duties. If we have industries
which need protection, let the tariff which
is designed for revenue purposes be ad
justed so as to protect them, provided it
does not impose a hardship upon the people.
The one simple principle of holding the in
terests of the people first Li view and
making the protection of industries a sec
ondary is all that is needed
in an application to a correct tariff reform.
The protectionists must be very foolish to
attempt to obstruct legislation in this
direction. By doing so they will only pro
voke the people into making more sweeping
reductions than would be safe for their in
terests. As an evidence that this fact is
being realized by the manufacturers, Col.
Alkxandek McCltjrk, editor of the Phil
adelphia Times, writes to his paper from
Washington urging the Pennsylvania iron
men to fall in with the tariff reform move
ment as their salvation depends an it. Col.
McClure sees the handwriting on the wall
and he very frankly tells the Pennsylvania
manufacturers that they must either go
with the tide and protect their
interests by giving direction to its course
or be submerged by it if they are foolish
enough to attempt to obstruct it. It
is understood that Mr. Randall has
the same belief. In fact there is something
so suggestive of Mr. Raxdai.l's style of
writing in that part of the president's
message which relates to the tariff as to
excite suspicion that during the recent pri
vate conference between the distinguished
Pennsylvaniau and the president the latter
was benefited by some hints which Mr.
Randall dropped. It makes no differ
ence, however, where the ideas came from,
they are sound and acceptable.
THE BREAKERS AHEAD.
As Mr. Vaxdkkbilt had to die it was
nrnvidential for the country that his death
was unexpected. A lingering illness would
have started the bulls and the bears to work
on the market, and in their mad specula
tion schemes there is no telling what finan
cial disasters would have followed. As it
is. yesterday in "Wall street demonstrated
that notwithstanding the excitement which
followed the sudden death of Mr. Vaxder-
hilt there was no serious disturbance in
the market. A depression occurred at the
Opening of the market, but it proved to be
only temporary* and the market closed
firm. The sudden death of Jay Goi t ld
would have produced more com
motion than Mr. Vaxdf.rbii.t's death.
Goiri.n has not the wealth which Vaxder
nn.T possessed, but he was more of a spec
ulator and carried more irons in the fire at
one time. It will be fortunate if Mr.
Gould will retire permanently from Wall
street. The death of Vaxderbilt will
probably have the effect of confirming him
in his present purpose to do so. It would
be still better if our conditions were such
that no one man could attain so much
power in business and financial circles as
Gould and Vaxdekbilt have enjoyed.
The accumulation of such vast fortunes are
the breakers upon which our American in
stitutions will yet be wrecked.
THE MOKMOX TROUBLES.
The Mormons deny that there is any
danger of an outbreak at Salt Lake City.
They were not expected to make confession
even if the rumors had been true. Conse
quently their denial will not cause the gov
ernment to relax vigilance or to withdraw
the troops until more satisfactory evidence
of peacable intentions on their part is ob
tained. And while the government is keep
ins a close eye on the Mormon and is using
every effort to suppress polygamy, it might
hs well keep au eye on some of the govern
ment officials in Utah, who, if rumors be
true, are guilty of grosser immoralities than
(ho Mormons are. Some of them who
THE ST. PAUL DAILY GLOBE. THURSDAY MORNING, DECEMBEB 10, 1885. —TEN PAGES.
were suspected of immoral practices were
shadowed by Mormon spies and caught in
the act. When brought before the munici
pal court in Salt Lake for trial the federal
court intervened its power and released the
guilty oniekiN such conduct on the part
of the federa' '«art and government offi
cers is inn -.\1 calculated to inspire the
Mormon uiin I vith the sincerity of Gentile
professions ol virtue. Nor does it place
the government in a very consistent light.
The president .should at once order the re
tirement of the officials who have disgraced
the government in this matter and fill their
places with men whose walk in life will ex
emplify what the government is preaching
to the Mormons.
THE DEAD CHINAMA\.
"Only a dead Chinaman." Such was
the remark made by a half-dozen people
who were curious enough to look in upon
the dead laundryman, whose stiffened form
lay on a trunk in his den on Fourth street
yesterday. Beyond the fact that he was
the first Celestial to die in St. Paul there
was no comment on the death of the
friendless laundryman. And yet the life
of the young man had been invested with a
touch of romance and a tender pathos of
unusual interest. There was the old, old
story of fruitless love, accompanied by a
father's maledictions for looking with favor
upon a lass below his station, then
followed by exile from his home
and from his native land. Anil
then the sequel of the father's ruined for
tune and death, and the penniless boy
working day and night to lay by a pittance
to send back to an aged mother who was
dependent on his labor. "Only a dead
Chinaman." And yet if we could have ex
plored the strange, mysterious depths of
that poor Chinaman's heart what tongue
could tell the hidden riches which were
stored there. In that riven heart were
memories of a tender passion and the image
of a maiden face which only disappeared
when the last spark of life had fled. lie
was only a heathen Chinee. And yet in
his nature was a touch of filial piety
which would have done honor to a
saint. "lie saved his earnings to send to his
mother." Such was the testimony of Sam
Waft, his countryman, to a Globe reporter.
It is a simple story and yet the friendless
laundryman has left behind him a nobler
record than the dead millionaire, who lies
in his jewelled casket to-day. An Wing was
more of a benefactor than Vanderbilt.
lie was more serviceable to humanity, and
the lessons of his humble lite are a more
precious legacy to mankind than any that
can be drawn from the career of our dead
Croesus. From his hundreds of millions
Vanderbilt contributed a few thousand
to public charities. Ah Wing's contribu
tion to the support of an infirm mother was
only a mite, but it was his all. It repre
sented just so many days and weeks and
years of incessant toil.
PRESIDENTIAL PROLIXITY".
In the Globe's interviews with people of
St. Paul in an endeavor to obtain public
opinion of the president's message it is
singular to observe how many of them had
not read it. And yet it is not a fact excep
tional to St. Paul that comparatively few
people read these state papers. It is so
everywhere. People are too busy to take
time to wade through eighteen or twenty
columns of closely printed matter to obtain
the views of one man concerning public
questions, even though that man be the
chief magistrate of the nation. They prefer
to do. just as a prominent business man in
this city says he did, wait to see the editor
ial comments of the newspapers, believing
that they would give as correct conclusions
as could be drawn from their own read
ing. In this busy age people have not
time to do what they pay other people to
do for them. Prolixity is an unfortunate
weakness with American statesmen. Our
presidents could very well afford to take
Queen Victoria as a model in delivering
state addresses. When the presidents get
their inaugurals and annual messages
whittled down to the length of the queen's
special on the opening of parliament
they will be more generally read. Just
imagine the effect it would have have upon
the country if Mr. Evarts should ever be
so unfortunate as to be elected president
The entire American people would have
to take a vacation the three weeks he
would be delivering his inaugural.
NEWSPAPER IXDEPEXDENCE.
While President Cleveland is a success
as a reformer he is also occasionally a good
subject for reform. An illustration of this
was found in the president's attempt to
snub Editor Pulitzer some time ago be
cause the World had the independence to
criticize the administration whenever it
thought criticism was just. But it is grati
fying to observe that the president can
practice what he preaches, for while he is
making herculean efforts to reform the
civil service he, himself, tumbles to
the reform influence whenever it
comes his way. When the presi
dent learned that an executive
snubbing did not decrease the circulation
nor diminish the influence of a great news
paper, he promptly made atonement for
his mistake. When Mr. Pulitzer went
to Washington to take his seat in congress
he was the first man the president hunted
out from among all the celebrities who
gather at the national capital at this sea
son, and the next thing we heard of was
that the lately snubbed. editor was dining at
the White house. Having thus made pub
lic confession of his error the president is
entitled to absolution. But the moral of it
all is that the newspaper editor who follows
strictly in the line of conscientious duty,
without regard to the favor or magnates, is
a greater man than the president of the
United States .
SCHOOL WORK.
The Globe publishes this morning a re
view of the school work in this city for the
year 1885. This summary shows a most
satisfactory condition of our educational
interests. The increase in attendance kept
pace with the increase of population, while
the increase in school facilities has been as
rapid as it was possible to provide for the
rapidly growing demand. The school offi
cers have a good deal of work yet to accom
plish in extending facilities for accommo
dating the increased attendance, but the
work is being pushed with commendable
vigor. Supt. Wright's testimony is that
the experiment of a training school is prov
ing a most satisfactory success, and will be
made a valuable feature in promoting the
efficiency of our school system.
THE RYAN OPENING.
The formal opening of the Hotel Ryan
was attended with ceremonies proportionate
to the importance of the occasion. The
full details of the interesting event appear
in this morning's Globe. The Ryan is an
institution of which our people have a right
to be proud, and they showed an apprecia
tion of the fact by the magnificent display
of last evening. The Ryan is pronounced
by connoiseura to be the model hotel of the
continent. It is a mouument of the enter
prise of St. Paul's people, and as such we
are proud of it.
REOPENED.
The Globe is in receipt of some more in
teresting communications' respecting the
late tax-title decision. But as the supreme
court has granted a rehearing of the case all
further discussion of the subject will have
to be made in open court. It is gratifying
to know that there is at least a suspension
of judgment in this case, and an opportunity
will be presented to the public to be heard
in a case which is of such vital importance
to their interests.

Crushed in a Sewer.
Akhon, 0., Dec. 9. — Late this afternoon
a sewer in process of construction caved in,
burying seven laborers, four of whom were
crushed to death and the three others in
jured so badly that they will probably die.
The cave occurred without a moment's
warning. Tho ground, which had been
frozen for two or three days, was softened
by a thaw. Three of the men were staud-
ing on a scaffolding and the four others at
the bottom of the sewer, which had been
excavated to the depth of twenty-two feet.
Suddenly the timbers began cracking, and
the water-soaked earth, for a distance of
twenty feet on each side of the sewer,
rolled down upon the workmen. William
McGill, one of the men on the scaffold, es
caped, but all the others were caught by
the mass of timbers. A great crowd of
people soon assembled. The groans of the
men who were but partially buried, were
heart-rending. They called for assistance,
but for some time no oue would venture
near the hole. Finally a large force of men
was set to work with shovels, and In half
an hour two of the victims were taken out.
They were yet alive, but in terrible agony.
Another hour of digging brought them to
a third man, whose groans had guided the
rescuing nartv. Near him was found the
body of a fourth man, dead, it being appar
ent at that time that the others were dead,
the search was abandoned for the night.
The list of killed and wounded is as fol
lows:
MAX ROSENWEG, age 27, single, dead.
HENRY FRIGERT, dead.
Two unknown Italians, dead.
JOHN WYKOFF, married, chest and abdo
men crushed and leg- broken: will die.
HENRI' WALTER, age 35, married; legs
crushed and scalp whund; may recover.

fatally injured.
Work of Natural Gas.
Canonsburg, Pa., Dec. 9. — This morn
ing at 4 o'clock an explosion of natural gas
occurred at the residence of Westly Greer
on Main street, wrecking the building and
hurling the occupants from their beii.-t into |
the lot surrounding the house, thirty fees
away. The force of the concussion was se
terrific that the roof was lifted from the j
house and carried a hundred yards. The I
sides of the building bulged out and then fell,
immediately after the fragments of the
structure took tire and in less than an hour
the whole was in ashes. Mr. Greer, his
wife and two children, a babe and a boy of
4 years old, were sleeping soundly at the
time. They were lifted with the flying
debris, bed and all. and landed in the yard.
None of them were fatally injured. Mr.
Greer's hair and mustache were singed and
his back severely injured. Mrs. Greer was
burned about the head and hands and her
hair burned off. The baby miraculously
escaped injury. It was securely wrapped
up in bed and its clothing, it is supposed,
saved its life. The four-year-old boy was
less fortunate and pretty badly burned
about the body. The report of the explo
sion was heard for miles and aroused the
citizens, who quickly came to the relief of
the ,Greer family and conveyed them to 'a
place of safety. The dwelling and contents
are a total loss.

A CITY IN THE DARK.
A Gas Explosion Leaves Kansas City
Without Light.
Kansas Citt, Dec. 9.— The gas explo
sion here this morning loft, the city with an
Inadequate supply of lighting materials.
The demand for lamps exhausted the stocks
of the dealers in the city, and new supplies
were ordered by telegraph, except where
the electric light is used. The only resort
is the coal-oiJ lamp or the tallow dip, and
the city streets this evening present an ap
pearance as strange as it is gloomy. Orders
for electric lights poured in from merchants
and others much faster than they could be
tilled. The theaters and hotels have made
provisional arrangements for illumination j
and there will be no more serious results
than the inconvenience for the time from the
cessation of the gas supply. Unusual
police precautions will be taken
for the protection of life and property of
the darkened streets and about the house
until the debris is cleared. At the scene of
the explosion the extent of the damage
cannot be definitely ascertained and the
requisite time for rebuilding determined.
The gas company had trouble with some
twenty striking emnloves several weeks
ago. and it is said that threats have been
made against -their property.
BUZZING OF A BEE.
G«r, Gray of Indiana Said to Desire
a Seuatorsliip.
Special to the Globe.
Indianapolis. Ind.. Dec. 9. — Gov.
Gray left last evening for Washington,
ostensibly, so it is said, for the executive
department, to secure from the general
government an acknowledgment of the
claim of the state to several thousand acres
of land, which field notes of the swamp land
survey describe as being wet, but for
which the state has never received any
potent. He is said to be confident of suc
ceeding in his mission. It is common be
lief, however, in political circles, that the
governor's trip had an entirely different
purpose. He is active as ever in pursuit of
the nomination for United States senator in
1887, and the death of vice president
Hendricks, who, with Senator Voorhees,
was backing Grey in the race against the
McDonald-English combination, makes it
necessary for him to secure the, aid of some
other staunch and influential friend
at the seat of government. It
is believed he will endeavor
to enlist in this service Congressman Hol
man, who, despite his many objectionable
qualities, is yet a man of great influence in
the state. It is asserted that Grey is re
sponsible for the talk of making Justice
Niblock. chief of the supreme court, the
leader of the Indiana Democracy, now that
Hendricks is gone, to defeat, if possible.
W. H. English's aspirations for honor. If
the latter cannot be killed off in some way
the governor's chances for the senatorship
will be seriously threatened. If he suc
ceeds in laying out English, however, it is
conceded he will win the senatorial nomi
nation hands down.
New St. Paul Depot.
Special to the Globe.
Milwaukee, Dec. 9.— Although work
on the new St. Paul depot on Clybourne
street lias been suspended for the winter,
labor on the new bridge across the
Menominee will be continued and
such progress made as the weather
will permit, It was rumored some time
ago that the St. Paul management would
dispose of its union depot to the Wisconsin
Central. It is now semi-officially
stated that the old depot will be used
as a freight office and the yard
used entirely for freight. The increasing
freight business of the company is
said to render it absolutely neces
sary that they have better
facilities for handling increasing freight,
The need for more warehouse room i<* also
felt. This want will probably be met in
the spring by the erection of two new ware
houses, which will probably be built on the
south side, in the vicinity of the present de
pot.
Unlawful Deer Killinc
Special to the Globe.
Eau Claike. Wis., Dec. 9.— The snow
fall of yesterday is just the right depth to
afford capital hunting for deer in the for
ests of this vicinity. The arrivals were
never known so plentiful as this season,
but the absence of snow prevented the nu
merous huntsmen from making their sport
a success. The law for the prevention of
deer slaughter in this region expired only a
few days ago, but many hunters who make
this their business have remained in
the forests waiting for snow. Regardless
of law and in defiance of the wishes of
those who desire to preserve the game out
of season, these hunters are wilfully killing
animals and disposing of the saddles, leav
ing the rei.iainder of the carcass to rot on
the ground. Their movements are now be
ing closely watched by interested parties
and hereafter arrest and punishment will
follow those engaged in the fascinating,
but unlawful, sport.
A Methodist Congrreg-ationaliiit.
Special to the Globe.
Oshkosh, Wis., Deo. 9. — It has been
made public to-day that the committee
from the First Congregational church, ap
pointed to supply the vacancy in the pulpit,
lias received information which assures it
that Rev. Henry Faville, the present pas
tor of the Algoina Methodist church
of this city, may be considered a
candidate for the position and will no
doubt be installed as its pastor. Mr. Fa
ville states that he is willing to leave the
ranks of the Methodist church not because
he believes that the work in that denomina
tion is a failure, but because he was brought
up when a boy in the faith of a Congrega
tionalist. His appointment would please
the members of the Congregational society.
Oliio Senatorial Cases.
Columbus, 0., Dec. 9. — In the supreme i
court to-day the argument in the Cincinnati
senatorial cases was concluded. The ques
tion as to the representatives of that
county will be submitted on the same argu
ment, although the bill of exceptions to the
Hamilton circuit court have not been signed
and fonnaily filed in the supreme court. The
mandamus proceedings in which the gov
ernor and secretary of state seek to compel i
Clerk Dalton of the Hamilton county court
to make return of Abstract No. 9, which j
will determine the vote of that county on j
state offices, was also argued later in the j
the day. and submitted in reply and demur- j
rer. It will be passed upon by the court at
the same time as the other cases.
Murderer CaujrUt.
Skdalia, Mo., Dec. 9. — Ten years ago
a trivial quarrel was the cause \^ich led to I
the murder of Thomas Hewitt, alleged by \
his brother Richard. The murderer es
caped and no trace was found un
til a week ago, when Sheriff Mur
ray was notitied that he was
living near Versailles, Morgan county.!

Pettis county jail. The evidence is very
strong against the- prisoner, and it is
thought he will be convicted.

liemarkably Close.
LoWDOtf, Dec. 9. — .Seven parliamentary
seats remain ti) be declared. Tlie Liberals
count upon obtaining three of these seats,
which would raise their total to 334, against
336 Conservatives and Nationalists. A re
port, which is believed in the Liberal
clubs, is current to the effect that Gladstone
had decided to seize the first chance to oust
the Conservatives. He is said to be
eager for ollice, proposing to conclude his
public life with the production
of a home-rule measure for
Ireland. Mr. Bradlaugh has entered into
negotiations with the Liberal leaders. Ho
proposed not to present himself at the bar
of the house of commons to take the oath
of office at the opening of
parliament, provided the Liberals
will introduce and support a bill allowing
the members elect to affirm instead of tak
ii the oath. The number of members of
the new house of commons never befora
elected to parliament is 332. This has had
no parallel since the first parliament
under the reform bill in iS3ii.
Mr. F. A. Charrnay. l.ihpral
who has been elected in Northamptonshire,
was born in America and is a grand nephew
of Rev. William Ellery Channin::. The
Daily Xews anticipates that the Liberals
wdt await the declaration of Lord Salis
bury's program before taking any action.
In Battle Array.
London, Dec. 9.— The number of Servi
ans encamped at Nissa exceeds 100,000.
They are weL armed. Col. Horratovitch,
the commander, is vigorously arrang
ing defenses. Turkish volunteers
are arriving at Rustchuk daily,
singing the war song "Hail Bulgaria."
They will form separate battaions.. The
Bulgarian war preparations continue una
bated. A dispatch from Philippopolissays:
In an interview to-d.iy Mihadi
Pasha, the Turkish commissioner,
who is returning from Constantinople,
said that the cordial relations between Tur-
key and Bulgaria could be easily arranged
if Russia's objection to Prince Alexander
could be overcome, adding that the Bul
garians are willing to sacrifice everything
for a union with Roumelia.
Be Conrcy Recalled.
Paris, Dec. 9.— Gen. De Courcy has
been recalled from Armani, Gen. Xegrier
succeeds in command of the French troops.
Gen. De Courcy is accused of having, in his
official reports, magnified the difficulty ot
the situation in Annam and of imprudently
meddling with the Annamite authorities,
thereby exciting the natives to the verge of
a general revolt.
The Coming- Storm,
Washington, Dec. 9.— The committee
appointed by the Republicans last session
to decide upon the action that the Repub
lican majority should take in regard to con
firmations will probably make their report
to-morrow. It consists of Edmonds, Alli
son, Hale, Spooner vnd Harrison. Allison
favors the confirmations in all cases where
no good reason can be found for objecting.
Edmunds believes in drawing the line upon
the ten ure-of -office act, and is refusinz to
confirm any Democrat whose Republican
predecessor had not served out his term.
Where removals have been made for offen
sive partisanship, he would rigidly in
vestigate the new incumbent's political
record, and, if it should be proven that a
Republican partisan was succeeded by a
Democratic partisan, he would object to the
latter's confirmation. It is understood thai
the rest of the committee, with the excep
tion of Allison, take the same view. The
rumor of last summer that Sen
ator Logan would oppose the
confirmation of Postmaster Judd oi
Chicago is again afloat. Logan is said to
have numerous extracts from the Chicago
Tribune files of 1S(51 going to show that
Mr. Judd was a member of the organization
known as the Sons of Liberty during thai
period. Ex-Postmaster Palmer of Chicago
was in the city to-day in consultation with
Gen. Logan.
