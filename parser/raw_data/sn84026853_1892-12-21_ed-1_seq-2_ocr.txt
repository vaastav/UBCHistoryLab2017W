To the Senate and House of Representatives: j
In submitting my annual message to Congress
I have great satisfaction in being able
to say that the general conditions affecting
the commercial and industrial interests of I
the United States are In the highest degree j
favorable. A comparison of the existing t
conditions with those of the most favored (j
period in the history of the country will, I r
believe, show that so high a degree of pros- l
parity and so general a diffusion of the com- 8
forts of life were never before enjoyvi toy j
oar people. r
The total wealth of the country fax 1S60 <]
was $16,159,616,06s. in 1890 amounted to c
162,010,000,000, an increase uf287 per cent c
Tue total mileage of railways in the 1
United States in I860 was 30,626; in 1893 it
was iof,i4i, an increase ot 440 per cenu; 0
and it is estimated that there will be about t
4000 miles of track added by the close of the a
year 1892. 6
CENSUS FIGURE*. . t
The official returns of the Eleventh Cen- 1
ens and those of the Tenth Census for 75 r
leading cities furnish the basis for the fol- ?
lowing comparisons: , t
In 1880 the capital invested in manufac- *
tor ins: was $1,232,839,670.
In 1890 the capital invested in manufac- a
turi ng was $2,9'JO, 735,884. 1
In 1880 the number of employes was c
1,301,388. \
In 1890 the number ot employes was c
2,251,134. t
In 1880 tHe wages earnel ware $501,965,- s
778. y
In 1893 the wages earned wore $1,221,170,- t

1 In 1880 the value of the product was $2,- 0
711,579,899. c
In 1890 the value of the product was $4,- *
fWf>28ASH7. S
1 am informed by the Superintendent of
the Census that the omission of certain in- s
d us tries in 1830, which were included in '
1890, accounts in part for the remarkable ?
increase thus shown. But, after making t
toll allowance for differences of method ana p
deducting the returns for aft interests not p
included in the Census of 1880, there remain t
in the reports from these seventy-five cities t
an increase in the capital employed of a
$1,522,745,604; in the value of the product a
of *2,124.236,166; in wace6 earned of 1677,- a
943,929, and in the number of wage-earners n
employed of 856,029. The wage-earnings
not only show an increased azcregate, but b
an increase per capita from |3S6 in 1880 to g
1547 in 189) or 41.71 psr cent. n
The new industrial plants established since f<
October 6, 1890, and up to October 22, 189?, d
as partially reported in the American Econo- n
mist, number 345, and the extension of ex- a
feting plants, 108; the new capital invested r
amounts to 140,449,050, and tne number of &
additional employes to 37,285. t
The Textile World, for July, 1892, states n
that during the first six months of the pres
ent calendar year 135 new factories were tl
built, of which 40 are cotton mills, 48 knit- e
tine: mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk mills,
4 plash mills and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 fr
cotton mills 21 have been built in the South- to
era States. Mr. A. B. Shep person, of the New p
Tork Cotton Exchange, estimates the nam- b
bear of working spindles in the United 1<
States on Ssptember 1, 1892, at 15,200,000, v
an increase of 660.000 over the year 1831. a
The consumption of cotton by American tl
mill* in 1391 was 2,393,000 bales, and in 1892 ii
2,584,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales, v
From the year 1889 to 1892, inclusive, tl
there has been an increase in the consump- w
tion of cotton in Europe of 92 per cant., o
while during the same period the increased o
consumption in the United States has been ei
about 150 per cent. , t<
The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of fl
the Treasury Department, shows that at the tl
date of September 80, 1892, there were a
thirty-two companies manufacturing tin
and terne plate in toe unitea o?wa nuu i<
fourteen companies building new works for *
neb manufacture. The estimated invest' p
ment in building and plants at the close of it
tbe flcal year, June 39, 1893, if existing con- ti
ditions were to be continued, was f5,000,000, J
and tbe estimated rate of production 200, - o
600,000 pounds per annum. The actual pro(taction
for tbe quarter ending September p
80, 1892, was 10,9)2,725 pounds. r
The report of Labor Commissioner Peck, tl
of New York, shows that during the year e:
1891, in about six thousaud manufacturing ii
establishments in that State embraced p
within the special inquiry made by him, and - n
representing 67 different industries, there v
was a net increase over the year 1890 of e
|S1,315,130.63 in the valuo of the product,
and of <6.377,925.09 in the amount of wages
paid. The report of the commissioner of
labor for the State of Massachusetts shows t:
that 3745 industries in <bat State paid c
8129,416,248 in wa?es during the year 1891, e
gainst *126,03.),3J3 in 1S9J, an increase of ?
83,335,945, and that there was an increase t
of 19,932,490 in the amount of capital and of ~
7346 in the number o? persons employed in b
tbe same period. 8
During the last six months of the year v
1891 and the first six months of 1892 the to- u
tal production of pig iron was 9,710,819 tons, 11

which was the largest annual production
ever attained. For the same twelve months
ol 1891-92 the production of Bessemer ingots
was 3,878,5S1 tons, an increase of 189,710
gross tons over the previous unprecedented
early production of 3,688,871 gross tone in
1890. Tho productian of Bessemer steel
rails for the first six months of 1893 was
772,436 gross tons, as against 702,0 50 gross
tons during the last six months of tae year
1891.
EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.
The total value of our fbreign trade (exports
and imports of merchandise) during
the last fiscal year was SI,857,(583,610 an increase
of $128,283,604 over the previous fiscal
year.
The value of our exports during the fiscal
year 1892 reached the highest figure in the
history of the Government, amounting to
$1,030,"278,148, exceeding by $14?,797,33S the
exports of 1891 anil exceeding the value of
the imports by $202,873,683.
U'JASIWISfc AAU intunau maui,.
In our coastwise trade a mo3t encouraging
development is in progress, there bavins:
been in the last four years an increasa of 16
per cent. In internal commerce the statistics
?how that no such period oi prosperity has
ever before existed. The freight cirried in
the coastwise trade o the Ore it L ikas in
1890 aggregate 28,293,959 ton-. On tie
Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio Rivers an 1 J
tributaries in the same year the traffic a~- J
gregate.-i :i9,40o,04fi tons, and the total ves- J
tel tonDage passing through the Detroit :
River during that year was 21,6 >4,000 tons. J
The vessel tonnage entered an i cleared in (
the foreign trade of Lmiou during 1S^) '
amounted to 13,480,767 tons, and OtLivarpool
1",941,800 tons, a total for thesa two 1

*? ? nt Mi* iTBn?rA.l nro?- ,
AHUl/Uri IUUIVO.... r
perity of tbe country is found in the fact J ]
that the number of depositors in saviujs
banks increased from 693,870 in IS6J to 4,- (
258,898 in 1890, an increas? of 518 par coat, i
and the amount of deposits from $149,277,- ,
504 in 186.) to $1,524,844,5 x> in I89J, an in- i(
crease of 921 per caat. lu l?9l tiw amount
of deposits in savings banks w $1.623,07J,749.
It is estimated that 90 p?r cent, of
these deposits represent the savings of wage- j 1
earners. Tho bank clearance* for nine 1
months ending Septe-nber 30,18'Jl, amounted
to 141,049,390,808.* For the same months in
1892 they amounted to $15,189,(501,947, an ex- I
cess for the nine months of $4.149,211,139. ;
v-i^-e has never been a time ia our his- <
tory when work was so abundant or when
wanes were as high, whether measured by
the currency in which t^ey are paid or by
their power to supply the necassaries and
comforts of life. It is true that the market
nrifPK of cotton and wheat have .been low.
It is one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture
tliat the farmer cannot produce
upon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance
of the agsre^ate production of the
year, and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation
which follows overproduction.
VALUE OF FARM PRODUCTS.
The value of our total farm proluct? has
increaspil from $1.363,64li,St}!5 in 1360 to $4,500,000,000
in 1S91, as estimated by statisticians,
an increase oE 230 nor cent. The
number of boss January 1. 1S91, was50,625,106
and their value $210,193,925; on January
I, 189?, the number was 52.308,010 and the
ralue $241,031,415. On January 1, 1891'tbe
lumber of cattl? was 38,875,648 and the
ralue $544,127,908; on January 1, 1S92. the '[
number was 37,651,239 and the value ?570,749,155.
If any are discontented with this state
here; if any believa that wa?es or prlcas,
;he returns for honest toil, are inadequate,
:hey should not fail to remember that there
8 po other country in the world where the
conditions that seem to them hard would
lot be ao<$pted as highly prosperous. The
English agriculturist would be glai to ex;hange
the returns of his labor for those of
he American farmer, and the Man:hester
workmen their wages for those of
heir fellow? at Fall River.
A WORD FOR PROTECTION.
I believe that the protective system, which
las now for something more thin thirtyb
rears continuously prevailed in our legisla*a
ion, has been a mighty instrument for the
levelopment of our national wealth and a
nost powerful agency in protecting the
tomes of our workingmen from the invaUm
of want I have felt a most solicitous
n teres t to preserve to our working people
ates of wages that would not only give
laily bread but supply a comfortable margin
for those home attractions and family
omforls and enjoyments without which
ife is neither hopatul nor sweet.
They are American citizens?a part of the
^reat people for whom our Constitution and
iovernment were framed and instituted?
.nd it cannot be a perversion of that Contitution
to so legislate as to preserve in
heir homes the comfort, independence,
oyslty and sense of interest in the Govern aent
which are essential to good citizenship
n peace, and which will bring this stalwart
hron?, as in 1861, to the defense of the flag
fhen it is assailed.
It is not my purpose <rto renew here the
jgument in favor of a protective tariff,
. "he result of the recent election must be acepted
as having introduced a new policy.
Ve must assume that the present tariff,
instructed upon the lines of protection, is
o be repealed, and that there is to be subtituted
for it a tariff liw constructed solely
rith reference to revenue; that no duty is
0 be higher because the increase will keep
pen an American mill or keep up the wages
>f an American workman, but that in every
ase such a rate of duty is to be imposed as
eill bring to the Treasury of the United
States the largest returns of revenue.
The contention has not been between
chedules, but between principles, and it
could be offensive to sugzest t&at the profiling
party will not carry Into legislation
he principles advocated by it ani the
iledges given to the people. The tariff bills
assed by the House of Representatives at
he last session were, as I suppose?even in.
he opinion of their promotors?inadequate, '
nd justified only by the fact that the Senate J
nd tlouse of Representatives were not in
ccord and that a general revision could '
ot, therefore, be undertaken.
1 recommend that the whole subject of
iriff revision be left to the incoming Con- '
resa. It is matter of regret J;bat this wo;* c ;'
lust be delayed for at least toree month ; j'
or the threat of great tariff changes intiv- j '
muAli unrortainf.r t.hnf: ati amount, i s
UV#P3 SV IUUVU uuwwa ? - ,
ot easily estimated, of business in&ctio i
ad of diminished reduction will necessarily
esult. It is possible also that this uncertainty
may result in decreased revenues
rom customs duties, for our inerchaots will'
lake cautious orders for foreign goods in
iew of the prospect of tariff redactions ana
be uncertainty as to when they will take
ffeot.
Those who have advocated a protective
stiff can well afford to have their disastrous
forecasts of a change of policy disapointed.
If a syste n of customi duties can '
e framed that will set the idle wheels and <
x>ms of Europe in motion and crowd o?r
rarehousea with foreign-made goods, and I
t the same time keep our own mills busy; *
lat will givj us an increased participation <
i the "market* of tne world" of greater \
alue than the home market we surrender;
bat will give increased wort to foreign ;
rorkmen upon products to be consumed by
ur people without diminishing the amount <
f work to be done here; that will 1
aable the American manufacturer <
) pay to his workmen from <
fty to a hundred per cent, more in wages ;
nan is paid in the foreign mill and yet to 1
Dmpete in our market and foreign markets 1

rithout reducing the wages of those who 1
roduce them; that can be celebrated, after '
a effects have been realized, as its expects- 1
ions have'been, io^ European as well as in 1
imerican cities, the authors and promoters
f it will be entitled to the highest praise.
We have had in our history several ex- (
eriencas of the contrasted effects of a :
avenue and that of a protective tariff; but ,
ais generation has not felt them, and the
xperience of one generation i9 not highly j
istructive to the next. The fronds of the i
rotective system, with undiminished con* <
ience in the principles they have ad- i
oca tod, will await the results of the new
xperiment.
LABOR AND THE TARIFF.
The strained and too often disturb3.1 rela- , !
ions existing between the employes and J
tie employer* in our great manufacturing (
stablishments have not been favorable to a ,
aim consideration by the wage -earner of

American workmen as has been the cose i

FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relat:ons with foreign nations are now
miisturbed by any serious controversy.
L'ne complicated and threatening differences
vith Germany and England relating to
&moan affairs, with Eugland in relation to
;he seal fisheries in the Bering Sea, and with

THE BERING SEA. TREATY.
A treaty providing for the aroitration of
the dispute betwem Great Britain and the
United State?, as to the killing of seals in tbe
Bering Sea was concluded on the 29th of
February lost. This treaty was accompanied
by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing
ponding the arbitration, and it vigorom
jffort -was made during thia season to drive
WF*?;
' 1 f
nut all poaching sealers from the Bering
Sea.Six naval vessels, three revenue cutters,
and one vessel from the Fish Commission,
all under the command of Commander
Evan?, of the Navy, were sent into the seas,
which was systematically patrolled. Some
wai?a morlo an/1 if. ia KfillAVAf) t.hftt;
the catch in the Bering Sea by poachers
amounted to less than 500 seals. It is true,
however, that in the North Pacific, while
the seal herds were on their way to the
passes between the Aleutian Islands, a very
large number, probably 35,000, were taken.
The existing statutes ot the United States
do not restrain our citizens from taking seals
in the Pacific Ocean, and perhaps should
not, unless the prohibition can be extended
to the citizens of other nations. I recommend
that power ba given to the President,
by proclamation, to prohibit the
taking of seals in the North Pacific
by American vessels, in case either
as the resu.it of the findings of the
(tribunal of arbitration, or otherwise, the re straitits
can be aopiie 1 to the vessels of
all countries. The case of the United States
for the tribunal of arbitration has been prepared
with great care and industry by the
Hon. John W. Foster, and the counsel who
represent this Government express confidence
that a result substantially establishing
our claims and preserving this great
industry for the benefit of all nations will
be attained. *
CANADA AND THE UNITSD STATES.
The contro7ersy as to tolls upon the Welland
Canal, which was presented to Congress
at the last session by special message,
*- 1 J>? i I _ J ? D ? T #Alf rtrtn
oaviug ianou wx ajjuaoaiuuv, * m*v w?strained
to exercise the authority conferred
y the act of July 28, 1893, and to proclaim
suspension of the free use of St. Marys
Falls" Canal to cargoes in transit to oorta in
Canada. The Secretary of the Treasury
established.such tolls a; were thought to be'
equivalent to the exactions unjustly levied
upon our commerce in the Canadian canals.
If, as we must suppose, the political relations
of Canada and the disposition of the
Canadian Government are to remain nochanged,
a somewhat radical revision of our
trade relations should, I think, be made.
Our relations must continue to be intimate,
and they should be friendly. I regret to say,
however, that in many of the controversies,
notably those as to the fisheries on the Atlantic,
the sealing (interests on the Pacific,
and the canal tolls, our negotiations with
Great Britain have continuously been
thwarted or retarded by unreasonable
Eind unfriendly objections and protests from
Canada, in the matter of the canal tolls,
nni? rraa rr rierhtq ware flawautlv disre
yarded, ft is hardly ton muca to say that
the Canadian Pacidc and ottier railway
lines which parallel our northern bouadary
ire sustained by commerce having either its
Drigln or terminus, or both, in the United
States. Canadian railroads compete with
those of th* United States for our traffic,
ind without the restraints of our interstate:ommerce
act. Their cars pass almost without
detention into and out of our territory.
There is no disposition on the part of tae
people or Government of the United States
to interfere in the smallest degree with the
political relations of Canada. That question
is wholly with her own people. It is time
'or us, however, to consider waetaer, if the
present state of things and trend of things
s to continue, oar interchange? upon lines
)f land transportation should not be put up>n
a different basis, and our enure independence
of Canadian canals and of the St.
Lawrence as an outlet to the sea secured by
Che construction of au American canal
wound the Falls of Niagat a and the opening
of ship communication between the Great
Lakes and one of our own seaports.
We should not hesitate to avail ourselves
>f our great natural trade advantages. We
ihould withdraw the support which is given
? the railroads and steams tup uues 01 uanida
by a traffic that properly belongs to as,
iud no lunger furnish the earnings which
i.ghten thj otherwise crushing weigat of the
:uorihotu public subsidies tbat have been
;.Vdn to tbem. The subject of the power of
cue Treasury to aeal with this matter withjut
furtuer legislation has been under consideration,
but circumstances have postponed
a conclusion, it is probable tbat a
xmsideration of the propriety of a modification
or abrogation of the article cf the
rreaty of Washington relating to transit of
goods in bond is involved in any complete
solution of the question.
THE caiLSAPT TRDUBLR.
Congress at the last session was kept adriaed
of the progress of the serious and for a
Lime threatening differences between the
United States and Chile. It gives me now
jreat satisfaction to report that the Chilean
Jovernment, in a most friendly and honorable
spirit, has tendere i ani paid as an indemnity
to the families of tae sailors of the
Baltimore who were killed and to those who
were injured in the outbreak in the city of
Valparaiso the sum of 973,030. This has been
iccepted, not only as an indemnity for a
wrong done, but as a most gratifying eviienoe
that the Governmant of Chile rightly
appreciates the disposition of tbls Government
to act in a spirit of t'ae most absolute
fairness and frienilia?sj in our intercouse
with that brave people. A farther and conjlusive
evidenca of the mutuil ro3pec t and
zonfldsnca now existing is furnished by the
Tact that a oonvention submitting to arbitration
the mutual claims of the citizans of the
respective Gjvernmants has been agreed
upon.
the italian affair.
The friendly act of this Government in
axpressingto the Government of Italy its
reprobation and abhorrence of the lynching
sf Italian subjects in New Orleans, by the
payment of 123,000 francs, or 124,330.90, was
accepted by the King of Italy with every
inanifestation of gracious appreciation, and
tha incident has been highly promotive of
mutual respect and good will.
help the nicaragua canal.
I repeat with great earnestness the recommendation
whicn I have made in several
r.~?riniia moocgrraz fhnf: nrnmntand fLdeail&te
rapport be given to the American Company
angaged in the construction *f the. Nioaragua
Ship Canal. It is impossible to overstate the
value from every standpoint of this great
snterprise, and I hope that there may bs
time, even in this Congress, to give to it an
impstu8 that will insure the early completion
)f the canal and secure to the United States
Its proper relation to it wben complete!.
HOPEFUL FOB SILVER. ,
The Congress has been already advised
that the invitations of this Government for
the assembling of an International Monetary
Conference to con3idar tha question of an
snlrfrgai use of silver were accapted by the
nations to which thev were ad lre3sed. The
conference assembled at Brussals on the
.'21 of November and ha3 entered upon the
consideration of this great question. I have
not doubted, and have not taken occasion
bo express that belief, as well in the
invitations issued for this conference
as in my public messaTpes, that the
free coinage of silvar upon an agreed
international ratio would greatly promote
Che interest of our people and equally those
a.' other nations. It is too early to predioc
what results may be accomplished by the
conference. If any temporary check or
delay intervenes. I believe that very soon
commercial conditions will compel the now
reluctant Governments to unite with us in
this movement to secure the enlargement of
of the volume of coined money needed for
the transaction of the business of the world.
THK TRKA3UBT.
The report of the Secretary of the Treaa
ury will attract especial interest m view or
the many misleading stitemants that have
been made as to tin state of the public revenues.
Three preliminary facts should not
only be stated, but emphasized, before looklag
into details: First, thit the public
debt has been reduced since March 4,
18S9, $259,074,20.'), and the annual
interest charge $11,631,469; second, that
there have been paid out for pensions
during this administration up to
November 1, 189 3, $432,554,173.70, an* excess
of $114,466,336.09 over the sum expended
during t&e Denoi from March 1, 1885, to
Mar^h 1 18?9. and third, that under the ex
istin? tariff u.j to December 1 about 193,
000,000 of revenue, waich would have been
collected?upon imported sugars if the duty
had beeh maintained, has gone into the
pockets of the people and not into the public
treasury, as before.
If there are any who still think that the
surplus should have been kept out of circulation
by hoarding it in the Treasury, or
deposited in favored baaks without interest
while the Government continued to pay to
these very banks interest upon the bonds
deposited as security for the deposits, or
who think that cne extended pensioa legislation
was a public robbery, or that the
duties upon sugar should have been maintained,
I am content to leave the argument
where it now rest-, while we wait to see
whether these criticisms will take the form
of legislation.
The revenues for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 18SW. from all source* were $425,/
* ' l 'ii -v
868,360.23, and the expenditures for all purposes
were $415,953,806.56, leaving a balance
of 19,914,153.60. There were paid during
the year upou the public debt $40,570,467.98.
The surplus in the Treasury and
the hank redemDtion fund, passed by the act
of July 14, 1890, to the general fund, furnished
in large part the cash available and
used for the payments made upon the public
debt. Compared with the year 1891, our
receipts from customs duties fell off $42,06J,241.08,
while our receiota from internail
revenue increased $8,334,823.13, leaving the
net loss of revenue from these principal
80urces $33,754,417.95. The net loss of
revenue from all sourcoa was 531,675,97J. 81.
The revenues, estimated and actual, for
the fiscal year ending; June 30, 1893, are
placed by the Secretary at $463,336,350.44
and the exoenditures at $461,336,351.44,
showinz a surolus ot receiDti over expend!- j
tures of $2,000,000. The cash balance in the
Treasury at the end of the fiscal year it is
estimated will bo $20,292,377.03.
The estimated receiots for the flscii year
ending June. 33, 1S94, are $49), 121,865.38,
and the estimated appropriations $457,261,335.33,
leaving an estimated aurD'm of receipts
over expenditures of $32,8(50,033.05.
This does not include any payment to the
sinlring fund.
The public confidence in- the purpasa and
ability of the Government to maintain the
purity of all our money issues, whether coin J
or paper, must remain unsaaken. The demand
for gold in Europe and the consequent
calls upon us are .n a considerable degrea
the result of the efforts of some of tue European
Governments to increase their gold
reserve, and tneee efforts should be met by
appropriate legislation on our part. The
conditions that have created this drain of
the Treasury gold are in an i moor tan t degree
political and not commercial. In view
of the fact that a general revision of our
revenue laws in the near future seem to be
probable, it would be better that any changes
should be a part of that revision rather than
of a temporary nature.
8ILVEB BOUGHT AND COINED.
During the last fiscal year the Secretary
purchased under tbe acc oc July 1.4, law,
54,355,748 ounces of silver, and issued in
payment therefor $ >4,106,603 in notes. The
total purchases sinca the passage of th9 act
have been 120,479,981 ounces, and the aggregate
of notes issued 9116,783,590. The
average pric9 paid for silver during the year
was 91 cents per ounce, the highest price being
$1,025^ July 1, 1891, ani the lowest $0.83
March 21, 1892. In view of the fact that the
monetary confereuce is now sitting and that
no conclusion ha3 yet b9en reached, I withhold
any recommendation as to legislation
upon this subject.
RUT REORGANTZA.TION DEMAND RD.
The repjrt of the Secretary of War
brings again to the attention of Congress
some important suggestions as to the reorganization
of the infantry and artillery
arms of the servica, which his predecessors
hare before urgently predated. Our
army is small, but its organisation
should all the more be put upon the most
approved modern basis. The conditions
upon what we have called the "frontier"
have heretofore required the main
te nance or many small pasta, out now
the policy of concentration is obviously the
right one. The reorganization and enlargement
of the Bureau of Military Information
which the Secretary has effected is a work
the usefulness of which will become every
year more apparent. The work of building
neavy guns and the construction of coast
defensss has been well begun and should be
carried on without check,
CLAIMS AGAXN3T THE QDVJSBLUETT.
The aggregate of claims pending against
the Qovernment in the Court of Claims is
enormous. Claims to the amount of nearly
$400,000,000 for the taking of or injury to
the property of persons claiming to be loyal
during the war are now before that court for
examination. When to tlese are addei the
Indian depredation claims and the French
spoliation claims an aggregate is reaoiei
that is indeed startling. In the defense of
ail these cases the Government is at great
disadvantage. The claimants have preserved
their evidence, whereas the agents of the
Government are sent into ths field to rummage
for what they can find. The difficulty
is peculiarly great where the fact to be established
is the disloyalty of th9 claimant durT#

oar revenues is to have no other check car*
tainly Congress shoull supply the Department
of Justice with appropriations sufficiently
liberal to secure the best legal talent
in the defense of these claims and to pursue
its vAgua search for evidence effectively.
POSTAL ATPAXR8.
The postal revenues have increased duria?
the last year nearly *5,000,000. The deficit
for the year ending June 3D. 189 i, is $849,311
less than the deficiency of the preceding
year. The deficiency of tha present fiscal
year, it is estimated, will ba reduced to $L,553.423,
which will not only ba extinguished
during the next fiscal year, but a surplus ol
nearly one million dollars shoull tnen b9
shown. In these calculations the payments
to be made under the contracts for ocean
mail service have not been included.
There have been added 1590 new mail
routes during the year, with a mileage of
85ft3 miles; ani the total number of new
miles of mail trips added durinz tha year i<
nearly seventeen million.-. The number of
miles of mail journeys aided during the
last four years is about seventy-six millions,
this addition baing tweuty-one millions of
miles more than were in operation in the
urhstlA ortnnfrv in Iftftl
The number of posfcofficae has been increased
bv 2790 during the year; and 'luring
the past four years aa i up to October 29
last the total increase in the numbar of offices
has been nearly nine thousand. The
number of free-deli vary offlcss has baen
nearly doubled in tie last four years, and
the number of money-order offlcas more
than doubled within that time. For
the three years ending June 3), 1893,
the postal revenue amounted to $197,741,339,
which was an increase of $53,263,153 over th9
revenue for the three years ending June 30,
1806, the inorease during the last three years
being more than three an 1 a half times as
great as the increase during the three years
ending June 30,1898.
A wholesome caan;e of policy and one
having in it much promise, aa it seems to
me, was begun by the law of March 3, 1891.
Under this Taw cjntract3 have been made by
tne xroiitmasier-oraaardi lUl oia you iu?u
route3. The erpaaditura involved by thesj
contracts for the next fiscal year approximates
$915,123.33. As oa9 of the results already
reaohed 10 American steamships of an
aggregate tonnage of 57,403 ton9, C03tin?
57,400,000, have Been built or contracted to
be built in American shipyard*.
No subject, I think, more nearly touches
the pride, the power and the proiosrity of
our country than this of the development of
our merchant marine upon the S9a. If we
could enter into conference with other competitors
and all would agree to withhold
Government aid we could perhaps take our
chances with all the rest, but our great competitors
have established and maintained
their lines by Government subsidies until
they now have practically erclu lei ui from
participation. In my o linion no choics is
left to us but to pursue, moderataly at least,
the same lines.
OETB NAVAL PROGRESS
The report of the Secretary of the Navy
exhibits great progress in th9 construction
of our new navy. When the present Sscretary
entered upon his duties only three
modern steel vessels were in commission.
The vessels since put id commiasiuu uuu ou i
be put in commission during the winter will
make a total of 19 during his administration
of the Department. During the current
year 10 war vessels and 3 navy tugs
have been launched^ and during the four
years 25 vessels will have been launched.
Two otner large ships and a torpedo boat
are under contract and the work upon them
well ad vane kI, and the four monitors are
awaiting only the arrival of their armor,
which has bean unexpectedly delayed, or
they would have been bsfore this in commission
.
Contracts have been let during this ad
ministration, under the appropriations for
the increase of the Navy, including new ves
sels and their appurtenanc33, to tne amount
of $35,000,000, and there has been expanded
during the same period for labor at navy
yards upon similar work $8,000,000 without
the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or
partiality.
It is believed that as the result of new
processes in the construction of armor plate
our later ships will be clothed with defensive
plates of higher resisting power than
are found in any war vessels afloat. We
were without torpedoes. Tests have been
made to ascertain the relative efficiency of
different constructions, a torpedo has been
adopted, and the work of construction
is now being carried on successfully.
We were without armorpiercing
shells and without a shop instructed
and eauiDDed for the construction
of them. We are now makin? what Is be- ai
lieved to be a projectile superior to any be- st
fore in use. A smokeless powder has been cl
developed and a slow banting powder for ai
Runs of large calibre. A hitch explosive, ti
capable of use in large shells tired from ser- N
vice gunp, has been found, and the manu- tc
facture'of gun cotton has been developed so aj
that the question of supply is no longer in ol
doubt. ti
i ViTTiT lm.Wi ti
The development of a naval militia, which ^
has been organized in eight States and "
brought into cordial and co-operative relations
with the Navy, is another important
achievement. There are now enlisted in ~
these organizations 1800 men, and they are 6J
likely to be greatly extended. I recommend
such legislation and appropriations as will ?
encourage and develop this movement. ^
WORK IN THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
The work of the Interior Department, al- p<
ways very burdensome, has been larger re
than ever before during: the administration ti
of Secretary Noble. The disability pension tt
law, the tak ng of the Eleventh Census, the sh
opening of the vast areas of Indian iands to sti
settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, ol
and the negotiations for the cassion of In- ai
dian lands furnish some of the particulars of lit
the increased work and the results achieved ot
testify to the ability, fidelity and industry gt
of the head of the Department and his em- at
cient assistants. ? , ' sb
The work in the Indian Bureau, in the exe- W
cution of the policy of recant legislation, has ot
been largely directed to two chief purposes: in
nrab, tiue cuiubruuub ol muaa in severalty, so to
the Indians oni the cession to the United ar
States of the surplus lands: and, secondly, to to
the work of educating the Indian for his own bj
protection in his closer contact with the
white man and for the intelligent exercise of
bis new citizenship. I have several times
been called upoa to remove Indian agents PJ
appointed by me, and have done so 01
promptly upon every sustained complaint of m
unfitness or misconduct. I believe, how- w
ever, that the Indian service at the agencies
has been improved and is now administered
on the whole with a good degree of efflc- 38
iency. If any legislation is possible by
which the selection of Indian agents can be
wholly removed from all partisan suggestions
or considerations, I am sure it would
be a great relief to the Executive and a j
great benefit to the service. m
, THE SUBJECT OF PENSIONS. le<
The report of the Commissioner of th
Pensions, to which extended notice is given jn
by the Secretary of the Interior in his u,
report, wiil attract great attention.
juagea t>v tne aggregate amount oc work ;tl
done the last year nas been the greatest ia 1L
the history of the offloa. I believe that the <ju
organization of the office is efficient, and W(
that the work has been done with fidelity. ^
The pa&sage of what is known as the disabilitybill
has, as was foreseen, very largely og
increased the annual disbursements to je
the disabled veterans of the civil war. The
estimate for this fiscal year was $144,- jm
958,000, and that amount was appropriated.
A deficiency amounting to $10,508,021
must be provided for at this session.
The estimate for pensions for the fiscal year saj
ending June 30, 1894, is $165,000,COO. Tae to
Commissioner of Pensions believes that if da
the present legislation and methods are an
maintained and futher additions to the pen- of
sion laws are not made, the maximum ez- m<
oenditure for pensions will be reached June vo
39.1894, and will be at the highest point ap
$188,000,000 per annum. th:
I adhere to the views expressed in previous to
mposAQ'aa that the care of the disabled sol- hn
diers of the war of the rebellion is a matter pa
of national concern and duty. Perhaps no mi
emotion cools sooner than that of gratitude, all
but I cannot believe that this process has tic
yet reached a point with our people that va
would sustain the policy of remitting the hlj
care of these disable! veterans to the inade- fr<
qoate agencies, provided by local laws. Toe eq
parade on the 2oth of September last upon of
the streets of this capital of sixty thousand of be
the surviving Union veterans of the war of wl
the rebellion was a most touching and thrill- an
iag episode, and the rich and gracious welcome
extended to them by the District of ne
Columbia and the applause that greeted sh
their progress from tens of thousands of poo- wl
pie from all the States did much to revive eli
glorioui recollections of the grand review, th
when these men and many thonsand others ou
now in their graves were welcomed with te
grateful joy aa victors in a strangle ia which ar
the national unity, honor and wealth were qt
all at issue. uf

The report of the Secretary of Agricul- hi
ture contains not only a mo3t interesting fr
statement of the progressiva an 1 valuable ar
work done under the administration of th
Secretary Rusk, but many suggestions for pi
the enlarged usafulneu of this important tb
Department-. In the succaesful effort to qti
break down the restrictions to the free in- to
traduction of our meat products in the in
countries of Europe, tne Sezratary has been pc
untiring from the first, stimulating and aiding
all other Government offloars, a* home
and abroad, whose official duties enabled
them to participate in the work.
The total trade in hog products with ?D
Europe in May, 1893, amounted to 82,000,- jT000
pounds, against 43,900.000 in the same
month of 1891; in June, 1892, the exports J3?
aggregated 85,700,000 pounds, against 46,- ~
500, OOJ pounds in the same month of the oc
previous year; in July there was an increase J"
of 41 per cent, and in August of 55 oer cent. st

49,000,000 pounds oC inspected pork have ^
been exported since the law was put into
operation, and a comparison of toe four *
months ot May, June, July and August, mi
18i \ with the same months of 1891, show an la
increase in the number of pounds of our ex- cu
port of pork product of 62 per cent., and an 51'
increase in value of 06>? per cent.
The exoorta of dressed beef increased from ctl
137,900,030 pounds in 1839 to 220,500,0-30
pounds in 1893, or about 60 per cent. Dur- tU]
inz the past year there have been exported ,W1
394,6)7 head of live cattle as against 295,780 141
exported in 18S9. This increased exportation
has been largely promoted by the inspection
authorized by law and the faithful D<
efforts of the Secretary and his efficient sub- th
ordinates to make that inspection thorough fo
and to carefully exclude from all cargoes an
diseased or suspected cattle. he

pneumonia existed aicoa^ American cattle, 1*1
and that the existence of the disease could is
only cartaioly be determined by a post-mor- TX
tem inspection. ^
The Department of Agriculture has labored
with great energy and faithfulness to exfcir- P
pate this disease; and, on the 26th day of m
September last, h public announcement was m
made by the Secretary that the disease no P?
longer existed anywhere within the United
States. 1'ne value to the cattle industry of 10
the United States of t lis achievement can w
hardly be estimated. We cannot, perhaps,
at once insist that this evidence shall be accepted
as satisfactory by other countries;
but if the present exe motion from the disease
is m&intaine 1 and the inspection of our
rattle arriving at foreign port', in which
our own veterinarians participate, confirms ;v
it, we may justly expect that the requirement
that our cattle shall be slaughtered at
the doc'is will be revoked, as the sanitary
restrictions upon our pork products have
be9ii. If our cattle can be taken alive to
the interior the trade will be enormously 08
increased. es
Agricultural producto constituted 73.1 per l

tottl exports being 81.030,278,030, and the p

An interesting and a promising work for
the beneSt of the American farmer has p
been begun through agents of the Agricultural
Department in Europa, and con- p
sists in efforts to introducs the various
products of Indian corn as articles
of human food. The hi^h prica of
rye offered a favorable opportunity
for the experiment in Germany of g<
combiniDg corn meal with rye to produce a p'
cheaper bread. A fair degree of success has
been attained, and some mills for grinding
corn for food have been mtro luced. The ^
.Secretary is of the opinion that this new
use of fcue products of corn has already
stimulated exportations, and that if diligently
persecuted large and important markets
can presently be opened for this great A
American product,
It may, I think, bo 3aid without challenge
that in no corresponding period has so much
I been done as during the last four years for fe
the benefit of American agriculture. oi
XEER CF .VATION'AL QlT ATlANTnOS. V
The subject of quarantine regulations, in- ti
spectiou and control was brought suddenly w
to my attention by the arrival at our ports oi
in August last of vessels infected with p;

PROTECTION FOE RAILWAY EMPLOYES.
In renewing the recommendation whioh
have made in three preceding anlal
messages that Congress should
jislate for the protection of railroad
iployes against the dangers incident tov
e old and inadequate methods of brakg
and coupling which are still in use
ton freight tram?, I do so with the hope
at this Congress may take action upou'
e eubject. Statistics furnished by the Inrstate
Commerce Commission show that
iring the year ending Juue 30, 1S91, there
jre 47 different styles of car couplers rerted
to be in use, and that during the same
riod there were 2630 employes killed and
, 140 injured. Nearly 10 per oenfc. df the
aths occurred in the coupling and uncouple
or cars, and over 86 per cent of the in
ries had tbe same origin.

officers of the National Government. In
j last annual message I endeavored to iake
serious attsntion to the evils of unfair
portionments for Congress. I cannot close
is message without again callinz attention
these grave and threatening evils. I bad
ped that it was possible to secure a nonrtlsan

every possible means. The of
