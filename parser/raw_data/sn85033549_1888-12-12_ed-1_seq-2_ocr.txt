Killing by Electricity.
Ou January 1st, 1888, the law re
quiring electrical executions goes
into effect in ew lork btate, but
the n mount and character of current
renuired to make death certain and
instantaneous had not been determin
pA. On the olh experiments were
made at Mr. Kdison's lubaratory and
the first victim was a calf, weight
1241 pounds. The hair was cut on
the forehead and on the fpine behind
the forclece. and eponiro covered
plates, moistened in a solution
sulphate of zinc, were fastened n
nlace. The resistence of the animal
was 3,200 ol ms. An alternating cur
rent of 700 volts was applied for 35
seconds and the animal was dead.
To settle permanently the weight
question,1, a liorsc weighing ,Z6)
pounds was next killed by passing the
alternating current at 700 volt from
one foreleg to the other. The resis
tance of this animal was 11,000 olms.
The. experiments proved the alter
nating current to be the most deadly
force known to science and that less
than half the pressure used in New
York city for electric lighting is suf
ficient to cause instant death. Free
Press dispatch.
The N.Y. World is seeking to ascer
tain the causes which led to the defeat
of Cleveland in that State. From the
reports which it has published of the
extent to which the buying and sell-
ng of votes was carried on in that
State, it does not need to go furthr
for a sufficient cause. As an illustra
tion, it declares that the account
which it has given of vote buying in
the village of Herkimer is- a trustwor
thy one. It asserts that 276 votes
more than one-fifth of those cast
were purchased; that the Republicans
bought 198 votes and the Democrats
78 ; that the Republicans paid out
$2,420 and the Democrats a little more
than $900, the average cost of a vote
being about $15, the bribery brokers
getting nearly 15 per cent commission;
that cardboard checks were handed
to the bribed men immediately after
they cast their ballots, and that they
were cashed on demand at designated
offices. The World says that a simi
lar state of affairs prevailed in other
parts of the county, and it has pub
lished numerous reports from other
counties of like tenor. The only con
clusion from the articlcs.in the World
is that the number of men in New
York State who sold their votes to the
highest bidder reaches well up in the
tens of thousands. Its figures show
two-thirds of these went to the Repub
licans. If the purchased vote was
eliminated and men who sell their
vote? have neither character nor ol
itic Cleveland would be left with a
larger plurality in New York than
Harrison received. Free Press.
The necessity of the reduction of
our revenue is so apparent as to be
generally conceded, but the moans by
which this end shall be accomplished
and the sum of direct lxriffit which
shall result to our citizens, present a
controversy of the utmost im(ortnnce.
There should be no scheme accepted
as atifaetory by which the burdens
of the people are only apparently re
moved. Kxtravagant appropriations
of public money, with all their de
moralizing consequences, should not
be tolerated either as a means of re
lieving the treasury of its present sur
plus or as furnishing pretexts for re
sisting a proper reduction of tariff
rates. Existing evils and injustice
should be honestly recognized, boldly
met, and effectually remedied. There
should be no cessation of the struggle
until a plan is perfected, fair and con
servative toward existing industries,
but which will reduce the cost to con
sumers of the necessaries of life, while
it provides for our manufacturers the
advantage of freer raw materials and
permits no injury to the interests of
American labor. The cause for which
tho battle is waged is comprised with
in lines clearly and distinctly defined.
It should never be compromised. It
is the people's cause.
The total ordinary revenues of the
government for the fiscal year ended
June 30th, 1888, amounted to $379,-
266,074.77, of which $219,061,173.63
was received from customs duties and
$124,296,371.93 from iuternal revenue
taxes.
The total receipts from all sources
exceeded those for the fiscal year end
ed June 30, 1887, by $7,862,797.10,
The ordiuary expenditures of the fis
cat year enued dune 6v, louts, were
$259,653,958.67, leaving a surplus of
$119,612,116.09. The decrease in
these expenditures, as compared with
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1887,
was $8,278,220.30, notwithstanding
the payment of more than $5,000,000
for pensions in excess of what was
paid for that purpose m the latter
mentioned year. Extracts from th

The Detroit Free Press has lately
been publishing a series of articles
entitled "Around the Hotels,"
which prominent citizens of the State
are spoken of. W. L. Churchill, of
this city, when in Detroit last week
was attacked by a reporter of that
paper, and the consequence was an
interesting article in Wednesday's
Free Press, from which we glean the
following :
"How is business in your locality ?"
31 r. Churchill was asked.
"Splendid, sir, splendid. Haven'
had a better outlook in the lumber
trade for years. As far as my ac
quaintance extends, lumber dealers
are in better shape this fall than they
have been tor years, lueer thing
about the effect of the elections on
our business this year. Never saw
anything like it before since I have
been in the trade. As far as the ef
fect oi) lumber was concerned, we
would never have known that an
election was in procrress. business
boomed right along through nil the
worry and turmoil.
"By the way, speaking of the late
lamented election, 1 m a Democrat
I'm proud of it, too prouder now
than I have ever been before. hen
I read President Cleveland's fearless
message to Uongress this morning 1
seemed to grow taller and wider with
the knowledge that I am an humble
member of a political party that can
produce such a man. JJut when
think of the method that were em
ployed to prevent his re-election, my
blood boils with indignation. It was
all misrepresentation. They took hi
own maniv words upon the taritt
question and distorted them into wea
pons with which to bruise his politi
cal head. I nrinlv believe that
President Cleveland's dearest ambi
tion in reducing the tariff was to bet
ter the condition of the laboring men.
His whole official career gives weight
that opinion.
'Why, right up in my own county
the Republican party used the most
desperate methods to accomplish its
purpose. And these political petti
foggers came very near succeeding in
tnoir designs up there. Where we
have heretofore pulled through with
colors flying and a Democratic ma
ority of about 150, this time I think
our maioruv was whittled down to a
paltry 18 votes. How was this ac
complished? Well, an Unexampled
use of money was in part responsible
and this was backed bv deliberate
perversion and misrepresentation of
our position on the tariff issue.
"There is one result, however, that
most devoutly to be wished for.
We should have some sort of recip
rocity relations with Canada that will
allow us a chance at Canadian tim
ber. It would be easy of accomplish
ment and would mean a great deal to
the State of Michigan. I don't be-
leve you fellows who are not inter
ested in the lumber business have
anything like an adequate conception
of this matter. I will give you an
llustration that will enlighten vou.
I have a mill plant that ia worth to-
lay about $250,000. Unless we are
allowed to handle Canadian timber,
in five years from to-day, it will not
be worth $5. By that time all ac
cessible timber will be exhausted ex
cept what stands on the wrong side of
he government line. I, personally.

possible of accomplishment at pre

union.
