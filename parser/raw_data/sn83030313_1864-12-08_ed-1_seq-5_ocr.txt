Mr. Wiiioit tald tbai In making the proposed Inquiry
as 10 tbe uumber of piraoo* exempted by the diirorent
?Mtaiea In order ihut the mutter might be brought to their
attention, ai:d, If possible, of having the uumber reduced.
It bad been stated wo would be maklog a chary* agaiusl
tbe States for derelicti'iu or iiog!eot of dirty. He did not
Mink snob an Inquiry, made In a respectful manner,
?a It donbuena wou d be, by tbe eomralties appointed,
would give any iHence to any Slate, ur be looked upouaa

died, if, on ibe (tb?.r h 11 d, no such iue<iualillt'a appear.
thvu the km wle'lgu "f ancb set would give uuqua tiled
aatlsfaction. He b?d no doubt, should any inequalities
b'i I'.uuo to any Male, llioae Stales would be prompt to
remedy them. He believed, however, there had been
?onto delinquency In deluuiug at home many poraona
wbunalgbi be belter employed in tbe army.
Mr. GtiHiK, of North Carolina, aald bis view* were the
aame now aa expressed yeslorday. Ha waa careless
wbelber tba roaoiulion was passed at this time or laid
Over. He bad no tears as to bow bin Stat* would aland
tn tbta matter. He wa* opposed to the resolution because
lie could aee no good It would accomplish, on the con
tftfy \t mioh! tid up d LUQiTcl which would do tnuch kaTiH.
M?' Hiu., of liia^rgta, said he should like to have tbe
Information oalled for by the resolution. His own Stat*
had been alluded to aa < oe of the States which bad more
me > detailed lor State pun-oar, than would aeemi to be
neoe?aary He did not know wuetber aucb waa tho ract
or not. Ha thought, however, If the reaolutlon waa
Agreed to and the States apposed to ta thte matter, they
would take tbe appeal kindly, review tbelr syatem or
detalla, and do their whole duty In the premleea.
Mr. Walks* did not agree with the Senator fr?m North
Carolina (Mr. Uraham). lie thought no quarrel ceald
ATlae on a simple inquiry. The fad U vxs want mor<n
mi our a mui. Tbe oommittee are empowered to make
tne inquiry whether any State ha? any men to *pare, and
if to. to make a temperate and reapeotful appeal to the
State iJgisiaiurea 10 yield Hem to the wnfede

peak Would U be supi'oead ibat auch an ap.

offensive or aa meddling with tbelr affairs? He
Cd not think th<t ahouid ine (iovernor 01 North Caro

later or of tbe resolution, for he tbougbt aauch good

I Mr out favored ibelrfsolutjon, and did not think any

Continuing upon tbe tame sub.eot, Governor Brown
enter* hi* solemn protest aa follow*:?
(J Ire tbe President tbla power and tba minister of re
ligion oan no longer oxerclse tbe b>gb iunction* of bia
calling under tbe commlMton be baa received from
Heaven, without a detail from tha Preiident. Tbla would
give tbe President tbe power in bla discretion to deter
mine not only how many may be neceuary, but to aeiect
tbe localities where tbey will be tolerated, and to pra
acrlhe, if he eliould think proper, tbe denomination to
which they ahall belong. Tbia would pUce tbe frerdum
or re.lgiou a* absolutely under hi* control as the fraedom
of the press and tbe government or tbe Slates.
Tbeprovialon of tbe constitution which declares that
Congress shall have puwer to raise and support armlea
must be construed to connection with that other pro
Tiblon tbat "Congress ahall make no law respecting an
establishment or religion or prohibiting tbe (ree exercise
thereof or abridging tbe fr?ed< m or speech or or tba
press." Taking tteso two provisions together, I do not see
how any cat,did man can say that Congres* hi* power,
under tho pretext or raising and supporting armies, to
place tbe tree exercise or reliulon ai d tbe freedom or lbs
pr*sa at tbe "discretion" of tbe President. Norc.n It
be denied that tbe 'reedom or both are dependent upon
bis will, when tbe law permit* no one to publish a paper
or to preach the gospel without a detiil from blm.
Is not the ? reedom or tbe press abridged wUea a news'
paper can on y be published with tbe consent or the Pre
sident; and is not tbe Independence and dignity or tb*
legislator loal wben be l* compslled to enter the legis
lative ball with a detail to bis i>ocket, subject to b* or
dered out or it any moment wben It suits tbe interest or
caprice of tbe President? Is this Stale sovereignty, free
dom of tb* press and free religion? i
When Congress en ict? such a law It converts the re- 1
publicaoism of tbe Confederate States Into the despotism
or Turkey, mskes tbe President a dictator and prostrates
tb* libertle* of tb*country, the iudependeoce or tbe pre**
and the religious privileges of tb* people at bis feet.
Even tbe Lincoln government, despotic as it Is, has not
dared to attempt any sucb encroachment upon the liber
ties ol the peopl* or tbe United Stale*.
I wish, in advance, to enter my solemn protest against
this monstrous proposition, wbiob, ir adopted by Con
gress. will not only eodauger tbe success of our cause, by
breaking tbe spirit or our people, which msy precipitate
counter revolution, but may, aud I lear will, engender a
strong reeling ror reconstruction with the odious govern
mont of tbe North as the only means of escape I rom a
worse despotism. 1 therefore earnestly recommend tbe
passage of a joint resolution by this General Assembly,
Instructing our Senators and requiring our representa
tives in Congreas ta vol* against and use all i?sslbl? In
Hiiwct to prevent tba passage of any inch law.

We are In poneMlon or fllea of tbe Bermuda Aftoetui
to tbe 23d or November lut, containing otwa of oonsld
arable Interact concerning the movements or blockade
runners. Tbe Adoocat* af tbe 9th ultimo oontatna the
following:? j
We beve a visit from toolbar Confederate cruiser, tbe I
Cblokamauga. She leTt Wilmington on tba 30)b till., r&a
tbu gauntlet of tbe Yankee gunboats, sharply ohaaed, t>M
got clear, and arrived lu Five Fathom Hole early on Mon
day morning. On ber way aba made seven capturee;
one of tbom la reported to be a bark with a very valu
able cargo or sugar. Ber commander le Captain Wiikln
aon, well known In our harbor aa bavlog formerly oo
cnpled tbe aame post on tbe Robert & I .tie. Ihe Cblcka
mauga aUo la not unknown In oar watera, having been
with ua before aa tba Editb. Captain Wilkina >n imme
diately on bla arrival applied for permission to coma Into
tbe harbor and coal, wblcb, after oonalderable delay wee
accorded btm, and tbe veaael (teamed In yaaterday after
noon.
Tbe earne paper, of tbe lOtbull., (peaking of tbe de
parture of tbe Cbtckamauga from tbe port o< at. Oeorge e,
says:?
Tbia Confederate erolaer left tbe barbor yesterday.
Some particulara of ber run from Wilmington may not be
unlntereatlng?tbe more ao, aa some erroneous reporta
have got about la reference to It. Wben abo left Wil
mington, the month of tbe Inlet waa blockaded by ten
federal gunboats, wblcb commenced firing on ber aa eoon
aa aba had eroaaed the bar. tine waa ohaaed for two
boura, but aacaped by superior speed. The following day
abe waa In chase or a aupposed Yankee ship under Si?
wben a cruiser hove Insight. Captain Wilkinson wore
round, and after another abarp chase again
got off by the awiftueae of bla veaael. The
capturee made on bla passage here were?
aa we atated laat week?eevee. Tbe drat the clipper ablp
Shouting Star, with one tbonaand six hundred ton* of
anthracite coal, bound for Panama; Ibe noxt the bark
Kmraa Hall, from Cuba, wttb augar and molaasee lor
New York; tbe third the bark Mark L. Potter, with
lumber and brlcka for Key Weet. These three were des
troyed. Two barka, one tbe Lincoln, and two achoonera,
one tbe Goodspeed, were bonded. Total value estimated
at between $400,000 aud $500,000.
Tbe rbickamauga mounta three rifled guns on t rave ra
in* platforms; namely, twenty-pound larrott on tbe p"0p,
a thirty two-pound banded rifle on tbe topgallant fore
castle, and atwelve pound rltle on deok, between tbe
rorward funnel and tbe foremaat. tfhe muetera one buu
dred and twenty ortloere and men.
Then again in a paper of tbe 23d, the latest date we
have, we Ami tbe following remarks under the caption of
"Jack Ashore":?
Tbe belligerent propensities of tbe crew of the Cbtcka
mauga, bavlog none or tbelr legitimatepafot'wni to feed
on wnlie in our barbor, appear to have relieved them
eelvee by a remarkable serlee of ?jca, ?<f*s In our town.
Saturday night week waa eminent in this respect. ?
farieue me,a came off on Uoveroment Hill at a late hour,
ending in tbe prodnotkm of revolvers. The police were
tent for, but apprwrpl to be cowed by the numh',- and ferocity
ot tk4 cnmbatanu. Captain Wilkinson and tbe Confederate
Statee' agent exerted ibemseivse with more suceeee. On
the following morning, t. mover, tbe confMot was renew
ed, and wound up wit* a regular pugillstla encounter In
the style of Tom Sayer? ?nd lack Heensn. On tbe same

FINANCIAL AND COMMERCIAL
WRDNnnaT, Dec. T?? P. U.
The gold market has been excited, with an upward ten
dency, to-day. The advance waa begun yesterday under
the report that Mr.Stevens, of Pennsylvania, hud given
notice in the House of Representatives to introduce n
bill to regulafe tbe value of moner; to prohibit tbe ex
portation of gold and silver coiuj to prevent gold and sll
ver coin and bullion rrom being paid or accepted ror a
greater value than their real current value, and prevent
ing asy note or bill issued by tbe United states rrom
being received ror a smaller sum than is thereon speci
fied. Tills bill waa very properly tabled by the House to
day; for s more impolitic measure oould not have been
brought forward, and It Is surprising that any member of
Congress familiar with tbe avU consequences of former
legislation on this subjsct should have ventured upon
s proposition fraught with so much danger.
Specie muit be allowed to remain s free
commodity, and all legislative Interrerenoe with It mast
be studiously guarded against. The decisive tone of the
President's message as being significant of a determine
tiou to csrry on ths war on tbs extreme radloal basis,
with no hope of reunion but by tbe rebela laying down
their arms and burying slavery In the same oofQa with
the rebellion, assisisd tbs upward movement, which the
report or tbe Secretary of the Treasury still facilitated.

Tbe report <>r (be toeoretary of the Treasury is, as we
expected it would be, about lbe weakest and moot era
tire document that could possibly bare been conoocfed,
nod tbe vast Importance or tbe theme contrasts remark
ably wltb tbe intlgtiiQcanue of its treatment on tbis
occasion, wben tbe eyes of tbe wbeie people were turned
to it in tbe expectation that Mr. Fesrenden would at
length bare found a policy. But tbe entire teneroftbe
I report shows that be nas no policy, and tbat be bat
tbrown the burden of tbe responsibility which pro
perty belong* to himself on Congress, pretty
muoh as If tbe csptatn or n ship laboring
In a benry see end badly leaking resigned the control uf
her to bis erew and passengers. We need hardly say
that tbe report is a public disappointment. There Is
nnthiog either definite or decided ab<>ut It, and tbe
future eourse of the Treasury ma/ be anything that
earrloa or circumstances ra.iy dictate This la by no
tueane creditable to Mr. Feesenden, as a statesman, least
or all as a financier Tbe experience of tbe past should
hire led him to the adoption of a decislra course, aud
his recommeadatioss to Congress oaght to bare bees
emphatic and decided. He bad an opportunity such
aa seldom in the world's history falls te the lot
of a minister of finance for persooal distinction
and publie usefulness. But bar lag seglerted tbat
epportualty, and failed te prore himself equal to tbe task
he has assumed, we can only regret tbat tbe coutrol el
tbe nntlonal finances nt tbis critical period In our blstory
should be rested In one who has proved blnsself so utter
a (allure, and who still oltngs puslllanlmou?ly to tbs
wreck of the policy which was Mr. Chase's legacy to lbs
oonutry.
The Seoretary does not appear to know his own mind
exactly,Judging by the tone of his clusasy report. It
abounds In contradictions, amblgultlsa and inconsisten
cies, and sbows hesitation and confusion at almost srery
turn
Henceforward whaterer hopes may hare been enter
tained of Mr Fesseadnn'e fltnees for tbe important office
erer which be presides must be dispelled, and tbe poo
pie must look elsewhere for a Secretary of the Treasury
who can extricate tbe oonntry from that labyrinth of
financial embarrassment into which It has fallen.
Raring aald this mnch of the general features of the
report, we shall glanos hastily at the few material points
to which, with nxoesslrs prolixity. It refers.
We are able to obtain a dearer Idea of tbe amount of
the national debt from the last monthly return, dated
October St, which stated It at t2,0ir,0??.6l?,
than from this report) end aa for ita estimates,
thsy are necessarily anrellable. The reoeipts for cus
toms dutlee lor the ftrst quarter of tbs current tarsi
year, ending September SO, were 110,271,001, or at the
rate of serenty-esmn millions a year) and tbe receipts
h are stare dwindled so that eren the Secretary's esti
mate for tbe curreot year, of 170,272,001, front tnis
source, may prors excessive. Tbe total eetlmai?d re
renus ror the current year In only Mio,112,880, which
Includes 178,000,000 In certitca(ea or Indebted' ess?aa
Item that ought to bare been placed under another head.
Mr. Fessendea bcileres that If ("onfrees adopts
msasures for Incressinc the ln(ernnl rerenue
nt an early day fifty mClions a year may be
added (to three hundred mlllioasi from that
eource, learing n dMktener of only f4M,874,188 to
be prorlded for during the current year. Rut wby only
flfty millions?and who knows what tbe deficiency to be
prorlded ror may be f Tbe estimated debt on the 1st of
