WHAT IS THOUGHT OF
CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE.
Congressmen and Senators Chary in Their
Talk About the Paper.
Comment of Leading Eastern and
Foreign Newspapers.
Praised by Some and Criticised by
Others—A Document Which De
serves and Doubtless Will Obtain a
Serious Study of the European
Powers - While It Will Excite
Bitterness in Spain, She nust
Hake Up Her flind to Listen to
Friendly Counsel.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.—Neither the
House nor the Senate had a good op
portunity of judging the President's
massage by the public reading of it.
Representatives and Senators were
chary in their comments.
Congressman Grosvenor thinks the
Cuban and other foreign matters will
not be satisfactory to those who have
so earnestly hoped for the early action
of our country In the interest of an early
cessation of the wholesale murder in
the unhappy island of Cuba.
Francis G. Newlands of Nevada said
that the remedy for financial Ills pro
posed by the President, namely, the re
tirement of the greenbacks and the
substitution of national bank notes,
would not give relief.
Mr. Loud of California: "The posi
tion of the President on Cuban affairs
should receive the commendation of all
Americans. It Is dignified, yet it is
sufficiently aggressive to intimate to
Spain that this country is anxiously
watching the events In Cuba, with the
hope that further effusion of blood and
needless loss of property may be pre
vented in some honorable manner with
out outside intervention."
Speaker Reed said: "It seems hardly
necessary to comment upon the mes
sage. It is calm in tone, and on the
Cuban question will be much more sat
isfactory to the country than It would
have been a year ago."
NEW YORK PRESS.
NEW" YORK, Dec. 7.—Commenting
on President Cleveland's message the
leading papers will to-morrow say:
The "Sun": The Cuban matter Is
clearly written In a style differing con
spicuously from that of the opening and
closing paragraphs of the message. Its
statements and suggestions hold the
attention closely until you come to the
disheartening conclusion. In well bal
anced periods, sympathy for the strug
gling patriots and friendship and ad
miration for Spain are equally dis
penamdL With the happy consciousness
of having unloaded everything, this
wonderful statesman winds up hi 3 last
: '-age to Congress with a beautiful
trlbsate to himself. "When our differ
ences are forgotten and our contests of
political opinion are no longer remem
bered, nothing In the retrospect of our
public service will be as fortunate and
comforting as the recollection of official
duty well performed and the memory
of constant devotion to the interests of
our confiding fellow countrymen." His
confiding fellow countrymen will not
doubt that the final paragraph at least
is Mr. Cleveland's own. Only two men
who ever lived could have written it,
and Mr. Pecksniff Is dead.
The "Times": Mr. Cleveland makes a
singularly clear statement of the pres
ent situation and of the course of
events that has produced it.
The "Tribune": It is now more than
twelve years since Cleveland by his
nomination against Mr. Blame became
the unquestioned leader of a great na
tional party. To him it is largely due
that a disastrous change in the tariff
has been effected, and but for him the
effort of that party to debase the na
tional currency and tarnish the nation
al honor might have prevailed.
The "Herald": President Cleveland
not- ■ that affairs in Cuba are worse
than they were a year ago; that Spain
baa not succeeded in establishing her
from itching and hamine eczema* and other
ak:n and acalp torture*. None but parent* real
lze how them- little one* suffer. To know that
a> warm bath with Cuticcra Soap, and a eintfk
application of (Xticcra (ointment), the pre;;:
akin cure, will in the majority of SSSSS Mtonl
instant relief, permit rest and sleep, and j • :
to a sp*edy cure, and not to use them without ■
moment* delay is to fail tn our duty.

authority, and that the putative Cuban
Government exists only on paper, and
that both sides are now engaged in a
wholesale annihilation of property under
which the industrial value of the island
must soon be wiped out.
The "Journal": The space which
President Cleveland devotes to the re
ciprocal relations of Cuba, Spain and
the United States in his last message to
Congress Indicates that he is not wholly
Insensible to the agitation of the ques
tion which has long progressed in this
country. But his conclusions show be
yond a doubt that he will leave to his
successor the honor of taking the first
step to assure Cuban liberty.
LONDON PRESS COMMENT.
LONDON, Dec. 7.—The "Standard"
to-morrow will say,in commenting on the
President's message: It is dignified and
full of common sense. It deserves and
doubtless will obtain the serious study
of the European Powers. The "Stand
ard" is of the opinion that the message
will excite bitterness in Spain, who,
nevertheless, must make up her mind
to listen to friendly counsel. Spaniards
may be excused if they detect a tone of
menace. The oondition of Cuba will
certainly not induce impartial observ
ers to say that menace is unwarranted.
The paper dwells on Mr. Cleveland's
pointed reassertion of the Monroe doc
trine in the paragraph reading: What
ever circumstances may arise, our pol
icy and our interests would constrain
us to object to the acquisition of the
island or any Interference with its con
trol by any European Power.
It sees in this the intention of the
United States to claim a virtual pro
tectorate over the continent and the is
lands thereof. This, it adds, is a large
and bold policy that is not quite free
from danger, as Spain is not the only
power with which the United States
might thereby become embroiled. The
paper expresses the opinion that if Spain
found a powerful friend in Europe to
help prevent Cuba from passing from
her hands, the objection of the United
States, based on the Monroe doctrine,
would not be of much account. For
tunately, there seems to be no real risk
that the Monroe doctrine will cause
further disputes with Great Britain.
In conclusion, the "Standard" refers
to the passages referring to the passing
of the Venezuelan dispute, and says
that the dignified language of the mes
sage where it refers to Turkey shows the
Powers that they can be assured of the
cordial support of the United States in
executing corrective measures in that
country..
The "Daily News" Is chiefly impressed
by the section of the message referring
to Cuba. It admits that the Americans
cannot be permanently Indifferent to the
disastrous war, but says that while the
intentions of President Cleveland and
Secretary Olney may be ever so good,
European opinion is not favorable to
the latest version of the Monroe doc
trine, and Spain will have some influen
tial support if she holds out for it.
The "Chronicle" will say In a leader
on the same subject hat the alternative
before Spain is really to either satisfy
the Cubans or have Cuba taken from her
forcibly. In conclusion the paper says:
"We advise Spain in her own interest to
sell Cuba quickly, but he would be no
friend of the United States who would
advise the latter to buy the island."
UTAH ELECTION.
The State Board Enjoined From Can
vassing the Returns.
SALT LAKE (Utah), Dec. 7.—When
the State Board of Canvassers met this
morning for the purpose of making the
official canvass of the votes cast at the
recent election they were served with
an injunction issued by the State Su
preme Court, enjoining them from mak
ing the canvass or issuing the certifi
cates of election to the successful can
didates.
The injunction was issued on the pe
tition of M. L. Ritchie, one of the
Judges of the Third Judicial District,
who sets up in his petition that the
election held on November 3d is null
and no account, for the reason that the
Act of the Legis'ature authorizing it
was not legally p ssed, and the ballot
was not secret, as according to the Con
stitution it ought to have been.
It is claimed that the entire election
is void, and that the present State and
county officers hold over until the next
regular election.
The hearing of argument on the pe
tition is set for Friday next, when It
will be decided whether or not the In
junction will be made permanent.
Senator Arthur Brown is the leading
counsel for the petitioners.
LOS ANGELES ELECTION.
Offices Divided Between Democrats

weller (Dem.); City Attorney, W. Ed.
ES. Dunn (Rep.): Street Superintendent,

A Circus Performer Suicides.
COLUMBUS (O.), Dec. 7—The dead
body of A. D. Carter, an acrobat em
ployed in Sells Bros.' circus, was found

SEATTLE (Wash.), Dec 7.—ln its
second flood visitation the Pacific
Northwest is suffering to fully as great
an extent as during the disastrous No
vember storms. To-day the mad waters
of many rivers emptying into Puget
Sound from the north and east reached
an appalling night. Between Friday
and Monday morning all the railroad
bridges which were reconstructed, and
the trackage rebuilt during the latter
days ot last month, were again swept
away. The Snohomish River between
Snohomish City and Everett Is six miles
wide. The Great Northern tracks be
tween Sultan City and Everett are in
undated to a depth of from two to five
feet, and three big bridges over the
Skykomish River in the Cascades were
swept away. The Skykomish River is
a raging torrent, running in many
places like a mill race. The Everett
and Monte Cristo road is almost a to
tal wreck, and it is only with the great
est difficulty that food supplies are to
be had at Monte Cristo and the neigh
boring towns.
Nearer Seattle, in the fertile valleys
of Duwamish, White Green and Puy
allup, great damage is being done to
private property. The tides backing
up the Duwamish River are forcing the
waters through the dykes and out over
the lowlands. The Northern Pacific
and Great Northern roads are still un
able to operate the main lines from
Seattle.

THEODORE DURRANT.
The Slayer of Blanche Lamont Gets
Another Respite.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.—The Su
preme Court has given Theodore Dur
rant, the slayer of Blanche Lamont, an
other respite. Ills attorneys asked the
court to withdraw its recent order pre
venting them from filing their brief on
appeal, and continued the whole mat
ter for two weeks, when the request
will probably be granted. It was agreed
that on the filing of the Attorney-Gen
eral's brief ten days additional should
be given them to file a reply brief.
When the case finally comes before the
court a long time will be taken for its
consideration, so that many months will
elapse before it will be known whether
Dun-ant Is to be retried.
WORK OF TWO RUFFIANS.
Cut a Man's Throat, Rob Him and
Throw Him Into a Bay.
SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7.—John
Van Aiken, a cook employed in the Em
porium Building Restaurant, was lured

tery street to-night by two unknown

pockets and threw him into the bay.
Van Aiken's windpipe was severed, but
the jugular vein remains intact The
victim was rescued by the harbor police
and brought to the Receiving Hospital,
where he now lies in a critical condi
tion. The police have a good descrip
tion of Van Aiken's assailants, and
their capture is looked for.
