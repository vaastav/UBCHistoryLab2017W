"The ATthor-SFolger project to demone

and to stop the coinage of silver money is
simply and solely a device for doubling up J

s From many sources qmes complaints of
the manner ia which the President, treated
the star route cases in his late message.
The proof that there had been ( enormous
stealings in the post office ' department is
undoubted, and every wTiere comes up tbe
demand that the thieves be punished, arid
as yet their 'prosecution' bas been a bo 1
ing fart'4, a 'mal'ier jit snly for ridicule,
Were the. subject less serious.1 It lias been
the open boast of star route thieves that
no republican administration dared bring
them to justice, and if we are to judge
anything from the pitiable failure " of .' the
late attempt, they are fully justified in
their assertion. Then the servant of the
government, the prosecuting attorney,' de
liberately adjourned the graud jury" to a
date when he knew that It would be too
late' Tor them" to act upon the most serious
charges, and that action has not "only not
been condemned by the administration, but
Mr. Corkhill still holds his place, and un
less removed will have charge of the further
prosecution when the cases come up
again. . " ...... .
In his message, President Arthur j pays
but passing attention to these frauds, but
dwells on the fact that "great -reductions
have been recently made in the expense of
the star route service,; which leads" the
New. YorkJVwiM to remark that "the state
ment can only be justified on the I theory
that the system which rendered these re
ductions nacessary wm both txtfavagant
and corrupt," and the Times rather sadly
adds: "It wuld be a pity if the star route
cases should have no better result than to
furnish the democrats with a great dear of
effective campaign literature-" .--.i
A, Mr. Gibson who is not the officer
whose dtfty it was to do it, bCt who prob
ably thought that if he did not nobody
would, took hold of the case and ; made a
report clearly showing up the doings of
the ring and the -operations by which they
had stolen millions.- This report was re
ceived by the authorities in" very! cold
manner, and Mr. Gibson has "been as I thor-
oughly snubbed as it was possible for high
officials to do it.:

In speaking of the Panama Cartel and
the Btand which- the- United -' States has
taken in iegard to the Control of fitn when
completed reference Is c6nstantly taade
to what is styled the "Monroe 'Soctrine'
and it is not perhaps thoroughly1 or , 'uni
versally understood exactly what the term
means. The Monroe doctrine is clearly
enough defined by President- Monroe
in one of his 5 messages to Congress.
His attitude on the subject was the out
growth of i an - agreement, between - our
government and England ; in - regard - to
French and Spanish 5 occupation of the
then colonies of South America. As ' po
litical matters stood then,; Prance was in
vading Spain and South American colonies
and had taken advantage of this to revolt,
It was plain that Spain could never ;hope
to regain ah ascendency over theni but it
was thought that Prance wduhl endeavor
to obtain ontrok." To "prevent this Mr
Canning," tbe British" Foreign L Secretary
proposed to lit Itueb, our Minister to
England that the United States and Great
Britain should should unite in a manifesto
that while they did not desire to acquire
any of the'colonies themselves, or - hinder
any friendly negotiations - with Spafn-:
"They could not see the transfer of
any portion or them - any 'other
power ; with indifference ; "Mr. Rush
took the responsibility of Agreeing to this
declaration and - communicated . it to his
own government, i iff' Jefferson warmly
advocated it and the cabinet concurred in
his opinion, la hi message to congress
in 1823, ' President Monroe supported it
and said:.' "c varj-x J.-y y-'.i i. I

H.We owe it therefore to candor and to
the amicable relations existing: between
the. United States and those powers to de
Jclare that we should consider any attempt
on their part to extend their system to any
portion oi this hemisphere as dangerous to
our peace and safety, tith the existing
colonies pr dependencies. of any European
power we have not' interfered, and shall
not interfere. But with the governments
wh have' declared their independence and
maintained it, and whose independence we
have on jgrea), consideration . and . on just
principles acknowledged, we could not
view any interposition for the' purpose of
oppressing them, or controlling m any

This was the declaration in regard to
Spanish America. ' in another part of the
message, referring to negotiations with
Russia about the boundaries of the two
powers on the northwestern coast of the
continent, President Monroe said:
"In the discussion to which this interest
has given rise, the occasion has been judg
ed proper for asserting as a I principle in
