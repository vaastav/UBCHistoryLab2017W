Time was when the word “plague'*
filled every heart with horror. Amer
ica has never been devastated by the
fell disease and now when a vessel
from Brazil has arrived at New York
with several cases on board there is
nothing to fear, for they have been
promptly quarantined. The "black
death." as the plague has been appro
priately named, is always present In
Asia, where native ignorance and dis
regard of cleanliness have rendered
it epidemic. Europe, which was peri
odically decimated by this fatal putrid
fever, has got rid of it by proper at
tention to sanitation. The United
States with its good drainage, good
living and the accompanying increased
vitality has nothing to fear from the
presence of a few isolated cases at the
New York quarantine.
London correspondents state that
after twenty-five years of bankruptcy
America's first colonj, Liberia, is now
rehabilitated, the interest on its pub
lic debt being paid. In 1871 Liberia
floated a loan of $500,000, chiefly in
England, but three years later the lit
tle republic failed to meet the Interest,
and this condition of affairs has pre
vailed ever since, until now Liberia’s
fiscal agents in London have an
nounced that the government is once
more able to meet its obligations. This
step was rendered feasible by a new
source of revenue derived from rubber,
and the interest which the bondholders
despaired of getting is now being paid
from the royalties turned into the gov
ernment of the republic by the Li
berian rubber syndicate, an essentially
English concern. The development of
the rubber industry in Liberia has at
tracted considerable attention, which
has not confined itself to the commer
cial aspect, and there is likely to be
in the near future diplomatic activity

The year 1900 will offer a consider

will repair with fresh delight to that

Hooker, the English divine, will have
been dead three centuries. His dis
tinction had the added felicity of win
ning Izak Walton's pen to record its
fullness The centenary of Cowper's
death is to be numbered with the
notable days in the new year. Many
to whom his works may not otherwise
appeal will be grateful for the
spiritual refreshment which they owe
to his devotional writing. On the other
hand, the centenary of Macaulay’s
birth will be commemorated, at least by
special recollection, by the large com
pany who are his debtors because when
he wrote history, the poet’s imagina
tion kept dullness at a distance. There
will be other days and names for end
of-the-century mention which good
readers and good listeners will not

THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE.
The last congress of the nineteenth
century, anil the first of the twentieth
century, whose sessions began last
week at Washington, has before It
some of the most Important problems
ever presenter! to a national legisla
ture. These problems are pointed out
In detail In the President's message,
which Is a document worthy of the oc
casion that called It forth.
The message Is long, comprising
about three pages of an ordinary
newspaper, but it Is no longer than
such messages usually are, and the Im
portance of the topics considered made
It Impossible to condense it In
any greater degree. Indeed. the
stronger Impression derived from
a perusal of the message In full
is the large number of subjects of
great importance which the President
Is called upon to ileal with. A mere
summary of these is enough to give
to the average man a new and en
larged idea of the amount of work
the President has to perform, and of
the vast responsibilities of his posi
tion.
It is worthy of note that Mr. Mc-
Kinley carefully refrains from en
croaching in the slightest degree upon
the prerogative* of Congress. He calls
their attentions the problems sug
gested and in some cases he urgent
ly recommends the consideration of
some particular measure, or points out
some topic which Invites their imme
diate action; but he has been for so
many years a member of Congress
himself that he knows exactly bow far
the President ought to go In recom
mendations. and Is careful never to
overstep the bounds which properly
separate the executive from the legis
lative departments of the government.
At the same time, the l*resldent shows
no lack of firmness in asserting his
own tights as the chief executive. In
1 the passage relating to the Philippine*
hee says:
“Until Congress shall hare made
; known the formal expression of Its
will. I shall use the authority vested
|ln me by the constitution and the
i statutes to uphold the sovereignty of
the United States in those dlstaut Is
lands, and in all other places where our
flag rightfully floats. I shall put at
| the disposal of the army and navy all
the means which the liberality of Con
gress and the people have provided to
: cause this unprovoked and wasteful in-
I surrection to cease.”
This passage illustrates both the
President’s recognition of the para
mount authority of the Congress In Its
sphere of action, and his resolute de
termination to carry out the policy be
has adopted until the Congress shall
have made known Its wilt
In regard to our other possessions,
the President's recommendations were
foreshadowed in these columus last
week. He urges the necessity for leg
islation extending the authority of the
United States constitution more per
fectly to Hawaii, and granting to Por
to Hico better terms commercially,
while providing for its permanent form
of government; and he Indicates that
In Cuba, the time has not yet fully ar
rived for establishing the final form of
self-government. He also urges the
necessity of a better provision for
Alaska, and especially for the creation
of a new Judicial district In that ter
ritory, with the proper officers.
Our foreign relations necessarily oc
cupy large space. In brief. It may be
said that these were never more sat
isfactory; and there are many special
instances which are cause for congrat
ulation that our affairs with other na
tions have been so wisely managed.
Such, for Instance, are the end of the
Venezuelan controversy, brought about
by the good offices of our government;
the conclusion of the International
Peace Conference, with Its adoption
of the American plan of arbitration;
the more cordial relations with Ger
many; the settlement of the Samoan
question by the withdrawal of Great
Britain and the partition of the Is
lands between Germany and the Unit
ed States; and the preservation of our
treaty rights in China, unimpaired by
any partition of spheres of Influence
in that country among the European
uations.
' Of the home topics, the most Impor
tant are trusts and finance. The pro
visions of the projKjsed financial bill
have already been outlined In these
columns, and they are in line with the
President’s recommendations. Con
cerning trusts, the message is both ex
plicit and conservative. In so far as
combinations of capital restrict pro
duction and raise prices, the President
considers them an evil which ought to
l>e controlled by federal and state leg
islation. He quotes from messages of
Presidents Harrison and Cleveland,
and goes on to say:
"It Is apparent that uniformity of leg
islation upon this subject in the sev
ernl states is much to be desiri*d. It i*
to bo hoped that such uniformity
founded lu a wise aud Just discrimina
tion between what is Injurious and
what is useful and necessary in busi
ness operations may l*? obtained aud
that means may be found for the Con
gress within the limitations of its con
stitutional power so to supplement an
effective code of state legislation as to
make a complete system of laws
throughout the United States ade
quate to compel a general observance
of the salutary rules to which I have
referred.
“The whole question is so Important
and far-reaching that I am sun* no
part of it will he lightly considered,
but every phase of It will have the
studied de)il>eratiuu of the Con green,
resulting in wise and Judicious action.**
The President has no patent ready
made remedy for the evils of trusts,
which he insists that the Congrtws
shall adopt; but he wisely leaves the
details, where they belong, with the
legislative body.
The message, ns a whole. Is one of
good will, of expansion—territorial and
commercial—ami of prosperity. Again
It is “ a condition. not a theory, which
confronts us.'* but the condition In the
reverse of that to which President
Cleveland called the attention of Con
gress; and this reversal has been
brought about by three years of lU*-
publican rule at Washington.
The Influence now i«o**e*eed by the
state of Colorado in the House of Bcp
rcoentative* Is Indicated in the vote
for Speaker of the House. The Popu
list candidate got four votes, one of
which was John C. Bell's, and the
“Silver” candidate got two Tot«a. one
of which was probably that of John F.
Shafroth. The members of “partSoa"
of this site In the House are not likely
to be able to accomplish much for
their constituents.
The thirty vote* in favor of sealing
Roberts were all but two cast by iVru
ocrats. the two being I-oud of Califor
nia and Newlands of Nevada.

THE ROBERTS CASE.
The action of the House In the Rob
erta case, however, will appeal to the
country’s sense of propriety. An In
vestigation of the charges will now lie
made, and If they are found to be cor
rect, Roberta Is unfitted for a seat in
the House or In any other law-making
body. If they an* found incorrect,
Roberts will be seated, and his tempo
rary exclusion will do him more good
than harm In his own state.—St. Louis

The Dlacussione says: "President
McKinley’s message will fill the hearts
of all lovers of Cuba with Joy. His
words, "Whatever be the outcome, we
must see to It that free Cuba be a re
ality not a name,’ should be written In
letters of gold over the door of the Cu
lion white house. The Cuban Repub
lic will be bound to Lincoln and Mc-
Kinley by lndiseoluable loads of
love.”
The Patrla says: "Hurrah for Pres
ident McKinley! He could not have
spoken In clearer tones. It Is impossi
ble for the giddiness of conquest to
overpower the deep, natural Impulse of
a noble and democratic people."
The Cubano says: "The message. In
the clearest words spoken, shows that
Justice is the guiding jiolnt at Washing
ton. Our hearts, bow’ed down by tre
mendous skepticism, are now' relieved,
and we may expect congress to speak
still more clearly.”
