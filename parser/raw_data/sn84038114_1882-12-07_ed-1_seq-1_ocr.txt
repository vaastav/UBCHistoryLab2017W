w en the rights of other credl

tors were involved, to allow the execu
tion debtor to act and deal with Bnch
property levied on as hie own, as by
Helling and disponing of it for his own
use, would be strong circumstances to
show collusion between the parties aud
the apparent indebtedness a feigned
and covlnous one. And if the jury
should believe from tho evidence and
circumstances showing such a course of
conduct on the debtor's part that the
execution was really intended as a cov
er to shield the defendant's property
from his creditors, though pushed to a
sale, and that the parties who after
wards became the owners of the proper
ty accepted it with a knowledge of the
true state of things, or with such evi
dence before their eyes as would natur
ally create a suspicion,their title would
be affecied, although such title might
have como to them through the credi
tor who caused the sale to be made and
bad been the purchaser, for the fraud
would only bo the more odiouB that the
processes of the law had been abused to
promote it.
It the jury believed from the facts
aud circumstances proved in evidence
that the judgment bonds given by
James A. Banders were fraudulent
then the sale under the execution issued
upon them was invalid aud passed no
title as against creditors to the property
held by James A. Sanders, and the
subsequent transfers to Bertha and
Henry L. Sanders were invalid and
fraudnlent; also if in the opinion of the
jury these persons kr-ew of collusive
fraud bet ween James A. Sanders and
M. E. Sanders, iu such case they should
find a verdict for the defendant. On
the coutrary, if they were of the opin
ion that the defendant had not shown
sufficient facts to warrant the jury in
believing that James A Sanders in
tended fraud aud that after the sale of
bis property he was not allowed by
Bertha to use and deal with it, then
tbeir verdict should be for the plaintiff.
Fraud is never to be supposed it
must be proved, and can only be proved
by circumstances.
After reciting several decisions in
similar cases the Chief Justice proceed
ed to consider tho points of law sub
mitted by Mr. Nields, and closed at
4 05 when the jury retired.
A jury was then drawn and the case

counsel for the defense alleging that
the defendants had takeu away the
property of Mr. Coe aud convened it
to their own use.
This property, it. vas stated, was
the farm of the pi iitifl near Kenton iu
Kent county, September 20, 1879, when
the defendants by some meaus bunted
up the cattle, drove them away and
sold them. The pioperty consisted of
an Alderney bull valued at $70, a Dur
ham heifer valued at $40, an Alderney
heifer worth $25, six stoats valued at
$30 and a barn shovel worth $1. This
suit was to recover from the defendant
$101, the lowest cash value of the prop
erty mentioned.
But two witnesses were sworn last,
evening and before the second one had
completed her testimony Court took a
recess, and the further consideration of
the case was postponed until this morn

A UsdlnK Maun fact nr er'* Views
In favor <rrr*eeirfcrkt(M * r
Having noticed several articles in the
papers in relation to street markets,
mostly against them, I think there
might be something said in their favor.
This being a large manufacturing city
where a great many mechanics live,
it is first very desirable to have cheap
rents and next to this cheap markets
are necessary for cheap labor,and cheap
labor is the only way we can compete
pith the great competition now in
every branch of buBiuess. The West
aud South are now the great competitors
against the east in manufacturing, and
one great ieason why they can so easily
compete with our larger experience is
because living and rents are cheaper
their than here.
Baltimore has its cheap Saturday
night market* and Louisville its cheap
night market, New Orleans and Cincin
nati their cheap markets, where cheap
marketing is sold to the poorer class by
venders along the street. Harrisburg,
Philadelphia, Reading, and Norfolk
have markets where the country people
sell their goods along the streets, much
the same as in WilmiDgton. In fact
this is true of very many cities through
out our country.
As we all know it is the middle men
or too much handling, going through
too many hands, that increases the price
of all most every commodity that we
have to buy. Flour that brings about
$0.00 a barrel in the West selis hero at
about $9 50, all because it must pass
through so many hands,, and so with
meat and almost every thing we eat.
Give ns free markets if wo want to live
cheap, and keep up our city as a manu
facturing city. A very large number
of the farmers who live within fifteen
miles of our city, produce a little more
ot many things than they want for
their own use, and come once in a while
to our city to sell their small surplus
products, could not afford to pay for a
stall in a market house ; and when they
sell tbeir small products they sneud
their money with oar store-keepers for
goods that they need.
I market houses,
Jersey friends. Give them a good place
jin Fourth or some other Htreet to «e»l
produce to us without any middle
men and buy our goods which they
do largely beinj among our very best
customers,spending their money freely
with us and paying cash for all they
buy.
The country is crying out for a red ■•<»

cheap markets that our mechanics and
manufacturers may live well oa good
fresh butter, eggs ami poultry, meat
and vegetables that have not been
bandied by two or three hands and

return and thereby increase the busi

so kindly said) that are complaining,
out some parties that live off the street,
or perhaps some middle man that wants
to reap a good pro tit out of some poor
mechanic that would like to have the
opportunity to buy from first bands.
In a word I, as a manufacturer, verily
believe all legislation that tends toward
driving our country friends from our
market will tend towards making* it
harder for us to compete as a manu
facturing city with our Western qnd
Northern competitors, who by their

LOCAL OPTION
iwo cenxtiEs in iubuud
SWEEP THE DECKS FOB
MO WHISKEY.
A despatch from Annapolis to yos
terday's Baltimore Sundays:
"The contest over the local option
election was the most exciting that
has ever occurred here. Both sides
had prepared for a vigorous can paign,
but the unexpected appearance of bands
of women at the different polling places
of the city, singing and praying and
admonishing voters to vote for prohibi
tion, gave a fresh impetus to the sur
roundings ami excited people of all
shades of opinion. The Women's
Christian Temperance UnioD, of about
one hundred members, visited the dif
ferent polliug places early in the morn
ing, where they remained during the
day, working in the intereftt of the
temperance movement. It was au un
usual sight to see females congregated
aboutsuchplac.es, and their presence
there was the subject of much com
ment.
They worked earnestly and during
the day influenced a large number of
voters on the side of prohibition* It
was a frequent occurrence to see a voter
marched to the polls between two of
the ladies connected with the band an'
triumphantly voted in the interest
of local option. At tho first ward polls
directly alter the voting began, the
liquor dealers charged that the female
crusaders were blockading the side
walks and obstructing voting, and the
Mayor of the city was appealed to to
have the crowd dispersed.
Mayor Martin, instead of interfering
with tho ladies, notified the police to
arrest any party who dare molest them
in the execution of their privileges.
Objection was also made to the females
electioneering about the second ward
polls but the police authorities were
not disponed to interfere.
There were also lively times at the
third ward polls. Tho Temperance
Crusaders were there in large number,
the colored women taking an active
part iu electioneering in conjunction
with the white workers. The colored
women were preseut to work on their
color, aud in many cases they were suc
cessful.
Il one instance they surrounded a
colored man who had expressed his
intention to vote against local option,
and placing a local-option ticket iu his
baud, carried him bodily to the pollr
and voted him, much to the merriment
of the spectators.
Many little incidents occurred during
the day. At some of the voting places
a good deal of bad feeling was engen
dered between the prohibitionists and
the opponents of local option, but there
was no disturbance. In some of the
churches prayer meetings were held
during the day, and the success of local
option was reverently invoked. The
Temperance Crusaders, as they passed
through the streets, were the subject of
much criticism by many, while otners
were loud in tbeir praise iu their en
deavor to suppress the liqmr traffic.
The vote iu Anne Arundel county
was not by districts, so the decision
the aggregate vote will control the
question of license or no license in the
county.
Tie election in this city resulted as
follows: First ward, lor license 113,
against license 333; Second ward, tor
license 118, against 241; third for license
107, against 315; majority in the city
against license 557. The temperauce
people, elated-with tho victory, parad
ed the streets with bands of music,
singing "Hold the Fort," &c.
The returns from tho county outside
of Auuapohs are as follows: First dis
trict, first precinct, for license 249,
against license 198; second precinct, for
liceuse 126, against 125; majority for

Political Assessment h by Eotb
Panics to be Looked Alter.
Iu the U. 8. Senate yesterday, a bill
was introduced by Mr. Anthony for
bidding the use ot the Capitol "lor other
than its legitimate purposes." Mr.
Platt called up his resolution offered on
Tueslay, asking information of the
Commissioner of Pensions in reference
to the pen ion roll and the probable
effect upon it of the passage of the
pending bill to increase the pensions of
those who have lost an arm or a leg iu
the service, or who art suffering "equiv
alent Usabilities." After some debate
the resolution was adopted, with an
amendment offered by Mr. Beck call
ing alse for a complete list of all per
sons borne on the pension roll and
claimants for pensions, with their ad
dresses and the amounts of their pen
sions respectively. Mr. Sewell gave
notice that at an early day he would
call up the billl for the relief of Fltz
John Porter. The bill to establish a
uniform system ot bankruptcy came up
aw the special order, aud
anil advocated by Mr. Ingalls. After
further debate by Messrs. Eimunds
and Hoar, the bill went over'as unfin
ished business and the Senate ad
journed.
In the House, Mr. Willis, of Ken
tucky, offered a resolution directing
the Committee on Civil Service Reform
io inquire into the matter of the politi
cal assessments in the last election cam
paign, and whether any official or
ploye of the Government was dismissed
or persecuted because he refused to con
tribute. Mr. Kasson objected to the
consideration of the resolution, and it
referred to the above named com
mittee. Mr. Caswell, of Wisconsin,
offered a resolution, which was adopted
authorizing the Committee on Appro
priations to embody in the Post-office
appropriation bill a clause reducing the
letter postage to two cents. On motion
of Mr. Kelley, the questions referred
to iu the President's message were dis
tributed among the various Committees
or consideration. #
Mr. Steele, of Indiana, offered a reso
lution directing the Committee od Civil
Service P ^orm to inquire "how much

which are now iu the hands of thei

to bo sent to Rome for ratification, as!
pposed, for they relate to
matters of morals and not of faith, and
therefore do not. require Roman ratifica
tion. Those most Interesting to tho
public are a decree forbidding priests
to attend dramatic or operatic perfor
mances in theatres, one forbidding
clerical attendan ; at;race courses and
one making tho wearing of the rabbu

priests.Tbereis also adecree prohibiting
