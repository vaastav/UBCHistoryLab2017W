Mas. Logan is much cast down by her

The Secretary of War states that the cost
of the army for the last year was $42,332,
-876. It seems that the Brigadier Generals
come high, but the country must have them.
Ex-Speakeu Randall says that Congress '
will do nothing at this seasion, except to pass :
the appropriation bills, with a little routine
legislation that cannot be avoided. If this
prognostication eventuates the country will '
be profoundly grateful.
David Davis slid oil the fence the other
day long enough to remark: "I believe that
Cleveland will make a good President and
the country will continue cm its prosperous
career" — and then slumped immediately
back into his normal condition of acute neu

A Cincinnati paper urges that the Repub
lican campaign clubs of ISB4 be kept in an
organ izud state during the next four years,
so as to be ready for business in 1888. The
fear seems to be entertained unless this
course is pursued there, will be no Republi
can party remaining when the next election
comes around.
The New York Hun rebukes the Boston
Globe for publishing an alleged portrait of
the Governor of New Hampshire, and with
its most sardonic errimucss says "this prac
tice of printing the portraits of public men
and making them uglier than they are should
not be encouraged It is reprehensible."
Shades of the destroyed Holman defend us.
The New York World is publishing a col
umn a day of newspaper comment upon tie
return of Mr. CoHkllnsj to the United
States Senate/ These are gathered from all
sources, and what is quite remarkable four
fifths of the remarks are favorable to the se
lection of the ex-senator. As between the
venal Morton aud the coporation Attorney
Depew, there is an almost universal call for
the honest stalwart of New York.
The Philadelphia Press has a short mem
ory, or, after Us hideous abuse of the Demo
cratic candidate during the campaign, It
would not say this:
It is not out of place on this occasion to say
that Grove Cleveland has conducted himself
since election with rare good taste and becoming
dignity.. His conduct since the votes were eaat
suggests that he may attempt to give the
country a respectable and creditable administra- |
tion — if his party will allow him.
It is a greater thing than to be President to
thus command tin: praise of one's enemies.

The Minneapolis " Tribune was pnbll«bed i
under the new ownership of Messrs. Haskcll \

creditable appearance. The Tribtcne sets at {

The Tribune, coder the new management, will

THE r>RESI/iEX".S MESSAGE.
President Arthur's lsst message to ("on
rress, is like bis former ones, a plain busi
ness like document. There is no at- j
tempt at bombast or word point- I
ing . and it is to be con
mended on that account. The presidents'
m usages,' fn time of trauqullity, are not im
portant documents, and really attract but
little attention from congress or the people
at large. They are accepted as an annual
matter of course and relegated to bis tory the
next day after publication.
The President makes one point which
should receive more consideration than Is
generally given to his suggestions and that
is the importance of some change In the
manner of electing our Presidents. The
country passed through a serious crisis in
1876, and again last month. The fact that
these perils were averted without serious re-
Bults, is a bright chapter in our ability for self
government as a nation, but it was a strain
which may not always be endured. The
warnings of the past should cause the erec
tion of safe guards for the future.
The assurance, that the President and Cab
inet have been zealously endeavoring to pro
mote civil service reform is undoubtedly in
tended as a suggestion to the incoming pres
ident, and with a desire to speak a good word
in behalf of the present official Incumbents.
The Tax Paying 1 Era Begun.
The connty auditor having , delivered the
tax books for 1884 into the custody of Coun
ty Treasurer Burton that gentleman put in
the postoffice over 7,000 personal tax notices
yesterday, this being an increase of
fully one-third over the list number of 1883.
The tax books are ■ very neatly and con
veniently bound and written this year,
and contain nearly 80,000 descrip
tions of real • estate. The whole
amount - of tax assessed for 1884
both real and personal is $1,230,299.43 and
yesterday, the first day for payment, the
county treasurer received $1,000 thereof,
which was considered a very fair begin
ning. The first citizen taking his
receipt was Aaron Olson, who was the elev
enth person who stepped up to the captain's
office last December and settled his 1883
taxes. Of the others who paid yesterday i
were Samuel Dearlng, R. C. Wylle and J. M. !
Warner. Six months are given to pay real
estate and three months personal taxes with
ont penalty.
The President's Message Generally
Well Received by Republicans
and Democrats*
[Special Telegram to the Globe.
Washington, Dec. I. The president's
message and the report of the treasury are,
upon the whole, well received by congress
men, although protectionists were startled
by the strong leaning of the secretary toward
tariff reform, and express regret that- the.
president's recommendations leave an open
ing for large reductions of protective
duties in order to lessen the revenue of the
government. It Is remarked by certain ar
dent Blalne men that the president's recom
mendatlou with respect to treaties with South
American powers for the regulation of mon
etary and commercial exchange is merely a
tardy acceptance of Secretary Rlalne's pro
ject of a conference with South American
countries with a view to the extension- of
trade in that direction. The practicability of
Mr. Arthur's suggestion, 60 far as it related
to coinage is questioned. The same class of
critics also remark that the two state papers
laid before congress to-day so nearly
concur with the Democratic theory of non
protective duties that they may be regarded
as 6hedding some light upon the apathy of
of the administration in support of the Re
publican ticket in the recent campaign.
There is no difference of opinion with re
spect to the wisdom of legislation for the
purpose of avoiding disputes concerning the
counting of the electoral votes in future
elections, but the wide difference between
the senate and bouse as to the method of re
moving the dangers that are liable to arise
under existing law is believed to be sufficient
tor the belief that the Uak will be left to the
next congrces.
A Western Democrat, whose views arc
very decided against a temporary suspension
of the coinage of silver, expresses the opinion
that Be action is likely to be taken this
winter to accomplish the object of Secretary
McCulloch touching the question, but this
opinion is not concurred in by many of the
majority party in congress . The secretary's
recommendation is warmly seconded by
eastern Democrat*.
Conversations with Democratic represen
tatives soup no change of . sentiment .con
cerning the proposed removal at internal
revenue tares, and- there It no indication of
what is likely to be the action of congress
in that respect! It is . observed, however,
that' there has been a singularly rapid i
growth' of conservatism among tbe
Democrats. They seem to feel a sense
of increased responsibility, and when they ;
arc solicited for opinions on important pub
''•' questions ibey refer to the appro, cuing
chance of administration as a reason for de
ferring legislation until Mr. Cleveland's pol- i
icy shall lie denned!
Baton Aiurk-h, Angus Cameron and
Mamie.i>.ou, Republicans, and Senators Pen

commend the president's message, as a

8t Andrew's day coming this Tear on San- .
day, November 30, the members of the EL
Paul St. Andrew's society held their anni- j
versary last evening, when Turner bail was i
well filled by th* sons and daughters of boa- <
nic Scotland and their friends. Archie Mc-
Leod, a thorough Scot, and one of the found
ers of the society here, bad an excellent
spread. The collation was a cold one in
consisted of all kinds of fowl, and meat*, '
with fruits, cake and ail the other concomi- !
tants that go to make up a first clans supply.
Nearly one hundred couples sat uown, who
did ample justice to tLe excellent viands, I
after which the printed programme was
strictly adhered to. The retiring president,
Mr. Todd, in welcoming those present, said: i
L.i')i. * and Gentlemen: On behalf of !
the St. Andrews society I have the pleasure
and the honor of bidding you all a hearty
welcorae, and I hone that in cumins; her* tv |
tiiclit you may enjoy yourselves in such a I
nay that this at. Andrews anniversary may
long be remembered with pleasure by yuu
all."
It has been our custom in former yc-irs to
invite men of known ability to speak to us
on the several subject* selected for this occa
sion. That custom we have dl«penm*d with
at this time, and, by consulting your pro
gramme you will we that we have pressed
into tb« oratorical HN I •■'lut- of the intellec
tual .iiits brlortglng to our own society, •
and la tbise gentlemen lam sure you will \
listen with as much pleasure, and I doubt not
with as much pront prruapn, •* you would to
-nine of those who enjoy a wider fauie for
their eloquence.
Thc*e annual Catherines nre not simply for
the purpose of euiogizluc him who baa tn-t-n
honored' with the title of Scotland's put run
-unit, Saint Andrew. Or to tell a Uiteolng
audit-uce how much wo love and admire tUc
heath fir . hills, the silver 6lr>-mns, anil fer
tile valley* of uur li-.tiv.- land, or to polut
with - !rtcb pride to the proud position brad
by Scotland in the history of nations, the
valor and patriotism of her sons, or tv the
literary pyramids that have been reared by
her scholar*, her priest* and her divines.
Although tlsrso are tbemrs that never fail to
interest or awaken tin- enthusiasm "I every
L r '-nuini- Scotchman, let us remember that
they but voice the pmlse, net of any deeds
that we have done, but the deeds of a people |
that have lived and died and did their duty :
faithfully to themselves, to tln-ir country aud
to their God. Aud if we, their offspring, i
who have left the land of our nativity to seek
new and better homes here In America,
would profit by their example and leave a
record of which future generations shall be
as proud as we are of those who have gone
before, let us see to it that the strength
and beauty of the Scottish character as sym
bolized by the rusreed thistle and wild
heather of our native hi li • all blossom a id
develop here in the land of our adoption.
And If we would justly claim such traits of
national character as honesty, patriotism,
fairness of purpose, and faithful adberencc
to truth, let us be careful that the commun
ities in which we live have the full benefit of
these noble attributes of manhood. Let us
then pledge ourselves to each other to-night,
not only that we will not forget Scotland,
but that we will be faithful to. her memories
in so working out for ourselves such a char
acter and reputation as shall cause this
new land to bless the old for the gift of her
sons and daughters.
He then Introduced the new officers, J. H.
Barnard, president; Tbos. Cameron, vice
president; Wm. Rogers, treasurer, and Geo.
Wylie, secretary. Mr. Barnard replied felic
itously for the new officers.
' The toasts of "Queen Victoria" and ••The
President of the United States,'" were re
sponded to by the band playing national
airs.
Mr. Wylie sang "The Battle of Bannock
burn," in good voice. This was followed Lv
a duett by Messrs. McGill and J. C. Myron,
"The Home Beyond," which was well re- j
ceived.
i "The land of Our Forefathers," brought
President Barnard to bis feet, who gave a
synopsis of the early history of Scotland, and
concluded by referring to the present
trouble among the Bkye crofters.Abowing the
respect they have for law, and that neither
communism or socialism could have a foot
bold in that country.
Miss Oaks sang in a delightful manner,
"Sing ye Pretty Birds." aud for an encore
she gave the ballad "Nothing else to do."
She was followed by Mr. W. J. Myron, who
sang "Jessie, the FJower of Dumblane,"
which was good, as usual.
Mr. R. L. M( (.il, responded to the toast of
the "Land of Our Adoption." The want of
room forces us to leave, bis excellent address
out, which is to be rrgreted.
A dv. t, "Very Suspicious," by Miss Oaks
and J. C Myron was acceptably received.
"Our Society" was responded to by the
past secretary, J. C. Myron, and as it shows
the working of the society here we rive it a
place. He said:
we are met here as you are aware to celebrate
St. Andrews day, to enjoy the festivities con
nected therewith, and to talk of, aud to hear
spoken of, our dear old native land and the
laud of our adoption, But when speaking of
thes 1 we must not forget our society, which
is to thorn- who are member*- of it, the con
necting link, as it were, fe'tween these two.
Since we last met here one year ago, a
good many changes have taken place,
one or two have dropped from the ranks
having left for other spheres. But the va
cancies have been more than filled up. For
instance, at ocr annual meeting last month,
four uew members were enrolled, and we
have the promise of several who intend
handing in their names at our next monthly
meeting.
During this year we have had several ap
plications for relief. Some have been sup
plied with work, and those sick or in distress
have been properly cared for, and ail bills
paid by the society. The fees and dues col
lected, as well as the surplus from sociables,
picnics, etc. a re applied, a; he necessary cur
rent expenses {connected with the society have
been paid to the aforesaid charitable causes,
and al'-hough the society has not quite as
ranch funds on band as at this time last year.
still, when we think of the number of calls
upon the treasury, it could not be expected.
We have not, however, been called upon to
put our hand into our pockets foraaiuiM
eeut, outside of our dues, for any purpose,
we always having enough in the treasury to
pay all demands upon it. This I consider
marvellous, especially this year, when an
many people are out of work
and money so hard to procure;
but it sneaks well for the Scotch
showing that they are an independent and
a frugal class. Our seven sociables have
been productive of crtat enjoyment to the
members and to their friends I am sure, and
our business meetings, which are held every
month, tend to unite us closer in the bond
of social fellowship. All in all the society
has en joyed a year of unprecedented pros
perity. Success, hnpplness and good will
have reigned supreme throughout. We must
make a special effort this coming year to
bunt un Scotchmen lately come to the coun
try, to become acquainted with them and
endeavor to bring them into our society, and
thus we shall be doing a good . work antTful
filling the requirements of our constitution.
Mr. Frank Horn sang '*Gae- flit the Coo,"
and was encored. Miss Erickson sang •♦Sun
shine after Rain 1 ' In a fine manner, but the
big three oang the Scotch 8.-.cer.tia'.Un sonir,
VW.-'re Nm that Foo, ' which wan the event
of the evening. They are sometimes called
the three Mi*, being Myron, McGill and M \»
ron.
Mr. .las. Bennett replied to the toast of the
''Lassies," and dancing was then indulged
in. The whole wan a decided success and
the Scotchmen showed that union for which
they have always been celebrated. -

A CHURCH IMBROGLIO.
A.Tempest Over the Allied Military
Career of a St. Paul Clergyman.
The Quomu received, some weeks since, a
pamphlet issued by G. Sidney Smith, of this
city, -making serious charges against Rev. I
R. R. . Riddeil, pastor of the First Baptist
church of this city. The Globe, regarding j
the matter In the light of a family quarrel
declined to become, a participant, bat the !
church having held an official meeting las:
evening and forwarded iU exculpatory reso
lutions for . publication, it is appropriate to
note charge*.
Mr. idril has lx»en heralded as a great
military hero and has assumed far greater
credit for services in the late war of the re
bellion than Mr. Smith thinks he is entitled
to. Mr. Smith presents the following con
clusions whicb in brief deny the claims put
forth in behalf of Mr. R M .

cli»rp*s then-tore were not tlie result of the
expulsion; but tlie expulsion was due to his
[miking the acc'is^tion.
Ti.e tnUum utT is ti>e official declaration of
tie ciiurcb wbich very emplutik-ally endorses
th«: pastor.
At a special meeting of the First Baptist
church «.i St. Paul, called at the request of
pastor. Rev. i; K. RMdell, to listen to a
complete review of the records and evidence
in the matter of the charges wiilch have been
made against him, after such review the fol
lowing preamble and resolutions were adopted
by only-one opposing vote:
Whereas, An • expelled member of this
cburcb; one G. Sidney Smith, baa caused to
be published and widely disseminated a
pamphlet attacking the reputation for verac
ity of oar pastor, Rev. R. R. Riddeil;
and. .
Whereas, the committee of supervision
has made a full and •exhaustive
investigation of all the charges con
tained in said pampiilet which were male
prior to such investigate n, together with
other charges not contained In said pamph
let, and ioiiii-l them to be wbolly groundless
and unworthy of further consideration, and
such finding was approved by vote of the
church. And
\Vhi:kea», In said Investigation the said
expelled member stated that be bad
presented to tne committee all the evidence
in bis possession to sustain the charges then
made; and we are now fully conversant with
all the evidence presented to the committee,
and also the evidence pertaining to the fur
ther charges set forth in said pamphlet, which
are nit Ply cumulative. And
Wbeu&as,' All the records of the commit
tee of supervision and of the church, which
relate to these matters, and all the testimony
bearing upon said charges are now before
us: and
Woebeas, It has been fully proven that
our pastor was not responsible for the state
ments \ v ilisbcd in the newspapers concern
ing his military record;
Therefore, rtaolved, That we reaffirm our
confidence and esteem for our pastor. Rev.
R. R. Riddeil, and that we offer for publica
tion the findings of the committee of super
vision, which we hereby adopt as embodying
our conclusions upon the whole case; such
findings being as follows:
First, That the charges made against the
pastor are untrue.
Second-That the rumors referred to origin
ated with and have been chiefly circulated by
G. Sidney Smith, and that so far as the said
rumors -fleet upon the truthfulness or the
enristiao character of Pastor Riddeil they are
wholly groundless and unworthy of cre

fspec!»l Teltgraa to the G!<Vj<?.l
Washington, Dec. I. — Hon. R. W. Town-
I sheud. of Illinois, was seen this evening an<l
questioned as to the probable course of Pres
, identelect Cleveland. He said that, whil«
be did not claim to know anything positive
cf Mr. Cleveland's views or intentions
other than what he gleaned from
those close to him. he was perfectly
satisfied that the course of the president-elect
would be Terr cautious and decidedly con
servative, an I will give satisfactien to both
bis party and tlir country at large.
"There will be," Mid he, "No wholesale
slaughters such as some persons look for.
Mi- who have been conspicuous and ren
dered themselves obnoxious in politics will
be promptly removed, but the
civil service law, which applies
Ho the departmental clerkship here in Wasl«
incton and those iv the pust offices in of tb<
larger cities will be rigidly enforced. In all
other appointments he will have an eye tingle
la the efficiency of the public service, and in
cases of vacancey or change, he will, of
course, appoint Democrats. I think it very
probable that he will tender one of the cabi
net positions to nn iui!cpcn<laut. and would
not be surprised to set- the treasury portfolio
offered to Mr. B. H. Bristow. There would
be some fitness In the appointment of Gen.
Bristow, a* he was forced out of Grant's cab
inet In consequence of bis trying to ferret
out dishonest officials. I think Mr. Cleve- I
land believoi iv a reform of the tariff and
reduction of taxation, as indicated by th.-
Chicago platform, and be will be
coverned by the position of hi*
party in this respect. Every indication
is to the effect that he will be purely execu
tive. In choosing the chief oiii. er»ot bis ad
ministration he will seek the best counsel of
bis party, but you can depend upon it he will
not be governed by the clique of a kitchen
cabin but rather by his good sense. He
will not by any means be the sectional presi
dent which I think Mr Blame would have
been if elected. He will give
careful consideration to every sec
tion and prove himself in the
true>t sense a national man, a president of
the whole country. I believe it will bo his pur
pose to bring the administration of the gov
ernment back to the place of simplicity and
integrity as established by Jefferson and
Jackson.^
Mr. Townshend, who is a member of the
house committee on appropriations, speak
ing of the present session, says It is bis opin
ion that it will be very quiet and business
like, and no questions likely to excite con
siderable debate or warm controversy will be
brought up.
"There will be no attempt at a general re
vision of the tariff. As I think the failure
to pass the Merriam bill will be considered M
the final judgment of this congress on that
subject. I don't mean by that, however,
that there is any intention to aban
don the Uriff reform ' issue, for
I think It will be brought to
the front as the leading issue in the next
congress. I think it probable that there will
be efforts made to change the law relating to
the appointment of deputy marshals, and
some reform in the jurisdiction of the fed
eral courts. The hous<> will press its meas
ure for the forfeiture of land grants to the
Pacific roads. I intend to bring up the Mex
ican pension bill at an early day, and have
strong hopes of its passage in some satisfac
tory form. lam inclined to think that be
fore the holidays we will pass a bill extend
ing the naval appropriations for the remain-
Ing six months of the year, and that the mil
itary academy and Indian appropriation bills
will be disposed of. Immediately after the
holidays we will proceed to the consideration
of the postal, arm; and other important ap
propriation bills.
Senator Sherman Talk* Politics a Bit.
Special Telegram to the Globe. ]
Washington, Dec.l. — Senator Sherman,
of Oblo, is thus quoted: "This Democratic
victory I regard as a great misfortune to the
country, but a misfortune tempered by a
small majority. It might have happened
four and even eight years ago. It was a
thing sooner or later expected. The long
teuure of power by the Republican party
made thU necessary as a temporary accident
hut, coming Into power at this time and un
der the existing circumstances, the Demo
crats will not dare, as they might have done
at an earlier moment, to lay violent bands
on the body of Republican legislation tn the
matters growing out of the war reconstruc
tion and the negroes, besides we still have
the senate, which Is a most fortunate fact."
"How do you think the Democrats will u*e
the power, now that they have ill" was
asked.
"Their history," he replied, has been to
make some fatal blunder before they have
fairly got under way. But 1 think their
leaden*, and especially those here in the house
and senate will adopt the rule of being very
suave and polite. We shall, at least, have
little trouble in -the senate. These gentle
men are ambitious of a long lease of place.
The election of a president has gi7en
them, as they know. an Immense
advantage. They will try to keep it.
The south they have got fixed and solid.
There Is no longer any Republican party
there — none possible. Their policy, there
fore, will be. by a skillful manipulation of
the executive patronage, to keep the states
of New York and Indiana and retain the fed
j eral administration. Any flagrant abuse of
I power would, of course, cause a revolt against
: them. But this they will seek to avoid by
j keeping the rank and file of the
party under discipline, and even possibly by
treating the southern negroes with greater
tenderners and fairness, which is a result
greatly to be hoped for as a single benefac
tion fiom Democratic rule."
"What is your judgment of Mr. Cleve
, land's professions of intention with refer
ence to the civil set vice*"
* "Mr. Cleveland," the senator
answered. "knows very , little of
what be Is saying and what
he Is coming to deal with. He seems to
be a fair-meaning, stiff-necked, sort of a
man, making promises which he believes,
! perhaps, he has the resolution and ability' to
jto keep. Mr. Cleveland may make a revo
| lution in Democratic traditions against his
1 party. ••. If he docs we may live to see it. I
j do not think it at all probable."
Dwelling on political topics, and speaking
further in a friendly wav of certain mistakes
of his friends and party in the campaign,
Mr. Sherman said:
"I think Mr. Blaiuc should have raised the
southern issue, not after the election, but in
' tqo beginning of the canvas*. luObioland
many others made a representation of the
t case on the stump . similar to the one which
; Mr. Biaine makes and trained votes by it."

The Blatne Sideshow.
{Special Telegram to the Globe. |
Washington, Dec. 1. — This week Mr. and
; Mrs. Blame will move Into ex-Secretary
I Windom's house on Scott circle, which they
will occupy all winter. It is conjectured by
many that they propose setting up a social
headquarters there, and entertain
their clique in opposition to
the social force of . the present
administration and of the next one, and will
endeavor to draw recruits from the former. ■
Thus there will be three factions In Wash- !
ington this winter — powers that be, the ',
powers that are goinsr to be (after March 4)
and the powers that tried to be and couldn't.
Between the first two the most friendly re
lations will doubtless exist, but between
the disappointed faction and either of the
other two is there likely to be more than j
a ceremonious interchange of civilities, if j
even that. It is not believed that Gen. and |
Mrs. Losran will ally themselves with the
malcontents at the Blame headquarters, they
having suffered too much from that contact
already. Their frieuds here — and they have
many in ail parties — will be eager to show
them attention, and in a most delicate mat
ter indicate the sympathy they feel for their
various misfortunes and their admiration for 1
Senator Logan's dignified course since !
the election as compared with '
that of the head of bis ticket
An ardent Democrat who arrived last week
from Illinois, in the midst of the rejoicings
over the victory of his party, paused to corn- :
mend Gen. Logan for having accepted de
feat in so manly and dignified a manner,
and expressed much sympathy for the disap
pointment he and his wife must feel. One i
of Mr. BLiine's friends has lately said of his !
future course : "B.aine may not expect to |
be preside* but he expects to have a good
deal to do in making presidents."

An Honest Proposition From Brand.
Chicago, D.c. I.— An open letter will be
published haw tomorrow from Rudolph
Brand, Democratic candidate for state sena
tor from the Sixth district, to Henry W.
Lemnn, his R publican opponent. Brand
says that while uc ran ahead of his ticket
elsewhere and bad reason to believe he
would do the same in the second precinct of
the Eighteenth ward, where it la alleged the
fraud was committed which added 900 Votes
to Brand's couut, yet, if Leroan'n claim to
this effect is correct, it would show he
(Brand) ran behind the > ticket
in the precinct. Still, from the fact that the
i ballots in the box indicate that
Lemau'tt father-in-law, brother-in-law and
other intimate lriruds voted for Brand, he
(Brand) is inclined to the opinion these.
ballots are fraudulent. He therefor proposes
to Leman that they jointly canvass the votes
in the entire district, and if it is found that
ballots of similar character has been deposited
in other precincts, the matter to be settled
by the testimony of voters, throughout the
district on the question for whom they voted.
THE MUD JCKT'S WOKK.
Chicago, Dec. 1. — The United States
grand jury to-day continued its investigation
into the alleged fraud in the Second pneinct
of the Eighteenth ward, in which the allega
tions are that the tally sheet was changed
after the day of election, taking 200 votes
from Leinan, the Republican candidate
for state senate, and giving the
same number to his opponent, Braud,
(Democrat) thereby giving Brand a majority
of ten in the district (the sixth), which would
make the state legislature Democratic by a
majority of two in joint ballot instead of a
tie as would be the case if Leman was elected
aud thus enable the Democrats to choose a
UuiteU States senator to succeed Logau. It
is also charged that in order to cover up this
fraud the sealed ballots were taken
out of the county clerk's office, ' that
over 200 Republican ballots with Lemau's
name on them were abstracted aud an equal
number of ballots substituted which con
tained all Republican names except Lemon's,
for which that ol Brand was substituted, and
that their ballots were printed on the night of
November 21, or seventeen days after the
election. According to published statements
by papers here, both Democrat and publi
can, when the ballots were examined by
the United States grand jury iast week
they revealed the apparent absurdity that
most of Leman's friends, including his
father-in-law, acted for Brand, and the same
papers assert that these relatives and friends
wheu summoned before the grand jury swore
they voted lor Leman, and that if ballots
BBttw otherwise they were not the ballot.* cast
by them. Concern fug to-day's proceeding of
tl.e grand jury the Times will to-morrow
publish what professes to be an abstract of
the testimony given before the grand jury,
the more important feature of which are
herewith given in substance:
Byron Fish, a discharged foreman for P.
L. Uausconie & Co., testified he asked J C.
Hess, foreman of the press room, of the same
estab.ishment, about printing the bogus Re
publican ticket!", and that Hess replied, ten
Republican tickets with Brand's name on
them were wanted to put in
the ballot box to elect Brand.
J. S. Thompson, an employe of Hanscome «fc
Co., said tual on the afternoon of November
21, at the request of S. B. Wright, a member
of ihefirm, he bad an engraver m ike a fac
simile of the engraved head of the Republi
can tickets, which was delivered to Wright
about 6 o'clock in the evening, that he be
lieved Mackin gave the order, as he (Mackin)
was present when Wright asked
witness to have the work done. S. W. Fallis,
of Baker & Co., engravers, testified as to
the execution of the order, which was wanted
in a hurry. J. C. Hess, pressman for Hans
come & Co., said the press work was done
by one of the boys who run the presses, r.nd
denied Fish's statement that he (Hess) laid
ten tickets were wanted to elect Brand. The
papers here have published many hints im
plicating more or less prominent citizens
and city and county officials, as concerned
in or baring knowledge of the actual work
of changing the ballots and forging the
name of one of the judges to the bogus tally
sheets.
Senator Sheffield.

Washington, Dec. I. One of the early
duties of the senate will be tbe swearing in
of the new senator from Rhode Island, Hon.

$30,000 a year, to enter the senate. The
Anthony memorial service will come later.
An elaborate tri bute has been prepared by
Senator Aldrich, of Rhode Island. Senator
Anthony's continuous service of twenty-four
