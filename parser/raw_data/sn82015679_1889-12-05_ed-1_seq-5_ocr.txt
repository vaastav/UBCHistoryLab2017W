What Republicans and Democrat Think of
tbe Document.
No state pap.r published at any timo
Trithin tbe past twenty-five years has been
siezednpon by the Indianapolis reading
public as has that of President Harrison,
and among lawyers, preachers and business
men generally few are to be found who
have not read the doenment wholly or in
part. Ex-State Senator Winter, in an
swer to tho reporter's inquiry as to what ho
thought of tho message, said it was an
excellent paper. "It is a comprehensive
document," he continued, "with positive
views on all subjects it discusses, and every
thing in it is very cleariy expressed. I es
pecially like that part of it where he refers
to tho Southern question. There is no
doubt as to who wrote that message; there
ere characteristics all through it that
etamp the author."
I consider it," remarked Gen. John Co
burn. a very able message; clear and
plain, with judicious, advice on all the sub
jects it treats upon, and in marked contrast
with the last message of Mr. Cleveland,
which seemed to be entirely given up to
the subject of free trade. President Har
rison recognizes tbe fart that this is a great
country, with many interests. He is enti
tled to the credit of having looked care
fully through all matters concerning the
national welfare, and then given the views
of a statesman."
I indorse the President's policy, espe
cially, on civil rights," said ex-Lieutenant-governor
Hanna. "It is a good, strong mes
sage on that subject. His views
on the silver question are agreeable;
as to his (uitrgestions regarding pensions
1 do not think he goes far enough. Yet it
is a good, strong message, equal, if not su-
Jerior, to the messages that have gene be
ore it. I think that it will bo generally
indorsed as an excellent state paper."
"1 think." A. J. Beveridge remarked, in
giving his opinion, "it is a messazo of un
usual strength. Its recommendations con
cerning tho preservation of tho rights of
all citizens could not have been delivered
more strongly, with greater justice oriuoro
.eloquently. Unless tho rights of all citi
zens are maintained tho Republic is a liar."
"I have only read a part of it," said ex
Governor Isaac I Gray, iu answer to the
reporter's question. The Governor ap
peared very reticent, and the report
er encouraged him to talk. "What
pirt did you read?" he inquired.
The Governor hesitated, and then went for
ward with extreme caution, as if he feared
the message was loaded, and it might ex
plode and kill a vice-presidential possibil
ity. "I only read that part which speaks
of the surpliiK." said the Governor. "He
stands on the Republican platform, which,
of course, is not my stand-point. Yes, ho
stands upou the Republican platform in tho
matter of a reduction of the surplus."
"Yes, sir." cheerily replied ex-Senator
Joseph E. McDonald to' the reporter's ques
tion. "I have read the message, and I will
eay it is a fairly good document, from a Re
publican stand-point. It certainly adheres
strictly to the doctrine of protection as laid
down" by the Chicago platform, advising,
however, a reduction of tho revenue,
"which will bo clearly -unnecessary if the
recommendations in the document regard
ing public expenditures are earned out.
On tho contrary, we will want more reve
nue to meet the obligations these recom
mendations will necessarily create. The
dependent pension bill and the Illair educa
tional bill, without saying anything about
the recommendations in regard to internal
improvements, aud coast defenses, and ship
bounties, would take up any surplus that
is being raised under the present schedule.
President Harrison's reference to our for
eign relations is very satisfactory, though
it opiiih tn mn tin miirht luivn ,mrh:iizfH
the fact that a new republic had been
horn in outn America and have given it a
more hearty welcome. Nor is it very clear
under his view of the question that we
will be able to recognize our new sister, as
that recognition appears to depend upon
satisfactory evidence furnished to our
JStato Department that a majority of tho
people of Brazil are in favor of a popular
government. It occurs to mo that a ma
jority constitutes a popular government."
"I read those portions of the message,"
said the Hon. John M. liutler, "on tho
topics of finance and taxation, the silver
and Southern question somewhat hastily,
hut I am heartily in accord with the prin
ciples announced and tho statements made
ndrr those heads. The Southern question
is. I think,. well and strongly put and as it
should bo. If this Congress fails to comply
"with President Harrison's suggestion as to
the Southern question it will fail to do its
duty. 1 am a little doubtful whether it
will not be necessary to do more than
merely strengthen the existing laws on
that subject, as recommended, in the mes
sage. In my opinion it will he found that
any strengthening of the law as it now
stands by taking under federal jurisdiction
and control the entire matter of election of
Congressmen in the Southern States will
prove a failure. We have tried reasonable
and accommodating measures t an ex
treme degree, and the time has now fully
come for tho Nation to cither give the col
ored man his rights, and protect him in
, them, or acknowledge its inability to do so.
"On the silver question." continued Mr.
.ltatler, "I fully agree -with the message,
that ittis an exceedingly dillicult and, per
haps, dangerous question to handle, yet I
am perfectly sat is tied that our government
needs to preserve, in whatever way neces
sary, a bimetallic standard, and the de
monetization of silver should be repealed
insofar as it is practicable. I would re
joice to see a silver dollar current in every
couutry of North and South America
equal with a gold dollar for tho purposes of
trade and commerce. If that simple thing
could be accomplished it would, increase
our trade with the governments of South
America immeasurably. 1-heartily agree
with that clause of that portion of the mes
sage relating to the withdrawal of govern
ment deposits in national banks. It was a
hazardous experiment in tho first place,
and its continuance would, in my judg
ment, be fraught with great danger. The
message is a great state paper, and will bo
found, as a whole, satisfactory to a great
majority of tho people
"The message, as a whole, is one of the
cleanest cut. most concise document I ever
read," said Jecretary of State Grilhn. "It
goes without anj siiperlluities direct to tho
meat of every subject with which it deals.
I am especially pleased with tho man
ner with which it refers to the
Southern question. It is certainly .em
inently fair to tho colored people
whoso votes are being suppressed in
the South, and no fault can be found with
it by any class of citizens who desire to s e
the laws enforced, ami favor equal rights,
civil and political. The position tho Presi
dent takes cn the pensioning of disabled
soldiers without regard to the cause of dis
ability ia.a long stride in tho right direc
tion and if acted upon by Congress will bo
a great improvement over existing laws.
The message ought to receive the approval
of every fair minded citizen."
"The Prvtddtnt shows that he knows
what it is to xecut? tho civil-rervict law,"
remarked L. U. Swift, tho well-known civil
service advocate. "As he Kays, its present
greatest need is puWic confidence that com
petitors will be fairly treated. It would bo
Ies than generous not to say that this cod
Jidenro is being built up by an enforcement
of the law such as has never been known
he fore. His definition of tho elements
which should protect an oiticer against ar
bitrary removal must satisfy the most ex
acting; yrt the question may be asked:
Why has he allowed so many arbitrary re
movals where these elements were pres
entr RAILWAY MKN PLL'ASED.
They Appreciate th Keeomiiiendation to
Cangreft 3Ind in Their Interest.
'The recommendations of President Har
rison to Congress that something be done to
prevent, as far as possibly tho killing or
crippling of men employed in the railroads
of the country, meet with heart approval
cn tho part of that cIabsof men here. Many
of them have beenjin the service for years,
and understand well the dangers to which
they are subjected. Their favorable com
ment on the message were prompt and
freely given yesterday, showing that the
recommendations are near to what is often
discussed in railroad circles. Indeed, that
part of the message seemed to set aside all
other topics of conversation for tho while,
and what was said can be learned from the
following expressive remarks of men in
several grades of tho service:
I). F. Whitcomb, superintendent of the
Union Railway Company: These recom
mendations are in the right direction, and
there should be no dilly-dallying in the
matter.
John Ewan, superintendent of the Cleve
land division of the Dig Four: The sugges
tion is a good one. A uniform coupler
should be agreed upon, and every road
would doubtless adopt it.
Superintendent Yilson, of the Ohio, In
diana fc Western: It is a move in the
right direction, and one which trainmen
will certainly appreciate.
Superintendent Dennett, of the Chicago,
St. Louis & Pittsburg: Tho 1-reaideut is
right in the matter, and the Pennsylvania
people are now equipping all their new
cars with an automatic coupler and air
brakes. N. K. Elliott, superintendent of transpor
tation of the Vandalia: It's not only busi
ness, but the key-note.
George Farrington, treasurer of the Van
dalia: He struck it right, and the men wili
appreciate it.
R. Satlcrd, trainmaster and superintend
ent of transportation of the Jeflersonville.
Madison &V. Indianapolis road: It's a good
thing. There are entirely too many men
crippled and killed in this branch of the
eervicq,
J. W. Grennen, trainmaster of the C St.
L. & P.: it's good sense on tho part of the
President.
Harvey Noel, assistant to Superintendent
Whitcomb: Harrison's head w level, and
there should be no delay in carrying outhjs
recommendations.
J. (). Hicks, general yardmaster of the
Dig Four system: Nothing will ever be
doue in the matter of railroad safety ap
pliances until Congress takes it in hand.
The men are all pleased with the position of
the President.
Joseph Avcrill. genera! yardmaster of
the Vandalia: The men with whom I have
talked aro all pleased at a President of tho
United States taking sonv? interest in their
allairs. Safety appliances have been dis
cussed for years m the meetings of the
Yardmasters' Mutual Beneiit Associaton,
which is so frequently called upon to pay
benefits to the friends of killed or crippled
yard men.
While Mr. Averill was talking a train ran
into the yard from tho west, bringing a man
whose hand had been mashed when
coupling cars in tho outer yards. Ono of
the switchmen remarked here is an exam
ple for President Harrison right at hand.
I. D. Baldwin, a freight brakeman and
conductor lor sixteen years: I hope the
President and Congress will push the mat
ter. I have seen for years the great need
of something to prevent so much killing
and crippling of men in the train service.
Fred Ellison, who looks after injured
men on tho Vandalia: It's a good sugges
tion, that of the President. There is no
politics in it. Too many men are killed
and crippled in this branch of the service.
T. J. Jameson, a switchman on the Union
tracks: 1 read the recommendations of
the President, aud they aro just what good
sense and earo for men would dictate.
F. Matlock, switchman: The roads will
come into an arrangement without much
uruing if a coupler is brought out which
will do the work satisfactorily." I am glad
one President has thought enough of tho
men in this branch of the service to recom
mend the use of safety appliances.
XV. II. Ela, switchman: It is ono of the
President's best recommendations.
II. Keen, a veteran engineer: It's a good
thing. Fully 50 per cent, of the accidYnts
to men on roads with which 1 have been
connected were caused by the lack of
safety appliances.
Pitts Morris, an engineer on the Lafce
Erie & Western for twenty years: Tho
daily accidents when coupling cars should
convince anybody that something should
be done to prevent the maiming of so many
men.
Conductor Letter, tm tho Ilig Four: Au
tomatic couplers aud air-brakes are both im
portant to handling trains safely. With
these a freight man's duty would be much
less hazardous aud accidents largely pre
vented. The recommendations of the Pres
ident are good.
W. E. Manning: Something ought to bo
dono to stop the killing and crippling of
men so often, ami the President s recom
mendations should be heeded.
Trainmaster Cummings, of the Ohio, In
diana V Western: Something should be
done in the matter. A better coupler should
be adopted, aud all dead woods and inferior
couplers dispensed with. If tho President
can stir thevrartioads up in the matter tho
men will appreciate it.
James Morarity, storekeeper of the Big
Four:! I am a Democrat, but agreo with the
President in his recommendations.

. PLYMOUTH CHURCH IIAKVARD QUARTET.
The third entertainment of the Indianap
olis Lecture Course occurred last night,
when the Harvard Quartet. Mrs. Laura
Dainty, reader, and Miss Gertrude Lufkin.
cornetist and pianist, pleased an audience
that filled every seat in the auditorium.
The quartet is composed of W. E. Paine,
first tenor, C. 31. Collins, second tenor; F.
E. Kendall, baritone, and C. E. Jhirnham,
basso, each of "whom possesses a Vino voice
that is well cultivated. They presented a
programme of pleasing variety, and
were generous in the matter of re
sponding to applause, as were the
ladies. There were eleven numbers
on the programme, " and they gave
twenty. The singers gave "Breeze of the
Night," "Nellie Was a Lady;" two college
songs, ft medley "There Was a Man," "An
nio Laurie," "Nearer, my God. to Thee" and
"The Grasshopper." The latter was a fun
ny coneeiv familiar to many, but without
the odd arrangements of parts ns the
students rendered it. Mr. Paine, who has
a sympathetic alto voice, and Mr. Bumham,
a fine basso, were heard in solos and con
firmed tho good opinion every one had
formed of them. Mrs. Laura Dainty seems
like an old friend. She has been heard here
several times and tho reception ac
corded her was enthusiastic. Her selec
tions were given with grace and linish, aud
while all have been heard before, with tho
possible exception of the encore, "The
Telephone they were received with'
marked favor. "The Model Sermon," by
Mother Hubbard; "Bill Mason's Bride," by
Bret Harte; "The Jiners." "Schneider Sees
Leah" aud "The Shamrock" were
her numbers, aud each showed
her to be an artist. Miss Lufkin
is an accomplished musician, as she
plays tho cornet and piano equally well.
The variations of several melodies were ex
cellently given, and Liszt's ditlicnlt ar
rangement of "Bigoletto" was n4 success
fully played as the cornet numbers. She is
a graceful player, and won the andienco
not only with her music but her manner.
The next entertainment will be William
Nye and J Ames Whitcomb Riley next
Wednesday evening, when they will give
one of their popular evenings of readings.
KXGLIHl'S OPEKA-I!01sk-.haKRI(;a.V.
There was a good audience at English's
Opera-house, last night, to seo Edward
JIarrigan and his company in his drama of
"Old Lavender." The play abounds in
New York street scenes and characters
which have a flavor of low life about them
that is very near to nature. Tho songs in
cidental to the play aro numerous and suf-
iiciently varied to make a highly-attractivo
programme in themselves. The plot
of tho play is a matter of little
conscience, but it serves as a setting for a
line piere of character-acting by Mr. llarri
gan, who, ns. Old Lavender, alternately
moves the audience to tears and laughter.
The last sccuo in tho last act, the meeting
between the brothers, which gives theactor
full play iu his role of a weak and broken
man, wrecked by drink, is a straugely mov
ing piece of pathos. To-night, the last of
the engaiieineut, Mr. Harrigan will appear
iu the tit 1 role of another of his plays,
"Waddy Googan."

Christmas for the Insane.
Superintendent Wright, of the Central
Hospital for the Insane, has sent out a cir
cular calling attention to tho approach of
Christmas. He statest herein that it would
he a proper and pleasSnt thing to remem
ber the unfortunate beings in the institu
tion under his charge, by giving them some
token of the time when good cheer is un
limited. "We do not beg a donation," says
the Doctor in his circular, "but if the peo
ple would enjoy their own Christmas better
through having contributed to the happi
ness of our insane patients wo will be glad
to receipt for any cash, money order, draft
or check that may be sent and we assure
the senders that the amount shall bo ex
pended for the purpose named."

therefore, singular that those alllicted with this
fearful disease should not make 'it tho object of
their lives to rid themselves of it. Deceptive
remedies concoc ted by ignorant pretenders to

life of misery rather than torture themselves
with doubtful palliatives.
