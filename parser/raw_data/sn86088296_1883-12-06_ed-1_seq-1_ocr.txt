PAUPER EMIGRATION.
The question has arisen touching deporta
tion of the l ulled .Slates from Hie l.iitish
Islands, by governmental or municipal aid, of
persons unahle there to gain a living and
equally a burden on the community here,
huch of these persons as are under the pauper
class, as delini d by the law, have been sent
back In accordance with the provisions of our
statutes. Her majesty's government has in
sisted that precautions have been taken before
shipment, which has, however, in so many
cases proven Ineffectual, and esneclally so in
certain recent instances of nei-uy emigrants
reaching our territory through Canada, that a
revision of our legislation upon this subject
may be deemed advisable. Correspondence
relative to the C.layton-IUilwcr treatv has been
conducted and will he laid before Congress.
I'OUK l'UOUIMTIOX.
Legislation In France against the Importa
tion of prepared swine products from the
United States has been repealed. That result
has been due no less to the friendly representa
tions of this government than to a growing
conviction in France that restrictions lira not
demanded by any real danger to health, (ier
mauy still prohibits the introduction of all
swine products from America. 1 extended to
the imperial government a frieudlv invitation
to send experts to the United State's to inquire
whether the use of these products was danger
ous to the health. This invitation was declined.
1 have believed it of such Importance, however,
that the exact facts will be. ascertained
and proinulga.ed. I have appointed
a competent commission to make
a thorough investigation of the sul
Ject. Its members have shown their public
Bpirlt by accepting the trust without pledge of
vonipcusuiiou. i irusi congress win see !n nut
national and international bearing of the mat-
ter sullleieut motive ol 'providing for, at least
for reimbursement of, such expenses as they
may incur.
RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA.
The coronation of the czar affords this gov
ernment an occasion for testifying its contin
ued friendship in sending a special envoy and
a representstive of the navy to attend the
ceremony. While there have arisen during
the year no grave questions alfecting the
status in the Russian empire of American citi
lzeus or other faith than held by the national
church, this government remains linn in its
conviction that the rights of citizens abroad
will be In no way affected by their religious
belief.
OUB RELATIONS WITH SPAIN.
It Is understood til at measures lor removal
ol restriction which now burden our trade wilh
Cuba and l'orto Rico are under consideration
by the Spanish government. The proximate
of Cuba and the neculiar method of adminis
tration which there prevails necessitate a con-
stant discussion and appeal on our part from
me proeeeuiugs oi mo insular autnoi
regret to say the just protests of this
io Insular authorities. I
; protests of this irovern-
inent have not as yet produced a satisfactory
result. The commission annointed to decide
certain claims of our citizens against the Span
ish government alter the reeoguization of sat
isfactory rules as to the validity and force of
naturalization of the United Slates finally ad
journed. Some of its awards, though made
two years ago, are not yet paid. Xlie specie
payments expected of claims to a large
amount, which were held by the late
commission without its jurisdiction,
have been diplomatically presented
to the Spanish government as the action of
the colonial authorities which had given rise i
to theso claims was admittedly illegal. Full'
reparation for injury sustained by our citizens
should n no longer dela.ved. The ca o of the
"Masonic" has not yet reached a settlement;
the Manilla court found the proceedings ol
which this government has complained were
unauthorized and it is hoped the government
of Spain will not ' vhold the speed v reparation
which it in a so sc. oi just ice should impel it to
oiler for the ur.usual severity and unjust ac
tion ol its coordinate colonial otlieer.
In we case of this vessel the ilelvetiim has
proposed the Inauguration of a class of inter
natioual treuties for Uierel'Ormcn: ;o ai'bitraticn
of grave questions between nations. This gov.
eminent haSjiissentcd to the proposals of lie-I
gotiatiou ol such a treaty wtth Switzerland,
BULGARIA.
Under the treaty of Berlin tiie liberty of eon-s-rlpts
and civil rights aro assured to all
strangers in Bulgaria. As the United States
Iiave no distlct convention relations with that
country, and Is not a party to the treaty, they
should, in my opinion, maintain diplomatic
representation at Serviti, for the improvement
of the intercourse and the proper protection of.
the many Americans who report to that cotin
as missionaries ami teachers. I suggest
. uiJt 1 be given authority to establish an agency
a..d consulate-general at the liulgai mil capi
tal. TURKEY.
The United States are now participating In a
revision ol the tariffs of the Ottoman Kinpiro.
They have assented to the application of a li
cense tax to foreigners doing business in Tur
key, but have opposed the oppressive storage
tax on petroleum brought into the ports ol that
country.
EGYPT.
The government of the Khedive has proposed
that the authority of the mixed tribunals in
ligypt be extended so as to cover the citizens
of the United States accused of prime, who are
now tried before consular courts. This gov
ernment Is not indisposed to accept the change,
but believes its terms should be submitted for
criticism to the commissioners appointed to
devise the whole subject.
MEXICO.
' At no time In our national history has there
been more mamlest close relation wilh a
neighboring state than now with respect to
Mexico. The rapid influx of her capital and
enterprise into Mexico, sho vs what must be
the vast reciprocal advantages which must at
tend the progress of its internal development.
Tho treaty of commerce of 1SI8 is sns
tained by the Mexican government, and in the
absence of conventional engagements, the
rights of our citizens in Mexico now depend
on the domestic statutes of that leptiblic.
There have been instai ces of harsh enforce
ment of laws against our residents and citizens
iu Mexico and denial of the diplomatic resort
for their protection.' The Initial step toward a
better understanding has boen taken In the
negotiations by tho commission authorized by
congress of a treaty which is still before the
stale awaiting its approval. The provisions
for the recii rocal crossing of the frontier by
the troops in pursuit ( hostile Indians has
beeu prolonged for another year. The opera
tion of tile forces of both governments against
the savages has been successful and several
of their most dangerous bands have been
captured and disposed of by the skill and valor
of the United Slates and M-xican soldiers,
fighting In a common cause. The convention
lor the re-survey ot the boundary from the Rio
Grande to the Pa" ihe having been ratified anc
exchanged, preliminary reeonnoisaiice therein
as stipulated have been effected. It rests with
Connress to make provision for completing the
survey and re-locating the boundary monu
ments, a convention signeu wim aiexico oiuy

cases of lien jamln Weilanand the Abra silver
mining company. In whose favor awards were .
made by tin) lato American and Mexican
claims commission. That convention still
awaits the consent ot the senate; in the mean
while, because ol charges of fradulent awards
which have been made, a new commission is
necessary. Hie executive has eirected the
suspension ot payments of the distribution
from Mexico.
CENTRAL AMERICA.
Our geographical proximity to Central Amer
ica and our political and commercial relations
with the states of that country justify, in my
judgment, such a material Increase of commer
cial consular corps as to place at the capital a
consul general.
8OUTH AMERICAN STATES.
The contest between Bolivia, Chill and
Peru has passed from the stago of strategic
hostilities to that of the negotiate, in which the
counsels of those governments have been ex
ercised. The demands of Chili for absolute
cession of territory have been nialntsined and
are accepted by the party of General lglesias
t the extent of concluding a treaty ol peace
with the government of the Chilian general in
conformity with the terms of the protocol
signed iu May last between the Chilian com
mander and General lelesias, has beeu form
ally recognized by Chill, as the president of
Peru and his government Instituted at Lima,
which has been evacuated bv the Chil
ians. A call has been Issued by Gen
eral lglesias for a representative as
bembly to be elected on tiie 13th of January,
and to meet at Lima on the 1st of March uext.
Mr. White, the nrovincial governor of Gen.
Iglesias.has applied for recognition to the prin
cipal powers ol America and Europe. When
the will of the Peruvian neonle shall be mani
fested I shall not hesitate to recognize the
government approved by them.
BOLIVAR AND WASHINGTON.
Diplomatic and naval representatives In this
government anenu iu Lunwas uie iTiitcjiumi
celebration of the birth of the illustrious Boli
var, and at the same time the inauguration of
thM siAtne of Washini!tou in the Venezuelan
capital, testifying to the veneration of his
niemorv held there. Congress at its last ses
sion authorized tiie executive to pmjiose to tho
Venezuelan government the iqieiiing of the
swards of the mixed commissions of Caracas.
The departure from tins country of the Ven
ezuelan minister has delayed the ejH'tiing of
negotiations for reviving the commissions. This
government holds that until the establishment
of a treatv upon this subject, the Venezuelan
government must continue to make the pay
ments provuieu 111 me convention ui io.
There Is ground for believing tiiat the dispute
growing out 01 tne unpaid oougaiion aue iroin
V enezuela to France will lx satisfactorily ad-
in
basis of settlement which ntii'ts my approval
but as it involves a rirasting of the annual

advisable to submit the proxsed question to

VOL. XIII.
KING KALAKUA.
At the recent coronation of his majesty. King
Kalakua, this government was represented,
both diplomatically and by a formal visit of a
vessel of Witr.
TIIH HAWAIIAN TREATY.
The question -it modifying the existing re
procity treaty with Hawaii is now before con
gress, and I am convinced the charges of abuse
and frauds under that treaty have b-eu exag
gerated and I nmc-w the suggestion of last year
that the treaty be tnodilied wherever its pro
visions have pnved onerous to legitimate trade
be; ween the two countries. I am not disposed
to favor the entire cessation of treaty rela
tions which have fostered good will between
tiie countries and contributed toward the
equality uf Hawaii in the family of uatious.
TERSIA, SI AM AND CORE A.
I n pursuance of the policy declared by this
government, of extending our interviews with
the Eastern nations, negotiations have been
established in Persia. Siam and Corea. It is
probable that permanent missions In these
count ries will, ere long.be maintained in Uie
United states. A sjiecial assembly from Siam
is on its way hither. A treaty of relations
wii h Corea was perfected by exchange at See
oui, on the Will of May, last, of ratifications of
the lately concluded convention, and envoys
f.'om the king of Tahchosun have visited
this country and received a cordial wel
come. Corea is as yet unacquainted with
tiie methods of western civilization, and now
Invites the attention of those interested in the
advancement of our foreign trade, as it needs
the implements and products which the United
States are ready to supply. We seek no mo
nopoly over its commerce and no advantages
over other nations, but as the Chesunes-, in
reaching fora highercivllization, have confided
in this icpublic, we cannot regard with Indif
ference any encroachments on their rights.
CHINA.
China, by the payment of money indemnity,
has settled for certain of the long pending
claims of our cit izens, and 1 have strong hopes
that the remainder will soon be adjusted.
Questions have arisen touching tiie rights of
American and other foreign inanufactuiers In
China under the provisions ot treaties which
permit aliens to exercise their industries in
that country. On this point our own
treaty is silent, but under the ope
ration cf the most favored nation clause
we have like privileges witli those of other
powers. While it is the duty of the govern
ment to see that our citizens have lull enjoy
ment of every right by treaty, I doubt the ex
jM'diency of leading in a movement to constrain
China toadmit an interpretation of which we
had only an indirect treaty right to exact. The
transference to China of American capital for
the employment there of Chinese labor, would
in eifect inaugurate a compendium for the con
trol of tho markets now supplied by our home
industries. There is good reason to believe
that the law restricting emigration of Chinese
has been violated, or otherwise, by olllcials of
China, upon w hom Is devolved the duty of cer
tifying that the emigrants belong to the ex
cepted class. Measures have been taken to
ascertain the facts incident to the supposed in
fection, and it is believed the government of
China will co-operate with the United States
in securing the faithful observance of the law.
JAPAN.
Tho sole considerations which prompted
our Congress, at its last session,
to return to Japan tho Simonsky indemnity
seems to me to require at its bands like action
in respect to the Canton indemnity now
amounting to $:ioO,000. The question ol the
general revision of the foreign treaties of Japan
has been considered in an international con
ference at Tolkot, but without definite result.
As yet this government is disposed to concede
the requests of Japan to determine the duties
to provide such proper judicial tribunal as may
commend themselves to the western powers
for the trial of causes to foreigners and parties,
and to assimilate terms and durations of its
treaties to those of civilized states.
libebia.
Through our ministers nt London and Monro
via, this government has endeavored
to aid Liberia in its difference with Great
Britain touching the northwestern boundaries
of the republic. There is a prospect of the ad
justment of the dispute by the adoption of the
Maurali river as the line. This arrangement
is an accomplishment of the conflicting territo
rial claims and takes from Liberia no country
over which she has maintained effective juris
diction. THE CONGO COUNTRY.
The rich valley of the Congo is being opened
to commerce by a society called the Interna
tional African association, of which the king
of Belgium is president, and a citizen of the
Untied States the chief executive officer.
Large tracts of hind havo been ceded to the
association by the native chiefs. Roads have
beeu opened up, steamboats have been placed
on the river, and a nucleus of states estab
lished at twenty-two stations under one flag
wmcli oners lreeitoin to commerce and prohib
its the slave trade. The objects of this societv
sre philanthropic. It does not aim at a per
manent political control, one seeks tiie neu
trality of the Congo valley. The United
States cannot be Indifferent to this
work nor to the interests of their
citizens which are involved in it.
It may become ai visable for us to co-operate
witli other powers in promoting the rights of
t
gi
trade and residence
in uie Congo valley, tree
from interior or political control to any one

SOCIAL AND SCIENTIFIC CONGRESS.
In view of the frenuencv of Invitations from
foreiun governments to participate in a social
and scientific congress for the discussion of
nniHirtaiit matters ot general concern, 1 repeat
the suggestion of my last message that pro
vision ne inane ior 1110 exercise 01 atscreuon
ary power by the executive in appointing dele
gates to such a congress to reprtsent our na
tional interest in such a capacity without per
sonal prolit or other compensation more than
the defrayment of expenses actually incurred,
and this a comparatively small annual appro
priation would sulllce to meet.
RESTRICTIONS TO OUR TRADE.
I have alluded in a previous message to the
Injurious restrictions suffered by our trade iu
the Spanish West Indies and Brazil,
whose nature mado the outlet for
its great national product coffee,
although the Un.ted States impose a
heavy exDort duty oh that product.
Petroleum exports are hampered with in Tur
key and in other Eastern ports by restriction,
such as storages and enormous tax.
For these mischiefs adequate relief is
not always afforded by reciprocity trea
ties, like tuat with Hawaii or that lately nego
tiated with Mexico and now waiting the action
of the senate. Is it not advisable to provide
some measure of equitable retaliations with
governments which discriminate against our
own? If, for example, the executive were em
powered to supply to the Spanish vessels and
cargoes from Cuba and Porto Rico the same
rules of treatment and scale of penalties for
tropical faults which are applied to our vessels
ami cargoes in the Antilles, and resort to that
course, it might not be barren of good
results.

that for that year the receipts will exceed

cluding Uie amount to the sinking fund, hither
to surplus, as rapidly as it lm accumulated
has been devoted to the reduction of the na
tional debt. As a result the only bonds now
outstanding wtich are redeemable at the
pleasure of the government are the 3 per
cents, amounting to about 305,000.000, 4yi
per cents, amounting to 250.000,000, and
the 137,000,110 4 per cents, which are not
pavahle until 13P1 and 1907 respectively. If the
surplus shall hereafter be as large as the treas
ury now estimates, the 3 jer cent, bonds
may ail lie redeemed at least lour years before
any of the 4Vt per cents cau be called in. The
Htter, at the same rate of accumulation of sur-
nn
plus, can be paid at maturity, and the money
requisite for the redemption of the 4 per cents
1 ill be in the treasury many years before this
obligation becomes payable. There are cogent
reasons, however, why the national indebted
ness should not be thus rapidly extinguished;
chief among them is the fact that only by ex
cessive taxation is such rapidity attainable.
INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES.
In a communication to coneress at Its hist
session I recognized that all excise
taxes bo abolished except those relating to
distilled spirits, and that substantial reduc
tions should also be made in revenue from
customs. A statute has been passed bv which
the annual tax aud tariff receipts of the gov
ernment have been cut down to the extent of
fifty or sixty million dollars. While I have no
doubt that still further reductions may be wise
ly made, I dou't advise the adoption of this
session of any measures for a large diminition
of the national revenues. The result of the
legislation ol the last session of congress Las
not as yet become sufficiently apparent to
justify any radical reduction or sweeping mod
Ilicatton of existin law. In the internal reve
nue, whicli must elapse before the effects of
the act of March 3, 1883, can be definitely as
certained a portion of the surplus revenues
may be wisely applied to the long needed duty
of providing coast defences for the protection
of our harbors. This is a matter to which I shall
agi-iu advert.
THE NATIONAL CURRENCY.
Immediately associated with the financial
subject is an imortant question, on which leg
islation is needed, regarding the national cur
rency. The airirreirate amount ot bonds now on
deposit in the treasury to support the national
bank circulation is about swsn.ooo.ooo, nearly
200,000,000 of this amount consist of three per
cents., which, as the treasurer states, are pay
able at the pleasure of the government and are
likely to be called in within less than four
vears. unless in the meantime the surplus rev
enue shall be diminished. The probable effect
of such an extensive retrenchment of securities
w hich are based upon the national bank circu
lation, would be such a contraction of the vol
ume of the currency as to produce grave com
mercial embarrassment. How can the danger
be obviated? The most effectual iiIhii. and
one whose adoptioa at the e'arliest practicable
opportunity I shall heartily approve, has al
ready oeen maicatea. 11 me revenues 01 tne
next four vears shall be kept substantially
commensurate with the expenses, the volume
of circulation will not be likely to suffer
any national disturbance, but on the
other hand if there shall be great
delay iu reducing the tax, it will either be the
substitute of some other form of currency in
place ot tne national uank notes or to make im
portant chanties iu the laws bv which the cir
culation is now controlled. In my judgment
the latter course is far preferable. I commend
to your attention the very interesting and
thoiigtliful suggestions upon the subject which
appears in the secretary;s report. The objec
tions wuicu lie ures agaiusi. me acceptance 01
any other securities than the objections of Ihe
Dveriimeuii ilscu as a luuuuaiiou 101 national
ank circulation seem to me insenerable for
avoiding the threatened contraction. Two
courses have been suggested, either of which
is probably feasible. One is the issuance of
new bonds having many years to run, bearing
it low rate 01 interest, auu excnaiigeauie upon
lecinea terms oi mose now outsianaing; tne
I her course which commends itself to our judg
ment as the better, is the enactment of a law
repealing tne tax on circulation anu permitting
banks to issue nutes for au amount equal to 90
per cent of the market value, instead of as
now the face value of their deposit bonds. I
agree with the secretary in the belief that the
adoption of this plan would afford the neces
sary relief.
THE TRADE DOLLAR.
The trade dollar was coined for the purpose
of traffic in countries where silver passed at its
value, as ascertained by its weight and fine
ness. It never hao. a legal tender quality. A
large number of these coins entered, however,
into the volume of our currency by common
consent. Their circulation in domestic trade
has now closed and they have thus become a
disturbing element They should not be longer
ermitted to embarrass the currency system,
recommend that provision for their receDtion
bv the treasury and tho mints as bullion at a
small per centapte above their market price of
silver of like fairness.
CONSOLIDATING CUSTOM DISTRICTS.
The secretarv of the treasury ad
vises a consolidation of certain of
of the customs districts of the
country and suggests that the president be
vested with such power in relation thereto as
Is now given him iu respect to collectors of in
ternal revenue by section 3111 of revised stat
utes. The statistics on this subject, which are

a sLioug nrguiiieui iu ueieuse 01 111s views, at
the adjournment of congress the number of in
ternal revenue collect on districts was 126. Bv

From the report of the secretarv of war It
will be seen that in only a single instance has
there been any disturbance of the quiet condi
tion of our Indian tribes. A raid from Mexico
into Arizona bv a small nartv of Indians.
which was pursued by Gen. Crook into the
mountain regions from which it had come. It
is confidently honed that such an outbreak
will not again occur and that the Indians who
for many years have disturbed the West, will
hereafter remain in peaceable submission.
FORTIFICATIONS.
I again call vour attention to the present
condition of our extended sea coast on which
are so many large cities whose wealth and im
portance would, in time of war, suffer from
modern war ships, which our insufficient de
fensive works could give no adequate protec
tion. These works were built before the intro
duction of modern heavy rifled guns into mari
time warfare and if they are not put in an effi
cient condition we may be subjected to humili
ation by a hostile power greatly inferior to
ourselves. As germaue to this subject I call
attention to the impirtance of perfecting
our submarine torpedo defenses. The board
authorized by the last congress to report on
the method which should be adopted for the
manufacture of heavy ordnance, has
visited the principal. iron and
steel works hi this country and Europe. It is
hoped that its report will soon be made, and
that congress will thereupon be disposed to
provide suitable facilities and plans for the
manufacture of such guns as are now impera
tively needed.
STATE MILITIA.
On several occasions during the last year of
ficers of the army have, at the request of state
military authorities, visited their military en
campments for the inspection of troops. From
tne reports 01 inese oincers 1 am inaucea 10 ne
lieve the encouragement of the state imlitarv
organizations, by the national government,
would be lottowea by veiy grattiying results,
and would afford it great assistance in emer
gencies with the aid of a large body of volun
teers educated in the performance oi military
duties.
THE NAVY.
The secretary of the naw reports that under
the authority of the act of August 5, 1882, and
March 3,1883, the work of strengthening our
navy by the construction of wooden vessels has
been auspiciously begun. Three cruisers are
in process of construction the Chicago,
of 45,000 tons, and the Boston
and Atlanta each 26,000 tons. Tiiey
are to be built of steel with the tensile strength
and duribility prescribed by law, and a combi
nation of speed, endurance and armament
are expected to compare favorably with the
test uniformed vessels of other nations. A
fourth vessel, the Dolphin, is to be constructed
of similar material. It is intended to serve as
fleet dispatch boat. The double turreied
monitors Puritan. Amuhritite and Terror have
been lau iched on the Delaware river, and a
contract has been made for the supply of their
machinery. A similar monitor, tne nioaanoc.
nas neen launcnea in uaiuonua. xne uavai
advisory board and the secretary recommend
the completion of the monitors, the construc
tion of four gun boats and also of three addi
tional steel vessels iixe tne cnicago, Boston
and Dolphin as an important measure of mate
rial aetence.
WATER WAYS
The secretary urges also the immediate crea
tion of an Interior coast line of water ways
across tne penensuia 01 j-ionua,
alomr the coast from Florida to HamDton
Roads, between Cheaoeake bay and the Dela
ware river and through Cape Cod. I feel
bound to impress upon the attention of Con
tress the necessity 01 continued progress in
the reconstruction of the naw. The condition
of the public treasury, as I have intimated,
makes the present an auspicious time for put
ting this branch of service in a state of effi
ciency. It is no part of our policy to create and
maintain a navy able to cope with that of the
other great powers of the world. We have no
wish for foreign conquests, aud the peace
which we have so lone enioved is in no seem
ing danger of interruption, Dut that our naval
strength should be made adeauate for the de
fense of our harbors, the protection of our com
mercial interests ana me mainiainances 01 our
national honor, is a proposition from which no
patriotic citizen win wimnoia nis assent.
THE MAIL SERVICE.
The renort of the postmaster general con
tains a urat'.f vine exhibit ot the condition and
prospects of mat interesting branch of public
service in nis care. 11 appears mat on June
30. 1883. the whole number of post offices was
47.863. of wldch 1632 were established during
the previous fiscal year. The number of offices
operating under the system of free delivery-
was 154; at these; latter offices the postage on
local matter amounted to 419,523,052, a sum
exceedinc bv 102.189.401 the entire cost of the
carrier service of the country. The rate of
postage on drop letters passing through these
offices is now fixed by law at two cents per
half ounce or fraction thereof. In offices
where the carrier system has not been estab
lished me rate is oniy one-uau as targe. 11
will be remembered that in 1873 when free de
livery was first established bv law. the uniform
single rate upon local letters war one cent, and
so it remained until 1872, when in those
cities where the carrier service was es
tablished, it was increased in order to
defray expense of such service. It seems to
me the old rate may now with propriety be
restored and that too even at the risk ot di
minishing for a time at least the receipts iroin
postage from local letters. I can see no rea
son why that particular class of mail matter
should be held accountable for the entire cost
of not only its owu collection and delivery, but
the collection and delivery of all other classes.
and I am confident that after full considera
tion of tho subject the reduction of the rate
wonld be followed by such a growing acces
sion of business as to occasion but a slight and
temporary loss to the revenues of thepost-
ouice.
THE TELEGRAPH SYSTEM
The postmaster-general devotes much of his
report to the consideration In its various as
pects of tiie relations of the government to the
telegraphs. Such reflection as I have been
able to give on this subject since my last an
nual message, nas not lea me 10 cnimi

postmaster general that the government as

sume the control of existing telecraph lines or
to construct others with a view of entering into
a general competition wifh private enterprise.
The objections which may be justly urged
against any system which would require an
enormous increase in the civil service lists do
not, however, appear equal to some of the
p'ans winch have lately attracted public com
ment. It has been claimed, lor example, mat
Congress munt wisely authorize the postmas
ter general to contract with some private per
sons or corporation, for the transmission of
messages at specified rates aud

widely differing iu their special characteris
tics, have been susriresled ill the public uriuts.

the government should be authorized by law to
exercise some sort of supervision of inter-state
telegraph communication, and I express the
hope that for attaining that end some measure
should be adopted which will receive your ap
probation. The attoruev-eeneral criticise0, in his report

were introduced into that act from statutes
which had been passed many years previous.

In the belief that the statute should be revised
bv which these fees are regulated, so, too,

tion of district attorneys, aud of marshals.
They should be paid w holly by salaries instead
of part by tees, as is now the case. The change
would prove to be a measure of economy aud
would discourage tiie institution of needless
and oppressive legal proceedings which it is
to be feared, have, in some instances, been con
ducted for the mere sake of personal gain.
THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT.
Much Interesting and varied information is
contained in the report of the secretary of in
terior. 1 particularly can jour aie-n"ii lo
his prsesentation of certain phases of Indian
questions. His recommendations for the re
peal of the preemption and timber culture
acts and for more stringent legislation, to pre
vent frauds under tne pension laws, uie stat
utes which prescribe the definitions and pun
ishments of crimes, and relating to pensions,
will doubtless be made more effective by cer
tain amendments and additions which are
pointed out iu the secretary's report.
FEDERAL AID TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
I have previously referred to the alarming
state of Illiteracy in certain portions of the
country, and again submit for the considera
tion of Congress whether some federal aid
should be extended to pnblic primary educa
tion, wherever adequate provision therefore
have not been made.
THE MORMONS.
The Utah commission has submitted to the
secretary of the interior its second an
nual report. As a report of its labors in
that territory pursuant to the act ot the nrst
of March it appears the persons by that act
disqualified to the number of about 12,000 were
excluded from the polls. This fact, however,
affords little cause for congratulation, and I
fear that it is far from indicating any real and
subtantial progress toward the extirpation of
polygamy. All of the members of the legisla
ture are Mormons, mere is grave reason to
believe they are in sympathy with the prac
tices that this government is seeking to sup
press, and that its effort in that regard will be
more likely to encounter their opposition thau
to receive meir encouragement auu support.
Even if this view should happily be unfounded
the law under which the Utah commissioners
have been acting should be made more effect
ive by the incorporation of some such string
ent measures as were included in bill No. 2238
on the calender of the Senate at its last session.
I am convinced, however.polyganiy has become
so strongly entrenched in the territory of
Utah that it is profitless to attack with any
but the stoutest weapons which the constitu
tional legislation can fashion. I favor there
fore a repeal of the act upon which the exist
ing government depends and the assumption
bv the national legislature of the entire polit-
cal control in the territory and the establish
ment of a commission witli such powers and
duties as shall be delegated to it by law.
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.
The department of agriculture is accomplish
ing much in the direction of the agricultural
ueveiopment 01 tne country, anu tue report 01
the commissioner giving the results of his in
vestigation and experiments will be found in
teresting and valuable. At his instance a con
ventionof those interested in the cattle indus
try was latel v held at Chicago. The prevalence
of pleuro-piieumonia and other contagious d s-
eases 01 animals was one 01 tne ciuei topics 01
discussion. A commission of the convention
will invite your co-operation in this investiga
tion of the causes of diseases and providing
methods for their prevention aud cure.
ALASKA.
I trust that Congress will not fail at the pres
ent session to put Alaska under the protection
of law. Its people have repeatedly remon
strated against our neglect to afford them the
maintenance and protection, expressly guar
anteed byterus of the treaty whereby that
territory was ceded to the United States. For
sixteen years they have pleaded iu vain fw
that which they should have received without
the asking. They have no law for the collec
tion of debts, the support of education, the
conveyance of property, the administration of
estates, or enforcement of contract; 110 law for
punishment of criminals, except such as are
offered by certain customs of the country and
navigation. The resources of Alaska, especial
ly in furs, mines and timber, are
considerable in extent and capable
of large developments, while its geographical
situation is one of political and commercial
tmimrtauce. The protection of Intei est there
in e :ts well as considerations of honor and
good faith demand the Immediate establish
ment ol civil government hi that territory.
RAILWAY LEGISLATION.
ComDlaints have lately b-?en numerous and
agents controlling a whole or a part of the
facilities for the inter-state carriage of persons
and merchandise for the great railways of the
country have resorted in the dealing with the
public to diverse measures unjust and oppres
sive iu their character. In some instances the
state government have attached and oppressed
these evils, but in others jthey have been
unable to afford adequate relief because of the
jurisdictional limitations which are imposed
on them by the federal constitution. The
question how far the national government may
lawfully Interfrre in the premises, and what, if
aliy, supervision or contract it ought to exercise

tance of the vast railway system in its great

poration ought to be interested in the absolute
power over the interests of any citizen or class
of citizens. The rights of these rati way com
panies to award and profitable returns upon
their investments and to reasonable freeuom
in their regulations must be economized, but it
seems only just that so far as its constitutional
authority will permit, Congress should protect
the people at large in their state traffic against
acts of injustice which the state governments
are powerless to prevent.
PROTECTION OF THE FORESTS.
Tn mwlast annual messatre I called attention
to the necessity of protectiug by suitable legis
lation the forests situated on public domain.
In a great many portions 01 tne west
the pursuit of general agriculture is
only made practicable by resort to irrigation,
While successful irrigation would be impossi
ble without aid afforded by the forest in con
tributing to the regular ana constant suppiy
of water. During the past year severe suffer
ing and great loss of property nas Deen occa
sioned by profuse floods, f llowed by periods
of unusually low water in many of the great
rivers of tne country. The3e irregularities
were in a great measure caused by removal
irom aoout tne sources 01 me rivers, 01 innoci
hv which th water snnnlv had been nourished
and protected. The preservation of such por
tion of forests on the national domain, as es
sentially contribute to the flow of important
water courses, are of the highest importance.
The important tributaries of the Missouri,
Columbia and the Saskatchevan rie in
t.hfl mountains ot Montana, near me norm
ern boundary of the United States,
between the Blackfoo and Rathead Indian
reservation. This region is unsuitable for
commerce, but on the rivers which flow from
it rinnnnris the future airricultural development
of a vast tract of country. The attention of
Congress is called to the necessity of witli
drawimr from nubile sale this part of the pub
lic domain and establishing there a forest

INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITIONS.
The industrial exhibitions which have been
held in the United States during the present
year have attracted attention in many foreign
countries, where the announcements of these
enterprises nave Deen maae Known uirouKu

CIVIL SERVICE.
The commissioners who were appointed nn
der act of January 16, 1883, entitled "an act to
regulate and improve the civil service of the
United States," entered promptly on the dis
charge of their duties. A series of rules were
framed in accordance with the spirit of the
statutes, and approved and promulgated by
the president.

civil service commission, whie i itl soon be
subuutted to Congress, will d- it'less afford
the means of a more detuiitw v ent than I
am now prepared to expressW-s to the merits
of the new system. I am persuaded that its
effects havetlius far proven beneficial. Its prac
tical methods appear to be adequate for tho
ends proposed and there has been no serious
ilitlieullies in carrying them iuto effect. Since
theethof July last 110 person, hs far as I am
av.t're, h;us been appointed to public servic
in tiie classified portions thereof Iu any of the
departments or at any of the postotliees and
custom districts above named, except they
were certified by the commissioner to be the
mivt competent. The basis of all examinations
were had in conformity of rules.
PRESIDENTIAL SUCCESSOR.
At the time when the present executive en
tered uK)ii the duties. Ills death, resignation or
inability to discharge the duties of office, it
would have left the government without a con
stitutional head. It is possible of course that
a similar contingency may again arise unless
the wisdom of Congress shall provide against
its recurrence. The Senate at its last session,
af ter full consideration, passed an act relating
to tills subject which will now, I trust,
commend itself to the approval of
both houses of Congress. The
clause of the constitution upon which
must depend on any law regulating the presi
dential succession and present also Ior solu
tion oilier questions of paramount importance.
These questions relate to the proper interpre
tation of the phrase iu ability to discbarge, to
powers and duties of said officer. Our organ
ic law providing when the president shall suf
fer from such inability the presidential office
shall devolve upon the vice president, who
must himself, nnder like circumstances, give
place to such office as Congress may by law
apioint to act as president. I need not here
set forth numerous and Interesting inquiries
which is suggested by the werds of the consti
tution; they were fully stated in my first mes
sage to Congress and have since been
the subject of frequent deliberation of
that body. It is now to be hoped
these momentous questions will find
speedy solution, lest emergence may arsse
w hen longer delay will be impossible hnd any
determination albeit the wise may furnish any
cause for anxiety for reasons fully stated in
my last annual message.
THE VETO POWER.
I repeat my recommendation that congress
propose an amendment to that provision of the
constitution which prescribed the enactment
of the formalities for the enactment of laws
whereby iu respect to bills for the application
of public moneys, the executive may be en
abled, while giving his approval to particular
items, to interpose ids veto as to such others as
do not conimeud themselves to his judgment.
THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT.
The fourteenth amendment to the constitu
tion confers the rights of citizenship on all per
sons born or naturalized in the United States
and subject to the jurisdiction thereof. It
was the Sjjecial purpose of this amend
ment to insure to members of the
colored race the full enjoyment of civil and
political rights. Certain statutory provisos in
tended to secure the enforcement of these
rights, have been recently declared unconstitu
tional by the Supreme Court. Any legislation
whereby Congress may lawfully supplement
the Kuarantee which the constitution affords
for the equal enjoyment by all the citizens of
the United States of every right, privilege and
immunity of citizenship, will receive my un
hesitating approval.

New York, Dec 4. Chas. D.Gil-

000 damages against Carl Schnrz in
the supreme court, this city. Gilmour
was formerly a practicing lawyer in
Washington and alleges that when
Schurz was secretary of the interior,
in 1880, he maliciously, and by the ex
ercise ot arbitrary authority, had the
plaintiff debarred and prohibited from
practicing in any of the departments
of the interior, where, Gilmour alleges,
he had a practice of $1500 a year. The
suit was removed to-day to the United

PECCLlAiai A TEXAS CEAZE
All things, now new under the sub,
take unto themselves a period of fash-y
ion. Base ball has its run, tho craze
having marched its army of followers
up hill with flying colors, while it nbw
begins to march down again. Things
unknown a year or two ago are nbw
all the rage. . A shallow pated Eng
lish fool, without form or beauty,
wore a sunflower as an ornament, find
in less than six months every fop j in
the land had a sunflower in the lapbel
of his coat. Colors have their rase:
and so do flowers. The chrysanthe
mum craze has now two continent in
its grasp.while every pretty girl in iu
rope and America wears the jauntv
(derby) jacket. Even crimes have
their period of fashion, and
sometimes have been known to
assume the relation of a
craze. Incindiarism often has it3
period of prevalence; robbery becomes,
at times a thing of every day occur
rence. Even murder takes in periods
of prevalence.and the hand that strikes
to-day presents a pashion to bo
followed to-morrow. Tho most re
cent craze in critna is fenco cutting.
The first man who applied the nippers
to a wire fence is unknown, but
the thing, like magic, when once be
gun, spread from one end of Texas to
the other. It is a Texas institution,
inaugurated in 1883. and destined to
occupy the widest range while civil
authority is loosely exercised. It took
like fire takes an untrodden prairie in
dry weather, and, no matter where it
began, it has swept with devastating
effect over Texas. As long as pres
ent material last3 it will exist. A
legislature has been called to check
it, but with the same officers
that now control the execution of
law the legislature with all its sta
tutes will be powerless. Jt is grown
into a craze and will have its run. It
is getting just as natural now to cut
a barbed wire as it is to want to eat.
It is only necessary for one to look at
a barbed wire for the craze to seize
him. A peaceable and lawabidlng cit
izen, going down Pecan street, has his
fingers begin to work like a pair of
nippera as he passes those stacks of
wire at Firebaugh's. He would just
like to try a cut, and were he in the
country.beside one of those long strings
of wire fences, he would speedily bo a
fenco cutter. This craze is nothing
more nor less than the presence for a
season of Satan in the confines of Tex
as. The spirit of the devil has taken
hold of people, and the fence is dese
crated around the homes of the dead
as well as around the ranges of the
long-horns. Why this one fence cu t-
ter, who was convicted Travis
county, did not plead mental insanity
is not understood. The devil took
possession of him, and intuitively
he cut, just like the madman, who
thirsts for human blood, would brain
a helpless babe. Fence-cutting is a
fearful crime. Some say it should be
expiated in the penitentiary under a
sentence of ten years; some say a life
time, while the Waco Examiner urges
it be made a capital offense. So
ciety, when is overtaken with these
crazes, is weak, and therefore suscep
tible; communities that take on any
criminal craze is possessed of an inate
immorality that is fond of lawless
ness. Two elements combine to create
morbid desire for crime one being
possessed of the desire to commit
crime, the other to induce crime.
This is the condition that has led to
the prevalence of fence-cutting. A
lawless element was ready to insult
law and order; another offered the in.
centive; and so the nippers were started
by lawless men as a means of retalia
tion on the lawless. The evil begun,
it has spread until the present entire
military power of the United States
would be found inadequate-to deal
with it. Wires are cut around the large
pastures; they are cut around small
farms; they.are cut around residence
enclosures, and gravo yard3, even, do
not produce ghosts enough to frighten
"nesters" away. . Fence cutting
was started, so we where
informed by the military
department of the state government,
mostly to open ways to water, aud it
was announced that the end of the
drouth had put an end to fence cut
ting. This declaration was made the
subject of ridicule by lawless men,
who thereupon redoubled their efforts
to destroy property. Kich and poor,
the strong and the weak, men and
widows and orphaned children are at
tacked alike, and even the winds that
have played silently over graves
have been made lively with
the strike of the nippers and the tone
of the falling wires. Law is insulted,
and it is predicted it will be insulted
even after the legislature makes fence
cutting a felony. The officers who
fail to catch the law breaker now will
fail to hunt him down then. This
lawless condition will prevail until
the moral disease runs its course.
Fortunately for its duration the evil
has become a craze, and it will the
sooner reach its end through the ab
surdities and excesses of it3 own exis
tence.
, IU TEE-STATE COaJttEKCE.
Mr. Beagan announces his pur
pose to push his inter-state commerc
bill. He is satisfied the measure wii
have fair consideration this winter,
because he can now have a fair com
niittee, not one packed against him aa
was the case under the administration
of Keifer. He insists he has been
much misrepresented; that he is not
against the railways but is simpH
against wrong, and is trying to pre
vent the railroads from doing wrongi
that he fully recognizes the value o
the railroads in the development of the
South and the West; but that this isj
no reason for permitting them to ex
ercise a tyrannical and arbitrary pow
er of discrimination. He says his In
terstate commerce measures does not
seek to regulate the rate paid for the
freight and passenger traffic of the
country, bui to prevent extortion and
make the roads charge a uniform rate
to every one for equal service. The
constitution, he thinks, clearly gives
the power to Congress to regulate inter-state
commerce, and that is all the
bill proposes to cover. Discriminating
1 rates and treatment when entirely
within the states must be left to the
tates to remedy. "It nasi been
aid," says Jur. jtteagan," in oppo
ition to my plan: ' How can
ou tell which is which without in
ning the danger of serious delays?"
y answer to that is very simple. The
ck of the bill of shipment tells all
that is necessary to be known. The
trouble with all state legislation upon
the subject in the past has been the
msuOicient means furnished for the
punishment for violating tho laws
passed. My bill provides punishment;
of a severe character, and in some
cases imprisonment. I further guard
against the intimidation of the poor
people, or those loath to fight corpo-!
rations, by giving the United States i
tiistrict attorneys power to proceed
igamst roads upon information." The
Statesman has not been so sure as
lr. Reagan that his bill is not uncon
titutional; and it s quite sure that
ts tendency is to lay violent hands on
lhe nghts of states. i)
1 HOMESTEADS FOB '
The ppenmg of the Indian Terri
tory to white settlement is not a mat
ter of immediate necessity, and we do
not think Congress will be disposed
to legislate at once in behalf of such
purpose. It can not be denied, how
ever, that the policy of herding the
Indians together in reservations con
tiguous to each other has been a wise
one. It would be far better to put
tho Indians on the same footing us
the homestead settler. Force the dif
ferent tribes to make their selections
of homes on unappropriated domain,
and make the head of each family ao
quire title on the same conditions as
other actual settlers. The propo
sition has been made to
give each head of a family
one section of land, but why the Inr
dian should bo given preference
over all other settlers Is not under
stood. It might be well for Congress.
if the purpose be to place all the un
settled Indiana in the Indian territory,
to provide for their settlement there
within a given time, say five years
The best plan would be to sequestrate
the lands, not giving them to tribes
but to individuals, and require all to
make selections of homesteads within
that time. Let it be understood that
after five years they would be given
no more lands, but that they would
then bo allowed to acquire them
in no other way than by pur
chase. The Indian bureau is a
heavy item of expense to the govern
ment, and its early abolition ought to
be contemplated. By settling the In-
dians in a given time on homesteads,
not reservations, the surplus lands
now set apart for tribes could then be
opened to settlement for whites. Of
course, where the government has
parted with title to large bodies of
lands to tribes, the sales or contracts
should be respected. The right
of eminent domain, even in
such cases, might bo , resurttd
to, and the Indians, after being forced
to take homesteads, could be paid for
lands condemned. These condemned
lands could then be placed at the ilis
position of whites. .We do not be
lieve in dealing too hastily with the
Indians, but the government has been
dilly dallying with them to long and
should place a limit of time when
their relations of the government
should be . definitely settled. Five
years is long enough. At that time
the Indian territory might be opened
for settlement, and until it is opened
Texas will not be the looser by its
being closed against white settlers.
There is no end to faiths,
the last . claiming attention be
ing the Faithists, who held
a meo ng in New York a' few
days ago. There were 100 delegates
present, representing eleven states.
They claim to accept all that is good
in all faiths Christianity, Judaism,
Islamism, Brahminism, and Confu
cianism. Their particular creed is said
to be founded on the book of
"Oahspe," which, they say, is a direct
revelation from heaven, received
through the medium of a type-writer,
700 copies of which they have sold at
$7.50 each. Their plan is to reform
the world by taking children into
their communities and raising them
up in purity away from the tempta
tions of life. The Faithists are also
vegetarians.
A Washington special to the
New York Herald says:: "The
report comes from Now York
that Mr. Tilden very recently
called to him some of his
closest political friends and formally
discharged them from further service
to himself. It Is asserted, on what
seems to be good authority, that the
old gentleman has definitely given up
not only all purpose of political ad
vancement for himself, but also all
attempts to exercise the influence he
undoubtedly has in tho party for the
advancement of others. If this re
port may be trusted, he has bidden a
cheerful but definite and complete
good-bye to politics."
Toe anticipated attempt to count
out some of the Virginia state sena
tors was not made. The returning
board acted squarely, not going out
side the original returns, but per
forming its functions merely as a min
isterial body. The beaten Keadjuster
candidate for senator in the Danville
district tried to get in a contest, but
his impudence was not rewarded.
The boss now seems to have no one
so low as to do his bidding. The
Democrats in the legislature will have
24 majority on joint ballot.
Correspondence between Wash
ington and the City of Mexico is said
to be going on, with a view of having
the president of the United States and
the president of the Mexican republic
meet upon the international bridge,
which spans the Eio Grande, half way
between El Paso and Paso del Norte,
on the 5th of May, Mexican independ
ence day. The occasion will be in
onor of the completion of the Mexi
can central railway, and the conse
quent linking of the capitals of the
wo republics with iron rails.
The president's message, delivered

poisonous trail luiligestibie trash
which in these ilays is forced upon
(pie public as genuine loot!, or used to
; adulterate those articles that go to

household. Our forefathers were con
lent to make money by plain and
honest methods; but the hot competi
tion of the present day ar.d tlw strife
for rapid riches have called forth all
the ingenuity of inoi'ern science to
devise eunnirg deceptions that shall
enable the avaricious dealer to more
rapidly increase his profits, even
though he destroy tho health of the
public thereby. The consequence is
adulterated, impure, poisonous and
bogus iood on every n;md.
The people buy these aduiteratta
articles ot food because they are
cheap, entirely ignorant of their pois
onous qualities. A lew years ago
this evil had reached such alarming
proportions in KDglaud that the pub
lic sentiment demanded legislative in
terference, aud parliament enacted
the most severe repressive laws. .ur.
Small, U. S. A., after an examination
recently made under tho directiou of
the war department, concludes that
the adulteration of food is as great
in this countrv to-dav. and of as dan
gerous a character, as it was in Ellw
and at tho time reicrreu io. jno ur-
ticle entering so generally into the
food of every launiy has been iounu
more villainously adulterated than
baking powder. For the purpose of
underselling an absolutely pure pow
der liko the "Itoyal" which has be
come tho standard for purity and
strength in baking powders hun
dreds of dealers are putting up baking
powders with cheap and adulterated
cream of tartar containing lime, earth,
etc., adding strength by the free use of
alum. These powders aro sold cheap,
but their use in extensive, for they aro
one of the chief causes of tho dyspep
sia from which the American people
are suffering. This species of adultera
tion, at least, can be avoided by fol
lowing the advice of Prof. MoU, tho
chemist to the government, who rec
ommends customers "vnen purchas
ing baking powders to select onu
standard powder, as tho '.Royal Bak
ing Powder.' niftier than to risk pur
chasing adventurous compounds put
upon the marker; oy persons wuu
have no higher motive than dollars
and cent;?."
We hope to see Congress take how
of this important matter in a suai-
ciently viguious manner io pur. au
end to the whole nefarious business.
In the moan time, if people will ba
as careful to buy the best and pu ibt
food as they are to wear the best
clothes and build the most comfort
able houses, it will not bo necessary
to ask so frequently the question,
"Why are we sick?" Every scientific
test has proven tho "Jloyal' to be pure
