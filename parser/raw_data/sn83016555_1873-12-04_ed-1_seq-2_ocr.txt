MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT.
In regarding this document as a whole
it illustrates the extraordinary growth of
a country whose system of government is
preferred by the flocking millions of
Europe to their own. At the same time
its example reflected across the ocean has
induced the peoples to assimilate their
own systems to ours. The admirable
style and tone of the message is due to
the personal judgment of the President,
its author. It demonstrates, 1. That an
unambitious citizen elevated to public
confidence by a masterly command of
great opportunities, may qualify himself
for the capable discharge of all the duties
which the highest office may cast upon
him. It requires, then, no hereditary
despot nor tutelary ministers to conduct
the affairs of a powerful nation. The
message is a vc-ry extraordinary refuta
tion of the semi-alien press, that Gen
eral Grant was an ambitious soldier,
only intent on ripening the power con
ferred by a grateful nation into a dynasty
descending to his personal lineage. Every
line of the message is replete with respect
for the limitation of the law, the wishes
of the people, aud the permanence of the
republic. He wishes American citizen
ship so defined that it may not be taken
to foreign countries as a passport and ex
emption. He affirms the right of the citi
zen to the same protection on the ship as.
on the shore of the nation, and that any
iuvasion of that sanctuary by a foreign
power is "in derogation of the sov
ereignty of the United States." He de
sires the mode ot electing to executive
office shall be made more popular; pro
poses imeud i • i;» by which the abuses of
legislation -L». .« corrected and the po
litical patr o- •>., executive dimin
ished. Sc- • . economy are pointed
out. public eumution is recommended, a
guarantee of the liberties of the enfran
chised eommeuded, measures suggested for
the better compensation of labor by reduced
cost of conveying its products, as well as
by appreciating the medium which it re
ceives in exchange for its toils. The tax
of transportation aud of currency broker
age he would reduce or extinguish. With
• an adequate maintenance of the national
defenses by sea and land, he has no jars
of domestic disturbance. That he has
none of the weak apprehensions of the
ancient usurpers, is shown by his recom
mendation of an absolute and unquali
fied political amnesty. "No possible dan
ger can accrue to the government by
restoring them (all the disfranchis
ed) to elegibilily to office." Even
the temporary toleration of Spanish
iniquity grows out of a respect for
the robes of republicanism, even when
worn to disguise human bondage, and the
President incurs the impatience of the
people when he might aggrandize his
own powers by an immense military
movement. This at least shows him no
Ciesar. It proves an innate respect for
the institutions of his own country aud a
desire that they shall be planted effect
ually abroad.
These comments are made in no spiri*
of adulation. We may proceed, subse
quently, to comment upon the various rec
ommendations of the message with the
freedom that becomes a fearless friend of
the administration and of republican prin
ciples. These comments relate but to the
philosophy of the message. It indicates
ability, patriotism, a sincere confidence in
the perpetuity of our ius;itutions, and a
determination to demonstrate a love of
country rising far above the selfish ambi
tiou to promote personal interest at the
cost of national degradation.
a
OUR COMMERCIAL ANTAGONISTS.
As the fog of federal politics begins to
lift we perceive that the exclusive devo
tiou of our part of the South to that highly
exciting game, federal office, has caused a
neglect of our material interests. Wehave
never known :• man devote his time to
outside amusements tlia* he did not find
"his crop in the grass" whenose* lie h*t)
time to look after it.
The commeutators on the President's
message complain that he has said nothin,
of Louisiana affairs. What could he have
said to-have pleased his critics? They de
nounce the North, the government, and
even their own fellow citizens who do not
obey their orders like spaniels.
Hut, in the mean time, our commercial
rivals cultivate sectional amities, and re
ceive federal aid for their local interests.
While a fighting line is here drawn be
tween the Fusiouites and all who do not
obey them, elsewhere, people confiuc
their political strife to election times,
aud at other seasons unite in promoting
the comiuoik interests By which «11 who
labo», live.
We have » speech from Horn Mr.
Prince, of New York, on fhe subject of
transportation. Unfortunately, we do
not know Lis politics. Me remarked
tbat—
As a member of the New Vork Legisla
tore it was his business to look alter the in
terests ami sustain the supremacy el' New
York city, which must depend at present
upon increased transportation, since in this
way alone could the trade w ith the Vest be
sustained.
After* asserting that New York should
sustain Bej supremacy, 3Ir. Prince points
out the vain* of the «oeuuence to Be ton
tended fits:
During the year t*7" ttioveeeipts of (Tour
and grain from the iuterior at the various
seaboard ports of the country, including
Montreal, reached the *a»t aggregate of
108,430,552 busuels.
Of this New Or lean* handled of »li
grains less than ten million bushels. But
the competifois tor this hade ale «Lus
noted:
Baltimore has put forth her endeavor* bv
the building of tlie Baltimore and Ohio
railroad and the improvement of the Cum
berland canal: Philadelphia, by extending
the connections oi the Pennsylvania Pen"
tral railroad throughout both the North
west and the Southwest. New Orleans en
joys the advantage of a natural water com
munication, extending through the whole
interior of the continent, embracing the
great valleys ot the Mississippi, the Mis
souri and the Ohio. Canada stands in an
almost similar position as regards the coun
try drained by th# great lakes, and is dis
playing most commendable energy and de
termination in overcoming the natural ob
stacles at Niagara and the St. Lawrence
rapids to the direct shipment of Western
products through her own dominion from |
It
the la^es to the Atlantic
New England is also sq appljcaat fyj I
the local distribution of this grain, but
Mr. Prince Bays:
The greatest danger was to be feared
from Montreal because of the advantages
of her geographical position. He referred
to the efforts being made by the Canadians
to complete canals capable of bearing ves
sels having a tonnage of 1000 to the sea
board. and said when these works were
completed, there would be no longer any
reason that a single bushel of grain should
come to this port over and above what
might be required for home consumption;
and if we should lose the export trade, a
vast amount of other business would be
taken away also. «
We wish our readers to note well this
statement. Jt is literally true, since the
St. Lawrence offers • nearer, cheaper,
shorter aud more capacious way to Liver
pool than does the Erie and Hudson canal.
But why should not New York, who will
not "get :» single bushel of grain" as
against the kit. Lawrence, aid te open
the Mississippi? With the first freeze she
would control the whole grain trade until
the spring, aud after that would have a
line competing with her greaf rival. W
would reecommend our suarlers at the
President's message te> cease gnawing at
that file, and see if they can not put their
strength to some more useful purpose.
I util they display » little more dis
position to conciliate those from whom
they can alone expect assistance,
can not be surprising that no
thusiasw iu them or fheir projects
is exhibited either by the government or
the people of other sections. It may be
pleasant to abuse a little local power, but
when it is followed by an indignant con
tempt on the part of those infinitely more
powerful, it ceases to be so advantageous.
A skipper w ho has been cursing a nd ropes
ending everybody on board a fishing
smac-k, becomes extremely small potatoes
when he comes on the deck of a man-ol
war. It is to be apprehended that the
F usion fire eaters feel among the represen
tatives of the thirty-nine millions a good
deal like a sardine in the maw of a whale.
Surrender, gentlemen, come home aud
aid in defeating the common antagonists
who profit by our dissensions.
A StTTLED QUESTION.
The President has said nothing about
the Louisiana question, aud r.ll Eusiou
dom—we beg pardon —"/a population
blanche Je la Louisiane" is distressed and
mortified. We do not know bow many
tiler-, are of them who expected the chief
magistrate to lengthen out his message
and occupy the time of Congress with a
dissertation on post mortem subjects; but
evidently a small number looked for soine
thing ot the kind. Probably the Picayune
expected that the antics cf our Fusionists
during the past year occupied as much of
the President's attention as they do of its
own, and that he could not write a dozen
sentences, much less a dozen columns
without touching upon the subject which
engrosses all its thoughts to the exclusion
of live matters.
There is a decided difference between
the President and the Picayune. The
tormer thinks the Louisiana question
settled and the case closed, while the
Picayune insists upon treating it as a
running sore. The President has no sug
gestions to make to Congress on the sub
ject, nor any information to lay before it
in our ease. Ail that remained to be done
before the House passed Butler's resolu
tion was to decide upou the claims of our
members to seats in the two houses,
aud the constitution does not specially
authorize the President to give
advice in such cases. He, therefore
wisely refrained. His own action iu the
premises has been confined to enforcing
the laws. In case any member of Con
gress is so ignorant as not to know what
that action was, and cares to '>e informed,
he can easily ask for information, which
he can easily ask for information, which
will doubtless be cheerfully furnished. At
present there is no controversy of any
kind pending between Louisiana aud the
United States. The warrior statesman
who now holds fhe helm found her wan
dering about in a half demented condition
a few yews ago, but he secured her at
Appomattox, and she has since been com
mitted to The care of her friends—the
stalwart sons of the soil, the free voters
and the producers who belong here.
There has been several attempts on the
part ot « limited number of lunatics to
break out again. These have been hap
pily defeated, and their frantic but im
potent wriggling« do not constitute "»
ease. "
We are at a loss to know what the Pica
yicne would have the President say oa the
subject that would be appropriate on such
an occasion and would be truthful and at
the same time satisfy the irrepressible Fu
sionists. If he were to inform Congress
that he had taken measures to sustain the
Kellogg government that would be a rire
soute repetition, as he has already done
this. It he were to ask the Legislature to
reverse his decisions and try the MeEuerv
government for a year or two, that would
be inconsistent, and hardly in accordance '
with his «executive duties. If Lv- were to <
intimate the fropriety of admitting Mc
Millen to a seat in the Senate or Messrs.
Gibson, Sheridan, etc., to seats in the
House, it would l»e dictation, and afford
the Picayune a tine opportunity to revive
its little scare about "Cassarism.'* I; Le
were to ask • 'ongress to order a new rice*
tion in Louisiana ho would disregard nu
merous decisions «f ouv Supreme * ourt
that a sufficient election had already been
held ami the result g,. .perly proclaimed
by State authority, in short, we know of
nothing ke could say on the subject that
would please the Picayune and at the
same time not be ridiculous.
But it is a Jittle hard cu our Fusion*
ists that They have not been able to Lully
the President into giving them even a
passing notice. Their importance has
been so much exaggerated by themseives
that they fondly hoped it reacted cut to
Washington, aud pervaded tire executive '
mansion, the balls of Congress, and
formed the staple subject of the président'»
meditations. Hence their disappointment
upon discovering their own insignificance.
It they will make up their tninJs to ac
cept the silence of the President as a hint
that their case is closed, and The Louisi
ana question settled for this time at least,
they will find it greatly to their *dv*n
tage, a* weU as for tbe peace a«d fcappj.
ness of the good people whom they now
somewhat annoy.
BY WAY OF VARIETY.
Captious persons have often remarked
that there is a suspicious uniformity in
the telegraphic dispatches that appear in
the morning papers iu the large cities, and
that New Orleans affords no exception to
the rule. Why this is thus, or whether it is
so at all generally, is not at present our
purpose to inquire or explain. We mere
ly wish To put it upon record, for the ben
efit of tbose'who like a little variety iu the
manner of relating the same circumstances
by different parties, that an occasional
departure from the monotony complained
of is occasionally indulged in by some of
the city dailies here, at least. For in
stance, the agent of the Associated Press at
Washington, ou Tuesday night, sent the
following dispatch, which found sufficient
favor in the Republican office to be re
ceived and published without alteration:
The proceedings to-day were not encour
aging to the Fusionists of Louisiana, though
the leal issue was dodged, aud, by Butler's
own statement, he championed the bill
which seated Sheldon and Sypher, but did
not claim a de jure government for Louis
iana. Sypher, Sheldon aud Pinchback were
named in the resolution. A separate vote
was demanded, aud upon reaching Piuch
back the House adjourned.
The Times, with a wholesome fear of
the consequences of employing the Herald's
pef name for the modern Democracy, aud
not having » convenient substitute at
hand, publishes the opening sentence thus:
The proceedings to day were not encour
aging to the anti-Republican voters of Louis
iana, etc.
The italics, denoting the emendation,
are ours. But the Picayune-docs not stop
at changing the phraseology of the re
porter. It actually changes the meaniuj
aud introduces a new element, one not in
the minds of those' who sent the dispatch
It will not be limited by any pent up
terms, nor admit an interest iu any aggre
gation of individuals capable of being
circumscribed into a small space. So
substitutes a dispatch of an entirely dif
ferent meaning:
The proceedings
a
The proceedings ro day were not encour
aging to the while people of Louisiana,
though the real issue was dodged, aud by
Butler's own statement he championed the
hill which seated Sheldon and Sypher. hut
did not claim a de jure government lor
Louisiana. Sypher, Sheldon and Pinch
were named in the resolution; a separate
vote was demanded, and upon reaching
Pinch the House adjourned.
Oar italics again.
The Be" adopts the
style of the Picayune, and informs " la
•opulotion blanche de la Louisiane" that the
congressional proceedings of Tuesday
contained nothing encouraging to them.
Now we consider here 'is sufficient
variation to please any one not entirely
addicted to antitheses m cadence, though
we tear that truth has been sacrificed for
the sake of sound. At all events we have
a sort of mixed verdict that the "Fusion
ists of Louisiana," the "ante-Kepubliean
voters." the white "people," and "/a
population blanche <le la Louisiane" are con
sidered convertible terms by some of our
contemporaries who are at present osten
ibly engaged iu keeping their readers
well, advised of the current matters of the
day.
NEW ORLEANS AS A BASE.
A New York correspondent at Washing
ton gives the following estimate of the
comparative advantages of New Orleans
and New York as the base of fitting out
any foreign expeditions in the waters of
the Gulf or Caribbean sea:
The consultations held to-day between tho
istingiiishi-il military officiais of the gov
ernment. had special reference to the most
xpeditions aud effective method of organ
izing the army and its base of operations
here is a difference of opinion iu regard
to the best point of departure tor the trims
ports. New Orleans has the advantage of
contiguity to tho island and abundant lacili
ties for storage of military supplies. New
York possesses greatsr means of transpor
tation. being the principal centre of rlie
steam carrying trade of the United States:
hut during the winter season the pjissag
front New York to Havana is delayed and
endangered by the tempestuous weather to
be encountered in rounding Cape Hattcras,
while adverse weather is almost unknown
in the gulf. A patrolling fleet in Florida
channel would aflord sufficient protection
to transports starting from New Orleans,
while on the long voyage from New Y ork
they would be iu constant jeopardy of be
ing overtaken by some fast sailing cruiser
To this it may beadded that the cost of
delivering men, and also provisions, horses
or any other Western supplies would be
much less »t New Orleans than at New
Y ork. The cost of taking freights or pas
sengers between New Orleans and the
West would he obviously less from this:
The rime and cost of transportation be
tween Chicago, St. Louis or Cincinnati
aud the gulf shipping would be on the
way to w here it was wanted, while if sent
to New York for exportation it would be
out of the way by the distance between
the West and New York. Thus from Chi
cago to New York may he stated at nine
hundred miles by rail From Chicago to
New Orleans may be put down at the
same distance. A freight intended for
use oft the island of Cuba would at New
Y'ork he thirteen hundred miles from its
destination; at New Orleans six hundred
and fifty miles. The .whole distance trav.
ersed on the ouo route would be tw utv
two hundred miles, i* the other fifteen
hundred and fifty mites. This would
effect *ti immense saving in transpottation
By the iuboArd over the coastwise «oute.
The other arguments have Been properly
stated by the military authorities quoted.
The importance ot making New Orleans a
base cf military equipment aud naval
supply in tfce event of a conflict iu conti
nental waters can not he ton highly ap*
predated by our dealer* in all commodi
ties lu he affected by such au event.
While fyesideut Giant was «tnittiug
any mention of the Louisiana question iu
his teceut able message to Congress, Le
also forgot to sound the alarm bell about
the Ozark. Governor Kellogg's ".irmy
and navy may Lave frightened the souls
of tearful adversaries on Camp and (»rav ic-r
streets, in New Orleans, but "the mau at
the other $ad of the avenue" did not even
give them a passing notice. This will
probably be taken as afuif vindication of
the jcbel democracy in their successful
cheating of Graut cut of the electoral
vote of figs State in 186$ and 18?2.
