XEW YORK. Dec. 5. With the irans
ait ton of the President's message to Con
gress all doubts and misgivings heretofore
entertained by Wall Street were practically
removed. There was, to be sure, some lin
gering dtaqaietude regarding the Presi
dent's remarks and suggestions upon the
question of large industrial combinations,
bat Wall Street learned that, as usual, it
had overestimated the bearing of this por
tion of the President's message. Apart
from this clause the message was received
with unqualified commendation, particular
ly those sections relating to the currency
aad to the national finances generally. It
should be added, however, that the in
fluence of the message upon the day's mar
ket we negative.
Prior to its publication the dealings were
in very light volume and subsequently
there was no material increase in anima
tion. The tone of the market was distinct
ly heavy and there were very few excep
tions to the general tendency. Pacific Mail
wa comparatively strong on the Presi
dent's recommendations regarding the sub
sidisation of the merchant .marine, and
United States Leather common also showed
comparative firmness. Declines elsewhere
in the market, however, which extended
from fractional limits to round figures,
were the rule. Apparently the greater part
of the selling was induced by apprehen
sions of renewed monetary stringency, and
the day's call money market ruled well
above the traditional legal rate of interest
during the greater part of the day. Some
degree of discrimination in extending ac
commodation was also noticeable on the
part of the lenders.
The large array of magnificent traffic re
turns for the last week of the month pub
lished this morning were virtually without
any effect upon either the general market
or particular stocks. Among the most note
worthy showings were those of the St
Paul, Southern Railway, and Louisville
and Nashville companies. The conspicu
ous features of the dealings were Sugar
Refitting (in regard to the dividend on
which, some rather belated misgivings
have arisen), and People's Gas, and small
er declines were noted throughout the in
dttstrial Quarter.
The net declines in the standard rail
way issues in few cases passed out of frac- j
ttoaai limits, but the market, even for j
those stocks, was wholly wanting in ani- j
matton. London was a very moderate in- j
fluence in the local market, although prices
were reported depressed thereby by reason
of the stringency of money. The actual
dealings here for foreign account were,
however, limited to a few thousand shares I
oetd on balance the foreign dealings were
iaoansiderahle. It was a matter of some
comment that in the President's message
to Congress the recent bond call was re
ferred to as being in effect & resumption
of the operations of the Treasury's sink- j
log fond. In that event, it would appear
that there is ample room for further ope
rations of the kind, should they become
expedient.

Near the cloce of the stock market yes
terday there was hairy liquidation oC long
stock by the public, and a switching to
the bear aide. It seems probable that there
"will be a continuance of this movement
tatta morning;. A far as can now be Judg
ed. 00 wry good evidence, the public as
ummI to Jumping at the last moment of
the decline, and will witness an advance
of prices from this time forward. This
raay not begin immediately, but it is
tbevgfat by the best informed people that
the bear attack will not carry prices much
If aaur lower. The present market is a
ball market, and declines of one and two
points to securities that have recently ad
T&oeed Jive and ten points do not make it
anything eteo. The conditions of the
oasmtrr. the conditions of the market are
all bullish. The decision of the Supreme
Oottrt in the "Addyston pipe case" and the
President's message are both extremely
halliah documents viewed from any rea
sonable aad honest position. Prices this
-winter will go very much higher, according
1a the men best fitted to form an opinion.
It Is not Impossible that the little shake
oat of the past two days may give the
leaders of the market the opportunity they
have been seeking to begin the strong up
ward movement.
It is not very difficult to analyze the
market since Sunday. The newspapers on
Sunday were most optimistic in their

financial articles naturally enough. The
good news of the preceding week, and ilie
promises of a bullish President's message
together with the known bullishness of the
financial leaders and the certainty that
these men will advance prices this winter
were sullicient causes for optimism. The
bear leaders, however, took advantage of
the profit taking on Monday morning to
hammer stocks. They helped their selling
by a wholly erroneous statement as to the
meaning of the decision of tbe Supreme
Court in the Addyston pipe case, and by
predictions "from the people who knew"
that the President's message would attack
the trusts viciously. In addition to this
they -were able to maintain call money
rates on Monday as high as 10 per cent.
The actual facts as to the Supremo
Court decision were stated in this column
accurately and fully yesterday. The ordi
nary industrial corporations are not in
jured by it in the least. There is even a
direct statement that such companies must
not be considered to be included within iho
scope of the decision. As to the message a
reading of the document will probab y con
vince anyone of his mistake that sold stock
esterday on hints that it would be a
"bear document." The items of the mes
sage that logically may be considered to
have a bearing on the stock market arc
the urging of a strong "expansion policy."
the recommendation of the single gold
standard, and of currency reform in gen
eral, the strong plea for a subsidy bill, and
the discussion of the "trusts." As to the
first four of these matters, there can 1)3
no question that Mr. McKinley's remarks
are entirely in harmony with the general
sentiments of Wall Street, and in this way
will in time exert a strong bullish effect.
Mr. Mclvinley knows, as nearly everyone
does, the evil results of the reckless form
ing of trusts. He wishes, but not more
than all conservative "Wall Street men do,
to have these evils abolished. Very care
fuHy he draws the distinction, however,
between "what is injurious and what is
useful and necessary in business opera
tions." The logical and sensible way to
read his remarks on trusts, and the way
that they will be read by Wall Street in a
very short time, is that he urges Congress
to pass laws curbing just such concerns as
the Addyston pipe pool, which was detiieJ
against in the Supreme Court yesterday.
The very plain statements of Mr. Hanna
recently on the question of industrial cor
porations in general show as clearly as one
could wish that this Administration har
bors no intention of making a general on
slaught on them.- If this Congress docs as
much as Mr. McKinlcy recommends and
makes possible the destruction of "what is
injurious" in the present situation, there
can be little doubt that the legitimate cor
porations will be benefited by its new
laws. The reason why Federal Steel pre
ferred stock is selling now at SO and the
common stock at 60 when the company is
earning 15 per cent on the entire capitaliza
tion, is to be found not in the Federal Steel
Company, but in the existence of such con
cerns as the Addyston pipe pool.
It is said to be not impossible than an
important advance may occur in the price
of wheat. Yesterday's market showed a
better tone than has prevailed at any time
recently and the prices advanced nearly a
cent a bushel. The foreign news all points
to a heavier demand from Europe and to
much accelerated shipments in conse
quence. It need not be pointed out that a
big movement of wheat in the coming
month would be an excellent bull argument
for the grangers and the railway list in
general.
Pacific Mail was again advanced buoy
antly yesterday morning, very evidently on
a renewed confidence that the subsidy bill
will be taken up and pushed to passage
early in the session. It went to 49 and a
fraction before the end of the first hour
and there were general predictions that a
much greater advance should' be looked
for in the near future. The decline with
the remainder of the market in the after
noon was small and the stock Is one of not
more than two or three that now show a
net gain for the week. The President's
reference to the needed subsidy for the
merchant marine is so direct and forcible
that there can be no question as to the in
tention of the Administration in this re
gard. It is believed that Pacific Mail must
ultimately sell much higher, but it is
known, to be the intention of the impor
tant market people to make the stock a
"football" while the subsidy bill is under
discussion. Conservative brokers advise
caution against buying it at the top of
bulges with small margins.
Other securities that showed strength
yesterday were New York Central, which
made a net gain for the day, closing at
133 3-S: Colorado Fuel and Iron, Metro
politan Traction, Big Four, the coalers,
and Tennessee Coal and Iron. Despite the
declines nearly everywhere, these securi
ties refused to tumble, showing good sup
port at all times. There is a general be
lief that New York Central will be taken
up by its friends with the first return
of better market conditions. The coalers
were supported by Mr. Keene, and it is
said that he intends to advance Reading
first in the near future. The company
will pay a dividend on this stock this win
ter. Much interest is felt in the Immediate
future of the Industrial securities gener
ally, and the Iron and steel stocks in par
ticular. It should be noted that there was
no such break in these latter securities
yesterday as might have been expected
from the malicious exaggerations as to the
meaning of the Supreme Court decision
and the President's allusions to the trusts.
The Steel and Wiro and Federal Steel
common stocks have declined three points
each from their best level on this move
ment, and Tennessee Coal and Iron and
Colorado Fuel and Iron went off very lit
tle yesterday. It is quite within the prob
abilities that this final "bear news" re
garding these stocks may bo the signal
for their long-delayed advance to prices
somewhere near in harmony with their
intrinsic values. A quick upward move
ment would dislodge an enormous short
interest in some of these securities.
The annual meeting of the Baltimore and
Ohio has been postponed for two weeks.
It is supposed that this action was taken
out of courtesy to the new stockholders
in the company and also to prevent general
knowledge of the scope of the new hold
ings too soon.
Sugar was particularly week nearly all
day. The attack on the stock
was a bear raid entirely. It was
helped along by the usual story that the
dividends on the common stock are to be
reduced, or even passed. No foundation
for the rumor could be discovered, and as
usual It Is not credited by well-Informed
people. Another matter of a very different
nature was learned regarding the business
of the Sugar Trust yesterday. The conce. n
Is Increasing its exports of sugar enor
mously. Tho earnings of the Metropolitan Trac
tion Company coutinue excellent, as has
been stated heretofore in this column. The
increase in October heretofore mentioned
is being commented on by directors and
stockholders as entirely satisfactory.
There is talk of a "melon" for Great
Northern stockholders, in tho shape ot
"rights" equal to an extra 5 par cent divi
dend. The sroe earnings of the Southern Rail
way for the fourth week of November in
creased $76,57S. The Increase for tho month
was $271,653, and for the first five months
of the flecal year $1,397,837. The gross earn
intj6 of the Missouri Pacific for the week
increased $77,000, and for the month In
creased $220,000. LouIaviHe ami Nashville
made a gain in gross earnings for the week
of $141,346, and for the month of $347,221.
Leather common stock was buoyant yes
terday, and the "insiders" were said to be
buying it lor "another turn." The public Is
not disposed to help them, however.

CHICAGO, Dec. 5. Wheat developed
considerable strength today. The factors
were light, primary receipts 1,000,000 less
for the first two days of the week, and
3,000,000 bushels less than last year, the
Ohio State crop report showing a condi
tion of SO, against 100 last year, and firmer
Liverpool cables. Clearances were liberal,
C00.000 bushels. The San Francisco mar
ket was up a cent on improved export de
mand. The light primary movement would
suggest that our visible has reached its
decreasing period, and this, in conjunction
with decreasing stocks in Europe and
afloat, shows that improvement in the ex
port demand Is not unlikely. Today's
business, however, was small.
Corn advanced l-2c today and held It.
There was influential buying by local pro
fessionals. Coarse grains felt in a meas
ure the wheat strength. The advance was
largely a sentimental one. The shipping
demand was not Improved, bids were gen
erally out of line. The contract stock,
1,020,000 bushels, showed a decrease for
the week of 38,000 bushels.
Oats moved up l-4c because it seemed to
be the fashion for the grains to make smo
rally. The shipping situation was similar
to that In corn, the bids were out of line,
except on old through billing on rates con
siderably under the present nominal tarilf.
The export demand is Hat.
Lighter hog receipts than expected and
sympathetic influence of the grain mar
kets gave provisions a sharp advance, the
market closing firm at the improvement.
There was an active trade with a good
Investment demand, a prominent local ope
rator leading the buying. Packers sold
moderately and there was free realizing
by outside longs. The cash demand was
moderate.

CHICAGO, Dec. 5. Liverpool closed
3-S higher; London held gtlffer; Paris
wheat 5c up, flour 20c up; Antwerp un
changed. Kansas State report makes yield
43.600,000 bushels, against Government re
port of about se.000,000. Ohio Stats report
makes the condition 60; says Hessian fly
has played havoc with growing wheat.
Many fields have been utterly ruined and
Dlant has not suffered more in years from
the fly than it has this autumn. It is in
very poor condition to meet winter weath
er. Reports from other winter wheat
States are very nearly of the same tenor,
but it will be a long time before the ex
tent of the damage can be fully ascertain
ed. Primary receipts, G67.000; shipments,
977.000. The receipts show a marked dimi
nution in comparison with last year. The
eight principal points show a total of
111,000,000, against 147,000,000 bushels In
1SD8. Total stock here, 20.55G.000, Includ
ing 11,848,000 contract in public houses.
Clearances, C4G.00O bushels. Better ex
port demand Is reported on tho Pacific
Coast. Minneapolis estimates stocks in
country elevators 15,000,000 bushels. A
large decrease is looked for in the uext
visible statement.
A much better tone has prevailed today
and there was good buying by commission
houses. The foreign and statistical news
was all of a bullish character, and exert
ed a great deal of influence in changing
sentiment. There has been a fair sized
rally from tho extreme low prices last
week and many would not be surprised to
see higher values tomorrow, on which It
might bo well to accept profits. It may take
some time before a good bull market can
be established.
Corn Contract stocks here, 1,620,000
bushels. Ohio report estimates the crop
in that State at 10G,000,000 bushels, as
against tho Government estimate of 13,
000,000 bushels. Kansas State report makes
the yield 225,000,000 bushels, against Gov
ernment estimate of 2G5,000,000. The mar
ket has been qulto strong and there was
the best kind of buying. Sentiment is
rather bullish.
Provisions Shipments of lard, 3,330,000
pounds; meat, 3,400,000 pounds. Receipts
of hogs at six points, 5D.OO0, against 101,
000 last year. Liverpool bacon and hams
unchanged. Lard 3-S higher. The market
