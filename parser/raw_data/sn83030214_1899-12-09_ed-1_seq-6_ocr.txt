must mend it. You know ihat It is no Constitu?

This I*, a somewhat crude expression of a
partial view, but It Is not without moral force,
A tendency to recognl/.o the Inconvenient posl
lion in which the Federal Government may be
placed by the limitation <?f Ita powera is clearly
tra??-?i la ?is habitual rcadineea to make pecu?

advisability of bestowing upon It such S measure

THE -CALLED OFFS."
The more the Mazet Committee ?xplalns Its
sudden running away from the reception of
further testimony the moro ridiculous does It
become. It goei far to justifying the con?
tempt which the Tammany men all along
expressed f,,r its Impartiality and good
faith. It puts them nt ? decided advantage,
for whatever sins were brought lnuno to Tam
many, hypocrisy was n??t among them. Mr.
Croker and his followers at least had the cour?
age to face their accusers. They frankly
avowed that they made poliiio? ami business
go hand In hand, and they did not, like Mr.
Mazet und his nasodstes maha i pretence ??f
high moral principles merely to prove at a crisis
that they were shamming virtue. They li-ft
bueaUIng to Mr. Platt and his agent.-.
We notice that one of the latest excuses Is
that the committee was trying to discipline Mr.
Moss and teach him his place. Mr. Fallows, for
Instance, is quoted as saying: "I'm not going
"to be rim by the paid usslstant of the Mazet
"Committee now or at any oilier time." Mr. Fal?
lows ought to turn ba.k bia memory s few
months to the beginning of the work of that
"paiii insistant." He may recall thai when the
committee first carne to New-York it was partic?
ularly anxious to make people believe that it
meant to do thorough, Impartial work and could
not be "called off.'1 Mr. Moss was a good deal
more than Its "paid assistant" Just then. The
committee gave Its pledge to an Incredulous
world that Mr. Moss was to be absolutely ?u
hampered, and Mr. Moss, with the aequlo??:ene?
of his employers, announced that he became
counsel to the committee only on the promise
that be should have full freedom to probe wher
ever and as deeply as be wished. Words ?ould
not have gone further to assure the public that
it could trust the comuiitlee because It was
simply the legal Instrument to enable Mr. Moss
to use all his experience as a non-partisan re?
former for the exposure of wickedness who?!?
over found. If Mr. Moss was then the imie
creature of the organization majority In the
committee that fact wai- carefully concealer].
But Suppose Mr. Moss was a creature to he
disciplined? What wa? tho serious crime which
s?? ahocked the commltteemen thal they went
and hld iheir faces? Merely that he wanted to
lock Into telephone, East Hiver Bridge ami
Queens County matter?, and suggested that Sen?
ator Platt's testimony was needed? What an
Interesting confession: What is it that the
commlttoomon know or suspect about thOSC
subjects that they consider them too sacred to
lay bands upon? Strange, Indeed, that they
should run away ami chide Mr. Moss for his
Impudence In mentioning them! The moro they
flounder with their contradi, tory stories about
ihe "adjournment the mon? clearijr everybody
sees that the real reason was to block Investi?
gation along the line.; that Mr. Moss had In?
dicated ho would follow. Mr. Mazet seems to
realize this, for ho says he has decided to stop
talking, aud that "people ran think what they
want to." Thla kind permission has heen some
what anticipated. People thought what they
wanted to before election, and failed to semi
Mr Mazet back to the Assembly because they
thought he was not honestly Impartial In his
InVestlgStlon. but, while making pr?tent?* of re
formlng sesl, was really keeping in concealment
arandale whieh Mr. Moss wanted t<? probe, for
fear some barm would be dom? t?? Benator Platt.
Perhaps Mr. Mazet has concluded that || tli?
verdict of history, ami is prepared to nccept it
with resignation. But we had not supposed tha*
ali of his fellow Republicana on the committee
were ready to exhibit themselves as ruuavv.tys
from truth, and bsve Croker/s Question, "Why
don't you call Platt'.'' ?vor dsug?ng derisively
after them.
EENTVCEY DRAGON'S TESTS
The story of the lyn? hing of a murderer at
Maysville. Ky., on Wednesdsy li'*?' '?vas horrible.
Hut it was not the worst thal Itate oould afford.
There has come since a still more ?shocking bil
of news--worse In Its algulucancs ami Its m?n
ace. It comes lu the letter of a leading lawyer
and citizen of Maysville to the Governor of the
State, and Is to this effect that while the paople
Of Maysville are as good as those of any other
community In the State, and while they nre
ShochSd at th?' f-'iewsonie horrors of the lym-h
I lug, "they will not take kindly to any attempt to
1 'hold the parties to the transaction to snj re
' sponslblllty therefor." That, we submit, Is the
most appalllug Indictment of the pi op]?- of Mays
ville and? by implication, of the whole State nf
| Kentucky thSt COUld well be BWdS
For what Is its gosport 1 That th.- paopli
countenance crime of the most hhleous nature
snd resent any otTurt te suppress or punish It or
to vindicate the law More than that. The
people will not permit any Interference with th?*
training of their children In waya of aavage
cruelty and canniballstl?- lust of blood. That,
and nothing loss, Is the plain nn-nnlng of this
lawyer's ?le.laratlon. Nut?? the facts: Here
wns a man who bn?l committed ? murder noth?
ing moro, nothing lesa n?- waa In the hands of
the offloer? of the law. There was no shadow of
doubt thal he WOUld promptly be put to death by j
duo procesi of law The next relative of his ,
victim solemnly promised t?> attempt no rio-j
len.?-, but to let Hie law take Ita course. Then
be deliberately broke that premiss nnd ergaa?
toed ami led a mob to ?l.-fv and break the law.
The criminal was not morell pul to death by the
mob That was n,,t whal the limb WUUtod. It
Wanted torture. It wanted to gloat {"r hours
over the agonlea of a fellow mau. It wanted to
listen to his shrieks of palo. t?> wat? h his w rilli ?
Inga, to dabble lingera in ins blood, to imell the
? d?.r of les burning flesh. And it did nil that.
No1 only non ?lid so, but women. to?>, and little
children six yeera old. J.nile boys and glrll
?arer*1 led by their parenta to nratcb a sij-ht ns
revolting as any f>ast ,.f cannibals or torture by
Apaches, nnd ?ver.- made t?. participate In the
awful work, ami received fragmenta of the lort?
iiitii body ne playthings aud It i*?1 pashen, mere
li nothing In Poa*? "Hook ?>f Martyrs" nor In
the blatory ?u* Indian maasacree, nor yet in the
most grewsome Imagining? <?f writer? ??f morbid
to lion, more Irredeemably abominable, And we
nr?- told by an Indisputable authority whose pre
poasesaiona are all in their favor thal the people
of Maysville will mu brook any attempt to .;ill
the doora of thes.? horrors to scconnt.
It that be Hue, and If It be litio that Hie people
of Maysville are lu this matter a? good as those
of nnj ether community in the state, then in
?leed Is the soil of Kentucky BOWS with dragon's
teeth. If Hie boys ami giris of to ?lay aro to be
trained up to th?- perpetration <>f nameless cruel*
ties upon their fellow- and inducted into Hie
commission of tortor?? for torture's sake they
i may as well al once tak? CallgUls ami Nero for

THE soi TB AFRICA \ CAMPAIGN.
The campaign In South Africa is again becom
Ing active. 1 usput. hex Indicate that heavy light?
ing has been returned at the Modder uiver. By
this time a great battle may hnve been fought,
with r.-snits of prime importance. Thora is
a? Hvity, also, at Ladysmith and along the
. ?range Uiver lo what eft"? t does BO* yet ap?
pear. Still, the campaign lias dragged far more
slowly than was anticipated by sanguine lint?
ons. There is no more talk of British troopa
eating their Christmas dinner lu Pretoria. It la I
now doubtful If that meal la tasted by ihem on j
Boor soil The preeent prospect Is that until '
some time after Christinas they will be kept '
busy at the task of clearing British soil of Boor
Invaders ami of relieving besieged British gurri

ii will take some time io drive them back. In ''
Capo Colony thev have rea? lied and annexed
Dordrecht. That place is fifty mun s,,,,.), ???
the Ora nue Uiver. It will lake some tim?- to I
drive them back so far, especially ?luce the
1 Mitch residents of that region are aiding ami
joining the invaders in lafgs numbers. Over a*
iii?- Modder Uiver the dashing ailvance of Lord
Methuen caine to a dead halt a week and more
ago, w?? were ioi?i, with Kimberley still twenty
milos away. If his ndvaUCS has now boen re?
new ?-?I. even if Kimberley has been or is soon to
be relieved, still Mafeking Is far beyond. And
beyond all these it ?s ?i urary march to cither j
Pretoria ?>r Bloomfonteln.
.lust why the British advance was halted, or
apparently halted, ?l<>?'s not appear. The British
censorship can be most otu. lent when it trie?, in i
the absence of any definite Information ag lo
Oeneral Boiler's plans it may be reasonably as
sinned, first, that he realizes that time Is on h's
side and against the Boors, and, second, that it I?
desirable to mak?? his advance stmultaneously all
along the line. The Boers have a poor commis
sarlat, their discipline Is not coh??sive and their
supplies of ammunition ure nor Inezbaoetlble
and not to be replenished. Delay, therefore,
will mean some disintegration of the Boor army
and a less?nlng of Its effectiveness. "We all re?
member well how. In our own Civil War, the
Southern Stafeg suffered much because of their
lack <?f manufactures and their COUOequent Ina
billty to supply iheir ??wn needs A? for the
second point, it seems equally obvious. Had
Lord Methuen hurried righi oil to Kimberley -
supposing him able io ?lo so he would have re
HOV?HI that pine??. But he would also have
driven the big Boor army lhere away and sent It
scurrying across country to reinforce the Boers
at Dordrecht or around Ladyumfth. So If -i<!
vanee were? made at any one point beyond all
others It would mean a concentration of the
Boors at another point, (ieneral Buller's game
probably Is therefore to koop the Boers at all
Ihree oble? points engatrcd. to advance upoD
them as equally as poonthie at ali points, nnd
Huis t.? deprive the Boors of the advantage
wblcb iheir superior mobility is supposed to
give them
In the menu time It is gratifying to observe
two things. One li thai stories or Inhuman prac?
tices ?m either sid.- are found t.? be mistaken.
The Boers IN tot. w* confidently believe, muk
Lng ?i practice of tiring on hospitals or ambii
lancee or of using tings of truce for purposes of
deceit, nor aro th?- British resorting to anything
contrary to ti** a?'<?-pte?i roles of rlvtlinod wnr*
fare. Bo far sa n*sr ran be humane, this is n
humane war. The other point Is that the DOT
rors ??f a negro nprinlng era tims far everted,
ami danger of them aeema now- t?? be remote.
Had SUCb nn uprising occurred this war would
have become ?me of the most ?In-adful in all his
lory. Happily the warlike Basutos have been
restrained by the British, ami ?he Keilira ??f ths
Boer Slates bave Hhewlne been kept w?-ll lu

foundl] thankful If there must be war It Is
well thal It should be confined within the nar

WBEEB THE "TRI srs" STAND.
The decision of Ihe Supreme ?'.?mt in the Ad

beering upon the legal status of the many In

claim whati'Vt-r to i"' au sctual consolidation of

operation? Illegal, cannot be disputed even by
tho?e who have regarded that set us a mistake,
' But the decision places lu ?'lear light Hie fact
that It was not the mere form ??f organization
that made th?- combination Illegal, but th?- effort
t?? exercise the powers of a monopoly in con*
' trolling pri?'?-* ami reetrlctlng latentste traine.
At euee the question arises. 11,(\\ many of the

Since IH? ??ne ran know while many coweVUS
are managed erith secrecy as they have been,
every ahareholder in them has tn lake sol
merely the ususi snd measurable risk of a
manufacturing business on a great scale, but
some dcgr?-e of risk that the whole organization
may prove t.? lu? unlawful In its conduct and
purpose, and It? stocks may therefore prove
nearly or ?pille worthless. With greater pub
Holly than mo?! of Ihe companies have permit

HAM EACH RED EXHORTS.
The strong satisfaction in different branch?e
of trade with the exports In <?,-t??tx?r can hardly
be nndersl.i by m >st persons without further
Informad,,n. A long statement recently tole
graphed from Washington to Various Journals
-howell the exports of leading -lasses for ten
months ending with October thla year ami last,
which evidently missed entirely the point that
gives most satisfaction to thS expert's In differ
??nt branches of trade. When the year began
contracts for ?'sport were being made at prices
about as l,?w as those of last year, and these
contracta st suck prices caused a largo part of
the exports lu the ten months compiled with
lest year Y.-t such returns cast no light on the
all Important question whether Hie expansion
of manufacture,! exports has been Stopped by
the advance In j,rices or Is likely t.> stop.
Owing to the early SOOtTSCtS St low prices great
Improvement In ton months might have ap?
peared, in spit?? ??f material decresss In the latt r
mouths, after prices bad risen. But the "ill
.-lal record clears away occasion for apprehen?
sion.
After deducting the value of the great staples
from the domestic exports In October, the ro
malnder for the minor exports, mainly manu?
factured, Is larger lu value than In any previous
month excepting August and March. This
value. 1481578,606, was exceeded only ?$2<K?,<HJO
in Mnr.li. and not $4<M>.00.? In August, but the
amount includes some products not manufact?
ured. The official classification,Which includes re?
flned petroleum, adds on that account $1,S00,(XK)
to the value of manufactured exports In October
compared with last March, but In th?? loading
mannfacltired products the extraordinary March
exports were only .*.n..2(H>,t)?H) larger than those
of October, and in August the difference WSS
trilling. In all other months th?? exports of
manufactured products erera smaller than in
October, so that it cannot bo claimed that is
yet the rise In prices of munufnetured products
hore has reduced exports to other countries.
'Ihe following figures, from the official dassl
Beetloo for different months, exclude Important
products of mines and forests which are lu
