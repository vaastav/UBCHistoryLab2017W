FIFTEEN CENTS A WEEK
Extensive Program of Reconstruction Leg
islation Is Outlined in President Wilson's
Message Sent to Congress Today Says
Little in Regard to the Treaty Situation
"Democratization of Industry" Is Best
Solution for Nation-Wide Unrest.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. (By United Press.) President
Wilson today sent to congress a message urging an extensive
program of reconstruction legislation.
His communication was devoted entirely to the great domes
tic problems confronting the nation.
Though the President several times referred to the peace
treaty and League of Nations, he didn't discuss the treaty sit
uation. He'll do so in a later message, according to reliable
information. He will also deal later with the railroad question.
Much of his message was devoted to the discussion of the
labor problem.
"To solve it," the President said, "congress must now help
in the task of finding a method that will bring about the gen
uine democratization of industry."
He recommended the establishment of a national budget
system, simplification of income excess profit taxes, legislation
to secure employment and land for service men, laws to en
courage an increased crop production, protection of America's
1 new chemical dyestuff industry, federal aid in building good
roars, development of forest resources, enactment by Attorney
General Palmer's department of legislation dealing with reds,
legislatio nto reduce the cost of living, extension of the Lever
act, laws to bring about the democratization of industry, in
cluding the participation of workers in decisions affecting their
welfare, establishment of principles regarding labor laid down
in the League of Nations.
"No better means of bringing about the democratization of
industry can be found," the President declared, "than by ap
plying in legislation the principles set up in the labor section
of the League of Nations covenant. To go back to the old
standards of labor and wages is impossible," he said.
"Age-long antagonism between capital and labor must be
ended," he declared, "before real world stability can be accom
plished." The President is against anti-strike legislation. "The right
of individuals to strike is inviolate," he declared, "and ought
not to be inteferred with by any process of government." But
he added that the government has a right to protect the people
against the challenging aggression of any single class.
Blame for the unrest in this country was placed partly upon
the senate for its failure to ratify the peace treaty.
The" President suggested the establishment 'of a tribunal be
fore which disputes between labor and capital can be taken
for settlement. The President made an urgent plqa for legis
lation to encourage increased production. "Help make rural
life more attractive, and food production will be stimulated,"
he argued.
President Selects Joshua William
Alexander, of Missouri, to Fill Office
of Secretary Redfield, Resigned
WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. (By United Press.) Joshua Wil
liam Alexander, congressman from Missouri, has been selected
by President Wilson as Secretary of Commerce, succeeding Sec
retary Redfield, resigned, it was announced today.
His nomination will be forwarded to the senate tomorrow.

Another Arrested

and it is announced that direct evi
dence, in many cases has been ob
tained. Activities of the officers is
said to have been directly due to a
series of robberies committed upon
goods in transit during the past three
years, it is announced.
Evangelist Watts
Delivers Stirring
Lecture Last Night
"All the world .will soon be a mass
of ruins. The great buildings now
standing in our cities are doomed to
be cast into a heap, and those people
who turn their backs on God will be
destroyed with them," declared Evan
gelist Watts in a stirring lecture at
the Liberty Theatre last night on the
"Milennium."
He based his remarks on Revela
tion 20:1 9, and said that the Milen
nium was a period of 1,000 years,
bounded by two resurrections, the one
at the beginning being the resurrec
tion of the righteous, and the one at
the end, the resurrection of the wick
ed. He declared that the doctrine
of a second chance of salvation was
without foundation in the Bible.
"When Christ was on earth," said
the evangelist, "he declared that 'as
it was in the days of Noah, so shall it
be in the davs of the Son of man.'
Luke 1 7 :2G. How was it in the days
of Noah? In Genesis, the sixth chap
ter, we are told, 'that the wickedness
I of man was great upon the earth, for
the earth was filled with violence.'
How can any one take the position
that there is to be a thousand years
of peace' before Christ comes? The
Bible doctrine of the Milennium is
that this period begins at the second
coming of Christ, when the wicked
are destroyed and the righteous dead
are resurrected.
"The Apostle Paul, in 1 Thess.
4:16-18 says that 'the Lord is com
ing to gather the righteous together,
both the dead and the living.' and in
Revelation 20:fi, this class is called
blessed and holy, and shall reign with
Christ a thousand years.' Paring
this period the earth will be desolate
las foretold by Jeremiah in the 4th
chapter 23 to 27 verses. At the close
of the thousand years, the righteous
will return to this earth, when the
holy city comes down from God o'.it
of heaven. The wicked dead will be
raised; Satan will be loosed, these un
numbered hordes will surround the
city in an attempt to capture it, and
this will be the last meeting of Adam's
race. Then ye shall see Abraham,
Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of
God. and ye yourselves thrust out.
That is the time that every knee shall
bow before the Lord. Men and wo
men of Greeneville will be in the
throng, either with Christ in the city
or with the Devil on the outside."
The evangelist announced his sub
ject for tonight as "Christ's Great
Prophecy of His Second Coming."

Angeles' Son
to Wage War on
Carranza
NEW YORK, Dec. 2. Alberto An
geles, twenty-wo-ye.ar-old son of
Gen. Filipe, Angeles, the Mexican rev
olutionist who was executed 'by the
Carranza regime, hopes " to move a
share in the movement for the over
throw of Cnrranza and the establish
ment of a democracy that will re
spect its international obligations and
its own constitution.
He said that the family finances
were now precarious, but he would
take up his task. His mother, who is
seriously ill, has not yet been told of
her husband's death. Young Angeles
works as a shipping clerk in an ex
port house, and his sister is studying
stenography.
"My father's death will crystallize
the cause for which he fought," he
said. "If I am in such a position that
I need not worry over the support of
my mother, I will enter the fight for
the establishment of a democracy in
Mexico that will respect its interna
tional obligations and its own con
stitution. "We Mexicans do not want Ameri
can intervention," he continued. "We
will fight our own differences. We
arc a sovereign people end wish to be
regarded as such. All political dif
ferences in Mexico will vanish if in
tervention ir. attempted. The Mexi
can people, no matter how much they
may differ among themselves, will
fight to the last against any foreign
powers, no matter how sincere its mo
tives may be."
