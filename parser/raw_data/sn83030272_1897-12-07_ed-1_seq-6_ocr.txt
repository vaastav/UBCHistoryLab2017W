I tS? the expenses of the Goi-ernment," green-
rSp' backs ones redeemed in gold shall not be

$ tary Gage, with whom tho President con
by. curs In the recommendation that the na
il f tlonal bank circulation be extended by al
) lowing the banks to Issue notes up to the
fj V full value of the bonds deposited at Wash
j j lnj-ton ; by reducing the tax on their clrcu.
; r latlon; and by reducing to $23,000 the
t g) ! minimum of the capital required by law
r w for the establishment of a national bank.
)i But the President adds at the same time
E tao recommcna'in t-'at be national
fpS' bank circulation shall be restricted by
ImMfl i shout one-third by confining It to denoml
K nations of 10 and upward, that Is to say,
$K by cutting out the 75,000,000 or there
Kf t 1 shouts of national bank fires, and also that
WM the national banks shall be required to re
if Kfe. deem their notes In gold.
iv Beassertion of the traditional American
HM& ' policy respecting Cuba; namely, that the
I,? , United States will permit no disturbance
'4' i ' f-ul,A's connection with Spain, unless In
PW$ b direction either of Independence or of
SKSfc t acirulBltion by us. This Is followed by a
flEf ; recital of the erlls of the present war and
$K by the statement that there Is no desire on
5ft'" tne P1 ' our people to profit by the mls
1 fortunes of Spain. Our offers of friendly
if mediation heve been rejected at Madrid.
I. St The President then proceeds to consider
ffj i-fttl'j" tno several courses which hare been
r Sp auggested as proper for our GoTernment to
T take. He regards the recognition of being
's ffi erency as unwise and Inadmissible. Inter
I f Tentlonongroundsofhumanltylsdtsmlssed
' j for the present aa unfair to the new Sagosta
I ' Government, whose plan of autonomy, so-
' i called, is minutely and not too critically
&,. described by Mr. McKinlet. The other
k - courses possible to our Government, namely,
f gf recognition of Cuban Independence, neutral
f InterventiontocoropelacompromlBe.dIrect
& Intervention In behalf of one party or the
j M4 other, and forcibleannexation to the United
J m States, he mentions but does not discuss
k '& except to say Incidentally that the last
fi plan, annexation, is not to be thought of.
The long and short of Mr. McKinlet's ree-
tl $ i ommendatlons concerning Cuba is that our
at Government should wait a while, to give
the Sagasta Government an opportunity to
$ ik conquer or pacify the island.
& W A to Hawaii, the President expresses a
Km p positive opinion. He believes in annexa-
J& tlon. He declares that every consideration
jk- of dignity and honor requires the ratlflra-
v' tlon of the treat now landing in the Sen-
l ate, leaving to the wisdom of Congress the
f j problems of asaimllat ion.
; S If It Is true, as is now reported, that the
i i Japanese Governmrnt has neither with-
I m drawn nor modified Its original protest
fr against our annexation of Hawaii, the part
3f- of President McKinlet's message which
a ar refers to Japan's attitude was prematurely
J $M conceived.

' lH The Holiday Trade.
i After the McKlnley tariff became law
, iff there was. a loud outcry against it all over
(' j the Union on the alleged ground that It
!! 1 had lncreas,1 ffieiously tbecost of alarge
fwM Part of 'l'e rommodities necessarv to the
am "ally life of the people. Undoubtedly this
jfi contributed to the election of Mr. Cleve-
WW t--Nw ' Iht-', with the consequent enact-
; l wnt of the trtarheroua, bungling, and dis.
I hF strous Wilson tariff.
:! m T1,e D'ngley tariff has now been In opera-
tlon for about four months and some of lu
rates are higher than tho.e of the McKinley
tariff; but the complaints which were loud
tin ISiKi are not repeated In IMt", or U
least they are con Gtud to iiewspajHrs whose
opposition to it it. partisan. We question
If the run of reople discover the effects of
the new tariff In the prites of the articles
they purchase, "When there is uy iacreave

In them becauM ot the greKter dattea lm
posed, It attract marked attention la a few
Instances only. The trouble with tho
Dingley tariff, so far aa popular sentiment
Is' concerned. Is that It Is not raising revenue
enough for the expenses of thaGovernment,
not that Its rates are injuriously high for
the consnmer.
This Is the season ot tho holiday trade,
and already It is giving great activity to
I many branches of business and industry. It
Is described by merchants as having begun
earlier than usual this year and to be as
suming proportions which promise to make
Its volume larger than ever before. More
over. In spite of the new tariff, shoppers
are attracted by prices which are small
as compared with those of a few years ago.
Improvements In methods of manufacture
are lessening continually the cost of pro
duction and thus maklngnp for any Increase
In the cost ot the materials entering Into
their manufacture. In order to compete
with domestic production the foreign manu
facturer Is forced to put down his prices
to the lowest possible limit and to reserve
the narrowest margin of profit. Conse
quently, the difference In cost to the Ameri
can purchaser because of the higher tariff
is rarely enough to be especially notice
able, and. being confined to comparatively
few articles, principally consumed by a
small minority of thecommuntty. It does not
appear at all to the great mans of buyers.
It Is true that sugar Is a little dearer, but Its
advance Id price Is too trifling to have any
considerable effect In Increasing a family's
expenses. Other articles of food, flour, for
Instance, have gone up, but without regard
to the tariff.
It Is sufficient to read the holiday adver
tisements in TitE Sun to obtain convincing
evidence of what we have said. They show
that money never went further than it goes
now, and so far as concerns skill and taste
in manufacture it never went so far.
Tho Tall-End Slugwump Papor.
The Boston Herald, which supported the
Hon. Seth Low with really Impressive
ignorance and enthusiasm, continues to
shed the darkness of its misinformation
over the polities of New York. Its view of
the political tnfl lence of the remarkably
unselfish and popular person who was nom
inated for Vice-President by the Republi
can party in 1892 will be treasured by all
students of h union
"The .Vrw Tork 3Yftunhu apptrentlr enlltted for

We can hear the tears drop In the publica
tion office of Mr. WnrrrLAw Beid's paper
when, even In Ignorant kindness, anybody
calls It the leading Republican paper of the
State of New York. In that office the facts
are known. There the pecuniary remorse
of Mr. Wnmuw Beid is set down upon
books which will not lie, thus differing
diametrically from the upstairs shop ot Mr.
Whitelaw Beid.
The newsdealers In this town and
through the State can give a shrewd
guess aa to the present depth of the
pecuniary remorse. Mr. WnrrELAW Bets
kicked at the Republican party In the
last campaign. The Republican readers of
Mr. Retd's paper promptly and effectually
kicked him. They are not taking his pa
per. Nobody Is. Its circulation is princi
pally confined to Its exchange list. The
rents of the toll building in which the
paper Is printed are dumped fnto the deep
deficit which the paper makes, but do not
come near filling It. The pecuniary remorse
of Mr. WmTELAtr Bsu on account of the
refusal of Republicans to have anything to
do with his paper is acute and even awful.
Sadness In the publication office; wri things
in the Tower.
In tbe days of Horace Gbeelbt the
7Vi6un was the leading Republican jour
nal of the United States. In the days of
the man who took It from Horace Ghee
let's dying hand the Tribune has become
the tail-end Mugwump paper of tbe United
States. Its Influence upon the Republican
party of New York at present must be
nearly equal to the influence of a fishworm
upon the precession of the equinoxes.
Weak Arguments for Bank Currency.
In what will fortunately be his last offi
cial report, Mr. James B Eckels, the
Comptroller of the Currency, makes an
elaborate but altogether insufficient argu
ment in favor of retiring the Government
notes, now circulating as currency, and of
substituting for them notes issued by
banks, partly upon security and partly
upon their own assets. Mr. Eckels Is not
famous for his ability as an advocate. A
year ago he presented. In bis annual re
port, a compilation of figures Intended to
prove that the failure to fund in 1879 the
5340,000,000 of old legal tenders Into 4
per cent, bonds had cost the nation a loss
of $340,000,000, but he arrived at his con
clusion by so palpable a misstatement of
facts that only a few ill-informed people
were deceived into accepting It. Without
retracting, qualifying, or withdrawing this
misstatement, he proceeds, this year, to
make, in behalf of the banks, others quite
as wide of the truth.
" It is considered by every great commer
cial Government except the United States,"
says Mr. Eckels, " to be the sole province
of Vie bants to issue the paper which clrcu.
lates as currency." This is so far from the
truth that no bank In London and within
sixty-five miles of London, except the Bank
of England, is allowed to issue circulating
notes, and only ten In Scotland and six in
Ireland. There are a few little banks. In
deed, In England which altogether Issue
about 1,000.000 of notes, but this iBsue is
made under charters more than fifty years
old, and is gradually being absorbed'bv the
Bank of England. In France there Is but
one bank which Issues circulating notes;
in Austria-Hungary but one; in Russia but
one; in Germany but nine eight of them
originally Government institutions and one
actually such and in Italy but six. In all
these countries thtre are numerous other
banks, Incorporated and unincorporated,
but to none of them Is granted the privilege
of Issuing currency. When Mr. Eckels,
therefore, speaks of the banks" generally
as having this privilege In foreign coun
tries, so as to give tbe impression that
there, as in this country, many thousands
of them exercise It, he tells an untruth,
Mr. Eckels goes on to say that " the ex
perience of every Government has been
that Governmental currency Is a source of
weakness and danger," This is another
untruth. Germany baa for years issued
Government currency; so has Austria; and
tbe Bank of England, the Bank of France,
the Bank of Germany, and the Bank of Aus
tria are Government Institutions, controlled
or directed by the Government. Our na
tlonal bank notes are printed by tbe Gov
ernment, secured by Government bonds,
and guaranteed by the Government promise
to redeem them, in case the bonds fall to
sell for enough to do so. The only differ
ence between them and tho Government
notes Is that the banks draw Interest both
on tbe bonds deposited to secure them and
on the loans they make ot them. It Gov
ernment currency Is dangerous, then our
national bank currency Is dangerous, too.
The superior ability of the banks to pro
vide for the payment ot these obligations
Is eulogized by Mr. Eckels In a way that
makes one smile, who remembers how,
four times in twelve years, the banks of this
city and nearly everywhere else In the
Union, have defaulted In the payment of
their obligations to their depositors and
driven them to selling their claims at a
discount In order to get currency with
which to carry on their business. He says
that when the Government needed gold It
was the banks which supplied It, but he
omits to mention that this gold was the
property, not of the banks, but of their
creditors, whom they refused at the same
time to pay even in paper. It would bo a
bad day for the country when It had to trly
upon the banks for gold with which to pay
Its debts abroad. Tho banks hare hereto
fore. In every financial crisis, suspended
payment, and they will always do so.
Mr. Eckels repeats the stale and often
repeated falsehood that "the credit of the
Government has more than once been put In
jeopardy" through Its Issue of demand
notes. In defiance of the fact that for tour
teen years, namely, from 1679 to 1893,
these notes never caused the slightest anx
iety, and that through every financial panic
they hare been hoarded as equal In value
to gold. Only when the Government rev
enues began, as they did in 1693, to fall
short of the Government expenditures, and
tho gold reserve was used to meet the defi
cit, was there any question of the Gov
ernment's ability to redeem the notes, and
there never will be again If tbe notes are
refosued only against re-deposits of gold.
The best and tho most that can be said
on behalf of bank currency and against Gov
ernment currency has probably been said by
Mr. Eckels. How weak and inconclusive
his argument is needs no further demonstration.
A Flrst-Hand View of the Advantages
of Hawaiian Annexation.
An American citizen. Mr. A. C. James,
who latelv visited the Hawaiian Islands,
gives an account of his impressions in the
Xorth American Review. The conclusions
he reached are worth reciting, because he
was convinced against his will, having
been, before his sojourn in Honolulu,
strongly opposed to the annexation ot Ha
waii or of any other country.
What caused Mr. James to come away
an ardent annexationist f Tbe principal
reason adduced by him is the relationship
of the Islands to the protection of our
Pacific coast. In the event of war with
Japan, or with any country possessed of
naval power In the Pacific, Hawaii would
be the key to our Western coast, as truly
as Bermuda would be the key to our East
ern coast in the event of war with Eng
land. If we held Hawaii, which can
be easily fortified, our Western coast
would be safe against attack from any
country, with the exception of Great
Britain. Even in the contingency of war
with her, the advantages derivable by us
from a detached coaling and supply station
are evident. It is acknowledged, even by
the opponents of annexation, that the
United States should and would not allow
a foreign power to obtain possession of the
Hawaiian Islands ; but. If this Is true. It
would be always needful for us to defend
them in case of war, while, without annex
ation, we should not be able to fortify
them, or to reap any of the advantages of
ownership in time of peace.
What are tbe advantages obtainable from
the islands In time of peace t Mr. James
answers this question by reminding us that
the Hawaiian group consists of eight in
habited and a few uninhabited islands,
lying within the tropics, at a distance from
San FrandBco of about 2,000 miles. In tbe
aggregate, their area is nearly equal to that
of Massachusetts. Agriculturally, they
have scarcely, as yet, begun to be developed.
Situated in the most fruitful zone of
the earth and possessed of a climate
almost perfect, they are capable of produc
ing all the sugar and coffee which this
country can consume, to say nothing of rice
and other tropical products. Tbey would,
furthermore, provide us with three excel
lent harbors for commerce and coaling sta
tions, and would control the cable commu
nication of the Western ocean, besides aid
ing our shipping by giving to American
vessels the carrying trade between the isl
ands and the mainland.
Mr. James proceeds to discuss seriatim
the objections which have been made to
annexation, but, as we have previously
dealt with these at length, wo now need
touch on them but briefly. As to the asser
tion that annexation would be a radical
departure from the traditional policy of
the Republic, this is overwhelmingly refut
ed by the facts. We have successively an
nexed the Louisiana Territory, Florida,
Texas, tbe territory ceded by Mexico In
1648, the territory Included in the Gadsden
Purchase, and Alaska.
As for Hawaii's notbeingcontiguous, Cal
ifornia was far from being practically con
tiguous in 1848, and for some twenty years
afterward we could reach It only by the
Panama or Nicaragua routes, or by a still
more circuitous voyage around Cape Horn.
Alaska, of course, Is not only not contigu
ous, but parts of that Territory are more
distant from tbe nearest point of the rest
of our national domain than is Hawaii
from San Francisco.
But, we are told, the natives have not
been consulted. Were the nativta of the
Louisiana Territory consulted when Presi
dent JErnrnsojJ purchased that vast region
from Napoleon I Were the natives of
Florida consulted when we purchased It
from Spain I Were the natives of Califor
nia and New Mexico consulted when we
purchased those regions from Mexico!
Were the natives of Alaska consult
ed when we bought It from Russia!
To what extent have the American
Indians been genuinely consult d dur
ing our march across the Continent
from the Atlantic to tbe Pacific! Mr.
James directs attention to tbe fact that tbe
natives of Hawaii have proved themselves
to be Incapable of governing, and physically
unfitted for the conditions of civilization.
Numbering 600,000 In tbe time of Capt.
Cook, about a century and a quarter ago,
they are now reduced to some 30,000, and
occupy much tbe same relation to tbe white
population as do our Indians here. Tbe
importance of their supposed opinions con
cerning annexation has been greatly ex
aggerated, as was proved by the fall.
ure to organize a mass meeting in Hono
lulu for the purpose of proving that the na
tive Hawallans ore actively opposed to an
nexation. The native Hawallans, like tho
whits Inhabitant ot the IslaaA, are welt
aware that annexation It ot the vital
question, for annexation by some power Is
Inevitable. The paramount question Is, To
which country shall Hawaii be annexed!
Shall It be Japan or England, or shall It
bethe United States!
Mr. James, of course, does not deny that
the mixed character of the population, In
eluding, aa It does, large Japanese and
Chinese elements, constitutes an objection
to the admission of Hawaii to Statehood.
But the question of Statehood has not been
raised, and Is no more Imminent than Is the
Statehood of Alaska. Hawaii, when an
nexed.can be governed either as aTerrltory
or under tbe regime now applied success
fully to the District ot Columbia.
This question ot the annexation of Ha
waii Is coming np Immediately. If there
Is any doubt about the confirmation of the
treaty by the Senate, the precedent fur
nlshed by Texas should be followed, and
the Islands should be annexed by a joint
resolution of Congress.
Tho Heroes of tho Day.
The public celebration of the consolida
tion of the Greater New York, which Is
recommended by Mayor Siltoso, Is un
questionably due to the great importance of
the event. The suggestion ot it came from
a correspondent of The Suit.
The first of January next will mark the
beginning of a new era In the history of
New York, and the Initiation of an experi
ment In municipal government which Is
sure to hare a profound Influence upon all
American cities. New York will then step
up to the second place In magnitude among
the great capitals of the world.
It would seem to bo destrahle that If the
celebration U to occur it should take place
under the direction of men who were favor
able to the consolidation and are now satis
fied with It as an achievement, and not of
the pessimistic philosophers who are going
about moaning over It as a fruit of Intoler
able legislative despotism, though actu
ally it was demanded by the popular vote
of the communities concerned. Mayor
Stbong'b selection of a committee of citi
zens to advise with him as to tbe manner
and details of the celebration suggests,
however, that In his view opposition to
tbe consolidation, past and present, does
not constitute any disqualification for such
service.
Whatever else Is done to make the event
memorable, the chief feature of the cele
bration must be the distinction given to
tbe Hon. Andrew H. Green and tbe Hon.
J. S. T. Stranaoan. They are the heroes
for that occasion. Without Mr. Green's
long and enthusiastic labors, so heartily
seconded by Mr. Stbanaiias, there would
have been no Greater New York to cele
brate on Jan. 1, 1898.
The Defences of the Delaware.
The detail of a body of artillerymen for
the new battery at Finn's Point, which has
three 10-inch high-power guns, mounted on
disappearing carriages, is a reminder that
the coast defences, so long delayed, ore now
gradually coming forward to completion.
The barracks are ready for the men, and
this portion of the protection of the Dela
ware can be relied upon at once.
At Fort Delaware, too, in spite of the
labor required tor getting foundations in
the spongy soil, the work Is far advanced,
and before long three 12-Inch and three-10-lneh
guns will be mounted there, while
on the Delaware shore a mortar battery is
going up. Besides this modern ordnance
there are mora than a dozen 8-lnch con
verted rifles in tbe lower casemates of Fort
Delaware, while parked near by are about a
score of smooth-bored, which are perhaps no
longer likely to be put even to auxiliary
uses there.
With the guns already mounted and in
near prospect of readiness, and with tbe
torpedo defences so peculiarly suited to
that region, the Delaware may already be
considered as virtually secure, and this
means safety not only for Philadelphia, but
for the great network of manufacturing
industries around it.

To ttie EDrron or Tng Sun Sir: There It no
uncertain ring In the words of Dr. Whitman at
the banquet of tbe Baptist Brethren in New York
on Thursday night. ,
Dr. Whitman Is Mire. He Is a keen and
vigilant observer. Hettandtata sentinel upon
such dlzrjr heights that there ia fear of his
getting In the clouds, and ha surely will If he
does not use some ballast.
Wonderful man thatl At a Christian he be
lieves in freedom of worship, but as a patriot,
and here It tbe rub, he hat hit eagle eye riveted
upon those red hatted, red-headed, danger-signal
Cardinals. More power to Dr. Whitman I Heit
astute. He scents the dasger from afar. I tell
you plainly that we need more men and uni
versity Presidents like Dr. Whitman.
" Hands off the public schools!" shouted this
patriotic President, and he was greeted with ap
pl ause. Wbat It Rome at now I What specially
ingenloutand hair-raiting schemeare those Car
dinals con"octlng I It Is well to watch them.
Dr. Whitman should be appointed the Grand
Patriotic Watchman. He can see what others
cannot. He knows that Washington It the
capital, not Rome. That Is very commendable
In a university President. Up to this the Catho
lics have believed that Rome was our national
capital. So, at least, mart the doctor.
I write to And out wbat is up now. What Is

Dr. Whitman sajs it our " law-making power r'
Of wbat it It composed t Who are they, any
way I Dr. Whitman mutt know that a Presi

nonsensical rot.
I am living out in the country, and not having
a special wire to Washington, much lest to
Rome, am accepting the ttatementt of The Scn
as " so." I rieo to ask what did Dr. Whitman
mean in bis remarks ut tbe banquet I

Was tb e callow doctor playing to this or to the
servants t At any rate, be got applause. On
this, Coubtlesj. rests the triumphant peace
which now soothes the doctor, for he did His
very best to make Rome howl.
Will the doctor tell ut wbat Rome hat to do
with our public schools I I can tell the good,
dear doctor that Rome has naught to do with
the public schools up our way. Why. the very
tbouu-ht of It! They will send hundreds of miles

tbe Itoinun Catholic Church. It la a parody ou
our taunted free school education, upon the
much lauded unlrerslty tralnlne. to nave a
man In the position of a university President
utter sucb arntnt nonsense.

A decoratlm painting by Flnln II. Dlatk
field with the subject of " Iron" was placed last
spring In a lunette; 13x20 feet. In the new build
ing of the Bank of Pittsburg at Plttiburc,
pa-, and the companion picture of the same
lire has J' st come out of the Custom House and
Is on exhibition at the Am rlcan Art Galleries,
0 Batt Twenty-third street. It is the work of
the well-known American artist. Francis D.
Millet, and was painted at hit studio in Broad
way, England. The subject It " Tlirnruophorls,"
the ancient festival held by the Athenian
women In honor ot Ceres and the composition
depicts tbe procession pasting through tbe fields
on Its way to the temple. The two lunettes
thus tymbollzo In a general war manufactures
and agriculture, and are appropriate to their
emplacement, tbe bank which draws Its treasure
from the two sources of wealth. The Bank, of
Pittsburg was built by George 11. Post, one of 1
the first of our architects to promote the custom
tn this country of placing mural pictures in
both public and private buildings, and one of
the first alto to secure commissions for such
decoration for American artists. The propriety
ot decorating a bank building has been ques
tioned In some quarters, but the arguments
scnlnst It are not very good. If the de
positor are willing to tee money tpent
on costly marbles and huge sheets of
plate glass, why not on artistic decoration t
It ia appropriate if It is not out of character
with Its surrounding! and the purposes for
which the building It used. Reduced to Its
lowest terms the argument would compel the
use of nothing but plnln wooden counter and
windows glaxed with panes of six by eight. An
argument of more force, for us at least, would
be that It Is to be regretted that the two fine
works are to adorn a bank In Pittsburg and
grow dingy with time and soot. Instead of being
In tome place here. They would do ut honor.
Mr. Millet's composition Includes sixteen fig
ures. At tbe left at the head of the procession
are three children carrying symbols of Bacchus.
Then cume three maidens forming a group Jutt
before the central figure, who walks alone and
bear a torch. This figure it a portrait, docc
ratirely treated, of Mrs. De Navarro (Mist ary
Anderson). Next In line are five maidens In
two groups, while another figure out of the line
stooping to tie her sandal, two men, of whom
one blow t on pipes and tbe other carries a sheaf
of wheal, and a splendid white bull, whose
horns and neck are wreathed with
rosea, led by a graceful woman walk
ing at hit side, bring up the rear. Tbe
march of the figures Is slow, so that while mo
tion It tuggettod. there it a sufficient sense of
repose to keep the figures In place, not suggest'
lng the thought that tbey will walk out of the
canvas. The women and children are all clad In
white, and tbe clastic draperies so well under
stood by tbe artist, at well as Boldlnl under
stands cnijTotu of tbe present day, are rendered
with scholarly exactness and simple artistic
effect. Tbe heads of the maident are crowned
with garlandt of flowers, and In their hands
they carry palm and laurel branches,
sheaves of wheat, and baskets ot flowers.
The white draperies are suave and t ender In
color, and a charming note It Introduced in the
composition by a pale yellow veil worn by the
centra figure. The white masses form the
chief elemtnt in tbe color scheme, which in
cludes tawny yellow in a broad band of ripe
wheat stretching from one end to the other of
the picture, and olive and subdued lilac tinu In
the landscape background. Beyond the field of
grain there are fir and cypress trees with their
graceful fonnt In silhouette against hills which
rise to the horizon, A temple crowns one of the
heights, and a quiet sky fills the top of the arch
of tbe picture.
The heads of the women are excellent in
type, the croups are cleverly arranged, and tbe
effect of the work at a whole Is unified and
simple. Betides the artistic merits of the
picture, spectators will find interest In the tact
that, with the exception of the two male figures
(br which models were used, the beads are ail
portraits. The children are two little sons of
the artist, and Miss Brewtsalh The three
women In the first group are Mrs. Phil May
(wife ot the artist on Punch). Miss Fairfax.
and Mist Dixon. Tbe five to the right of the
central figure are Mist Polly and Miss Dorothy
Barnard, who, as children, were painted in Sar
gent's celebrated picture, "Carnation Lily, Lily
Rote." Mist Maud Caffln, Lady Echo, and Mrs.
Alma-Tadema. Tbe charming stooping figure
la Mrs. Millet, and the last Is Lady Blomfleld.
Alma-Tadema painted the wreath of blue
Cowers on hit wife's beautiful Titian red hair,
and Alfred Parsons paid a similar tribute to the
artist by painting the crown of red popples on
the head of Mrs. Millet.
The managers of the American Art Galleries,
where the exhibition of Mr. Millet's picture It
held, have ready a number of proofs of the Il
lustrations for the catalogue de luxe of the W.
H. Stewart collection, which Is to be sold by
them at auction In February. Tbey are photo
gravures made after the most approved modern
metbodt by Elton & Co. or Boston. Tbey are
excellent la color, not actual tints, of
course, but In rendering of color sentiment,
and very good In values. There will be
129 Illustrations In the catalogue, at every
picture lu the collection Is to be reproduced,
and each will occupy a full page. The mounts,
llxlttg Inches, are of India paper, the plates
themselves, about 6x10 Inches, varying In one
dimension with tbe thanes of the canvases.
The text, made up of descriptions of the pic
tures, biographical notes of the artist, an
article on Fortuny, and other matter, will be
printed on band-made paper specially manufac
tured for the purpose by an American firm.
