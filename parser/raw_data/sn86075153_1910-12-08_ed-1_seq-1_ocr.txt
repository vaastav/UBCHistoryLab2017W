Washington, Dec. 8.--President
Taft's annual message to congress
contained 4 0000 words, and is said to
be the longest document of its kind
ever wrtitten. In it he reviews the
work of each of the administrative
departmoets beginning with the state
department. He devotes considerable
space to the satisfactory settlement
of the flsheries dispute with England
through the medium of the Hague
Tribunal, and recounts both the his
tory of the fisheries dispute and the
stablishment of the tribunal.
In connection with the state depart
ment he tells of the important poli
tical happenings of the past twelve
Muonths throughout the entire world,
and the action of this country in con
ection with them.
Tariff Negotiations.
Referring to the negotiation of new
tariff agreements President Taft
saya:
"The new tariff law, in Section 2,
respecting the maximum and mini
mum tariffs of the United States,
hich provisions came into effect on
April 1, 1910, imposed upon us re
bplnsliblity of determining prior to
that date whether any undue discrim
ination existed against the United
tates and iets products in any coun
try of the world with which we sus
thined commercial relations.
"In the case of several countries in
ltances of apparent undue discrimina
tion against American commerce were
0ound to exiat. These discriminations
asr removed by negotiation. Prior
to April 1_, 1910, when the maximum
ri Was to come into operation with
t to imortationes from all those

countries in Wfwose favor no proclama
tion applying the minimum tariff
should be issued by the president, one
hundred and thirty-fouir such procla
mations were issued.
"This series of proclamations em
braced the entire commercial world
and heu e the minimum tariff of the
United States has been, given univer
sal application, thus testifying to the
satisfactory character of our trade
relations with foreign countries.
"Marked advantages to the com
merce of the United States were ob
tained through these tarift settle
ments.
"The policy of broader and closer
trade relations with the Dominion of
Canada which was initiated in the ad
justment of the maximum and mini
mum provisions of the tariff act of
August, 1909, has proved mutually
beneflcial. It justifies further efforts
for the readjustment of the commer
olal relations of the two countries so
that their commerce may follow the
channels natural to contiguous coun
tries and be commensurate with the
steady expansion of trade and indus
try on both sides of the boundary
line."
hlip Subsldy.
The president urges such action as
he believes will increase American
trade abroad, and says:
"Another instrumentality indispen
sable to the unhamapered and natural
development of American commerce is
merchant marine. All maritime and
commercial nations recognize the im
portance of this factor. The greatest
.commercial nations, our competitors,
jealously foster their merchant ma
rine. Perhaps nowhere is the need
for rapid and direct mail, passenger
and freight communication quite so
urgent as between the United States
and Latin America. We can secure
in no other quarter of the world such
immediate benefits in friendship and
commerce as would flow from the es
tablishment of direct lines of com
munication with the countries of
Latin America adequate to meet the
requirements of a rapidly increasing
appreciation of theb ree.preal depen
dence of the countries of the western
hemisphere upon each other's prod
ucts, sympathies and assistance.
"I alluded to this most important
subject in my last annual message; it
has often been before you and I need
not recapitulate the reasons for its
recommendation. Unless prompt ac
tion b' taken the completion of the
Panama canal will find this the only
great commercial nation unable to
avail in international maritime busi
ness of this great contribution to the
means of the world's commercial in
tercourse."
Governmental Expense.
To no one subject does he devote
more space than to the expense of
conducting the various government
departments and the urgent need for
economy, and in this connection he
s~ys:
"Every effort has been made by
each department chief to reduce the
estimated cost of his department for
the ensuing fiscal year ending June
30, 1912. I say this in order that con
gress may understand that these esti
mates thus made present the smallest
sum vhich will maintain the depart
ments, bureaus and offices of the. gov
ernment and meet its other obliga
tions under existing law, and that a
cut of these estimates would result
in embarrassing the executive branch
- - l
or me government mn me perrormance
of its duties. This remark does not
apply to the river and harbor esti
mates, except to those for expenses of
maintenance and the meeting of obli
gations under authorized contracts,
nor does it apply to the public build
ing bill nor to the navy building pro
gram. Of course, as to these con
gress could withhold any part or all
of the estimates for them without in
terfering with the discharge of the .or
dinary obligations of these functions
of its departments, bureaus and of
Aces.
"The final estimates for the year
ending June 80, 1-912, as they have
been sent b the treasury on Novem
ber 29 of this year, for the ordinary
expenses of the government, including
those for public buildings, rivers and
harbors, and the navy building pro
gram, amount to $630,494,013.12. This
is $52,964,887.86 less than the ap
propriations for the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1911. It is $16,883,158.44
less than the total estimates, includ
ing supplemental estimates submitted
to congress,. by the treasury for the
year 1911, and is $5,574,659.L9 less
than the original estimates submitted
by the treasury for 1911.
"These flugres do not include the
appropriations for the Panama canal,
the policy in .respect to ..which ought
to be, and is, to spend .as much. each
year as can be economically and ef
fectively expended in order to com
plete the canal as promptly as possi
ble, and therefore, the ordinary mo
tive for cutting down the expense of
the government does not apply to ap
propriations for this purpose.
"Against the estimates of expendi
tures, $640,494,013.12, we have estimat
ed receipts for next year $680,000,000,
making. a probable surplus of ordinary
receipts over ordinary expenditures of
about $50,000,000, or taking into ac
count the estimates for the Panama
canal, which are $56,920,847.69, and
which will ultimately be paid in bonds,
it will leave a deficit for the next
year of about $7,000,000, if congress
shall conclude to fortify the canal."
The Tariff.
The Preldent devotes but little
space to the subjeet of -the tarift law,
and of it he says:
"The schedules of the rates of duty
in the Payne taiff act have been sub.
je~ited to a great deal of criticism,
some of it just, more of it unfounded,
and to.,much misrepresentatin. The
act was adopted in pursuance of a
declaration. by. the:, party.. which is, re,
sponsible for it that - customs, bill
should be a tarif for the protection
of home. industries, thb mtaure.. of
the protection to be the difference be
tween the cost of,. produaog the im
ported article abroad " and the, cost of
produatrsi:It t l he'i , te.ether with
such addition to that difference as
might give a reasonable, proA to the
home: ptducer. The basis for the
criticip.. of this tarifi is that in re
spect tos, a number of the schedules
the declared measure was not follow-.
ed; but a hig-her difference retained` or
inserted by way of undue discrimina
tion in favor of certain industries and
manufactures. Little, if any, of the
criticism of the tariff has been direct
ed against the protective principle
above stated; but the main body of
the criticism has been based on the.
attempt to conform to the measure of
protection was not honestly and sin
cerely adhered to."
The Tariff Board.
The president refers to the anaolat
FHs .... •
ment of a rbed of experts to lanvest1
gate the cost .t production of varloune
articles in luded in the sohedules of
the tariff, and says:
"The tariff board thus appointed
and authorised has been diligent in
preparing itself for the necessary in.
vestigatlons. The hope of those who
hove advocated the use of this board
for tariff purposes is that the question
of the rate of a duty imposed shall
become more of a business question
and less of a political question, to be
ascertained by experts of long train
ing and accurate knowledge. The
halt in busitess and the shock to busi
ness, due to the announcement that a
new tariff bill is to be prepared and
put in operation will be avoided by
treating the schedules one by one as
occasion shall arise for a change in
the rates of each, and only after a re
port upon the schedule by the tariff
board competent to make such report.
It is not likely that the boird will be
able to make a report during the pres
ent session of congress on any of the
schedules, because a proper examina
tion involves an enormous amount of
detail and a great deal of care; but I
hope to be able at the opening of the
new congres., or at least during the
session of that congress, to bring. to
its attention the facts in regard to
those schedules in the present tariff
that may prove to need amendment."
Our Island Posseessions.
"During the last summer, at my
request, the secretary of war visited
the Philippine islands and has de
scribed his trip in the report. He
found the islands in a state of tran
quillity and growing prosperity, due
largely to the change in the tariff
laws, which has opened the markets
of America to the products of the
Philippines, and has opened the Phil
ippine markets to American manu
factures.

ity and progress in Porto Rico.

Against Wibaux County Idea
Last Saturday a Custer county
delegation was in Glendive to cor:
fer with the members of the Com
mercial Club in regard to the pro
posed organization of Wibaux coun
ty from portions of Dawson ar.d
Custer counties. Included in the
party were J. E. Prindle of Ismay,
Dr. J. P. Hledges of Ekalaka and F.
S. Warren and R. E. Morris of Ba
ker. A test vote was taken at the
Dawson County Club, resulting in a
majority of seventeen against the
segregation of Wibaux county, with
one not voting.
As the gentlemen from our neigl -
boring county are strongly interes
ted in a plan which was recently set
on foot for a division of their own
county, it may be surmised that they
heartily disappr ,ve the formation
of Wibaux county. They were great-1
ly pleased with their cordial recep
tion here.

Venerable Christian Science Leader Passes
Away at Her Beautiful Boston Home.
Boston, Dec 4.-- Mrs. Mary Baker
Eddy, the discoverer and founder
of the Christian Science, is dead.
Announcement of thie passing of
the venerable leader, which occurr
ed late last night at her home at
Chestnut Htill, was made at the
morning service of the mother
(huich in this city today.
"Natural causes" explained th'
leath, according to Dr. George L.
Nest, a district medical examiner,
who was summoned a few hours af
ter Mrs. Eddy passed away. Later
Dr. West added that the more im
mnediate cause probably was pneu
monia.
The news of Mrs. Eddy's death
was made known simultaneously by
Judge Clifford P. Smith, first rea
der of the mother church, at the
I close of the morning service, and by
Alfred Farlow, of the Christian
Science publication comniittee, in a
statement to the press.
According to Mr. Farlow, Mrs.
Eddy passed away at a quarter be
fore 11 o'clock last night.
"She had been indtisposed for
about nine days," said Mr. Farlow's
statement, "but had been up and
dressed, and as late as Thursday
transacted some business with one
of the officials of the church. She
took her daily afternoon drive until
two days before death.
Saturday night she fell quietly
asleep and those around Lhet could
at first hardly realize that she had
gone. Her thought was clear until
the last and she left no final nies
sages. No physician was in atten
dance, but she had the assistance of
students who comprised her house
hold. With her at the time of her
departure were Calvin A. F !ye,
Mrs. Laura E. Sargent, Mrs. Ella S.
Rathvon, Rev. Irving C. Tomlinson,
her corresponding secretary; Win.
R. Rathvon, and her secretary,
Adam H. Dickey.
There having been no physician in
attendance, Dr George L. AWest of
Newton Center, medical examiner
for the district, was called early
Sunday morning. Dr. West, after
investigation, promounced death due
to natural causes and issued the cu;
tomary certificate.
A telegram was sent to her son,
George W. Glover of Lead, S. I).,
apprising him of his mother's de
mise and requesting information as
to his attendance and that of his
famnilv.
Mrs. Eddy was born in Bow, N.
Ht., July 16, 1821. and was therefore
in her ninetieth year.
Few of the congregation at the
morning service today knew of Mrs.
Eddy's death. The s:ervice was as
usual, but the two readers, Judge
Smith andI Mrs. Leland T. Powers,
presented the sermon for the d(ay.
Concord, N. II., Dec. 4. -The
farm upon which Mrs. Eddy was
born J i lt 16, 1821: in the neighbor
ing town of I'ow, is a short distance
from the Concord liine, so that many
of her childhood d(ays were spent in
this city and she occasionally attend
ed the &.'d N r h Congrcg, tional
church. The housý;e in which she
was born was burned in April, 1910.
Mrs. Eddy first took up her resi
dence in this city in 1889, living on
North State street until 1892, when
she purchased the estate subsequent
ly known as Pleasant View, which is
on an eminence between the city
pr,:per and St. Paul's school. She
made many chan.,es and improve
inents on her property and lived
there until her departure to live in
the beautiful residence prepared for
her at Chestnut Hill, a Boston sub
urb.
