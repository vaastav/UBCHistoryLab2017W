in tho suppression of the nativo government
and the attempted s lbstitution of an impract

just and gracious act
Departsaent of Jostlee.
The report of the attorney general notes the
gratifying progres made by the supreme
court in overcoming tha arrears ot its busi
ness and la reachin; a condition in which it
will be able to dispose ot eases as they arise
wlthont any unreasonable delay. This result
Is of course very largely due to the successful
workinz of the plan inauturating circuit
courts of appeals. In respect to these tribun
als tha suggestion Is made ia quarters entitled
to the hhraest consideration that an addi
tional e'reuit Jnde for eaeh circuit would
greatly strengthen these courts and the
Confidence reposed In their adjudications
and that Such an addition would not create a
greater force 61 judges than the. increasing
business of such courts requires. I commend
the suggestion to the careful cdnslderatl riot
the congress. Other Important topics are"
adverted to the report accompanied bz fe'coui;
mendations. many of which have been treated
at lane in previous messages, and at this
time they need only be named. I refer to the
abolition of the fee system a a measure of
1 compensation to taderal offlccra. The en
lartement of tho powers of United State l
cemmisioners in the territories the allowance
of , writs of error in crimin il case s on behalf

with by the attorn ey general of much import
ance is the condition ef the administration of

nent solution of what is called tho Indian
problem is probably not to be expected at

Elght years ago In m? annual message I
Urged upon the congress ds strongly as t could
the location and construction of two prison
for tho confinement of United Statos p'risdn
ers A similar recommendation has beed
made from time totimi since anl a few years
ago a law was passed providing for tho selec
tion of sites for three such institutions No
appropriation has, however been made to
carry the act into effect and the old and dis
creditible condition still exists
It is not my purpose at this time to repeat
tho considerations which make an impre -nable
case in favor of tho ownership and man
agement by the government of tho penal in
institutions in which fedcr.il prisoners are
confined I simply desire to a ain urge
former recommendations on tho subject and
to particularly call tho attention or the con
gress to that part of the report of the secre
tary ot war. In which ho states thnt the mil
itary prison at Fort Leavenworth. Kansas,
can bo turned ovor to to tho government as a
prison for federal convicts without the, leas
difficulty and with an actual saving or money
from every point of view
Pending a more complete rerorm, I hope
that by tho adoption of the suggestion of tho
secretary of war this easy step may be tiken
in the diroction or tho proper care of its con
victs by tne government of the Unite 1 States
I'ostnl anil Navy Departments.
The message next tikes up tho report or tho
postmaster general and stron ly urges tlid
recommendations of that ofn.-ial looking to
the correction of the abuse of the scconl
class mail matter privilege by publishers ot
advertisin; matter, who send ton of papers
through the mill and defraud tho government
out of millions of dollars posta;e annually.
The freo carriage of seeds of grain throu h
the mails Is also condemned If the-e abuses
were recttflod tho department would be self
sustaining. The report of the postmaster
general, which has already been published, is
reviewed at length.
Attention is called to the report of the sec
retary of tho navy which shows very gratify
ing progrcs in the construction of ships for
our new navy.
I recommend that provision be nude for tho
construction of additional battle ships and
torpedo boats The secretary recommend
the manufacture not only or a reserve supply
of ordnance and ordnance mat eri il for ship;
of the navy but also a supply for the auxil
iary fleet Guns and their apurtennnees
should be provided and kept on hand for both
those purposes We hav3 not to-day a single
gun that could be put upon the ship3 Paris or
New York of the International Navi -ntioa
company or any other ship of our reserve

Interior Department.
The report of the secret iry of the intcr:ot
exhibits tho situitlon or the numerous and in
teresting branches of tha public serUcc con
nected with his department I recommend
this report and tho valuable recommenda
tions of the secretary to tho careful att-ntion
of congress
I fully indorse the recommend it 'on of the
secretary that adequate protection be pro
vided for our forest reserves and that a com
prehensive forestry system be inaugurated
The rocommendatl-ms of tho secretary in
regard to dealing with fio Indian question is
concurred in and ha already been published
Pensions.
The barefaced and extensive pension frauds
exposed under tho courageous and i cnerous
veteran soldier now at the head of the bureau
leaves no room for the claim that no purgation
of our pension roll was needed or thnt con
tinued vi.ilunce and prompt action arc not
necessary to the same end '1 ho accusation
that an effort to detect pension frauds is evi
dence of unfriendliness towards our
worthy veterans and a denial or their
claims to the generosity of tho gov
ernment, suggests an unfortunate Indiffer
ence to the comlssion of any offense which
has for its motive the securin; or a pension
and indicates a willingness to be blind to the
existence or mcjn and trcachers us crimes
which play upon demagogic fears and make
sport of tho patriotic peopio.
Agricultural Department.
The secretary of agriculture in his report
reviews tho operations of his department for
the last fiscal year and make recommenda
tions for the further extension of its useful
ness Tho recommendations of the senate
are concurred in The prohibition of free dis
tribution of seed by the department is again
urged.
The work done by the department of a ri
culture is very superficially slcalt with in thi
communication and I commend the report of
the secretary and the very important inter
ests with which it deals to tho careful atten
tion of tho congress
Anexceedin;ly important rccommendat on
of tho secretary relates to the manner in
which contests and litigated cases -rowin
out of efforts to obtain government land nre
determined. Tho entire testimony up-n
which these controversies depend in all their
stages is taken before the local recister.s
and receivers and yet these officers havo no
power to subpoena witnesses or to enfocse
their attendance to testify These caos,
numbering three or four thousand annunllv
are ent by the officers to the commissioner
of the general land office for his action. The
exesencies of his other duties obli.-e him to
act upon decisions of the registers and re
ceivers without an opportucity of thorough
personnl examination. Nearly 20)) of theso
case s are appealed annually from the commis
sioner to the secretary ot the interior Burden
ed with other important administrative duties,
his determination of thoe appeals must be
almost perfunctionary and,baed upon the ex
amination of others. Throu h this determln i
tion of the secretary operates as final adjudica
tion upen richts of very Importance. 1 concur
In tho opinion thit the commissioner of tin
general land office should be relieved from
this duty of deciding liti;ated land case that
a non-pnrtlsan court should be entreated to
pass on such cases and that the decisions of
this court should be final at least so far a
the decisions or tho department are flnaL
Civil Service Rerorm.
Tho advantages to the public service of an
adherence to the principles or civil service
reform are constantly more apparent an l
nothing is so encouraging to those in official
life who honestly desire good government as
the increasing appreciation by oar people of
these advantages A vast majority of the
voters of tho land are ready to insist
that tho time and tho attention of
those they select to perform for
them important public duties, should not be
distributed by doling out minor offices and
they are growing to be unanimoas in regard
ing party or anizations as something thit
should be used in establishing pm ty principle
instead of dictating the distribution of public
places as rewards of partisan activity
Numerous additional offices and place havo
been brought within civil service rule and
regulation and some others will probab y
soon be included. The report of the comm s
sloncrs will be submitted to the congress and
I invite careful attention to the recommen

Scribner's Magazine: An Indian ha&
fbeen known to carry a letter from
i'.iu aa pares to Chihuahua and back
again in five days, the distance being
nearly 800 miles. In some parts where
the Tarahumaris serve the Mexicans
;they are used to run in the wild horses,
.driving them into corral; it may take
them two or three days to do it, sleep
ting at night and living on a little pin
ole. They bring in the horses thorough
ly exhausted, while they themselves
are still fresh. They will outrun any
horse if you give them time enough.
They will pursue deer in the snow, or
with dogs, in the rain, for days and
days, until at last the animal is corner
ed and shot with arrors. or falls an
easy prey from sheer exhaustion, its
hoofs dropping off.
