IS RECOMMENDED
Mr. Wilson for Second
Time Fails to Go
to Capitol.
For the second time since he entered
the White House, President Wilson today
transmitted his annual message
to Congress by messenger and did not
appear in person.
It was not untH within two or three
hours of the time set for the convening
of Congress that President Wilson
definitely stated that he would not go
to the Capitol to read his message. In
making his decision he told Admiral
Grayson, his personal physician, who.
* with others of his intimates, has been
advising him against the trip, that he
thought it best to remain at home, and
he would, therefore, "follow the doctor's
advice."
The President's concrete recommendations
to Congress were:
Revision of the tax laws with
simplification or tne income ana
profits taxes.
Independence for the Philippines^
A loan to Armenia.
Economy in government appropriations
and expenditures and creation
of a "workable" budget system.
Cold storage and other laws affecting
the cost of living, and the federal
licensing of corporations as
recommended in previous messages.
> Rehabilitation and training of disabled
soldiers and sailora The President
did not indorse a bonus.
Silent an to League.
Nowhere did the President refer to
the league of nations or the peace
treaty fight, except perhaps by inference
in his opening, when he
quoted Abraham Lincoln, "let us have
faith that right, makes might, and
la that faith let qs dare to do our
duty as we understand it"
At its close thS President wrote a
paragraph which Might be regarded
as a valedictory. saying:
"I have not so much laid before yen
a. series of recommendations as sought
tj? utter a confession of faith, of the
faith of which I was bred and which

TEXT OF RECON
MADE BY C
The text of the President's annual
message to Congress follows:
Gentlemen of the Congress:
When I addressed myself to performing
the duty laid upon the
President by the Constitution to
present to you in an annual report
Offt fha a?afa th? TTtiion. I fOUnd
"by thought dominated by an immortal
sentence of Abraham Lincoin's:
"Let us have faith that right
makes might, and in that faith let
us dare to do our duty as we understand
it"
A sentence immortal because it
embodies in a form of utter simplicity
-and purity the essential
faith of the nation, the faith in
which it was conceived and the
faith in which it has grown to
glory and power. With that faith
and the birth of a nation founded
upon it came the hope into the
world that a new order would prevail
throughout the affairs of manKind,
an order-in which reason .
_ and right would take precedence
-of covetousneas-and-force, and I
believe . that I express the . wish
aiid purpose, of every thoughtful
American when I say that this
sentence marks for us in the plainest
manner the part we should
play alike in the arrangement of
our domestic affairs and in our
exercise of influence upon the af- I
fairs of the world. By this faith,
and by this faith alone, can the
world be lifted out of its present
confusion and despair. It was
this faith which prevailed over the
wicked force of Germany. Tou
will remember that the beginning
of the end of the war came when
the German * people found them- |
selvea face to face with the conscience
of the world and realised :
that right was everywhere arrayed
against the wrong that their gov- |
ernmeat was attempting to perpetrate.
I think, therefore, that it
is true to say urn >ua --faith
which won the war. Certainly
this ia the faith with which
our gallant man went Into the Held
and out upon th* aeao to make
sore of victory. j

of the multitude. This Is the
time of *U others when democracy
should prove its puniy ana in
iptrjtntl power to prevail. It la
surely the manifest destiny of the
United States to. lead In the attempt
to make this spirit prevail.
There are two ways la which the
United States can assist to accomplish
this great object: First, by
offetihg the example within her
own borders of the' will and power
of democracy to make and enforce
laws which are unquestionably just
and which are equal in their administration
? laws which secure
its full right to labor ebd yet at
the same time safeguard the integrity
of property, and particularly
of that property which is
devoted to the development of industry
and the increase of the necessary
wealth of the world. Second,
by standing for right and
Justice as toward individual nations.
The law of democracy 'is
for the protection of the weak, and
the influence of every democracy
in the world should be for the protection
of the weak nation,, the nation
which is struggling toward its
right and toward its proper' recogognitlon
and privilege in the family
of nations.
The United 8tates cannot refuse

President-elect Harding's show of
independence in his farewell speech
at the Senate is the talk of the National
Capital.
It wasn't co much the impressive
way by which the departing senator
appealed to his colleagues for oo-op>
eration, but the very clear-out emphasis
which he placed upon the pewera
of the executive that caught the
ear of political Washington and
promptly set everybody gossiping as

t It is a fact, for instance, that when

were almost unanimously against the
idea of his making a speech at all.
Some suggested that It would be indelicate
for him to address the Senate
in his present position.

*t*i?9k lilt? urucio Alt WUIIvi. w*.
Great Britain and the arbitrary
Napoleonic decrees which involved
us in what we know as the war
of 1812. I urge you to consider
that the display of an immediate
disposition on the part of the
Congress to remedy any injustices
or evils that may have shown
> themselves in our own national
life will afford the most effectual
ofTset to the forces of chaos and
tyranny which are playing so disastrous
a part in the fortunes of
the free peoples of more than one
part of the world. The United
States is of necessity the sample
democracy of the world, and the
triumph of democracy depends '
upon its success.
Recovery Has Been Slaw.
Recovery from the .disturbing
and sometimes disastrous effects
of the late war has been exceedingly
slow on the other aide of
the water and has given promise,
I venture to say, of early completion
only in our own fortunate
country; but even with us the re- .
covery halts and is impeded at |
times and there are immediately I
serviceable acts of legislation I
wnicn it seems to me we ougni
to attempt, to assist that recovery
and prove the indestructible
recuperative force of a great government
of the people. One of
these is to prove that a great
democracy can keep house as sue
cessfully and in as businesslike I
a ftjshton as any other government.
It seems to me that the first step
toward proving this is to supply
ourselves with a systematic meth- t
od" of handling our estimates and
expenditures anf bringing them to .
the point where they will not be t
an unnecessary strain upon our in- i
come or necessitate unreasonable t
taxation?In other words, a work- ,
able budget system, and I respect- c
fully suggest that' two elements
are essential to such a system; '
namely, not only that the proposal J
of appropriations should he tto the <j
hands of a limit body, such as a
atafta ?p pro r Is Opus committee in
esch house of the Congress but
also that thla Mr shodld ba
brtufbt into aneh sa^adi alien =

ermuepl and with the Treasury of
tne United Stated aa weald enable ,
H to "p41 upon a complete conspectus
of the needs of the poiremmept
and th^ resources from which
it must draw Its Income. I reluctantly
vdtoed the bodret bill
passed, by . the last .session of the
Cqnpreaa- because of a constitutional
objection. The. Home -of
Representatives subsequently modified
the bill In. order to mdpt this
abjection. la the revised form I
believe that the hill, couplhd with
action already taken by the Conareas
to revise its rules and procedure,
furnishes the foundations
for an effective national bud set
system. I earnestly hope, therefore,
that one of the first step?
taken .by the present session of the
Congress will bo to pass the bud-'
*et bill.
Finances Have Improved.
The nation's finances have shown I
marked Improvement during the
paat year. The total ordinary receipts
. of $M?4.000,000 for the
| nscai year ii:u exceeaea. imm 1
for 1919 by $l,r.42,000,000, while
the total net ordinary expenditures
decreased from $13,514,.
000,006 to $0,403,000,000. The
cross public debt, which reached 1
its highest point on 31 August,
1910, when it was $20,690,000,000, 1
had dropped on 30 ^ November, I
1920, to $24.175,000.000.' There has <
also been a marked decrease in <
holdings of government war se- '
curities by the banking institu- {
tlons of the country, as well as in i
the amount of bills held by the 1
federal reserve banks secured by .
government war obligations. This t
fortunate result has relieved the i
banks and left them freer to j
finance the .needs of agriculture, j
industry and commerce. It has l
been due in large pail to the re- i

He gave a gentle warning that anything

more or less humorously to Gov. Cox's
phrase?"a Senate oligarchy"?but
the significant thing is that he saw
fit .to bring the phrase-back into this
particular speech at all. Those who
know Mr. Harding's mind .say he wanted
to take occasion to appeal to 1
his friends not to presume too much,
not to make his task hard simply because
he had grown, so intimate with
his colleagues in the Senate. . i
Moreover, he wanted to remove any \
suggestion that the Senate would con- 1

been so annoylngly suggested from i
time to. time, not by democrats alone,

' Congressional investigation of

Military Committee
Members Call Baker to
Make Explanation.
Secretary Baker was asked today
ty the House military committee to
appear before it Friday to explain
vhy the War Department has recruited
an Army of more than 110,000
nen.
Representative Kahn of California,
chairman of the House military afairs
committee, said that some of
ts members felt that the War Decartment
had broken faith with the
committee.
He explained that funds were apropriated
sufficient to maintain an
rmy of not more than ISO,000 men
urlng the current fiscal year with
he understanding that such a force
rould be sufficient, although under
he Army reorganisation act the maxmum
strength of the Army was fixed
,t 280,000.
Reports to the committee, Mr. Kahn
eclared, indicate that the Army now
Sproxlmates 210,000 men and that
orts are being made to reach' the
80,000 maximum.
If this were done, according to Mr.
Cahn. a deficit of at least $180,000,000
rould be incurred. Appropriations for
.11 Army purposes for the fiscal year
nding next June 30 totaled approxlnately
$392,000,000. For the coming

HARDING LISTENS
KIFHIFBSTIIK
nu luiuliiu inui
Two Indications of Policy
Seen at President-Elect's
Conferences.
BT If. O, HEMEKGEB.
Out of the visit of President-elect
Harding to Washington come only two
definite indications of policy?first, that
when President he will call Congress
in extraordinary session some time in
March, and second, that it is his desire
that the republicans in control of the
House and Senate shall olose up all
the routine business of this session in
nod-partisan spirit, and leave the legislative
decks clepr for the next session.
The only flat statement that Senator
Harding made, -for literal quotation,
say he was not considering divers and
aaqdcy gentlemen, and the gossip od>
the .day centered about names heretofore
mentioned.
Id Attentive Listener.
The President-elect, la the dottfde o*
the interviews held with promM?ht republicans
in and out of Congress, is
described as having been an attentive
listener rather than a voluble contributor
to the talk. He acquired a
voluminous stock of -suggestions, upon
which he may.'rnminate hereafter.
His attitude might -be . likened- to
that, of Chief Justice White when a
motion is presented in court, "We
Will take the papers, thank you." He
has a good two months, and- a half in
wnicb to pms - judgment upon tnese
and. other propositions to be sub*
mitted.
Senators and representatives found
most satisfaction in his assursnoe
that as President he will scrupulously
recognise the respective functions of
the executive and legislative branches
of the government. He took especial
pains to point out that he would not
abate his own prerogatives as President
of the United States, but instead
will be sealous of them.
Agree With Declaration.
Congressmen find no fault with that
declaration, it is as it should be, they
say. They are mightily pleased, how- I
ever, with his assurance In advance that
there will be team work between the
executive and the Congress and that
the executive will not be set paramount
to the functions of the legislative
branch.
President-elect Harding's cordiality
and entire freedom from aloofness or a j
spirit of stiffness was commented upon
by all who came in contact with htm.
His colleagues of the Senate found no
change in the man as result of his
change in official status.
Resultant from the trend of the inquiries
made by him of those with
whom he talked. It was deduced that
domestic and economic questions will i
concern him quite as much in the period
Elapsing before his accession to the
presidential office' as the 'much mooted
league of nations. In fact, it would

This was the principal Item on the t
agenda, having' been brought into a
prominence by. the decision yesterday r
of the committee on admission of new "
states.
The assembly also continued the ,
work of laying a working basis for _
the league which would enable it to

tors and note the practical effects of f

"The assembly has no pdwex to modi- C
fy decisions coining wifhip the excln- h
sive conpetance Of toe council." . p
The commitiM decided to recommend h
that the whole paragraph be dropped a
from the report rather than protons a
discussion which might be fruitless. C
Work in the typhus campaign now P
going on in Poland, and.plans looking t
to the welfare- of children in Europe h
were also discussed today.
One of the early acts of the assem- '
bly this morning.was to approve the 11
decision of the committee on relations P
between the assembly and the council 11
for the elimination of the entire para- f
graph of Its report- which provided J
that the assembly had no power to 4
take up questions within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the council.
Delegate Rowell of Canada, who t<
made the report, pointed out that the a
elimination did not change the present j
situation. The report, being merely r
Interpretative, could not change the s
relations between the council and the <,
assembly, he remarked, but was mere
ly explanatory of the provisions of v
the covenant.
Sir GFeorge E. Foster of the Canadian g
delegation stirred the assembly^oy an ?
eloquent appeal for action against i,
typhus in Poland and the near east v
in general. Canada and Slam, he re- .
marked,?were the only countries that -e
responded with cash contributions to f.
the call of the council for aid.
Appeals for Belief. h
""Let it hot be said that the floodgates JJ
of sympathy are closed," he cried. 1
"Let it not be said that the sensibilities R
of the world have been dulled to such
imperative calls." 41
A member of the Indian delegation, 5
the Prince of Navanagar, added to Sir d
George's appeal by giving a vivid de- 8
scription of the ravages of typhus in ?
the east. He declared the world was d
facing in this a graver emergency than
the situation in Armenia. p
A member of the Norwegian legation ti
said that the typhus could be effective- 1<
ly fought with the price of two torpedo
boat destroyers. He proposed the naming
of a committee to get the money.
Sir George Foster's reminder to the *
assembly that much had been promised ?
in aid of the anti-typhus campaign, but n
that little had been paid except by Siara n
and Canada, produced a decided reao- tl
tion among the delegates. Represents- b
tives of nations in all corners of the n
world succeeded one another at the
speaker's stand to give assurance of li
their co-operation in the work. g
Announcement was made today that I
Honorio Pueyhredon, head of the Ar- 8
gentine delegation, which has withdrawn ir
from the assembly of the league of na
tions, win -leave ueneva tonight. It ci
was said at the Argentine headquarters ri
this morning that the rest of the dele- si
gation would depart tomorrow. g
FOR ASSEMBLY TO DECIDE *
IF ARGENTINIANS RETURN "
By Gable to The Star and Chicago Daily News.
GENEVA, December 7.?The Argen- ^
tine delegation, which has withdrawn n
from the league of nations, will leave
for Paris tomorrow. Foreign Minister
Pueyrredon, an Argentine delegate,
said to the -writer today:
"It is for the assembly to decide if _
Argentina is to return. We are leav- ?
ing for the fundamental reason that
the league refused to discuss two
propositions tending to make the
league universal and the states equal
before the league. Our propositions it
were disposed of by the rules of pro- f(
cedure. Argentina acted alone, not Ui
wishing to compromise the French or ai
British position or to influence the c<
other South American states.
"Our only object was to make the tt
league a. regl living league for all. a
