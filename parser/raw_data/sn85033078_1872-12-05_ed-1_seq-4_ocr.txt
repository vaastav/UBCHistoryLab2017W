'.Wdrer, one month ago we vacated
•the editorial chair for the purpose of
visiting our friends and taking a little
rest, the election was over, and all over
i the country the lightning nerves of wire
.were thrilling the people with the jgy-i
r fnl intelligence of a bloodless ewlCest
ended and a bloodless vicUwy won.
To our city the glorious news had not
yet come how the great states had so
nobly stood by the government and j
emphatically denounced a movement
whose origin was deep down in the,
hearts of misled and infatuated men.
We went otlr way and in a lew days
we "received a copy of th. I’,( porter—
our paper and read —“ The election it
over carried fur (Irani by //icon* the
mutt corrupt, ditgrare/al, damnable
that ever ilithonored our nation, etc.,
etr." —We threw down our paper in
disgust, we re-read the “damning lie”
and thought, are we again slaughtered
in the house of our friends V Andj
then we thought how grandly the old
Keystone slate had placed the seal of
righteousness upon the common verdict
rendered by the grandest jury ever
empanelled, and we were satisfied, lay
ing nothing ]) against him who so in
discreetly had wounded us in body and
mind, knowing that many things are
penned in the heat of excitement that

Readers of Che Reporter : Our prin
ciples are to-day tin- szmo as a month
ago,—we have never surrendered them,

Horace Greeley Dead.
The painful rumor reaches us, au
thenticated, that Horace Greeley is
dead. Humors have been rife for scv-i
oral woAs that Mr. Greeley hud been]
suffering from severe nervous proslru-j
tion ; that he was insane, and liable to I
be taken off at any’ time. Those havei
been repeatedly contradicted, but the!
telegraph brings us the unmistakable
fact that Horace Greeley is dead. Mr j
Greeley * death waa undoubtedly has
tened by th(> anguish experienced hv
the loss of his wife, though wo verily j
believe the intense excitement and eon-1
slant wear upon n system such as his, '
by the continued and unremitting ex-!
citements of a campaign, such as hasj
just terminated, has had very much to i
do with his decease.
The whole nation will mourn the loss j
of Mr. Greeley, even those who j
were his bitterest political enemies, will
feel pangs of sorrow as they think of
the great light that has gone out from
the earth forever.
We shall hear more in connection
with his death and burial soon, which
wu will give our readers in our next
issue,

—We clip the following from the

cent "corner” in North-western R. U.
stock, on Wall Street. It is amusing
to an outsider, who has not a cent to
gain or lose in the fluctuations oi
stocks, to watch the grappling* of the
Hulls with the Bears, and vice vena.
In the recent contest, where millions
were staked and lost or won, by the
manipulations of wily gamblers, whose
money makes their iniquity honorable,
three noted personages figured to an
extent hitherto unknown in the history
of H. R. Stock gambling, viz.: Vander
bilt, Gould and Drew. Drew, it seems,
was worsted but will recover with a
slight loss of only -.700,000 dollars.
Vanderbilt has been endeavoring to
got possession of the Chicago and
Northwestern I! K, and without doubt
will be successful. Undoubtedly such

and scalping knife with the intention I
of butchering Tracy, but it is uncertain i
whether ho has succeeded in getting j
Tracy’s whole scalp.
In sumo respects wc sympathize with
Tracy; because if the Tracy regime
continues in power, it is quite sure the

season. But it is not certain what

of his instruments should be placed at

I give us what we are now deprived of
through an unjust discrimination,
namely, the natural advantages of our
position. The market price of wheat
and corn is always in our favor, but
our superiority in this regard has been
neutralized by the low rates at which
freight has been taken to Chicago by
the Northwestern R. R.

soil and mine, to be held at Philadel
phia, in 1870, and has appointed a
Commission, consisting of representa
thes from each State and Territory, to
conduct the celebration.
Wiginating under the auspices of
the. National Legislature, controlled by
a National Commission, and designed
as Ltds to “Commemorate the first Cen
tury of our existence by an exhibition
of The natural resources of the country
and their development, and of our pro
gress in those art* which benefit man
kind, fn 'fibrilpurison with those of old

that the Commission look for the aid
which is ncsessary to wake the. Centen

That the completion of the first ccn

people of the. whole -country. Tlie
Congress of the United States has
wisely decided that the birth-day of
the Great Republic can be most fitingly
celebrated by the universal collection
and display of all the trophies of its
progress. It is designed to bring
I together, with.n a building covering
i fifty acres, not only the varied produc
tions of our mines and of our soil, but
types of all live intellectual triumphs of
| our citizens, specimens of everything
j that America, can furnish, whether
| from the brains or the bauds of her
I children, and thus make evident to the
i world the advancement of which a
j self govfifrtcd people is capable,
j In this ‘Celebration” all nations
| will he invited to participate,; its char

display her arts and manufactures,
India her curious ftihrics, while newly
! opened China artel Japan Will lay ha e
j the treasures which for centuries their
: ingenious poopl have been perfecting.
I Each land will compete in generous ri
i valry for the palm of superior exoel

To this grand gatin'ring every xWne
will contribute its fruits and cerertls.
,No mineral shall wanting; for what
ho Egst lacks the Wist will supply.
I 'tide* one roof will the South display j
in rich luxuriance her growing cotton, i
and the North in mini at dm, the erase-j

that cotton into cloth. Each section
of tlie globe will send its best offerings
to this exhibition, and each State of
the Union, as a member of wjc united
body politic, will show to her sister
States and to the world, how much she
I can add to the greatness of the nation

j To make the Centennial Celebration
eh a success as the patriotism and
the nride cf every American demands
will require the co-operation of the
people m th" whole country. The
I nited States Cmfcnnial Commission
has received no government aid. such
as England extenu ‘d to her V\ orld s
Fair, and France to i.nr Universal Ex
position, yet the labor u'td responsibili
ty imposed upon the Coim/ission is as
great as either of those unu. ’’takings.
It is estimated that ten millions at dol
lars will be required, and this sum
Congress has provided shall be i.’scd
by stock subscription, and that the peo
ple shall have the opportunity of sub
scribing in proportion to, the popula
tion ot their respective States and
Territories.
The Commission looks to the unfail
ing patriotism of the people ot every
section, to see that each contributes its
share to the expencos. and receives its
share of the benefits of an enterprise'
in which all are so deeply interested, j
!t would further earnestly urge the for
mation in each State and Territoty of j
a centennial organisation, which shall!
in time ?eo that the county associations i
are formed, so that when the nations j
are gathered together in 187.5 each.
Commonwealth can view with pride the
contributions she has made to tlie na
tional glory,
Confidently relying on the seal and :
patriotism ever displayed by our peo
ple in every national undertaking, we
pledge and prophecy that the Centen
