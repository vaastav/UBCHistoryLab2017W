SPORTING...
...BREVITIES
The American Association moguls
will hold their annual meeting in
Chicago next Saturday.
Several of the New York (Hants
have taken up push bull as a winter
recreation. , That's an Improvement
on the high ball.
Fred W. Swinn has been elected
captain of the Iowa foot ball team.
He has been three years on the
eleven, and is a student of dentistry.
Bicycle racing has lost none of its
old time popularity. The attendance
at the preliminary events in New
York was the largest in the history
of the racing game In Gotham.
The latest college to talk of drop
ping foot hall unless the rules are
modified is Northwestern. At a meet
ing of the trustees many or the worst
features were attacked. Final action
will be taken on the matter after the
holidays.
Boston is going to get into the
fighting game this winter. Clubs are
being organized with a convenient
and elastic membership role that
should successfully drive through the
loophole in the law that permits of
private clubs holding six round box
ing bouts.
Champion Jeffries weighs close on
to 260 pounds, ami at the present
ratio ')f increase he should tip the
scales at 300 pounds within two years.
Farm life is agreeing with the big
fellow, and the enthusiasts who have
lieen trying to coax him back into the
ring have given up the task as hope
less. The fighting game is a funny busi
ness. Tommy Ryan was signed up
to manage Marvin Hart, and now
Jack Curley has been engaged to
manage Marvin Hart and Tommy
Ryan. A manager for Hart, Ryan
and Curley will probably be next In
order. It takes nine tailors to make
at man. Can nine managers make a
chaiupwin oiit of this bunch?
The New Orleans turf war is taking
on a tinge of the picturesque. Kree
admission tickets t" the tracks are
leaves on I lie banks of the Vallom
lirosa. hundreds of horses are still
coming, the purses are liberal, the
lietting large, untl as the horses oc
caai'Miully run true to form the ring
follower get some show for their
coin. There Is little likelihood of a
compromise. j
Eastern sports put little faith in j
the claim that McGovern and Nelson
will meet at rhiladelphia early next
year. Nelson is making il,f00 a
week on the stage, and he would be
foolish ie ia s it up for a chance
to le defeated by McGovern. Nelson
would have little to gain in such a
fight, while lie would lose every bit
of his prestige should he be de
feated. Now t hat General Nelson A. Miles,
V. S. A., retired, has written a series
or articles declaring foot ball "brutal,
' degrading and deadly." It is In order
for Mr. Hurry Up" Yost or some of
his kind io dash off a few stirring
paragraphs on flamboyant militarism
as exemplified in peacock uniforms,
and why .Miles stayed at home when
Shafter swung in his hammock under
a Cuban sky. General Miles should
have been on the alert for a low
tackle.
The assembly room was crowded I
wit h students. On the front seals
were the members of the victorious
foot ball nam. Prof. Yeldah was dis
coursing on the evils of foot ball:
"I am sorry to see the game," he said,
"has deteriorated. The charge of pro
fessionalism is heard. It is said bru-
tality is practiced in the mass play,
The paid coach Is blamed for many
of the evils. I understand a number
of accidents have occurred. A de
mand is being made for a modification
of the rules. You. young gentlemen
who have won victories on the grid
iron arc still covered with ndhesive
plaster and exude the odor of llnla
ment. Several of you are known to
me personally, but I have been unable
to recognic you as you are ntjw
adorned. I have the word of Coach
Yost that the game has lost, much of
Its invigorating Interest. Coach Held
tells me the rules should he modified
by eliminating the number of subs on
the side lines. I understand that
Quarterback Stevenson of Pennsyl
vania favors a development of the
short arm punch in I he scrimmage
as an inetntive to greater freedom of
action. I hear several colleges have
abandoned the game. I also favor iis
abolishment in th,. months inclusive
from December 1 to November 1.
All
those who favor such abolishment of
the game will answer aye. Contrary,
no. I am pleased to note that the de
cision is unanimous. Let us all rise
and sing."

PRESIDENT'S VICTORY IN FAVOR
OF RAILWAY RATE LEGISLATION
The Session Will be Short One-Senate Will Pass
Railway Hill Pleasing to the President
Without Any Prolonged Struggle.
PROSPECT IS QUITE BRILLIANT FOR JOINT STATEHOOD
Special to The Evening CltiJtc:'.
Washington, D. C, lec. tl. Great
Is the force of public opinion. There
are accumulating evidences that il
lias enabled Theodore Roosevelt to
win a victory over the United States
senate, It would seem almost safe
to make a positive prediction that a
law for the federal regulation or rail
way rates, acceptable to the presi
dent, will bo enacted at the present
session of congress.
He would have been deemed a fool
ish man who would have ventured
such a prediction a month ago. Even
a week ago there were all the signs
of an Impending fight of huge pro
portions. Ground began to give way
under the opposition when Speaker
Cannon entered into a compact with
the White House, assuring that the
administration's rate bill would
promptly pass the representative
branch of congress. This compact
forced the railroads Into a count of
senate noses and while there has
been no public announcement of their
canvass, it is evident that the count
was favorable to the president and
the people.
It would not be fair to say that
Mr. Roosevelt was compromised. He
will si and or fall by the essential
principles of the Ksch-Townsend bill.
but he has made it plain in his mes
sage to congress that he is not going
to be a stickler for minor details.
This offered the railroad senators a
graceful line of retreat. Mr. Roose
velt having shown a disposition to be
"reasonable," they say, there is no
reason why a rale bill, equitable and
just to all parties, cannot bo agreed
upon. This enables the senate to save
its face, antl at the saule time avoid
bumping up against a firmly fixed
public sentiment.
EARLY ADJOURNMENT
IS ALMOST CERTAIN.
Mr. Kooseveit will get the credit of
a victory, uf course; and there is
none will deny that, much credit is his
due. it is nut Mr. Roosevelt, how
ever, who has pumnieled the senate
into a state of complaisance. Had
it. not boon for an almost unanimous
public opinion back of him, he would
have been as helpless as a babe bo
fore the trained and seasoned manip
ulators of the senate inner circle.
If the railroad rate question is as
happily disposed of as now seems
likely, the session may he unusually
short instead of unusually long.
Speaker Cannon has fixed upon June
1st as a desirable .time for adjourn
ment, and thinks the business cuu be
wound up by that )ate. The speaker
is an expert on legislative schedules,
and his belief that the work can be
finished iy the end of May is en
titled to most respectful considera
tion. The only obstacle is possible
obstruction of some kind in the sen
ate. TARIFF REVISION WILL
NOT PROLONG SESSION.
It Is well understood that, when au
adjournment day is in sight, the pres
ident will send a tariff revision mes
sage to congress. The program is
"to file It for future reference." and
the message will not, therefore, have
any serious bearing on the question
of adjournment. The bouse democrats
i will find a good many pretexts to talk
tariff revision bet ween no v ,ini next
! June, but their oratory will not lu-
lerlete with the business of the
I house. Whenever the press dispatches
j announce lliui a tariff debate is
t raging, it can bo accepted as con
clusive thai the house has time not
needed for the actual transaction of
business.
All tin- important legislation to be
enacted at this session will he per
fected in committee and will have the
final uvownicnt of the house rulers
before it ever becomes the subejet of
public debate., .lust by way of keep
ing his "boys" in good humor, "Uncle
Joe" lets thtn talk when there is no
possible chance that their arguments
can influence the final result. This
prevents discontent and furnimhes
eloquence for home consumption. So
when the house Is talking tariff,
therefore. Just remember that Speak
er Cannon and his lieutenants are off
In some secluded committee room de
ciding which measures shall and
which shall not pass and that the
public fireworks have no real sig
nificance. PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD
CUTS OFF FREE PASSES.
The president's message was pub
lished in the newspapers of Wedsnes
day morning which senators and rep
resentatives read, but it wasn't the
message which caused them to con-
fer in gloomy
Ilttle groups. The
cause of their woe was a dispatch
under Philadelphia date which an
nounced that tile Pennsylvania rail
road company bail decided to discon
tinue all formy of free transportation,
ii being inude plain that senators and
j representai i s are prominent anion
those who will h;ie to pay cash lo
travel after January 1st.
That was b, el enough; too bad.
in fait, but tlie siuii! dispatch con
tained i he furihcr announcement that
other mails wci likely to follow luc
lead of the I'eiisj lvania. Think what
it would mean to statesmen from the
Pacific coasts were the non-pass rule
to become generally effective; It is
true, of course, that a generous con
gress allows Its own members four
cell I a a mile for traveling expenses,
and that it doesn't cost iheiu much
more than half that much for rail
road fare, hut that doesn't make it
anv easier. In the past, those who
traveled on passes were aide lo make
a clean pickup of their mileage allow
ance. It will be itiletes'ing to watch the
clfc i of the non-pass rule mi the at
titude uf congress towards ihe rail
roads. Tlie iviinsvlvania railroad
tln
I
lias I u able lo command
majority of votes in both senate
and house, whenever it really needed
the vois. nud free transportation has
played no small part in enabling il
to eeit ibis moral influence.
It has been the occasion of no little I
remark a' the cnpitol Ibis week that1
Ihe no-pa-s older was issue. I inline- '
diaiely ntier it In came practically
ci iihiii thai a railroad rate bill would i
be enacted More than one member
fell quite aggrieved, on the score
that
was being punished for something
couldn't really help.
FAVORABLE TO JOINTURE
IS CHAIRMAN 'AMILTON.
The four territories seeking ad
mission into the sisterhood of states
have a staunch and I rue friend In
Representative Hamilton of Michi
gan, chairman of the house commit
tee on territories. He is the earnest
champion, at leasl, of those who
favor the erection of two states out
of the four territories.
Mr. Hamilton has re-introduced bis
Rtatehood bill in substantially the
form It was before the last congress.
It provides for two states, one created
out of Arizona and New Mexico, and
known as Arizona, and one erected
out of Oklalmma and Indian Terrti
tory, to be known as Oklahoma. It
contains no provision respecting the
regulation of the liquor traffic, that
having been au amendment which the
senate added to the last statehood
bill.
ECONOMY IS THE WORD.
XND NO PUBLIC BUILDINGS.
During the first week of the ses
sion the usual number of hills carry
ing appropriations for public build
ings have been introduced. 11 is
even possible that there have been
a few more than the usual number.
There are going to be a lot of dis
appointed cities: for there is hardly
the remotest chance that a public
building 1)111 will pass. There will be
appropriations, of course, for contin
uing work on buildings now under
way, but. it will probably be carried
in the sundry civil bill. Speaker
Cannon has set his face firm against
any new public building - projects,
however, and has refused to listen to
anxious members who have sought to
plead with him. ,
The killing off of all new public
building projects is one of the Speak
er's schemes of wiping out the treas
ury deficit.
Undeterred by the announcement
that economy is to be tile watchword
of the present session, the promoters
of the Jamestown exposition are ser
enely asking for $2.ono.linn as the gov
ernment's contribution to that new
project.
There Isn't any chance of their get
ting 2,ii(Mi.iMHi, and Representative
Maynard of Virginia, the exposition's
sponser In the house, doesn't expect
any such sum. Ho argues, with the
small boy's irrefutable logic, how
ever, that he will come nearer hitting
the moon by trying than if he didn't
shoot at all: nnd there Is the further
consideration that, whatever sum the
exposition does succeed in getting
will appear modest alongside what
was asked.'
ENEMY OF FREE SEEDS
FOOLISHLY PROMINENT
Representation Morris Sheppard,
the youthful and exubrant member of
the house from the Kirst Texas dis
trict, is the relentless and implacable
foe of free seeds for the American
farmer. He sought In the hist con
gress l so amend the agricultural
appropriation bill as to cut out the
seed allowance. His vole was the
only one in support of the amend
ment. He comes forward bright and early
in the present session with a new
melhod of attack. A bill introduced
by Mr. Sheppanl provides that each
person who receives the seeds shall
report the result of their planting
to the Department of Agriculture, and
that all these reports shall be pub
lished as a public document, for the
enlightenment anil eilificallon of the
American farmer. Should the bill be
come law. the capacity of the Govern
ment printing office will have to be
increased about a hundred fold, ami
new paper mills would have to be
erected right away.
The Keep Commission will get Mr.
Sheppard if ho don't look out.
WASHINGTON WANTS
INAUGURATION PAGEANT
Citizens of Washington are natur
ally much interested In the agitation
now raging to havo less display in
connection with the inauguration of
future presidents, and to have con
gress appropriate whatever money Is
necessary to cover the cost of these
simpler Inaugurations. They are very
willing hat congress should foot the
bills, if congress feels so disposed,
but they don't 'cotton" much to the
idea that there should be less dis
play at inauguration time.
Though it would have the world be.
lieve it blase and unstirred by the
strains of martial music, Washington
dearly loves the sight of marching
soldiers and all the pomp and circum
stances of militant, display. Tho cap
Hal would lie a dreary waste without
these quadrennial exhibitions.
