Nome Facts nbout Corrnption In Washing
ton Two Sides to (he Pictnre-frlll-
dsms or Grant's Administration. "
Correspondence Knoxvil'e Chronicle.
Washington. D. C. Dec. 2.
The city is rapidly filling up with Sena
tors, members of the House and the usual
throng of attendant visitors and lobbyists
1 he latter compose a numerous class, but
are not as respectable and mllucntial as
many suppose. It is a very common thing
for newspaper writers to magnify the ex
tern; or corruption In Washington in and
aoout congress ana the Departments.
There are many correspondents who make
this subject their stock in trade. They
would have little else to write about, for as
a class tne men who constantlv write on
that subject have not brains enough to find
otner material of which to make interest
ing letters. YY hen I say this, I do not
want to be understood either as saying
that there is no corruption here, or that
newspaper correspondents do not often
have just foundation for their complaints
On the contrary, every shrewd observing
visitor in ashington will see some dis
honesty and sellishness on the part of
public men,, and realize also, that the
newspaper -correspondents at Wash
ington, as a class, are an able, fearless
aud valuable corps of gentlemen; who
reuder the public a great service in
closely watching and exposing all jobs
and the nianv selfish and dishonorable
motives that govern some , men in the
public service. But unfortunately there
belongs to this corps a few who are chronic
grumblers and men of narrow views and
extreme prejudices. They see many tin
worthy and incompetent men in office
They see mean motives and corrupt inllu
ences governing them in their acts. They
straightway suspect every one, and where
there is the least ground for suspicion,
jump at the worst conclusions. They are
encouraged to do this, for their letters ana
dispatches burdened with' these tales of
malfeasance in office, and with many sus
picious and irrave charces. are eacrerlv
read by thousands of persons who are al
ways ready to believe everything of their
kind that is bad. buch readers call cor
respondents of this kind "spicy" and "in
corruptible." 'lhe Democratic papers very
Maturely give undue prominence to such
"honest truths" (as they call, them) and
tickle the writers and their papers by com
mending them as "independent," &c.
Such influences act very freely upon some
men. and always serve to keep hard at
work some dyspeptic soreheads.who write
many unjust and unfounded stories about
public men in Washington and elsewhere.
But, as I said before, there is some corrup
tion here as. there is in every place
where public monies are dispensed, and
there always has been and always will be;
It is very natural that dishonest men flock
where the plunder is to be found.
THE OTHER SIDE OK THE FICTUKE.
But there is another side of the picture
encouraging to every man that suspects in
tegrity and ability in public servants.
There are men in high position here and I
am clad to believe them largely in the ma
jority who maintain their integrity against
" a i.i! nM i.
every lempiaiiou. x uk-u iciupuiwuns are
great. Men of moderate means come to
Washington with their families. They find

many unexpecteu aemauus upon ineir
(urse. i neir wives auu uaugiuers imug
ing in the social circle want fine dresses
and costly jewels, They are invited to en
tertainments, and, or course, w,ant to re
ciprocate. In these and other ways their
salaries soon melt away. The conflict be
tween ambition and pride and their sense
of duty begins. Temptations are placed
before them by cunning nvais or personal
. i ;ii i
enemies or oeterniinea men wun ueavy
iobs and glgantw swindling enterprises.
Thev see where they might mate a. thou
sand or ten thousand and not be discover
ed. Some yield, but many resist and fight
manfully through, spurning dishonorable
advances and exposing dangerous com
binations. There are many men mpubhe life

struggles in this respect present sublime
pictures of WtfraJ hefoism. I could name
able and incorruptifcte ran who have
stood up like heroes and fought eprtuptiMn
in every form for years, and all through
their public life had nothing but their
salary ta support them and their families.
They are, lani glad to say, the men of in
fluence and character Lercjt.Q-day and their
word is worth more to defeat corruptions
than powerful lobbies are to press them
through, f
The example an4 inuuence of one such
man is worth more to promote integrity
and fidelity in the service of the govern
ment than the example of those whose
dishonorable acts are being exposed aud
punished every day. It seems to me that
the public want to know something of this
side of the picture, and they would hear
and see more of it, if, by their actions,
they gave these grumblers to understand
that their constant prating about corrup
tion was rather suspicion a d certainly
not acceptable, unless based upon reliable
information or reasonable proof. I might
mention some correspondents here who
have attained considerable reputation. I
ought, perhaps, to say notoriety, because
of their constant lamentations on the de
moralization of tJ;fi public service, who
were, at the very time, afeticg as the hired
tools of lobbyists. These tools, accusing
public men here of all sorts of personal
vice?, were themselves victims of the very
same abuses, and, in fact, otten based their
suspicions upon their own experiences. It
is very easy to find fault and criticize, and
some very naturally run into that rut.
They see the weak points of public men,
but sbut their eyes to the strong points.
They see corruption, buf turn away from
shining examples of integrity. They look
after subservient, weak men, but pass
bv tvvirips independent ones. They gee
reasons for suspecting wrong, but they do
nnt wnit, in pive their victim tne Denem
of the doubt. Thev seem never t5 think
i ney secnr ne
easier to destroy reputations
them up ; that it is pleasant-
that it is far
than to build
er to throw etonpa than to be struck with
them, - --, - f, i v"v
But it is useless t to follow the subj ect
farther. The whole matter can be summed
up by saying that if half the stories and
suspicious of corruption in Washington
were true, we would not long have a Gov
ernment. If laws were enacted without
regard for ther Constitution, or if they
were executed without reference ! to. the
public service; if legislators in providing
for the public expenditures or administra
tion officers in disbursing the public mon
ies were influenced as -much by corrupt
agencies as some men charge, and as many
profess to believe, wo would Ik? so steeped

atlection that the whole fabric of Govern
nient would fall to pieces, r '
HIE FHESENT ADMINISTRATION IS AN
EXAMPLE.
It is just now fashionable to sneer at the
present Administration as corrupt and
without any head. As far as corruption
is concerned, I have perhaps answered it
above, but may add that that though the
amount , of patronage, and consequently
uie inuueements to dishonesty are yearly
increasing, there is a more determined war
being waged to day against1 corruption,;
uhu m iaci mere is comparatively less dis
honesty in AVashington to-day than for
many administrations. "
As to the charge that there is no head to
the present Administration, it may best be
answered by saying that a criticism, very
onen maue Dy us inenos, is that there is
too much of it. Montgomery Blair, in his
A A ? a i -a
recem interview, saui ijranr, naa never
read a book, had but little general infor
mation; and knew nothing of his duties.
And yet, as a fact, Uen. Grant has written
more of his own State papers, which com
pare favorably with others, and taken less
advice as to the policy of his administra
tion, than any President we have had for
years. I was assured of this fact bv a gen
tleman in high position here, who has had,
to a remarkable extent, the conhdence of
several preceding Administrations. 'He
told me that, but a few days ago, he visited
the President in his private room and saw
his forthcoming message just being com
pleted, every word of it written by the
President himself, "and," he added'there
was not a man, then living, who knew its
contents." The San Domingo message
accompanying the Commissioners' report,
which was most favorably received every
where, was every line of it the President's
work, and without any consultation. It
is very customary for such State docu
ments to be written by Cabinet officers, a ad
very uncommon for them to be prepared
without full consultation with the Cabinet
and other confidential ad vi vers. It ought
to be so, and. therefore, I say the criticism
that the Administration had too much
head " is not. uncommon. . I mention
these facts to 6how howfalso is the general
charge, that the President knows nothing
about his duties, and never wrote (and, as
a fact, could not write) his State papers.
A. J. It.
, The Trcsidcut's Message. .
We give the following extracts from the
President's Message, as we find it iu our
exchanges :
OUR FOREIGN RELATIONS.
The relations of the United State with
foreign powers continue to be friendly.
The year has been an eventful one, in wit
nessing two great nations, speaKing one
language and having one lineage, settling,
by peaceful arbitrations, disputes of long
standing, and liable, at any time, to bring
inose nations inio oioouy connicts. ivn
example has thus been set which, if suc
cessful in its final issue, may be followed
by other civilized nations, and be the final
means of returning to productive industry
millions of men now maintained to settle
the disputes of nations by the bayonet and
broadsword. 1 transmit nerewitna copy
of the treaty alluded to, which has been
concluded since the adjournment , of Con
erress. with her Britannic Majesty, and a
conv of the protocol of the conferences of
tne jonimissioiiers uy wnuiu it was iiugu-
7. 'V. , ' i i :t
tiated. This treaty provides methods tor
g thp mjestiona pending between
nations; fThe various 'questions
are to be adjusted by arbitrations.
THE NATIONAL DEBT
has been reduced to the extent of eighty
six millions fifty-seven thousand one hun
dred and twenty-six dollars aud eighty
cents during the year, and by the negotia-
tion of national conas at a lower raie oi
. l , xw t i i x e
interest, the iuterest on' the public debt
has been so far diminished that now the
sum to be raised for the interest account is
nearly seventeen million dollars less than
on the first of -March, 1S69. Itwas highly
desirable that this rapid dimunition should
take
place, both to strengthen the credit
of the country, and convince its citizens
of their ehtytie ifoWl P mPP Yen dllar
of liability without bankrupting them.
But in view of the accomplishment of
these desirable ends and of the rapid de
velopment of the resources of the country,
its increasing, ability to meet ..large de
mands and the amount already paid, it is
not desirable that the present resources of
the country should continue to be taxed
in order to continue this - rapid payment.
T therefore recommend a modification of
both . '
TAUlFJf" AND IHTSRNAL TAX LAWJa.
. I would recommend that all taxes from
internal sources be abolished, except those
on spirituous, vinous and malt liquors,
and tobacco in its various forms from
stamps. In readjusting tne inrm l suggest;
that a careful estimate be made of the
amount of surplus revenue collected under
the pjeient . laws, ntter providing ior tne
current expenses of tue government, tne
interest account and a sinking fund, and
that this as a surplus be reduced in such
manner as to afford the greatest relief to
the greatest number. There are. many
articles not produced at home, such as
medicines and compounded essences,
from hfch ypry little revenue is derived,
but which enter into general u&e, .u
such articles I recommend to be placed on
the free list. Should a further reduction
prove advisable, I would then recommend
that it be made on those articles which it
rn without disturbing home production
or reducing'.the v&ges cf American labor.
I have not entered into figures, Deeause io
do so would be to repeal an tnac is iaia

' TUE KUKLUX LAW.
There has been imnosed upon the Exe
cutive branch of the Government the exe
cution of the act of Congress, approved
April 20th, 1871, and commonly known as
the Kuklux law. In a portion of the State
of South Carolina the necessity, oi tne
course pursued will be demonstrated by
the report of the committee to investigate
Southern outrages. Under the provisions
of the above act I issued a proclamation
calling the attention of the people of the
United States to the . same and declaring
my reluctance to exercise any of the ex
traordinary powers thereby conferred upon
me except in case of imperative necessity,
by making known my purpose to exercise
such powers whenever it should become
necessary to do so for the purpose of se
curing to all citizens of the United States
the Peaceful enjoyment of the rights guar
ranteed to them oy the Constitution and
the laws. After the passage of this law in
formation was received from time to time
that a combination of the character re
ferred to in this law existed and were pow
erful in many parts of the Southern States,
particularly in certain counties in the
State of South Carolina.
A careful investigation was made, and it
was ascertained that In nine counties
that State such combinations -were active
and powerful, embracing a sufficient por
tion of the citizens to control the local au
thorities, and having, among other things.
the object of depriving the emancipated
class of the substantial benefits of freedom,
and preventing the free political action of
those citizens who did not sympathize with
their own views. Among their operations
were frequent scourgings and occasional
assassinations generally perpetrated at
night by disguised persons, the victims in
almost all cases being citizens of different
political sentiments from their own, or
free persons who had shown a disposition
to claim equal rights with other citizens.
Thousands of inoffensive ' and well dis
posed citizens were the sufferers by this
lawless violence. Thereupon, on the 13th
oi uctooer, ii, a proclamation was is
sued, In terras of the law, calling upon the
members of the combinations to disperse
within live aays, ana to deliver to the mar
shal or military officer of the United States
all arms, ammunition, uniforms, disguists
and other means and implements used by
tnem ior carrying out their unlawful pur
poses, mis warning not 'having been
heeded, on the I7th of October another
proclamation was issued suspending the
privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in
nine counties in that State.
Direction was given that within the
counties ho designated persons supposed,
upon creditable information, to be mem
bers of such unlawful combinations should
be arrested by the military forces of the
United States and delivered to the Marshal,
to be dealt with according to law. In two
of said counties York and Spartanburg
many arrests have been made. At last
a'irtuuu th number of person thus nr.
rested were one iiuuuiru auu oiAt -vi6uv.
Several hundred, whose criminality was
ascertained to be of an inferior degree.
were released for the present. These have
generally made confessions of their guilt.'
Great caution has been exercised in mak
ing test arrests, and, notwithstanding the
largo uqinbpr, if is believed that no inno
cent person is now in custody. The prison
ers will be held for regular trial in the ju
dicial tribunals of the United States.
As soon as it appeared that the authori
ties of the United States were about to
take vigorous measures to enforce the law.
many persons absconded, and there is good
ground for supposing that all such persons
have vjolatea te Jaw. A uu report of
what has been done under this law will be
submitted to Congress by the Attorney
General.
POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
More than six years having elapsed
since the last hostile gun was hred be
tween the armies then arrayed against
each other one for the perpetuation, and
the other for the destruction of the Union,
it may be well considered whether it is
not time that the disabilities imposed by
the Fourteenth Amendment should le re
moved : that the amendment does not ex
clude the ballot, but only requires the disa
bility to hold office of certain classes,
when the purity of the ballot and secure
majorities are sure to elect officers reflect
ing the views of the majority. I do not
see th.e advantage or propriety of exclud
ing inen from otfioe merely. They were,
before the rebellion, men or standing and
character sufficient to be elected to posi
tions requiring them to take an oath to
support the Constitution, and admitting
to eligibility those entertaining the same
views, but of lsss standing in their com
munities. It may be said the former vio
lated an oath, while the latter did not,
Tho latter did not have it in their power tQ
do so. If they had taken ihis oath it cant
not be doubted they would have broken it
as did the former class. If there are any
greater criminals distinguished above all
others for the part they took in opposition
to the Government, they might, in the
judgment of Congress be excluded from
such an amnesty. This subjecp is
nutted 'for your careful consideration.
The condition of the Southern States
are, unhappily, not such as all true, patri
otic citizens would like to sec. Social os
tracism for opinion's sake, personal vio
lence or threats towards persons entertain
ing political views opposed to those enter
tained by the majqnty of tha old citizens,
prevents immigration and tho fiow of
mucn lieeueu capital into uie owes laieiy
in rebellion. Jt will be a happy condition
of the country when the old citizens of
these States will take an interest in public
affairs and promulgate ideas honestly en
tertained, vote for men representing their
views and permit the same freedom of ex
pression and ballot in those entertaining
different political convictions.
. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
luniv message to t'onurtss one year ago.
J urgently reborn meuded .v reform, in the
civil' service of the country : in conformity
with that recommendation. Congress, in
the 9th section of an act making appro
priations fur tiUUdiy clTil expenses of the
government, and for other purposes, .ap
proved March 3d, 1871, gave the necessa
ry authority to the Executive to inaugu
rate a civil service reform, and placed upon
the responsibility of doing so under the au
thority of said law. I convened a board f
erentlemen eminentlv oualified for the
work, to uevlse rules and regulations toei-
- . . . - . ... .
feet the needed reform. Their labors are
not yet complete, but it is believed that
thev will succeed in devising apian which
can be adapted to the great relief of the
Executive, the heads of departments and
members of Congress, and which will re
dound to the truejinterest of the public
service. At all events, the experiment
shall have a fair trial.
