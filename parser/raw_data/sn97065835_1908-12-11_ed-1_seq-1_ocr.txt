E. W.MARTIN
SWORN IN
TOOK OATH OF OFFICE AS CON­
GRESSMAN, SUCCEEDING LATE
CONGRESSMAN PAltKER.
AFTER SHORT SESSIONS, SEN­
ATE AND H(1 JSE ADJOURNED
RESPECTING DECEASED.
Washington, Dec. 7.—After being
in session an hour, half of which
time was consumed in roll call, the
house of representatives, which met
at noon today, adjourned out of re
spect for the memory of several of
its members and Senator Allison, of
Iowa, all of whom died during the
recess.
Seven new members were sworn
in to fill vacancies caused by death
or resignation. Among those who
received the oath of office was Eben
W. Martin, of South Dakota. The
Martin resolutions were adopted ex
pressing the regret of the house at
the deaths of various members, Con
gressman Parker, of South Dakota,
included'.
The most important action was
the passage by unanimous consent
a resolution authorizing the commit
tee on ways and means in its tariff
bearings to subpoena witnesses and
call for books and papers. A num
ber of bills of public interest were
introduced.
The roll call showed the pres
ence of 651 members.
Washington,Dec. 7.—There was a
pall of sadness over the United
States senate when it convened to
day, which was due to the absence
of- the late Senator William B. Alli
son, of Iowa, who died last August.
Senator Dolliver announced the
death of the late Senator Allison
and resolutions expressing the pro
found sorrow of the senate over this
bereavement were adopted. As a
further mark of respect for his mem
ory the senate, after a session last
ing fifteen minutes, adjourned for
the day.
The roll call showed 82 members
present.
A thorny path coinfronts the pos
tal savings bank bill in spite of the
fact that its passage was advocated
•by the republican national platform.
When Senator Carter secured a spec
ial order to take up this measure
on Dec. 14th, it is said he had
pledged sufficient votes to pass the
bill in the senate but the situation
seems changed and at present it is
doubtful whether Carter can rally
any where near the required num
ber. If Carter can bring the bill
to a vote, the chance of its passage
is considered small.
Washington, Dec. 7.—The demo
crats of the ho.use are planning to
demand an investigation of the pur
chase of the Panama canal property
and in conformity with this program
Representative Rainey, of Illinois,
today introduced a resolution direct
ing the speaker to appoint a com
mittee of five to 'ascertain how
much of the $40,000,000 which ap
pears on record has been paid to
•the French canal company was really
paid that company." It is said that
the national democratic committee
asked Rainey to present the resolu
tion, which provides that the com
mittee shall ascertain whether any
portion of the $40,000,000 was di
rectly or indirectly paid American
citizens or to an American syndi
cate and also if any member of the
senate or the house profited by the
transaction.
BANK ROBBERY AT PORTLAND.
Bandits Secured $1(5,500 From Bai.k
in Heart of the City.
Portland, Ore., Dec. 7.—The East
Side bank, located at East Wash
ington street and Grand avenue,
was robbed at six o'clock this even
ing by three men and it is under
stood that they secured about $1C,
500. President Newhall and his scr,

ness when two armed men with re
volvers entered. Newhall and it
son. were commanded to throw up
their hands and while thus covered
with revolvers one man crawled
through the receiving teller's cagc,
passed out the money and crawled
back into the foyer.
The three men made their escape
before the alarm could be sounded.

Attorney W. G. Porter for the
Milwaukee railroad will be in Chi
cago tomorrow. His representation
of the Milwaukee is a representa
tion of seven roads, all of whom
have brought cases. By tacit agree
ment, the Milwaukee case is prose
cuted as a test case.
Attorney P. W. Dougherty, of Dell
Rapids, for the railway commission,
will take part in the hearing before
J. Howard Gates, appointed special
master by Judge Carland. Mr.
Gates has already left for Chicago.
William Wallace, of Aberdeen, also
goes to Chicago as stenographer to
take the testimony.
The roads represented by the Mil
waukee, which is the largest mileage
owner in the state, are the Chicago,
Burlington & Quincy, the Rock Is
land, the Minneapolis & St. Louis,
the Northwestern, the Pierre, Rapid
City & Northwestern, and the White
River Valley. Cases have been filed
by all these roads, and temporary
injunctions against the commission's
order have been granted.
The cases were taken into federal
court directly, without remedy in the
state courts, because, it is stated, by
the railroad attorneys, they involved
valuation of over $2,000, and im
plicated diversity of residence.
There is no provision In the state
statutes giving the railroads relief
in the state courts, and there will
probably be no action taken in this
regard until after the decision in
federal court, as to whether the
commission's order of the 2 cent
rate can be regarded as confiscation
of property, and in violation of the
fourteenth amendment.
THE BROWNSVILLE HEARING.
Case Will Be Threshed Out Before
the Supreme Court.
Washington, Dec. 8.—The bloody
affray at Brownville, Texas, which
resulted by the discharge from the
irmy, by President Roosevelt, of the
iegro troops alleged to have been
implicated will come up for hearing
igalh today before the United States
Supreme court. At today's hearing
the members of the supreme bench
will listen to arguments in the case
of the former negro soldier, Oscar
Reid, who was dismissed from the
service without honor on account of
his alleged implication in the Brown
Wile affair.
The suit was instituted by Reid
in the United States Circuit Court
for Southern New York for pay dur
ing the time of his enlistment. The
verdict of that court was against him
and he brought an appeal to the
supreme court on the ground that
the President had exceeded his con
stitutional power in dismissing the
three companies without a trial by
sourt martial.
In the case of negro soldiers who
have applied for re-enlistment in the
army, measures to permit such ac
tion will 'probably be considered by
Congress. One of these applications
is from Sergeant Mingo -Sanders, a
member of the discharged batallion
if the twenty-fifth infantry, who has
had thirty years service in the army.
It is understood the president dis
approved the application on the gen
oral ground that the negro has not
produced sufficient or satisfactory
•roof of his innocence, and that hav
'ng failed to do so within three
months of his discharge, the statute
governing such cases restrains the
^resident from acting. He takes the
ground that bills now pending be
fore the senate propose giving him
authority to reenlist soldiers of the
twenty-fifth regiment, and some
measure will probably.be enacted at
the next session of congress.
NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC RALLY.
Lenders are Looking Ahead to the
Next Campaign.
Washington, December 8.— To
consider plans for insuring party
success in 1912, prominent demo
crats from many states are gather
ing in Washington today to take part
in a session of the National Demo
'-•ratic League.
Chairman William C. Liller de
clares that a meeting has not been
'"ailed in the interest of Bryan or any
'ther possible candidate. He explain
ed that it is the purpose of the league
to maintain intact the organization
now existing and to strengthen
M-'iigue so as to eliminate the work of
reorganization at the beginning of
ach campaign.
"The democratic party, while dis
nyipointed over the result of the elec
tion, has much cause for elation
said Colonel Liller. 'The party is
now united more thoroughly than at
any time since 1892. Its recent de
feat has not dampened the enthusi
asm of its members, but awakened
them to the necessity of proper or
ganization and a return to true and
fundamental democratic principles.
The organization of clubs will be
pushed everywhere from now on."
Leading democratic clubs all over
the country have sent representatives
to the rally. The sessions will oc
cupy tomorrow and Thursday.

EVIDENCE IN FEDERAL SUIT DIS­
CLOSED TREMENDOUS PROF­
ITS IN MIDDLE STATES.
PRICE CUTTING TO UNDERSELL
COMPETITORS DENIED BY
STANDARD OFFICIALS.
New York, Dec. 7.—Figures show
ing some of the profits of the Stand
ard Oil Co., became a part of the
records of the federal suit to dis
solve the Standard Oil Co., of New
Jersey, when John D. Archibald re
sumed the stand for a brief exami
nation and Tilford, president of the
Standard Oil Co., of California testi
fied at some length for the defense.
The figures submitted showed that
in the middle west a profit of 115
per cent had been made on a capi
tal of $300,000 and that the Stand
ard Oil Co., of Indiana, on a capi
talization of $1,000,000 had earned
about $55,000,000 between 1899
and 1906.
The counsel for the government
tried to prove by Tilford that in
California and other western states
the Sandard made contracts with
its competitors whereby it obtained
all the crude oil supply. Referring
to oil trade cutting in Colorado and
elsewhere, Tilford sand that the
Standard never cut prices to under
-iMl its competitors, but lowered the
:ates to meet the reductions of its
rivals.

GOVERNORS IN THE CAPITOL.
Conservation Conference Now Get
ting Down to Work.
Washington, Dec. 8.—With Presi
dent-elect Taft as presiding officer,
and President Roosevelt on the pro
gram f6r the principal address, the
joint meeting opened today by the
National Conservation Commission
and the governors of states and their
official representatives promises to
be one of the most noteworthy
gatherings of its kind in the history
of the country. Chief executives of
many of the most populous states
of the union are in attendance and
these, added to the long list of prom
inent scientists and others who are
to appear, will make the gathering
nearly as important as the White
House conference, which began the
work. The Conservation Commis
sion, appointed by Mr. Roosevelt,,
serves without pay, and great pres
sure will be brought to bear on
Congress to obtain an appropriation
for the work to be done.
The Southern Commercial Con
gress, which opened yesterday, con
tinued its deliberations today. The
National Rivers and Harbor Con
gress will meet tomorrow, and on
Thursday Secretary Strauss will
(coitye^ie t(he National Council of
Commerce. Today's session of the
Governors and the National Conser
vation Commission, and the subse
quent Rivers and Harbors Congress,
will mark the taking of a great
stride forward in the movement for
taking account of the natural re
sources of the United States. The
inventory undertaken by the com
mission is now ready and the re
port to the President is in process
of completion.
When the conservation movement
was started specific information
about the actual state of our re
sources was partly wanting, partly
inaccessible. Certain facts were
broadly known. It was at least un
questionable that resources had been
wastefully used, and that some of
them, notably the mines, were sure
in time to be exhausted, while
others, for example the forests,
'Ould still be kept perpetually by
light management. The first work
was to get the facts, to show exactly
what the situation was and how it
could be improved by measures that
would work. Without an inven
tory which should show the present
condition of the resources and the
way to develop them to the best ad
vantage, conservation was in danger
of staying up in the air.
This inventory has now been taken
and nothing remains but the in
auguration of practical reform meas
ures to which such an inventory
points the way. Conservation of the
waterways of the nation is one of
the most important phases of the
work undertaken, and this will be
brought to the front by the conven
tion to be opened tomorrow by the
National Rivers and Harbors Con
gress. Hundreds of delegates are
already here, representing all cf,
the important river improvement
societies of the country, and it is ex
pected that the total number will
reach 2,500.
Interest in this great movement
is growing constantly for this con-
^C*_hiua
and WESTEBU STOCE BSVIET77".
gress represents no particular section
or project, but is the direct repre
sentative of all sections that have
meritorious claim for the improve
ment of a river or a lake, a harbor
or a canal. This national organiza
tion—with delegates from every
part of the Union—stands for a
policy, broad, liberal and compre
hensive policy for the improvement
by the federal government of all
waterways that have been examined
and favorably reported upon by the
engineer officers of the army and by
them recommended to the congress
of the United Slates as worthy of
improvement for the benefit of the
commerce of tire nation.
It is estimated that the total
amount of the freight charges saved
by our waters last year in their pres
ent bad condition—many of them be
ing incapable of profitable use—was
$94 5,000,000. And if this amount
is saved every year with our rivers,
coastal waters and harbors in their
present deplorable condition, it is
fair to assume that when they are
all well improved with connecting
canals between them where needed,
the saving will be infinitely greater.

CRAZY MAN RUN AMUCK.
Hiram Badjjer Killed His Two
Daughters and Shot Up the Town.
Wakefield, Mass., Dec. 8.—Grow

today killed his two haughters,
Florence, aged 15, and Catherine,
aged 7, and then ran amuck through
the streets of the town shooting at
people he met and into store win
dows. A grocery clerk received a
bullet in his leg. Badger was fin

The officers are of the opinion
that Badger's madness was due pri

Farmers and DroVers National bank,
which failed in this place several
years ago for over two million dol
lors, began here today. Owing to
allegations that political influence
had been responsible for the long
delay in the case and the recent
special investigations ordered by
President Roosevelt, which resulted
in a date being set next month in
the United States court, at Pitts

be a sensaional legal battle in the

IX BUSINESS SECTION OF
KANSAS CITY.
FOLLOWED EFFORT OF PROBA­
TION OFFICER TO CARE
FOR CHILDREN.
Kansas City, Dec. S.-—In the very
shadow of the city ball and within
less than a half mile from the busi
ness center of this city, a riot, in
which religious fanatics and the po
lice were participants and in which
over a hundred shots were fired,
this afternoon resulted in the death
of one policeman and a girl thirteen
years old, fatally injuring three per
sons and slightly injuring two other
persons. The trouble took place
when the streets were crowded with
people and while the battle was in
progress the participants traversed
an entire block, the final stages be
ing enacted directly across the
street from the police station.
George M. Hall, probation officer,
went to Fourth and Newman streets
to investigate a case of alleged ab
duction and when he was near that
corner he came upon a man named
Sharp, who was surrounded by com
panions and was exhorting a crowd
of street loafers. With Sharp were
a man, woman and five children,
the latter ranging in age from three
to fourteen years. The officer's sus
picions were aroused by the manner
in which the woman attempted to
secure money contributed by the
crowd and lie decided that she and
her male companion were not proper
persons to have the custody of young
children. He accosted the woman
and received a sharp reply.
Hall was not armed and found
himself at a decided disadvantage
when Sharp and his companions
showed revolvers but he stood his
ground and received an ugly blow
behind the right oar. Hall started
for the police station to secure the
aid and the police sargeant ordered
two patrolmen to arrest Sharp and
his followers. The party was with
in fifty yards of the police station
when the officers stepped into the
-street. The officers were not pre
pared for the volley of bullets
which met them as they appeared
upon the scene and one officer was
instantly killed, while the other offi
cer received a bullet in his arm.
Another officer rushed into the
street and a general battle ensued
but the officer was unable to shoot
without endangering the lives of
innocent persons. When the fight
ing ceased Sharp lay fattally wound
ed and the woman and children had
escaped to a boat on the river.
The police followed the fleeing
woman and children and the woman
resisted them with a shot gun when
hto officers rushed the boat. The
woman dropped the weapon and at
tempted to escape by rowing across
the river. She refused to stop when
ordered to do so by the officers and,
upon her refusal to stop the police
fired a volley. One shot struck the
girl in the face and she died later
in the hospital. After the girl was
wounded the woman surrendered.
She claimed to be the mother of the
children.
IIO.MKSTAKK GAINING DEPTH.
Only
Two Out of Six Shafts Loss
Than 1,000 Feet Deep.
Lead, S. D., Dec. 8.—Sunday the
north cage in the Star shaft began
making trips to the 1,250-foot level
and at the same time work of re
moving the bulk-heads in the Elli
son, below the 1,550 level, was un
dertaken. These bulkheads were
placed below that level for the sake
of safety, while the miners were en
gaged in sinking the shaft below.
It is expected that by tomorrow,
or within a few days at the latest,
the big cagc at the Ellison will be
lropping to the 1,700-foot level,
which is the greatest depth yet at
tained in the great mine. A station
has been cut at the 1,700 level and
two drifts run a distance of approx
imately 100 feet each. Both of these
is said, cross cut the ore body
and it would not be surprising if
ore was hoisted from the 1,700 with
in a few fceeks.
It is rumored that the Ellison will
be sunk to the 1,850 level, the work
to be taken up soon. This would not
be surprising, as for the past several
years the winter months have been
utilized for sinking in the several
shafts of the company.
The big cage dropping to the 1,700
will do away with the use of the
little "donkey" engine which has
been utilized to raise and lower the
men and hoist dirt from the lowest
level. This little engine was placed
on the 1,550. It will probably be
taken to the 1,700 and again used in
sinking. It was only a few years
ago that the Star shaft at a depth of
1,100 feet was the deepest, not only
of the Homestako company, but in
the Black Hills, and many good min
ers believed then that the Home
stake had reached its lowest depth,
but exploration proved that the ore
body is as large here if not larger
than on any of the levels above and

other shafts were put down to this

The action is entitled "The United
States of America vs. C. O. Bailey,
•eceiver of the Missouri River &
Northwestern Ralrway company, a
corporation," and is brought by
United States District Attorney E.
Wagner, at the instigation of the
'ederal attorney general.
The case mentions the present
•oreclosure proceedings in the sev
enth judicial circuit in Pennington
•ounty, stating that the road is un
ler action foreclosing certain bonds.
That Clarence D. Crouch, Vern E.
rouch, and C. O. Bailey, were re
ceivers for the bankrupt road to
May 19, 1908, when C. O. Bailey
alone was appointed to act as re
ceiver, is stated. It was on C. O.
Bailey, of Sioux Falls, the summons
as served in the federal court case.
The road is extended and operated'
nly within the Pennington county
limits.
That the carelessness of the In
solvent road on April 20, 1908, was
•esponsible for the burning of 1,000
acres of Uncle Sam's choicest pine
timber in the Black Hills forest re
serve, is charged. It is stated the
company allowed dry grass and
oilier combustible and inflammable
material to collect on the right of
way, and that escaping sparks from
locomotive set the lire which de
stroyed choice timber to Uncle Sam's
damage in the sum of $6,175.
The federal Indictment charges
that a claim was made on C: O.
Bailey for the amount of the dam
age, claiming carelessness on the
part of the road officials In allowing
the dry grass on the right of way
and in not providing proper "spark
preventers" for the locomotive.
That this claim of the government
over the other creditors of the bank
rupt road be preferred over other
claims is another demand in the
judgment asked, because the action
Is brought on damage inside the time
of insolvency of the road, and is
considered a running expense under
the bankruptcy proceeding.
It is claimed by the attorneys that
the claim is asked' preferred under
the statutes, as the damaging fire
occurred since the road had been de
clared bankrupt. Interest on the
$6,175 is also asked, from April 20,
1908.
