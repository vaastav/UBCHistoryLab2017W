Secretary of Treasury Asks
For More Stringent Laws
on tiie Subject.
WANTS NEW LAW
FOE THE BANKS
Washington, P. C, Dec. 18. More
stringent laws to prevent tve smug
gling of opium Into Ut4 United States
along its borders Is urged by the secre
tary of the treasury In his annual re
port, made to congress today. He also
sajs the government is rigidly Inves
tigating treasury frauds and suggests
the revision of tariffs In a scientific
manner to do away with much of the
court interpretation now necessary. He
aiso wants the law amended so that
returning tourists will have more lib
erty in the classes of articles they may
elect to include under the $16 worth
n inch the tariff exempts from duty for
all returning Americans. All of these
are questions of much interest along
the border nnd at Kl Paso.
Of the oiuum matter, the secretary
sas.
Opium Smuggling.
"The present laws prohibiting the
importation of smoking opium into this
country and all our laws relating to
opium are working very badly. The
smuggling of opium is a wide-spread
and a most serious offence The Intent
and policy of the government's reform
are practical! defeated. Meanwhile,
the attempted enforcement of the law
requires the great vigilance and con
stant activities of the treasury depart
ment without the hope of anything be-
ond the most incomplete success. Our
entire borders are used for this perni
cious and degrading smuggling, with
the effect of largely defeating the gov-
rnment's settled purpose to stamp out
'he opium vice. Proposed laws are be
fore congress bearing upon this im
portant moral and administrative situ
ation, and impelled by the sense of the
seriousness of this situation, created
b the practical experience of the
t-easury department during the past
ear, I have the honor to beg for them
toe determined attention of tne con
gress "
Rehabilitating Customs Service.
Of the customs service the secretary
sa s
The work of investigating, correct
ing and rehabilitating the 'Customs

tinuous progress since the date of my

and frauds upon the revenues continoe:

reform is not yet in sight.
d Valorem and Specific Duties.
' The experience of the treasury de
partment in administering the tariff
lis brings to all who share this ex
ner ence lhe most positive conviction
ihat tariff legislation should adopt the
policy of establishing specific duties in
stead of ad -valorem duties wherever the
nature of the article involved makes
that a possihllit. The practice of
adopting ad valorem duties adds to the
-ae and quickness with which legisla
tion may be prepared: but that is its
nnh helpful quality and that lonely
uualtt.i has its palpable drawbacks. Ad
valorem duties lead directly to the
great majority of all the frauds
SdearlHe Tariff LegMatien.
"The present session of congress is
expected to consider and revise some
'f the schedules of the tariff law; and
it is a matter of great concern to the
treasury department, as the department
w hich has to administer the tariff laws.
that entirely apart from the question
f the rates of dufes, the revision shall
I'p made with scientific knowledge and
accuracy. . The importance of these
( onsiderations is not confined to the
adoption of specific rates' of duty in
stead of ad valorem rates, but includes
the intricate questions of classification.
And in addition to all the rest it in
cludes a far more scientific statement
of the purposes of congress in the terms
and language used.
"The old methods of tariff legislation
hae thrown upon the treasury depart
ment and the courts an Immense, in
terminable and perpetual amount of in
terpretation of a law ifhich ought to
be so plain as to scarcely need auy in
terpretation at all. And when the scien
tific method and spirit of legislating
on the tariff is reduced to a practice
and this scientific practice includes all
the features of the tariff law which
affect its ready interpretation, a large
and expensive element of the daily

Bxemptfen far Tourists.
"Much personal annoyance to citi
zens returning from abroad and much
unremuneratlve work upon the part of
customs officers and employes would
be saved if the exacting and narrow
provisions of the tariff law with re
gard to the articles which may be in
cluded in the small exemption from
duty upon articles to the value of $100,
allowed returning residents, were
changed.
Pa-agraph 709 of the tariff act has
been construed by the courts as limit
ing the articles which may be included
within such exemption, to such as con
stitute wearing apparel, toilet articles,
articles of personal adornment and
similar personal effects, which are
necessary' and appropriate for the wear
and use of the traveler and not in

"The last clause of paragraph 709
could be changed by striking out

Eeyistas Claim It Is Manu
factured Story to Get Sym
pathy For President.'
TWO GENEEALS
UNDEE AEEEST
Mexico City. Mexico, Dec. IS. Sup
porters of Gen. Bernardo Reyes declare
that the alleged conspiracy to, murder
president Madero and establish Gen.
Reyes as provisional president under
a military rule, was cooked up by sup
porters of Madero to excite sympathy
for the president, detract from his in
ability to restore peace to the country,
put him in position to execute his op
ponents and give him a charge suf
ficiently strong to warrant the execu
tion of Reyes if captured in Mexico,
or for ths extradition of the general
if he is arrested again in the United
States. The Reylstas point to the con
stitutional requirement that the vice
president would succeed the president
in event of the assassination of Ma
dero and cite this as proof that even
if Madero were killed It could not re
sult in Reyes gaining the presidency
any easier than he could do it now.
However, government officials claim
to have ample evidence to prove that
a conspiracy to assassinate president
Madero and proclaim a provisional pres
ident, pending the coming of Gen.
Reyes to the capital to assume to the
office of president, was frustrated at
the last moment. The authorities have
arrested Gen. Higinio Aguilar and Mi
llion Hurtado, of the federal army, and
a score of co-conspirators
The plan said to have been disclosed
bv correspondence and documents
found in the possession of prisoners,
was complete in details. Madero was
to have been shot from a balcony of the
Reforma hotel, in Avenida de la Re
forma. as he rode from Chapultepec this
morning. During the confusion which
this would create, the conspirators, who
called themselves the "Independent
Constitutional" army, were to swoop
down upon the national palace, kill
or seise the ministers and take posses
sion in the name of Reyes.
Upon assumption of power by Reyes
all Maderistas and Cientiflcos. it is as
serted, were to be eliminated from tne
government and their property confis
cated, together with that of all of the
wealthy class not in sympathy with
the movement.
Hurtado. said to have been slated for
the provisional vice presidency, was
at one time chief of police under presi
dent Diaz. i
Plantations Raided.
Mounted bandits, numbering 200. ac
cording to their victims, 'but. as usual,
reduced to 18 by statements of the
department of gobernaclon. yesterday
looted the haciendas of Moral and
Guadalupe, in the district of Chalco,
state of Mexico. The scene of their
operations extended from a point 15
miles from this city to 1 Moral, about
25 miles out.
The hacienda "El Moral, a depart
ment of the larger property known as
the hacienda de Miraflores, was at
tacked, its buildings' practically
wrecked, and money, arms and food
taken, according to eyewitnesses.
Inside, the office was a wreck, with
$600 missing from the strongbox, 10
horses gone from the corrals, and
every saddle taken from the stables.
From the mayordomo they took $500
and three horses. The bookkeeper's
office was looted and wrecked, and
bookkeeper Juan Laine was carried
off by the bandits, possibly to be held
for ransom. Four houndred troops are
quartered in Chalco, a few miles from
the hacienda Moral, but. according to
reliable in formation, they made no
movement to go after the bandits.
Loot ef Haelenda Guadalupe.
The hacienda de Guadalupe, which
is even closer to Chalco than EI Moral,
next received the attention of the same
band This is a larger place than El
Moral, and the bandits appeared to
have been augmented by considerable
reinforcements by the time it reached
Guadalupe.
It was looted, as was the first, and,
according to eyewitnesses, 10 little
girls were attacked by the bandits and
subjected to all manner of mistreat
ment. The looters cut the telephone
and telegraph wires, sacked the
church, 'ruining the Interior furnish
ings, and robbed the merchants and
officials of 1500 pesos. They they left
leisurely, threatening the terrified in
habitants with all manner of punish
ment if pursued.
Troops Were Near.
Col. Reynaldo Diaz with ample forces
for the punishment of the bandits, was
five kilometers from the hacienda Gua
dalpe, but made no movement, owing
to the fact, it is alleged, that he had
received no orders so to do from the
department of war. Such a bandit raid
dias not been made in the region for
more than 36 years, according to resi
dents of the vicinity.
Battle With Bandits.
A hundred Zapatistas passed through
the village of Tepandngo, Morelos, at
11 oclock last Wednesday morning and
at 3 oclock the same afternoon major
Caranza arrived. His vanguard had had
an encounter with the bandits, killing
one and taking three prisoners.
The fight occurred in the outskirts
of the-village of Guadalupe. The above
information was telegraphed yesterday
by Gov. Ambrosio Figueroa to the de
partment of goberriacion.'
Chinese Indemnity Settled.
"On or before July 1, 1912," is the
time fixed for the payment to China
of the 3,100,000 pesos as an Indemnity
for subjects of that country massacred
in Torreon during the recent revolu
tion. The protocol recording the agree
ment to the amount, and the time of
payment, formally was signed here
Saturday afternoon by representatives
of both governments. This amount is
by far the largest claim growing out
of the revolution, and to meet It
Mexico will, it is understood, float a
loan.
