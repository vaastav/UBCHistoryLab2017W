Editorial Comment
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S "KNOCK."
(From Thursday's Daily.)
Very little surprise need be felt at the attitude adopted to
wards joint statehood by President Roosevelt, as outlined in his
message to Congress yesterday. The people of Arizona have for
some time been cognizant of the fact that the President has been
under tnc mesmeric influence 01 senator uevendge on the ques
tion, but it was hoped that the enormous volume of evidence ten
dered by Arizona against the "unspeakable crime" of jointure
would have been instrumental in removing the spell ere the message
to Congress had been written, and that the entire matter would
have been left to the good judgment of the senate and legislature.
But no. In that self-assertive and pedantic style for which Pre
sident Roosevelt has made himself famous he announces that
'There is no justification for further delay, and the advisability of
making the four territories into two states has been clearly estab
lished." This positive attitude is a shock, indeed, and came to
Qu.r people yesterday as a,lIo;v for iich they were in no wise prepared;
It is auite evident from the President's announcement that'
he has subjected whatever personal opinions he may have held on
the subject to a promise given Senator Beveridge two years ago.
to the effect that he would help the Indiana legislator in his fight
for jointure. It therefore seems that he would help perpetrate an
unspeakable wrong on the people of Arizona merely because he
felt himself bound by an undertaking given before he had had any
definite or reliable data upon which to base an honest and just
judgment. This peculiar feature in President Rosevelt's character
has been productive of some extraordinary anomalies, and we in
Arizona are painfully aware of the lengths to which this blind
eyed worship of the supposed ideal has often led him. We have had
inflicted upon us in federal and territorial offices men at once incap
able, inexperienced, many of them grossly ignorant, and destitute
of qualifications, their only claim to any consideration being
that they had served in the ranks of the Rough Riders, and had
only done their duty as thousands of other citizens had done.
In short, the President subordinates everything to a fetich, and
comparative goodness or capacity count for but very little when
he bestows his patronage.
This attribute of President Roosevelt makes his pronuncia
mento on joint statehood all the more galling and unjust. Con
sideration for the people of Arizona and New Mexico is entirely
absent in the President's blunt and dictatorial statement. His re
commendation for jointure must go to Congress merely because he
has given a promise. The happiness and well-being of thousands
of our people, and of their children's children stands imperilled
just because the cursory investigation and visit paid the territories
by Senator Beveridge must be justified and the opinions formed
by the Indianan must be upheld! Truly this is injustice of the
basest and most despicable kind, a treachery that nothing can palli
ate, and probably without equal in the annals of American history.
For it cannot be contended that the President has not had the
other side of the question fully and often presented to him. Several
deputations of the best citizens of Arizona and New Mexico have
visited Washington and acquainted Mr. Roosevelt with the full
facts in connection with jointure. Hundreds of communications
have been sent him from people in the territories fully qualified to
speak with authority on the matter. The whole subject has been
threshed out over and over again in Congress, and the press has
given unlimited space to its discussion. It cannot therefore, be
said that the President acted without a full knowledge of what he
was doing end of what the. possible effect might be.
The President says that the "advisability for making the
four territories into two states has been clearly established." Per
haps, but only in the minds of himself and Senator Beveridge.
whose extraordinary bitterness , to Arizona and its people has
often been marvelled at. We have never yet seen the ghost of a
case made out for jointure in fact, the only argument in its favor
is that it would preserve the equilibrium in the Senate! And for
this dastardly and brutally selfish reason we arc to have our iden
tity wiped out, to be swallowed up in the maw of New Mexico,
and to remain for all time political nobodies, our rights stolen from
us, and our best interests at the mercy of a gang of office-hunters
and grafting politicians !
The cause of Arizona, however, is not yet lost. The President's
self-assertive and autocratic utterances and opinions have often fe
upon the deaf ears of our legislators, and we sincerely hope that
in this case the House will do justice to the territories, and refuse
to give assent to such an unparalleled and atrocious outrage as joint
ure would involve. We are strengthened in this belief by the re
cent visit of the Congressional deputation to our midst, and also by
visits from several individual Congressmen. These gentlemen, af
ter having made a thorough and exhaustive inquiry into the whole
question, confessed that there was no excuse for joining New
Mexico and Arizona together in unwilling bonds, and many of
them confessed that, while they had previously concurred in and
voted with Senator Beveridge on this question, they would from
henceforth be diametrically opposed to the jointure scheme, and also
that they would use their best influence in Senate and Congress
to prevent any measure of joint statehood from becoming law.
This gives us renewed hope, but the fight, without doubt, will be
waged without mercy in the present Congress, and the friends of
Arizona both at home and in Washington will need all the help
and succor possible. It is useless, we believe, to further parley
with President Roosevelt. His recommendation has gone forth
and, like Caesar, no power in heaven or in hell can change it. He
seems impervious to any sense of justice, and utterly regardless of
the consequences of his action. We believe in the justice of Con
gress, however, and hope and pray that jointure may be relegated
to oblivion and that, as a free, enlightened, wealthy and progressive
territory we may ultimately receive that measure of justice which
is our due, for which we have striven so long and honorably to make
ourselves worthy, and which, we firmly believe, in spite of the
President's recommendation, must ultimately come.
After his utterances of Tuesday, the President's previous high-
sounding declarations of a square deal for everybody must be re
garded as a fantasy of the brain. Henceforth, he must be considered
as a Dr. Tekyll in precept and a Mr. Hvde in practice.
OUR ATTITUDE COMMENDED.
in
x (From Friday's Daily.)
Judging by the expressions of opinion heard on all sides
Prescott yesterday, the stand taken by the Journal-Miner in its
criticism in yesterday's editorial of the unjust and ungenerous atti
tude adopted by President Roosevelt towards Arizona meets with
the hearty and whole-souled approval of our citizens. A continuous
stream of callers poured into the Journal-Miner office from an early
hour yesterday, the usual edition of the paper being.quickly exhaust
ed. It became necessary during the course of the day to print
large extra edition of the Journal-Miner, the papers being required
by our citizens to send to friends in Washington and the east.
Every caller at this office, without exception, expressed hearty ap
proval of the sentiments as voiced by this newspaper on the state
hood question, and more particularly regarding the atrocious at
tempt which has Deen, is being, and will be made in the present
Congress tolink us in an unholy. and. repulsive union with New
Mexico.
From all parts of Arizona'" come' like expressions of opinion
and it seems to us the territory has been aroused to a greater de
gree through the President's unworthy suggestion to Congress
than has ever previously been the case. While this is gratifying,
there is no time for delay in organizing all our forces for a final
and conclusive fight against ioint statehood. Everything that
can possibly be done must be done in order to stave off and defeat
the joint statehood bill. It is quite certain that Senator Bever-
dge, with the cunning and perspicacity for which he is famous,
has already planned a coup de gras tor this territory, and we be-
ieve that, if his efforts are to be defeated, we must concentrate our
forces, and make one last grind stand. Concentration is our
watchword. Surely, with the evidence of a people united in one
common cause, and declaring with no unmistakable voice "We will
not have it," the Congress of the United States, sent to-Washington
by the common people to legislate for the common welfare, will
lesitate, even at the behest of Roosevelt and Beveridge, to impose
upon people who do not want it the galling yoke of joint statehood.
Can our people stand idly by, and have their liberties filched from
them in such a barefaced and unconscionable manner? Do the
people of Arizona fully realize what jointure with New Mexico
means? Will they be content to have all their business transact
ed in a language and by a people with whom they never will have
anything in common? Are the people of Arizona satisfied to be
wallowed up, obliterated from the realm of political affairs, bound
hand and foot, and all their grand and heroic efforts in the building
of our territory swept aside forever? We say No, a thousand
times, No ! This great crime must not take place.
We want it distinctly understood that in this matter of joint
statehood, and indeed in all other matters, that the policy of
the Journal-Miner will be directed towards the welfare of Arizona
rst and always. We are not among those who believe that the
king can do no wrong." President Roosevelt, by the great injus
tice which he has done toward Arizona, is deserving of the severest
criticism. He seems, judging by his message of yesterday, to re
gard with feelings of contempt the universal and often-expressed
wishes of the people of Arizona regarding joint statehood. Ac
cording to Mr. Roosevelt, Arizona is incapable of knowing what is
good for the territory, and is undeserving of a voice in the decision
of its fate. He brushes the territories aside in his peculiarly dic
tatorial manner, and in blunt and cold-blooded language recom
mends what would amount to the complete extinction of Arizona
as a political entity. Party loyalty must always fail to support
such a burden. The thief that would come to the house of a citi
zen and rob him of all he possessed would deserve and receive con
dign punishment. But this jointure proposition is thievery on a
colossal scale, and thievery in as culpable a form as any of which
we can conceive.
Let the people of Arizona awaken to the enormity of the issue
and the magnitude of the fight before them. We have good
friends in Congress, but will need them all in the coming battle.
It will not do to sit still in the present crisis. Action is necessary,
and we would here and now urge on our political leaders of all
phases of opinion to concentrate and organize the anti-joint state
hood forces of our people into an overpowering and irresistible
avalanche that Congress must and shall obey.

OSCAR
BRUCKMAN IS D2CLABED
NOT GUILTY.
(From Sunday's Daily.)
The jury in the case of the Unitei
States against Oscar Bruckman, charg
ed -with selling whisky to Indians,
brought in .a verdict last night at 7:30
o'clock of not guilty, and the defend
ant was given his liberty. The jury de
liberated' about two and one-half houra
before arriving at a decision. On Mon
day his brother, Richard M. Bruck
man, - appears for trial on a similar of
fense, the allegation being that tho
charge is but. a similar one, the trans
action having taken place at the samo
time as the offense for which his bro
ther was indicted, the two brothers be
ing indicted separately.

something of a- sensation is in store for
those interested when court will con'
vene on Monday morning. Before the
case against Bruckman was commenc
ed for trial yesterday, United States
Attornev Alexander made the state
ment .to the court that he believed that
Ben Williams, the well known: Navajo
Indian interpreter, who was -present in
the city, was tampering with the In-
dian witnesses for the prosecution, in
an endeavor to keep them from tell
ing the truth in the cases against the
Bruckmans, also alleging that "Wil
hams had already influenced several
Indians to the extent of blocking the
ends of justice so far as the govern-
ment was to be considered. He aske.l
that a citation be issued for the appear
ance of Williams before the court on
Monday, the charge against him be
ing contempt. Accordingly this cita
tion was issued by Judge Sloan, and
Williams will answer at that tim
to tho charge made.
Mr. Alexander also stated in support
of the allegation he makes that Wil
liams was seen talking to several In
dian witnesses and that he impressed
upon them the belief that the Bruck
mans were friendly to the Indians
hence they should if anything, favor
them as friends in the trial to be
given. One Indian witness who was
called to testify later on behalf of
the prosecution, could not be made to
open his mouth or to understand what
was desired of him.
The Bruckmans conduct an Indian
trading post about twelve miles from
Winslow, and are said to be doing a
profitable business among the Nava-
os.
"While in the past there have been
many similar cases before the United
States court in this city, this particu
lar one, however, surpasses in interest
and consideration all former trials ia
this channel, owing to the fact that
.the officials interested have been more
than ordinarily indulgent, and the ac
cused men prominently known as
dian traders in northern Arizona.

The mining domain or "Yavapai
county is a big and inviting one. Hard
Iy a day passes but what is not chron
icled the arrival in Prescott of some
one with evidences of the wealth that
lies hidden. This was so with A. A.
"Wagner, the miner man who is lo
cated near Bumblebee in the. Black
Canyon country, and who leaves today
for Ohio, where he will interview sev
eral friends and endeavor to persuade
them to become interested in what he
possesses in mining ground in that sec
tion. He owns 3 group of four
claims, known as tt o Jack Babbit, and
on which he has been extensively devel
oping for some time. To support the
fine showing they mahe he brings a
magnificent sample of tho ore that
was taken from the bottom of a 40
foot shaft, in the frrza. of wire gold
that is pronounced by mining men as
the finest specimen of gold-ore ever
shown in this city. Xft
'Mr. "Wagner necessarily feels very
much elated .over the finding of this
ore at that depth, and believes that
when the ground is exploited to great
er depth it has every indication of
supporting a permanent and profitable
mining enterprise. In addition to
this rich sample of ore which he ex
hibits, he also carries other samples of
the product, showing the mineralogical
make-up of the ores of his claims.
The Jack Babbit gronp are old Id
eations, and through the foresight of
Mr. Wagner, backed by a keen know
ledge of the possibilities of mining, to
gether with muscular assistance, he
has demonstrated what others havo
failed in, that a mistake was made in
not practically handling the ground
by the original locators, when the indi
cations justified what is being proven
today.
The section in which this group is
located is rapidly coming to the front.
Many clams are under operation there,
and now jhat the possibilities of the
Jack Rabbit are so excellent, it is but
reasonable to anticipate general good
showings,- among all of the claims
there. ,
Mr. Wagner's many friends will be
pleased to learn of his good fortune,
and it is to be sincerely hoped that he
will have an opportunity to demon
strate the merit of the proposition that
seems si attractive by what he shows
and what he believes to be in store.
