WHAT DOES IT MEAK?
Is the Revenue Cutter Going to
Brins: Liliuokalani Here?
Perhaps the Queen Has Accepted that
SoOO.000 Bribe, and Wants to Visit
Gresham and Cleveland.
SAN FRANCISCO. Dec. 4. The United
States revenue cutter Thomas Corwln Is
under special orders for a 2.500 mile trip.
Her destlnaUon is Honolulu, without doubt.
Whether any person In diplomatic author
ity 13 coming here from Washington to go
to the islands on the Corwln Is not known.
It is quite likely, however, that a special
messenger intrusted with secrets of state
will be the emissary who will occupy one
of the state rooms already set apart In the
after cabin. The greatest secrecy has been
maintained since the special orders arrived
Saturday noon. These turned the cutter
over to the State . Department and placed
her under waiting orders. Instructions were
also given to prepare for a 2.500 mile voyage
and to be ready to sail In forty-eight "hours.
A heavy supply of coal has been stowed
on the Corwin's decks, In addlUon to that
inthe bunkers.
Yot Denied by Grenhani.
WASIIINGTON.Dec. 4. Secretary Gresh
am declined to say anything this morning
in regard to the report published that tho
revenue cutter Thomas Corwln was to car
rv a message on behalf of the State De
partment from 6an Francisco to Honolulu.
There is reason to suppose, however, that
the story Is substantially correct. Secre
tary Gresham was very busy with dis
patches during the latter part of yesterday
which are to go on the Corwln. As to
what these contain nothing can be learned.
Secretary Gresham was very emphatic In
his assertions, at different times, that Min
ister Willis had received no further in
structions since his departure from this
country, and that he needed none. This
gives rise to the surmise that the dispatch
in haste of a special messenger at this
time can only be caused by a change in
the policy Intended to be pursued.
An effort to learn from the officials on
duty in the Treasury Department whether
the Corwln has been turned over to the State
Department to convey messages to Minister
Willis met with but little success. An un
usual amount of reticence is manifested in
connection with the subject The fact that
no denial is made of the published state
ments regarding the matter is accepted
generally as an Indication that the reports
are correct, and that the vessel is now at
the disposal of the department. She is in
good condition for travel and could make
the trip in about nine days, or about the
same time occupied by the Rush when slo
took Commissioner Blount to the island.
REPENT AT LEISURE.
The Slastbaura-Van Kirk Marriage Will
Soon Be Annulled.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
DANVILLE, 111.. Dec. 4. Word was re
ceived here to-day that proceedings would
be Instituted In the courts at Chicago to
annul the romantic marriage of Julius
Mastbaum, of this city, and Julia Van
Kirk, of Chicago. When the bride left
here Wednesday it was understood that
she would meet her husband In Chicago,
and it was supposed that the affair would
come to a happy conclusion and the young
couple would live together. When she ar
rived at the Chicago depot she was met by
Mr. Fuber and other Chicago friends. She
came to the conclusion that she had made
a mistake In accepting the situation. She
remained with her friends in Chicago and
Mr.. Mastbaum went to his parents in
Philadelphia. Mr. Mastbaum's power of at
torney consenting to a decree of divorce
was sent to Edwin Winter, an attorney
of this city, who returned it to the friends
of Mis3 Van Kirk In Chicago, where it is
thought a suit will soon be brought to an
nul the marriage.
Mr. Foy at Insane.
CHICAGO, Dec. 4. One of the assistant
attorneys for the prosecution In the Coush

statement that Mrs. Foy is insane. Mrs.
Foy ij the woman who has told a sensa
tional story of the Cronin murder, alleged
to have been gleaned from her husband,
who, she claims, was one of the conspira
tors. In the Coughlln trial to-day the search for
Jurors was continued. The defense exer
cised lis last peremptory challenge on Her
man -Husch, a restaurant man. who lived
in Chicago for three years, and who said
he had never heard of the Cronin case until
last Saturday. Jerry Flynn, the clerk sus
Iended a week ago on suspicion of having
tampered with the Jury list, was reinstated
to-day. Flynn filed an aiiidavlt declaring
his innocence of the charge against him.

Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON, Dec. t-Evasive, barren
and weak that is the preponderance of
opinion in "Washington to-night of the mes
sage which President Cleveland seit to
Congress te-day. Never was there a great
er disappointment in a public document.
Under the almost uneiampled stress of
commercial conditions It was expected that
the President would make some important
recommendations, would point out reme
dies for the financial distress, the business
depression which abounds the country over,
but he has failed in all objects but evasion.
Wherever he has attempted to speak out
he has beclouded his purposes. He has of
fered nothing but a homely, lifeless, im
personal and meaningless review of the
past nine months of government work.
It appears that the only ones who have
been or will be benefited by the message
are Britten speculators. The full contents
of the message were in the hands of Lombard-street
speculators last night, and all
London took advantage of thb information
upon our markets this morning. There was
heavy selling on the Board of Trade in
New York from London at the opening of
the market this morning. No buying or
ders came from London, and it was not
long before a cable inquiry brought the in
telligence that London speculators were
taking advantage of the President's mes
sage. This is not the first time British
speculators have been taken Into the con
fidence of President Cleveland. They dis
counted his call for an extra session of
Congress and his silver message. They
have the inside Information upon all of his
official acts far In advance of American cit
izens. MR. JOHNSON'S VIEWS.
The Journal correspondent to-night called
upon the Republican members of the Indi
ana delegation and requested their views
upon the message, and below they gie
them in a way most interesting to Iloosler
readers. Representative Henry U. Johnson
said :
"An opportunity to send in a strong mes
sage has been lost. The document is a
mediocre one in every respect, and will add
nothing to Mr. Cleveland's reputation. It
is entirely too long for the small amount
of good matter which it contains. It
abounds In statistics and facts taken from
the reports of the various heads of de
partments, and which properly belong
therein, but It will not at all answer as a
substitute for these reports. In this par
ticular the message cannot be said to be
labor saving. The number of acres an
nually planted with seeds distributed by
tho Agricultural Department la set forth
with punctilious exactness, but one looks
in vain for some reference to the proposi
tion to repeal the ten-per-cent. tax on State
bank circulation, now pending before the
committee on banking and currency, and
which many Democratic Representatives
are determined shall be favorably reported
and enacted into a law. The vast impor
tance of the banking system to the coun
try would have fully justified a presiden
tial treatment of the subject.
"The favorable reference to civil-service
reform is almost ludicrous, in view of the
character of some of the President's ap
pointments and the notorious disregard of
the civil-service law in the classified serv
ice of the government, where competent
employes are being reduced and discharged
upon flimsy pretexts, and simply to make
way for Democrats. Xo additional light is
thrown upon the Hawaiian question, but
Congress and the country are graciously
informed that when the experiment has
been tried the result will bo communicated.
In the treatment of this subject, however,
it is noticeable that the President Is some
what sensitive to the charge that he is
acting without due regard to the constitu
tional limitations which surround the ex
ecutive department in such matters.
"The treatment of the pension question i3
on a par with the well-known views of Mr.
Cleveland with respect to the pension list.
His language, is very similar to that em
ployed by him la a previous document re
lating to the question. The declaration that
many names have been put upon the pension
roll by means of wholesale and gigantic
frauds, and that thousands v f neighborhoods
have their well-known fraudulent pensioners
are outrageously false, and his efforts to
Justify the cruel policy of the Pension Office
by citing alleged precedents when that
otHce was under Republican management
will deceive no one. The country fully un
derstands the difference between the Re
publican and Dmocratlc construction of the
pension laws and administration of the
Pension Bureau, and the oil soldiers know
where to locate the responsibility for their
mistreatment.
"The do-nothing policy seems to bo the
one recommended with respect to the money
question, and yet the suggestion that au
thority be conferral to issue bonds and the
expression of indifference as to the reas
sembling of the International monetary con
ference are quite significant.. Mr. Cleve
land evidently favors the single gold stand
ard, with power to sell bonds and obtain
additional gold reserve with which to main
tain silver coin at a parity, yet he is lack
ing in aggressiveness of statement on this
point and leaves something to inference.
"lie commits himself squarely to the
provisions of the Wilson tariff bill so far
as the provlsons of this measure are made
known, and contents himself with the fa
miliar arguments that have been exploded
time and again. In his anxiety to go Into
grinding competition with cheap-labor na
tions for the 'markets of the world,' he
seems to lo? sight of the fact that even
thse markets have, under such competi
tion, a limit, and that the homo market is
liable to escape us. Free raw innteral alone
will not enable us to share neu
tral markets with other manufac
turing nations. We must have
cheap labor also. The laboring men
of 'this country will hardly be deceived by
the presidential assurance that wages can
bo maintained here under a policy that
aim at ruinous- cheapness In manufacture.
The Indorsement of the Wilson bill by the
President, however, renders it highly prob
able that this measure will ultimately be
come a law substantially as reported by
the committee on ways and means. The
power of the executive to Influence legis
lation has just had a striking illustration
in the passage of the bill for the repeal of
the purchasng clause of the Sherman act
at the special session of Congress."
DISSECTED BY DAN WAUGII.
Representative Dan Waugh, of Tipton,
said:
"The message was very lengthy, and but
little more than a detailed statement of the,
workings and condition of the several de
partments of the government, which could
be drawn up by any experienced clerk.
That portion of It relating to Hawaiian,
matters was a great disappointment, it
g.ve no further information than the coun
try has already had through the public
press. The treatment of the tariff subject
created the only interest manifested dur
ing the reading of the message, and that
was only a repetition of the views of the
President heretofore expressed. On the
whole. Judging from the lack of interest
and empty seats at the close of the read
ing of the message, it was a disappoint
ment to a good many of our Democratic
friends. As a State'papcr it falls far below
the message to ' the extra session- There
never was, perhaps, in the history of the
country a message delivered to Congress
under such peculiar circumstances. Con
gress had been in session three months, and
the only legislation suggested by the Presi
dent as being needed by the country was
the repeal of the purchasing clause of the
Sherman law. Congress, however, did not
step with ine accomplishment of that leg
islation but went ahead, presented and
fcrmulated legislation upon almost every
important public question.
"The policy of the administration In every
department of the government had been
established and known to the country.
Tl ere seamed to be but little use for
a message. Tha only thing for the
President to do was to indorse his own
administration and the act of Congress.
This he seems to have done, Gresham, "my
commissioner," Hoke Smith, all. In the
administration of affairs we have the
strango reversal of thr natural order of
things. In the executive and legislative
branch of the government we have tho
rule of legislation nrst and the message
afterward. In tho Mate Department wo have
the rule to recoynize a lepubllc and theu
destroy it, in order to boost a half-civilized
Queen upon a tottering throne. In the In
terior Department we have the rule, hang
tne old soldier ana try him afterwards.
Yet, I presume in the work of destruction
you may have rules and order the same as
in any other business.
"The President indorses the Hoke Smith
raid upon the soldiers. This will not please
some Northern Democrats, who want their
votes to return them to Congress. It is
rumored that a few Democrats threaten to
commence a light upon the administration
policy of dropping pensioners from the roll
without notice or hearing. Why didn't they
commence the fight sooner? The Hoke
Smith rebellion has been going on for eight
months. Why have they waited until more
than fifteen thousand soldiers have been
suspended from the roll as frauds and sus
pects? Why have they waited until they
heard the wavering voice from Ohio, New
York and other States in November last.
This threatened fight will fool no one. It
will be a fight by agreement only, a plav
for votes, and to be kept before the public
until the next general election. These same
men who now feign friendship for the sol
dier would vote for Cleveland or Hoke
Smith if nominated for President in IS'rf.
This administration war on the old soldier
has made him an Issue In politics again.
The Republican party, which has always
leen his friend, should gladly accept the
Issue. It has never lost a battle since the
war while fighting his cause, but failed .and
lost when his name and achievements were
mentioned In campaigns only In a whisper
for fear of offending some helf-hearted pa
triot. The great soldier family constitute
one-third the voting population of the coun
try, and are Interested In his being pro
tected under the law. as much as pig iron
and- wool, and will be a source of great
strength to us in 18!U and 1. if not whis
pered to death. I like the manly course of
the Journal; it's not afraid to speak out."

WASHINGTON, Dec 4.-It is not often
that the public awaits a President's mes
sage with the intensity which has been
manifested In the document to-day sent to
Congress. The message was listened to
with close attention In both houses and the
views of members on the document ara
pertinent and Interesting Just at this time.
Ex-Speaker Reed said: "I dislike to com
ment on the message, because it would not
be seemly to do It in adequate terms. It
is exceedingly disappointing both In matter
and manner. It Is largely made up of a
wearisome resume of the reports of his
secretaries, which they have hardly Im
proved by condensation. On the Hawaiian
question we are left as much in the dark
as ever, and must wait the news of the
next steamer just as we have been waiting
so long. That part of the message which
relates to the tariff Is most surprising. It
asseverates that the House committee in
chargo of that subject has i formulated
plans and devised methods of taxation
which, as a member of the committee, I
have not even heard proposed. It is a
rather unusual sensation to learn of the
deeds -of the committee, not Ih the com
mittee room, but from the President of the
United States. Has that committee ceased
even In form to be composed of both par
ties, and has it, without even the formality
of a word In open committee, Informed
the President of its determination in such
way that the President can officially com
municate it to the House? How Ions has
it been part of our system that the com
riUtee of an 'Independent branch, and,
alove all, the committee which control the
purse shall report to Congress through the
President? Is It the result of rumored
blending of the appointive with the legisla
tive power? It is bad enough to have a
tariff bill made up by. a little coterie
Political bill as Mr. Wilson calls it but
to have it communicated to the President
before It reaches even the committee and
still less the House, shows a determination
to bo moved by no facts and modified by
no arguments, and makes apparent the ab
surdity of apiointing Republicans on ways
and means at all."
Mr. Springer, chairman of the last com
mittee on ways and means and of the
banking and currency committee of the
present Congress, said: "In reference to
the tariff the mes.sage Is clear and forci
ble. In this the message will receive the
cordial commendation of everj" Democrat
in the land, and of many ethers who real
ize that our present protective svstem is
injurious to the best interests of the peo
ple. In reference to the currency the Pres
ident very hopefully anticipates that a
survey of the situation, after public con
fidence Is restored, will lead to a perma
nently sound currency. This view of the
subject excludes definitely and forever the
policy of a return to the alluring and tem
porary expedient of State banks of issue.
The President is evidently opposed to the
repeal of the 10 per cent, tax on the cir
culation of 'State banks. In reference to
Hawaii the President takes the only course
which Is consistent with international
honor and comity."
Mr. Holman said: "It is an able and
forcible document. The earnest expecta
tions of economy contrasts strongly with
mes-sues heretofore presented."
Mr. McCreary, chairman of the foreign
affairs committee: "It Is an able and ap
propriate document. It furnishes much
valuable Information. He presents our for
eign affairs, monetary matters and the
tariff with great ability, and I think his
recommendations ar generally good."
Mr. Oat en said: "I listened attentively.
It abounds in details and Is full of Informa
tion about the departments, but makes
few recommcndatlos."
LACKS CLEAR 'EXPRESSION.
Mr. Dolliver, of Iowa: "The message Is,
in most respects, formal. In the matters
of public Interest that are in dispute the
message lacks any satisfactory expression.
In respect to Hawaii the President con
ceals from Congresn all Information that
Is important, and seems to know really
less about the situation than Is known to
the general public As to silver the Presi
dent lacks the courage to state his views
and commits the whole subject to the
policy of delay. On the question of Issu
ing bonds to maintain our currency and to
meet the deficit of insufficient revenues
the President's language is wanting in
dellniteness, and makes no pretc-nse of a
leadership of public opinion. He seems to
have exhausted hla power of leadership In
the midsummer attack on the interests of
silver. The President's views on the tariff
are well known, and his ardent support of
the proposed Wilson bill surprises no
body." Chairman Wilson, of the ways and means
committee: "The President's message is all
right. He Is especially right on the tariff."
Mr. Cobb, of Missouri: "I am heartily in
accord with, the message and its conclu
sions.' " Mr. Tracey: "I am satisfied with it It
is a good message."
Mr. Gear, of I6wa, a member of the com
mittee on way and means: "The President
says that he will restore Liliuokalani. gives
the majority of the ways and means com
mittee away on the Income tax, and agree9
with Hancock that the tarjff is a Jocal
Issue, and asks the people not to kick."
Mr. Uynum, a memb'V of the ways and
means committee: "It x u very concise but
clear statement of the multitude of ques
tions Congress will be called upon to con
sider. The principal views presented meet
my unqualified approval. I am especially
pleased with the tariff question and the
rouracriNvtia manner the President came to
the support cf the committee, as tariff re-
form could not be accompnsneu. wiinoui
the support of the administration."
Mr. Fickler: "The assertion of the Presi
dent that there are great and gigantic frauds
In connection with the pension rolls and
large numbers of fraudulent pensioners
upon the rolls is wholly unsubstantiated
by facts." t .
Mr. Caldwell: "The President indicates
that every pensioner received his pension
by fraud, and defends his action in sus
pending pensions without giving the old
soldiers a hearing by asserting it is the
French method. He still maintains his un
American policy regarding the restoration
of Qu-en Liliuokalani.- His recommenda
tions of an income tax upon corporations
will not only decrease the wages of the
workingmen. but Increase the cost of the
product to the consumer."
"GOD SAVE OUR QUEEN."
Mr. Hopkins, of Illinois, said: "-The gen
eral tone of the message Is quite character
istic of the President. A large part of the
message is flat, stale and unprofitable, be
ing simply an unnecessary elaboration of
the facts presented in ' the reports from
various departments of the government.
He vouchsafes to the people no Information
regarding the Hawaiian situation .more
than we heretofore had through the public
press. He confirms, however, the rumor
that he is thoroughly committed to the
overthrow of the present provisional gov
ernment and the restoration of the Queen
Hereafter the slogan of Democracy snoultl
be 'God save our Queen.' The message op
the. silver question is vague and uncertain.
It commits the administration fully to the
indorsement and approval of the Wilson
bill, one of the 'worst bills in the way of
tariff legislation, in my Judgment, vrhlch
has ever been presented to the considera
tion of the House of Representatives."
Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, said: "It seems
to me the message is not satisfactory to
either the frelnds or opixments of the ad
ministration. It gives an Imperfect ab
stract of the departmental rerorts. The
country was expecting definite information
touching our relations with Hawaii. Specific
information as to what the President Is
doing and will do is withheld. The Presi
dent recommends amendatory legislation
touching the issuance of government bonds.
He does not 'siiy for what purpose. His in
dorsement of the tariff bill not passed by
the committee or reported to the Hoise
Is unusual l mL.y say unprecedented. The
message will not tend In any respect to re
store confidence to the producing and com
mercial interests of the country."
Representative C'aruth: "The message is,
of 'course, a stronge paper. It could not
be otherwise and come from G rover Cleve
land. It is wise, patriotic and Democratic."
Mr. Poutelle: "It is the first executive
document which directly impugned and
charged malfeasance - In ofiloe and practic
ally treason upon a United States minister,
against whom nothing was charged by the
administration up to the time his resigna
tion was accepted. The people of London
may be aware cf the-policy which the ruler
of the United States pursues and his au
thority for making war, tearing, down and
putting up government, but we are not."
Air. Payne, a member of the ways and
means committee: "The message its a re
markably disappointing document. It is
mainly devoted to a resume of the reports
of the several departments, to which the
President seldom adds an opinion of his
own. 'On important matters it gives little
informatior On Hawaii affairs it gives us
no Information. His announcement of the
internal revenue feature of the plans of the
ways and means committee is astounding.
This Is the first Information the minority
members have had that any conclusion has
been reached. If reports are correct the
Ieople of Londo.-. were informed on this im
Iortant matter much earlier than members
of the committed. The question now(seems
to be whether all legis-'Utlon must originate
at the White House."
"SILENT AS THE GRAVE."
Mr. Dingley: "The message is volumin
ous in Its resume of the details of the work
of the several departments, and wearisome
in Its recapitulation of the smaller Inci
dents of the questions which have arisen
in our foreign affairs, but on the one great
foreign question which Congress as well
as the country ought to know the.exact sit
uation, to-wit: our relations with Hawaii,
the message is as silent as the grave, be
yond a repetition of the announcement
made by Secretary Gresham. Instead of
some recommendation on the currency ques
tion, we have simply 'delay' suggested as
to silver .and silence as to the plan to re
store the State banking system and to pro
vide for currency wants in the future."
Mr. Dalzell, a member of the ways and
means committee: "The President says
that after full discussion our countrymen
have spoken in favor of tariff reform, and
have confided the work of the accom
plishment to the hands of those who1 are
solemnly pledged to it. I infer that by the
latter expression the President means the
majority of the ways and means commit
tee, and by 'tariff reform the proposed
mongred bill given to the press a week ago.
It would seem' that the President has not
yet heard the news from Massachusetts,

When he refers to the reduction of tartff
charges on the necessaries of life I sup
pose he has reference to champagne and
brandy. The fact that the President rcas-
serts the time worn and so often and, under
the operations of the McKlnley law, so em
phatically disproven assertion that a' pro
tective tariff Increases the cost of goods
to the consumer, shows what a hide-bound
theorist the President is. and how facts
weigh nothing with a tariff reformer. On the
whole, he must be a most devoted admirer
of the- President who can find in the mes
sage any strengthening of the Demo
cratic iositlon on the tariff question."
Mr. Hepburn said: "The mes.sage Is a
business paper, devoted mainly to the busi
ness of condensing the statements and rec
ommendations of the Secretaries. Neces
sarily, it is tedious and dreary. The discus
sion of the Hawaiian policy is disappoint
ing. He favors tarhf reform, but whether
it Is tariff reform of the variety of 1SSS or
1S92 is left in doubt. I do not think the
message will add to the President's fame or
harmonize the contentions in his party."
Senator Voorhees: "In the main the mes
sage is a sound, strong document. I have
not examined it critically ' and cannot go
into details. I think It will be well re
ceived by the country."
Senator McPherson: "It Is excellent all
the way through. 1 was especially pleased
with the recommendations In regard to the
general finances and the tariff, and as to
the principles involved in the tariff bill."
Senator Murphy: "It Is a good message."
Senator Kyle: "There was nothing strik
ing in the message, though it contained
some good points. I was pleased with hi3
recommendations for an income tax, but
what he said about Hawaii and his recom
mendations concerning the issuance of
bonds were not to my liking."
Senator Morrill: "The President's in
dorsement of a tariff bill not yet agreed
upon In committee was very unexpected
and remarkable."
Senator Hlor: "It was a most remark
able message In several respects. It treats
the Important questions affecting the wel
fare of the country feebly and briefly. The
imputation of the President concerning civil-service
reform, to the effect that the law
was enacted because of fear of public opin
ion, and not because of the conviction of
the legislators who enacted It, is without
precedent. This reflection comes with an
ill grace from a Presldr- ho 'has dealt,
as the existing Presiden- .ias den It, with
the consular service of the United States
without even taking advice of his Secre
tary of State, and whose apjointment of
Van Alen has been such an offense to the
country's sense of decency. The message
Is further remarkable In stating the re

mined upon it, and before some of its mem-

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.-Thc President's
message, was submitted to Congress at 1:35
o'clock this afternoon. It follows:
To the Congress of the United States:
The constitutional duty which requires
the President from time to time to fcdve to
the Congress information of the stateof
the Union and recommend to its considera
tion such measures as he shall judge neces
sary and expedient. Is fittingly entered upon
by commending to the Congress a careful
examination of the detailed statements find
all supported recommendations contained
in the reports of the heads of d?partments
who ore chiefly charged with the executive
work of the government. In an effort to
abridge this communication as much as 13
consistent with its purpose, I shall supple
ment a brief reference to the contents of
those departmental reports by the mention
of such executive business and incidents
as are embraced therein, and by such rec
ommendations as appear to be at this par
ticular time appropriate.

While our foreign , relations have not at
all times during the past year been entirely
free from perplexity, no embarrassing situ-
atlon remains that will not yield to the
spirit of fairness and love of Justice, which.
joined with consistent firmness, character
ize a truly American foreign policy.
It is hardly necessary for me to state
that the questions arising from our rela
tions with Hawaii have caused serious em
barrassment. Just prior to the installation
of the present administration the existing
government of Hawaii had been suddenly
overthrown and a treaty of annexation had
been negotiated between the provisional
government of the islands and the United
States and submitted to the Senate for rat
ification. Th!s treaty I withdrew for exam
ination and dispatched Hon. James II.
Ulount, of Georgia, to Honolulu as a spe
cial commissioner, to make an Impartial
Investigation of the circumstances attend
ing the change of government, and of all
the conditions bearing upon the subject of
the treaty. After a thorough and ex
haustive examination Mr. Illount submitted
to me his report, showing beyond all ques
tion that the constitutional government of
Hawaii had been subverted with the active
aid of our representative to that govern
ment and through the intimidation caused
by the presence of an armed naval force
of the United States, which was landed for
that purpose at the Instance of our min
ister. Upon the facts developed it seemed
to mo the only honorable course for our
government to pursue was to undo the
wrong that had been done by those repre
senting us, and to restore a3 far as prac
ticable the status existing at the time of
our forcible Intervention. With a view of
accomplishing this result within the consti
tutional limits of executive power, and rec
ognizing all our obligations and responsi
bilities growing out of any change of condi
tions brought about by our unjustiilable in
terference, our present minister at Hono
lulu has receive I appropriate instructions to
that end. Thus far no information of tho
accomplishment of any definite result has
been received from him. Additional ad
Vices are soon expected. When received
they will be promptly sent to the Congress,
together with all other information at hand,
accompanied by a special executive message
fulljj detailing all the facts necessury to a
complete understanding of the case, and
presenting a history of all the material
events leading up to the present situation.

My predecessor having accepted the olTico

Tho legislation of last year, known as th
Geary law, requiring the registration cf all
Chinee laborers entitled to residence la
the United States and the dei-crtatioa of
all not complying with the provisions of
the act within the time prescribed, met
with much opposition from. Chinamen in
this country. Acting uion the advice of
eminent counsel, who sni 1 the law was un
constitutional, the great mas3 cf Chlacsa

vaJJ liiy. in poM faith, declined to apply
for the'certhlcates required by Its proi-
lijPH. A test ease. tiior iroe.--fln.: Ly

ing the law. It is believed that under the

ers thereto entitle'., who deslro to reside
in thli country. v ill now avail themselves
of the renewed privilege thus afforded of,
establishing by lawful procedure their

It has devolved uio:i tne cnuea stales

vital interest to nil countru whose citi

of tho slave trade and the restriction of

to adopt appropriate means for tha
punishment of persons selling arms

for the confiscation " of the Inhib

this govornmtnt to ail in suppressing the
nefarious tram? impairing, as it does, the
praiseworthy and civilizing efforts now in
progress in that region. I rfommc-nd that
an act be passed prohibiting the Hole of
