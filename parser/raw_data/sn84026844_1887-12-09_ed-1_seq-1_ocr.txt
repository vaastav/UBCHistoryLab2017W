Tho roll wa3 thou called, and every

At this point Gen. J. H. Syplier, Green

well as to participate in a Republican love
feast to night, to which all Republican

at once decided to lenvo their contracted

THE APPLICANTS FOR THE LOCATION,
A recess was taken long enough to enable

called the members to order an informal
discussion ensu*d as to the time which

tho various cities which aro ompotingfor
?he prikO of holding the next Republican

Tho World then adds: "The Repnb-1
'licaus had four queationo asked, their]
presidential choice Going doaired a* well aa
their vie no on the President's tariff re-1
commendationa. Ab to tho first,as will bo
seen by the tabulation, the balk of the
conservative i legislators were inclined to be
non-commital, while a goodly number
contented themselves with tho sole announcement,
"rha choico of the Convention."
Of course they did not bubble over
with praiabof the President's tariff recommendations.
"A. school boy corapoeition"
was a favorite phrase. Some of
them were candid enough to say tbat at
any rate the President had raised an issue,
oat they believed it to be au iasue thnt
wouid work to the rain of the Democratic
party. Blain&'s adherents in particular
were impressed with thio idea, and
prophesied that on tho issue of protection
versus freo trade tho Plumed Knight
would sweep the country.
Senator Sherman declined to discues the
Presidential question or the tariff, saying
that the proceedings in the Senate during
tho nest ionr weeks would show wliat was
thougnt ol the President's ideaa.
Senator EJmuudo declined to dieenss
the Presidential question, and said that
tho message would no doubt please the
English.
Benatoro Sabia and Davis Gaid Blaine
was strong in Minnesota. Sabin favored
the roraovai ol the duty on suRar, and a
reduction of one-halt on oteel rails.
Senutor Quay favored Blaino and the
repeal of the internal rovenuo taxes before
touching tho duties on imports.
Secaior Sawyer said tho message was a
freo trade stump epcech.
8enator Stanford favored tho repeal of
tho internal rovonua taxes, and was for
tho man nominated.
Senator Farwoll said he wa3 in favor of
Blaine, but would support tho man selected
by the delegates from Now York State.
He favored tli? removal of the teres on

Gen. Fryo, cl Maine, was "for Blaine

seemed to bo imbued with a kind of oxaltntlon

Along tho ttidge natural gas ctAnd pipes
wore ended at frequent intervals, and
many houdeu w?ro huudflouioly decorated
in honor ot the Jubilee. A novel feature
in tho way ol making noiee was a whistlo
attached to a natural gas otaud pipe, and
the way it Berthed when tho gas tickled
its metal ribs would have made a fox horn
look up mearprlae. 8uvoril of these ear
tortures wero stationed in different parts
of the town. A very pretty decoration
was the natural gas arch in front of tho
West Virginia Fire JJtfck Company's
cilice. Anothor natural jmo arch spanned
tno railroad just aboyo tho depot, depending
from which was tho illuminated word
"welcome." A decoration that struck
tho ejo was a placard in tbe garden in

on the Ridge, which bore the following
legend:

Long before tho hour set for tho arrival
of the trains from Wheeling and Pittsburgh
people could be oeon wending their

Pittsburgh train hevo in eight it waa
greeted with tho eereeching of whistles,
tho boom oE the cannon, and tho clanging

noisy, if not a most cordial welcorao.
At the depoS the brass band

welcomed by,the Mayor and the Citterns'

THE JOLLIFICATION.
After the feaatof pood things had been

and townspeople repaired to the hall of

about thu same number of tire brick works

But even this drawback could not

has doubled its capacity, and now
comes the helping hand of tho iron horse
j that will encourage them to greator enter|
prises, and lead them out of tho wilderness
in which thoy havo dwelt mauy years
longer than Btrayed the Israelites of old.
It is now a demonstrated fact that the
town has found
Thu way ?bo long has sought,
And mourned bccauscthe found It not.
That is, a substantial railway over which
hor goods can he carried to the markets
that are sighing for them, because they
will have no other. It is not liko some

that is plainly demonstrated. "What

TUB NEED or THH U.VILKDAL).
Of courso overy town io benefitted by a
railroad, but there aro some towns to
whom greater advantages accrue than
others, and Kew Cumborland is one of
them. Tho short talk had with Mr. B.
J. 8mith, president of McMahon, Porter
& (Jo.'s concern, fully substantiates this
point. He :a one of the moat enthusiastic
raou in tho Brick City over tho advent of
the railroad, nnd it iB little wonder that
' he is as smiliDg and happy as a boy with
j a firot pair of boots. Said Mr. Smith, in
answer to an inquiry of the reporter:'
"Yes, this railroad will be of untold boneI
fit to Now Cumberland. Why, look what
i wo had to contond with in ohipping. Low
water in suminor and ice in winter,' When
there was a good stage of water there was
a doublo handling of tho products, which,
of course, added to their cost, Besides
there was a ecaroity of cars, the Cleveland
& Pittsburgh being unable to furnish the
nnantitv deairad. Often flat' lnndn nf
uricka and sower pips bavo lain two weeks
waiting shipment. Now all is changed,
and it would bs superfluous to add that
wa are highly glad of it."
"And that it is worth a jollifcation," I
interrupted tha reporter.
"Yea; indeed i'. is an event entirely I
worthy of oar expression of joy. Oar|
firm," conlinuod Mr. Smith, "shipped the
first car over tbo now road. That was on
the 18th of November, Thoy had jost
tiaiebed the switch at our establishment,
aud the main line was but a fow feet 1
ahead when they unloaded a car of rails.
After unloading it they told us we could |
ugo it if we wanted to." Well, we couldn't
fill that car too quick. Sinco that time
we havo shipped auventy car loads."
Thia goes to show what the traffic of the I
road will ba aftor it is thoroughly ballasted,
and completely equipped. With j
sixteen fire brick and sewor pipe establishments
to oSor it froight it cannot ba
doubted but that it will eventually becomo
one of the busiest thoroughfares in tho j
country. It will also be of no mean intereat
to Whoeling, aa the peoplo who have
dealt elaowbere will certainly take aome
I pride in patronizing the metropolis of the
I State, and placing tho Nail Oity in closer
relatione with the hithorto almost inaccessible
portion of the Panhandle.
new Cumberland's industries.
It is not stating anything new when it
is said that New Cumberland is renowned
for the manufacture of fire brick and
sewer pipe, but from thia statement of
bare facta one has no adequato conception
of tho extensivonues of the industry. The
reporter through the courtesy of Mr.
Howard Bmith, son ol ono of the proprie-1
tors, waa shown through tho large plant
of McMahon, Porter & Co., and waa Btir-1
prised at the many things he had heard of
but had nover seen. Baaides having the
advantage of a superior clay the brick
manufactories 'possess another advantage !
in the cheap fuel of natural gas. All these
things with the new railroad will allow
thorn to reach the markets of the country
and compote more favorably with other
establishments of like?nature than has
