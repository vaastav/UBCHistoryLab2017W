'tiift Cotton- ciiop report,
.
.'The bill to be introduced in congress
by Congressman Webb, of the Char
lotte district, requiring dailjr publi
cation "of cotton pinners imports is
attracting a jhkI deal of attention. We
should think such provision would be
greatly preferred by all persdiis inter
ested in' the cotton market, except
Tspectiiators in futures, to the present J
manner of reijortintr estimates. A
monthly report puts the market too
much- in the hands of the cotton
gamblers, ;ni is shown on the ex
changes every .rei6rt day. It is claim
ed for the Webb bill that It will steady
the market and put a tp 4o the vio
lent fluctuations which alwitys follow
the agricultural dej:irijneu.t"s monthly'
renorts.
. A- -iiu ruber' of otton men oT "liar-f
Iotte have been interviewivJ by The
Observer asv to tiie merits of that bill.
The account of the interviews says
Ihat. some --believed tlie new arrange-,
-inent would 'work better than the one
In' force, but the greater number favor
edthe alKdishment of the reijwt alto

A RE3IARKAUIjE VERDICT.
The verdict rendered by the jar' or
the federal court in Greensboro In the
Nick Williams indictment Is causingl
comment In the press. The Nick Wil
liams Company is -a corporation. N.
Glenn Williams arid ED. Kennedy are
its principal officers. They and the.
company were charged In a bill ecn-j
talnln? fifteen counts with defrauding
the government. Ten of the counts
were withdrawn and the jury passed
upon the other five. The jury return
ed not guilty as to all the defendants
on four of these- counts and on the
fifth It found that the corporation was
gnilty of defrauding tho government;
but that the individual defendants
were not guilty.
The trauds.if committed, were neces
sarily the work of some person con
nected with the company. The cor
poration, having no personality, cxila
not commit sltl actual crime. Any
wrongful act done In its name or in
the course of -the transaction of Its
i
business, must necessarily have boen
the work of &cme individual connect
ed with that corporation. Hence we-
cannot see Tiow there could be a vio
lation of a criminal statute by this eor-l
poration without some one of its jzrsm
hers or officers being guilty of having'
done the forbidden deed.
Under the finding of this jury ta
bank official might steal all the funds
-deposited with the bank by its custom
-rs anrl on an indictment including the
corporation with the guilty official for
criminal mismanagement and embes
zlement. the jury might find the in
dividual not guilty and still declare
the corporation ;guilty. This woulJ
'hardly be a .greater straining of the
law than was hat resorted to by the
jury in the .Nick '.Williams case.
-The Norfolk Landmark in discussing
the Nick Williams verdict says that
lit was the "".natural , consequence of the
:peniicious .precedent established by
-the President" in preventing the pros
cution of Paul Morton for violation
of the law against discrimination in
;rwiLway freight rates when vice pres-
:Fe railrdrtd. II will be remembered
:that Mr. Roosevelt . held in substaaa.ee
that "here was no : evidence that the
railway rate .law was violated, by Mr.
Morton butonly by the corpora tion of
which he was general manager.
Of
says:
these two cases the Landmark
This makes it impossible to do any-;
thins: more than fine ihe corporation1
o,000 and the costs Of the action. The
Sawyers for the defence jnade the point
immediately after the verdict was ren
dered, that a corporation, being: im
personal, could not 'have intent, ami
that therefore the judgment of crime
asrainutt the Oha 'Nick Company is null
contention, bwt from the lay -point ofj
view there is a great deal of sound
ense in the argument that it is im-l
possible for a corporation to be eruiltyj
while all its officers are innocent. How
ever, ff the president was right in the
iMorton case, the Greensboro .iury is
rfcrht in the Nick Williams -case : and if!
that is so. the big corporations will go
atvead violating the taws while thev
la,js:h m their sleeves -at-the Jittle fines
assessed against them after tedious
and cost- prosecution by tho govern
ment. THAT RAILWAY KXTE ?iANK.
In Tuesday morning-s .News and
Observer we find the following in the
editonnl department, lieferepce of
coui-se is to the matter of federal con
trol of interstate railway rates-
The railroad organs are greatly dis
appointed because Mr. John Sharpe
Williams didn't iump off the -demo
cratic platform because Mr. Roosevelt'
determined to stand for its soundest
plank. Mr. Williams doesn't leave
, own home because another -asks
kave to warrt hv his fire and brings
some wood to help make it
rightly.
In The Evening Times of Itiale&h
i the same day we find the following
-paragraph in an editorial comment on
president IJocisevelts message to con-'
,gl?ss:
-The rate bill w&s hatched in the cor-H
runt republican breast. It is a republi
can measure, a hair-splitting roject
terribly exaggerated until there are
people who believe that the railroads
have been sucking Uie very life bipod
of the shippers. Its. enactment into a
a law will not increase the size of thej
loaf. It will not give more meat to
the hungry, and it will help none of us
for that tariff robbery is the law that
takes bread from starving American
citizens. ' If the bill ever passes it will
be with the aid of democratic votes
democrats will help to make Theodore
.Roosevelt the mighty dictator. Just as
Tner w. 1 lurn tne government over tO(
i t-.i'.uuuvauM i.r an ume. uniess. uer
traps, the thing' shall react and rebotmdj
aaid crush the party which bas fought
for it. Its passage will mean that
Theodore Roosevelt will be the next
president of the United States by the!
grace of democratic votes, or that he
will be the mest unpopular statesman
on American soil.
When such geod and ably edited
democratic papers as these differ so
widely and so emphatically what
must the ordinary man in the
ranks do who looks to these pa
pers for guidance? How can he
form an opinion as to what his party
should do? He mut be in doubt
whether this railway rate contest,
which was advocated by his party
long before adopted by the republi
cans, has become a corrupt matter, not
lit any longer to be touched by a demo
crat since Mr. Rooseveit has endorsed
the proposition, or whether he shall
eontinuo to stand on this plank of
his platform considering it as'sound as
ever notwithstanding the fact that the
republican president is try ing to climb
upoBlt. 'r- ' ; :
For ourselves, we cannot see why
it i not as good democratic doctrine
since the delivery of the president's
message as it was on the day it vras
promulgated in a democratic national
convention as one' of the principles of
that party. Wonder what Mr. Jose
phus Daniels, and Mr. John Sharp
Williams have to say about this prin
ciple being "hatched in the corrupt
republican breast."
RUSSIA'S FEARFUL, CONDITION'.
The news from R-isIa becomes
more alarming day jt day. While
there is not ih5? same desperate riot
ing in the strears of :he two capitals,
that occurred a while back, there
seems to be a more determined move
ment on the part of the people to
th-'W off the yoke of opressiom In
fact the changed demeanor of ihe
iDa.:.ses seems to cau the offic.ilr
greyer anxietj-. The la'ier are in it?
darn. They do not kn-w what to ex
Pk'" next. "Thev know :hcy are stand
ing over a smouldering mine, which
may explode at any moment, but icey
Ocannot tell where the outbreak will
take nlace. It seems to be a mee
question of time as to when the uni
verbal revolution will break out. That
ir. wlil come can not well be doubted.
There must be much truth in the re
' peated reports as to the conditions in
the c?ties and throughout the prov
inces. Anarchy reigns in many sec--tioL-s
of the rural districts and in the
cities only a show otgreat military
: strength prevents the same condi
tions arising. There are rumors of
he czar being attacked and wounded
in His palace; of his making prepaa
tjpm; for.-, secret fAght beyond the
ii'ti'ers of his empire: of organised
rr-volutiomuy governments in the
, pro'-Jrces; ml ite better class, of cit
izens in the rural districts fleeing by
hundreds into iermanv to escape tL'i
. roving bands of marauders and mur
derers. Day by day the condiMcn
Srcw worse and there is m hope
heh' out of any change fo: iiir.tedpr
or of any power able to stent th-2 tid
.of i evolution and jts following reigt
of t t ir or.

the new mill of Captain Tom Dixon,

of Pollock street. New Bern Journal.
This is not the gentleman who wrote
"The Leopard's Spots," and "The

ocular demonstration of. the direful
Jiappenings to come if they do not take
His .'advice and immediately colonize
oru .some ; desert spot or transport to

who, has turned Ms. talents, though not
so brilliant, perhaps, as those of the
oilier, to better purposes and put them I
i-o a use more likely, to be of' benefit
to his neighbors, though the venture
will not put so many idollars in his
pmiket.
