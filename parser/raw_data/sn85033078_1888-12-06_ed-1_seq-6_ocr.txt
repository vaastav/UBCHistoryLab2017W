The total values of the expoits of mer
chandise from the United States during
the twelve months ended Oct. 31, 1888, as
compared with similar exports daring
the corresponding period of 1887, were:

Eloeh Smith, who heads a Mormon
colony in Alabama, says that the church
has 40 mission stations in Alabama and
Tennessee and 10,000 converts are made
by them annually. The elder is on his

many of them mere girls recruited as
victims to polygamy.
By the report of the United States
treasurer, it will be seen that the surplus
taxation of the people for the fiscal year
of 1888 reached the great total of slll,-
341,273, while the treasury balance was
increased from $69,000,000 to $129,000,-
300. This is the accumulation, somewhat
reduced at present by large purchases of
bends, bat growing greater every day,
that threatens business and weighs upon
every commercial interest and the whole
people of the country, besides inviting
demoralizing schemes of expenditure and
loose notions of finance. The treasurer
considers it useless to continue coining
silver dollars, as the country is already
satiated with them, and there are plenty
loft in the treasury vaults to meet any
demand. So he recommends that certi
ficates bo issued based upon bullion
deposits.
A oosvtioh of cattle-men and a com
mittee of the United States senators have
S>een trying to discover at St. Louis why
it is that in the last few years the
prices for cattle have been declining,
while at the same time the cost of dress
ed b&ef to consumers has been increas
ing. Nobody cares especially whether
Bt. Louis or Chicago is the beef center
of tho nation, or whether Chicago stole
away from St. Louis the butchering
supremacy, but it is a matter of consider
able importance to know whether the con
centration of the dreasrd beef business
ut onivago and tho anomaly of low-priced
cattle and high-priced beef is due to a
ring of four or five firms, as is charged,
that has been built up by means of dis "
criminating railroad advantages and
otner unlawful practices. It is certain
that the natural laws of competition! do
not rule this business, and that the peo
ple have not been getting tho advantages
accruing from declining prices of cattle.
A little more light is called for on this
enbject.
FROM WRETCHEDNESS TO THRIFT.
The rich people of Manchester, Eng
land, have adopted a plan for the amelio
ration of the Irish which, beyond all
question, is as generous as it is practical,
A year ago, a correspondent of the Man
chester Guardian who was traveling in
Conemaia, favv in the sea coast hamlet of
Carna the lowest siege of misery and
'catitution that he bad met in the course
his wanderings. He sent to his paper
a letter containing a touching appeal in
behalf of the wretched inhabitants of the
place. This appeal did not fall on barren
ground. The Manchester capitalists
raised a considerable sum of money.
Instead of spending it in charity they
planted industries in the place. A mar
ket for the goods manufactured was
created in Manchester. The men, women
and children found employment in these
industries. The girls were taught how to
knit and how to weave, and now have
constant work in making caps, stockings
and underwear. Boats were provided
for the men who preferred to follow the
oocupation of fishermen. These have
established h thriving trade in potted
fish and lobsters and smoked fish m the
Ijiverpool market. Roads are being con
structed, and numbers of men have found
employment in that public improve
msnt. All this was done one year ago
and in that short time the aspect of the
place has completely changed. Fron a
dirty, squalid, unhappy place it has been
changed into a happy and thrifty village.
There is no trace of the past Carna to be
see* in the Carna of to-day. The exhi
bition of a spirit of like benevolence and
fraternal feeling toward the Emerald Isle
by the people of England would be the
surest solution of the present complex
political problem. If the economical
question in Ireland were properly ad
justed the political question would not
long remain unsettled. If by outside
help the Irish people could become skill
ed in the industrial arts they would soon
become prosperous. The Irish people
are industrious and quick to learn. And
they world not allow practical philan
thropy of this kind to be misapplied.
They only need the chance to improve
it. Outside of Ulster county agriculture
is the mainstay. It is at best, a weak
mainsiay. The planting of industries by
English capital would bo the surest as
well as the quickest method of transform
ing the social aspect of the Irish nation.
There is not the money in Ireland to
build an industrial system. The capital
must come from other places. In the
oonr'e pursued by tho benovelent people
®f Manchester may be found an example
worthy of emulation.

ANOTHER TERRIBLE WRECK,

Cohassett, Mass. —lt is reported

that che steamer was sunk on some of the
ledges directly outside of this port. At
about two p. m. Sunday a number of
people at the village heard the sound of
a steamer’s whistle and Tuesday night an
immense amount, of drift wreckage
came ashore at St.ndy Cove,
and on Sandy Beach, mark;,
upon which indicated conclusively that
the wrecked vessel must have been the

some other wreckage was stamped with

THE SOCIALISTS.
They are Determined to Make Their Strength
Feltiin the Coming Election.
Beblin. —The socialist electoral man
ifesto predicts a struggle in the com
ing election of unusual vehemence. It
reminds the electors that the reichsteg
will be elected, not for three years as
heretofore but for five, and says that by
virtue of the resolution of the St. Gall
congress the socialist candidates should
be nominated in every district where
there are any adherents of the party,
even if the chance of election be remote,
in order to show the number of socialists
in the empire. The socialistic manifesto
further says they are hopeful that the
electorate is coming to its senses,
and will not again be scared by
the war phantom evoked in 1887.
The manifesto heralds greater activity
in socialistic agitation while the reichs
tag proceedings discourage police inter
ference. This was seen in the marvelous
toleration accorded to the socialist work
men’s demonstration last evening when a
large number of workmen after a meet
ing formed a procession and paraded the
streets singing the “Marseillaise.” The
recent newspaper war has disclosed an
intense Austro Hungarian jealousy of the
German supremacy.

A recent subject of debate at a young

was: “Is Life Worth Living Without
Gossip?” Th3 girls of the school, after
a heated argument, decided unanimously
in the negative. Mrs. Gladstone, ad

the Education of Girls, in Wales, upheld
this decision. The Spectator defends
Mrs. Gladstone on the ground that “easy
conversation, sprinkled with allusions to
persons, jet not confined to personalities,
is one of the intellectual enjoyments
possible only to those who live under and
share in a developed civilization.”
The national executive committee of

CONGRESSIONAL
Monday, Deo. S.
House —Long before the hoar for the
meeting of the second session of the 50th !
congress the galleries of the house were .
fllleC with spectators, and the bright dress
es of the ladies formed a brilliant frame i
to the picture presented on the floor below.
There hand shaking was indulged in and j
congratulations on re-election or condol
ences in defeat were exchanged amont
the members, jocose raillery on the part j
of the republicans and patient resigna
tion on the part of the democrats being |
everywhere evident. The republican
members who are prominently mentioned
in connection with the speakership of
the 51at congress, came in for an extra ;
share of felicitations, it being generally '
conceded on the floor that the next house j
will be republican with from 3to 7 ma- |
jority. At precisely 12 o’clock the fall of i
ihe gavel settled the tumult which ex
istcd in the hall, and silence reigned,
while Dr. Milbaru, the chaplain, offered
prajer. The roll of members was then
called, and the hum of conversation broke
cut afresh. Daring the progress of the
call Mr. Cleveland entered the executive
gallery and became an attractive specta
tor. The call developed the presence of
336 members, there being 88 absentees.
On motion of Mr. Mills (Texas,) a reso
lution was adopted directing the clerk
to inform the senate that a quorum of
the house had appeared, and that the
house was ready to proceed to business.
In accordance with the resolution the
speaker appointed'Messrs. Holman (Ind.),
Turner (Ga.), and O'Neill (Pa.) as a com
mittee to join a similar committee to
wait upon the president and inform him
that congress was ready to receive any
communication that he might desire to
transmit. The house then, at 12:30, took
a recess for an hour. After the recess
Mr. Holman announced that the com
mittee appointed to wait upon the presi
dent had performed its duty, and that the
president would communicate with con
gress forthwith. The president’s annual
message was then read by the clerk. The
portion of the message in which the
president treats of the tariff question was
listened to attentively by the members
on both sides of the house. Now and
then a smile more of triumph than of
derision would appear on the face of an
enthusiastic republican, but the silence
was not broken until the clerk read, “the
cause for which the battle is waged is
comprised within lines clearly and dis
tinctly defined. It should never be
compromised. It is the people’s cause.”
Then the could no longer re
tain their feelings and broke into a round
of applause, which wan answered by the
derisive laughter. The
president’s reference to -he Sackville-
West incident provoked laughter from
the republican side of the house, but no
demonstration was made by the demo
crats. From this point interest in the
message slackened. Mr. Mills was the
only member who paid the slightest at
tention to its further reading, and the
noise of conversation was so g-eat that
this was no easy task. When, at 3:15 p.
m., th reading was completed, Mr. Mills
offered a resolution, which was agreed to,
referring the message to the committee
of the whole and providing for its print
ing. Adjourned.
Monday, Dec. S.
Senate. —It was an unusually full sen
ate that responded to President Ingalls’
call to order at 12 o’clock to-day. At
that time the public galleries were crowd
ed. The desk of the presiding officer
was decorated by a very handsome pyra
mid boquet. Exactly at 12 o’clock Sen.
Ingalls called the senate to order, and
Chaplain Butler opened the proceed
ings with prayer. He returned
thanks for the bountiful blessings
vouchsaved the land in its material
interests, and remembered Presi
dent-elect Harrison in • his petition.
A few minutes were spent in greeting
senators, and then Senator Sherman of
fered the usual resolutions, that the sec
retary notify the house that the senate is
ready to proceed to business. A resolu
tion was offered by Sen. Morrill for the
appointment of a committee to notify the
president that the senate is ready to re
ceive any communication he may have to
make. Senators Morrill and Salisbury
composed this committee. Sen. Cameron
offered a resolution that the senate meet
each day until farther ordered at 12
o’clock, which resolution was adopted.
At 12:47 on motion of Mr. Sherman,
the senate took a recess for half an hour.
At the conclusion of the recess, which
had been extended to 1:30, the usual
message from the house, announcing the
facts of its being in session and of its
having appointed a committee to wait up
on the president was delivered. That was
followed by a report from the committee
to wait on the president to the effest that
it had performed vhaf. duty and that the
president would communicate in writing
immediately. The president’s message
was then delivered, and Mr. McCook, sec
retary of the senate, proceeded to read
it. The reading of the message occupied
an hour and twenty minutes. The por
tions of it which discussed the question
of tariff revision, treasury surplus, fishery
troubles and the West incident were
listened to with very close attention by
the fourteen republican senators and
about, an equal number of democrats.
Tfce other portions of the message seemed
to have but few, if any listeners, and
the reading had the effect of gradually
clearings the galleries of the numerous
spectators. When the reading was finish
ed, the message was laid on the tasle and
ordered to bo printed. The presiding
officer announced that the unfinished
business for tomorrow was the bill to re
duce taxation (the tariff bill.) Sen. Frye
gave notice that he would call up for con
sideration to morrow morning, the bill
for settlements with the Union Pacific
railroad company, and the bill was made
a special order for tomorrow. The sen
ate then adjourned, after notification by
Sen. Frye that hs would call up the
Union Pacific settlement bill to-morrow;
by Sen. Chandlar, that he would ask for
action oa his resolution to investigate
the Louisiana election of last April, and
by Sen. Allion, that he would ask the
senate to proceed with the tariff bill.

Cotopaxi.
Winter tourists who think of going
sonth to spend the frost-bitten months
should visit the Andes and go into train
ing for a walking match. A writer in the
American Magazine says:
Cotopaxi is the loftiest of active vol
canoes, but is slumbering how. The only
evidences of action are the frequent
rumblings that can be heard for 100
miles, and the cloud of smoke by day and
the pillar of fire by night, which constant
ly arise from a crater that is more than
3.000 feet beyond the reach of man.
Many have attempted to climb fhe mma
ster, but the walls are so steep and the
snow is so deep that the ascent is im
possible, even with scaling ladders.
On the southern slops of Cotopaxi is a
grea‘ rock, more than 2,000 feet high,
ca led the "Inca’s Head.” Tradition says
that it was once the summit of the vol
cano and fell on the day when
was s'ranglrd by the Spaniards. Those
who have seen Yesnvics can judge of the
graceur of Cotopaxi if they can imagine
a volcano 15,000 feet higher, spurting
flames and lava from a crest covered
with 3,000 feet of snow, with a voice that
has been heard 000 miles. And one can
judge of the grandeur of scenery on the
road to Quito if he can imagine twenty of
the highest mountains in America, three
of them active volcanoes, standing along
the road from Washington to Jiew York.

“Step in,” interrupted the weary

Real Southern Life.
The moonlight drifted brokenly
through a rift in the roof of a negro cab
in in the Hanorer slashes and fell on Ga
briel Jones’ gray-bearded face. He was
smoking and meditating. “Hannah!” he
called, presently; “Hannah!” Silence.
“Hannah! I say, Hannah!” a trifle loud
er. There was a rustling of the straw in
the bed in the corner, and a sleepy an
swer: “Huh?” “Hannah, did you put
dat watermilion I foun’ in Marse Ben
Scott’s patch, yistidy, in de cool spring?”
“Yes, I put dat watermilion in de cool
spring,” she answered deliberately, “Dat
was right.” A moment’s pause. “Han
nah, did you hang dat coat dat Mister
Hedley ’sisted on my takin’ ’hind the hay
rack, like I tole you?” “I did dat.”
“Did you seal! and pick dem chickens I
borrowed f’otn de man down on de river
road the other day ?” “Yes, I scall dem
chickens.” “Well, fry me one de fust
t’ing in de mornin’, case I’so got t’ go

leaned his grizzled head on the chair
back and snored the snore of the just,
and the bnll-frogs in the marshes echoed
it over the Chickahominy low grounds.
Significance of Numbers
Symbolism in numbers is an unmistak
ble fact; in the world’s literature and in
the customs of the world. There are
symbolic values to numbers which are of
well nigh universal acceptance; and al
though there is always a danger of be
ing misled by fanciful symbolizing in
such a realm as this, it is certainly safe
to recognize those symbolic values about
which there can hardly be a question.
Therefore three is the divine number,
not only in the Bible story, but in the
religions of Egypt and India. Apart
from any question of the Trinity, three
represents the past, the present and the
future and so stands for Him who was,
and is, and is to be. Four is the world
number. We use it thus today, when we
speak of the four quarters of the globe,
the four winds of heaven, the four ele
ments of nature. Three and four com
bined stand for the union or the connec
tion of the heavenly and the earthly;
therefore seven is the sacred number.
Ten is the measure of mere numerical
completeness as it is understood by as
when we speak of a tenfold advantage.
These obvious symbolisms shov them
selves again in various combinations in
the Bible aarritive. With dogmatism it
may be said that twelve appears to re
present the multiplying oi the world
number by the divine number; that is
symbolizes the peculiar divine provisions
of the world's needs. Thus it was that,
in the line of promised blessing, there
were twelve patriarchs, twelve tribes,
twelve apostles, twelve foundations and
gateways of the spiritual building. Thus
it is that there are ample provisions to
day in the plan of God for all the people
of God. Even beyond the peculiar pro
visions within the limits of rhe twelve,
there are the wider provisions of the
seventy—the sacred seven multiplied by
the numerically complete ten. The Jews
hold ?hat beyond the twelve tribes there
were seventy nations in the world. There
were seventy sacrifices offered for these
nations in the great week of atonement.
Seventy elders were the associates of
Moses. There were seventy members in
the Sanhedrim. Jesus sent out, not only
his twelve apostles, but also seventy
disciples, as preachers of the Gospel.
Here, again, is the idea of the fullness of
God’s provisions for the human race.
Numbers can suggest this fullness, but
numbers cannot define it.
Labor in the South.
Wilmington (N. C.) Messenger: From
New Orleans comes an authoritative state
ment that German is rapidly supplanting
colored labor in the sugar plantations of
Louisiana, a large number having with
in the past two years been put to work,
and there is urgent demand for more,
which want is to be supplied. These
white laborers are employed in the field
as well as in the manufacture of sugar,
and give great satisfaction, the estimate
being made that one white man is equal
to two colored in that particular crop.
White foreign labor is gradually supplan
ting colored labor in many localities.
The colored man is not, in all places,
holding up his end, and we are very sorry
to see it. Too many are trying to make
their livings by make shifts to avoid
work. They are too ready to imitate
lazy, thriftless white people who only
work under compulsion.
The old class of colored people, who
were taught to work under the slavery
regime, have proved the must thrifty of
the free colored people, the most industri
ous, and the best mannered. They are
the class mainly which have accumulated
property in their freedom, and they are
the most desirable colored employes.
But the class is rapidly passing away.
The old-fashioned colored men and
women, whom every Southern m'in and
woman is bound to cherish with an affec
tion peculiar to the institution of slavery,
are growing rarer every day, and in their
place comes a set sprung np since the war
who often show no appreciation of their
duties of life, and have no consideration
for or sense of politeness toward the
white people. We regret to have observed
this. No one reared in the days of slavery,
born among, inheriting, and owning
them, accustomed to their association
from early youth, and always tended and
served by them, can ever lose his interest
in the black people of the South. To
such it will ever be painful to observe
their retrogression.

AUTHOR S WIVES.
Somethin? About the Helpmaets of
Literary Men.
Should a Great Man Have Either Wife
or Children?
Eugene L. Dildier.
Balzac s v - t*Ht f. man should have
neither wir- nor ccr.i-; n; h? belongs
to the word, to il. tut f wife a.id family,
and shrn'd tr-ad alone ihe pa ? h of glory,
or of sacrifice, as tae case may be. Fro--
this opinion of the greafest French novel
i*lß I beg leave to disstnr, so far as auth
ors are concerted, great or small. If
mere is a man in the woild who needs
the love and sympathy of a wife it is the
an hor. Y; t theaana’s of literature fur
nisb the melancholy fact that of all men
authors have bteu the least happy in
their domestic lives, and. if the truth
must bo told, the wives have generally!
bt-en the cause of this state of affuis. !
The story of Socrates’ domestic difficult- !
iea is too familiar to bo repeated here. '
We all know that it required much phil
osophic patience to keep the family of
which Xantippe was the mistress. We
know that Caesar’s wife was not "above sus
picion,” and Cictro’s home wife was not
the happiest, Milton sang of “Paradise
Lost,” but did no; find paradise in his
own family, although he tried persistent
ly with three successive lives. Shake -
speare, from his own bitter experience,
announced as a fact for all time that “a
young man married is a man that’s mar
ried.” Addison made a splendid match
with the dowager Countess of Warwick,
and was obliged to escape to Will’s cof
fee house from the gilded misery of Hol
land House, where my lady countess pre
sided in awful state, and lectured her
gentle husband for associating with such
low fellows as Pope, Swift, Steele, and
other wits of the golden age of Queen
Anne.
De Quincey writing of the wives and
children of literary men, says they it is
that, being man’s chief blessings, create
also for him the deadliest of his anxieties
that stuff his pillow with thorns, and sur
round his daily life with snares; and, he
adds, suppose the case of a man who has
helpless dependents of this class upon
himself, summoned to face some sudden
failure of his resources—that he should
lose the power of of exerting so delicate
an organ as the creative intellect, when
dealing with snbjecs so coy as those of
the imagination—what a maddening
thought is this to a man of family who
has absolatly noVesocroes except what his
pen yield. De Quincey himself seffered
this terrible anxiety; so did Burns, upon
whom amongst all the children of genius
ane primeval corse had fallen heaviest
tud sunk most deeply.
The wife of a literary man should be
either a plain-minded woman who should
occupy herself exclusively with house
hold matters and shield her husband’s
peace by taking those cares upon her
self or else a woman capable of entering
into his literary life. Few authors wives
have been of the latter kind. A notable
instance, however, is afforded in the wife
of Alphonse Daudet. She is an invalua
ble literary assistant to her husband.
She takes his rough, corrected manuscript
and makes a clear copy, correcting at
the same time any slight errors that may
have escaped her husband’s notice.
Daudet then takes the manuscript in
hand again for final revision and careful
polishing. Mme. Daudet afterward re
writes the whole manuscript and sends it
to the press.
Bnlwer, in the glow of youth, fell in
ove with a pretty face, and made what he
supposed was a love match. He soon
found that loves young dream was a hide
ous reality—that his hopes of married
happiness had turned like dead sea fruit,
to ashes. The pretty bride oecame the
domestic fury. A separation soon fol
lowed, but she never ceased to be a pain
ful feature of his life.
Dickens’ domestic troubles have never
been satisfactorily explained, bat he said
it was a case of incompatibility of tem
per. I think it was a case of egregious
personal vanity on the part of Charles
Dickens. The amazing success of his
works raised him far above his original
social position; he became the friend of
Lady Biessingtou, Walter Savage, Lan
dor, Tennyson, Bnlwer, aud others, whose
refined and cultivated society made him
seek for happiness abroad rather than at
home. His genius made him a peer of
the highest land, but bis wife remained
the same plain nerson who had shared
and solaced his early poverty and ob
scurity. He became a social lion, whom
princes end nobles delighted to honor;
htr duties, as the mother of nine child
ren, kept her at home, and she was thus
prevented from cultivating the graces
and acquiring the manners which would
have fitted her for the aristocratic society
in which her husband found both his
taste and his vanity gratified.
Life has been said to be a comedy to
those who think and a tragedy to ttose
who feel; surely when Byron’s life was a
profound tragedy, for of all the s ms of
maa few have felt more deeply than the
author of “Manfred.” His noble brow
was often darkened by a scowl, his cla-sic
month was often disfigured by a fimur,
but his heart, was never deaa to affection.
He never turned wi'h cold indifference
from sorrow and suffering, whether that
of a nation or that of an Individual. In
an unfortunate moment he married a
woman whose cold heart never responded
to his love, and whose mathematical mind
could not appreciate his generous enthus
iasm. In this one year of married life
he endured a lifetime of misery; and j
then, without a warning, and assigning:
no reason for her conduct, his wife left i
him, and not only refused to return, bat
would not answer his letters, and declined
to listen to his attempts to effect a recon
ciliation. She was moraly responsible for
his subsequent irregularities and early
death. It was a glorious death, and a
worthy termination of the most dazzling
literary career the world has ever known:
but Lady Byron was not the less guilty
for driving to an early grave one so gift
ed and so unhappy.
I have merely glanced at a few illus
trious literary men whose wives have not
only not contributed to their happiness,
but have been lead to their feet. On the
other hand, there are many wives of lit
erary men who are the sweet,sympathetic
cempanions of their husbands, but whose
loveliness is seldom known to the world,
because their sweetness, like the perfume
of the violet, is hidden from the sight of
men. I recall at this moment the devoted
wife of the southern poe, Paul H. Hayne.
She was not only his tender, sympathetic
companion,but when ill-health prevented
him from undergoing the physical labor
of writing, she s his evev-ready and in
telligent amanuensis, besides attending
to his personal comfort, and by htr taste
beautifying their little cottage, and mak
ing out of it an ideal home for a poet.
Colored. Men Progressing.
Rev. John id. Collett, pastor of Efaan
ezer African Methodist Episcopal Church,
preached to a large audience upon the
“Progress of the Colored People in
Amerca.” He first presented the progress
of the colored people religiously, saying
that the religions tendency of the colored
people had greatly facilitated their civil
ization. Of their advancement in affairs
of state he said: “Colored men have
filled with marked ability the positions of
Senator, Representative, United States
Marshal, Governor and Lieutenant Gov
ernor Connl to Spain. Minister to Hayti
and Liberia, Register of United States
Treasury, Register of Deeds, constables,

A 60RN T DEVIL.
He Almost Butchers an Innocent Victim and
Escapes.
Indianapolis, Deo. 3.—A desperate and
cold blooded attempt to commit mn-der
occurred early this morning in the bakery
ot James P. Bruce. About three years
ago Bruce took a poor home
less German named George Hack
er into his employ and taught
him the trade. Hacker gradually de
veloped into a full blown anarchist, and
when conversing on the subject of an
archy would grow excited and abusive.
This morning when Brnoe enteied the
bakery to mix the flour for his bread,
Hacker sprang on him armed with
a hatchet and a long knife. He
struck Bruce on the head with the
hatchet. Then he crowded the dazed vic
tim against the wall and deliberately
plunged the dagger nine times into
Bruce’s neck and face. The victim cried
out for his wife and the brave woman
rushed into the room and clutched the
blood-bespattered anarchist about the
neck, dragging him away from her hus
band just as he was lifting the hatchet to
brain the helpless man. A terrible
struggle between the fran'ic wife and the
anarchist then took place. He was
wild with murderous hate and holding
the bloody knife in his hand he
rushed about the room endeavoring to
again get at the dying Bruce. He finally
did get by the wife and reached Bruce,
when the latter, who is of giant frame,
struggled to his feet in a dying effort, and
grabbing a shovel struck Hacker a blow
on the head, and he ll*d and is still at
large. Bruce is at the hospital with slim
hopes of living through the night.
SHOT A GIRL DEAD.
A Chicago Folicemau’s.Careless Shooting—The
Burglar Escapes—An Excited Meb.
Chicago, Dec. 3.—A young woman was
shot dead on Congress street last night
by a reckless police officer. As the au
dience poured out of the People’s theater
tney were startled by the sound of five
pistol shots fired in rapid succession.
They saw men running from State street
into Congress, and the two thous
and men and women who had been
to the theater followed. Those who
were in the lead saw a man
rush across the street and through an
ally with an officer in hot pursuit. Both
the officer and the man he was pursuing
were clutching revolvers, from which
smoke was curling. They kept on run
ning and disappeared ia the darkness.
Someone descried a dark object lying on
the sidewalk on the north side of the
street and the crowd rushed toward it.
The object was a young and beauti
ful woman, dressed in black silk
and wearing a fur-trimmed jacket.
A physician picked her up and carried
her to the street lamp. The gaslight
shone down on her pretty face and the
physician descried a small hole just above
the right temple from which a stream of
blood was running. Ho placed his ear
close to her breast and listened. There
was not a sound. “She is dead,” the
physician exclaimed, and he tenderly
laid the body down on the pavement.
In in instant a mob of 3,000 frantic per
sons, filling the street from curb to curb,
crowded forward, and those in front had
to turn and fight the crowd back to keep
the body of the girl from being stamp
ed upon. Patrol wagons arrived, cleared
the street, and carried the dead girl to
an undertaker’s. The girl was identified
as Mattie Olsen, a servant in the employ
of Z. R. Winslow, of No. 11 Congress
street.
The shots were fired by Officer Eason.
The man pursued by the policeman was
attempting to break into a store.
