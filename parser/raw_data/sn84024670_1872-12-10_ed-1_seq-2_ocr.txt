An effort was mado at tho last session of
f'ongrc. s to grant a mail subsidy in aid of
the new line of steamers now plying be
tween San Francisco, New Zealand and
Australia, but without success, though im
portant aid had been rendered by similar
subsidies granted by tho two British colo
nies thus connected by stc.im. rs with tho
great commercial metropolis of America
on tlie Pacific. The chief objection urged
against granting this mail subsidy ot the
lime tho bill was before Congress, was that
the lino was an individual enterprise, and
0* course entirely dependent upon tho
•kill, capital and energy of ono man,
Whereas a company, properly chartered
a id organized, would be permanent in its
nature, aud more likely to meet the grow
ing demands of commerce in that quarter
of the Republic.
This objection' has now been overcome,
ths property and business of the line hav
ing passed into the hands of a corporation
organized in New York Stato, called the
United States, New Zealand and Australia
Steamship Company, of which Mr. Webb
ia president, the directors including the
Mayor of San Francisco, president and
cashier of the Bank of California, and Iho
president of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company. All the steamers iiud mail con
tracts of the Webb line havo passed into
tho hands of this company.
The many important advantages accru
ing to our government from the establish
ment of this line of Pacific steamers, will
strongly commend it to the benefit of this
Subsidy, when tho matter is again pressed
upon tho uttentiou of Congress. It is upon
the Pacific that we most easily make head
way in the rebuilding of our tuarilime in
terests as against the commercial advan
tages of England, and the fact that both
the New Zealand nnd Australian colonies
have e_lundt.d aid lo this lino in individual
hands, will strongly impress the American
miud iv favor of the subsidy asked. Tho
question is of vastly more importance to
us now, since tho Pacific railroitd, in
connection wilh this line ol steamers, gives
its au immense advantage over any
European government iv reaching tho
commerce of those distant regions. Tho
success of the Pacific mail steamship line
to Japan has demonstrated the advantages
we possess for maintaining our ascen
dency of the ocean trado of the
Pacific. Before that lino was estab
lished England held a complete supre
macy in the commerco of Japan, by her
promptitude in having her steamers on
thoso seas. But our line has completely
reversed the situation, so that American
commerce with Japan now exceeds that of
all other nations. Since the line to Aus
tralia and New Zealand was established
our trade with thoso countries has largely
increased. What is now needed is that
the permanence and regular running of the
liuo should be assured by a mail subsidy.
.So the friend, of this great enterprise
assert, and there seems to bo great plausi
bility in their argument.
The policy of the government has been
.gainst the granting of subsidies to Atlantio
steamship lines, but our ascendency in the
Pacific is geuerally accepted as a matter of
tbe first importance by our statesmen
and public writers, and it is for th a
r.ason, and the fact that this newly
organized company is now competing
with one of the greatest of all the
British steamship iut .rests—the Peninsular
and Oriental Steamship Company—that tlie
subsidy will bo more favorably considered
by Congress. Before the establishment of
this line, and that from San Francisco to
Japan, Great Britain completely monopo
lized the commerce of China, Japan, tho
East India islands, and the Indian petiin
snla.
The Whig complains of tho unexpected
turn that affairs have taken in Now Or
leans, iv regard to the political muddle
which disgraces Louisiana, as similar ones
do Alabama and Arkansas. We presume
our neighbor has no sympathy with the
Warmoth faction in that Stßte, nor with
the high-handed proceedings by which they
have sought to retain their power. As we
look upon the controversy, Warmoth's
audacious usurpations are only paralleled
by tho weakness of a people, once full of
spirit and energy, who could tamely sub
mit to them as the Louisianians have. His
List despotic a.t seems to have capped the
climax, and tha best people of all paitijs
in tlie State seem to have united in the
summary steps that were taken for his ex
pulsion from the position he had notorious
ly usurped.
As the matter stands, Warmoth has
been defeated by the court in his effort to
control tho Legislature, and tho decision of
tho court is sustained by General Emory
and the business interests rf the city, as
well as tho cool judgment of the State.
The result is that the elcctiou will be prop
erly declared, and tho rightful legislature
seated. If the people cf New Orleans
would manifest n loyal and proper spirit,
and consult their own interests by main
tabling the laws ruthcr tl.nn jeapordizing
them by jumping at every chanco to in
crea-o trouble, this Warraolh imbroglio
would never havo originated.
The nusstio- of the valid!., ef
his acts wag brought before tbo Cir
cuit Court of tho United State..
Wo tlo not assume to docidc on the tech
nical regularity of Judgo Durell _ proceed
ings. If he has transcended his powers,
tne judicial system opens tho way for a
correction cf the error. The Court has
simply ovoruled the high-handed measures
of Warmoth on a case properly presented
to its consideration, and tho part which
General Emory has had to perform, in en
forcing tho decrees of a federal court, has
been an extremely difficult and delicate
one. Ilia course seems to have been
marked by great temperance and
judgment, and no serious disturbance
of tho peace has been provoked.
It is difficult to exaggerate the evil.
which this man Warmoth, whose career is
pow near its close, has brought on tho un
fortunate State he has so long ruled. Loui
siana, under him, has not only been plun
dered, but it has been oppressed. Lite and
property have been rendered insecure in
many parts of tho Stato, and particularly
so in tho capital, whero his infltienco has
been most felt.
The fact that the Electoral College of
Louisiana failed to cast its vote for Presi
dent and Vico-I'resident on Wednesday
last, is urged as an additional reason for
tho abolition of tho Eloctoral College sys
tem. One State is thus left practically
without a voico in the Presidential election,
as the voto of the Electoral College would
be a nullity, if cast on any other day. The
consequencos would have been of tho most
serious character if the result of the elec
tion had depended upon tho vote of that
particular State. It seems that there is
no law providing for tho removal of a
President in the event of his becoming in
sane, and in case of insanity in a President
the country would bo in the samo condition
as England in the time of Oeorge 111. It
is suggested that some remedies should be
provided for these defects in our political
system, and that there should be some law
ful means found for testing the validity of a
Presidential election. At present the only
remedy against fraud is a recourse to arms.
The Tribune thinks it is unfortunate
that some of the sensitive and high-spirited
Boston newspapers protested against their
sufferers by the flre being tho recipients of
outside aid. The protest chilled somewhat
the generous impulses of tho whole coun
try ; none felt like offering relief which
might bo considerod obtrusive. But now
the Central Committee of Relief are obliged
to say that they need $100,000 for imme
diate necesgitieß. To be sure, no appeal
is made to other cities, but tho committee
pointedly intimate that such a course may
yet bo necessary, unless the people of Bos
ton respond liberally. It would have
hurt tho dignity of Boston Bomowhat to re
ceive the proffered gifts ; but it would have
dono much good to those who wanted to
dispense their generosity.
The now Jefferson school, at Washing
ton, was dedicated on (Saturday. B. O.
Korthrop, Esq., Secretary ot the Connecti
cut Board of Education, delivered the
principal address, strongly condemning the
fashion of sending American boys to for
eign schools. Prof. Tyndall followed and
approved Mr. Northrop's warning against
this practice. Mr. Mori, Japanese Minis
ter, also made an address, and said the now
educational system of Japan embraces
eight colleges, 256 high schools and over
53,000 public schools, with compulsory at
tendance of all children over six years.
Ja >an is doing better than many of the
American States.
IT is said that a bill will soon be offered
in 'he House of Representatives for a re
mission of duties ou goods imported by
Boston merchants and destroyed in the
great fire. Tho bill will be similar to tho
one passed in 1838 for the relief of mer
chants who suffered in the New Tork flre
of 1535. Its principal feature is tho i__u
ing of certificates to tho morchants who
lost goods for tho amount of duties paid,
which are to bo recorved by the Govern
ment as payment for duties on goods to bo
imported in tho future.
The arguments in the case of the great
New Jorsey railroad suit were commenced
last Thursday, and are likely to occupy the
whole of this week. Thus far Chancellor
Williamson, for the complainants, and At
torney General Gilchrist, for the defend
ants, are the only counsel who have been
heard. Other lawyers of eminence are to
follow in the argument, and the case will
hardly be submitted beforo Friday or Sat
urday.
Senator Ferry, of Connecticut, has
introduced a bill in Congross to repeal the
iron-clad oath, but it does not remove that
oath from the Public Land laws. It is
now required in preemption and homestead
entries, nnd serves but poorly any just pur
pose, and protects no interest of the gov
ernment. It is simply an indirect pun
ishment for persons who have been relieved
of every other disability. Mr. Beck, of
Kentucky, it is understood, is preparing a
bill which will strike this oath from the
Land laws.
Senator Sumner is said to be ongaged
in preparing a speech in support of his res
olution proposing to erase the names of the
battles of tho civil war from the Army
Register and regimental flags, so as to ob
literate mtmories of the past conflicts bo
t.veen the North and tho South. lie says
t i.-ii all history shows that no country has
anything to gain by perpetuating tho recol
lections of its civil strifes or the memorios
of conflicts between its own citizens.
The Indians aro allowed free rides on
all the freight trains near their homes on
tho Central Paciflo road, tho privilege being
granted to secure their good will. They
consider themselves to be the only persons
entitled to " dead head" rides, and keep a
sharp look out for white men who try to
evade payment of fare.
The Stato Department has not matured
any proposition looking to the distribution
of the Geneva award among the individual
claimants, beyond tbe suggestions of the
