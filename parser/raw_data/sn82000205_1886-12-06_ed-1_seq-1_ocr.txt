accumulation of revenue will result In a
state of affairs demanding an effcctlvo
remedy unless every business Interest ij to
bu allowed to suffer In conscqucnco of tho

evil ono sure to grow and becomo moro

of silver coinage aro repeated, and It Is Inti

Tim FISIIUUIKS QUESTION'S.
The fisheries nuosllons have heen thu
cause of continued dispute aud nogotla
lion. Tho recommendations of tha last
Jlessngo having heen rejected by the
Senate, tho Administration proceeded
to negotiate a convention defining the
rights of tho llshcrmen of tho United
States and Canada under the treaty of
1818. No satisfactory conclusion has
been reached, but there Is sorao reason
to bcllcvo that such result may lie
achieved before Congress adjourns.
The Administration fully recoguhos
llio Importance of continuing friendly
relations with Canada, but such wore
tho actions towurd certain of our fish
lug vessels thut at times their suspeu
slon has been seriously threatened.
TUB HAWAIIAN TUBATV.

cultivate mutually beneficial commercial re

extradition should bo revised.
inteiinational coprnioriT.
International copyright legislation Is
recommended. Tha reorganization of tho
consular scrvlco and readjustment of sala

SIMPLIPYINQ ItEVENUB COLLECTION.
In reference to tho report of tho Secretary
of tho Treasury, attention Is specially called
to tho necessity for a simplification and
amendment of tho laws relating to the col
lection of rovenuo. Tho cost of collection
of revenue was materially smaller thau dur
ing tho previous year.
USNECE3SA11Y TAXATION.
Tho rovenues of tho Government exceed
Its needs, and legislative action Is demanded
to relieve tho people from tho unnecessary
burden of taxation. After tho extinguish
ment of the : per cent, indebtedness tho lu
conio of tho Government will bu far In ex
cess of Its needs without any debt upon
which It can bo expended. The result will
bu either an Injmlous and burdeusomo sur
plus or tho corrupting and evil tendencies
of extravagaut iippioprlatlous. Tho worst
phase of this surplus Is Its oxactton through
u perversion of the relations between thu
peoplo and their Government and a do
jmituro from truo principles of taxation.
Tho exaction of unnecessary taxes Is ruth
less extol Hon and violation of fuudu
mmtal principles of free government,
'the impression la becoming moro and moro
general tbat the Indirect method by which
our revenues aro derived have a tondeney to
confer exceptional business profits upou
some classes without corresponding benefits
to tho people ut large, tho accumulation of
vast foituncs rather thau tho ad.'auceiiR-nt
of popular welfare. Our farmers also realize
that tho revenue laws Imposo uuueceisary
taxes upou what they must buy and Inter
fere with tho foreign markets of what thoy
wish lo sell. Tho peoplo should not no, v
bear tho burden of taxation necessary to
carry on a great war.
fltOTECTINO HOME INI1USTI1IE3.
No chango lu tho policy of collecting rev
enue principally upon Imports Is deslrablo,
but tho people demand that tho revenues
of tho Government shall bo reduced to tho
oxpenso of Its administration, aud this do
in and should bo obeyed. Tho readjustment
of rovenuo should to such as to cause no
destructlvo chango affecting any industry,
aud should reduce tho expense of living,
whllo not curtailing tho opportunity for
work nor reducing thu compensation of
labor. Thero should bo such amendment
of tho rovenuo laws as to cheapen thu pilco
of tho necessaries of life und glvo freer en

Tbo operations of tho Pension Hurcau

Tho concluding poitlon' of tho Mossagc,
bearing upon civil scrvlco reform, the
Frccdtncn's Hank and District of Columbia
affairs, is as follows:
CIVIL-SEltVICE IIEFOI1.M.
'Tho continued operation of tbo law re
luting to our clvil-servlco has added the
most convincing proofs of Its necessity and
usefulness. It Is a fact worthy of uotu that
every public officer who has n Just Idea of
bis duty to tbo people, testifier to thu
value of this reform. Its stauuehest
friends aro found among those who under
stand It best, and Its warmest supporters
aro thoso who are restrained an 1 pintected
by Its requirements. Tho meaning of such
restraint and proteetlou Is not appreciated
by thoso who want places under tho Gov
ernment, regardless of merit and efficiency,
nor by thosu who Insist that thu selection
for such places should rest upou a proper
credential showing active partisan work.
They mean to publlu officers, If not their
lives, thu only opportunity afforded them
to attend to publlu business, uud they
mean to tho cood peoplo of tho country
tho better performance of tho work of
their Government.
THE HEt'OHM NOT UNDEUST0OD.
"It Is exceedingly strnngo that tho scope
and nature of this reform aro so llttlo tin
dcictood, aud that so many thlugs not In
cluded within Its plan aro called by Its
name. Whon cavil yields moro fully to ex
amination the system will havo largo addi
tions to tho number of its frleuds. Our
clvil-servlco reform may bo Impcrtcct iu
6onic of Itsdvtalls; it may bo misunderstood
and opposed; It may not always be faith
fully applied; Its designs may sometimes
mlccarry through mlstako or willful Intent;
It may sometimes tremble under tho as
saults of Its enemies or languish under the
misguided zeal of Impracticable filends;
but it thu peoplo nf this country over sub
mit to thu banishment of Its underlying
principle from thu operation of tholr Gov

"Tho control of tbo affairs of thu District

mend their consideration.
A CODE NEEDED.
"Tho laws of tho District appear to bo In
an uuccrtolu and unsatisfactory condition,
and tbclr codification or revision li much
needed.
"Duilug 1 lie past year ono of thnbrld-cs
lending from the District to tho State of Vir

from tbo city of Washington, Is worthy of
tho attention of Congress."
J.tQUOK LAWS.
"Tho Commissioners of tho District rep
resent that tho laws regulating the sale of

be at once amended, uud that legislation
Is needed to consolidate, define, und en

POLICE ItEOULATIOXS.
"I suggest that tho Commissioners bo
