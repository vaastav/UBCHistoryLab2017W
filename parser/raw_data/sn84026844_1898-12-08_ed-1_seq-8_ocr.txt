uankino. ->
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.?The Washington
correspondent of the Journal o(
Commerce says: There was some disappointment
In Congress when It was
J found that the President had postponed
I the discussion of our future responslbll.
( j<f in PhllinnlnoR until li? should
submit the treaty of peace. There Is
oven some- doubt whether he will discuss
the subject fully even at' that
*!me. President McKlnley does not usually
cross bridges until he comes to
them, and thereby gets the benefit of all
public discussion before taking a position.
This in his purpose In regard to
the policy of tho United States In the
Philippines. He may decide to'submit
his views regarding the moral obligation
Imposed upon t^e United States In
the premises and the commercial opportunities
opening for them, which
were recently*stated in these dispatches
in his message transmitting ^he treaty
of Paris, but he may decide to wait
even longer until the treaty has made
?Ko phiiinnlnes a definite possession of
the United States.
The President looks for the ratification
of the treaty as submttcd by the
American commissioners. He has intimated
to one or two senators, however,
that It might not be fatal to ratify with
some amendments if public opinion
Seemed to justify it. The amendment
suggested was that the United States
should take the Island of Luzon only
and reduce the compensation to Spain
in corresponding proportion. The President
will stand as firmly as possible for
the ratification of the entice treaty and
t may prefer an extra session of Congress |
rather than see it fall, dui ir tne senate
should adopt such an amendment
he would submit it to the Spanish government
without considering the action
of the senate as an affront to the administration.
The recommendations of the President
regarding the reform of the currency
are very gratifying to the promoters
of the Indianapolis movement.
The President does not undertake to
outline a complete measure of currency
reform, but he declares flatly for the
three fundamental propositions of the
monetary commission, the establishment
of the gold standard by law. the
protection of the treasury from gold
raids, and the Issue oC an elastic ra;?er
fttf mnntincr business demnndn.
Representative Mitchell, of New York,
who Introduced Jn th'o last Congress ;i
bill Tor setting aside the sold reserve
for the redemption of legal tender notes
ar.d paying out the notes cnly In exchange
for oold.' expressed much gratification
that this recommendation had
been repeated by the President and
hid the approval of Secretary Gage.
Mr. Mitchell desired to pass this measure
at the last session, but yielded to
the representations of those who favored
more comprehensive legislation, and
tv.is appointed on the sub-committee
which framed the McCIeary bill because
Chairman Walker recognized the
fact that he was not wedded to any
particular measure.
It has not yet been determined by the
promoters of the currency reform movement
whether to ask consideration of
the McCIeary bill at the present session
or to bend their energies to obtain an
extra session of the new Congress In
the spring. Member? from the 0031 ana
ihe middle west have generally come
hack to Washington Impressed with the
desire of ihe business community at
home for some currency legislation.
Man? of them declare that action
should be taken if possible at the present
session. Many of these and other
members, who do not conBlder action
essential at the present session, insist
that there should be an extra session
and that the Republican party will
never have a better opportunity to prove
the sincerity of its pledges and to place
the monetary system upon a stable basis.
The prospect of legislation by means
of an extra session has been rapidly improving
since the conference between
Mr. H. H. Hanna and President McKinleir
last week. The members of
Congress who have reached Washing
("II l rum ciunt: uinuiviD( niKiiv ??v
port of the business element was felt In
saving the districts for sound money,
are generally outspoken In favor of nn
extra session. If It can be made short
and harmonious. It has been the attitude
of President McKinley and other
Republican leaders from the beginning
t'lat an extra session would be useless.
There ivas some reasonable ground for
the belief that the sound-money majority
In both houses of the new Congress
could agree upon an intelligent measure
f"r the protection of the treasury from
gold raids and the provision of an elastic
paper currency. The suggestion of
fIfri?r.il Henderson, of Iowa, that a
similar course be pursued tr> thnt which
resulted In th?" prompt action of the
, hotirn on the Dingley bill, Is attracting
'i aeai or aircnuon. j nu bu^k-i.tlon
r,r Ocner.'jl Henderson is that

Jf"- next house sot to work ut oncv to
ure biirmonv upon, a bill aftd that
they admit to their consultations member*
?,f th?* house who are likely to be
on <hc committee In the next Congres*.
It is possible thnt this plan will be
broadened>.ao us to bring Into consulatat;on
several of the house leaders who
will not.be On the bank committee. It
is believed that they can thrfsh over
the ground of a conservative measure,
which will go a rtood way a in -the direction
desired by the admirers of currency
legislation without causing any uneasiness
among the friends of th.- present
legal tender notes nor among those who
bualneaa aaad*. Tho President. Secretary

the President summoning Congress In
extra session In March. Buch an agreement
would cut the session down to
narrow limits In respect to time and
enable the sound-money majority to
put a measure on the statute books In
time to be In successful operation when
the demand .(or money arises next autumn
for movement of the crops.
The cordial promise given br President
UcKiolgr to Mr. Hanna, and quoted
by Mr. Hanna before the New York
chamber of commerce, has materially
cleared the air and given courage to
ftf locrlatatlnn tuhn tnai?n#i thnf
the old lacteal harmony In the committee
and floor might be made the excuse
Tor further postponement of action. The
President has received a variety of advice
on the subject and it is not surprising,
even to the advocates of the action,
that he has hesitated to summon
Congress in extra session, without the
certainty that the session wovjld prove

KUl?d by Explosion of a Mint.
BOSTON, Dec. 6.?Pour men1 were
killed and several seriously injured at
Fort Independence, on Castle island, In
Boston harbor to-day by the explosion
of a mine, which had been removed
from th* channel by a diver. The dead:
Sergeant Morris McGrath, Hiram
Vaughn. Private Brennan, (a diver), ?
Ryan, cltixen.
The three men. Vaughn, Brennan and
Ryan had plnced the mine on the team
and started to take It to the place where
the o^her ammunition was stored. The
road along, which , they passed waa-unumrally
smooth, having been constructed
with a view to the necessity of care
in transporting explosive material.
Suddenly, and without warning, the
mine burst. The horse and cart and the
three men wen* blown to fragments.
Sergeant McGratb was standing fully
twenty feet away. He was Instantly killed
by the concussion. His body doea
not bear a mark of any kind.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.?Advices received
in official quarters here from
United States officials in Havana, dcpict
the state of the Cuban capitol as filthy
and unsanitary In an almost inconceivable
degree. This is true especially of
the poorer quarter of the whole city, und
it is apparent that the task of cleaning
up the city, is going to be of the greatest
maimltude. Unfortunately the report*
express the belief that frost will
not come this season to relieve The situation.
An illustration of the conditions
there Is afforded by the fact quoted that

Guanabacoa now ?Quais the entire annual
death rate.

that the abandonment was not due tc
