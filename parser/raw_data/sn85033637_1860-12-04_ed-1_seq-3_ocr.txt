Just let us say tbat a nice little flea put
into our ear the other morning, makes us
think after all, tbat Hall and Pratt are just
the wery fellows who can 'beat tbe Jews" in
selling goods. We dont fell like telling any
very tough yarns on them, yet we are aatified
by thsir large run of custom, reasonable prices,
eplendid variety, and excellent quality of
goods, tbat they are the gentlemen who can
and will succeed in business. Dont take our
word barely, but just giro them a call.

Warsaw, Mon Not. 28.
- Dr Milton, a resident of this cit?, arrived in
this cit? on Saturday erening, rom Fort
Scott, whither ba bad been on business con
necied with the Land Office. He reports tbat
Montgomery iu person was encamped within
fire miles of tbat place, with 15 or 80 men.
A detachment had entered Fort Scott, and
finding that tie gorerment officers bad fled,
and the court which was to have been held
on Monday last broken up, tbej soemed to
be satisfied and did not molest tbe town in
any way whatever.
Montgomery's object (ot the present,
seems, was only to break up the court and
prevent the trail of some 30 of bis friends in
custody. He publicly declares be will now
remain to prevent the sales, which are adver
tised for the 3d of December, and also to take
possession of Vernon and Bates conntios. Iu
the meantime, Montgomery is said to be reg
ulary encamped, with large comfortable tent,
with plenty of provisions, &c.
The men seen at Ball's Mills, who were
thought to be Montomery's bands, appear to
have been a company of Government troop,
