THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE.
It is scarcely necessary at this late dny to pub
lish entire tbe annual message of the Piesident
of tho United States, delivered to Congress on
the flth inst. We can only now point to its more
prominent features and suggestions. Like all
of Mr. Lincoln'! state-papers, it is a clear, unas
suming, straight-forward and manly document,
saying neither more nor less than is necessary.
It gives a condensed statement of our national
affairs in all their foreign and domestic relations.
In the former, it clearly shows that we need have
no apprehension for the future, and intimates no
desire for any change, save in revising the treaty
with Great Britain relative to our naval arma
ment on the lakes bordering Canada, in order
that our border may be more effectually guard
ed from tho incursions of those rebels who have
made these Provinces a place of temporary ref
uge, more with the design of annoying our gov
ernment and people than becoming useful citi
zens of the Canudas.
The message is satisfactoiy in its review of our
domestic affairs, when we take into considera
tion the immense war wo are now wagii.g for
the restoration of the Union. The public debt
on the Ist of July last amounted to one billion
seven hundred and fifty thousand millions, six
hundred and ninety thousand four hundred and
eighty-nine dollars and forty-nine cents. Should
the war continue a year longer it will be increas-
Ed not more than five hundred millions. This
sum seems immense, but it is not near so great
as the national debt of some of the European
powers. The President recommends taxation to
meet the outlay, and further asks that a limited
amount of public securities be issued, to be held
by the purshaser, and not to be taxable or liable
to seizure for debt, in order that persons of limi
ted means can have the opportunity of investing
in government securities.
Tho President clearly defines his future policy
in regard to slavery. This is indeed one of the
most marked features of the document. He
considers that in the recent election the voice of
the people was for the first time heard upon the
question of the war, and he accepts that verdict
as their firm and nearly unanimous wish to
maintain the integrity of the Union—such being
the wish of not only those who voted the Union
ticket, but a large portion of those who did not,
inasmuch as no candidate ventured to seek votes
on the avowal that ho was for giving up the
Union. Therefore the President will continue
the war until the Union is restored in all its in
tegrity. He will enter into no regotiations for
peace with the leader of the insurgents, because
that leader will listen to no terms but tbe inde
pendence of the South ; but with the Southern
people, many of whom have already changed, he
is ut any time ready to negotiate, on condition
that they lay down their arms and submit to the
national authority. He recommends Congress to
completely abolish slavery by constitutional
amendment. He retracts nothing that he has
ever said or done in regard to slavery. He will
not modify the Emancipation Proeiamation—
44 nor will he ever return to bondage a human
being freed by that Proclamation," or by acts of
Congress, and if the people wish to make such
an act an executive duty, they must—he assures
them most emphatically—find somebody else to
perform it.
Such are the important points of the message.
They have our warmest approval. His firmness
has the true Jacksonian stamp, and his determi
nation to maintain the Union and crush slavery
—the cause of our disruption and our trouble —
will meet the approval and admiration of all
loyal men. Well done, Abraham !
Nelson A. Miles, Brigadier General, com
manding a portion of the force on the late recon
noisance to Stony Creek, near Richmond, has
been promoted to a Major General of Volunteers.
He is the youngest General in the service—aged
22 —and came out as Ist Lieutenant in the 22d
Mass. General Meade has also been promoted
to a Major Generalship in the regular army,
ranking next to Sherman.
Congress.—Little of interest to the general
reader transpired in Congress the past week.
The proceedings have been characterized princi
pally by a reference of bills to tho proper com
mittees, and the consideration of the rights of
certain members from Southern States to a seat.
in the House and Senate. We look for little
business being accomplished until after the hol
idays.

EDITORIAL JOTTINGS.
—There is a goodT)rospect of the passage through to*
House of the Constitutional amendment to abolish
Slavery.
—The three-cent scrip, which has occasioned so much
talk, will probably be issued next week, as nearly all
the preparations are completed.
—Positive orders have been given in the Army of th*
Potomac to prohibit the exchange of newspapers and
the holding of any intercourse whatever with tho
rebels.
—It is reported that Vallandigham is at home, and
has taken to the peaceable pursuit of the law. That
must be more agreeable than to have the law in par
suit of him.
—We have reports of a decisive battle with the In
dians not long since near Fort Lyon, in which between
400 and 500 were killed, including three prominent
chiefs. Our loss was 9 killed and 38 wounded.
—The news of the re-election of President Lincola
has reached England, and it was, of course,comment
ed upon by the entire English Press. It seems that
the unanimity of the States and the overwhelming
majority on the popular vote made a profound impres
sion in England.
—The actual election of President and Vice President
of the United States took place on Wednesday last at
the Capitols of the various states, where the elected
Electors assembled and balloted according te the pre
scribed forms. Of course the result was settled on th*
Bth of last month by th c people themselves. _
—Harding, the officer who was in charge of the prize
steamer Greyhound,and-a-lio let the Captain thereof
escape, and who subsequently married " Belle Boyd "
(who was a passenger on the captured /essel,) was cap
tured at Martinsburg, Va., on tbe 2d inst., and sent te
the Old Capitol Prison. He says his wife is in Europe,
writing a history of her adventures.
—Gen. Logan gives it as his opinion that the slow
progress of Gen. Sherman Is the very best evidence of
his entire safety and success. It was ids programme
to make frequent halts te rest his men, while detach
ments should scour the country to destroy roads,
bridges and Rebel supplies. Had he encountered any
serious opposition lie would have reached the coast
before this.
—The settlement of the accounts of the officers con
nected with the great fair lately held in the city of
New York for the benefit of the soldiers, shows tiiat it
yielded the sum of $1,180,000. The Post justly refers to
this exhibit "as scarcely less honorable to the skill,
energy, and Integrity of the gentlemen by whom its
money afiahs were managed than ft is to the charita
ble diameters of the metropolis."
—The rebel Congress has taken the case of the pirate
Florida in hand. Resolutions were adopted a few days
since denouncing iier capture as an outrage ou civili
zation, calling upon Brazil to protect Confederate
property witnit its territory, demanding the restora
tion of the vessel, and providing for the appointment
of a commissioner to that country, and also to lay the
facts bt lore European governments.
—The Navy Department has dispatches from Admi
ral Porter stating tiiat tiie Anglo-Confederate steamer
Armstrong was captured by the United .states Block
aders Cuyler and Gettysburg on the4th, while running
out of Wilmington, with four hundred and fifty bales
of cotton, sue is six hundred and fifty tuns. Admiral
Porter describes ncr as the most beautiful craft we
have yet captured. Sue is at Hampton Roads.

his gavel to prevent a further infraction oi tlie rule*
of decorum, although it was evident that he himself
shared in the declarations of the President.
