Vor eail loans were held generally

there was a Hurry ngan to a higher
level rates touching 15 per cent, when
the principal supplies had been ex?
hausted.
The substance of the Presldeut'i
message was pretty acutely foreseen
but its effect was decidedly miscalcu?
lated. The suggestion that loyal pow?
er should ho given lo penult "under
specified conditions and careful super?
vision, rate agreements clearly in the
Internst of the public" was fastened
upen as pointing in eileet to authoriza?
tion of the revival of railroad pooling.
The effect was most pronounced in the
members of the Vanderbllt group, und
this caused conjectures of a revival of

The first conference of nations bold
nt Tho Hague ia I800. being unable to
dispose of all the business before It.
recommended the consideration and
(settlement of n number of Important
questions by nuotber conference lo bo
culled subsequently and at an early
date. These questions were the follow?
ing: .ii The rights and duties of neu?
trals; (2) tie' limitation of the armed
forces on laud and *?-a and of military
hudgi is; (3) the use .if new types and
calibers of military and naval guns:
?.be Inviolability of private property nt
sett In linns of war; (5J the bombard
n ent of pons. cities and villages by na?
val force-- in October, 1001, at the in?
stance of the interparliamentary union,
l issued Invitations to all the powers
ilgnatory to The Hague convention to
?en t delegates to such a conference
and suggested that It be again held nt
The Hague.
Prom all the powers acceptance was
received, coupled in some eases with
the condition tlint we should wall until
he end of Ihe war then waging be
tweeu iJnssia and Japan. Tho emperor
of Itnsshi, immediately after the treaty
>f peace which sr. happily terminated
this war, in n note presented to the
ii . ??! lent .>n Sept. t:; took Ute Initiative
in recommending that the conference
i be now called. Tho United States gov
l eminent in response expressed Its cor?
dial acquiescence nnd staled that It
I wi ?Iii a.-i a matter of course take part
j In the new conference and endeavor to
[ further its alms. Wo assume that all
I etvi?r.ed governments will support the
movement and that tho conference is
, uovt ah assured i"act. This government
j will do everything in Its power to se
cur? the success of the conference to
the end that substantial progress may
be made nt the cause of international
p. ace. Justice ?ml good will.
Monroe Doefrtne,
There nre certain essential points
which must never I?- forgotten as re
??: rds the Monroe doctrine. In the first
p .. ?-. we must as a nation make it ev?
ident that we do not Intend lo treat it
j m my chape or way as au excuse for
. if- ;rnndizement on our part at the ex
I p.-i, of tie- republics to the south.
Hut we must make it evident that we
do not intend lu permit the Monroe doc
iriue to bo used by any nati.ui on this
continent as a shield to protect It from
the consequences of Its own misdeeds
tgainst foreign natlous. The Monroe
! ? rlne does not force ns to interfere
to prevent tho punishmcut of n port
i tave tu see that the punishment does
'; not assume the form of territorial occu
', pittlon in any shape. Tbe case i: more
. diUicnlt when :t refers to a contractual
obligation. This country would cor
{ ti inly decline to go to war to prevent a
, foreign government from collecting a
I jv i debt. On Uie other hand. it. Is
very Inadvisable to permit any foreign
power to take possession, even tempo?
rarily, of the custom houses of an
Au erlcuu republic in order to euforce
ihe payment of Its obligations, for sucb
temporary occupation might turn into
a permauo;.! occupation. The only es
euye from these alternatives may ct
any time be thai we must ourselves
undertake to bring about sonic arrange?
ment by which so much ns possible of
a .bist obligation shall be paid.
To do so Insures the defaulting re?
public from having to pay debts of au
j Improper character under duress, while
j it also insures holiest creditors of the
J .?public from being passed by in Uie
iulerest of disboucst or grasping ercd
( iiors. Moreover, for the United Stales
to take such a Position offers the only
(Kisslble way of insuring us against a
I '"lash with some foreign power. The
;i sition is therefore in the interest of
peace as well as lu the interest of jus
Santo Domingo.
! Sun to Domingo has now made an up
I ji to us. and not only every principle
I of wisdom, but every generous iusUnct
j within uu. bids us respond to the op
peal. The condiUons In Santo Domingo
I have for a number of years grown
from bad to worse until a year ago all
lOeletj was on the verge of dissolution.
Fortunately just at this lime a ruler
: prang up In Santo Domingo who. with
I his colleagues, saw the dangers threat
?ping their country nnd appealed to the
I friendship of Uie only neighbor who
I possessed the power and the will to
help them. There was Imminent dam
I "er of foreign Intervention The pa
j lence of foreign creditors had become
ixbausted, und at least two foreign na?
tions were on Ihe point of intervention
'and were only prevented by the unoffi?
cial assurance of this government that
i it Woukl Itself strive to help Santo
I Domingo In her hour of need.
Accordingly, tho exceuUvo depart
ment of our government negotiated a
treaty under which wo nre trying to
help tin- Dominican people lo straight
.?ii but their finances. This treaty Is
pending before the senate, lu the
meantime n temporar}' arrangement
has been made under which the Domin?
ican government hns appointed Ainer
j ieans to nil die Important positions in
'?be customs service, and they are see
I ng to the holiest collection of the rev
? iUUCS, turning over 45 per cent to the
government for running expenses and
putting tho other g? per cent Into n
safe depositary for equitable division
I'n case the treaty shall be ratified
. among the various creditors, whether
: European or American,

order nnd oli the benefits of pence tiro

1 lie not believe that any army lu tin

vies of other nations, always be of
iireater si/..- than our army. We have
most wisely continued for a number of
years to build up our navy, and it
'.eis now reached a fairly high standard
of efficiency, 'this standard must not
? ?id ? be maintained, hut Increased. It
do ? not seem to me necessary, how?
ever, that the navy should, at least In
tlie immediate future, he increased be?
yond the present number of units.
What is now clearly necessary i* to
substitute efficient for Inefficient units
as tlie latter become worn out or as It
be.-- me'-! apparent that they arc use?
less, 1'robnlily Ihe remit would be
at tu hied i,y adding a single battleship
to our navy each year* the superseded
or outworn vessels being laid up or
broken up as they are thus replaced.
Xntaraliiatlou.
On this subject I recommend;
First.?A federal bureau of naturali?
zation, t-> 1"- established in the depart?
ment ol commerce and labor, to su?
pervise ihe administration of the natu?
ralization i-iws and to receive returns
of naturalizations pending and accom?
plished.
Si coiid. -Uniformity of naturalization
certificates, fees to be charged, and
procedure.
Third. More oxnetli.K qualifications
for citizenship.
Fourth, The preliminary deeiuratlnn
of Intention to bo abolished and no
alien to bo naturalized until at least
ninety days after the filing of his peti?
tion.
Fifth. ? Jurisdiction to naturalize
aliens to be confined to United States
district courts and to such state courts
as have jurisdiction In civil notions In
which He- amount in controversy Is un?
limited; in cities of over 100.000 inhab?
itants the United States district courts
to have exclusive Jurisdiction In the
{ naturalization of the alien residents of
such cities.
Criminal Law?.
In my last message 1 asked the nt
tent ion of the congress to the urgent
need of action to make our criminal
law more effective, and 1 most ear?
nestly request that .ton pay heed to
the report of tlie attorney general on
this subject.
There seems to he no statute of tbe
United States which provide? for the
punishment of u United states attor
j ney or other officer of the government
I who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do
or wrongfully refrain from doing any
act when the consideration for such
corrupt agreement is other than ono
possessing money value. This outfht to
be remedied by appropriate legislation,
Legislation should also be enacted to
j cover explicitly, unequivocally and be?
yond question breach of trust in the
I shape of prematurely divulging official
secrets by an officer or employee of the
! United States and to provide a suitable
penalty therefor.
Merchant Marine.
To tb?. spread of our trade iu peace
nud tbe defense of our Dag In war n
great and prosperous merchant marine
Is Indispensable. Wo should have ships
of our own and seamen of our own to
convey our goods to neutral markets
.nul in ease of need to re-enforce our
battle line. Ii cannot bill be a source
of regret and uneasiness to us that the
lines of communication with our i ??
republics of ?outh Ann rlcn should bo
chiefly under foreign control, li la n
a good thing that American merchautJ
and manufai turers should have to send
their k.hmIs :,i>.i letters to South Amer?
ica via Europe if they wish security
ami dispatch. Even on the Pacific,
where our ships have held their own
better than on the Atlantic, our mer?
chant flag is now threatened through
the liberal as! I? -'owed by other k>,v
erhments on their own steam lines. 1
I ask your earnest consideration of the
: report with which the merchant ma
i r!r,e commission has followed its Ions
! and careful inquirj.
It Is a inaiter of unmixed satisfac
I tion oiico more to call attention to the
i excellent work of ihe pension bureau,
for the veterans of the elvi! war have
a greater claim upon us than any other
ciass of our citizens. To them first of
.nil nmong our people honor Is due.
Iminlffrntion.
As l said in my lasl message to the
congress, we cannot have too much
immigration of the right sort, ami wo
should have none whatever of the
wrong ?ort.
