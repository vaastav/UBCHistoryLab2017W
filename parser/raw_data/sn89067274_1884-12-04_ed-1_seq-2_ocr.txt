The subject of Rev. Dr. Burchard's
diortmrsA last Sunday nierht waslCrittendeo. is a thought not to be I
"Why am I not in Heaven?" This
is a conundrum which will be hard
to answer.
E. C. Thomas, of Plattsburg, Ma,
is a candidate for re-election as door
keeper of the house. He made an
efficient officer last season and we
presume will be re-elected.
Hon. F. C. Farr, private secretary I
to Gov. Crittenden, is favorably spo-
ken of as the clerk of the new Court
of Appeals. We do not presume
there is a Democrat in the btate betr
ter qualified for this place, or one
who, for his age, has done as much
work for as little pay for the party.
Gov. Cleveland is heir to the $12,-
000 estate of Alexander McGill of
Pittsburg, who died in 1878, after
willing the reversion of his property
to the "first Democratic president 01 0 arrived on a late trait to
the United States." This is all the Laving eoaB by way 0f
money weveiana us. n
and sell made man. ue naa 10 oor-
row $2,000 of the $5,000 he paid as
his political assessment.
The Saline County Democrat want-
ed Judge Strother appointed on the
new court of appeals at Kansas City. I
Strother was not appointed. Now
the Democrat makes a fuss about the
amendment being "carried by fraud."
We would not suppose the Democrat
would want Strother appointed to an
office created by fraud. The Demo-
erat did not of course find (?) this
out till its man was left
While in St. Louis this week we
saw Adam Bodemyre, of the Cen
tralia Guard, and T. W. Carter, of
the Sturgeon Leader, arm in arm
coming out of BessehTB. They are
friends. : We presume they had been
burying their quarrels in beer. We
buried ours with our cotemporary
under the depot at New London.
Somehow neither of us can forget
the place where the grave is.
In the excitement over Cleveland's
election Democrats appear to have
forgotten Tilden. Tilden is the man
who suggested Cleveland. His elec
tion to a great extent is due to the
hearty endorsement given him by
the man who knew he would carry out
his ideas of reform, and being young
er was to that extent better equal to
the struggle to be encountered both
before and after election.
Secretary of Interior.
Henry J. Watterson, of the Louis
ville Courier-JournaV agrees with
the Ledges that Gov. T. T. Critten
den should be Secretary of the In
terior, and savs : "Governor Critten
den was a gallant Union soldier, and
both as congressman and chief exec
utive of Missouri made his mark
He would scatter the rings and re
form the service if placed at the head
of the interior department."
Wake Up.
We hear some talk against the pro
posed 20c on the $100 levy to im
prove Hardin Park. What do you
want to do with the park, plow it up
and plant it in corn? We might as
well burn the town down and sow it
in turnips unless we wake up. We
have no water, no gas, no street
lamps, no manufactories and some
people are not in favor of even im
proving a park that was given to us
Prospectlie Railroad.
We see it stated that the Indianap
olis St Louis railroad company,
whose road on the east side of the
Mississippi river is completed to
within seven miles of Clarksville, in
Pike coo nty, Mo., where they have a
charter for a bridge, will extend their
road to Kansas City or to a connec
tion with the Bee Line, via Clarksville,
Wellsville, Columbia. Bocheport, and
Arrow Rock. Their line will run 17
miles south of Mexico.
Beek Agent Rewarded.
Our cotemporary hardly ever says
a good word for a man who wants an
. office, unless he is the editor or own
er of that paper. But we notice it
steps a little to one side to support
the book agent who once entertained
the editor of the Lkdokb so rapidly,
for sergeant-at-arma. We suppose
the editor wants to reward the book
agent for doing what he himmlf has
often wanted to do but for private
a&a sufficient reasons refrained from
doing. '
Correct.
Euros Ihtelugskcek : Why is it
that some fellows whom Providence
for some inscrutable purpose has per
mitted to publish newspapers, do not
publish election results fully and
fairly, giving total votes and drawing
comparisons founded upon the facts
as shown by the figures? Jcuus.
Simply because, comparisons are
odious to such fellows-rEo. Iktel-
UOEXCEB. - , :,f-:, '
The. above' is '. correct; especially
when the editor; referred to was
"permitted by Providence for some
inscrutable, purpose! to be ode of the
candidates referred to in the lection
result and ran; behind sbis ticket
Odious" is no name for it to him.

'you are talked of in connection with
Mr. Cleveland's cabinet. The Cour
ier-Journal thinks the president
would not go amiss if he called you
into his counsel ?"
.UI saw that article," said Governor
Crittenden. "I will say this in re
gard to the matter : That I am mak
ing no efforts whatever in that direc
tion : that I have not taken any steps
whatever. Prom here I go to" New
York, but I do not expect to see
Governor Cleveland. My business
there is to look over the bonds de
posited there by the Bank of Com
merce, of St Louis, Missouri 6s and
government 4s, as security for the
state's money. . It is my duty to
count them and I am doing this for
the last time before going out of of
fice so as to make my final report on
the state's finances. I am anxious to
get back to Missouri as soon as the
business here and in Jew xort is
transacted, and, as I said, shall prob
ably Iturn without seeing Governor
Cleveland."
Speaking more generally about the
cabinet, Governor Crittenden said:
"If the senators and representatives
from Missouri united in earnest sup
port of the movement ur state might
perhaps be given a place in the cabi
net. The electoral vote of Missouri
is one of the largest given the Demi ;
ocratic party. Col. Broadhead and
Gov. Phelps have both been urged
by their friends. If the attorney-
generalship goes to Senator Garland,
of Arkansas,, as seems to be quite
probable, it may be that claims which
Missouri might have will be consid-
rrl nvftrsWlnwr Artunnas Vwrnic
an adioininff state."
It was quite evident that the gov
ernor had made up his mind not to
He awake at night thinking of cabi
net appointments.
Lieut-Gov. Campbell also came in
to-night, there being, however, no
understanding between Gov. Crit
tenden and himself about the trip.
Governor Campbell did not know
until he was en route that Gov. Crit
tenden was also on the way. In the
present peaceful condition of affairs
he did not think Missouri would suf
fer if deprived of an executive head
for a brief period, and so he came on.
Speaking of his purpose, he said:
"I wanted to see congress in session ;
to see legislation in actual progress,
and that is what I came on for. I
shall be here several . days long
enough to satisfy my curiosity, and
then go home. That is all the sig
nificance my business has."
President's Message.
The Ledger furnishes the Presi
dent's Message this , week complete
in supplement form. It is rather
dry reading but contains facts tbat
every voter should know. It is the
last Republican message the country
will have for years and our subscri
bers should save it, for, in the course
of 20 years, it will be a curiosity.
Crasy sr Hsly. ;
Mrs. Capt Strode.' 'of Howard
county, passed through here last
week on the way to the asylum at
Fulton. - She went crazy on the sub
ject of Holiness. There are several
people in this vicinity who think
themselves holy when, as a matter of
fact, they are crasy. ' If they are not
crazy they are ranting-cantittg hypo

Close of the Campaign.
The monotony of Thanksgiving
Day was somewhat relieved at - three
o'clock in the afternoon by a novel
wheelbarrow procession around the
public square, the result of an' elec
tion wager made between Mayor R.
H. Fowler and L. H. Hightshoe, the
and Herman Stellhornr another good
Republican. Both Democrats enjoy-1
ed their ride, which was witnessed
by a large crowd, after which the
Mayor made a brief speech of con- j
dolence to his less fortunate mends
who furnished the muscle for the oc
casion. Mr. Herman Stellhora also
made a short speech which brought
tears to his Republican friends. It
was hard to tell whether the riders or
propellers enjoyed the affair the
most. Everv one was in o-nrwl humor
and all participating agreed that
1 hanksgmng day was the proper
time and a wheelbarrow procession
the proper affair to close the cam
paign. ' -' " :'; :" " ' "

Thanksgiving Day. .
Thanksgiving was generally ob
served in this city. - Union service
was held at the Christian church and
was largely attended, ur. jonu
Wayman conducted the services, as
sisted by Bev. J. S. Smith, Elder J.
W. Higbee and others. The choir
was under the leadership of Prof. K.
H. Kinzie, and rendered some excel
lent sacred music. After services a
collection for the benefit of the
worthy poor was taken up, and
quite a handsome contribution was
the result. - The donation was turned
over to a committee from the differ-
ent consisting of Mrs. Win
Stuart, Mrs. Josiah Wright, Mrs. G.
M. Carroll, Mrs. John P. Clark and
and Mrs. James Callaway, for distri
bution, v No such Thanksgiving has
been observed here for years.
