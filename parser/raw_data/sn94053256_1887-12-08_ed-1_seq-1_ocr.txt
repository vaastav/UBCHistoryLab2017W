New Youk. Dc 8. Inspector Byrnes
lnt rv i g i-wyed the host to an unusually
channii.gjjii-'onfr. Mrs. Mariana La Touche.
Sue is ti ull bruiu-tte of charming manners
and ad In ss The inspector was Chester-fit-Man
in . in wi' como to her. Yet she
w u i not tuU to htm nt first on the sub
ji'C s i i .ii:Hii hu whs interested. Tiie con-t-t
o. jo ;i?;:iss l) tveen the gentlemanly
h?u- iv a i lit ' rhariiiins lady prisoner
wastiil.M y tivr bein. locked up.
Ji r . L i Toucl.o wns arrested at her office,
105 AV s T.v.-nty-tliitd street, where, behind
a in a hign of "Banker and Broker,"
she ..' a 11 t little business with women
who i.ro ivady to believe that $50 a month
income on i n investment of $300 is quite an
easy i.eci m-jlishment to a fluancial genius
like l he madam. The women customers
Were brought to her by delusive advertise
ments promising enormous gains, yet their
unm-i s: 1 t xjwienco was that of losses. For
sevt-rat wivks I.ispector Byrnes has received
complaints about Mrs. La Touche from her
confiditis victims. But it was not
until yesterday that he succeeded in
finding one with nerve enough to make a
formal complaint in the matter, though
there wero many who sorrowfully admitted
that their experience with the "banker and
broker" had cost them from $300 to $800
each. Mis, Clara Johnson, of No. 156 East
Eighty-second street, the complainant, was
only induced to come forward by long per
suasion on the part of the inspector. Her
complaint was made before Justice Gorman
at Jefferson Market yesterday, and a war
rant was issued. Detectives McManus and
Lyman found the woman broker in her office
counting up her money, and after her re
sistance to the inspector's blandishments, as
already explained, she was locked up.
Lat.T in the evening when the inspector
favored her with another interview in his
rocm, she was rather more inclined to talk.
The inspector was not quite so polite. From
what she told him and what he already
knew, Inspector Byrnes is able to give his
prisoner's history since 1870. She was then
living in Boston as the wife of a man named
Warren, where they were both arrested sev
eral times on charges of swindling. They
seemed to have escaped conviction. Not
long after an experience ot, this sort War
ren died or disappeared. Mrs. Warren
thereupon, with littln loss of time, married
a man named Dow and opened a fashiona
ble boarding house on the Back Bay. Dow
did not last long. She retained the name of
Mrs. Dow after hia death and made it quite
well known to the police of the states, east
and wist, and in Canada. In 1875 she depos
ited in a Boston bank a certificate of stock of
the Michigan Central road, that had been
raised from one to sixty shares. A few days
later she endeavored to negotiate a loan on
the basis of sixty shares. But in the mean
time the bank had discovered the forgery.
She managed to get away and fled to St.
John, N. B., where she soon afterward got
into trouble through trying to negotiate a
forged check Tor $1,700. She was arrested
and tried for this offense, but the jury dis
agreed. While awaiting her second trial she
jumped her bail and sought refuge in the
United States.
After a little trip west Mrs. La Touche
opened a banking office in Union square, in
this city. She did little business, and
di opped out of sight, next being heard from
in Moyamensing prison, Philadelphia. In
1883 she opened a broker's office in Thirty
seventh street, this city, and became in
volved in swindling operations that caused
her arrest and imprisonment for two yeari.
She has been free about eight months.
The woman says she became acquainted
with Royal La Touche in Philadelphia in
1SS1, and has been married to him some time.
Mr. La Touche called upon Inspector Byrnes
in the evening and said that he had been
married to the woman only a few months.
He claims to be in a reputable business at
SO Pine street. He is not unknown to the
police, but his only trouble that has resulted
in imprisonment was a conviction for bigamy,
on which he was sent to Sing Sing for three
years. He was there from 1883 to 1886.
The Mystery of a Freight Car.
Buffalo, Dec. 8. Yesterday morning an
unknown man was found lying in a pool of
blood in an empty box car which left Dewitt,
N. Y., Tuesday afternoon. The man was
unconscious, badly chilled from exposure,
and had a compound fracture of the skull.
He was taken to the General hospital. In
the pockets of his clothes was found two
pieces of a watch chain, a long Russia
leather pocketbook containing a slip of
paper and some cards bearing tho name,
"Charles Waterstraw, Macedon, N. Y.,"
thirty-six postage stamps and $95 in money.
He is a young man, about 20 years of age,
five feet eight inches in height, smooth face,
wearing suit of corkscrew goods, with sack
coat and dark overcoat. His condition at
last accounts was critical.
Gettysburg monument Commission.
New York, Dec. 8. -The state board of
commissioners on Gettysburg monuments
held a meeting with closed doors yesterday.
Adjt. Gen. Josiah Porter was the only ab
sentee. Their designs for forty-three monu
ments were considered and, with minor
.changes, adopted. The names of the regi
ments and batteries will not be made public
until after two more meetings of the com
missioners, which will bo held to-day and
to-morrow. Plans for forty-three more
monuments will be considered. A sub com
mittee, consisting of Gen. Graham, Maj.
Gen. Carr and Maj. Richardson, was ap
pointed to consider proposed changes in tho
plans.
Congressman Delano's Opinion.
Washington, D.c 8. Congressman Mil
ton Delano (Rep.), of New York state, in an
Interview yesterday said : "Mr. Blaine will
be the Republican candidate for the presi
dency. I am quite sure New York is the
pivotal state, and Blaine will be the strong
est Republican there, as elsewhere. Before
the last elections I thought some other Re
publican might be better able to carry the
state, but I am now convinced that if it cant
be carried by Blaine it can't be carrie.l by
any Republican. The leaders of the Mug
wumps may vote for Cleveland again, but
the bulk of the independent vote will return
to Blaine."
Horrible Crime .of an Insane Mother.
Toronto, Dec. 8. Yesterday, in a fit of
insanity, the wife of John Fellowes, a sta
bleman, cut the head of her 6 weeks-old
babe completely off with a common table
knife and afterward cut an arm from the
body and cooked it for dinner. Although
married only four years, sho has bad four
children. She was delirous for some time
after the birth of her third child, and was
sent to an insane asylum until she recov
ered. The woman had frequent attacks of
melancholia, but was not thought to be in
THE MURDER OF A BABE.
t
Found Drowned at the Bottom of a Well.
Her Parents Arrested.
Dover, N. J., Dec. a Mrs. Cecilia Mack,
of Mt. Hope, a mining village three miles
from here, became a widow about seven
years ago. Her family of three children
was increased about a year and eight months
ago by the birth of a daughter. This child
was murdered , by some one, not
positively known, on Monday night.
Among those who frequented Mrs. Mack's
house was John Corrigan, a miner. He
is single, and is about 30 years eld. He says
he gave Mrs. Mack twenty-five cents on
Monday night with which to buy beer. She
went after is, taking one of her boys with
her, but leaving the eldest one at home sit
ting in a chair and holding the little girL
Corrigan says he dropped off to sleep in his
chair. He was aroused by Mrs. Mack in
quiring of him the whereabouts of the child.
He could not tell her, but he offered to look
for the child, whereupon, so he says, Mrs.
Mack drove him from the bouse with an ax,
as if he had made away with the child.
Mrs. Mack's story is that she left the house
at 10 o'clock on Monday night to buy some
crackers at a store. When she left the house
Corrigan, her eldest son, a boy of 15, and the
little girl were all lying in one bed and asleep.
She was absent about one hour. When she
came back she asked Corrigan whera the
little girl was, and he said he didn't know.
She then accused him of doing away with it
in order that he might be relieved of the re
sponsibility of its paternity. On Tuesday
Mrs. Mack, in peering down the well, saw an
object which she thought might be her child.
She obtained a grappling iron and raised the
body of the child from the well.
The oldest son says he was asleep during;
the absence of his mother, and he does not
know what occurred to the child, but ia
other respects he corroborates his mother's
story. The well is surrounded by a curb
which is nearly three feet high at its lowest
part, making it impossible for the child to
have fallen into it. Drs. J. W. Condict and
Arthur Condict found that death had been
caused by drowning. The affair has . been
kept so quiet that it was not made public
until' yesterday, when an inquest was held.
The jury rendered a verdict that the child
came to its death by drowning, and that
John Corrigan and Cecilia Mack were im
plicated in the cause. Both were taken to
the jail in Morristown.
VERONA JARBEAU'S DARING FEAT.
She Rescues a Child at the Imminent
Peril of Her Own Life.
Pittsburg, Dec. 8. As . the train on the
Erie and Pittsburg road drew into the depot
yesterday morning Charles White and wife,
of Erie, and their 4-year-old child, en route
to Altoona, stepped from the train to walk
on J the platform for a few moments. The
child ran from the platform on to the track
-as a freight train approached. Everybody
expected to see it crushed to death. The
members of the-Verona Jarbeau company
were boarding tho train to go on to Johns
town. Miss Jarbeau saw what had hap
pened, ran across the platform and first
track, reached the child, and by a herculean
effort succeeded in drawing the little one
away just before the train rushed over that
portion of the track where the child stood.
The train passed so closely that it threw
Mis3 Jarbeau upon the ground, but neither
the lady nor the child was hurt.
Connecticut Prohibitionists in Convention.
New .Haven, Dec. 8. The Prohibition
state convention was called to order yester
day afternoon by J. B. Smith, chairman of
the state executive committee. Rev. H. A.
Delano, of Fairfield county, was chosen tem
porary chairman, and oommittees on cre
dentials, permanent organization and nom
ination of national delegates were appointed.

Stabbed by a Convict.
Auburn, N. Y., Dec. 8. Alexander Bar
bara, a convict sentenced in New York in
1886 to eight years' imprisonment in -Sing
Sing, and transferred to Auburn in February
of the same year, while walking to the hall
from the yard in the prison yesterday after
noon, stepped up behind Keeper Bray and
stabbed him fourteen times with a shoe
knife. The keeper struck the infuriated
convict twice with his stick, and then fell to
tho ground exhausted. He was carried into
the keepers' hall and a physician summoned.
Several of his wounds are very deep and
painful. The reason assigned for tho attack
on Bray is that Barbara, who claimed to bo
sick, asked the keeper to send him to the hos
pital, which Bray refused to do. The physi
cian thinks Bray will recover.
An Anti-Thief Association.
Trenton, N. J., Deo. 8. About fifty of
the farmers who live within two or three

Essex counties have organized a society for
protection against thieves. It is called Ely's
Anti-Thief association, and has its headquar
ters at Afton, where the secretary and treas
urer, William F. Ely, lives. The object of
the organization is to secure the arrest and
conviction of thieves who steal from any of
the members, and, in the event of any such
depredation, a reward will be offered, graded
according to the nature of the theft. If a
horse is stolen a reward of $100 will be of
fered; any other thing, $50, if the thief is
sent to state prison, and $25 if he is only
sent to the county jail.

THE RULER OF THE NAY Y.
POINTS-FROM
TO
HIS ANNUAL
CONGRESS.
REPORT
He Opposes . Further Appropriations for
Work on Slngle-Turreted Monitors, and
Deprecates the Expenditure of Fortunes
in Experimental Ship Building;.
" Washington, Dec. a Secretary Whit
ney's report will be sent to congress to-morrow.
He says that, with the exception of
two cases, the department has practically
abandoned the idea of the unprotected tor
pedo boat, but he recommends the continu
ation of experiments in submarine boats.
Proposals for the construction of these boats
will he received at the navy department on
March 1. ..Mr. Whitney is opposed to any
further appropriation of money for work
on the single-, urreted monitors. He Bays:
"A first class modern ironclad could safely
aEchor, surrounded by a fleet of these moni
tors, without any danger of in jury to her
self , and any one of her guns could send a
projectile through the monitor from stem to
stern. It would be little less than murder-to.
send men in these vessels at the present time
to encounter any recently built ironclad. I
appreciate fully that it is only as a tempor
ary expedient that it is suggested, and with
the thought that, in the absence of anything
else, these might be better than nothing.
This has been the theory upon which over
$50,000,000, and probably $75,000,000, have
been spent since the closa of the war. It is
time to stop it and be content only with the
best. If every dollar is made to count upon
something of real value, waste will stop, and
not before."
He recommends that due attention be
given to the subject of pneumatic guns and
pneumatic gun carriages. On the subjects
of the naval reserve and coast defense he
says: ,
"The department has informed itself fully
of the different systems of organization for
coast defense and naval reserves at present
in force in foreign countries, and is pre
pared to formulate a general plan for a
similar organization to meet the require
ments and conditions of our own insti
tutions. It should resemble in organiza
tion tnat of the militia or national &uard,
rest upon the foundation of local interest,
contemplate the employment and rapid
mobilization of steamers enrolled on an aux
iliary navy list, and be calculated to pro
duce the best results upon a comparatively
small national expenditure. I ask for this
question the earnest consideration of con
gress. e may hoc do oue oi piace, us a
branch of this subject, to call attention to
one of the incidental consequences of the
policy pursued by other countries in
this matter of a naval reserve. In
time of war troop ships or transports
are in great demand. Several Euro
pean governments u ' make an annual
contribution, based on tonnage, to companies
constructing new vessels. The consideration
to the government is a counter agreement,
permitting the government to take the ves
sel for a transport in time of war upon terms
named in the agreement. The government
officials are also consulted as to her mode of
construction, and she goes on to the naval
reserve list. The payments are incidentally
in the nature of a subsidy to the shipowner,
and this, with the liberal payments for gov
ernment transportation of mails, etc., keeps
a large fleet of merchantmen afloat as a re
serve read' for a time of war. Without
ships and trained seamen there can be no
naval reserve."
The secretary recommends the construc
tion of five new ships, as follows: Two
armor clad vessels to cost, exclusive of
armament, not more than $6,000,000, one to
be built; by contract and one in the navy
yards, and thre8 more fast cruisers of the
highest type. He says that in six years only
four of the present cruising ships will remain
serviceable. In other words, the old navy
will have disappeared. Encouragement for
torpedo experiments is recommended, and
suggestion is made that the course in the
navaracademy be reduced to four years.
Looking for the Convention.
Washington, Dec. 8. There are half a
dozen delegations in Washington, number
ing from a score to fifty in each, to persuade
the national Republican committee, which
meets here to-day, that the particular .pity
each delegation represents is the best place
in the country to hold the Republican natiou)) prevented other
convention next summer. ' They come from
Chicago, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
Omaha and Minneapolis, with the chances of
success, according to opinion outside of the
visiting delegations, about in the order
named. The gossip in well informed circles
has it that the question now lies between
Philadelphia and Chicago.
Gone with a Railroad Brakeman.
Pulaski, N. Y., Dec. 8. Three weeks ago
Nellie Robie, daughter of a prominent mer
chant in Tyre, Seneca county, eloped with a
laborer in that place. Last Friday Jessie
Palmer, only daughter of the wealthiest
farmer in Victor, in Northern Cayusa, fled
with her father's hostler. Now Alice Wright
son has gone from Parish, in this county,
with a railroad brakeman. Her flight has
caused a sensation in this locality. Miss
Wrightson is heiress of the late Philip
Wrightson, who made a fortune in land
speculation, and left it to his three children.
Miss Wrightson inherits about $30,000 from
her father.
'President Carnot's Cabinet.
Paris, Dec. 8. President Carnot still de
lays the formation of a new ministry until
the Republican factions reach a more defi
nite agreement. He is determined that they
shall concentrate their strength, and ulti
mately they will do so. It seems scarcely
possible that they will fail of this in view of
the pledges already made by several of the
group presidents, and the establishment of a
cabinet is believed to be only a question of a
few days. ' M. Goblet informed President
Carnot last evening that he would undertake
to form a ministry.
Terribly Burned by Molten Metal.
Worcester, Dec. 8. Joseph Bushey and
John Carrigan, employes at the Worcester
steel works, were terribly burned while
drawing a heat from the converter yester
day. The converter tipped and threw the
molten metal over the men; completely cov
ering Carrigan, instantly burning every
shred of clothing from his body and crisp
ing bis flesh to the bone in many places. It;
is thought he will die. Bushey's clothes
were burned off his body to the waist. His
briyist, abdomen and one side were terribly
burned, but it is thought he will recover.
Sir. Sexton May be Counted Out.
Dublin, Dec. 8. Judge Holmes, of the
Irish court of queens bench, has granted a
conditional order setting aside Mr. Sexton's
election and qualifying acts to the office of
lerd mayor of Dublin, and the matter of
that gentleman taking his seat depends en
tirely upon the ultimate decision of the court
when the order is returned and argued. . The
grounds for debarring Mr. Sexton are that
be has violated the crimes act, and sin his
capacity as high sheriff neglected or refused
to perform all of the functions attaching to
bis office.
RAIDING THE BUCKET , SHOPS.
Philadelphia's Police Swoop Down Upon
the Small Stock Gamblers.
Philadelhhia, Dec 8. The strong arm
of the law swooped down upon the so called
bucket shops of Philadelphia yesterday, and
within an hour after the order was given for
the raid five of them were closed, and their
proprietors in custody at the Central station.
Altogether more than eighteen men were cap
tured. The places raided were those of C. II.
Garland & Co., S23 Chestnut street; Throck
morton, Chandler & Co., 88 South Fourth
street; F. A Parker & Co., 131 Bank street;
Stead & Co., Hudson place, and Walker &
Co., Girard house. Central office detectives
have been locating the establishments since
Nov. 25 last. - They bad made deals at four
teen places in all.' Although the matter ha.i
been kept quiet, nine of the places wero
found closed, and it is probable they had
received information of the intended raid.
The affidavit upon which the arrests were
made charges the prisoners with keeping
and maintaining a device and apparatus
used for the gain of money, and are there
fore common gamblers within the meaning
of the statutes. At all of the places, except
Walker & Co.'s office in the Girard house,
the proprietors were found. At Walker's,
Franklin Keyser, who said he was only a
clerk, was arrested as the proprietor. All
of them furnished $800 bail for court.
Suing: fo His Salary.
Boston' Dec. 8. Curly headed Rev. W.
W. Downs, he of ' the Bowdoin Square
church and Annie Taber scandal, is 'on deck
again. He appeared before , Judge Mason,
of the superior . civil court, yesterday, and
asked that the church pay him $1,908.23 as
salary due him at tho time of his dismissal
from the pastorate of the church. The case
was tried a year ago before Judge Aldrich
on its merits, without going into the scan
dal, and his honor decided in favor of Mr.
Downs. Then the church insisted that Mr.
Downs' record should be made public, and a
new trial was granted.' Gen. Benjamin F.
Butler and E. M. Johnson appeared for the
plaintiff, and Robert D. Smith and H. W.
Chaplain for the defense. The case was
oifened to-day. .
For Commander of New Jersey's G. A. R.
. Trenton, Dec. 8. The campaign for tho
election of a commander of the New J ersey
department of the Grand Army of tho Re
public grows warmer every day. The posts
at Burlington, Beverly, Camden, Glouces
ter, Salem, Tuckerton, Toms River, Wood
bury and Atlantic City have announced
their intention to support Gen. Grubb. The
present administration, which consists of
John L. Wheeler, department commander,
and Samuel N. Rockhill, of Bbrdentown, the
adjutant, is cordially indorsed by the upper
or east Jersey posts, who supported them
during election. With but a few exceptions
nearly all of the posts in the lower part of
the state are favorable to Gen. Grubb.
Joined the Knights of Labor.
Pittsburg, Dec. 8. George Harris, who
has been president of the Amalgamated
Association of Miners and Mine Laborers of
Pennsylvania for a number of years, and has
been engaged at times in a fight against the
Knights of Labor, has made a change of
base, and one which will doubtless startle
the miners of the state. Mr. Harris has con
nected himself with National District 135,
K. of L., composed exclusively of miners,
and will at once enter the field as an organ
izer for the K. of L. This information
comes officially from Columbus, O.,
headquarters of the National district.

The Indictment Against Kissane Dismissed
New York, Dec. 6. On motion of District
Attorney Martine the indictment for forgery
. against William Kissane, found in November,
1854, was dismissed yesterday by Recorder
Smyth. Kissane, who is now a wealthy resi
dent of California, known as W. K Rogers,
was charged in tho indictment with forging
a check on the Chemical National bank, of
this city. The case was forgotten until Gen.
Dorr, a bitter enemy of Kissane, revived the
matter a few months ago and led to Rogers'
exposure. The district attorney says it is
impossible to make out a case at this late day.
Troops Under Arms in Ohio.
Cleveland, O., Dec. 8. The action of
Governor Foraker in ordering tho Fifth reg
iment under arms was due to a dispatch
from Sheriff Austin, of Lake county, who
xxrae Hoeirniis nf nrrpstinc strilrino" rr hnn-
men from taking their-places. The strike
ha3 been on since Monday, SOiBS ?QQ men
being out. No violence has yet occurred,
but the sheriff is fearful that if arrests are
attempted trouble may ensue with which he
is not able to cop?. It is possible that they
will be sent to Fairport to-day.
A Montreal Sensation.
Montreal, Dec. 8. Quito a sensation was
caused last night by the arrest of Melvin
Smith, one of our wealthiest citizens, on a
capias for $80,000. Some time ago he sued
for a divorce from his wife, but every one
of the charges fell through, and she obtained
a separation of property and alimony allow
ance of $5,000 a year. This has not been
paid, and the lady sued him for $80,000, the
amount capitalized for sixteen years. Smith
was disposing of his property preparatory to
removing to the United States, when he was
arrested. -
"Bunko" Men Arrested.
New York, Dec 8. Central Office De
tectives Casper and McCord made a raid
yesterday on a "bunko" game and head
quarters for "green goods" men at 166 Leon
ard street, and arrested five men who were
interested, in the place. The raid was made
through information furnished by a young
man from Cleveland, O., who went to police
headquarters on Tuesday and complained to
Inspector Williams that he had been robbed
of $10 in the place.
A Brakeman Killed.
Port Huron, Mich., Dec 8. A freight
train on the Grand Trunk railway broke in
two Tuesday night while descending the
grade near Goodells Station. The front end
was side tracked at the station, and while
returning for the rear portion the engine

injuring Jeffray, the engineer, and Robert
McKay, fireman. The engine and cars were
badly wrecked. -
Anticipated Trouble Averted.
Chicago, Dec. 8. The proposed demon
stration in aid of the families of the executed
Anarchists, which was to have been held in
Batter v. D. Dec. 10, will not take place. The
committee of arrangements feel that in the
present state of public opinion it would not
be advisable to hold the demonstration, and
the Battery D people were more than pleased
to have them forego the right to use the hall.
Two Men Crushed to Death.
Portsmouth, O., Dec. 8. The Buckeye
flouring mills of M. H. Anderson, in this
citv were burned last night. The east wall
of the building fell, crushing M. II. Ander

LITTLE BULGARIA AGAIN I
THE
CONFERENCE BETWEEN THE
CZAR AND BISMARCK.
The Iron Chancellor's Refusal to Rapture
the Triple Alliance Slakes Russia's
Ruler Angry He Will Doubtless Seek
Revenge by Crushing Bulgaria.
London, Dec 8. The complications which
have arisen between Austria and Russia are
becoming more and more difficult of solu
tion, and are undoubtedly the outcome of
the recent interview in Berlin between Prince
Bismarck and the czar. Notwithstanding
the assertions of the German press that none
of the publications purporting to state the
substance of that interview is correct in a
single particular, suspicion has arisen from
the tenor of the recent official correspondence
by mail and by telegraph, from the informa
tion obtained by several reliable correspon
dents and from the tone of the various con
tinental bourses, that the czar quitted the
German capitol in a towering rage, fomented
by the aggressiveness of the iron chancellor.
A correspondent gives the following ver
sion of what occurred between Bismarck and
the imperial visitor, which is believed, in
view of subsequent events, to bi substan
tially correct: The czar demanded the
abrogation of the new triple alliance between
Germany, Austria and Italy, accompanying
his demand with an outspoken denunciation
of the compact as being not only an exhibi
tion of bad faith, but of positive menace to
Russia. Prince Bismarck flatly refused to
rupture the new agreement, and the czar
withdrew.
Russia now hopes to crush Bulgaria, and
will attempt it by force of arms if diplomacy
or menace fails; and this is her sole object in
massing troops in Galicia, a movement

centered upon the result of to-day's imperial

chance of success against Russia than she
had in her memorable attempt to chastisa
Prussia.

'It was d'one entirely bv my orders, and
I am ready to take all the responsibility.
What was placed in the mouths of the
scholars was a thin piece of board 3-16 of
an inch thick, and just two inches square,
which the scholars were required to hold
by the corner between their teeth, and is
no worse than to hold a piece of paper be
tween the teeth. This was done as a pun
ishment for talking and shouting and
laughing and screaming in school, not for
once, but elmost continually. I do not see
anything cruel or barbarous about it, but
it was a mild and effectual remedy for the
time being. I have been told that scholars
in other schools in town have been pun
ished by being made to hold things in
their mouths, even the present terms of
school, and it was not thought to be de
moralizing." state. n
