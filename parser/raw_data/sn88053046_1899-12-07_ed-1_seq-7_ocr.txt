DKPENC E OK PHILIPPINE POLICY.
On tho 10th of December, 189«, tho
treaty <>f peace between the United

tliould code to tho United Slates tho

From the harliest moment no oppor

ol tho islands of our ardent desire for
their welfare and of the intoution of
this government to do everything pos
sible to advance their interest. In my
order of tbe 19th of May, 1898, the

tno United States must preserve the

within tho territory occupied by their
military and naval forces; that the iu

of the United States. As early an De
cumber 4th, before the cession, and in
anticipation of that event, the com
rged to res tor o
peace and tranquility and to undertake
the establishment of a benofioont
hioh should, afford tho
fullest security for life and property.
On the 21st of December, after the
treaty was signed, the commander of
the forces of occupation was instructed
"to announce and proclaim in tho most
public manner that wo come, notas in
vaders and conquerors,but as fiiends to
protêt t the natives in their homes, in
employments, and in their per
lai and religious rights." On tho
Fame day, while ordering Gen. Otis
that tho peace should be prosorved
in Iloilo, he was admonished thnt "it
is-' most important that ttaore should be
nu conflict, with insurgents." Oh the
1st day of January, 1899, urgent orders
were reiterated that tho kindly inten
tions of this government should be in
(•very possible way communicated to tho
insurgents.
On tho 21st day of January I an
nounced my intention of dispatching to
-Manila a commission oomposod of three
Kent lernen of the highest chtfraoter
mul distinction, thoroughly acquainted
with the Orient who, in association
with Admiral Dewey and Major Gou
wal Otis, were instructed "to facilitate
the most humane and effeotive exten
sion of authority throughout the
islands, and to secure with the least
l»8sib!e delay the benefits of a wise
und generous protection of life and
property to the inhabitants." These

iuvite your attention to tho report of tho
commissioners for the interesting and en
couraging details of the work already
accomplished in tho establishment of
peace and order and the inauguration of
self governing municipal life in many
portions of the archipelago. A notable
beginning has been made in the establish
ment of a government in tho Island of
Negros which is deserving of special
comddoration. This was tho first island
to accept American sovereignty. Its peo
ple un resolvedly proclaimed allegiance
to the United States and adopted a con
stitution looking to the establishment of a
popular government. It was impossible
to guarantee to the pcnplo of Negros that
the constitution so adoptod should be the
ultimato form of government. Such a
question, under the treaty with Spain and
iu accordance with our own constitution
and laws, came exclusively withi
jurisdiction of the Congress. The gov
ernment actually set up by the inhabi
tants of Negros eventually proved unsat
lefactory to tlio natives tllemaelvea. A new
system was put into force by order of the
major-general commanding the depart
ment, of which the following are the
most important elements:
It whs ordered that the government of
the Islaud of Negros should consist of a
military governor appointed by the
Untied States military governor of the
Philippines, and a civil governor and
advisory council elected by tho people.

reconstruction should not begin by

THE SITU ATI
A necessity for immediate . legislative

Substantially the only '.aw providing a
civil government for this territory is the
act of May 17th, 1884. This is meagre in
its provisions, am) is fitted only for thu
administration of affairs in a coun
try sparsely inhabited by civilized
people and unimportant in trade
and not productive, jis was Alaska at the
was passed. The increase

in population by immigration during the
past few years, consequent upon the dis
covery of gold, has produced such a con

for local self government and more

ceedings and tho ordinances passed by
such municipalities arc without statutory
authority and have no sanction, except
they are maintained by the popular
sentiment of the community. There is
entire absence of authority to provide
ordinary instruments of local police
control and administration, the popula
tion consisting of tho usual per
centage of lawless adventurers of
class that always docks
new fields of enterprise or discoveries,
and under circumstances which require
c thau ordinary provision for the
maintenance of peace, good order and
lawful conduct.
Tho whole vast area of Alaska com
prises but one judicial district, with
judge, one marshal and one district at

has more than doubled within tho past
year, and is many times greater both in
volume aud importance tliau it

him to travel thousands of miles to dis
charge his judicial duties at the various
places designated for that purpose. The
territory should he divided into at least
two judicial districts, and an additional
judge, district attorney, marshal and
other appropriate officers be provided.
There is practically no organized form
government in the territory. There is
no authority, except in Congress, to Dass
any law, 110 matter how local or trivial,
and the difficulty of conveying to tho
Congress an adequate conception and
understanding of tho various needs of
the people in the different communities is
easily understood. I see no reason why
more complete form of territorial
organization should not be provided.
Following the precedent established in
tho year 1805, when a temporary govern
ment
acquired territory, then known under the
name of tho Louisiana, it seems to
me that it would be advantageous to
confer greater executive power upon tho
governor and to establish, as was done in
the caso of the Territory of Louisiana, a
legislative council, having power 10 adopt
ordinances which shall extend to all their
rightful subjects of local legislation such
ordinances,not to take effect until reported
to and approved by tho Congress if in
session, aud if that body is not in session,
then by the President. In this manner a
system of laws providing for the incor
poration and goverument of towns and
cities having a certain population, giving
them tho power to establish and main
tain a system of education to bo locally
supported, and ordinances providing for
police, aunitarv and other such purposes,
could bo speedily provided. I believe a
provision of this kind would be satisfac
tory to the people of the territory. It is
probable that the area is too vast and the
population too scattered and trausitory to
make it wise at the present time to pro
vide for an elective legislative body, but
the conditions calling for local and solf
governuient will undoubtedly very
exist and will be facilitated by the
which I have recommended.
to roiiTO RICO.

require
provided for tho recently
I recommend that legislation to tho
same end be had with reference to tho
government of Porto Rico. The time is
ripe for the adoption of a temporary form
of government for this island and
many suggestions mado with reference
to Alaska are applicable to Porto Rico.
The system of civil jurisprudence adopted
by the people of this island, as described
by competent lawyers who are familiar
with it, is thoroughly modern and scien
tific,so far as it relates to matters of inter
nal business, trade, production and social
and private rights in general. The cities
of the island are governed under charters
which probably require very little
change. So that with relation to matters
of local concern and private rights, it is
not probable that much if any legislation
is desirable; but with reference to public
administration and the relations of tho
island to tho federal government there
are many matters which are of pressing
urgency. The same necessity exists for
legislation of tho part of Congress to es
tablish federal courts and federal juris
diction in the island as has been pre
viously pointed out by mo with reference
to Hawaii. Besides the administration
of justice there are subjects of the public
lands; tbe control and improvements of
rivers and harbors; of tho waters
streams not navigable, which under the
Spanish law belonged to Spain, and have
by the treaty of cession passed to the
United States, tho immigration of people
from foreign countries; the importation
of contract labor; the imposition and col
lection of internal revenue; the appli
cation of the navigation laws; the
regulation of tho current money; the
establishment of poBtofllces and post
roads, tho regulation of tariff rates on
merchandise imported from the island
into the United States; tho establishment
of ports of entry and delivery; tho regula
tion of patents aud copyrights; these,
with various other subjects which rest
entirely within the power of the Congress
call for grateful consideration and im
mediate action..
It must be borne in mind that since the
cession l'orto Rich has been denied tho
principal markets she had long enjoyed,
tariffs have been continued
when she was
and
against her products
under Spanish sovereignty. Tlio markets
closed to her products ex

As a result of tho hurricane which
swept over Porto Rico on the 8th of
Ausiust, 1899, over 100,000 people were
reduced to absolute destitution, without
homes and deprived of the necessities of
life. To the appeal of the War Depart
ment the people of the United States
made prompt aud generous response. In
addition to the private charity of
people, the War Department has ex
pended for tlio relief of the distressed
$392,342.03 which does not include
cost of transportation.
It is desirable that tho government of
tho island under tho law of belligerent
right, now maintained through tho
ecutive department, should be super
ceded by an administration entirely civil
in its nature. For the present purpose I
recommend that Congrese pass a law for
tho organization of a temporary govern
t, which shall provide for the ap
pointment by tho President, subject to the.
confirmation by tlio rfeuute, of a govern of
and such other officers us the general acr
minist ration of the island may require,and
that for legislative purposes upon sub

effect. In the
municifalities and other local sub
divisions I recommend that the
principle of local self gov
applied at
intelligent citizens of the island to
participate In their own government and
learn by prnctical experiences the
duties aud requirements of a self
taiued and self-governing people. I have
thought it wise to commit to tho
entile government of the island to offi
cers selected by the people, because I
doubt whether in habits, training and
to fit them to
ment
to enable
perieuco they arc such
exercise at once so large a degree of self
government; but it is my judgment aud
expectation that they will soon arrive at
attainment of experience and wisdom
and self control that will justify confer
ring upon them a much larger participa
tion in the choice of their insular officers.
The fundamental requirements for
these people, as for all people, is educa
tion. Tho free sekoolhouse is the best
preceptor for citizenship. In the instruc
tion of modern educational matters
however, must be exercised that changes
not made too abruptly and that the
history and racial peculiarities of the In
habitants shall be given due weight. Sys
tems of education in
sions founded upon
methods, adapted to existing conditions
and looking to tho further moral and$in
dustrial advancement of the people, will
will commend to them in a peculiarly
effective maimer the blessings of free gov
ernment.
these new posses
common sense
of law and the sense of obedi
and submission to the lawfully
constituted judicial tribunals are
imbedded in the hearts of our people, and
auy violation of these sentiments and dis
regard of their obligations justly arouse
public condemnation. The guaranties of
life, liberty and of civil rights should be
faithfully upheld; the right of trial by
jury respected and defended. The rule
of the courts assure tho public of the
prompt trial of those charged with crim
inal offenses, and upon conviction the
punishment should bo commensurate
with the enormity of the crime.
Those who, in disregard of law and the
public peace, unwilling to await, the judg
ment oNcourt and jury, constitute them
selves judges aud executioners, should
not escape the severest penalties for their
crimes.
VVhat 1 said in my inaugural address
of March 4, 1897, 1 now repeat:
"The constituted authorities must bo
cheorfully und vigorously uphold. Lynch
ing must not be tolerated in a great and
civilized country like the United States.
Courts, not mobs, qiust execute the pen
alties of the laws. The preservation of
public order, the right of discussion, the
integrity of courts, and the orderly ad
ministration of justice must eontinifb for
the rock of safety upon which
gu vein meut securely rests."
MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS.
I,
In accordance with the act of Congress
providing for au appropriate national
celebration in the year 1900 of the estab
lishment of the seat of government in
the District of Columbia, I have ap
pointed a committee of the governors of
all the States and Territories of the
Uuited Statos, who have been invited to
assemble in the city of Washington on
21st day of December, 1899, which, with
ihe committees ot the Congress and the
District of Columbia, arc charged with
the proper conduct of this celebration.
Congress at its last session appropriated
fivo thousand dollars to enable the chief
of engineers of the army to continue tho
examination of the subject and to make
secure designs calculations and esti
mates for a memorial bridge from the
most convenient point of tho Naval Ob
servatory grounds
across the Potomac Hiver o
convenient point of tbe Arlington estate
property. In accordance with the pro
visions of this act thu chief of engineers
has selected four eminent designs for a
bridge combining tbe elements of strength
and durability with such architectural
embellishment and ornamentation as will
fitly apply to the dedication, "A me
morial to American patriotism." The
designs
udjacent thereto,
the most
being prepared, aud as
as completed will be submitted to
the Congress by tho Secretary of War.
The proposed bridge would bo a con
venience to all the people from every
part of tbe country who visit the National
cemetery, an ornament to tho capital of
the nation, and forever stand as a monu
ment to American patriotism. 1 do not
doubt that Congress will give to the
enterprise still further proof of its favor
and approval.

dome of tho inclusions wore found
wholly illogical and un suited to the work
of the several departments. Tho appli
cation of the rules to many of tho places
so included was found to result in fric
tion and embarrassment. After long and
very careful consideration it become evi
dent to the hoads of the departments, re
sponsible for their efficiency and in order
to remove these difficulties and promote
efficient and harmonious administra
tiou certain amendments were necessary.
These amendments were promulgated by
in executive order, dated Muy 29tb,
1899. # .
The principal purpose of tho order was
to except from competitive examination
certain places involving fiduciary respon
sibilities or duties of a strictly confiden
tial, scientific
which it
filled either by
tion,
mg officer, tiian by open competition.
These places are comparatively few in
number. Tho order provides for the fill
ing of a much larger number of places,
mainly in the outside service of tho War
Department by what is know
registration system, under regulations t
be approved by the President, similar to
those Which have produced such admira
ble results iu the navy yard service.
All of the amendments had for their
main object a more efficient and satisfac
tory administration of the system of ap
pointments established by the Civil Ser
vice law. The results attained show that
under their operation the public service
has improved and that the Civil Service
system is relieved of mauy objectionable
features which heretofore subjected it to
criticism and the administrative
officers to the charge of unbusiness like
methods in the conduct of public affaiis.
