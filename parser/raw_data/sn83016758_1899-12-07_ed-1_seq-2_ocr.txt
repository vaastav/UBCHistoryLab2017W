Garrison There, Though Still
Strong, Suffering From
Confinement,
Restricted Diet, and Increasingly
Effective Boer Artillery,
Practice.
Jonbert Reported Indisposed at
Volksrust-Schalkburger
in Command.
LONDON, Dec. 7.A budget of news
from Ladysmith which has just arrived
brings the history of the beleagured
garrison up to Nov. 29. In spite of the
rumors of a. retrogade movement upon
the part of the Boers, the stories just
received show that the garrison, al
though still strong, was suffering from
confinement, restricted diet and the in
creasing volume of the artillery fire,
especially that of an additional heavy
calibre gun placed in position 5,000
yards from the western defenses. The
dispatches relate that the Boers had
discovered the most vulnerable points
of the garrison and that shelling was
becoming disagreeably offective. The
rations had been reduced and there was
a great deal of sickness. Nevertheless,
the troops of the garrison were in every
way preparing to meet the assault
which it was anticipated the Boers
would carry out in a
Final effort to Reduce the City.
The belief was current in Ladysmith
that the Boers were preparing for a ret
rograde movemement after another at
tack. Several bodies of burghers were
reported to have been seen Nov. 38,
moving in the direction of the Drakens
burg range, while, Nov. 29, detach
ments were observed journeying north
ward with the wagons. Discord be
tween the Transvaalers and Free Staters
was also reported. There was no indi
cation, however, that the Boers were
preparing to dismantle their gun posi
tions, but the idea was prevalent in
some quarters of Ladysmith that the
continued shelling of the place was in
tended to cover the retirement of other
Boer forces towards the Transvaal
frontiers.
The Pretoria dispatch (of Saturday,
Dec. 2, via Lorenzo Marques, Monday,
Dec. 4) however, announced that a Boer
council of war Dec. 2, was planning a
renewed assault on Ladysmith.
A dispatch from Frere, dated Sun
day, Dec. b, reported that in Colonel
Lord Dundonald's reconnaisance near
Colenso, 15 Boers were killed and a
number injured. The road bridge across
the Tugela river is intact.
The same message reports that Presi
dent Kxuger is anxious that the burgh
ers leave Ladysmith in order to oppose
the British marching in the direction of
Pretoria from the west.
Advices from Putter's Kraal, the
headquarters of General Gatacre's di
vision, dated Saturday, Dec. 2, say the
Boers entered Bordonecht that mom
ing. This, it is added, is probably
Groebler's force of 1,500 men from
Stormburg.
JOUBERT INDISPOSED.
Uoer oinwander at Volksrust for Med
ical Attention.
PRETORIA., Saturday. Dec. 2.(via
Lorenzo Marques, Monday, Dec. 4.)
General Joubert is indisposed and has
arrived at Volksrust, across the Trans
vaal border, for medical treatment.
A dispatch from the head laager,
where General Schalkburger is in su
preme command during the absence of
General Joubert, announces that a coun
cil of war will be held Dec. 2, with ref
erence to assaulting Ladysmith. The
state attorney has arrived at the camp
to advise the Boer commanders. Every
thing is quiet at Ladysmith.
Dispatches from the west report that
there was a heavy artillery duel at
Mafeking during the morning of Dec. 2.
All is quiet at Kimberley.
Comfortable wooden and iron houses
have been erected at Waterfall, a few
miles from Pretoria for the rank and
file of the British prisoners.
Count Deville le Blois, a colonel in
the French army, has joined the Trans
vaal forces as an authorized miltary at
tache.
FIRING HIGH EXPLOSIVES.
Boers Evidently Have Secured a Better
Brand of Shells.
N EW YORK, Dec- 7.A dispatch to
The Tribune from London says: While
the war office has received intelligence
that Mafeking was safe on Nov. 23, it
was admitted that the investment there
was closer than ever. This was con
firmed by the Pall Mall Gazette corre
spondent, but Router's dispatch one day
later showed that the Boers are using
new shells, filled with a high explosive,
fired from a 10-ton gun, and that the
Situation is serious.
General Yule In Broken Health.
LONDON, Dec. 7.The Daily Mail an

EFFECTIVE AT LONG RANGE.
Boer Fire at Modder River the Hottest
on Beoord.
LONDON, Dec. 7. The censorship
continues to be of the strictest charac
ter. Virtually no news is allowed to
pass except the details of events in the
beleaguered garrisons and nearby points.
From all accounts the Boer fire at
Modder River was the hottest on rec
ord and will revolutionize existing the
ories. It was effective up to 1,000
yards, but the casualties among the
prostrate troops was trifling. It was
found impossible to bring the British
ammunition reserves to the firing line.
Many Boers wearing red cross badges
were actually employed in serving out
ammunition.
The Morning Post learns there are
plenty of cavalrymen available at
home, but that parsimony prevents
their being sent to South Africa, where
they are urgently needed.

RACINE, Wis., Dec. 7.Rev. D. B.
Cheney and his wife were shot and
probably fatally injured by a burglar
who entered their home at 1 o'clock a.
m. At the point of a revolver they
were compelled to turn over money

were endeavoring to conceal some val
uables, the burglars shot them both
and escaped.

at the head of the Wisconsin A. P. A.
He came here from Superior five years

LONDON COMMENT.
President's Message a Topic of Consider
able Interest.
LONDON, Dec. 7.The amount of
space devoted here to President Mc
Kinley's message to congress evidences
the widespread interest in the docu
ment. The afternoon papers, in long
editorials on the subject, particularly
refer to the currency declarations and
solace themselves with the idea that
good relations between the United
States and Great Britain are so well
known as not to have required empha
sis, as in the case of Germany.
The Pall Mall Gazette sees in the
message an unmistakable reproof of
Mr. Chamberlain's Leicester speech.
Germans Approre the Messege.
BERLIN, Dec. 7. The message sent to
congress by President McKinley has
been most sympathetically received by
newspaper and government circles in
Germany. This is especially true of the
foreign office, one Of the highest officials
of which told the Associated Press rep
resentative that the document has made
a splendid impression.

Canvass'Made Friends Reveals
an Apparent Majority4a
His Favor*'
Petition of Pennsylvania Legisla
tors to Be Vigorously Used
Against Him.
Chairman Tayler Calls a Meeting
to Consider the Case of
Roberts.
NEW YORK, Pec. 7. A special to The
Herald from Washington says:
As a result of a canvass made by Mr.
Quay's friends, since the senate con
vened, it is asserted that 46 of the 85
senators will vote to seat him as sena
tor from Pennsylvania. These figures
are obtained by counting the 30 senators
now in the senate who voted either for
Corbett or Mantle and 16 others from
whom it is asserted promis.es have been
obtained favorable to Mr. Quay.
Senator Chandler has called a special
meeting of the committee on elections
to consider the case of Mr. Quay.
As a vacancy exists on the committee,
however, and the two parties are ar
ranging for the reorganization of all
the committees, it is not believed the
Quay case will be disposed of until the
committee has been reorganized.
The fact that a majority of the Penn
sylvania legislature, Republicans and
Democrats, have petitioned th senate
against the seating of Mr. Quay will be
used for all its worth by his opponents,
and the contest will be bitter and long.
HEARING FOR ROBERTS.
Representative Taylor Calls a Meeting
off His Committee.
WASHINGTON, Deo. 7.Representa
tive Tayler of Ohio, chairman of a spe
cial committee to investigate the case
of Mr. Roberts of Utah, has called a
meeting for the committee at 11 o'clock.
Mr. Tayler says the initial meeting will
be to determine upon a general line of
action. He could not say how soon the
committee would be ready to report.
While the chairman would not speak
for the committee, he said he had no
doubt that Mr. Roberts could be al
lowed to be present with counsel if he
desired and would be afforded the full
est facilities to have his side presented.
Mr. Roberts was about the house
during the day. There was no session
and he was engaged most of the time
in chatting with groups of members
and visitors who showed a friendly dis
position toward him.

emphatic resolutions against such a
policy and provided for a vigorous cam
paign in behalf of their desires.

ant Postmaster General Perry Heath,

this ruling hereafter will have to call

r. PAUL, Dec. 7.The fourteenth
annual report of the state grain inspect
tlon department for the year ending
Aug.JIM, ha& "been transmitted to1
the
railroad artd warehouse commissidn by
Chief Inspector Reishus. The report
shows that more wheat, corn and fuw
seed was received than during any jpre
jvious year. There is a considerable
falling off \n oats, rye and barley, a
jfact ^hich is dne largely to the diver
sion of this traffic to Chicago, Milwatu
kee and St. Louis, where the largo
brewing establishments are located.
Agents have bought direct from the
farmers. The total number of Oars re
ceived at Minnesota terminals during
the period of this report exceeded the
highest nuifcber received in any pre
vious year 0^26,807.
The presen^season's crop, that for the
orop year beginning Sept. 1,1899, prom-'
ises to be more difficult than usual to
grade, by reason of the heavy fall rains
which affected a large part of the crop,
and rust and blight which visited cer
tain grain-growing sections.
DEMORALIZING TO RATES.
Or eat Northern and Other Lines Said to
Have Joined In a Cut.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.A special to The
Record from Sioux City, la., says:
W. B. MoNader, traffic manager for
the Sioux City and Northern railroad,
announces that that road and the Great
Northern, its northern connection,
would join with the Soo line and Cana
dian Pacific in making a first class rate
for passengers to Ne York which
would be $4 less than the rate via Chi
cago and the Eastern roads. This move
on the part of the Hill roads, railway
men say, will so demoralize the passen
ger business eastbound that a serious
rate war may result. For the present
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul,
Illinois Central and Northwestern will
not meet the cut and will continue to
sell through tickets to New York for
$28.75, while the Great Northern makes
a rate of $24.97.
JRON ORE IN IOWA.

ES MOINES, Dec. 7.The recent an
nouncement of the discovery of an im
mense deposit of valuable iron ore in
Northeastern Iowa has attracted much
attention to the mineral possibilities of
that part of the state. The state geo
logical survey has long ago declared
that they are of great value and in time
tfrill unquestionably be developed. The
Allamakee county deposit, which is
now being carefully investigated by
representatives of the Illinois Steel
company, is believed to be one of the
richest west of the Allegheny moun
tains. Experts who have examined it
say that there is in sight, on an area of
about 350 acres of land, fully 50,000,000
tons of ore, from 30 to 50 per cent pure,
and averaging considerably above 40
per cent.
