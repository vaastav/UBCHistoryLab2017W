SIR HENRY
BLOSSE TALKS
A Cultured Irishman Tells
of Affairs on the
Old Sod.
Failure of the Kelp Crop and
% Popularity of Home
Eule.
Government "Will Soon Give Employ
ment to the Suffering
Poor.
Sir Henry Lynch B'osse of County Mayo,
Ire and, arrived at the Palace last night.
He is a splendid specimen of physical
manhood, standing six feet and four
inches and weighing nearly 300 pounds.
He is a university man of fine address and
courteous manners, speaking fluently on
affairs of Ireland and the world.
•'The failure of the kelp crop is hurting
us now," he said, "but no serious barm
can come to the people, because the Gov
ernment will set ihe unemployed at work
in Donegal *.n January."
According to him the most important
question before the country, is that of
home rule, which, he says, all classes
/'wor. The new measure gives home rule
f m about everything, except the police.
' The educational qualification is gener
y ally popular.
"The centennial will not be much of an.
affair," h? said, "because the bishops anil
a.cnbishops were against it from the start.
They have had a treat deal of influence.
Of course, there will bs a great many
people there, but the proportions of the
celebration have been greatly curtailed by
the opuo-ition of the clergy."
Sir Henry says there has not been much
stir over the discovery of gold in the
Yukon country, though he thinks he will
go to that country in the spring. He will
be in the city a lew days, after which he
will return to Ireland. The cmel puipose
of his visit to America at this season was
to see his mines in Montana.
PRAISED McKIIsLEY.
Iter. William Katlcr Approves of tho
I'reiulent's Itecent Message.
Rev. William Rider's subject at the
Third Congregational Church last even
ing was "The Moral Problems Before the
American Congress."
He said in part: "The Congress occu
pies a unique place in the kingdom of
God. No priest or preacher, with his
limited constituency, hai such an oppor
tunity io do good as a United States Sen
ator. It is as important that the question
of our relation to Spain and Hawaii and
England be rightly adjusted as that the
Mosaic authority of the Peniateuch be
dogmatically decided. We cannot divorce
the secular irom the sacred.
"President McKinley's message is con
servative and statesmanlike. While he
has touched upon some domestic prob
lems, such as the gold reserve and civil
service reform, he deals for the most part
with our relations with others.
"This messaee is greeted with a return of
prosperity, with more furnaces blazing,
stacks smoking and employed men man
a year ago. The tariff will not agitate this
Congress."
Concerning the Cuban question he re
ferred tj the history 01 the Spanish
atrocities.
"There are three propositions before
Congress," he said. "First, to declare a
ate of war; second, to declare for Cuba's
freedom, and third, to give Spain more
lime. This last is the President's policy,
which will not probably be adhered to."
The speaker advocated the annexation
of Hawaii and he approved McKinley's
position on arbitration.

The managers of the theaters state that
their policy will be to Rive the pub first

an interview with Jdanaaers Gottlob and

"At the California we will continue to

Tne policy of the Columbia Theatre Will

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1897.
NO "LITTLE
WHITE CZAR"
The Civic Rights Party 1
Strenuously Opposes a .
Despotic Charter.
Objects to the One-Man Power
Principle and Cites Pre
cedents.
J. Munsell Chase Tells Why Other
Cities Have Rejected the Idea
of an Autocratic Mayor.
Registration for the charter election on
December 27 closed on Saturday night
and aiscussion on the proposed new in
strument is now in order.
One of the most persistent of the many
associations now in open opposition to
the attempt to fasten an autocratic gov
ernment on .San Francisco is the Civic
Rights party, an offshoot of the Civic
League, which has assumed the task of
furthering all desirable forms of municipal
activity. The Civic Rights party early
declared its antagonism to the programme
of Mr. Phelan's Committee of One Hun
dred, and some of its criticisms have, been
productive of changes in the work of that
body, but the Civic Right* people are as
aggressive as ever, and declare that with
their approval no charter shall be adopted
which withdraws from the citizens any of
their present powers. They declare that
the remedy for the present defects in
municipal administration is the adoption
of a form of administration which shall
secure to the people a more direct and
continuous control of their affair-.
While the Civic Rights people do not
expect to make an active canvass in be
half of any candidate or set of candidates
in the election for ireeholders, they have
Leen making a careful canvass of the per
sonnel and principles of the candidates
now before the electors with the purpose
of enabling their members to vote intelli
gently, nnd they expect to have consider
able influence on the result of the cam
paign.
J. Munsell Chase, who has taken an
active interest in the work of the Civic
Bights par'y, was interviewed yesterday
in reference to the purposes of himself
and associaie-. He said:
"I am gad that the question has at last
been placed squarely before the citizens of
San Francisco: 'Do you want a charter
which shall make of the Mayor an auto
crat?' lor now we can expect to receive so
definite an answer that no future attempt
at charter- kin.; will include the one-man
idea as the central principle. Three of
the four rejected charters were defeated,
as 1 believe, chl* lly because they gave too
much authority to the Mayor. Let us
hope that we will not have to defeat an
otner: but l am certain the citizens o!
San Francisco will do so if the freeholders
whom lhey are about to elect propose
such a charter as ihe Committee of One
Hundred iias prepared.
"'I he Call has well styled tho Mayor,
as proposed by that committee, 'The Lit
tle White Czar.' for that is what he yon Id
actually be. With the Fire, I'ark, Folic?.
Lection and Civil Service commission*
and the Board of Public Works (Street
Department, etc.) in his appointment, th •
M a vor would soon become his Imperial
Majesty, and the people's protests against
bis acts would be a protest io the wind.
"That this result would follow does not
depend ior confirmation on empty theory.
Several cities have their Lord Mayors, and
no good to the peopie has come of it,
"The Mayor of Chicago is an autocrat,
yet, despite the fact that the Legislature
of the soverign State of Illinois lias en
acted a law and the Council of the great
State of Chicago an ordinance prohibiting
gambling, 'the gaming hell, open and un
abashed, is one of the indigenous institu
tions of Chicago.' So wrote W. T. Stead,
the eminent London editor, who visited
Chicago in the winter of 1834-95.
"What was the reason of this open vio
lation of the laws of the city of Chicago
and oi the State of Illinois? It was be
cause the Mayors of that city — Mayor
Harrison and his successor. Mayor Hop
kins — had made a compact with tn*»
gamblers to leave their hells undisturbed.
"Mr. Siead says: "Before Mr. Harrison's
last election a ceitain number of gamb
ler*, as is the custom in this city, made
up a purse and subscribed several thou
sand dollars (authorities differ as to the
precipe amount) to Mr. Harrison's elec
tion fund. When he was elected he took
steps to recoup those patriots who had
supplied the sinews of war. A small
syndicaie was formed for the purpose of
securing a certain liberal percentage of
the profits of gaming, and in return
practical immunity from prosecution was
secured to the gaming houses by an ar
rangement with the mayor. The precise
amount of this fund was not made
known, though it was estimated at 65 per
cent of the winnings of the gambler-*, but
many people had a finger in ti.e pie be. ore
the residue reached the Mayor.'
"When Mr. Hop Kins became mayor he
caused the Chief of Police to close every
gaining house until a new compact was
made, when everything went on as be
fore.
"I don't believe San Francisco has any
need for any 'Little White Czar,' and what's
more I don't think her citiz'ns will adopt
any charter which provides for one, cs
that of tne Committee of One Hundred
does."

LIGHT MAY GO
FROM BOTH EYES
What a Local Oculist
Thinks of Mrs. Oelrichs'
Condition.
Inflammation May Cause Total
Blindness Through
Sympathy.
Among the Various Remedies Is
One That Mrs. Pettee Says
Is Unfailing.
The many friends ot Mrs. Herman Oel
richs in this city are very much worried
over tho serious condition of her eye. The
■li ache- from New York --ay that she
nas superintending the hanging of some
draperies when a rusty tack fell, striking
Ivsr in the eye, the point piercing the
white. She said nothing to her husband
of the accident, but louk the precaution of
bathing her eye ln warm water. That
evening she went to a party and, it is pre
sumed, took cold. All that night she suf
fered tbe severest pain, which became so
bid in the morning that Dr. Knapp was
called in. Since then bulletins of the
most alarming nature have been reaching
her friends here from time to time.
On the 7th Richard V. Dey sent a dis
patch to Mr. Oelrichs asking the exact
condition of Mrs. Oelrichs' eye. On the
Oth he received an answer stating tnat her
condition was .very serious, but nothing
definite could bo known till Saturday.
Eirly yesterday morning Miss Jennie
Blair, who is a great friend of Mrs. Oel
richs, received the followine dispatch:
"Nothing definite for forty-eight hours."
At noon yesierday John Mackay sent the
following dispatch to Mr. D.*y: "Mrs.
Oelrichs not feeling well by any means.
Her eyes give her great pain, and they are
mucb worried about her."
Dr. John Boyson, one of the best known
oculists in the city, speaking of the mat
ter yesterday, Mid : "Judging from what
1 have reai I think it i** extremely proba
ble tnat Mrs. Oelrichs will lose the sight
of one eye if not ot both. If the tack pierced
the zone that lies bscK or the clear part oi
the eye and infected it with its poison, nat
urally a violent inflammation would be the
result. The papers say that erysipelas set
in and that little tumors are forming. In
this case the other eye acting in sympathy
with the injured one will also very likely
become affected and it may result in the
loss of both eyes."
All orts of queer remedies have been
offered for the relief of Mrs. Oeinchs.
Mrs. Kate Pettee, who lives on Leaven
worth street, offers this remedy: "Take
some ripe cranberries and stew them.
Then mat* a thin poultice and place it
over the afflicted eye. Relief is sure to
follow and in almost every case a care has
been effected. It is an old German rem
edy, If Mrs. Oelrichs can only be per
suaded to try this simple remedy I am
sure she will benefit by it."
NEW YORK, Dec. 12. At the Oelrichs'
residence reports have been given out the
past few day* that Mr 3. Oelrichs' condi
tion was improving. The . World, how
ever, prints the following this morning:
"Mrs. Hermann Oelrichs is threatened
with total blininess. Her left eye was
wounded on Saturday, D-camb^r 4, and
within the last forty-eight hours the con
dition of both eyes has become most seri
ous and alarming. There is bope of
course that her eyesight may b* pre
served to her. Dr. Knapp, the famous
oculist, and two other physicians are
treating her, and three trained nurses are
in attendance.
Hermann Oelrichs has been constantly
by his wife's hedside, and yesterday many
of their friends called and solu*itou-ly in
quired as to her condition. Mr. Oelrichs
told a friend Inst night that one of his
wife's eyes is badly ulcerated and that the
other is sympathetically affected and use
less, for the present at least. To-day will
determine whether this charming matron
will be spared the affliction of blindness,
She has youth, strength and perfect
health on her side. A consultation of the
most eminent oculists and surgeons will
be held at Mr. Oelrichs' house, and they
will decide whether or not his wife's sight
can be preserved to her.

Two men were ar.esed at an early hour

THAT AWFUL
NINTH INNING
It Was Then That Mos
kiman Was Found ior
. Nine Hits.
Op to That Fateful Time It
Looked All Eeliance's
Way.
A Hotly Contested Game of Ball,
Pull of Interesting
Features.
Moskiman, for Reliance, twirled great
bill up to the first half of the ninth
inning, and it looted very strongly as if
the aggregation from across the bay would
win — In fact, a conservative man would
have wagered a claim on the Klondike
against a plugged dollar when Harvey
went to the bat that Reliance would be
the victor. Tnere was something about
Harvey's appearance that disconcerted
Moskiman. What it was no one in the
grand stand was able to ascertain. Moski
man became as wild as a plains hare
when pursued by dig-) at Merced. Harvey
walked to tils base and Nethercott came
to the plate. He, too, trotted to first, be
ing given a base on balls. E. Hughes hit
to second and Nethercott was forced at
that bag, two men being out, Walker, the
first man up, having flown to Mclntyie.
Now, just at this stage of the proceed
ings "Kid" Peeples commenced the fusil
lade and the ball was sent to all parts of
the grounds. I'eeples caucht the sphere
on the trade mark for a iwc-bacger, it
gome into the right garden, Harvey eros -
ing the plate and tying the score. There
was nothing mild or charitable about
what followed. It was as unlike the truce
between Chief of Police Lees and Judge
Campbell as arctic night is to the noon
day sun of the tropics. Stanley dupli
cated Teenies' fear, planting the ball in
center field. J. Hug! es, not to be out
done, lammed a two-bagger into left gar
den. Lockt.cjd whanged out a s ngle to
left and Shanahan sent a low, sizzling
grounder into Van Haltren's territory for
a base. Walker, Harvey and Nethercott
also nindii singles. K. Hughes ended the
cannonading by drlvin" one at Lange and
was retired at tirst. Light runs snd nine
base bits were the record of the slaughter.
The contest between Reliance and Gilt
Edge yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park until the awful ninth recorded was a
great exhibition of the national game. I :
was full of brilliant plays. Gilt E Ige had
a strong team in the field. The elongated
Hennessey at first, a familiar figure and
great player, was missing, Shanahan hold
ing down the initial cushion for the visit*
! ors.
J. Hughes, Sacramento's great twirler,
brought down from the Capital City a
choice lot of puzzling deliveries, and he
kept the men irom across the bay guess
ing. Hugnes struck out seven men. and
was only found for three base hits. Stan
ley received his delivery, and as usual
caught a great game, being credited with
ten putouts, one assist and one error.
Pteples i.layed third for Git Edge and
carried off the honors of the day at tbe
bat. Five times up he made three base
hit ?, two of which were two- baggers.
Lance, third baseman for Reliance, put
up his usually excellent game. In the
first half of the sixth inning he made a
pnenom nal catch, stopping a scorcher i
from L.cklicad's bat with one hand and
relieving the runner at first.
.norland, who in the opinion of The
Call equals Van Haliren as a fielder, put
up a great game on the left garden. In
the first half of the third he made a re
markable running catch of a bsl! from Jo
Hugnes' bat, which waaloudly applauded.
In the last half of the eighth as pretty
a double as ever was seen on the grounds
was made. Van Haltren was given a base
on balls. Riley hit to center for a cushion.
Van Hi.itren scoring on the play and
Riley going to third on Harvey's error.
Lmge hit to Sbanahan, who quickly sent '
the ball to Stanley, retiring Riley at the
plate. Stanley threw the ball to Sbana
han. heading off Lange.
A remarkable thing happened in the
first half of the eighth inning. Mos
kiman sent three balls over tbe plate, re
tiring three batters. J. Hughes bit the
first nail and died at first on an assist by
Lange. The second ball Mas struck by
Lockhead, who flew to Borland and Shan
a ban hit the third and was out at first on
an assist by Lange.
