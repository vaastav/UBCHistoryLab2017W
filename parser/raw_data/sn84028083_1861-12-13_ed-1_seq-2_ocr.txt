Only a mixed nd not a dutinct class. No
principle stated is disturbed by the existence
of th',4 mixed class. Again, as lias
already been said, there ts not of necessity
iny such thing as the free hired laborer
)eing fixed ia that condition for life.
dMany independent men everywhere
these Slates, a few years back in their
lives, were hired laborers. The prudent,
penniless beggar in the world labors for
wages awhile, and eaves a surplus with
which t buy tools or Jnnd for himself,
then labors on his own account, and
length hires another new beginner
liclp him. This is the just, and generous,
and prosperous system which opens the
"way to all, gives hope to all, and conse
quent energy, progress and improvement
f the condition of all. No men living
re more worthy to be trusted than those
who toil up or on from poverty, none, less
inclined to take or touch aught arhich they
have not honorably earned. Let them
fcewsreof surrendering a political power
winch they already poeos3, ana which
surrendered will surely be used to cloee
the door of advancement against such as
they, Mid to fix new disabilitius and bur
dens upon them till all of liberty shall be
lost.
From the first taking of our national
census to the last, are 70 years, and we
find our population at the end of the pe
riod eight limes as great as it was at the
beginning. The increase of those other
tninjis which men deem dosirable, has
been even greater. We thus have at one
view what the popular principle applied
to the government through the ma
chinery of the Slates, and the Union
lias produced in a given time, and also
what if firmly maintained it promises for
the future. There are already among
ua those who, if the Union be preserved,
will live to see :l contain S'jO.OOO.uoo
The struggle of to-day is not altogether
lor to-cay, it is lor a vast future also.
With a firm reliance in Providence.Bll the
more firm and earnest let us proceed
the great tank which events have de
volved us.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 3, 1861.
Report of Capt. Wilkes.
Tho following is an abridged copy of the
report of Capt. Wilkes, assigning his reason
for tho arrest of Mason and Slidoll :
U. S. STEAMER SAN JACINTO,
At Sea. Nov. 16. 1861.
Tho governments of Ureal Britain, Franco
nno Spain having issued proclamations that
tho Confederate Stoles wore viewed, con-sido.-od
and t routed us belligerents, I foil no
hesitation in bearding and starching all
vessels of whatuver uuliun I loll iu with,
null 1 liavo done sn.
Tho niiostion arose in mv miml wh.,il,..
I had tho right to capture the persons
uu commissioners, wnolliur they woro ame
nable to capture. There was no doubt iliut
i nao. uio right to capture vessels with writ
ten dispatches.
They aro oxprossly referred to in all an
tborities, subjection the vessel to uiimn.
and condemnation if the Captain of the
vessel had the knowledge of their being
board. But those gentlemen wore not dis
patches in the literal sonso, and no where
couiu j II nil a case in point.
Tboy had been presumed to tho Captain
General of Cuba by il B. M. Consul (Jon
oral, but tho Captain General told mo he
bud not received thorn in that capacity, but
as distinguished gentlemen and strungors.
1 thou considered them as ilio einbodi
rount of dispatches, and it therefore became
my duty to arrest their progress una cap
ture thuin if they had no passport or papers
from tbu Fedunil (Jovorninont, as pro
vided for under ihuluv ol uuiions; nutiioly,
that foreign ministers of a belligerent on
board of uoulrul ships, are required to
possess papers from tho other belligerent to
permit thum to puss free. As respects the
tuamer iu wbiuh they einbniked, tho agent
of tho vessel, the son of the British Consul
at ll.tvaim, was well aware of the character
of tbo pnrsous. They went in tho Btonmor
wilU the knowledge and consent of tho Capt
who ondeuvored uf forwards to ooi.coal thorn
by refusing to exhibit the pussuugor list und
the paper of the vessul. There can bo no
doubt he know they woro carrying highly
important dispatches and were endowed
with instructions Inimical to the United
Mutes. 1 his rendered his vessel, though
w" .!, a u'lgai iri0,
I determined to lake possession of the
vessel, and, as I mentioned in my report,
send her to Key West for abdication.
forebore to seise her, however, in conse
quence of my being so reduced in officers
and crew, and the derangement it would

Jarge number of passenger who would
have been put to ureal loss and inconven

interruption it would have caused them
in not being able to join the steamer from

eluded to sacrifice tho interests of mv

Although It bears evident marks of having

manifold and absorbing duties of thoEiccu

and businosS'like suggestions und general
good sense. We should prefer a dourer

cism, because it could do no good, simply
remarking that, if there is not much in tho
Mossngo that the pooplo, whoso seal In tho

Tho country will bo gra tifiod by tho as

The argument against the Southern doc-
trino that capital should own labor, with
which tho Mossngo concludes, Is clear and
unansworablo, and, in these tiinot of politi

The Louisville Journal, edited by
D, Prentice, has a shameful article on the
President's Message, which it pronounces
"deplorably unsatisfactory on the point
chief solicitude to the conservative men
of the conntry." It affects to find in the
Message, so moderate nod cautious, "in
direct and unmanly concurrence in the
policy asserted recently by Col. Coch
rane, and approved by Secretary Cfine
ron, to the mortification nnd shame
loynl men in Kentucky." After say in-'
that the President desires Congress
adopt extreme measures, it proceeds
the following style :
We thus havo beforo us the startling
fact thai within a few days or weeks the
President will be culled upon to decide
for or against the adoption of measures
which the conservative men of the country
deem utterly fatal lo tho re-estHtiliNimen
of our Government, and which he will con
sider wilh a biat favorable to their adop
tion. This is '.he plain truth, deny il who
may, and the revelation of this truth murks
the teal turning point in tho present mo
mentous struggle. Now, of all others,
the critical hour of American nationality.
Wlial is to bo done ? . There is but one
thing to be done. The adoption of the
ex'rome measures contemplated must
prevented, or Ihe nation is swallowed up.
Ol this we do r.ot feel a shadow of doubt.
Hut how enn the adoption of these meas
ures oe prevented if There appear lo
io oe iniee moues, in either ol which the
all important prevention may be attained.
I. The prosperity of our arms uud of our
cause generally in a degree that will put
all pretexts whatever for a resort to extreme
measures out of the question.
The awakening of the conservative sentiment
and enlightened loyally of the
country, and bringing boll: lo bear on the
President with a lorce which he cannot as
nn honest and rational man withstand.
3. The resolution of the Commander-in-
chief in the field, nnd of his principal as
sociates in. command, to surrender their
swords rather than link them wilh the in
famy of such measures. Tho first of these
three modes is for the most part beyond
the reach of the people. Wo have faith
in il, but it bhoulj not be relied on blindly.
Tho last mode ia our lust hope. When
everything else fails, this may save us.
If il does not, we are irretrievably lost as
a tmlion. This mode, though hardly be
yond the re-ch of tho people, is slid not
directly within their influence. The sec
ond mode is especially the people's own,
and through this mode we invoke Ihe
people lo pour their awakened euergies
with a spirit of lofty resolve llmt wiHnot
be put down or put aside. Wore ia the
sphere wherein ihe loyal masses of our
peoplo in this crisis of the nation's fule
can work effectually for tho national pres
ervation. We call them to the sublime
tusk.
The tusk can bo performed successfully.
Lot il be performed at every cost of en
ergy and of sacrilice. We would have
the Uenora! Assembly of Kentucky inau
gurnlo the imperative work, bv at once
protesting in loyal terms but explicitly and
uiupuauviiiiy against measures in content
puiion ijet this be done ; nnd let the
example be followed as promptly as pos
sible by Missouri and Maryland, and I)el
awtre and Western Virginia, and every
other Southern community, whether large
or small, ihat still owns the banner of our
country. Y uilhermore.lel the solemn pro
testations oe carried to Washington by
uuirKniiuus oi me most eminent and in
fluentiul citizens ol the respective onmmu
nilies, and bo urged upon the President
with nil Ihe weight of exalted character
and intelligence, seconded by the power
pei&ouui presence. Let the loyal men
of ihe Souili rise up as one man, and tell
the President he knows not whnl he does.
Il is now plain to every
candid observer that the President must
either break with ihe extreme men ol his
parly, or saaibce ihecounlry lo their fa
natical measures. Oue or the oilier is in-
viiahle. The message shows that the
President is not disposed tc. break wilh
the extreme men of his parly. He wauts
perhaps both the sagacity and Ihe nerve.
Something he certainly wants. Whatever
it may be, the firm, full, healthful, as
suring, overruling voice of the people will
supply it. Let that voioe be heard.
Our sense of the actual
peril is most deep and vivid. If we sup.
pressed or disguised it we should bo false

This article, coming from so able and
influential a Bource, is entitled to more
than ordinary consideration. It shows
this alarming slate of facts : that, with
the "neutrality" Unionists of Kentucky,
whom tho Journal represents, conserva
tism nnd devotion to Slavery are one and
the same thing ; that they are so thor
oughly demoralized by Slavery as to re
gard its safety and continuance as an ob
ject far more important llian the preser
vation of tho Government ; that they
cling lo the Union solely because they
hope that Slavery will be perpetuated in
it, nnd, that hope failing, will not hes
itate to cost their lot with traitors.
The Journal, as a last resort, lo pre
serve Slavery, would have every officer
in the service surrender his sword I If
there are any officers, high or low, in the
service, who, like the Journal,ove Slavery
better than their country, it is high time
their swords were surrendered to worthier
hands. If the preservation of the Union
depends upon the will of a few men whose
hearls are with the traitors, its doom is
sealed, and any further sacrifices in its be
half will be worse then vain. The Jour

CAMP PIERPONT, McCall's Division.
CAMP PIERPONT, McCall's Division. Army of the the Potomac. Fairfax.
Co., Va., Dec. 5th, 1861.
Mr. Editor: At the date of my last
letter, it was generally thought an engage
ment of the forces here concentrated would.
ero this, proclaim what is to be the destiny
ol our country. In this our expectations
liavo nnt boon real nod. Two months have
intervened since that date, and now, as then,
the llobuls.tbii sting for loyal blood to avonge
fancied wrongs and gratify ambitious do
signs, prowl with Impunity near our Na
tional Capital. We are now, if pnisiblo,
more intricately involved in an awful war
than Ihon. Neglect to redress froquont
grievances has inspired in tho enomy hopo
and courage. As nno passes through tho
several divisions of this army, and beholds
Ihe country spotted with the whito tonts
of soldiers, he wonders why the Stars and
Stripes do not now wave over Richmond
He asks himself why must winter open upon
sn many soldiori on Iho tented field, so
North? There Is a force bore collected,
armed , drilled, In every way qualified, with
numbers, confidence and courage sulliciont
to conquer tho world besides, arrayed
against us in such an unjust and unholy
cuuso as mat ol our enomy. Uut
shiver, and slumber, and await the order,
"Forward, march I" No one will blamo tho
American volunteer soldier for growing
littlo impatient at so long protracted lean
tivity, The idea of so long living in tents
deprived of the privileges and benefits
sooioty, only to swell the numbor of an no
casionul "grand review," and soini occasion
ally lo stand his turn of pickot guard in iho
cold rains and chill frosts of a Southern
December night, without sloop, without
cover, to prevent iho surprise of an idle
army, and lo prohibit travol in this con
tomptihle, depopulated land, is not at
compatible wilh his previous education
But wo must not complain. Wo would not
Tho good soldier never murmurs. But wc
musi confess that wo do mil liko it, thut
this army, this Vrand Jinny of the Potomac,

divisions, not nominally so grand, have ae
com pi is hod grander aliievemimts,aiid done
more to socuro tho end lor which wo all on

Country's cause. We think our titno will
come by and by, and welcome it is. May
God speed the day wnon everything shall
bo ripened for the harvest.
McCall's division is camped at Langlny,
little town five miles west of Chain Bridgn.
on the Georgetown and Luesburgh turnpike
road. Close on tho south is Gen. Smith's
division; a littlo south east of his is Gun
Porter's division) south east of his is Gun.
Buitorfield s division, which is on Hall's
Iliil, near Palls Church. Who is south
bun I do not know, hut the country, I am
lotu, is covered wun soldiers bs far as Alex
andi ia. t roin throo to fivo miles in front
of theso divisions is the lino of pickets the
line which utvuios Constitutional liberty
from anarchy. Fmm our division each
Iho three brigades sends oot daily two com
pamea tor picKOi ouiy. inoy report
tho lino at four o'clock A. M. The com
panies which thov relievo do not start for
camp until sunrise, which leaves a double
nirce oi picKots on Iho lino at tho time
when au attack would bo most likely to
mauo.
ji ia'.o, our pickets navo boon snmo-
what harrassed. Two of our sentinels wore
shot night before last. Thoy have been visiting
tho woods near our line, lor aomo days past.
i nu uiuuruiri irom mo nuoois approacHud
tho lino a few days ago, and were blind folded
and led lo head quarters. They cnmpluinou
of hard lure. A Regiment of our cuvalry went
on a reconnoisanco to uruinsviite recently
and, when returning, woro suprisod by
party or iiouets in ambusn. Thoy sur
rounded tho woods and took thirteen
them, one being mortally wounded. Tney
woro taken by our camp, wore poorly
clothod, aud no two dressed aliko. The
wounded ono just before his death said that
they woro umbushed thero for tho ournose
of killing Gen. McCall, whon on somo
his visits, which he frequently makes boyoud
tbe picket line.
The health of the soldiors is as good as
couiu uo oxpoetou. tlioso who are well
are very rugged. Neighboring houses,
which woro deserted upon our first approach,
aro uud for regimental hospitals. A flue
church, ownod by the M. E. Church South,
is used by our, the 10th Regimont. The
weather is pretty cool here for our manner
of living, but 1 luppnso much warmor than
in Old Guauga. There has boon slight
sprinkle of snow onco. Tho air seems lo
chill ono hero more than it does further
north. The soldiers have built small log
pons, threo or four foot high, and fastened
their tents nn top of these. In each tent
hole is dug in the ground for a fireplace,
rude chimney constructed on tho outside.
By keeping up a fire all night, and sleeping
at a "column closed rn matte," we keep
wurtn when asloop in our tonts.
Among Ihe funny things that ocour in
camp, wus tho bursting of a Secession sholl
the other duy. It had boon fired by the
Rebels when tboy occupied this ground. It
was picked up and brought into camp.
Some follow throw il Into a fire, over which
wore conking baans, lhat it might got hot.
after which he would throw it into his tent
lo warm it. It burst when Ihe fire was sur
rounded by soldiors. It covered all with
boans, seriously Injured throo, but killed
uono
Another singular circumstance occurred
in our Regiment a few days ago, to witt a
wedding. A private sent home tor his eirl ;
she camo, and they were married In camp.
The boys think he will now dosire lo devoto
his llmo to raising a oompany of infantry.
Congress has convened. We soldiors ox-
pool it will fight until it gets us deeper into
iruuuiu or nearor nut. liverv resolution
seems lo tend toward ihe mighty question
of emancipation. Let universal omanoipa
lion he proclaimed, and wo who are now in
Ihu field will fight until tho captive is set
free and the Union restored. Then, if wo
are permitted to return, we shall return
with the consciousness that we have accom
plished a noble and durable work i that wn
have reared unto our generation a monu
ment more enduring than marble or brass.
Then, too, will the dying hopo of Liberty
rekindle in tha hearts of down trodden pal
riots beyond the ooean. Yours,

the noonday sun, and a feeling of dread
passes llftough "your mind, as some grim
monarch of the forest, with outstretched
branches, seems, like some wizard in fairy
tale, intent upon clasping you in its lone
some embrace, and, hefote you have en
tirely regained your wonted composure,
the shrill whislle of the engine signals for
down brakes, and you are nearlv thrown
oft your feet by the sudden application
thereof, and, ete you are aware ni it, the
train has stopped, and you are at the
end of your journey.
Camp Dennison has been so often de
scribed that there is but little occasion for
me to say much in the description thereof,
but, at the present lime, a few words about
our quarters may not be uninteresting to
many of your readers, who have friends
and telatives here encamped.
Upon our arrival at the station, a most
dreary prospect opened to our view. Im
agine, if you can, a large flt, surrounded
by high hills upon every side, crowned by
stunted trees and underbrush, the fiat
itself dotted in every direction with tents
nnd rough board buildings in the shape of
barracks, with a nrge number of uni
formed men wading through mud (rom
the depth of the ankle lo the knee. Our
quarters are those used by the three
months men, and are ia a very dilapidated
contlition indeed. The bunks were all
down, and windows the whole length of a
board were plenty, while there were nu
merous skylights in the roof, through
which the sun shone most beautifully, and
rain and snow fell most plentifully. We
all set lo work, and have reduced the
windows (o a respeolful number, and have
blotted out all Ihe skylights, and now the
"chiebang" wears an nir of comfort that
makes us all cheerful, if not contented.
Since our arrival in this camp, there
has been a decided improvement iu our
provisions. During our stay at the Fair
Ground, we had salt pork served up lo
us, which, like "Bunquo's ghost," would
not go down, but, at every meal, we were
assured of its presence, both by taste and
smell. Burnt pets were dealt out for
coffee, nnd bread that was harder than the
head of a contraband, was daily dealt out
to us. For a long lime, we were nearly
destitute ol clothing, and we were so re
duced that some of the boys were in
daily expcotnlior. of being obliged to live
upon hay, nnd wear no clothing, except a
spur upon the left heel. Owing to ihe
bad quality of provisions served out to us,
many of Ihe boys were obliged to pur
chase their meals at the Sutler's, who fur
nishes them with checks in advance of
Iheir pay, redeemable in cooda at his
counter, for which he charges an enor
mous profit. 1 his is only one of the
many ways which are used by those in
power to take advantage of the brave vol
unteers, and do them out of their hard
earned wages. When pay-day cauio,
which it did as we were leaving ihe last
camp, the Sutler was the richest man in
the Regiment, many of the boys bavin"
. L! I I. .
spcin wnn mm nan ineir wages and some
more, vve were paid, on an avorage,
830 to each man.
Every man in tho Company enjoys
good health, there not being a man Irom
Co. G at present in the hospital. We ajl
think more of our officers as we net belter
acquainted wilh them, from the Captain
down to the 8th Corporal. We all honor
and respect ihem, and we do our best to
please them. Yours, &.,

The Union Victory in East Tennessee.
lbero seems to bo no doubt that a foren
of some 3 000 loyal EistTonnessoans, under
the illlloillltahlll IVrann n....,,l I,...
achieved a decisive victory over iho rebels
at Mofrrjstowii, Jetlorson county, East Ten
nessee, uxiracts irom a lute oopy of the
Memphis Appoul, which wo publish this
morning, confirm this intelligence trans
mitted hy telegraph.
Morristewn is about 45 milos from Knox
villo, in a Northeast direction, and about
the same distance in a d root lino from Cum
berland Gat). It is located on th
Tennessee und Virginia Railroad, whioh, at
that point, is now in the hands of thy Union
ists, who will, wo presume, not loavo it in a
condition to allow the transit of robe! forces.
I lie rebels are greatly exoitod by this
uprising of the palriotio mnn in that Stute,
and cry aloud for vongeanoo. Shall thoy bo
permitted to overwhelm and destroy those
patriotic men, who, weary-of waiting for
assistance, and groaning under the liurH.ma
of despotism, have undertaken the work of
inoir own uoltvoranco ? How long must our
Gonerals wtil for Iraiispnrlution.subsisteiice,
&c, before thoy wilt bo ready to move ? '
viucinnuii uommereiai.
ins ulacic f lao The affiir of tho
black D ig is thus alluded to by tbe Charles
Ion Courier of the 25lll i
War in its best eslato is war, and is hor
rible enough. If we must moot invader',
let us meet Ihem with all Iho mitigation
whioh invasion affords. To say that no
prisoners are to be taken under any cir
cumstances, is only lo proclaim a war of
extermination, in whioh both sidos will
sulfur uselessly. Tho cry of extermination,
black flag and no quurtor, is shouted most
vociferously by some who aro evading any
kind of war. Peoplo w! o fight aro willing
enough to aconpt a war of rules, as long us
possible, and if thoy oaten thievos and in
cendiaries, thoy can readily discriminate
agaiust them iu favor of prisoners of war."
2r"The Secretary of the Interior,
having learned lhat some gentlemen in
the Department have proposed to raise a
una lor the exec u iron of his bust ia mar
ble, desires to express his appreciation of
tbe intended compliment, while his sense of
propriety compels him to decline it :
Tbe unsettled condition of the country,
and tho sacrifice which patriotism de
mands of the people to enable the Gov.
eminent to suppress a rebellion whioh
threatens our national existence, sa,ems to
render inappropriate at Ibis lime contri
butions for personal compliment to those
engaged in ihe administration of the Gov

Tho bill also forfeits iho claims of all

Tho bill declares that slams thus forfoitod

The property belonging to traitors or to

Mr. Trumbull made a longthy argumont
in support of the bill. Tbo bill was ordered
to be primed and referred to Judiciary com

The British Government has not sent a
