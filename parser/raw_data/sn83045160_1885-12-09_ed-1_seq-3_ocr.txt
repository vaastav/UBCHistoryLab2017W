read before Congress to-day:
THE MKMtaUR.
To the CongreM of the United Statoa :
Your assembling is clouded by a sense
of public bereavement, caused by the re
cent Bod sudden death of Thomas A.
Hendricks, Vice-President of the
United States. His distinguished uub-
lio service, his complete integrity and
devotion to every duty, and his personal
virtues will find honorable record in Ins
country and history. Ample and repeated
proof's of the esteem and confidence in
which he was held by his fellow-countrymen
were manifested by his election
to offices ot tbe most important trust and
.highest dignity, and. Bt length, lull ot
vnara and honors, he has been laid at rest
amid universal sorrow and benedietiou.
The constitution, which requires
those chosen to legislate lor the people
onnnnllv meet in the discharge of
their solemn trust, also requires the
President to give to Congress inform:
tion of the state of the Union, and reo
unamend to their consideration such
measures as he "ball deem necessary
and expedient. At the threshold ot a
compliance with these constitutional '
directions, it is well for us to bear in
mind that our usefulness to the people's
interests will be promoted by a constant
-appreciation of the scope and character
-ot our iOpcctive duties as they will re
lato to Federal legislation. While tlie
Kxecutive mar recommend such meas
ures as he shall ieCfa expedient, the re
sponsibility for legmuuve action must
and should rest upon (hose sent
by the jeople to make their Jaws.
Contemplation of the grave and responsi
ble functions assigned to the executive
branches ol the government under :he
constitution, will disclose the partition
of power between our respective depart
ments, and their necessary independence,
and also the need for the excess ot all
power iutrusted to each that spirit of
vomity and co-operation which is essen
tial to the proper fulfillment ot the
patriotic obligations which rest upon us
as taithtul servants ot the people. The
jealous watchiulness of our constituencies
jreat and small, supplements their suf
frages, and before the tribunal they es
tablish every publio servant should be
judged.

A QUESTION V.. K.K1LV.

A question has aru .r toucuiDg the
ment ot Austria-uuiig -. jt4toj, at
representation oi toe t uu. -utution

ai prerogative, appoinivu nu csw-
citizen of unimiieachablc probity a..
competence as Minister at that Court,
the government of Austria-Hungary in
vite this government to cognizance of
certain exceptions, based upon allega
tions against the personal acceptibihty
ot Mr. Keily, the appointed envoy, ask
ing that in view thereof the appointment
should ba withdrawn. The reasons ad
vanced were such as could not be ao
quiesced in without violation of my oath
of office and the precepts of the constitu
tion, silica they necessarily involved a
f -. - T"
limitation in lavor ot a foreign govern
ment upon tbe right of selection by tbe
executive, and required such an applica
tion ot a religions test as a qualification
for office under the United States
as would have resulted in the Draotical
disfranchisement of a large class of our
citizens and tbe abandonment ot a vital
principle in our government. The Austria-
Hungarian government finally do-
cided not to receive Mr. Keilly as the
envoy or the United estates, and that gen
tleman has since resigned his commis
sion, leaving the post vacant. I have
made no new nomination, and the mter-
ests oi wis government at v lenna are
now in the care of the feeoretary of Lega
tion, acting as Charge D'Affairs ad in
terim. TBS WAR IS CENTRAL AMERICA.
Early in March last war broke put in
Central America, caused by the attempt
of Guatemala to consolidate the several
States into a single government. In these
contests between onr neighboring Stales
the United States forbore to interfere
actively, but by the aid of their friendly
offices in the deprecation of war, and to
promote peace and concord among the
belligerents, by such counsel con
tributed importantly to the restoration
of tranquillity in that looality.
OUR TROUBLE ON THE ISTHMUS AND THE
RESULT.
Emergencies growing out of civil war
in the United Siates of Colombia de
manded of the government, at the begin
ning of this administration, tbe employ
ment of an armed force to fulfill its
guarantees under the thirty-fifth article
of the treaty ot 1846, in order to keep
the transit open across the Isthmus of
Panama. Desirous of exercising only
the powers expressly reserved to us by
the treaty, and mindful of the rights ot
Colombia, the forces sent to the Isthmus
were instructed to confine their action to
positive ly and efficaciously preventi ng the
transit and its accessories from being in
terrupted or embarrassed. This delicate
and responsible task necessarily invelved
polioo control whare the looal authority
waS temporarily powerless, but always in
aid ot the sovereignty of Colombia. The
nromnt nnd UCCe.-Stul fulfillment Of its
duty by this government was highly ap
preciated by the government of Colom
bia, and has been followed P.r expres
sions of its satisfaction. High praise IB
due to the officers and men engaged in j
mis service, ine restoration oi peace
on the Isthmus by the re-establishment
of the constituted government there bej
ing thus accomplished, the forces of the
United States were withdrawn. Pend
ing these occurrences a question ot much
importance was presented by decrees of
the Colombian government, proclaiming
the closure of certain ports there in the
hands of insurgents, and declaring ves
sels held by the revolutionists to be pi
ratical and liable to capture by any
power. To neither of the propositions
could the United States assent. An ef
fective closure of ports not in the pos
session of the government but held by
hostile partisans could not be recognized.
j either could the vessels ot insurgents
against the legitimate sovereignty be
deemed hostiehumani generis within the
preoepts of international law, what
ever might be the definition and penalty
of their acts under the municipal law of
the State against whose authority they
were in revolt. The denial by this gov
ernment of the Colombian propositions
did not, however, imply the admission of
a belligerent status on the part of the in
surgents. The Colombian Government
has expressed its willingness to negotiate
conventions for the adjustment by arbi
tration of claims by foreign citizens
arising out of the destruction of the city
of. Aspinwall bj the insurrectionary
forces.
THE NICARAGUA TRANSIT SC3EXE.
Tbe interest of the United States in
practicable transit for ships across the
strip of land separating the Atlantic
from the Pacific has been repeatedly
manifested during the last half century.
My immediate predecessor caused to be
negotiated with Nicaragua a treaty for
the construction by and at the sole cost
of the United States, of a canal through
Nicaraguan territory, and laid it before
the Senate. Pending the actioo of that
body thereon I withdrew the treaty for
re-examination. Attentive considera
tion ot its provisions leads me to with
hold it from resubmission to the Senate.
Maintaining, as 1 do, the tenets ot a line
of Presidents from Washipgtou's day,
which proscribe entangling alliances
with foreign States, I do not favor a
policy of acquisition of new and distant
rritory or the incorporation of remote
interests with our own. Ihe laws ot
progress arJ vital and organic, ana we
must be conscious ot that irre
sistible of commercial expansion
which, as the ooncomitant of our active
civilization day by day, is being urged
onward by those increasing facilities ot
production, transportation and commu
nication to which steam and electricity
have given birth. But our duty in the
present instruct ! us to address ourselves
iiiaiuly to the development of the vast
resources of the great area committed to
our charge and the cultivation ot the
arts of peace within our borders, thourh
zealously alert in preventing the Ameri
can hemisphere from being involved in
the political problems and complications
of distant governments. Therefore, I
am unable to recommend propositions
involving paramount privileges ot own
ership or right outside yi' out own terri
tory when coupled with absolute and un
limited encasements to delend the terri
torial integrity of the State where such
interests lie.
THE TEUUANTEPF.C ROUTE.
While the general project ot connect
ing the two oceans by means of a canal
is to be encouraged, I am of opinion that
any scheme to that end to be considered
with favor should be free from the feat
ures alluded to. The Tehuantepcc
route is declared by engineers of the
highest rertute and by competent scient
ists to ahord an entirely practicable
transit for vessel's cargoes by means of
a ship "railway" from the Atlantio to
the Pacific The obvious advantages of
such a route, if feasible, over others
morn remote from the axial lines of
traffic between Europe and the Pacific,
and particularly between the valley of
the Mississippi and the western coast of
North and South America are deserving
of consideration.
WHATEVER HIilUWAY IS CONSTRUCTED
MUST BE FOR THE WORLD'S UoE.
Whatever highway may be constructed
across the barrier dividing the two great
est maritime areas of the world must be
tor the world s benefit a trust tor man
Lini to be removed from the chance of
domination by any single power, nor be
come an lnviwnou ior uosuuues or a
prizo for warlike ambition. An engage
ment combining the ooDstruc::on,owner
ship and operation ot such a wo.L bv
this government, with an onensivc uuu.
defensive alliance for its protection with
the loreigo States whose responsibilities
nd rights we would snare is, in myjuug-
ment, inconsistent with sueu dedication
to universal and neutral use, and would,
moreover, entail measures for its realiza
tion beyond the scope of our national
politics or present means, liie lapse oi
years has abundantly confirmed the wis
dom anu loresignt oi uiose earner uuiuiu
istrations which, long before the condi
tions of maritime intercourse were
changed and eularged by the
progress ot the age, proclaimed the
vital need of interoceanic transit
across the American isthmus and conse
crated it in advance to the common use
of mankind by their positive declarations
and through the lormal obligation of
treaties. Toward such realization the
efforts of my administration will be ap
plied, ever bearing in mind tbe princi
ples on which it must rest, and which
were oeciarea in uncertain tones uy m.
Cass, who, while Secretary of State in
1js58. announced that what the United
States want in Central America, next to
the happiness of its people, is the secur
ity and neutrality of the interoceanic
routes which load through it.
THE EFFECT AND VALVE OF OUR TRANS
CONTINENTAL RAILROADS.
The construction of three transconti
nental lines of railway, all in successful
operation, wholly within our territory
mnd uomnclie Atlantic and the t'acihc
oceans, have been accompanied by results
of a most lntcrestiocand impressive nat
ure, and has created new conditions, not
in the routes of commerce only, but in
political geography, which power fully
aflecta our relations toward and necessa
rily increase our interests in any trans
Isthmian route which may be opened
and employed for the ends of peace and
traffic, or, in other contingencies, for
uses inimical to both.
Transportation is a factor in the cost
of commodities scarcely second to that of
Ueir production, and weighs as heavily

gestions may serve to emphasixe what I
Lave already said on the xcore of toe ne-
cessity of a neutralization of any inter
oceanic transit, and this can only be ac
complished by making the uses of the
route open to all nations and subject to
the ambitions and warlike necessities of
none.
The drawings and report of a recent
survey of the Nicaragua Canal route,
made by Chief Engineer Menocal, will
be communicated for your information.
CLAIMS AGAINST CHILI, PERU AND BO
LIVIA. The claims of citizens of the United
States for losses by reason of the late
military operations of Chili in Peru and
Isolivia sre the subject ot negotiation
tor a claims convention with Chili, pro
viding for their submission to arbitra-
tion. The harmony of. our relations
with China is fully snstaiued in the ap
plication of the aots lately passed to ex
ecute the treaty of 1880, restrictive of
the immigration ot Chinese laborers into
the United States. Individual cases of
hardship have occurred beyond the
power of the Exeoutive to remedy, and
calling for judicial determination.
CHINA AND THE CHINESE LABOR QUES
TION. The condition of the Chinese question
in the Western States and Territories is,
despite this restrictive legislation, far
from being satisfactory. The recent
outbreak in Wyoming Territory where
numbers of unoffending Chinamen, in
disputably within the protection of the
treaties and the law, were murdered by
mob, and the still more recent threatened
outbreak of the same character in Wash
ington Territory, are fresh in the minds
ot all and there is apprehension lest the
bitterness of feeling against the Mongo
lian race on the Pacific slope may find
vent in similar lawless demonstration.
All the power of this government should
be exerted to maintain the amplest good
faith toward China in the treatment of
these men and the inflexible sternness
of the law in bringing the wrong-doers
to justice, should be insisted urton.
Every effort has been made by this gov
ernment to prevent these violent out
breaks and to aid the represen
tatives of China in their investi
gation of these outrages, and it is
but just to say that thev
are traceable to the lawlessness of men
not citizens of the United States en
gaged in competition with Chinese labor
ers. Race prejudice is the chief factor
in originating these disturbances, and
it exists in a large part of our domain,
jeoparding our domestic peace and the
good relationship we strive to maintain
with China. The admitted right of a
government to prevent the influx of ele
ments hostile to its internal peace and
security may not be questioned, even
where there is no treaty stipulation on
the subject. That the exclusion of Chi
nese labor is demanded in other coun
tries where like conditions prevail is
strongly evidenced in tbe Dominion ot
Canada, where Chinese immigration is
now removed bv laws more exclusive
than our own. If existing laws "are in
adequate to compass the end in view, I
shall be prepared to give earnest consid
eration to any further remedial measures
within the treaty limits which the wis
dom of Congress may devise.
THE CONGO FREE STATE.
The independent State of the Congo
has been organized as a government un
der the sovereignty of his majesty the
Kiugofthe Belgians, who assumes its
chief magistracy in his personal charac
ter only, without making the new Stste
a dependency on Belgium. It is fortun
ate that this benighted region, owing all
it has of quickening civilization to the
beneficence and philanthropic spirit of
this monarch, should have the advantage
and security of its benevolent super
vision. The action taken by this govern
ment last year in being the first to rcoog
nize the flag of the International Asso
ciation of the Congo has been followed
by a f-'rmal recognition of the new
nationality Wulcu succeeds to its sover
eign powers, a conrcrence oi aciegates
of the principal commercial nat;oDS was
held at Berlin last winter to discuss
methods whereby the Congo basin might
be kept open to the world s trade. JJele-
Sates attended on behalf of the United
states with the understanding that their
part sbonld be merely deliber
ative, without imparting to the
results any binding character so
far as the United States were
concerned. This reserve was due
to the indisposition of this government
to share in any disposal by an interna
tional congress of jurisdictional questions
in reaiote foreign Territories. The rj
sults of this conference were embodied
in a formal act of the nature of an inter
national convention, which laid down
certain obligations purporting to be bind
ing on the signatories, subject to ratific i
tion within one year, and, notwithstand
ing the reservation under which the del
egates o' the United States attended,
their statures were attached to the
geceral act in tiie same manner as those
of the plenipotentiaries C'f other govern
ments, thus making the United States
appear, without reserve or qualification.
as signatories to a joint international en
gagement imposing upon the signors the
conservation ct the territorial integrity
ot distant regions where we have no es
tablished interests or eontrol. This gov-.
ernment does not. however, regard its
reservation of liberty of action in
the premises as at all impaired,
and holding that an engagement to
share in the obligation of enforcing
neutrality in the remote valley of the
Congo would be an alliance whose re
sponsibilities we are not in a position to
assume, I abstain from asking the sanction
of the Senate to that general act. The
correspondence will be laid belore you,
&nd Ihe instructive and interesting report-
of the aent sent by this govern
ment td the Cob go uountry, and his
recommendations for the establishment
of commercial agencies on the African
coast, are also submitted for your con
sideration. OLR TRADE WITH SOUTH AND CENTRAL
AMbRIUA.
The commission appointed by my pre
decessor last winter to visit the Central
and South American countries and ro-
port on the methods of enlarging the
commercial relatioos of the United
States therewith, has submitted reports
which will be laid before you.
COREA.
No opportunity has been omitted to
testify the friendliness of this govern
ment toward Corea, whose entrance to
the family of treaty powers the United
States was the first tj recognize. I re
gard with favor the application made by
the Corean government to be allowed to
employ American officers as military in
structors, to which the assent of Con
gress becomes necessary, and I am happy
to say this request has tbe concurrent
sanction of China and Japan.
ILLEGAL ARREST BY ECUADOR.
The arrest and imprisonment of Julio
It. Santos, a citizen of the United States,
by the autlioiiti.es of Ecuador gave rise
to a contention with that government,
in which bis right to be released or to
have a speedy and impartial trial on an
nounced charges, and witn an guaran
tees of defense stipulated by tree ty, was
insisted upon by us. Atter an elaborate
correspondence and repeated and earnest
representations on our part, iVlr. cantos
was. after an alleged trial and conviction
eventually included on a general decree
of amnesty and pardoned by the l-.cua
dorian Executive and released, leaving
the question of his American citizenship
deuied by the Ecuadorian government,
but insisted upon by our own.
THE FRENCH AND AMERICAN CLAIMS

The amount adjudged by the late
French and American Claims Commis
sion to be due from the United States to
French e'.aimants on account of injuries
suffered by them during the war of se
cession having been appropriated by the
last Congress, has been duly paid the
Freuch Government. The act of Feb
ruary 25. 1SS5. provided for a prelimi
nary search of the records of French
prize courts for evidence bearing on the
claims of American citizens against
France tor spoliations committed prior
to 1801. The duty has been performed.
and the report of the agent will be laid
betore you.
AMERICAN PORK IN FRANCE. GERMANY
AND AUSliUA.
I regret to say that the restrictions
upon the importation ot our pork into
Franco, notwithstanding the abundant
demonstration of tbe absence of sanitary
danger in its use, still exists, bu
I entettain strong hopes that, with
bettpr understanding of the
matter, this vexatious prohibition will
be removed. It would pleasing
to be able to say as much with respect to
Uermany, Austria and other countries
where such lood products are absolutely
excluded, without present prospect ot
reasonable change.
TREATIES' WITH GERM ANY OS STATU
HALiZAUON.
The interpretation of our existing
treaties of naturalization by Germany
during the past year has attracted atten
tion, by reason of a tendency on the part
q1 the imperial government to ex
tand the eaope of the Presidential re
trictioni to which returning naturalized
c;Uen pi Oernian origin ere assertec
to be liable un4'? tn I,w tn? em
pire. The temperate and earnest attitude
taken by this government with regard to
this class of questions will, doubtless,
lead to a satisf actory understanding.
GERMANY AND THE CAROLINE ISLANDS.
The dispute of Germany and Spain
relative to the domination of the Caro
line Islands has attracted the attention
of this government by reason of exten
sive interests of American citizens hav
ing grown up in those parts during the
past thirty years, and because the ques
tion of ownership involves jurisdiction
of matters affecting the status ot our
citizens under civil and criminal law,
while standing wholly aloot from the
proprietary issues ra sed between powers
to bothof which the United States are
friendly. This government expects that
nothing in the present contention shall
unfavorably affe it our citizens carrying
on a peaceful commerce, or there domi
ciled, and has so informed the govern
ments ot spam and Uermany.
OCR GOOD-WILL RELATIONS WITH GREAT
ismiAlN.
The marked good will between the
United States and Great Britain has
been maintained during the past vear.
The termination of the fishing clauses of
the treaty ot V asbington, in pursuance
of the joint resolution of March 3d,
18S3, must have resulted in the abrupt
cessation on the 1st of July this year, in
the midst of their ventures, of the oper
ations ot citizens ot the United States
engaged in fishing in British American
waters but tor a diplomatic understand
ing reached with her majesty's govern
ment in June last, whereby assurance
was obtained that no interruption ot
these operations should take place dur
ing the current fishing season.
THE NORTH AMERICAN FISHERIES.
In the interest of good neighborhood
and of the commercial intercourse of ad
jacent communities, the question of the
.sort a American fisheries is oneot much
importance, r ollowing out the intima
tion given by me when the extensorv ar
rangements above described were nego
tiated, I recommend that the Congress
provide for tbe appointment of a com
mission, in which the governments of the
United States and Great Britain shall be
respectively represented, charged with
the consideration and settlement, upon a
just, equitable and honorable basis, of
the entire question ot the fishing rights
of the two governments and their re
spective citizens on the coasts of the
cnueu states ana Dritisa norm Anier-
iea. the hshing interests being inti
mately related to other general questions
dependent upon contiguity and inter
course, consideration thereof in all their
equities might also properly come within
the purview of such commission, and the
fullest latitude ot expression ot both sides
should be permitted. The correspond
ence in relation to the fishing rights will
be submitted.
THE GREELY ARCTIC EXPEDITION.

which was generously given bv her ma
jesty's Government to aid in the relief of
the Ureely expedition, was, alter the

the act of March, 3, 1885. "
OCR EXTRADITION TttEATY WITH GREAT
BRITAIN.
The inadequacy of the existing en
gagements lor extradition between the
United States and Great Britain, has
been long apparent. The tenth article
of the treaty of 1842, on of the earliest
oomp-iots in this regard entered into by
the Cnited States, stipulated tor surren
der in respect of a limited number ot
offenses. Other crimes, no less inimical
to the social welfare, should be embraced,
and the procedure of extradition brought
in harmony with present international
practices. Negotiations with her majes
ty's government for an enlarged treaty of
extradition have been pending since 1870,
and 1 entertain strong hopes that a tatis
factory result will soon be attained.
THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN ALASKA AND
BRITISH COLUMBIA.
The frontier line between Alaska and
British Columbia, as defined by the
treaty of cession with Bussia, folio. ts
the demarkation ass gned in a prior
treaty between Great Britain and Kus-ia.
Modern exploration discloses that this
ancient boundary is impracticable as a
geographical fact. In the unsettled con
dition of that region the question has
lacked importance; but the discovery of
mineral weakh in the territory the lino
is supposed to traverse, admonishes that
the time has come when an accurate
knowledge of the boundary is needful to
avert jurisdictional complications. I
recomuend, therefore, that provision be
made for a preliminary recouoo sauce by
officers of the United States, to the end
of acquiring more precise information of
the subject. I have invited her majesty's
government to consider wilh us the
adoption of a more convenient line, to be
established by meridian observations, or
by known geographical features, without
the necessity of an expensive survey of
the whole.
CLAIMS
AGAINST TH8 REPUBLIC OF
HAYTI. .
Tho late insurrectionary movements
n Hayti having been quelled, the gov
ernment ot that republic has made
prompt provision for adjusting the iosees

manner determined, 'ihe long pending
claim3 of two citizens cf tho United

OUR RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
Our relations with Mexico continue
to be most cordial, as bents tho-e ot
neighbors between whom the strongest
ties ot friendship and commercial inti
macy exist, as the natural and growing
consequence ot our similarity of institu
tions and geographical propinquity. Ihe
relocation ot the boundary line between
the United States and Mexico, eastofthe
Kio Grande, under the convention of
July 29, 1882, has been unavoidably de
layed, but I apprehend no difficulty in
securing a prolongation of the period for
its accomplishment. Ihe lately con
cluded commercial treaty with Mexico
still awaits the stipulated legislation to
carry its provisions into effect, tor which
one year's additional time has been se
cured by a supplementary article, signed
in rebruary last and since ratified on
both sides.
s this convention, so important to
the commercial welfare of the two ad
joining countries, has been constitution
ally confirmed, the hope is that lee
islation needed to make it effective may
not long be delayed. 'The large influx of
capital and enterprise to Mexico from
the United States continues to aid in
the development of the resources and in
augmenting the material well-being of
our sister republic; lines of railway, pen
etratiug to the heart and capital of the
country, bring the two people into mutu

facilities ot transit add to prontable
commerce, create new markets and fur
nish avenues to otherwise isolated com
munities. I have already adverted to the sug
gested construction of a ship railway
across the narrow lormation ot the ter
ritory of Mexico at Tehauntepec. .
OUR TREATY WITH PERU.
With the gradual recovery of Peru
from the effects other disastrous conflict
with Chili, and with the restoration ot
civil authority in that distracted coun
try, it is hoped that pending war claims
of our citizens will be adjusted, in con
formity with notification given by the
government of Peru,1 the existing treaties
of commerce jind extradition between
the United States and that country will
terminate March 31, 1886.
GOOD RELATIONS WITH BUSSIA
Our good relationship with Russia con
tinues. An officer of the navy, detailed

Congress to those who so generously sue

SPAIN AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
It is gratifying to advert to the cor
dialityof our intercourse with Spain.
The long-pending claim of the owners of
the ship Masonic for losses suffered
through the admitted dereliction of
Spanish authorities in the Philippine 1st
ands has been adjusted by arbitration.
and an indemnity awarded. Ihe princi
ple of arbitration in such cases, to which
the United States have long and consist
ently adhered, thus received fresh and
gratifying confirmation. Other ques
tions with Spain have been disposed of
or are under diplomatic consideration
with a view to just and honorable settle
ment, ine operation ot the commer
cial agreement with Spain of January
2d and February 13, 1881, has been
found inadequate, and the terms of the
agreement are subjected to conflicting
interpretations in those islands.
Negotiations have been instituted at
jnadrid tor a lull treaty not ooea to
these objections, and in the line of the
general policy touching the neighborly
luieruourse oi proximate communities,
to which I elsewhere advert, and aiming,
moreover, at the removal of existing
burdens and annoying restrictions, and,
although a satisfactory termination is
promised, I am compelled to delay its
announcement. -THE
INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT CON
FERENCE. An International Copyright Confer
ence was held at Berne in September,
on the invitation of the Swiss Govern
ment. The Envoy of the United States
attended as a delegate, but refrained
from committing this government to the
results, even by signing the recommen
datory protocol adopted. The interest
ing and . important subject of interna
tional copyright has been before you for
several years. Action is certainly de
sirable to effect the object in view, and,
while there may be question as to the
relative advantage of treating it by legis
lation or by specific treaty, the matured
views of the Berne Conference cannot
fail to aid your consideration of the sub
ject.
COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH TURKEY.
The termination of the commercial
treaty of 1862 between the United States
and Turkey has been sought by that
government. While there is a question
as to the sufficiency of the notice of
termination given, yet as the commercial
rights of our citizens in Turkey come
under the favored nation guarantees of
the prior treaty of 1830, and as equal
treatment is admitted by the Porte, no
inconvenience can result from the assent
of this government to the revision of the
Ottoman tariffs, in which the treaty
powers have been invited to join. Ques
tions concerning our citizens in Turkey
may be affected by the Porte's non-acquiescence
in the right of expatriation,
a.od by tbe imposition of religious tests
as a condition of residence, in which this
government cannot conour. The United
States must hold in their intercourse
with every power that the status of their
citizens is to be respected and equal civil
privileges accorded to them, without re.
gard to creed, and affected by no consid
erations save those growing out of domi
ciliary return to the land ot original alle
giance, or of unfulfilled personal obliga
tions whioh may survive under municipal
laws after such voluntary refurn.
jMvuuiiAiiUAS wii'H VENEZUELA.
The negotiations with Venezuela rela
tive to the rehearing ot the awards of the
mixed commission constituted under the
treaty of 1866, was resumed in view of
the recent acquiescence of the Venezu-
lan envoy in the principal noint, ad
vanced by this government.that the effects
of the old treaty could only be set aside by
the operation of a new convention. A
result in substantial accord with the ad
visory suggestions contained in the joint
resolution of March 3, 1883, has been
agreed upon and will shortly be submit
ted to the Senate for ratification. a
INVESTMENT OF TREATY TRUST FUNDS.
Under section 3659 of the Revised Sta
tutes all funds held in trust by the
United States, and the annnal interest
accruing thereon when not otherwise re
quired Ty treaty, are to be invested in
stocks of the United States bearing a
rate of interest not less than 5 per cent,
per annum. There being now no procur
able stocks paying so high a rate of in
terest, the letter of the statue is at pres
ent inapplicable, but its spirit is sub
served by continuing to make invest
ments of this nature in currents stocks
bearing the highest interest now paid.
The statute, however, makes no pro
vision for the disposal of such occre
tions. It being coutrary to the general
rule of this government to allow interest
on claims, I recommend the repeal of the
provision in question and the disposition
under a uniform rule of the present ac
cumulations from investment of trust
funds.
CITIZENSHIP AND NATURALIZATION.
. The inadequacy of existing legislation
touching citizenship and naturalization
demands your consideration. While rec
ognizing the right ot expatriation, no
statutory provision exists providing
means for renouncing citizenship by an
American citizen, native born or natural
ized; for terminating and vacating an
improper acquisition of citizenship.
Even a fraudulent decree of naturaliza
tion cannot now be canceled. The
privilege and franchise of American
citizenship should be granted with car.,
and extended to those only who intend
in good faith to assume its duties and re
sponsibilities when attaining its privi
leges and benefits. It should be with
held from those who merely go through
the forms of naturalization with the in
tent ot escaping the duties of nieir
original allegiance without taking upon
themselves those of their new status, or
who may acquire the rights of American
citizenship for no other than a hostile
purpose toward their original govern
ments. These evils have had many fla
grant illustration. I regard with favor
the suggestion put forth by one of my
predecessors tnat provislOQ may be
made for a central bureau of record
of the decrees of naturalization granted
by the various courts throughout ihe
United States now invested with that
power. The rights which spring from
domicile in the United States, especially
when coupled with a declaration of in
tention to beeome a citizen, are worthy
of definition by statute. The stranger
coming hither with intent to remain, es-
ta'ulisu!" ks residence in our midst,
contributing to the general welfare, and
by this voluntary act declaring his pur
pose to assume the responsibility of
citizenship, thereby gaius an inchoate
status, which legislation may properly
define. The laws of certain States and
.Territories admit a domiciled alien to
the lojal franchise, conlernng on him
the rigHi ot citizenship to a degree
which traces him in the analogous posi
tion ot being a citizen of a State and yet
not of the L nited States within the pur
view of Federal and international law.
It is important within the scope ot na
tional legislation to define this right of
alien domicile as distinguished from fed
eral natuml association. ' '
COMMERCIAL RELATIONS AND TREATIES
H11U JlilUHBUii!U N 'N10N5.
The commercial relatia H of the
United States with their mmediate
neighbors, and with important areas of
traffic near our shores, suggest especially
liberal intercourse between them and us.
ollowing the treaty of 1883 with Mex
ico, which rested on the basis ot a re
ciprocal exemption from customs duties,
other similar treaties were initiated by
my predecessor. Recognizing the need
ot traffic with Cuba and Porto Rieo, and
met by the desire ot Spain to succor
languishing interests in the Antilles,
steps were, taken to attain those ends by
a treaty of oommerce. A similar treaty
was afterward signed by the Dominican
Republic Subsequently overtures were
made by her Britannic Majesty's govern
ment tor a like mutual extension ot com
mercial intereourse with the British
West Indian and South American inde
pendencies, but without result. On tak
ing office I withdrew for re examination
the treaties signed with Spain and Santo
Domingo, then pending before the Sen
ate. The result has Deen to satisfy me
of the inexpediency of entering into en
gagements of this character not covering
the entire traffic. These treaties con
templated - the surrender by the
United btates of large revenues for inade
quata considerations. Upon sugar alone
duties were surrendered to an amount
far exceeding all the advantages offered
in exchange. Even were it intended to
relieve our consumers, it was evident
that so lonf as fhe exemption but par
tially covered our importation, such re
lief would be illusory. To relinquish t
revenue so essential seemed highly im
prudent at a time when new and large
drains upon the Treasury were contem
plated. Moreover, embarrassing ques
tions would have arisen under the "fa
vored nation'' clauses of treaties with
other nations. As a further objection
it is evidant that tariff regulation by
treaty diminishes tnat independent eon
trol over its own revenues which is es
sential for the safety and walfara of any.
government. An emergency calling for
an increase ol taxation may at any time
arise, and no engagement with a foreign
power should exist to hamper the action
of the government. By the fourteenth
section .of the shipping act approved
June .26, 1S84, certain reductions and
contingent exemptions from tonnage dues
were made as.to vessels entering ports of
tne united states Irom any foreign port
in rsortn and Central America, the tV est
India Islands, the Bahamas and Bermu
das, Mexico, and the Isthmus as far as
Aspinwau and fanama. The govern
ments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany,
Portugal, and Sweden and Norway have
asserted, - nnder the favored na
tion" clause in their treaties with
the United States, a claim to
like treatment in respect to ves
sels coming to the United States from
their home port This government,

ed by the act are purely geographical.
inuring to any vessel of any power that
may choose to engage in traffic between
this country and any port within the de
fined zOne, and no warrant exists under
the most favored nation clause for the
extension of the privileges in question
to vessels sailing to this country from
ports outside the limitation of the act.
Undoubtedly the relations ot commerce
with our near neighbors, which terri
tories form so long a frontier-line, diffi
cult to be guarded, and who find in onr
country, and equally offer to us, natural
markets, demand special and considerate
treatment. It rests with Congress to
consider what legislative action may in
crease facilities of intercourse which
continuity makes natural and desirable.
APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE DIPLOMATIC
I earnestly urge that Congress recast
the appropriations for the maintenance
ot the diplomatic and consular service
on a footing commensurate with the im
portance of our national interests at
every port where a representative is
necessary. The salary should be so
graded as to permit bim to live with
comtort. W ith the assignment of ade

Treasury. By restoring these revenues
to the public use the consular service
would he self-supporting, even with a
liberal increase of the present low sal
aries. Id further prevention of abuses,
a system of consular inspection should be
nstituted. Ihe appointment ot a
limited number ot Secretaries of
Legation -at large, to be assigned to duty
wherever necessary, and in particular
for temporary service at missions which
for any cause may be without a
head, should also be authorized. I favor
also authorization for the detail of officers
of the regular service as military or naval
attaches at legations. Some foreign gov
ernments do not reoognize the union of
consular with diplomatic functions.
Italy and Venezula will only receive the
appointee in one of his two capacities,
but this does not prevent the require
ment of a bond and submission to the
responsibilities of an office whose duties
he oannot discharge. The superadded
title of Consul-General should be aban
doned at all missions.
EXTRA TERRITORIAL COURTS IN FOREIGN
COiyiRlKS.
I deem it expedient that a well-devised
measure tor the reorganization ot the
extra territorial courts in Oriental cou li
nes should replace the present svBtem.
which labors under the disadvantage oi
combining judicial and executive func
tions in the same office.
GIFTS OF LAND BY JAPAN AND 6IAM.
In several Oriental countries generous
offers have been made of premises for
housing the legations of the United
States. A grant of land for that purpose
was made some years since by Japan, and
has Deen reierred to in the annual mes
sages of my predecessors. The Siamese
overnment has made agif t to the L nited
Itates of commodious Quarters in Bang
kok.
In Corea the late Minister was per
mitted to purchase a building from the
government for legation use. In China
the premises rented for the legation are
favored as to local charges. At Tangier
the house ocoupicd by our representa
tive has been for many years the proper
ty of the government, having benn given
for that purpose in 1882 by tbe Sultan of
Morocco. I approve the suggestion
heretofore made thai, in view of the
conditions of life and administration in
the Western countries, tbe legation
buildings in China, Japan, Corea, Siam,
and, perhaps, Persia, should be owned
and furnished by the government with a
view to permanency and security. To
this end, I reoommend that authority be
5iven to accept the gilts adverted to in
apan and Siam, and to purchase in the
other countries named, with provision
for furniture and repairs. A consider
able caving in rental would result.
HOME AFFAIR8.
The World's Industrial Exposition.
held at New Orleans last winter, with tbe
assistance of the Federal government,
attracted a large number of foreign ex-
fiibits, and proved of great value in
pleading among the concourse of visit

Past Congresses have had under con
sideration the advisability of abolishing
the discrimination made by the tariff
laws in favor of the works of American
artists. The odium of the policy which
subjects to a high rate of duty the paint
ings of foreign artists and exempts the
productions of American artists residing
abroad, and who reoei ?e gratuitously ad
vantages and instruction, is visited upon
our citizens engaged ia artnnU J.

The report of the Secretary of the
Treasury fully exhibits the condition of
the public finances and of the several
branches ot the government connected
with his department. The suggestions
of the Secretary in relation to practical
operations of this important department,
and his recommendations in the direction
of simplification and economy, particu

REVENUE REFORM THK OREATKT G0OI)
The fact that our revenues are in ex
cess of the actual needs of an econom
ical administration ot the government
justifies a reduction in the amount ex
acted lrom the people for its support.
Our government is but the means estab
lished by the will of a free people by
which certain principles are applied

fit and protection, and it is never better
administered, and its true spirit is never
better observed than when the people's
taxation for its support is scrupulously
jimited to the actual necessity of expend
iture Zand distributed according to a
Ju8t n.a. equitable plan. Ihe proposi
".n wuicn. wo have to deal

nrnm.nt ;j;mi k ' ivl
w www avww UVI to
there now any occasion for the general
discussion of the wisdom and expediency
of a protective system. Justice and fair
ness dictate that in any modification of
our present laws relating to revenue, the
industries and interests which have been
encouraged by such laws and in which
our citizens have large investments
should not be ruthlessly injured or de
stroyed. We should also deal with the
subject in such manner as to protect the
interests of American labor, which is
the capital of our workingmen. Its sta
bility and proper remuneration furnish
the most justifiable pretext for a protect
ive policy.'- Within these limitations a
certain reduction should be made in our
customs revenue. The amount of such
reduotion having been determined, the
inquiry follows, "Where can it best be
remitted, and what articles oan best be
released from duty in the interest of our
citizens?" I think the reduction should
be made in the revenue derived from a
tax upon the imported necessarie jf
life. We thus directly lessen the cost of
living in every family of the land, and
release to the people in every humble
home a larger measure of the rewards of
frugal industry.
.THE NATIONAL BANKS.
During the year ended November 1,
1885, 115 national Y nks were organized
with an aggregate capital of $16,038,000,
and circulating notes have been issued to
them amounting to $4,274,910. The
whole number of these banks in exist
ance on the day above mentioned was
2727. The very limited amount of circu
lating notes issued by our national hanks,
compared with the amount the law per
mits them to issue upon a deposit ot
bonds for their redemption, indicates
that the volume of our circulating me
dium may be largely increased through
tins instrumentality,
TBE
MISCHIEF OF THE FRAUDULENT
SILVER DOLLAR.
Nothing more important than the pres
ent oondition of our currency and coin
age can claim your attention. Since
February, 1878, the government has, un
der the compulsory provisions of law,
purchased silver bullion and coined the
same at the rate ot more than $2,000,000
every month. By this process, up to the
present date, 215,759,431 silver dollars
have been coined. A reasonable appre
ciation of a delegation of power to the
general government would limit iu ex
ercise, without express restrictive words,
othe people's needs and the require
ments ot the publio welfare. Upon this
theory, the authority to "coin money,"
given to Congress by the Constitution, if
t permits tbe purchase by the govern
ment ot bullion tor coinage in any event,
does not justify such purchase and coin
age to" an extent beyond the amount
needed for a sufficient circulation me
dium. The desire to utilize the silver
product of the country should not lead
to a misuse or the perversion of this
power. The necessity for such au addi
tion to the silver currency of the nation
as is compelled by the silver coinage act
is negatived by the fact that up to the
present about 50,000,000 of silver dollars
so coined have actually found their way
into circulation, leaving more than 165,
000,1.00 in possession oi government, the
custody of which has entailed a consid
erable expense for construction of vaults
for its deposit. Against this latter
amount there are outstanding silver cer
tificates amounting to $93,000,000. Every
month $2,()00,00u o gold in the publio
Treasury are paid out for $2,000,000 or
more, of silver, to be added to the idle
mass already accumulated. If continued
long enough this operation will result in
the substitution of silver for all the fold
the government own? applicable to its
general purposes. It will not do to rely
upon the customs receipts of the govern
ment to make good this drainof gold, be
sanstthe silver dollar coined having
been made !sgl tender for all debts and
dues, public and private. At times dur
ing the last six mouths 58 per cent, of
the receipts for duties have been in sil
ver or silver certificates, while the aver
age wii hin that period has been 20 per
cent. Portion ot silver and its certifi
cates received by the government will
probably increase as time goes on, for
the reason that the nearer the period
approaches when it will be obliged to
offer silver in payment of its
obligations the greater inducement
there will be to hoard gold
against depreciation in the value ot sil
ver or for the purpose ot speculating.
This hoarding or gold has already begun.
W hen the time comes that gold has been
withdrawn from circulation, then will be
apparent the difference between the real
vatue ot tbe silver dollar and a dollar in
gold, and the ooins will part company.
Gold, still the standard of value and
necessary in our dealings with other
counties, will be a premium of silver,
banks which have substituted gold for
the deposits of their customers, may
pay them with silver bought with such
gold, making a handsome profit. Rich
speculators will sell their boarded gold
to their neigh Dors, who need it to liqui
date their foreign dects, at a ruinous
premium over silver, and the laboring
men and women of the land, most de
fenseless of all, will find that the dollar
received tor the wage of their toil has
sadly shrunk in its purchasing power.
It may be said that the latter result will
be but temporary, and that ultimately
the price ot labor will be adjusted
to tho change: but even it this takes
place the wage-worker cannot possibly
gain but must inevitably lose, since the
price be is compelled to pay tor his liv
ing will not only be measured in a coin
heavily depreciated and fluctuating and
uncertain in its value, hut this uncer
tainty in the value of the purchasing
medium will be made tbe pretext lor an
advance in prices beyond that justified
by actual depreciation, ihe words ut
tered in 1834 by Daniel Webster in the
Senate of the United States are true to
day: "Tbe very man of all others who
has the deepest interest in a sound cur
rency and who sutlers most by mis
chieveous legislation in money matters is
the man who earns his daily bread by his
daily toil. Ihe most distinguished ad
vocate ot bimetallism discussing our
silver coinage has lately written: "No
American citizen s hand has yet felt tbe
sensation of cheapness either in receiv
ing or expending the silver act dollars,
and those who live by labor or legitimate
trade will feel that sensation of cheap
ness. "However plenty silver dollars may
become they will not be distributed as
gift9 among the people. And if the
laboring man should receive four deore
ciated dollars where he now receives but
two he will pay in tbe depreciated coin
more than double the price he now pays
tor all the necessaries and comforts of
life. Those who do not tear any dis
astrous consequence arising from tbe
continued compulsory coinage of silver
as now directed by law, and who suppose
that the addition to the currency of the
country intended that its results will be a
public benefit, are remiaded that history
demonstrates that the .point ia aasily
reaohad in tie attempt to leat at tbe
Mm tim two Mrt ' w-iy
of different excellence when the better
will cease to be iu circulation. The
boarding of gold which has already taken
place indicates that we shall not escape
the usual experience in such cases. 8o,
if this silver coinage be continued, we
may reasonably expect that gold and ita
equivalent win abandon the held ot cir
culation to silver alone. This, of course
must produce a severe contraction of our
circulating medium instead ot adding to
it. It will not be disputed that any at
tempt on the part of the government to
cause the circulation of silver dollars
worth 90 cents side by side with gold
dollars worth 100 cents, even with the
limit that legislation does not run
counter to laws of trade, to be successful
must be seconded by the confidence of
the people, that both coins will retain
tbe same purchasing power and be inter
changeable at will. A special effort hai
been made by the Secretary ot the
Treasury to increase the amount of our

MANTON MARBLE'S MISSION TO EUROPE.
What has been thus far submitted nn the
subject relates almost entirely to consid
erations of a home nature, unconnected
with the bearing which the polioies of
otner nations nave upon tbe question,
but it is perfectly apparent that the
line of action in regard to our currency
cannot wisely be settled on or persisted
in, without considering the attitude oa
the subject of other countries with whom
we maintain intercourse through com
merce, trade and travel. An acknowl
edgement of this fast is found in the act
by virtue of which our silver is compul
sorily coined. It pro rides that the Pres
ident shall invite the governments of
the countries composing the Latin Uni-u.
so called, and of such other European
nations as he may deem advis
able, to join the United States in
conference to adoDt a ratio
between gold and silver for the pur
Dose of establishing an international
standard for the use of bimetallic money,
and securing a fixity of relative value
between these metals. This conference
absolutely failed, and a similar fate
awaited all subsequent efforts in the
same direction, and still we continue our
coinage of silver at a ratio different
from that of any other na
tion. The most vital nart of
the silver coinage act remains
inoperative and unexecuted, and without
an ally or friend we battle upon the sil
ver field in an illogical and losing con
test. To give full effect to the design
of Congress on these subjects, I have
made careful and earnest endeavor sinee
the adjournment of the last Congress.
i o tins end i delegated a gentleman well
instructed in fiscal science to proceed to
tne nnancial centers ot turope, and, in
conjunction with our Ministers to Eng
land, France and Germany, to obtain a
full knowledge of tbe attitude and in
tent of these governments in respect to
the establishment of such an interna
tional ratio as would procure free coinage
of both metals at the mints ot these
countries and our own. By my direction
our Consul-Genenl at Paris has given
close attention to the proceedings of the
Congress ot the Latin Union, in order to
indicate our interest in its objects and
report its actioo. It may be said, in
brief, as to the result of these reports,
that the attitude of the leading nations
is substantially unchanged since the
monetary conference ot 1881. Nor is
it to be questioned that the views of
these governments are in each instance
supported by the weight of publio opin
ion. ' The s eps thus taken have there
fore only more fully demonstrated the
uselessness of further attempts at pres
ent to arrive at any agreement on the
subject with other nations. In the
meantime we are accumulating silver
coin, based upon our own peculiar ratio,
to such an extent and assuming so heavy
a burden to be provided for in any inter
national negotiations as will render us an
undesirable party to any future monetary
conference of nations.
THE LATIN UNION.
It is a significant fact that four of the
five countries composing the Latin Union
mentioned in our coinage aot, em
barrassed with their silver currenoy, have
just completed an agreement among
themselves that no more silver shall be
coined by their respective governments,
and that such as has already been coinod
and in circulation shall be redeemed in
gold by the country of its coinage. The
resort to this expedient by these coun
tries may well arrest the attention of
those who suppose we can succeed with
out shock or injury in the attempt to
circulate upon its merits all the silver we
may ooin under the provisions ot the
silver coinage act. The condition in
which our Treasury may be placed by a
persistence in our present course is a
matter of ooncern to every patriotic citi
zen who does desire his government to
pay in silver such of its obligations as
should be paid in golei. Nor should c"T
condition be such as to oblijfc us, in a
Srudent management 0r our "affairs, to
iscontiauf tie calling in and payment
of Interest-bearing obligations which wn
have the right now to discharge, and thus
avoid the further payment of interest
thereon.
EFFECTS OF
THE UNLIMITED
OF SILVER.
COINAGE
The so-called debtor class, for whose
benefit the continued oompufsory coin
age of silver is insisted .upon, are not
oisbonest because they are in deot, and
they should not be suspected of a desire
to jeopardize the financial safety of the
country in order that they way cancel
their present debts by paying the same
in depreciated dollars. Nor should it
be torgotten, it is not the rich nor the
money-lender that must submit to such
a readjustment enforced by the govern
ment and their debtors, the pittance
of the widow and the orphan and the
incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all
kinds would be disastrously reduced.
The depositors in savings banks and
in other institutions whioh hold in trust
the savings of the people, when their
little accumulations are scaled down to
meet the new order of things would in
their distress painfully realize the delu
sion made to them that plentiful money
would improve their oondition. Wo
have now on hand all the
silver dollars neoessary to sup
ply the present needs of the people
and to satisfy those who, from sentiment.
wish to see them in circulation, and if
their coinage is suspended they can be
readily obtained by all who desire them.
It tbe need ot more is at any time ap
parent their ooinage may be renewed.
That disaster has not already overtaken
us furnishes no proof; but danger does
not wait upon a continuation ot tbe pres
ent silver coinage. We have been saved
by the most careful management and un
usual expedience by a combination of
fortunate conditions and by a confident
expectation that the oommerce of the
government in regard to silver coinage
would be speedily changed by action ot
Congress. Prosperity hesitates upon our
threshold because of the dangers and un-,
certainties surrounding this question.
Capital timidly shrinks from trade, and
investors are unwilling to takte the
chance of the questionable shape
in which their money will be
returned to them, while enterprise halts
at a risk against which care and saga
cious management do not protect. At a
necessary consequence labor lacks em
ployment, and suffering and distress are
visited upon a portion of our fel'ow
oitizens especially entitled to the care
ful consideration of those charged with
the duties of legislation. No interest
appeals to us so strongly for a safe and
stable currency as the vast army ot the
unemployed. I recommend the suspen
sion of the compulsory coinage of the
silver dollar directed by the laws passed
in February, 1878.
THE STEAMBOAT INSPECTION SERVICE.
The steamboat inspection service, on
the 30th day of June. 1885. was com
posed of 140 persons, including officers,
clerks and messengers. The expenses of
the service over the receipts were $138,
822 22 during the fiscal year. The spec
ial inspection of foreign vessels, organ
ized under the law passed in 1882, was
maintained during the year at an ex
pense of $36,641 63. Since the close of
the fiscal year reductions have been
made in the foree employed, whioh will
result in a saving during the present
year of 117,000, without affecting the
efficiency of the service.

has prevailed iu Spain and Prance, and

THE LIFE-SAVING SERVICE.
l ne most gratifying results have at
tended the operations of the lite-saving
service during tne last nscal year, tp
ooservance oi tne provision of law re
quiring the appointment of the force
employed in the service to be made
solely with reference to their fitness, and
without reference to their political or

this service is composed of men well
qualified for the performance of their
dangerous and exceptionally important
duties. The number of stations in com
mission at the olose ot the year was 203.
The number of disasters to vessels and
crafts ot all kind within their held ot
action was 371. The number ot persons
endangered in sucb d.sasters was iKil,
of whom 2428 were saved, only eleven
lost. Other lives which were imperiled,
though not bv disasters to shiinim
ware also recovered, and a large amount
ot property was saved through the aid ol
this service. The eost of its mainten
ance during the year was $828,474 43.
THE COAST AND GEODETIC SURVEY.
The work of the coast and geodetic
survey was. auring tne last nsai var
carried on within the boundaries and off
the coasts ot thirty-two btates. two Ter
ritories and the District of Columbia.
In July last certain irregularities wr
found to exist in the?nianairemint n( tl.i
bureau which led to a prompt investiga
tion of its methods. The abuses which
were brought to light by this examiua
tion, and the reckless disregard of duty
and the interests of the government
developed on the part ot some of those
connected with the service, made a
change of its superintendence and a few
of its other officers necessary. Sinoc tlie
bureau has been in new hands an intro
duction of eoonomy and application ol
business methods have produced an im
portant saving to the government a: d a
promise of more usefulness. This service
has never beeu regulated by nnuhine
but most indefinite legal enaetmer tx anrf
the most unsatisfactory rules. It wan
many years ago sanctioned apparently
for a purpose regarded as tempo
rary, and related to a survey 1
our coast. Having gained a place in the
appropriations made bv Congress, it has
gradually taken to itself points and ob
jects not contemplated in its creation,
and extended its operations until it
sadly needs legislative attention. So fir
as a further survey of our coast is con
cerned, there seems to be a propriety in
iiauaioiriug uih worn to ine avy l'e
partment. The other dntipH minr in
charge of this establishment, if they can
not be profitably attached to some exist
ing department or other bureau, should
be prosecuted under a law exactly de
fining their soope and purpose, and with
a careful discrimination between the
scientific inquiries which may properly
be assumed bv the government anil th.iso
whioh should be undertaken by State
authority or by individual enterprise. It
is hoped that the report of tho Con
gressional committee heretofore ao
pointe i to investigate this and other like
matters will aid in the accomplishment
of proper legislation on this subject.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR.
The report of the Secretary of War i
herewith submitted. The attention of
Congress is invited to the detailed ao-
oount which it contains of the adminis
tration of his department and his recom
mendations and suggestions for the im
provement of the servioe. The armv
consisted at the date of the last consoli"
dated returns of 2154 officers and 24.70J
enlisted men. The expenses of the de
partments for the fiscal vear ended June
30, 1885, including l"3,164,3!4 60 tor
public works and river and harbor im
provements, were $45,850,999 54. Bo
des the troops which were rimnt.-li,.1
in pursuit of the small band of Indians
who left their reservation in Arizona and
committed murders and outrages two
regiments of cavalry and one ot infantry
were sent last July to the Indian Terri
tory tp prevent au outbreak which
seemed imminent. They remained to
aid, if neoeaaary, in tho ezpulsiou of
usurpers upon the reservation, who
seemed to have caused the discontent
among the Indians, but the executive
proclamation warning them to remove
was Complied with withniitTintrrrons
Troops were also sent to Hock Springs,
in Wyoming Territory, after the massa
ere of Chinese there, to prevent further
uisturoance, and atterwards to Seattle, in
Washington territory, to avnri a threat
ened attack upon Chinese laborers and
uomestio violence, in both cases the
mere presence of the tronns had the .).
sired effect. It appears that the number
oi desertions nave diminished, but tint
during the last fiscal year they numbered
-J-i, and one instance is given bv tho
lieutenant-general of six desertions by
the same recruit. I am convinced that
this number of desertions can bo much
diminished by better discipline aud treat
ment, but the punishment oui(j be in
oreased for repeated e n..' Th,, d.
senious miht lg0 be reduced by lesseo
ln tiie the term of first enlistments, thus
allowing a discontented recruit to con
template a nearer discharge and the army
a profitable riddance. After one term of
servioe a re-enlistment would be quite
apt to secure a contented recruit and good
soldier. The Aoting Judge-Advocate
General reports that the number (if
trials by general oourt-martial dur
ing the year was 2328, and that
11,851 trials took place before
garrison and regimental courts-martial
The suggestion that probably more than
half the army have been tried for offenses
great and small in one yearn may well ar
rest attention. Of course many ot these
trials before garrison and regimental
courts-martial were for offenses almoht
frivolous, and there should. I think, be
a way devised to dispose ot these in
more summary and less inconvenient
manner than by court-martial. If some
ot the proceedings of courts-martial
which x have bad oocasion to examine
present the ideas ot justice which gen
erally prevails in these tribunal, I am
satisfied that they should be much re
formed, if the honor and the honesty of
the army and navy are, by their instru
mentality, to be vindicated and pro
tected.
SEA-COAST DEFENSES.
The board of fortifications or other
defenses, appointed in pursuance ot tbe
provisions ot the aot ot I ongress ap
proved March 3, 1885, will in a short
time present their report, and it is hoped
that this may greatly aid the legislation
so necessary to remedy the present da
ienseless oondition of our sea coasts.
THE SIGNAL SERVICE.
The work of the Signal Service hits
been prosecuted during the last year
with results ot increasing benefit to tbe
country. The field of instruction has
been enlarged with a view to adding to
its usefulness, the number ot stations
in operation June 30. 1885. was 489.
Telegraphic reports are received daily
from 160 stations. Reports are also re
ceived from 75 Canadian stations, 375
volunteer observers, 52 army sergeants
at military posts, and 333 foreign sta
tiona. The expense during the fiscal
year, after deduoting receipts from
military telegraph, was $797,592 97.
in view ot the tact, referred to by the
Seoretary of War, tbat work of this
service ordinarily is of a scientific na
ture, and the further fact that it is as
suming larger proportions constantly,
and becoming more and more unsuited
to tbe fixed rules which must govern the
army, I am inclined to agree with him
in the opinion that it should be separate
ly established. If this is done, the
soope and extent ot its operations
should as nearly as possible be definitely
prescribed by law, and always capable ol
exact ascertainment.
TBE MILITARY ACADEMY AT WST
POINT.
The Miliary Academy of West Point
is reported as being in a high state of
efficiency, and well eauipped for th
satisfactory accomplishment of the pur
poses of its maintenance. The fact tbat
the class which graduates next vear i
an unusually large one has constrained
me to decline to make appointments to
second lieutenancies in the armv from
civil lite, so that such vacancies as exist
in these plaoes may be reserved for sue
graduates, and yet it is not probable that
there will be enough vaoancies to provide
positions for them all when they leave
the nilitary school. Under the prevail
ins law and usage, tnoae not thus as
signed to duty never actively enter the
military service. It ia suggested tbat tb

should be a general law ot Congress pro
hibiting the construction of bridges over
navigable waters in such manner
obstruct navigation. It seems that,
under existing statutes, the government
cannot intervene to prevent such a con
struction, when entered upon without it
consent, though when such oooaont is
asked and granted upon condition that
authority to insist upon such oonditioa
is clear. Thus it is represented that
while the officers of the government are
with great care guarding against the ob
struction ot navigation by abridge across
the Mississippi river at St. Paul, a large
pier for a bridge has been built just be
low this place, direotlv in the navinhla
channel of the river. If suoh things are
to be permitted, a strong argument ia
presented against the appropriation of
arge sums ot money to improve the nav
gation ol fhis and other important high-
ys oi commerce.

MPORTANCK OF AN EFFECTIVE NAVY.
All must admit tln ininnriimw n
fleotive navy to a nation like ours. Hav-
ng such an extended seacoast to pro
tect, and yet we have not a ainele teasel
:' war that eoald keep the seas against
first-class vessel of any important pow
er. ruch a condition ought not longer
o continue. The nation that cannot re
sist aggression is constantly exposed to
its foreign policy is of necessity weak
nd its negotiations are conducted with
lsadvautage because, it is not in a oon-
ition to cnlorce the terms diotated bv
ts sense ot right aud justice Inspired
s i am by the hope shared bv all patri
otic citizens that the day is not fVr die-
ant when our navy will be such as be
lts our standing among the nations of
he earth, and rejoiced at rwrv atonih.t
eadi- in ihe direction of such a consum
mation, 1 deem it my duty to especially
ireet tho attention of I 'omrreaa tn the
lose of the report ot the Secretary of
he Navy, iu which the humiliating
weakness of the present organization of
this department is exhibited and the
startling abuses and waste of its presout
iiintnous are expressed. I be conviction
s forced upon us with the certainty cf
mathetuatic.il demonstration that before
we proceed further in the restoraAion ot
a navy, we need a thoroughly reorganized
Navy Department. Tho fact that within
seventeen years moro than $75,01(0,000
has been spent iu Construction, repair,
rquipment and armament of vessels, and
ho turttier lt that, instead of an eflent-
ve and creditable fleet, wo have only
ho disconteut and apprehension of a
nation undefended by war vessels, added
to the disclosures now made, do not per
mit us to doubt that every attempt to
revive our navy has thus far for the moot
part been misdirected, and all our effort
n mat airection nave oeen nitio better
han blind gropings and expensive, aim
less follies. Unquestionably, if we are
content with tho maintenance of a
Navy Department, Bimply a shabby
ornament to the government, a constant
watchfulness may prevent some of the
scaudal nod abuse which have found
their, way into our naval organisation
and its incurable waste may be reduoed
to the minimum. But it we desire to
build ships for present usefulness, in-
tead ot reminders ot tbe days past, we
have a department organized for the
woik supplied with all the talent and in
genuity our country affords, and to take
advantage of theexperieuoe of other na
tions, gystcmotized so that all effort shall
unite and h ad in one direotion,and fully
imbued with the conviction that war
vessels, though new, are useless unless
they combine all that tho ingenuity of
man has up to this day brought lorth ro
uting to their construction. I earnestly
commend the portion of the Secretary's
report devoted to this subject to the ac
tion of Congress, in the hope that his
suggestiona touching the reorganization
of his department will be adopted, as
the first step toward the reconstruction
ot our navy.
THE POSTAL SERVICE.
The affairs of the postal service are
exhibited by the report ot the Postmas-
ter-Uuneral, which will be laid before
you. l be postal revenue, whose ratio ot
gam iipnu the rising prosperity of 1882
and 1883 outstripped the Increasing ex
penses oi our growing pervioe, was
checked by the reduotion in the rate of
letter postage, which took effect with the
beginuing of October in tbe latter year,
and it diminished during -the two past
h-eal years f2.i9H,00O, in about the pro
portion of $2,270,0110 in 1884 to $520,000
in 18-5. The natural growth and de
velopment have meantime increased ex
penditure, resulting in a defioianov in
the revenue to meet the expenses of the
department ot five and a quarter millions
for the year 1884 and eight and a third
millions in the last fiscal year. The an
ticipated natural revival of the revenue
has been retarded by tne unfavorable-
business condition of the oountrv. of
which the postal service is a faithful in
dicator. The gratifying fact ia shown.
however, by the report, that our return
ing prosperity ia marked bv a gain of
$380,iO in the revenue of th latter half
of this over the preceding year.
the change in tbe weight ot firstsolaas
matter which may be carried for a single
rate postage from a half ounce to an
ounce, ud the reduction by one-half of
the rate ot newspaper postage, which
under recent legislation begun with the
current year, will operate to restrain aug
mentation of receipts, which otherwise
might have been expected to suoh a de
gree that tbe scale of expense may gain
upon the revenue and cause increased
deficiency to be shown at its close, yet
lor no long period of reawakened pros
perity, by proper economy it it confidently
anticipated that even the present low
rates, now as favorable as any country
affords, will be adequate to sustain the
cost of the servioe. The operation of the
Postoffioe Department is ior the country
and benefit of the people, and the method
by whioh they pay the charges of this
useful arm of their publio servioe,
to that it is just and impartial, is of leas
importance to them than the nominal
expense of the means they provide for
its maintenance and the improvement
of its scents, so that they enjoy ita use
fulness. A proper etfntioB has ba)
