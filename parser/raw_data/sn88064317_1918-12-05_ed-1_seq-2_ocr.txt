The President's Message
In joint session Congress heard
President Wilson in making his
annual address before that august
body, Monday, announce formally
his purpose to attend the peace
conference overseas, sailing yes
terday from New York on the
liner George Washington with his
party. The President, in giving
his views o:i the part the govern
ment slioidd play in dealing with
after-tne- w.-.r problems,—re v iewed
at length our country's accom
plishments in the war, paying
tribute to the armed forces and
loyal workers at home ; had no
solution to offer on the railroad
question ; said he was r
ed to prevent a return to the old
system under private management,
without rood ifi :at ion, and asked
Congress to study the question.
Recommended and requested a
new appeal for c*iual suffrage, in
recogv! *■•«*. of woman's work in
the war; favorable and early ac
tion on tie unratif'.ed Columbia
treaty, and suggested that author
ity be given the war board or some
other body to continue control for
a time over exports.
In concluding with the nnnounce
raeDt °f h* s tr *P» he said that thru
cable and wireless he would keep
in close touch with all that went
on on this side, and Congress
would kndw all that he does, as he
regarded it his highest duty to
play lus lull
part in making good
what America's soldiers had offer
ed their life's blood to obtain.

The first ore to be given was to
.Mrs. I'ctiis, ' whose son died lo
France, tho there are a few other
Natchitoches boys, and happily
very few,v\ ho died in camps on this
side, of the flu, whose families

way.
They will be presented to the
wife, either or both parents, but
any other member of the family

Mr. Gordon Peters
Among those whose names will
he inscribed as heroes in this
world's world, that of Gordon
Peters cf Natchitoches, will go
down in history. Iho but a boy,
less than eight ec when the United
States i ;e rfarod r.; lie was «mon;
the first to volunteer, and went 1
tort.li lo do battle lor the gnat
cause. Mis letter.-, from overseas
were bright and full of the army
life, that he thoroughly enjoyed,
until tv. u or three weeks ago, when
a letter came from a Red Cross
nurse, telling that he was wound
ed, but i'li: ! of ho, e sod loving ...
sages io !.. ; mot. • i , il at ho v < uid
write h t I liaise If within the next
few days. Bui, alas! the letter
never ( ; me, and. ■ :.»* waited with
saddened heart and, wjiile hoi ing
against hope, felt with a motlioi s
intuition, that it never would.
Sunday night the War Department
officially uotilied Mis. Peters that
her boy had been wounded on Oc
tober 11th, and died two days
later, and this news just confirmed
the loving mother's fears.
Gordon was a bright, manly lad,
the third boy and youngest child,
and dearly beloved by ail who
knew him, for his happy disposi
tion and line character, and to the
widowed mother and brothers anil
sisters tender sympathy is extend
ed for the L>oy whose gold star is
the first to be inscribed on Natch
itoches' service flag, as having
died in France.
