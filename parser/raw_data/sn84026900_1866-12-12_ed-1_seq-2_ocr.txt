Our friend Sadler over the wuv is, na i
usual, up with the times. Ha has just
received everything needed for t}ie Christi
inas holidays. See his advertisement in
today's paper aud he sure and give him
call.
The advertisement of Messrs. MeDon.
Aid it MeCurry, in to d iy'a p 'per, cannot
fail to attract the attention of our reader*.
Person* visiting Camden will find it to
their interest to give them a call. They
hare a good selection and can satisfy the
wants of everybodv.
Tone and Temper of CongressThe
tone and temper of Congress, as
exhibited by the proceedings of both
branches thus far are decidedly radical.
Another indication of this is the passage,
by a vote of 107 against 37, of a resolu.
tion directing inquiry into the expediency
of extending territorial government over
the Southern State*.
The President's Message.
We five nlace to the prolusion nnar.
~r- r *" v*
ly everything else, in tbi* is.-tte, to that
portion of the President's Metn^e which
relates to "reconstruction." Those who
believed that it would contain roc
ommentations of startling and danger*
Otis amendments, and compromises with
the dominant Kulicd power, will find
that they have been deceived, lie main
?ains steaddy tho same position that he
lock in the beginning. The message is
clear, able and well written, and devoid
of ail bitter denunciations ; but at the
same time, concedes nothing, recat'e no
thing, and is (inn and temperate from
beginning to end.
The Legislature.
^Tlie proceedings of this tardy present but
very little of general Interest. Tim press ap
on our columns this week try advertisers, prevents
us giving the proceedings in full. We j
condense mc following items :
Tlic Hon. ./ohn B. Campbell has been elected
United Stated Senator. In the last ballot, |
Mr. Campbell received 95 vote* ; Gen. J. H. '
Kershaw, 30 ; Hon ,/ohn L. Manning, 1 ; Hon
John A. Iiiglia, 1. The bill t> repeal the u^n ry
laws has passed both House*. Mr. Fort introduced
a bill to abolish the District Comt* ;
also a bill to call a Convention ol the peoplo o'
the State. Mr, Moore introduced a toll to ei?
tend the number of sureties now allowed on
bonds of cominiasioners in equity.
Mr. Henry aUo introduced a hill to confer
upon Masters and Commissioner* in Kqu:ty,
authority to proceed against purchasers failing
to comply with bids made at their rules.
Signs of the Times.
On all sides event# thicken. The throat
tened doom is fast approaching. The
coining session of Congress promise* to
be the most interesting convened since
the days of the liepublic. Should the 1
Mongrels try to impeach the President,
we think war inevitable ; already the
clouda are gathering. Opr troops have
taken possession of Mexican territory, and
seem anxious to kick up a muss with
somebody. England is concentrating
forces on our Northern holders. The Fa
mans is aaid to have arisen in Ireland.?
The negroes are growing less manageable,
and consequently, laes serviceable to the
South, every day. They have hold meet
ings In several Districts and arranged e
higher price for labor. The result is easily
foreseen ; but very few will get steady
employment. Then follows stealing, rab.
berr, shooting, and finally insurrection.
Evidently events for the next year pro
mise to he an conspicuous as for the last
five. Ooe of the Great Seals must have
been opened when Abraham Lincoln was
elected in 1800; for ii has done lot!*
else than taiu fire and brimstone ever ,
since.
Wk adverted a few weeks ago to the
necessity of a stsam saw mill to supply '
the ready wants of this community with ,
awed lumbar. We are pleased to leern
that onr suggestion Las met with the
earnest approval of a company of g*n 1
tleinan who command the cap!tal to make
such no eritetprise a perfeet succ**s. The ,
machinery has already been purchased t
nd shipped for this place. * I
In connection with this, we may again
remind our citizens of the great naad of
a grist.mil) in our Village. No little in* t
convenience and loss is a sufficient incen- r
tive to urge us forward in this matter.? '
It would not only he a benefit to the Vil. 1
lags, but the aurrotindirg country ; be- ^
sides, if property conducted, would pay t
bsndsome'y. Who will try it? (,

President's Message.
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate
and House of Ji'prcsentu lives :
Af'er a hrief intervmI the Congress of
tlio United States resumes its animal leg
isUtive labors. An all*wide atd merciful
Providence has hbaled the peattleiic*
which visited our shores, leaving its calamitous
tr?e?H upon some portions of our
country. Peace, order, tranquility, and
civil authority have been formally declared
to exist throughout the United Slates, i
In all^of tha States civil aiilholity Its*
superceded the coercion of arms, and the
people !>v their voluntary action, are
maintaining their governments in foil ae
tivitv end complete operation. The en
for cement of the law* is no longer "oh
structe ! in any State I?v combinations too
powerful to he suppressed hv the ordma
rv course of judicial proceedingsand
the animosities engendered hv the war
aro rapid v yielding to the her. ificent io
tiuence* of onr free institutions, and to
the kind'v effect# of unrestricted uncial
and commercial intercourse. An entiie
restoration of fraternal fe-lmg mu?l be the
earnest wish of everv patriotic heart ; sod
we whl have accomplished our grajnles'
national achievement when, forgetting the
sad^renls of the past, and remembering
only their instructive lessons, we resume
onr onward career as a free, prosperous
and united people.
In tttv menage of the 4 h of December,

opened for tlie enforcement of laws long

ctiRlom-hoiise* re established, and
the internal revenue law* put in force, in
order that the people might contribute to
the national income. Postal operation*
had been renewed, and efforts wer# being
made to restore litem 'o ihe'r former coo
