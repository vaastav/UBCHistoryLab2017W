New York, Dec. 15. While there
has been no positive development in

ington indications are strongly in
favor of a compromise, which will re

On account of a number of enquir
ies regarding the publication' by an
alarmist that something may happen
to the world on Wednesday, because
the planets happen to be on a line
with each other, wt are publishing
an explanation of the situation and
the statement thera is no reason to
be alarmed, from Astronomen D. T.
Wilson, of Cleveland, Ohio.
The planets are not out of their
orbits, and are moving with the same
regularity as usual, only they hap-
pen to be opposite each other, whi-'h
is something a little unusual. For
tunately for us all, the Lord is still
handling the proposition, and we
need not worry until He gets ready
to wind up the affaire of -this world
and then we may all look out. But
Atronomer Wilson says that, as is
well known, the solar system consists
of a central sun and eight planets,
of which the earth is oae revolving
around this central sun in nearly ihs
same plane, all revolving in a counter-clockwise
direction. These plan
ets are at different distances from
the sun and therefore have diffeTvnt
periods of revolution. The distance
of Mercury, the nearest planet, from
the sun, 4s 36 million miles. The
distance of Neptune, the remotest, is
2,792 million miles. The time for a
complete revolution around the sun
in the case of Mercury is. 88 days.
That of Neptune is nearly 165. days.
The time of revolution of the earth
is one yean. It is the earth's period
of revolution which determines the
length of our year. The other plan
ets are at distances ranging between
those of Mercury and Neptune and
New York, Dec. 15. The New
York county grand jury, which was
empanelled in September to investi
gate a case which was "shrouded in
mystery," has applied to Gov. Smith
for the services of another attorney
it was learned today. The demand
for assistance was based on the evi
dence secured regarding an over
shadowing crime which was not dis
closed. The only concrete matter which is
known and the public has been able
to get hold of is probably the offi
cial attitude of John P. Dobley, one
of Mr. Swan's assistants in the pro
secution of Gaston Means for tho
murder of Mrs. Maude King, which
occurred in 1917 at Concord, N. C,
for which Means was acquitted
Means charged that he was being
prosecuted by Dooley and that Swan
aided in the prosecution by allow
ing him to use the machinery of the
office of the district attorney.
Means contended that no crime
against him was alleged n New iTork
county and yet the legal machine y
or New York county was used to
prosecute him in the North Carolina
courts. The grand jury has issued
subpoenas for a number of pejplo,
among them John T. Dooiey and Al
exander Richmond.

gress and the apparent diffmmr3 of
view between the Senate and House
on the whole subject seems to point
to the possibility of. a gap between
the date of return and the date when
fresh legislation covering the whole
railroad situation is carried to the
statute books. The issue is, how
ever still in doubt. On the other
hand the adjustment of the coal sit
uation, despite the fact that much
damage has been-done through the
shortage and through the closing of
the plants, as a result of fuel restric-
tions, tends to afford a prospect of
relief to many industries whose pros
perity is dependent upon obtaining
an early supply of fuel. With im
provement thus in sight in various
departments of domestic business life
the financial situation nevertheless
continues perturbed both at home
and abroad. This state of things
should impress upon the mind of the
investor the necessity of prudence
and foresight pending fiurther devel
opments. Current developments are showing
- how serious is the trade-situation
(and consequently the financial out
look) in our relations with foreign
countries.On Dec. 11 sterling demand

Spots, Wilson
Washington, D. C, Dec. 15. Pres
ident WiAj", has intervened in the
peace treaty' dilemma with an an
nouncement that he had "no com
promise or concession of any kind in
mind," would make no move toward
CA6treaty's disposition and would
continue to hold the Republican
members of the Senate responsible
for results and conditions attend
ing delay.
The President's position regarded
as peculiarly significant in view, of
the recent discussion in the . Senate
of a compromise, was ' set forth in
the following statement issued from
the White House:
"It was learned from the highest
authority at the executive offices to
day that the hope of the Republi
can leaders of the Senate that the
President would presently make
some move which will relieve the sit
nation with regard to the treaty is
entirely without foundation; he has
no compromise or concession of any
kind in mindf but intends so far as
he is concerned that the Republican
leaders of the Senate shall continue
to bear the undivided responsibility
for the fate of the treaty and the
present condition of the world in
consequence of that fate."
The White House statement ap
parently had no effect in changing
the treaty situation. Democratic
leaders, endorsing the President's
view, "declared that it did not pre
clude a Senate compromise and that
compromise efforts would proceed.
Republican leaders reiterated that
the President was responsible for
the present status and must make
the first move toward a solution.
Senators hoping to kill the treaty
alone expressed satisfaction.
On one point only, apparently,
were all Senate factions in harmony
namely that decisive action on
the treaty probably would be defer
red until next month, after "the pro
