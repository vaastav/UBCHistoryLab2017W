Othor News of Interest from Every
where. The President's Message
Washington, Dec, 0. Special. Tho
President's messago reported short, is n
prolix document of 15,000 words. Tho
following Is a complete summary of nil
tho important points, lho President
opens with n cIIscubsIoii ofTJunadlnn soal
fishing, nnd recommends Congress to pro
vide for a commission for a joint de
marcation of tho frontier lino between
Canada and the United States.
Ho noxt taken up tho question of our
meats for export, aud states that Germany,
Denmark, Italy, Austria nnd Franco liavo
now opened their ports to our duly in
spected American hogs.
Next ho dJseuAsen briefly tho revolution
in Brazil, but offers Congress no ndvlro
Noxt comes tho Mafia trouble in New
Orleane, but offers nothing now.
Upon tho civil wnr in Chili ho makes a
long and tedious dlssi'rtatlon,closIng with
advice for uon-lntcrforonco.
Tho President next discusses the rebel
lion in China, nnd says tho Chincso gov
ernment refused to rect-Ivo Ex-Sonntor
Blair ns United States Minister to that
country, bee uiso Blair had voted to ex
cludo tho Chlnuf o from tho United States.
Hi recommends that certain Chlneso
nrtlsane with their fabrics bo admitted
freo to tho World's Fair.
Noxt hu Htrongly endorses tho Nicnrau
gua Caual projsct, by advising that tho
United States government endorso tho
bonds of tho company.
Thuu he discusses tho tariff and its ef
fect upon tho public revenues. Upon tho
goneral effect of tho McKinley bill ho
says:
"It is not now my purpose to enter nt
any iongtli into a discussion of tho effects
of tho legislation to which I havo referred,
but a brief examination of tho statistics
of tho treasury, nnd a general gloncor.t
tho atuto of business throughout tho
country will, 1 think, satisfy any impar
tial inquirer, that tho results liavo disap
pointed tho ovil prophecies of its oppo
nents, nnd in a largo measuro realized tho
hopeful predictions of its frionds. Rarely,
if ever before, in tho history of tho coun
try, has there boon a timo when tho pro
ceeds of ono day's labor, or tho product
of ono farmed aoro, would purchnso so
largo an amount of thoso things that en
tor into tho living of tho masses of tho
people. I believe that a full test will do
velop tho fact that tho tariff of tho Fifty
first Congress Is very favorable in Its nv
orago effect upon tho prico of articles en
tering Into common uso.
During thotwolvo months from October
1, 1800, to September 30, 1801, tho total
value of our foroign commercn (imports
nnd exports combined) wns $1,747,800,10(5,
which wob tho largest of nny year in tho
history of tho United States. Tho largest
in nuy previous year was in 1600, when
our commerco amounted to 51,017,130,003
und tho Inst year exceeds this enormous
nggregntebyovor ono hundred millions.
It is interesting, and to some would bo
surprising to know that during tho year
ondlng September 30, 1801, our imports of
merchandise amounted to $824,71G,370,
which was an increase of moro than clov
en tnilllondollars over tho valuo of tho
imports of tho corresponding mouths of
tho preceding year when tho Imports of
merchandise wore unusually largo in an
ticipation of tho tariff legislation then
ponding. Tho avorago nnnual valuo of
tho imports of merchandise for tho ton
years from 1881 to 1800 wis ?C02,1BC,G22,
and during the year ondlng Sep
tember 30, 1891, this nnnual
average was exceeded by 5133,628,100.
an Increaso of $02,014,021, which is nearly
throo timos tho avorago annual lucreaso
of exports of merchandlao during nny
yoar in tho history of tho government.
Tho lncroaso in tho valuo of exports of
agricultural products, during tho year re
ferred to over tho corresponding twelve
months of tho prior year, was 515,810,107,
whlio tho Increaso in tho vnluo of exports
of manufactured products was $10,838,210.
Thoro Is certainly nothing in tho con
dition of trade, foreign or domestic: thoro
ia certainly nothing in tho condition of
our pooplo of nny class, to suggest that
tho existing tariff nnd rovenuo legislation
boars oppressively upon tho peoplo or re
tards tho commorclal development of tho
nation. It may bo argued ttiat our con
dition would bo better if our tariff legis
lation wero upon a freo trade basis; but It
cannot bo denied that all tho conditions
of prosperity and of genoral contontmont
aro prt'sont In a largor dogreo than over
before In our history, and that, too, when
it was propliosled thoy would bo in tho
worse state. Agitation forradlcalchanges
In tariff and llnuucjal legislation cannot
help, but may seriously iinpodo business
to tho prosporlty of which somo tleureo of
stability In legislation Is essontlal,
I think thero am concluslvo evidences
that tho now tariff hns created several
grout Industries which will, within a few
yours gi vo employment to soverul hundred
thousand American worklngmen nnd
women. In vlow of tho aomewhat over
crowded condition of tho labor market of
tho United States, every p.ttrlotlo citizen
should rojolro at such n result.
Tho report of tho Secretary of Tronsury
shows that tho total receipts of tho gov
ernment from all sources, for tho fiscal
your ending Juno 8 1801, woro 5153,514,
283.03, whllothn oxpondlturosforthosanio
period woro W21.304.470.10 leaving n sur
plus of 537,230,702 67. s
Tho rocolpts of tho fiscal yoal ending
Juno 80. 1802, actual and ostlmntnd, aro
$133,000,000 and tho expenditures $i 0,000,
000. For tho fiscal year ondlng Juno !,
1803, tho estimated reooiptsnro $155.3,20,350
ami the expenditures $441,300,003.
Tho President noxt discusses tho silvor
question In a halting, non-committal way,
Uo does not fully ondorso tho prenout Re
publican law, but ho opposes fr o silver
coinage. Ho asks that tho prest nt law bo
glvou fair trial, thensays:
"I am still of tho opinion that tho froo
coinagoof silvor under existing condi
tions would disastrously effoct our busi
ness interests at homo and abroa '
Tho President says tho not losa of gold
during tho flscul year wob $08,000,000.
Tho President next discusses tho U.
S. Treasury and tho present fiscal policy
of tho Administration, which appears to
consist in withholding a portion of tho
billion dollars appropriated by tho last
Congress in order to savo tho Treasury
from bankruptcy.
Tho President next reviews at somo
longth tho roports of tho Secretary of War,
tho Secretary of Navy, tho Interior De
partment, the Adjutant General's bureau
and the now Agricultural Department.
This is all dry and somewhat todlous de
tails, In discussing tho Potofllco departmont
tho Prosldontsays 8,000 miles of now pos
tal sbrvlco has been established on rail
roads during tho past yoar.
Tho President says 21 new wnr ships all
iron ond steel clad nro now In process of
construction in our Navy yards and by
prlvnto contracts.
Tho President says 23,000,000 ncros of
public lands havo been wrested from tho
Indians during tho past year nnd addod to
tho publio domain, but ho does not mon
tlon any InndB that havo been wrested
from tho gigantic railroad corporations.
Tho following from tho mosaugo endors
ing Genernl Rautn'nndmluistration of tho
PetiRlon Buroati will bo of interest:
"Tho administration of tho Ponsion
Bureau lmsi been characterized by great
diligence. Tho total number of pension
ers upon tho roll on tho 30th day of June.
1801, was 070,100. There wore allowed
during tlio fiscal year ending f v iat timo
260,600 cases. Of this numb"rl02 !87 wero
allowed under tho law of Juno .'7, 1890.
Tho iisulng of certificates has ' .-n pro
ceeding at tho rato of about : 000 per
month, about 75 por cent of tb -u being
cases under tho now I" v. Tb' commis
sioner expresses tho inlon ttiathowill
bo nblo bo carefully djucat and nllow
350,000 claims till'" j tho icscnt lineal
year. Tho appro, don for tho payment
of pensions for tho l.tcnl year 1890 01 wus
$127,085,703 80 and tho unx-itnt expended
$118 630,010 25, leaving an unexpended
surplus of $9,155,141,01."
Tho estimate for pension e-xpoti '
turos for tho fiscal year ending Juliet
1803, Is $144,010,000, which, nf tor a careful
oxamluation of tho subject, tho Commis
sioner is of tho opinion will bo sufficient.
Tho President rccomtnon ib no further
pomion legislation, and doto not endorso
tho servico pension bill naked for by tho
G. A. R.
Tho President says tho cunMts buronu
is about complotn its work, nnd that tho
coustts report will be encumbered with
less essays than tho former one, and
honco, will bo moro valuable.
On tho Mormon question In Utah tho
President thinks tlio laws of Congress
havo operated to substantially suppress
open polygamy among tho laticr day
saints
Tho President thon discusses with con
siderable feeling tho late action of tho
Michigan legislature- providing for tlio
election of Presidential electors by con
gressional districts. Ho recommends tho
submission of a constitutional nmcnduipnt
to prevent tho stntcs from adopting thin
plan and providing for u uniform system
of choosing olcclo-s.
Tho President pettifogs this question nt
considerable length, but as thin matter is
loft by our constitution exclusively In
Stato contiol, It veems btrungo that tho
President should discuss it with so much
elaboration and partisan spirit.
Tho President closes his long stump
speech to Congress with this touching per
oration :
My appeal Is nnd must cnntlnuo to b?,
for a consultation that oliall "proceed
with candor, calmness and p.ttlenco upon
the lines of justice mid humanity, not of
projudico nnd cruelty."
To tho consideration of these very gravo
questions I invito not only tho attention
of Consresfi, but that of oil patriotic citi
zens. Wo must not outerUlu tho delu
sion that our t coplo havo ceased to re
gard n freo ballot und equal reproianta
tlon as tho price of their nllogiunco to
laws and to civil magistrates.
I havo been greatly rejoiced to notice
that many evidences of tlio increased uni
fication of our peoplo nnd of a revived
national spirit. Tho viotn that now opens
to us is wider and moro glorious than over
beforo.
Gratification and numzement struuglo

populution, wealth und moral strongth of

Influence upon our pooplo and upon tho
world is for a brief timo committed to us,

took placo yesterday, when tho center

building, recently occupied by Fnrwell.
Ozmun & Kirk, foil in, burylhg tlio
workmen beneath tho ruins. Thero was
supposed to havo been fifteen men be
neath tho wall at tho timo, and tho ma
jority of them wero killed or received
injuries which will probably provo fatal.
Ijjlinrnrn l'nulo Stricken.
All tho patrol wagons in tho city wer
nt onco summoned, and Chief Clark,
with Chief Jackson and Assistant Mar
tin, mado an attompt to organize tho
. i i irers who wero not under tho wall,
nnd gc. them to work removing tho
dead nnd n.j'red from beneath tho
ruins. Tho men -"ro wild with excite
ment, however, and it wns n long time
befoto half a dozen could bo induced to
go to work. Tlio others ran back nnd
forth around tho building, shoutin;; to
eacn otiior anil uttering imprecation
ngainst tho contrnctois or stood gazin
blankly at tho ruins. Tho group thar
went lo work in less than half an hour
had taken out ten men, fivo of whom
wero killed and fivo injured, ono so se
verely that tho physicians on tho ground
stated that ho could not livo until lis
reachod tho hospital.
By this timo a larger gang had bon
put to work, and tho work of romoving
tho debris went on rapidly. Finally the
contractor, Wilcox, was taken out, dead
and mangled boyond recognition. His
head appeared to bo mashed to a pulp.
Two injured wero taken to tho hospital,
and tho dead, with tho exception of onu
man, woro laid out in tho Great North
era freight house.
Hod lr Terribly Crnthod.
It was a sight novcr to bo forgotten ns
tho dead and injured wero talccu out,
somo of them crushed almost to a pulp.
Ono of tho men, supposed to havo been
a sub-foreman, was taken out in his fur
coat, nothing but his feet and limbs
being visible. His head nnd body ap
peared to bo crushed out of shape.
Thero wero men with their limbs
broken, faces bruised, and crushed oul
of all rosomblanco of humanity. Othorj
wero not so badly mangled, but had evi
dently been instantly killed by tho bric'a
falling on their heads.
Tho wounded had to ho taken or.
stretchers nnd handled very carefully in
order that tho littlo lifo remaining
might not T)o shaken out of them.
There were no groans or cries from tht
injured, as tlio poor fellows woro oxtri
cated from tho ruins by their fellow
workmen. Not ono had retained con
scionsness, howover.
...
Causo of tho Accident.
Tho causo of tho accident, as near as
can bo learned, was tho wall, which
was much weakened by tho fire, bocanu
top heavy from tho largo amount ol
dobris removed from the bottom, and
fell over of Us own weight. For some
timo it had been considered dangorons
by peoplo who frequented tho placo, but
tho contractors who examined it pro
nounced tho wall sound, nnd tho men
continuod to work without fear of acci
dent. Tho wall had appeared firm nnd
gavo no sign of weakening up to tho
timo of the fall, whou it camo down m
n heap without a second's warniug. Tho
excavations about tho baso havo been
carried on very rapidly and tlio greater
part of tho debris has been removed.

Den-ver, Col., Dec. 0. Tho trial of
Dr. Graves for tho alleged posioning of
Mrs. Josephiuo Barnaby, began yester
day in earnest. The audience room was
crowded, tho court room crowded, the
halls filled, and disappointed spectators
who wero refused admittanco oxtended
in long lines down tho stairway into
tho court yard below. When his honor
had takon his chair and tho jury had
been polled, District Attorney Stovens
stepped forward to mako tho speecli
which tho public had been expectantly
awaiting. Tlio prosecutor was inter
rupted by Judgo Macon, of the counsel
for tho defense, who made a motion
that all witnesses bo excluded from tho
court room. Tho court overruled the
application, saying that no reason was
shown why the court should enfore it nt
this time.
Then District Attomoy Stovens arose
to mako his nddres. Ho said the crime
with which Dr. Graves was accused was
tho most unique, original and cowardly
over perpetrated in tlio history of the
world. "Jerothinul B. Barnaby, the

SHALL AVE TAX HIDES?
SECRETARY RUSK EVIDENTLY HAS A
SPITE AGAINST MASSACHUSETTS.
Secretary Kiuk Itecomincnds a Duty av.
Hide to "(lot Kvcn" with tho New Kng
lund 8hoo Manufacturer Who Would
llo llenented nnd AVlm Hurt by It.
J. It. Rusk, Harrison's secretary of
agnculturo, was the only ono in tho
gloomy group around tho Whito Houso
who betrayed his conviction that na
tional issues wero involved in tho lata
MaAsachusotts fight, aud ho did it by a
silly threat.
Tho Now York Tribune reports his
remarks as follows:
"Secretary Rusk declares that tho
elections went ns ho oxpected, and ha
was not at all surprised. The only com
ment ho had to mako wns that ho would
bo in favor of restoring tho tariff on
hides, as tho Massachusetts shoo manu
facturers, for whoso benefit hides wero
put on tho freo list, had voted with tho
Democrats. Ho believed it a good idea
to mako them pay more for their hides."
Tlio secretary would punish tho shoo
manufacturers for voting in their own
interests by "taxing hides." Inciden
tally ho has another object in viow. Mr.
Rusk nover overlooks tho interests of the
"Big Four" in Chicago. Ho employs
every opportunity to say a good word
for this group of millionaires, although
ho professes to bo tho farmers' friend.
Iu 1800 tho New York Tribuno showed
clearly how a tariff on hides would op
erate. It said, "It can hardly be be
lieved that tho homo purchaser will bo
benefited by tho imposition of a duty
which would apparently help nobody so
much aa tho rich combination of beef
packers in Chicago."
And when tho houso was debating tho
grant of a tariff bonus to theso packers
by putting a duty on hides, Colonel
Bayno, a Republican member of tho
ways and means committee, said, "As
a matter of fact, tho business of hides is
largely in tho hands of such men as Phil
Armour (ono of tho 'Big Four'), who can
consign to a tannery a hundred or sev
eral hundred hides at once, and it is they
who will bo benefited by this duty
rather than tho farmer, who has only
ono or two hides to sell at a time."
Tho "Big Four" would join tho com
pany of those who now havo a tariff
bonus wero hides mado dutiable.
Equally certain would bo tho disas
trous effects of n duty on hides upon
tho tanning aud tho boot and shoo in
dustries. Said Mr. Thomas E. Proctor,
of tho Proctor Leather company, in a
communication to tho Boston Post:
"Tho only effect it would havo would
bo to increaso tho prico of shoes and cur
tail our foreign trado in bides. Tin re is
no suror way, let me tell you, to mako
Now England solidly and reliably Dem
ocratic than to put a tax on hides as
contemplated. Let mo show you how it
would work. Tho trade affected would
bo that with tho Argentine Republic and
Brazil.
"Tlio leather mado from American
hides is used in tho uppers of tho shoe.
Very little, I may say no, solo leather is
mado from American hides. To put a
tax on tho hides brought from South
America, if it had any effect at all on
shoes mado for our homo trado would bo
to increaso their price. On tho other
hand, it would materially hurt tho busi
ness of our tanners. Very much of tho
leather imported from South America is
tanned hero and shipped to England.
Now, if tills import is taxed, it will
mako it impossible for our tanners to
competo with those of Canada, who get
their hides from tho samo eourco, with
out tax and with tho advantago of un
limited honflock bark. Canadian tan
ners would derive tho benefit; our own
tanners would suffer tho loss under such
h tax.
"With us hides aro an incidental
product. If tho hido waa not sold at all
thero would bo just as mauy cattlo
raised ns thero nro now, ns tho boof and
tallow form tho main product. Wo do
not, howover, export any of our own
hides. Of tho solo leather tanned in
this country fully ono-fonrth is sent
away. To placo n tax on the leather,
that trado would bo wholly ruined, as
Canada, whero its importation is free,
would absorb it all."
By tho imposition of a duty on silver
lead oro imported from Mexico, by tho
McKinley tariff our smelting industry
waa injured and that of Mexico built
up and oncouraged. Do wo want to
repeat this foolish policy in tho caso of
our now flourishing aud prosperous tan
ning industry?
Tariff Shot.
In February, 1690, tho manufacturers
of axes in tho United States met at Buf
falo to form a trnst. Tlio outcomo of
this meeting was tho consolidation of
tho factions under tho name of tho
American Ax nnd Tool company.
On March 27, 1800, Tho Iron Ago said:
"Tho general fooling among tho trado is
that tho axmakors havo formed a vory
strong association, and havo complete
control of tho market, or so nearly so
that tho outsldo makers will liavo scarco
ly nny appreciable effect on prices. It
Is found that scarcely any orders can bo
obtained with outaido manufacturers
who aro not under tho control of tho
American Ax and Tool company, Tho
trado will do well to noto tho changed
condition in this lino of goods as regards
tho higher prices now ruling, and tho
strong probability of their maintonauco
for somo timo to como. On first quality
goods an advanco is now mado of $1.75
to $3,25 por dozen."
Beforo tho formation of this "trust"'
tho not wholesale prices of tho best
brands of first quality axes woro $5,25 to
0 por dozen, represented by
As soon ns tho "trust" was formed tho
prices wero raised as shown above by
tho Iron Ago, Tho higher prices havo
beon well maintained, for first quality
axes of tho best brands aro being sold
now by tho "trust" at 7 to $7.50 per
