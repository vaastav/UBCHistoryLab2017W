THREE NIGHT SESSIONS
For Debate Upon the Gold
Measure.
SUPPLY OF BASIC MONEY
The Cause of Fluctuatian In grosperity
During Recent Adm nistrations.
Not Enourg Gold in
the World.
Washington, Dec. 12.-There is such
great pressure for time on the part ef
the members of both sides who desire
to participate in the culrrency debate in
the house that three right sessions were
ordered to-day. Interest in the debate
is not keen, judged by the attendance
in the galleries, although the members
themselves are listening attentively to
the speeches.
Only one democrat thus far has spok
en in favor of the bill, Mr. Driggs of
New York, who announced to-day that
be had pledged himself before election
to support the gold standard and pro
posed to redeem that pledge. He will
be joined by several of his Brooklyn
colleagues and probably several ,;thers.
The features of the debate to-day
were the speeches of Mr. Grosvenor of
Ohio, for the bill, and of Mr. Cochran
of Missouri and Mr. Newlande of Ne
vada against it. The other speakers
were: Messrs. Parker of New Jersey,
William Alden Smith of Michigan,
Prince of Illinois, Lawrence of Massa
ehusetta and Powers of Vermont for
the bill, and Messrs. Shafroth of Colo
rado and Sims of Tennessee against it.
Owing to the pressure for opportunity
to speak on the democratic side, Mr.
tichardson, the minority leader, asked
that night sessions be held for the re
mainder of the week, but this was de
murred to and it was finally agreed
that night sessions for debate should
be held Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday.
Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio was the first
speaker to-day. He reviewed the dem
ocratic predictions in the last cam
paign prophesying no relief, but con
tinued falling prices and general dis
trees until free silver came and then
described how prosperity followed Mc
Kinley's election and the restoration of
confidence.
The democrats predicted that we
would have no foreign trade. That
trade was now larger than at any per
iod in our history. Another prediction
was the contraction of the -urr-ncy.
The currency has increased $400,000 in
three years. Referrin:; to the ,iqust'on
of anti-trust legia,,ltion, he challoitgd
any democrat to point ou' any addit'rn
nwhico would be made cnetitutionally
to the, Sherman anti-trust low. He d,s
e.ntr.d entirely fre n ?]r. Itr:yan r=m
ed. He contendrld 'h:t. coer-s cruid
not assail corporations in the states,
that the states could control and reg
ulate their own domestic affairs.
Mr. Newlands of Nevada followed
Mr. Grosvenor in opposition to the bill.
Be traced the history of the country
through the period of depression conm
mnencing in 1893. controding that the
panic was not caused by the coinage
of silver under the Sherman act. He
said the inrr:ose of ur.;,."alv .luring
the past two years demonstrated the
correctnoes o" the theJrv entertalouej
by bimetallists. vis.: That all other
things being equal, pr'ces vill depend
n'on the quantity if money in cihcu
lation; that an increase of the money
volume meant higher prices and the
diminution of the volume meant lower
prices.
Mr. Shafroth of Colorado. in oppostng
the bill, argued that ibe fluctuation t.f
the prosperity in the Harriso- admin
istration, the depression during the
Cleveland administration and the pros
perity under the present administra
tion lay in the supply of basic money.
During the Harrison administration
the Sherman purchasing act added
$4,000,000 a month to the supply, the re
peal of that law at the beginning of
the Cleveland administration brought
disaster and the great increase in gold
production and the consequent increase
in the basic money account for the
prosperity under the present adminis
tration.
Mr. Parker of New Jersey, in sup
port of the bill, argued that the pend
ing question should not be a party
one.
William Allen Smith of Michigan
spoke in advocacy of the bill. The
steady growth of the circulation during
the past three and a half years ag
gregating $476,000,000, gave the lie to
the advocates of free silver. Our com
merce with gold standard countries
last year aggregated $1 600,000,000; with
silver countries $139,000,000. How Idle It
would be then to jeopardize that com
merce by going on a silver basis.
Mr. Prince of Illnois, who was a
member of the banking and currency
committee in the last congress, pre
sented a careful argument in favor of
the bill.
Mr. Cochran of Missouri opposed the
bill in a vigorous speech, in which he
contended that the real question pre
sented by the nending bill was whether
there was sufficent gold In the world
upon which to pyramid the vast and
constantly increasing volume of credit
He referred to the recent dispatches
from London showing the struggle for
gold all over Europe and declaring
that the gold importations during the
McKinley administration had produced
the gold famine abroad. There was not
enough gold in the wor'd to do the
business of the worl.,. The imports of
gold to pay for the surplus crops ex
ported to supply the failur' of crops
abroad, Mr. Cochran c'a'rned had
quickened trade and had pr diced toe
prosperity of which the repuhica-os
boasted to-day. He warn-d the renub
licans that when the stock of gold d,
edined the prosperity of to-day would
crumble like a house of cards. In the
course of his speech. when Mr. Cochran
reiterated Mr. Bryan's famous doc'ara
tion concerning the crown of thorns
and cross of gold, the republicans
jeered derisively.
Mr. Simpson, in opposition, said un
der the existing prosperity wages d'd
not average more than 10 per cent
above the panic level, whl'e the price
of manufactured goods had increased
100 per cent.
Mr. Driggs of New York was the first
democrat to speak in favor of the bill.
When he rose. many of the roeublicans
left their seats and went over to tOe
democrntie side to l'stin. He said that
the convention which nominated him
did not indorse the Chicago platform,
nor did It indorse either -old or silver.
As the nominee he was left to follow
his own convictions.
On the 29th of October and again on
the day preceding the eltct'on he an
nounced in the Brooklyn paPers that he
favored the gold standard and If elect
ed. gave his pledee thant he would sup
port gold standard lecislation.
Continuing. Mr. Driggas declared he
believed the dienity and ore-emtnenen
of the TTntted States would he advanced
by placing this country upon the stand
ard of the most highly e.villise s esa
tries of the world.
"I do not arrogate to myself," said
he, addressing his democratic col
leagues. "the presumption to say to
you that I am right and you are
wrong, but I believe as a democrat that
you would respect me less if., knowing
how I feel. I should not openly avow
my convictions and keep the pledges 1
made."
Mr. Driggs announced that he would
remain a consistent democrat save
only upon the question of free coln
age.
Mr. Powers of Vermont and Mr. Law
rence of Massachusetts supported the
bill.
Upon Mr. Cannon's motion a resolu
tion was adopted directing the speak"r
to appoint a committee of 10 to join
the committees appointed by the presi
dent and senate to prepare plans for
the celebration of the cent-nnial anni
versary of the first congress held in
Washington. It was then agreed that
the sessions of the house durng the
continuance of the general debate on
the currency bill should begin at 11
o'clock.
Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio announced the
death of the late Repree-'tative Dan
forth of Ohio, and at 5 o'clock, as a
further mark of respect, the house ad
journed.
iN THE SENATE.
Pettigrew Has a Lively Colloquy With
Senator (hhandler.
Washington, Dec. 12.-Whether Admiral
Dewey, acting for the United States gov
ernment, formally or informally recog
nized the Philippine republic at Manita is
a question which Mr. Pettigrew of South
Dakota desires the navy department to
answer.
Me introduced a resolution to-day di
recting the secretary of the navy to sup
ply the senate with information on the
subject, but Mr. Chandler of New I-mp
shire objected to its immediate consid
eration. Following this objection, Mr.
Pettigrew and Mr. Chandler had a sharp
tilt over the resolution offered yesterday
by the former demand'ng from the secre
tary of war an explanation of certain
charges against General Merriam in his
conduct of the Coeur d'Alenes troubles.
Politics were interjected into the contro
versy and the personal references made
by each senator against the other lit
some liveliness to an otherwise quiet ses
sleon.
At the opening of to-day's session reso
lutions were reported favorably from the
committee on contingent expeneec, au
thori.lng the committee on privileges and
elections to proceed with the invcstiga
tiuns of the election to the senate of \V.
A. Clark of Montana and N. B. Scott of
West Virginia. The resolutions were
adopted.
Mr. Cullom's bill providing a form of
government for Hawaii was sent to the
committee on foreign relations.
Mr. Pettigrew of South Dakota offered
the following resolution:
"That the secretary of the navy be and
he is hereby directed to inform the son
ate whether the flag of the Phillppine re
public was carried by vessels in the bay
of Mainla. and whether the flag of the
Philippine republic was ever saluted by
Admiral Dewey or any of the vesse:s of
his fleet at any time since May 1. ICS:
were Spanish prisoners delivered over to
the Philippine forces et the time of the
surrender at Subig bay; did a vessel com
manded by the forces under Aguinaldo,
flying the Philippine flag, accompany the
vessels Concord and Ralcigh back to So
big bay in June. 1898. in order to compel
the surrender of the Spanish forces?"
Mr. Pettigrew asked for immediate con
esderation of the resolution, but Mr.
Chandler objected and it went over until
tn-mnrrnw.
The resolution offered yesterday by Mr.
Pettigrew, reciting certain things alleged
to have been done by General Merriam in
connection with the trouble in the Coeur
d'Alenes mining district, and directing the
secretary of war to transmit to the senate
all orders and information in his posses
sion bearing upon the suobject, was laid
before the senate.
Mr. Chanoler of New Hampshire object
ed to the statements in the preamble of
the resolution and desired to offer a sub
stitute, but Mr. Pettigrew declined to ac
cept the substitute.
"Although I am not certain whether my
friend, the senator from New Hampshire,
is a republican," said he, "I am satisfied
that any substitute he may offer is per
nicious. as he himself often is."
Mr. Chandler-It requires a pernicious
senator some times to deal with a perni
cious proposition.
Mr. Pettigrew-That's the reason, I sup
pose, why you are trying to deal with
this.
Mr. Chandler secured the reading of his
substitute, which, he pointed out, elimi
nated only the charges made in the orig
inal against General Merriam, and, in his
opinion, would serve much better the pur
pose of Mr. Pettigrew than the original.
Mr. Pettigrew in reply declared the ac
tion of General Merriam was a disgrace
to civilization, but he was perfectly
willing that the republican party should
take the responsibility of it.
Mr. Chandler-The repub'ican party has
its faults, perhaps, hut I am much more
willing to remain with it since the sena
tor from South Dakota left it.
He then read a paragraph from General
Merriam's report to the war department
bearing upon the Coeur d'Alene trouble.
Indicating that the officer had acted with
justice and discretion.
Mr. Pettigrew asked that the resolution
and amendment be referred to the com
mittee on education and labor, but Mr.
Hawley of Connecticut, chairman of the
committee on military affairs, objected.
The resolution was referred to the com
mittee on military affairs.
After an executive session a message
from the house was presented announc
ing the death of Repreesntative Daniel
Ermentrout of Pennsylvania. and on mo
tion of Mr. Penrose the senate, at 1:40 p.
m., as a mark of respect, adjourned.
CULLOM'S BILL

Washington, Dec. 12.-Benator Cullom
to-day introduced In the senate a com
prehensive bill for an amendment to the
law creating the interstate comm-ree

AT THEIR ANNUAL. OW
Winter Meeting of the National
Baseball League.
A HOT TIME IS EXPECTED
There Has Been No End of Lobbying
M. mb rs Are Armed or Bitter
Attact-Many Schemes
on Hand.
New York, Dec. 12.-To-day marked
the beginning of the annual winter
meeting of the National League at the
Fifth Avenue hotel. Armed for an
especially bitter attack, the members
were all on hand, but so much time
was consumed by the board of arbitra
tion that the league only met to carry
out the requirenients of the constitu
tion and immediately adjourned.
Not in years, not since the end of
the famous brotherhood fight, has a
league meeting been fraught with so
much importance as the one just be
gun. For weeks past there has been
no end of lobbying and wire pulling
among the various club owners, for all
the avowed purpose of reducing the
circuit and purifying the national
game. Several of the minor teams were
also represented.
It is not believed probable that the
proposed scheme for a reduction in the
league circuit will go through. The
situation as summed up by one of the
baseball men to-night, was this:
"Louisville and Cleveland will sell on
fair terms. Wagner wants big money
for his franchise In Washington, and
the Brooklyn-Baltimore syndicate
wants theearth for the Oriole franchise.
Who, is going to put up all this money?
The league? Well, I hope not."
For more than five hours to-day the
members of the national board of ar
bltration of the National League of
Baseball clubs argued as to the merits
of the Wr!gley controversy, in which
the New York, Brooklyn and Syracuse
clubs are involved.
At the conclusion of the conference
it was announced that a resolution had
been adopted declaring that the Syra
cuse club had no right to control Wrig
ley's services after his contract had
terminated with that club. In a word,
the act;cn of the board of arbitration
was a blow at the minor league clute,
as this ruling means that any national
league club may take the players of
the minor league club at the end of
their season, which is one month ear
lier than that of the big league, and
try them out without paying any
money consideration to the club to
which the player is under reserve. The
fact that the minor league clubs may be
dickering with another club for the
sale of the player makes no difference.
The Wrigley fight was a three-cor
nered one between New York. Brook
lyn and Syracuse. At the conclusion of
the Eastern league season Wrigley
signed to finish the season with New
York. A few days later he was soln by
Syracuse club to Brooklyn, and, acting
under the advice of President Powers.
Wrigley went to Brooklyn anl. finished
the season.
To-nrr.rrow the board of threctors
will consider the appeal made by the
New York club to have the Brooklyn
management disciplined for playing
Wrigley when he had signed the New
York contract. What will be done is
problematical.
IT IS A WARM FIGMT.
Bryan May Be the Comp-omtse Ap
pointee in Nebraska
Omaha, Neb., Dec. 12.-The senatorial
situation Is daily becoming more com
plicated and there are those who claim
that the appointment of either Allen
or Hitchcock will disrupt the party and
that the governor will be compelled
either to appoint a dark horse or con
cede to the request made by Orlando
Teft, chairman of the state republican
committee and call a special session of
the legislature to settle the matter.
Governor Poynter returned to Lincoln
to-day, accompanied by a delegation of
Hitchcock men. On his arrival at the
state house he was besieged by a
-orde of friends of both Hitchco'k and
Allen. The governor put in the day
locking over the mail and telegrams
that accumulated during his absence
and in giving a hearing to the politi
cians. He intimated during the day
that he may announce the name of
Hayward's successor to-morrow. Some
think that Bryan will be appointed.
basing their belief upon the fact that
the morning Hayward died the gov
ernor was cle-aeted for several hours
with Charles W. Bryan, brother of W.
J. Bryan. All sorts of rumors are
afloat here and in Lincoln to-night and
everybody will be glad when it is
over.

San Juan de Porto Rico, Dec. 13.-Gov
ernor General Davis has issued an order
governing the disp'ay of flags in Porto

Seattle, Wash., Dec. 12.-The federal
grand jury adjourned to-day without
taking any action on the charge that
the name of William Eldrldge had been
forged to the official bond of ex-Col
lector of Customs J. C. Saunders. It
was stated to-day that any prosecu
t:on for the alleged forgery was bar-ed

the crime, if a crime it was, was com
mitted in 1593.

MANY LIVES LOST IN
A TIDAL WAVE
F.Ve Thousand People Perished on the
Island o' Coram-Coast .or
Miles Trans ormed.
San Franclsco, Dcc. 12.-The Bulletin
says: The disaster that overtook the
Island of Coram on the second of last
month cost the people of that district
immense loss in lives and property.
The steamship America. Maru, which
arrived yesterday, brought advices from
Coram and reports that 5,000 people
were destroyed on that is;and alone
when the dreadful earthquakes of
November shocked the Japan coast and
agitated the lands adjacent to the em
pire.
On the night of the second the people
of Coram were awakened by a terrific
shock of earthquake that seemed to
work from north to south. Every one
fled from their houses and btook up
places in the public square. A few hours
later is was reported the water was
rising in the bay of Ambonia. The sea
came forward in the shape of a huge
tidal wave and forced the water into
the bay entrance. It came up 50 feet
over the lowlands. At Paupoly and
Samasoeroa, on the bay, the waves
swrept over the tops of trees 30 feet
high.
Out of nearly 1,800 inhabitants, only
40 escaped.
The whole coast for miles was trans
formed into a huge mud puddle.
Corpses were everywhere. Broken trees
and portions of houses were buried in
the ooze. Every few reds were great
lumps of stones and boulders that had
been washed up from t,.e sea changing
the entire topography of the country.
The exact number killed along the coast
will never be known, as the bod'es are
buried many yards under new ground.
FEDERATION OF LABOR. p
Susan B. Anthony Made an Appeal for ti
Woman Sunirage. 5i
Detroit, Mich., Dec. 12.-T,.e question ti
of the seating of a single delegate occu
pied the American Federation of Labor
convention the greater part of to-day's
session. The case in polnt is that of n
W. H. Bell, delegate of the Oni.ha Cen- p
tral Labor union. The convention ad- V
journed without having reached an
agreement on the question.
During the afternoon the delegates
had a diversion listening to Miss Susan
B. Anthony, wsho made an appeal to
the federation to join in a petition to
congress to reef r to the state legisla
tures for indorspnment a proposed 16th
constitutional a iidment providing for t
enfranchisement of women.
The executive council of the federa
tion reported its doings for the year.
The report stated that the Brewery
Workers still retained some of the sta
tionary engineers in their unions, not
withstanding the executive council had t
declared that the two should be sepa- j
rated. A similar state of affairs ex
isted between the brewers and coopers.
Controversies between local unionA of i
shoemakers and their national organ
ization were reported to be in process
of amicable adjustment.
The council had been unable to ad
just the differences between the fac
tions of the painters' associations. The
bricklayers had approved a proposition
for affiliation with the federation. The
council reported adversely on the re
quest of the bartenders to form a sepa
rate union instead of being affiliated I
with the waiters and restaurant em
ployes. The reports said the typo
graphical and printing machinists'
unions are still at variance, the former
having decreed the latter must be mem
bers of their organization, which action
the machinists refused to indorse. The
council expressed disapproval of the
sending out of boycott circulars by any
local or national union without'hav!ng
first referred the matter to the federa
tion. On recommendat'on of the reso
lutions committee the executive council
was empowered to take action in inves
tigating the Idaho labor military
troubles. A flood of resolutions w ,re
introduced, covering nearly every sub
J.ct of interest to labor in this coun
try.
Miss Susan B. Anthony asked per
mission to address the convention and
was accorded a half hour of the after
noon session.

24 hours, with high winds continuing.
A Total Wreck.
Sandusky, Ohio, Dec. 12.-The steam
er Point Abino, coal laden, went ashore
on Ballast island reef to-day and will
probably be a total wre-r. She Ic

Are Closely Affi lated With

Washington, D. C., Dec. 8.-The populist
party of the present congress has a
smaller representation than at any time
in 10 years, but it makes up in ability
and energy for what it lacks in numbers.
Judge John C. Bell of Colorado, now be
ginning his fourth term in the house. is
the leader of the party and the chairman
of its caucus. He was also again the can
didate of the party for the speakership,
an honor for which he was twice before
selected. He has had an extensive ex
perience in the house and is one of the
ranking members of the committee On ap
propirations, one of the principal commit
tees of the body. Judge Pell will be 48
years old next Monday. He is a native
of Tennessee and a kinsman of John Bell.
He has lived In Colorado for a quarter of
a century, and was from the first prom
inent in Southern and Western Colorado.
He was formerly a democrat, but has
been ,uentified with the populist party for
10 years. He is highly regarded in the
house and is recognized as one of the
strongest and ablest members.
Representative Edwin Ridgely of Kan
sas is the only populist that survived the
last Kansas e:ection. He was chosen by
the populist caucus to nominate Mr. Bell
for the speakership. Mr. Ridgely is a na
tive of Wabash county. Ill., and is now
55 years old. He served through the war
of the rebellion as a private in Company
C, 115tn Illinois volunteer infantry. In
1896 he moved to Girard. Kan., where.
with a brother, he engaged in genera1
merchandiling under the firm name of
Ridgely Bros.. and has conducted this
bu.iness continnously since. In the early
seventles he engaged In the Texas cattle
trade, personally sharing in and direct
long the gathering of cattle on the range
and driving them to the Kansas markets.
Subsequently he extended his operations
to the Pncific coast, including Washing
ton territory, Oregon and California. He
was a resident of Ogden, .tah, from 1889
to 1893. His first vote was cast for U. S.
Grant In 1868. but he left the republican
party in 1876 because of its financial poll
ey and became a greenbacker. In his au
tobigraphical strketch in the new congres
stonal directory Mr. Ridgely says: "Con
tinoously from 1876 he has advocated the
exclusive issue of all money by the gov
ernment by using all the gold and silver
I offered as material on which to print the
money power, supplementing these with
paper to regulate and control the total
volume: that no money should be a prom
Ise to pay, to be redeemed by some other
money, hut all money should be full le
gal tender, the volume to be limited and
its value to be kept uniform by keep!ng
the volume up to a fixed ratio to the vol
ume of all property in the nation: Is an
earnest advocate of pub'cl ownership and
operation of all public utilities, and thinks
it both a necessity and duty of the state
to supply all unemployed people voluntary
access to all the necessary means of pro
duction and distribution among them
selves of food, fuel, clothing, shelter and
education; that all such labor above the.e
needs should be utilized by the state In

Nebraska sends a camfortale daelega
tion of three populists. Two of them
served In the last congress. William L
Stark of Aurora is a native of Connecti
cut, now 46 years old. He afterward lived
in Illinois and studied law at Chicago.
He has lived in Nebraska for 20 years,
and served for several terms as a county
judge. He is a careful and earnest leg
islator. Congressman Roderick Dhu
Sutherland, a native Iowan, now 37 years
old, is also serving his second term. He
was three terms county attorney beforq
he came to congress. He was chairman
of the populist state convention whicn
nominated this year's winning ticket In
Nebraska. He comes from a strong pop
ulist district and is believed to be sure
of serving in congress several more
terms.
The new populist member of the house
from Nebraska is Judge William Neville
of North Piatte. He was born in Wash
ington county, Illinois, Dec. 29. 1843. and
removed to Chester, in Randolph county
in 1851. He was educated at McKendree
college, Lebanon, Ill., was second ser
geant in Company H. 1424 Illinois infan
try in the civil war. He Is a veteran pol
itician and was elected to the Illinois
leeislature as a democrat In the fall or
1872. He removed to Nebraska In May,
1874. and was elected to the Nebraska
legislature from Omaha in the fall of 1876.
He was the democratic and anti-monon
oly candidate for congress in 1894. In
1891 Mr. Neville was elected judge of the
Thirteenth judicial district for a four
n-are' term. He was nominated and
elected supreme judge by a 15,000 majority
in 1898, but the ofice being contingent
upon the adoption of a constitutional
amendment, which failed to carry, he did
not take a seat upon the supreme bench
He had 3.000 majority last November as
a candidate for congress to fill the va
cancy occasioned by the death of Judge
W. L. Greene.
Representatlve John Wilhur Atwater
ls the only populist in this house from
North Carol'na, a state that had nearly
a solid populist delegation last congress.
The p-pu!lits from the Tarheol state in
the Fifty-fifth conrr-es were the product
of a republican-populist fus!on. Mr. At
water was elected on a democratic-popu
list fulion ticket, defeating Joseph J.
Jenkins. who ran on a renuhllcan-popu
list fusion ticket. He is a native of North
Carolina. He served in the confederate
army, Company D of the let North Caro
lina volunteers, and was with the army
of General R. E. Lee until the end. He
joined the Farmers' Alliance in 1887: was
elected the first president of his county
alliance; was elected state senator In
1890 as an Alliance democrat, and again
in 1892 and in 1898 as a popul!st: was
elected chairman of the populist caucus.
In his sketch he says:
"I did all I could to keep the charters
of the towns and eitiec from being
changed and to keep them from being
dominated by negroes. I am a great ad
mirer of William J. Bryan."
All the pOPu'!sts in the house are close
ly affiliated with the demoerats and sliver
republicane, forming a compact minority
organization. HOSFORD.

AN OLD MAN'S PIPE
Responsible for the Terrible Mine Disas
ter at Carbonadlo.
Carbonado, Wash., Dec. 1.--Funeral
services over 23 victims of the mine ac
cident were held to-day. Coroner Holka
begins the inquest to-morrow.
Developments during the day proved
that old man Ben Zedler's tobacco pile
had been responsible for the disaster
and the 28 fresh graves. Foreman
Robert Cox' gang found Zedler's corn
cob pipe and a bag containing abdut
two ounces of strong cut tobacco early
this morning near-where his corpse was
discovered the evening previous by
Foreman Lewis' body-searching party.
From all appearances the old man had
just filled his pipe preparing for a
smoke and had opened his safety laibp
to get a light. He never knew what
happened afterwards.
Reese Jones' remains were also dis
covered early this morning by Cox's
gang. A right leg is missing, having
been blown to atoms and one side of
his face and head was frightfully shat
tered.
State Mine Inspector Ownes said to
night: "The indications are that the
open lamp of Ben Zedler, ar., caused
the exploelon."
An explosion due to black powder
was reported from Burnett to Acting
Mine Inspector Little this forenoon by
messenger from Superintendent C. H.
Burnett. John Krook, a miner there,
tried to open a 25-pound keg with a
pick and the powder exploded, burning
him and companion, John Monther, al
most fatally. This occurred some time
during the night in one of the tunnels.

view to-day W. J. Bryan expressed
himself upon the financial bill now be
fore the house. He said:
"Following the line of the president's
message, congress is at present consid
ering a bill that is an extremely bod
measure. I refer to the financial bill
now under discussion in the house. This
hill is a very bad one indeed. It is a
part of the gold standard people's plan
and I hope that it will be defeated. It
should certainly never be permitted to
pass the house, because it is not in the
interest of democracy."

SAVE THEIR RAILROAD FARES.
Expedlents by Wh'ch Dishonest Travelers
Heat Their WVy.
From the Kansas City Times.
There was a man in town yesterday
who told of a new scheme he has just
worked to beat a railroad. "A frienid
of mine and myself wanted to come
from Omaha to Kanan City. He said
to me: 'You buy a ticket only to the
first station and I will show you a
good trick.' I bought the ticket as re
quested, while my friend bought a
ticket for the full distarce at the regu
lar fare. We took a seat together, in
the train. The conductor came around,
took up the tickets and put a punched
train check in my friend's hat, indicat
ing that he was ticketed through to
Kansas City. When the conductor got
out of sight my f:iend took his knife
and split the card. He put half into
my hat and the other into his own.
Both 'splits' looked like a regular
check and I came right on through
without paying any more fare. We
divided the saving, which was more
than $2 each."
A railroad man who heard the story
said that it was as cleverly conceived a
scheme to rob the railroads as the
one which it is said a few traveling
men used to practice in the days when
2-cent mileage books were more gener
ally used than at present. That
scheme wasa to go into the car early and
run a string along under the seats.
One man would sit in the forward end
of the car with the mileage hook. After
the conductor had toen out the mileage
he would tie the book to the string and
his confederate a few seats back would
draw it to himself under the seats.
When the conductor got to him he
would have the mileage book all right
and coupons for his passage would b
torn therefrom by the unsuspecting
conductor. The conspi-ators would
save a cent a mile by this scheme.

Roberts Committee Is Consider
ing Prooedure.
HE HAS FILED HIS BRIEF
Agotes That t·e Constitution Gives Pro
ti n Agaisnst Trial Without Pro
Cbs of Law-Publio Bearings
Soon to Begin.
Washington, Dee. 11.-The Roberts
investikation committee resumed its
seesion to-day behind closed doors.
This, it was e4plined, was to permit
the obmnmltteS to rtooeve and discuss
reports on ptocedure, form of sub
pena, etc. Meantime Mr. Roberts him
self, and a gathering of Mormons and
Gentiles. stood oUtside the committee
door awaiting Admission.
LMr. Roberts was prepared to continue
his argument on the demurrer to the
right of the eomnlittee to try him.
1$ tenitlle delbiation waq more nu
m#rous, including the white haired
R4V. Dr. Iliff, Mr. Schroeder. to whom
Roberts inter ped rather sensational
ob ions batLr5ay, and the others
wn ,h&ve come h from Utah to direct
the proceeding against him.
TIhs commiitee remained in private
siion until noon, when an adjourn
mk4t was taken until 10 o'clock to
mio~iow, whei the actual hearing of
witnetses will begin. Mr. Roberta saw
Mr. Taylor as soon as the committee
adjoLaned and submitted his brief.
Mr. Roberts' .brief is a lengthy legal
argument agatint the rights of the
committee. He urges thap the oonsti
tution gives protection against Lrlal
without the process of law; also against
taJting property such as the salary of
ofhoe without due process of law.
Mr. Roberts' answer is as follows:
From the foregoing established doc
trines and rights of members of con
gress it follows:
That the proposed proceedings of this
committee would be subversive of the
rights of the member from Utah.
First-In that he is to be adjudged
guilty of crime without due process of
law.
Second-That be is to be adjudged
disqualified by disabilities created by
enactments of congress and applicable
to the old territory of Utah, but not
applicable to the state of Utah, which
disabilities have been removed (by
amnesties of two presidents, by the en
ablint act passed by congress, by the
transltion of Utah from a territorial
condition to that of statehood.
Third-It further appears that the
crime alleged against the representa
tive from Utah does not constitute a
disqualiflcation for a member of con
gresa unless the house and Its commit
tee appeared to assert their power and
right to add to the qualifications pre
scribed by the constitution of the Unit
ed States.
Fourth-And, further, the proposed
proceedings by this committee would
deprive the member from Utah of the
constitutional right to a trial by a
court of competent jurisdiction and by
a jury of his peers within the state
and district where the' crime is alleged
to have been committed and ývould
deprive him of property and rights
without due process of law.
The member from Utah, therefore,
aski the committee to stop its present
proceedings and consider the prima fa
cle right of the representative from
Utah to be sworn in as a member of
the house of representatives of the
Fifty-sixth congress.
As to the protests by certain secta
rian ministers from Utah Itpberts holds
that the committee ought not to con
sider them for the reason that -the
affidavits presented by them bear dates
as follows:
"Thomas J. Brandon, Feb. 13. 1899;
Ray T. Brandon, Feb. 13, 1899; Luella
P. Miles, Feb. 27, 1899: Mrs. Marie E.
MeDougall, May 27, 1899: all dates be
ing several months prior to the de
parture of the repreeentative from
Utah for the East. More than a year
after the charges began to be made
against the member from Utah was in
and about Salt Lake all the time, and
seven months after the Brandon affi
davits were drawn up by A. T. Schroed
er and therefore said protestants had
ample time to institute proceedings be
fore the courts of Utah, which were
and are open for the prosecution of the
charge made in the past. If the prot
estants have sufficient evidence they
should have established the guilt of the
member from Utah as to the misde
meanor charged and come here with a
court record and bring their charges,
although the question would be debata
ble as to whether the misdemeanor
alleged, if proven, would be sufficient
to bar him from the house, and on that
subject the member from Utah has
already expressed his belief and pre
sented arguments. The member from
Utah asks that he be allowed to take
the oath of office."
