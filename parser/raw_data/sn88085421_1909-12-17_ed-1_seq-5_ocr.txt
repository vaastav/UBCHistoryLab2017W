Summer Rash Became a Dreadful

ALMOST MAGIC CURE
BY CUTICURA REMEDIES
Our son, two years old, was very
much afflicted with a breaking outer
what looked to bo a summer rash. I
applied the usual remedies, such as
washing with soda water and powdering
with bone acid. Finally, after he suf
fered with tlie trouble several weeks I
took him to the doctor. He said it was
merely a rash that was quite prevalent,
and that I was giving the right treat
ment and that f should just continue it
and the baby would soon be all right.
But instead of getting better it was get
ting worse. The rash ran together and
made large blisters. The little fellow
didn't want to do anything but scratch
and we had to wrap his hands up to
keep him from it as he would tear the
flesh open till the blood would run. The
itching was intense, causing loss of appe
tite and flesh. When it seemed to hurt
him most the skin on his back became
hard and rough like the bark of a tree so
that rubbing or brushing would not
break it. He was so feverish that I
thought it a bad case of eczema. He
could not wear any clothes but a little
nightgown with the sleeves just fastened
at the top of the shoulder. He suffered
intensely for about three months. But
I found a remedy in Cuticura Soap for
bathing and Cuticura Ointment with
which I anointed the sore places. This
kept the rash from spreading and in less
than a week the result was almost magi
cal. That was more than two years ago
and there has not been the "slightest
symptom of it since he was cured. lam
never very long without Cuticura Soap
as my family knows the value of it and
don't like a substitute. J. W. Lauck,
Yukon, Okla., Aug. 28 and Sept. 17, 'OS."
Millions of women throughout the
world use Cuticura Soap and Ointment
for eczemas, rashes, itchings, irritations,
inflammations, chafings, pimples, black
heads, dandruff, dry, thin and falling
hair, sanative*, antiseptic cleansing, and
for all the purposes of the toilet, bath

KANSAS CITY
IN TROUBLE
(Continued From Page One)
rounding- suburbs there were about a
hundred drinking places no different
from those to be found in any "wet"
| community. From these "joints" was
| derived a large part of the revenue of
j the city. For a time the mayor, and po
lice department, backed by the entire
city government and the popular sen
timent of a majority of the people, de
fied the state authorities.
Some two years ago ouster suits
brought against the mayor and other
Pittsburg officials by the state in the
supreme court and a judgment m
ouster w-as rendered and permanent
injunctions granted restraining the of
j flcials from collecting fines from the
! jointists and giving police protection
;in return. later word reached Attor
j ney Jackson that the injunction was
j being violated. Investigation showed
that Frank Linski, acting as a go-be
tween for the city officials and the
jointists was collecting money from
MAX FIGMAN In Scene From the New York—Chicago Comedy Success, 'MAR/ JANE'S PA" At the Keylor Gra rcl khcattd 18.
the jointists and cashing city war
rants for policemen and firemen. They
were arrested and 21 convictions ot
officials and jointists for contempt of
court were secured.
Since then the crusade has contin
ued without intermission. Many joint
ists have been sent to jail. Liquor Is
still being sold here, but it is of the
vilest possible quality, and unpreju
diced persons declare that this fact is
largely responsible for the crime wave
which has swept over the section.
Pittsburg is an industrial and mining
city, with a large foreign population,
largely addicted to drink. Those who
formerly drank beer in the open sa
loons are now driven to indulgences
in cheap "forty-rod" whiskey.
Another arraignment against the
prohibition-enforcers is that the city,
shut off from a large revenue provided
by the joints, is unable to employ suf
ficient police and firemen, leaving the
town at the mercy of criminals and a
possible conflagration.
Not long ago robbers broke into a
house only five blocks from the busi
ness section, snatched the diamond ear
rings from the ears of a sleeping girl
and then forced her to drink carbolic
acid, causing her death. Only a short
time before a woman was assaulted
and murdered, and her husband and
child slain. Other crimes have oc
curred frequently, and the people are
terrorized.
FATHER LEAVES

that he had just arrived and was not
able to get any money at the banks
as it was too late, borrowed the sum
of $5.
First indications that these places
of business had regarding the dishon
esty of the man were gleaned when
the time for the .*-st payment was
near. These he totally disregarded and
it was when assured that he did not
moan to pay for them, that the goods
were taken back. Both the wagon and
phonograph were reclaimed yesterday
and when the agents for these com
panies arrived at Heifer's home/they
discovered that he had left.
It was tnen ascertained that, he had
left his family absolutely destitute,
even taking the small hoard of pennies
that the children had saved up. In
all he is supposed to have made away
with about $90 and this small sum was
all that stood between the family and
actual want.
Neighbors of these people are tak
ing care of the destitute family.

BOTH PARTIES

portant point."
Bryan declared it is pain that the
coming special messages will not sug
gest anything, not acceptable to the
"special interests."'
"The president says the Sherman
anti-trust law needs amendment," says
Bryan. "He is mistaken, it needs en
forcement."
LaFollette Talks.
MADISON, Wis., Dec. 17.— If Pres
ident Taft expects to put forward the
Roosevelt policies he will do well to go
about it prompt'y and not leave con- I
gress and the people to infer, as well
they may after the expedience of the
last extra session, that he is waiting
for the appearance of the Aldrich and
Cannon program."
Thus Senator LaFollette closes hi~
editorial in his weekly magazine to
day, sharply criticising President Taft
and his recent message to congress.
LaFollette sarcastically indicates
that it is his belief that the president
is drawing away from the po'icies of
his predecessor. He calls attention to
the brevity of the message to the spe
cial session saying, "Every where
thoughtful men were anticipating a
great state paper." Regarding the last
message to comefro m. the White
House, LaFollette comments that he
was "silent where he should have
spoken more strongly." The senator ,
declares the people are anxious to see
the definite official form of Taft's
wishes regarding legislation.
"The tariff was a bad job," he con
tinues, "and the Ballinger situation
grows more tense as the truth is
known."
Husband Now
i I
| Is Locked Up
i Charged with living off the earn
ings of his wife. Thomas May, who
was the cause of her arrest several
days ago, was himself placed under
lock and key last night upon informa
tion furnished Prose, uting Attorney
Everett J. Smith. It is said that Mrs.
May, who was accused of living In
malicious cohabitation with Gus
Arndt had converted her house. 513
West Birch street into one of ill re
pute and the proceeds derived from
tnis nefarious business were used by
i
the husband.
Arndt, who was arrested last Sat
urday night upon the complaint of
I May, later made what he termed a full
! confession to the sheriff and this in
volved May to such an extent that he
was also apprehended. The. particu
: lars of this confession are the most
1 revolting that have ever come to light
in this country and the exact circum
: stances are too horrible to make pub
he. j
As a result much more serious
j charges may be lodged against the
I father and mother a3 well as Arndt.
! Startling developments are looked for
!at the tria , but If much of the cvi
! dence is brought out the trial will
j doubtless be held behind closed doors,
i The series of crimes said to have
j been perpretrated in the May home
j are unparale'led in the history of this
I county. Arndt, it is said, is going on
j the stand at the trial, next Febru
i ary and will make a ' clean breast." of
I what he knows. Both Mr. and Mrs.
j May deny the truth of Arndt's con
! fession.
When Deputy McAl'ister went to
i the May home yesterday, the three
i.children, one aged 5. the second aged
j7, and the other aged 11, were at
1 home. He had a neighbor stay with
j the children last night and they will
probably be cared for in some way to
day. Startling facts in connction with
the alleged debauching of the chil
dren at the instance of the parents,
it is likely, will be brought out at
the trial.
