MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT

AT THE
Coinineticeuient of (he Second
leiiUn of the XXXIXth
Congress.
FelhwcHiMrnt o ihf SrkaU
and lloutr nf Jtfprarntatiret:
After a brief interval the (J .tijrrrss of the
TJsited State resumes its annual legislative
. ' labors. An a"l-wis nd merciful Provi
dence has abated the pestilence which, visit
ed our chores, leaving its calamitous traces
upon some portions of our count ry. Pence,
order, tranquility, aim civil authority have
beet! formally declared to exist throughout
the whole of the United States. ' In ail of
iKe States civil authority has superseded
the coercion of arms, and the people by
their voluntary ao'inn, are. maintaining their
governments in full activity atd complete
operation. The enlbrrement of the laws is
no longer "obstructed in any State by com
binations too powerful to be suppressed, by
the ordinary course ol judicial proceed ines;"'
and the animosities engendered by the war
are rapidly yielding lo the henificent in
fluences of our free institutions, and to the
kindly effects of unrestricted social and
commercial intercourse. An entire restora
tion of fraternal feeling must be the earnest
wish of every patriotic heart; and we wnl
have accomplished our grandest national
achievement when, forgetting the sad
itvcnts of tho past, and remembering only
their instructive lessons, we resumo our
onward career as a free, prosperous, and
united people.
In my message on the 4ih of December,
18bf, Consres was informed of the meas
ures which bad 1 een instituted by the Exe-
xsutivc with a view to the gradual restoration
of tru States iu which the insurrection oc
curred to their relations with the General
Government Provisional Governors had
teen appoint! d, Conventions called, Gov
ernors elected, legislatures afse:ubled. and
Senators and Representatives chosen to the
Orngress ot the United States. Courts ba-f
been opened for the enforcement ot the la- s
Jong in abeyance. The blockade had been
removed, custom-houses re-established, and
the internal revenue Inws put in force, in
Older that the people niigtt contribute to
zhe national income. Postal operations bad
4in restored, and efforts were being made
so restore them to their foimer condition of
orffiekocy. The States themselves had been
asked -to take part in the high function of
.amending tho Constitution, and of thus
anetiouirg the eitiuctiuu of African slavery
js n of tiie ifgitiiniite Jesuits of our in
veruecine struggle.
'-Havitig jrqj;rt)-d thus far, the Execu
tive Department found that it had accom
plished nearly all that wa-s within the scope
f constitutional authority. One thing,
'however, yet remained to be done before
sb work of ireHioratiou could be completed,
and that was the admission to Congress of
loyal Senators and Jicpre's from the States

Id ths meantime, tho Executive Depart- ;
cient no other plan having !.?-n proposed
ly Cotigjws continued its efi'oirs to peitoct
sfarasctkble, he restoration of
the properTeiufior between tho citizens of
the respective States, the States, and the
Federal Government, esti nding, from time
lo time, as the pl.1c interests seemed to
require, tho judiciitl, rewmuc, and postal
systems of tho country, W it h ttie advice
and consent of tint Senate, tho necessary
officers were appointed, and appropriations
toado by Congress for the payment ol their
salaries. The proposition Meud the
Federal 0nstattia, to pwflit the
ristenea f via very wiihiu the United
States ta place subject to their jurisdic
tion, was ratified by the requi.-ile number
f States; and on the ISth d.y of Decem
ber, 1S65, it was officially declared to have
become valid as a pait of the Constitution
of the United States. All of the States in
which tho insurrection hud e-isted prompt
ly amended their Constitution.-, so as to
inako them conform to the gieat change
tbus effected in the organic law of the kind;
declared null and void all ordances and laws
of secession; repudiated all pretended debts
and obligations created for the revolution
ary purposes of the insurrection; and pro
ceeded, in goo i faith, to the enactment ot
measures for the protection and , ameliora
tion of the condition of the oi loreJ race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to udinii
any of iheso States to representation; and
it was not until towards the close of the
eighth month of the scsmoii that an excep
tion was made in favor ol Tennessee, by
the admission of her Senators and Uepro
Bcotatives, . ' ,
I deem it a subnet of profound regret
that Congress has thus far la'led to admit
to scats loyal Senators and representatives
from the othor Ststes, whose inhabi'ants,
with those of Tennessee, had engaged in
the robellion. , Ten States more than one
fourth of .the whole number remain with
out representation; the scats of fifty mem
bers in the Heusc of representatives and of
twenty members in the Senate ore yet va
cantnot by their own consent, not bfr a
failure of election, but by thoi refusal of
Congross to accept their credentials. Their
admission it is believed, would have accom
plished much toward the renewal and
strengthening ot our relations as ono peo-
t
)lo, ana reiuovca serious causa mr aiscon-
n t on the part ot ton inhabitants ot those
States. It would have acco ded with the
great principle enunciated in tho Declara
tion of American Independence, that no
people ought to boar the burden of taxation
and yet be denied tho right of representa
tion. It would havo been in consonance
with the express provisions of the Consti
tution, that "each Stats shall have at least
cno representative," and "that no State,
without its consent, shall be deprived of its
equal suffrage in the Senate." Those pro
visions were intended to secure to every
State, and to the people of every State, the
right of representation in each House, of
Congress; ana so important was it deemed
by too ftamers of the Constitution, that the
equality of the States in the Senate should
bo preserved, that not even by - an amend
ment of the Constitution can any State,
without its consent, be denied a voice in
. that branch of the Nationnl Legislature.
It is true: it has been assumed that tho
existence of the States was terminated by
the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and
tbat the insurrection having been suppress
ml. thev were thenou-forward to be consid
ered meiely as conquered territories. , Thu

tion so incompatible with the nature of our
republican system, and with the professed
objects of the war. Throughout the recent
legislation nf Congress, the undeniable fact
tiiakes itself apparent, that these ten nnliti
cal communities are nothing less than States
of this Union. At the vtry commencement
of the rebellion, each House declared, with
a unanimity as remarkable as it was signifi
cant, that the war was not "waged uron
our pan, in any spirit ot oppression, nor
for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,
nor purpose of overthrowing or iiiterlcring
with the rights or established institution til
tl Osc Stales, but to defend and maintain
the supiemaey of the Constitution and all
laws made in pursuance thereof, and to
prose re the Union with a'l the dignity,
equality, and rights of tho several unim
paired; and that as soon as thes objects"
were accomplished the waronghtto cease."
fn sonic instances, Senators lVere permitted
to continue their legislative funcilons, while
in other instances Representative.? were
elected and admitted to jeats after their
States had formally declared their right to
wlthd aw from the Un'on and were endeav
oring to maintain that right bv force of
arms. All of the Slates who.-e people were
in insurrection, as states, were included m
the apportionment of the direct tax of twen
ty millions of dollars annually laid upon the
United States by the act approval 6th Aug
ust. 1H61. Congress, by the act of March
4, l-Sti'i, ami by the apportionment of repro
sentation thereunder, also recognized their
presence as States in the Union; and they
have, for judicial purposes, been divided
into districts, as States alone can be divid
ei The same recognition appears in the
recent legislation in reference to Tennesscr,
which evidently rests upon the fact that the
functions of the State wero not destroyed
hy the rebellion, but merely yuspended; and
that principle is of course applicable tothesr
States which, like Tenriessee attempted to
renounce their places in the Union.
The action of the Executive Department
nf the Government upon this subject has
been equally definite and uniform, and the
purpose ot the war Was Specifically stated in
the Proclamation bevd by mv predecessor
on the 22d day ot September, 1S62. It
was thru solemnly proclaimed ami declared
that '"hereafter, as heretofore, the war will
bo prosecuted for tho object of practically
restoring the constitutional relation between
the United States and each.' of 'ho Slates
and the poop'e. thereof, in which States that
relation is or may be suspended t disturb
ed." - '
The recognition as the States by the Ju
dicial Department of the Government has
also been :!cnr and conclusive in all proceed
ings affecting, them as States, had in the
Supreme, Circuit, and Distri-.t Courts.
In the admission of Senators and I?cp
tcscntatives from any and all of ihe States,
there can bo no just giound of apprehension
that peirons who are disloyal will bo clothed
with the powers cf legislation; for this
could not happen when the J'oiMitutioii
and the laws are enforced by a vigilant and
faithful Congress. Each House is made
the "judge of tho elections, returns, and
qualifications of its own members," and
may. "with the concurrence of two-thirds,
expel a member."' Yhen a Senator or
Representative presents his certificate of
election, he may at once be admilttd or re
jected; cr, should there be any question as
to bis eligibility, his credentials may be re
ferred frr investigation to the appropriate
commuter, it audmitltrd to a scat, it
must be upon evidence satisfactory to the
House of which he tbus becomes a member
that he pessesses the requi-itecnnstitulioniil
and legal qualifications. If refused admis
sion as a m mber for want of due allegiiuicp
to the government, and returned to his
constituents, they are admonished' tniit
none but psrsons loyal to the United States
will be allowed a voice in tho Legislative
Councils of the Nation, and the political
power and moral influence, of Congress are
tbus effet-livdy-exerted in the interests of
loyalty lo the Government and fidelity to
the Union. Upon this question, so vitally
affecting the restoration of the Union and
the permanency of our present form of gov
eminent, my convictions, heretofore ex
pressed, have undergone no change; but. r n
the cor.trniy, their coricvtness Iibs been
ccnfiimed by reflection and time. If the
admission of loyal member to seats in the
respective Houses of Congress was wise and
expedient a year ago, it is no less wise and
expedient now. If ibis anomalous condi
tion is right now, if. in the txuet condi
tion of these States at the present time, it
is lawful to excludo them trom 'reprcf eola
tion, I do not seo lhat the question will be
changed by tho efflux of time. Tenyeais
hence, if these States remain as they are,
the right of representation will be no
stronger tho rilit of exclusion will be no
weaker.
The Constitution of the Uni'ed States
makes it the duty of the. President to rc
coimikiid to the consideration of Congress
'"such measures m he shall judge necessary
or expedient," I know of no measure more
itnpaith civ demanded by every cnmidi-ra-tion
of national interest, sound policy and
equal justice, than the admission of loyal
members hoiii the' now unrepresented
States. This would consummate the work
of restoration, and exert a most salutArv
influence in the -restablishment of peace.
harmony, and fraternal feeling. It would
tend greatly to renew the confidence of the
American people in tho vigor and stability
of their institutions. It would bind ns more
closely as a nation, and enable us to show
to the world the inherent and recupciutive
power of a Government founded upon the
will of the people, and established upon the
principles of liberty, justice, and intelligence.
Our increa'cd strength and enhanced pins
pcrity would irref'rangably demonstrate the
fallacy of the arguments against free insti
tutions drawn . from finr recent national
disorders by the enemies of republican cov
er; 111 en t. The admissioo of loyal members
from the States now xcludod from Con
gress, by allaying doubt and apprehension,
would turn capital, now awaiting an op
portunity for investment, into tho chattels
of trade and industry. It would alleviate
the present troubled condition of thn:e
States, and. bv inducing emieration. aid in
the fentimcnt of fertile re l ions now uncul
tivated, und lead to an increased production
of those staples which have added so greatly
to the wealth of the nation and the cum
merce of tho world. New fields of enter
prise would be open to our progressive
people, and soon the devastations of war
would be repaired, and all traces of our
domestic difference effuccd from the minds
of our contitrynien.
In our efforts to preservo the unity of
urvernment wntcn constitutes us one poo
pie," by restoring the Slates to the condi
tion which they held prior to the rebellion,
we should be cautious, lest, having rescued
our nation from perils of threatened disin
tegration, wo resort to consolidation, and
in the end absdute despotism, as a remedy
for the recurrence of similar troubles. The
war having terminated, and with it nil nr..
ension for tho exercise of powers of doubt
ful constitutionality, wo should hr.sten to
br'o? legislation withiu the boundaries pre
CADIZ, OHIO,
scribed by the Constitution, and to return
to the ancient landmarks e tablished by our
f'Mbers for the guidance, of succeeding gen
erations. "The Constitution which at any
time exists, until changed by an explicit
and authentic hftt of tSe whole people, is
sacredly obligatory upon all." "If, in the
opinion of the people, the distribution or
modification of tho constitutional powers
be, in any particular, wrong, let. it be cor
rected by an amendment in the way ill
which the Constitution designates. But
let there be no change by usurpation: for"
"it is the customary weapon by which free
Governments are destroyed." Washington
spoke these words to bis countrymen, when
followed by their love ane gratitude be vol
untarily retired from tho cares of public
l fc. "To keep in all things within the pale
of our constitutional powers, ahd cherish
the Federal Union as the only rock ot safe
ty, were prescribed by JelFrison as rules
of action to endear to his "countrymen the
true principles of their Constitution, and
remote n union of sentiment ahd action
equally auspicious to their happ:ncss unci
safety." Jackson held that the action of
the General Government should si ways I c
stiie-tly confined to the sphere of its appro
priate duties, and justly and forcibly urged
that our Government is not to bo maintain
ed nor our Union preserved "by invasions
of the lights and powers of the. several
States. In thus attempting to make our
G'et eral Government stiong, we mnkj it
weak. Its true strength consists in leaving
individuals and States is much as possible
to themselves; in making itself felt, not in
its power, but in its benelict rice; not in its
control, but in its protection; not in binding
the States more closely to the center, but
leaving r-aclv'tn move unobstructed in its
proper constitutional orbit." These hie
the teachings of men wheisc deeds and ser
vices have made them illustrous, ami who.
long since withdiawn from the scenes of life,
have lef to their country the rich legacy of
tboir rmnmplc, their wisdom, and their patriotism-
Drawing fresh inspiration from
their lessons, let us emulate them in love of
country and rejp-.ct from tho Constitution
ami the laws.
The report of the Secretary of the Treas

ftVctiui) and commerce of the country. His
views upon the currency, and with reference
to a pivper adjustment of our levcnue sys

The decrease of revenue compared with

The growing importance of the foreign

The report of the Secretary of the
Interior exhibits tho condition of those
brain bes of the public service which
tiro committed to bis supervision.
During the lust fiscal year, 4,(i2!,312
ai res of public hind were dispose! of,
l,8S)2.oli acres of which were entered
under the homestead act. The policy
originally adopted rclntitc to tho pub
lic hinds has undergone essential modi
fications. Immediate revenue, and not
their rapid settlement, was the cardinal
fenfttrc of our land system. Long ex
perience and earnest discussion have
resulted in the conviction Hint the early
development of our agricultural re
sources, and the diffusion of an ener
getic population over our tast territo
ry, are objects ot lnr greater importance
to the national growth and prosperity
than the proceeds of tho sale of the
land to the highest bidder in open mar
ket. The pre-emption lutvs confer up
on the pioneer who complies with the
terms they impose, the privilege of
purchasing a limited portion of "111101
fcrcel lands" at the minimum price.-
Tho homestead enact men's relieve the
settler from the payment of purchase
money, unei secure linn a permanent
homo, upon the condition of residence
for a term of years. This liberal policy
invites emigration from the old, and
from the more: crowded portions of
the new world Its propitious results
are undoubted ahd will be more sisr-
niilly manifested when time shall have
girpiii to it a wider development.
l.ongrcss tins made liberal grants Of
public laud to corporations in aid of the
construction of railroads and other in
ternal improvements. Should this pol
icy hereafter prevail, moro stringent
provisions will be required to secure a
faithful application of ihe fund. The
title to the lnnds should not pass, by
patent or otherwise, but remain in the
Government and subject to its control
Until some portion of the road has been
actually built. Portions of them might

As 11 subject upon which depends an
immense amount of the production mid
commerce of the country. I recommend
to Congress such legislation us may be
necessary for the preservation of' the
levees ot the Mississippi rivers. It is
a matter of national importance that
early steps should be taken not only to
add to the efficiency of these pairiers
against dcstiuetive inundations, but
for the removal of. all obstruction's to
the free und safe navigation of that

The District of Columbia, under ex
isting laws, is not er.Iitled to that rep
resentation in the Nuttoiial Councils
which, from our earliest history, has
been uniformly accorded to each Terri
tory established from time to ti:r e with
in our limits. It maintains peculiar
relations to Congress, to whom
the Constitution has granted the power
ot exercising exclusive legislation over
the seatjitjovynnient. Our fellow
citizens resnlfng in th"c District, whose
intciests arc thus confided to the spe
cial guardianship of Congress, exceed
in number Ihe population of several of
our Territories, and no just reason is
perceived why a delegate of their
choice should not be admitted to a seat
in the House of Penresentati ves. No
mode seems so appropriate und effect
ual of enabling them to make known
their peculiar condition and wants, ami
of securing the local legislation adopt
ed lo them. I therefore, recommend
Ihe passage of tt law nittlioriHng the
electors of the District of Columbia to
choose a delegate', to be allowed the
same rights and prlvllegrs ns.i delegate
representing a Territory. The increas
ing enterprise and -vapid progress of
improvement in the District are high
ly gratifying, and I trust that the efioiis
of the municipal authorities to pro
mote the prosperity of the national
metropolis will receive the efficient and
generous co-operation of Congress.

It is 11 subject of coiigratulaiioii that

patriotism have increased at home, a
more just consideration of our national

Telegraph between the const of Ireland

that equal success will attend, and ever,

France and the President of the United
oiuii-s 101-me wi'.iuir.'iwni trom .Mexico i
of the ireiich expeditionarv miiitarv
forces,
This withdrawal was to be ef-
feeted in three detachments, the first of
which, it was understood, would leavs
Mexico in November, now past, and thu
second in March next, and the third
and last in November. lNJ7. Immedi
ately upon the completion of thu evac
uation, the French tiovertiineiit was to
assume the same attitude of non-intervention,
iu regard to Mexico, as is held
by the Government of the United
Slates. Popeated nssu.-ances have been
given to the Emperor, since that agree
ment, that he would complete the prom
ised evacuation withiu the period men
tioned, or sooner.
It was vuitsomibiy expected that the
proceedings thus contemplated would
produce 11 crisis of great political in
terest in the. Pepnblie'of Mexico. The
newly appointed Minister of the Uni
ted Slates, Mr. Campbell, was therctore
sent forward, on the 0th day of Novem
ber last, to assume bis proper functions
as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Uni
ted States to that Pepublie. if, was nU
m thought expedient that lie should be
attended iu the vicinity of Mexico bv
the Lieutenant General of the Army of
the United States, with the view of'ob
taiiiing such information as might be
important to determine the course to !
be pursued by the United States in re
establishing and maintaining necessary j
and proper intercourse with thePepub-1
lie of Mexico. Deeply interested in
the cause of liberty and hunmtiiiy, it
seemed 1111 obvious duty on our part to
exercise whatever influence we posses
sed for thu restoration and permanent
establishment in tbilt country of a do
mestic and republican form of govern
ment. Such was the condition Of afialrs iu
regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of
November last, official information was
received from Paris that the Kinperor
of France had some time before decided'
not, to withdraw a detachment of his
forces iu the month of November pastj
according to engagement, but that, this
decision was made with thu purpose of
withdrawing the whole of those forces
in the ensuing spring. Of this deter
mination, however, the United States
had .iot received any notice or intima
tion ; and, so soein as the information
was received by the Government, care
was taken to make known its dissent to
the Kinperor of France.
I cannot forego the hope that France
will reconsider the subject, and adopt
seme resolution iu regard lothe evacu
ation of Mexico which will conform as
nearly as practicable with the existing
engagement, mid thus meet the just
expectations of the United States. The
papers relating to the subject will be
laid before you. It is believed that
with the evacuation of Mexico by the
expeditionary forcet, no subject for se
rious differences between France and
the L luted states would remain. The
expressions of the Enipcror and people
of 1- ranee Warrant a hope that the tra-
ditionury friendship between the two
countries might 111 that case be renewed
and permanently restored.
. A claim 0tac1i17.cn oi the L mfeil
btatcs for indemnity for spoliations
committed on the liyli seas by the
French authorities, in ihe exercise of a
belligerent power against Mexico, has
been met by the Government of France
with a proposition to defer settlement
until a mutual convention for the ad
justment of all claims of citizens and
subjects of countries', arising out of re
cent wars on this Continent, shall be
tlgreed Upon by the two con 11 trios. The
suggestion is not deemed Unreasonable,
but it belongs to Congress to direct the
mniiuer in which claims for indeinnitv
by foreigners, as well as by citizens o'f
tho I oiled States, ' arising (mt of the
late civil war, shall be adjudicated mid
determined. 1 have no doubt that the
subject of all such claims will engaue
your attention u't 11 convenient and
proper time.
It is a matter of regret, that no con
siderable advance bus been made to
wards an adjustment of the differences
between the United States and Great
Britain, arising out of the depredations
upon our national commerce and other
trespasses committed during our civil
war by British s-ubjeetsi iu violation of
international law nnd treaty .obliga
tions.. The delay, bowever, maybe be
lieved lo have resulted in no small de
gree from the domestic situation of
Great Britain. An entire change of
ministry occurred ill that country dur
ing the last session of Parliament.
The attention of the new ministry was
called to the subject at an early day.
and there is some reason to expect that
it wil1 now be considered in a becom
ing and friendly spin'.- The impor
tance of an early di -position of the
que.-.tion cannot bo exaggerated. What
ever might ba tho wishes of the two
Governments, it is manifest that good
will uml Ineneiship oefween ihe two
countries cannot be established until a
reciprocity, In Ihe practice rf good
faith and neutrality, shall be restored
between the respective nations.
Un the btli of dune last, 111 violation
of our neutrality laws, a miiitarv ex
pedition and enterprise against the
British North American Colonics was
projected and attempted to be eai ried
on within I lie territory and jurisdiction
of the United States." In obedience to
the obligation imposed upon the Ex
ecutive by the Constitution, to see
that the laws are fiphfu ly executed,
all citizens were warned, by proclama'
tiou, against taking part id or aiding
such iinlawfal proceedings, mid the
proper civil, military liud naval of
ficers weie directed to tike alt neeOs
sary liieasvres for the enforcement of
the laws. The expedition failed, bul
it, has no' been without its painful con
sequences. Some of our citizens who, j
it was alleged, were engaged in the ex- 1
pedition, wore captured, and have becu
groughl to trial, as lor a e:;pital oii'enciy

iu the maxim of government,- that sev

tuotisly tailed, is uusouiiu and unwise,
such representations have been made
to the British Government, in behalf

en-raged in it were chiefly natives Of

ment have deemed it necessary to sus
pend the w rit of Iwbc.ris corpus iu that
country. " These cirenlnstaitees must '.
necessarilly modify the opinion which ,
we might otherwise have entertained
in regard to nn expedition expressly,
prohibited by our netrality laws; So ;
long as those laws reinaiin iipe;ii 0111
statute-book's, they should be faithfully
executed, and if thev -operate' harshly'
unjustly, or oppressively, CongftJss :
alone can supply the remedy, by their
modification or repeal.
Political and commercial interests of
the United States are not unlikely to
be af'.'ecied in some degree by event
which are transpiring in the' eastern
regions of Europe, and the time seems
to have come when our Government
ought to hale a proper diplomatic re
pf' -sentation iu G recce.
This Government lias claimed for all
persons not convicted, or accused, or
suspected of crime, an absolute politi
cal right of sell' expatriation, anrl a
choice of new national allegimn-e. Most
of the European Stales have dissented
from this principle, and have claimed a
right to hold such of I heir subjects as
have immigrated to and been natural
ized in the I'nited State,- and after
wards returned on transient visits tt
their native countries, to the perform
ance of military service in like m umer;
as resident subjects, (.'oinpluinti aris
ing from the claim in this respect mndii
by foreign Slates, have heretofore been
mutters of controversy between the .
United States and fome of tho Euro
pean Powers, end Ihe irriratiou conse
quent upon fiie failure to settle this
question increased during the War in ,
hieh Prussia, Italy, and Austria were
recently engaged. 'While Great Prit-
fnii' iur TirVor iii-l.-nOivloili-'eil ttiu ,'l.rlif

bus not been accepted by the United
Slates. Peace is now prevailing everv-
Wbcre in Europe, and the present Stuons
to be a favorable lime for an assertion
by Congress of the principle, so long
maintained by the Executive Depart
ment, that naturalization by one Stato
fully exempts the unlivc-b'orn subject
of any other Slate from the performance
of military service under any foreign
Government, so long as he does not
voluntarily renounce its rights and
benf flts.
In the performance of a duty imposed
ubon me bv the Constitution, I have
thus submited to the Representatives
of the Slates and of the People such in
fortriatiofi of our domestic and foreign
affairs as the public interest seem ten
require, 'Our Government is now un
