Washington, Dec. I. —Following is
the president's message read at the
opening of congress today :
The Senate and House of Representatives:
The reports oi the several ricuuiiu
departments which will be laid before
congress in the usual course will exhibit
in detail the operations of the govern
ment for the last fiscal year. Only the
more important incidents and results,
and chiefly such as may be the founda
tion of the recommendations I shall sub
mit, will be referred to in this annual
message.
The vast and increasing business of
the government has been transacted by
the several departments during the year
with faithfulness, energy and success.
The revenues, amounting to about $450,
--000,000, have been collected and dis
bursed without revealing, so far as I
can ascertain, a single case of defalca
tion or embezzlement. An earnest effoit
has been made to stimulate a sense of
responsibility and public duty in all the
officers and employees of every grade,
md the work done by them has almost
wholly escaped unfavorable criticism. I
speak on these matters with freedom,
because the credit of this good work is
not mine, but is shared by the heads of
the seyeral departments with the great
body of faithful officers and employees
who serve under them. The closest
scrutiny of congress is invited to all the
methods of administration, ardto every
item of expenditure.
Friendly Foreign Kela ions.
The friendly relations of Dur country
with the nations of Europe and of the
East have been undisturbed, while the
ties of good will and common interest
that bind us to the states of the western
hemisphere have been notably strength
ened by the conference held in this cap
ital to consider measures for the general
welfare. Pursuant to the invitation
authorized by congress, the represent
atives of every independent state of the
American continent and of Hayti, met
in conference in this capital in October,
1889, and continued in session until tha
19th of April. This important convoca
tion makes a most interesting and con
tinental epoch in the history of the
western hemisphere. It is noteworthy
that Brazil, invited under an imperial
form of government, shared as a repub
lic in the deliberations and results of
the conference. The recommendations
of this conference were all transmitted
to congress at the last session. The
International Maritime congress which
sat in Washington last winter reached a
very gratifying result. The recommend
ations suggested by it have been brought
to the attention of all the governments
represented, and their general adoption
is confidently expected.
The legislation of congress at the last
session is in conformity with the propo
sition of the conference, and the procla
mation provided therein will be issued
when the other powers have given notice
of adhesion.
The Congo State.
The conference at Brussels to devise
means for suppressing the slave trade in
Africa afforded an opportunity for a new
expression of the interest the American
people feel in that work. It soon be
came evident that the measure proposed
would tax the resources of the Congo
basin beyond the revenues available
under the general act of Berlin in 1884.
The United States, not being a party to
that act, could not share in its revision,
but by a separate act the independent
state of the Congo was freed from the
restrictions upon its customs revenue.
Tho demoralizing and destructive traffic
in ardent spirits among the tribes also
claimed the earnest attention of the
conference, and the delegates of the
United States were foremost in advocat
ing measures for its repression. An ac
cord was reached, the influence of which
will be very helpful and extend over a
wide region. As soon as these meas
ures shall receive the sanc
tion of the Netherlands, for
a time withheld, the general acts
will be submitted for ratification by the
senate. Meanwhile negotiations "have
been opened for a new and complete
treaty of friendship, commerce and nav
igation between the United States and
the independent state of Congo.
The Recognition of Brazil.
Toward the end of the past year the
only independent imperial government
on the western continent, that of Brazil,
ceased to exist, and was succeeded by a
republic. Diplomatic relations were at
once established with the new govern
ment, but it was not completely recog
nized until an opportunity had been af
forded to ascertain tnat it had popular
approval and support. When the course
of events had yielded the assurance of
this fact, no time was lost in extend
ing to tho new government a full
and cordial welcome into the family of
American commonwealths. It is con
fidently believed that the good relations
of the two nations will be preserved,
and that the future will witness an in
creased intimacy of intercourse and an
expansion of their mutual commerce.
The Central American Unpleasantness.
The peace of Central America has
again been disturbed through a revolu
tionary change in Salvador, which was
not recognized by the other states, and
hostilities broke out between Salvador
and Guatemala, threatening to involve
all Central America in conflict, and
undo the progress which has been made
toward a union of their interests. The
efforts of this government were promptly
and zealously exerted to compose their
difference, and through the active ef
forts of the representative of the United
States a provisional treaty of peace was
signed August 20th, whereby the right
of the republic of Salvador to choose its
own rulers was recognized. General
Ezeta, the chief of the provisional gov
ernment, has since been confirmed in
the presidency by the assembly, and
diplomatic recognition duly followed.
The Barrundia Atl'alr.
The killing of General Barrundia on
board the Pacific mail steamer Aca
pulco, while anchored in transit in the
port of San Jose de Guatemala, de
manded careful inquiry. Having failed
in a revolutionary attempt to invade
Guatemala from Mexican territory,
General Barrundia took passage at. Aca
pulco for Panama. The consent of the
representatives of the United States
was sought to effect his seizure, Srst st
Cbamperic, where the steamer touched,
and afterward at San Jose. The cap
tain of the steamer refused to give up
his passenger without a written order
from the United States minister.
The latter forwarded the desired
letter, stipulating as the condition
of his action, that General Barrundia's
life should be spared, and that he should
be tried for offences growing out of his
insurrection movements. This letter
was produced to the captain of the
Acapulco by the military commander at
Han Jose, as his warrant to take the
passenger from the steamer. Barrundia
resisted capture, and was killed. It
being evident that the minister, Mr.
Mizner, had exceeded the bounds of his
authurity in intervening in compliance
with the demands of the Guatemalan
authorities, to grant authority to effect
(in violation of precedent) the seizure on
a vessel of the United States of a pas
senger in transit, charged with political
offenses, in order that he might be tried
for such offenses under what was de
scribed as martial law, this government
was constrained to disavow Mr. Mizner's
act, and recall him from his post.
The Nicaragua Canal.
The Nicaragua canal project, under
the control of our citizens, is making
most encouraging progress, all the pre
liminary conditions and initial opera
tions having been accomplished within
the prescribed time.
During the past year negotiations
have been received for the settlement of
the claims of American citizens against
the government of Chili, principally
growing out of the late war with Peru.
The reports from our minister at
Santiago warrant the expectation of an
early and satisfactory adjustment.
Our Relations with China.
Our relations with China, which have
for several years occupied so important
a place in our diplomatic history, have
called for careful consideration, and
have been the subject of much corre
spondence. The communications of the
Chinese minister have brought into
view the whole subject of our conven
tional relations with his country; and at
the same time this government, through
its legation at Pekin, sought to arrange
various matters and complaints touch
ing the interests and protection of our
citizens ill China. In pursuance of the
concurrent resolution of October 1, 1800,
I have proposed to the governments of
Mexico and Great Britain to consider a
conventional regulation of the passage
of Chinese laborers across our southern
and northern frontiers.
On the 22d day of August last Sir Ed
mund Munson, the arbitrator, selected
under the provisions of the treaty of De
cember (I, 1888, rendered an award to the
effect that no compensation was due
from the Danish government to the
United States, on account of what is
commonly known as the Cailos Butter
field claim.
Our relations with the French continue
cordial. Our representative at that
court has very diligently urged the re
moval of the restrictions imposed upon
our meat product, and it is believed that
progress has been made toward a just
settlement.
Samoan Affairs.
The Samoan treaty last year at Ber
lin, by representatives of the United
States, Germany and Great Britain,
after due ratification and exchange, has
begun to produce salutary effects. The
formation of the government agreed up
on will soon replace the disorder of the
past by a stable administration, alike
just to the natives and equally to the
three powers most concerned in trade
and intercourse with the Samoan
islands. The chief justice has been
chosen by the king of Sweden and Nor
way on the invitation of the three pow
ers, and will be installed. The
land i commission and the muni
cipal council are in process of
organization. A rational and evenly
distributed scheme of taxation, both
municipal and upon imports, is in op
eration. Malietoa is respected as king.
The new treaty of extradition with
Great Britain, after due ratification, was
proclaimed on the 25th of last March.
Its beneficent working is already appar
ent.
The Bering Sea Question.
The difference between the two gov
ernments touching the fur seal question
in the Bering sea is not yet adjusted, as
will be seen by the correspondence
which will soon be laid before congress.
The offer to submit the question to arbi
tration, as proposed by her maj
esty's government, has not been
accepted, for the reason that the
form of submission proposed
is not thought to be calculated to assure
a conclusion satisfactory to either party.
It is sincerely hoped that before the
opening of another season some arrange
ment will be effected which will assure
to the United States a property right,
derived from business, which was not
disregarded by anynation for more than
eighty years preceding the outbreak of
the existing trouble.
A Wrong Done Hawaii.
In the tariff act a wrong was done to
the kingdom of Hawaii, which I am
bound to presume was wholly uninten
tional. Duties were levied on certain
commodities which are included in the
reciprocity treaty now existing between
the United States and the kingdom of
Hawaii, without indicating the neces
sary exception in favor of that kingdom.
TUESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 2, 1890.
I hope congress will repair what might
otherwise seem to be a breach of faith
on the part of this government.
Hayti an Claims.
An award in favor of the United States
in the matter of the claim of Mrs. Van
Bokkelen, against Hayti, was rendered
on the 4th of December, 1888, but owing
to the disorders then and afterwards
prevailing in Hayti, tho terms of pay
ment were not observed. A new agree
ment as to the time of payment has
been approved and is now in force.
Other juet claims of citizens of the
United States for redress of wrongs suf- •
fered during the late political conflict in
Hayti, will, it is hoped, speedily yield to
friendly treatment.
Propositions for the amendment of the
treaty of extradition between the !
United States and Italy are now under
consideration.
Proposed International Conferences.
You will be asked to provide the |
means of accepting the invitation of the
Italian government to take part in an j
approaching conference to consider the
adoption of an universal prime meridian
from which to reckon longitude and
time. As this proposal follows in the j
track oi the reform sought lo be initiated ,
by the meridian conference at Washing- ,
ton, held on the invitation of this gov- j
eminent, the United States should man- >
iffcst a friendly interest in the Italian
proposal. In this connection, I may re
far with approval to the suggestion of
my predecessors, that standing pro
visions be made for accepting, when
ever deemed the fre
quent invitations of foreign governments
to share in a conference, looking to the
advancement of international reforms in
regard to science, sanitation, commer- i
cial laws and procedure and other mat
ters affecting the intercourse and pro
gress of modern communities.
The Delagoa Bay Affair.
In the summer of 1889 an accident oc
curred, which for some time threatened
to interrupt the cordiality of our rela- j
tions with the government of Portugal.
That government seized the Delagoaßay
railway, which was constructed under a
concession granted to an American citi
zen, and at the same time annulled j
the charter. The concessionary, who had j
embarked his fortune in the enterprise,
having exhausted other means of re- j
dress, was compelled to invoke the pro- j
tection of his government. Our repre- '
sentations, made coincidentally with j
those of Great Britain, whose subjects ]
were also largely interested, happily
resulted in the recogniti n by Portugal 1
of the propriety of submitting the claim j
for indemnity, growing out of its action,
to arbitration. This plan of settlement
having been agreed on, the interested 1
powers readily concurred in the , pro
posal to submit the case to the judgment
of three eminent jurists to be designat ed
by the president of the Swiss republic,
who, upon the joint invitation of the
governments of the United States, Great.
Britain and Portugal, has selected per
sons well qualified for the task before
them.
The Treaty With Japan.
The revision of our treaty relations
with the empire of Japan has continued
to be a subject of consideration and of
correspondence. The questions in
volved are both grave and deli
cate, and while it will be
my duty to see that the interests of the
United States are not by any changes
exposed to undue discrimination, I sin
cerely hope that such revision as will
satisfy the legitimate expectations of
the Japanese government and maintain
the present and long-existing friendly
relations between Japan and the United
States, will be effected.
Friendship with Mexico.
The friendship between our country
and Mexico, born or close neighboring,
and strengthened by many considera
tions of intimate intercourse and recip
rocal interests, has never been more
congenious than now, nor more hopeful
for increased benefit to both nations.
The intercourse of the two countries by
rail is already great, and is making con
stant growth. The established lines and
those recently projected, add to the inti
macy of traffic, and open new channels
of access to fresh areas of demand and
supply. The importance of the
Mexican railway system will be further
enhanced to a degree almost impossible
to forecast, if it should become a link in
the projected intercontinental railway.
I recommend that our mission to the
City of Mexico be raised to the first
class.
Cordial Relations with Spain.
The cordial character of our relations
with Spain warrants the hope by the
continuance of methods of friendly ne
gotiations, that much may be accom
plished in the direction of an adjust
ment of the pending questions and in
crease of our trade. The extent and de
velopment of our trade with
the islands of Cuba invest
the commercial relations of the
United States and Spain with a peculiar
importance. It is not doubted that a
special arrangement in regard to com
merce, based upon the reciprocity pro
vision of the recent tariff act, would
operate most beneficially for both gov
ernments. This subject is now receiving
attention.
Ericsson's Remains.
The restoration of the remains of John
Ericsson to Sweden afforded a gratifying
occasion to honor the memory of the
great inventor to whose genius our
country owes so much, and to bear wit
ness to the unbroken friendship which
has existed between the land which bore
him and our own, which claimed him as
a citizen.
Venezuelan Claims.;
On the 2d of September last, the com
mission appointed to revise the pro
ceedings under the claims convention
between the United States and Vene
zuela, of 18t>6, brought its labors to a
close within the period fixed for that
purpose. The proceedings of the late
commission were characterized by a
spirit of impartiality and a high sense
of justice, and the incident, which was
for many years the Bubject of discussion
between the two governments, has been
disposed of in a manner alike honorable
and satisfactory to both parties. For
the settlement of the claim of the Vene
zuelan Steam Transportation company,
which was the subject of a joint resolu
tion, adopted at the last session of con
gress, negotiations are still in progress,
and their early conclusion is anticipated.
The Consular Service.
The legislation of the past few years
hag evidenced oa the part of congress a
growing realization of the importance of
the consular service in fostering the do
mestic revenues. As the scope of its op
erations expand, increased provision
must be made to keep up the essential
standard of efficiency. The necessity of
some adequate measure of supervision
and inspection has been so often pre
sented that I need only commend the
subject to your attention.
The Nation's Finances.
The revenues of the government from
all sources for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1890, were $463,903,080.55, and
the total expenditure for the same
period were $358,618,584.52. The postal
receipts have not heretofore been in
cluded in the statement of these aggre
gates, and for the purpose of compari
son, the sum of $60,882,097.92 should
be deducted from both sides of the ac
count. The surplus for the year, includ
ing Jie amount applied to" the sinking
fund, was $105,344,496.03. The receipts
for 1890 were $16,030,923.79, and the ex
penditures, $157,398.71, in excess of
! those of 1889. The customs receipts
from internal revenue were $11,725,
--; 191.89, whileon the sideof expenditures,
j that lor pensions was $19,312,075.96, in
j excess of the preceding ye#r.
: The treasury Miu.i.eijjcut for the eur
j rent fiscal year, partly actual and partly
j estimated, is as follows: Receipts from
j all sources, $406,000,000; total expend!
--| tures, $354,000,000 ; leaving a surplus of
; $52,000,000, not taking the postal re
j eelpt.s into account on either side.
The loss of revenue from customs for
j the last quarter was $25,000,000, but
I from this must be deducted a gain of
about $16,000,000 realized during the
] first four months of the year.
For the year 1890 the local estimated
receipts are $373,000,000, and the esti-
I mated expenditures $387,952,209.42,
j leaving an estimated surplus of $15,147,
--1 790.58, which with a cash balance of
$52,000,000 at the beginning of the year,
will give $07,147,790.58 as the sum avail
able for the redemption of outstanding
bonds or other uses.
The estimates of receipts and expendi
tures for the postoffice department, being
equal, are not included in this statement
jon either side. i
Silver Left-illation.
The act directing the purchasing of
silver bullion and tbe issue of treasury
notes thereon, approved July 14, 18SX),
has been administered by the secretary
of the treasury, with an earnest purpose
to get into circulation at the earliest pos
sible dates the full monthly amount of
treasury notes contemplated by its
provisions, and at the same time
to give to the market for silver
bullion such support as the law
contemplates. The recent depreciation
in the price of silver hae been observed
with regret. The rapid rise in price
which was anticipated, and which fol
lowed the passage of the act, was influ
enced in some degree by speculation,
and the reaction is part of the result of
the same cause, and part of the recent
i monetary disturbances.
Lome months of further trial will be
necessary to determine the permanent
effect of the recent legislation on silver
values, but it is gratifying to know that
the increased circulation secured by the
act has exerted and will continue to ex
ert a most beneficial influence upon bus
iness and upon general values.
While it has been thought best to re
new formally the suggestion of an inter
national conference looking to an agree
ment touching the full use of silver for
coinage, at a uniform ratio, care
has been taken to observe closely any
change in the situation abroad, and no
favorable opportunity will be lost to
promote a result which it is confidently
believed would confer very large benefits
on the very large commerce of the world.
The recent monetary disturbances in
England are not unlikely to suggest a
re-examination of the opinions upon
this subject. Our very large sup
ply of gold will, if not lost
by impulsive legislation in the sup
posed interest of silver, give us a posi
tion of advantage in promoting a per
manent and safe international agree
ment for the free use of silver as a coin
metal.
Increased Volume of Money.
The efforts of the secretary to
increase the volume of money
in circulation by keeping down
the treasury surplus to the lowest
practicable limit, have been unremit
ting aud in a very high degree success
ful. The tables presented by him, show
ing the increase of money in circulation
during tho last three decades, and
especially the table showing the in
crease during the nineteen months he
has administered the affairs of the de
partment, are interesting and instruc
tive. The increase of money in circula
tion during the nineteen months has
been in the aggregate $03,886,814, or
about $1.50 per capita, and of this in
crease only $7,100,000 was due to the
recent silver legislation. That this sub
stantial and needed aid given to com
merce has resulted in an enormous re
duction of the public debt and of the
annual interest charge, is a matter of
increased satisfaction.
There have been purchased and re
deemed since March 4, 1889, 4 and 4M
per cent bonds to the amount of $211,
--832,450, at a cost of $246,620,741, result
ing in the reduction of the annual in
terest charge of $8,967,609, and a total
saving of interest of $551,606.
Internal Revenue,
I notice with great pleasure the state
ment of the secretary that the receipts
from internal revenue have increased
during the last fiscal year nearly $127,
--000,000, and that the cost of collecting
this large revenue was less by $90,617
than for the same purpose in the pre
ceding year.
The percentage of the cost of collect
ing the customs revenue was less for the
last fiscal year than ever before.
Customs Administration.
The customs administration board
provided by the act of June 10, 1890,
was selected with great care and is com
posed in part oi men whose previous ex
perience in the administration of the
old customs regulations, had made them
familiar with the evils to be remedied,
and in part of men whose legal and
judicial acquirements and experience
seemed to fit them for the work
of interpreting and applying the
new statute. The chief aim "of the law
is to secure honest valuations of all duti
able merchandise, and to make these
valuations uniform at all our ports of
entry. It has been made manifest by
congressional investigation that a sys
tem of under valuation had been long in
use by certain classes of importers, re
suiting not only in a great loss in reve
nue, but in a most intolerable discrimi
nation against honesty. It is not seen
how this legislation, when it is under
stood, can be regarded by the citizens of
any country having commercial deal
ings with us, as unfriendly, and if a
duty is supposed to be excessive, let
complaint be lodged and it will surely
be remedied. It will not be claimed by
any well disposed people that a remedy
may be sought and allowed in a system
of quasi-smuggling.
Army Improvements.
The report of the secretary of war ex
hibits several gratifying results attained
during the year by wise and unostenta
tious methods. The per centage of de
sertions from the array (an evil for which
both congress and the department have
long been seeking a remedy) has been
reduced during the past year 24 per cent.,
and for the months of August and Sep
tember, during which time the favorable
effects of the act of June 16th were felt,
4 per cent., as compared with the same
period of 1889. The results attained by
a reorganization and consolidation of
the division having charge of the liob
pital service and records of volunteer
soldiers, are very remarkable. This
change was effected in July, 1889. and at
that time there were 40,064 cases await
ing attention, more than half of these
being calls from Ihe pension office for
information necessary to the adjudica
tion of pension clainaß. On the 30th
day of June last, though over three
hundred thousand new calls had come
in, there was not a single case that had
not been examined and entered.
I concur in the recommendations of
the secretary that adequate and regular
appropriations be continued for coast
defense works. Ordnance plans have
been practically agreed upon, and there
can be no good reason for delaying the
execution of them. While the* defense
lessness of our seaports furnishes an
urgent reason for wise expedition., the
encouragement that has been extended
to the militia of the states, generally ap
propriately designated the national
guard, should be continued and en
larged. These military organizations
constitute in a sense the army of the
United States, while about live-sixths
of the annual cost of their maintenance
is defrayed by the states.
Department of Justice.
The report of the attorney-general is
under the law submitted to congress, hut
as the department of justice is one of
the executive departments, some refer
ence to the work done is appropriate. A
vigorous effort has been made to bring to
trial and punishment all violators of the
law, but at the same time care has been
taken that frivolous and technical of
fenses should not be used to swell the
coffers of the officers or harass well-dis
posed citizens.
Especial attention is called to the
prosecution of violations of the election
laws, and of offenses against United
States officers. The number of convic
tions secured, very many of them upon
OVERCOATS
IN FULL SWING.
~J"N SPITE of the fact that the weather continues warm,
our sales on Overcoats are away ahead of last year.
One reason is, that our stock this season seemed to be ex
actly what was wanted. Very few persons have entered
our establishment in quest of an Overcoat without making
a purchase. Right and popular prices of course had some
thing to do with it. If you have not yet made your pur
chase, take our advice and buy now while the assortment
is yet complete. We have a fine line of Cape Overcoats;
also Boj's' and Children's.

pleas of guilty, will, it is hoped, have a
salutary restraining influence.
There have been several cases where
postmasters appointed by me have been
subjected to violent interference in the
discharge of their official duties, and to
persecutions and personal violence of
the most extreme character. Some of
these cases have been dealt with through
the department of justice, and in some
cases the postoffices have been suspend
ed or abolished. I have directed the
postmaster general to pursue this course
in all cases where other efforts failed to
secure for any postmaster, not himself
in fault, an opportunity to peacefully
exercise the duties of his office, but such
action will not supplant the efforts of
the department of justice to bring the
particular offenders to punishment.
Fraudulent Naturalization.
The vacation, by judicial decrees, of
fraudulent certificates of naturalization,
upon bills in equity by the attorney
general in the circuit court of the United
States, is a new application of a familiar
equity of jurisdiction. Nearly one hun
dred such cases have been taken during
the year, the evidence disclosing that a
very large number of fraudulent certifi
cates of naturalization have been issued;
and in this connection I beg to renew
my recommendation that the laws be so
amended as to require a more full and
searching inquiry to all the facts neces
sary to naturalization, before any certifi
cates are granted. It certainly irtiot too
much to require that an application
for American citizenship shall be heard
with as much care and recorded with as
much formality as are given cases in
volving the pettiest property rights.
At the last session I returned without
my approval a bill entitled: "An act to
prohibit book making and pool-Belling
m the District of Columbia," and stated
my objection to be that it did not pro
hibit, but in fact licensed what it pur
ported to prohibit. Efforts will be made
under the existing laws to suppress this
evil, though it is not sure that they will
be found adequate..
The Postal Service.
The report of the Postmaster-General
shows the most gratifying progress in'
the work committed to his direction.
The business methods have been greatly
improved; a large economy in ex
penditures, and an increase of
four and three - quarter millions
in receipts have been realized. The de
ficiency for the year is $5,783,300 aa
against $6,350,183 last year, notwith
standing the great enlargement of the
service. Mail routes have been ex
tended and quickened, and greater accu
racy and dispatch in distribution and
delivery have been gained. The report
will be found full of interesting sug
gestions, not only to congress, but to
those thoughtful citizens who may be
interested to know what business
method can be found in that depart
ment of public administration which
most nearly touches all our people.
The passage of the act to amend cer
