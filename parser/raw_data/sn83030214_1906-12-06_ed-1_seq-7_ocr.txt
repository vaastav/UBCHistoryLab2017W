DESTITUTE ARTISTS MAKE APPEAL
Sir Superannuated Painters and Sculptors
Apply for Needed Help.
Six destitute sculptors and painters, aped and in
firm, well known In their profasatoes, it was learned
yesterday, have this week applied for help to the
Artists" Aid Society.
One of these artists, who has a reputation both
'" a «*ulptor and a painter, is more than seventy
years of age and has recently become paralyzed.
Another sculptor is seventy years old. and his
aged wife Is heroically making a pathetic. and hope
less attempt to earn enough to keep them both
nlive. The other artists, through illness or similar
misfortune, are unabl« to continue th« practice
of their profession.
These new and unex>»ci».l appeals for help,
most reluctantly made by these victims of cir
cumstances, may, it '■* hoped, excite sympathetic
Interest in the movement started by the Artists'
Aid Society and the Artists" Fund Society to raise
J.V.000 to plae* superannuated artists and their
wives in homes already established.
As told in The Tribune, when it -a. is learned that
more than a dozen w«-rj known artists In this cit7
we utterly destitute William Y. Havemeyer,
chairman of the board of trustees appointed by
the two artlsiB 1 benevolent societies, contributed
»l.°oo and Samuel P. A very ?6'>> toward th« pro
posed j-../.., fund.

THE PRESS AND MESSAGE.
Spirit of the Comment of Support
en and Opponents.
TRUSTS.
FTom The New York Times.
Tli<» ■»M«»st «*oimsel the President Rive* to COS
gress is contained in that passage of bis message
wherein he recommends the amendment of the.
Anti-Trust law of IWi to "obviate the evil' of pro
hibiting all combinations of capital, whether good
or harj. The President h»a b?<~ome convinced that
"the effort to prohibit all combination, pood ov bad,
is obnoxious where li Is not Ineffective." Combina
tion of capital, like <-omh!rmtior. of labor, he r<»
rrards as a necessary element of our Industrial sys
tem; it cannot be prevented, and, If possible. Its
prevention would do damage to the body pollti?.
THE RIGHT OF APPEAL.
From The New York ftur>.
With the recommendation that the Government
should b*» allowed a right of appeal on questions of
law in criminal cases we heartily concur. Of roi'rpe.
If the defendant in a criminal prosecution lihs been
acquitted by a jury It is impossible to est.iW!«h any
fivstem of reviewing the judgment which will en
title the government to place the accused upon trial
b eecond time. To do this would be to put him
twice ln Jeopardy, In violation of Article V of the
amendments to the Constitution of the United
States. There is every reason, however, why the
government should have the right of appeal in
'■riminal cases in order to secure a review of the
rulings of the court adverse to the prosecution upon
pure questions of law wherever this can be done
without Interfering with n verdict Of acquittal.
• j
PEOPLE WILL CONCUR.
Frcm The Philadelphia Record.
The mass of the people of the United States, how
ever, will i^ad the long m^Fsntie with practical con
currence in th» greater part of Its recommenda
tions. md in the greater part of the pr Ing with
which Mr. Roosevelt Interlards his stale papers.
Becauai of the lack of bristling partisanship he
lias not offended one-half the people while nursing
Th» prejudices o* the other half. The tone is too
Imperialistic; but that will he overlooked as the
outflow of a self-confidence riot Inconsistent with
;ui undiminlshed popular faltli ln the Presidential
F"od intent.

AS ACTING EMPRESS.
Archduchess Appointed to That Dig
nity in Austria.
Archduke Francis Ferdinand's ever growing influ
ence In aeain appar«nt In the appointment of his
half sister. Archduchess Maria Annunctata, to the
dignity of flrst lady of the land In Austria and
Hungary, and as grand mistress of the various
feminine orders or knighthood In the dual empire.
It Is a dignity which may he described as that of
acting Empress, and she receives as such all the
presentations ..• women at court, natives as well
as foreigners.
Th» status was enjoyed by the wife of the Arch
duke Otto until his death recently. Strictly speak
ing, it should have, gone thereupon to Archduchess
Alice, who Is also Qrand Doebwa of Tuscany and
consort of the last sovereign of Tuscany, who lost
his throne when his dominions v.ere absorbed by
the Kingdom of Italy «n l^" Emperor Frauds
Joseph, after consulting with the agnates, that la
to mv, the adult mate members of the Hot ■-• of
Hapsburg, and ■nlth his ministers, deckled thnt
neither the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, who i» by
b rth a Bourbon of Parm.i, nor yet the wife of h*r
•eeond son. Archduke Joseph) who la a princess >»f
the Neapolitan branch of i\v Bourbons, could
possibly I* oalesated to take the part of acting
Empress without causing all kin«ls of compllca
tions and awkward rontretempa ("onflequenl on
th? recommendation of thr- h^ir ni>r'arc::t. hii favor
ite half-sister, to -v- did he la devoted, and who waa
preset at his morganatic marriage, waa appointed
to the dignity, which she will retain, not only until
the death of her uncle, Francis Joseph, but nlso
throughout the reign of her half-brother, Francis
Ferdinand, ov.lnp; to the morganatic chnra< tei of his
marriage.
Of course, tha archduchess would have to sur
render this honor in case of her marriage, a3 the
etiquette and laws of the court of Vienna demand
that the wife should always assume the rank and
precedence of her husband when the marriage has
been a right-handed instead of .i left-hand&a union.
Thus, the Empeior's younger dauebter, Arch
duchess Valeri* !<>st t!;<^ i>rei-edoni-« which had
been hera i>y birth when she married Archduke
Francis Balvator, of the Tuscany branch of tlie
Hapsburgs, and now- shares I Is place low down In
tho table «>f precedence, while Arcliduchesp Kllza
betfa, the grandchild of the emperor, and the only
offspring: <>* the late Crown Prince Rudolph, for
felted her states and j>r«M-<?dpnce as an Imperial
archduchess v.hen Khi> became the wife of Prince
Otto Windlsi igraal • although the lattr-r. as a-Aon
of a m°diatized anil formerly sovereicn l-.ouse. Is
entitled to mate with princesses nf the rrljfning
house» on a footing of equality.
ONI.T WOMKN WITH EPIBCOPAL PRr2ROOA
TIVES.
Archduchess Maria Annunelata the new actlnj:
ESmpreaa, although unmarried. Ins enjoyed the
rank and status of a married woman ever since
■he bcame abbess of the so-called Convent of the
Noblfi. T.adles of the Bradarhtn, at Pra'cue. The
place of abbess of this order la Invariably held by
one of the unmarried archduchesses, and was filled
by Archduchess Christina until her marriage with
the late King of Sr«ln. Although only bound to
celibacy as long as she remains abbess, the arch
duchess, b? such, possesses nlor.e .".rrtoiig ,'i!l wom?n
in holy orders the right of exercising certain
rji'scorinl prerogative?, among them that of crown
liijt the Queen of Bohemia, when the r'rirr.ate of
noherr.l.i crowns the Emperor as King of Bohemia,
with the crown of St. Wenceslaa. On F*atc occa
sions, and at church nnd court ceremonials, she
appear?" with a species of mitre shaped Jewelled
ho.-ddrcss. carries in her hand a jewelled crosier,
similar to those borne by bishops and archbishops
of the Roman Catholic Church, and wears with a
peculiarly fashione.l black silk dress a lon* black
mantl°. v.ith pweepln? train.
The convent of which she is abbess was founded
many centuries ag-o by the old Ings and queens of
Bohemia^ but was reorganized and endowed anew
by Empress Maria Theresa to s»rv« as a species of
institute for Impoverished women of illustrious
birth. All kinds of genealogical qualifications are
required for admission. But once a woman belongs
thereto she has no further care for anything, betng
provided not only with a most comfortable resi
dence in the royal palace of Hradachin and food
from the royal kitchens, but also with servants,
carriages and oven an allowance of money for
minor expenses. The only thine :< c l:> of her in
return Is that she should attend mass in the morn
ing and vespers In the afternoon, offering up at
these services certain prayers for the reisninp: fam
ily. They are all either widow? or unmarried v •iii
rn, and in case of their marriage ai compelled to
resign their membership in the order. While they
b^lonu to it they are entitled "<-aniir;e=s" or "cha
nolnne«?e," ai d have tho stattis of married wom
en, qualified, therefore, even if single, to act as
chaperons.
The Archduchess Maria Annum la 'a now thirty
yearK .'!. Is a stately, handrome woman, who has
Inherit* much of the comeliness and. many of th«
talents of her mother, formerly tii<-> most beautiful
anil still th*> mest gifted and brilliant princess of
the reigning house- a sculptress, a painter, a poet
and an equestrienne whose feats of horsemanship
rivnll^d those of her Eister-in-law, th« late Empress,
Totii' the TCnip^ror and his nephew. t!i» heir a;'
rmrert, as well as some of the other aimatec,
wished that the princess should ri'suin- the dignity
of act ins empress, which she held after the assas
sination of Empress Klizab«"t!i until the death of
her own husband, Archduke Charle-s l^iuis, but ah
wo'.iM r.ot liear of it, :ir..l it was in consequence
thereof that :h° office was bestowed upon lit r
daughter.
HER JILTED FIANCE NOW INSANE
Maria Annunclata Is extremely religious. In
deed, after the somewhat s«n«atlrnal bre«kins: off
of l.er engagement to D ike Siegfried of fjavarla oi\
the eve of ths dat<s appointed for th< marriage,
she was bent for a time upon takhig llie vows of a
full-fledged nun and withdrawing forever from the
world. This desire was further strengthened wßen
subsequently her former, fiance lost hia reason,
which he has never recovered, for aha regarded
herself ns in n. measure responsible for his Insanity,
which she believes to have been caused by li«r pre
clpltate actlc>a In jilting him when the profligacies
and riN'-ir.ations r.f his previoua life were suddenly
revealed to her by some officious relative or frienjl.
She had been deeply In love with him, and under
the circumstances it Is tiot astonishing tliat her
demeanor ever since should liavo lieeu character
ized J>y a certain melancholy, The Emperor would
not permit her to take the vows of a uun, pointing
«ii!t to her that It would he contrary to the inter
ests of the dynasty, and that she could accomplish
just as much good work, and even more, ;<s abbess
of the Convent c-f the Noble lies of th« Ilrad
schln.
Recently she was able to convince herself of the
truth of her uncle's worts, for had shA been a
nun of the strict order which she had been anx
ious to join s*ie would not have been able to nurse
her unfortunate half-brother. Archduke otto,
through his last dreadful Illness, or to have helped
her mother to soothe both his sufferings and his
dying moments •■ the absence of his wife, who
had declined to remain at his bedside or to have
anything more, to do with him. \je* me add that
Archduchess Matin Annunclata is ntreroely fond
of her half-brother'a morganatic wife, the Princess
Hohenberg, is the prodmother of the latter*i chil
dren, and in her new dignity of acting empress
may be depended iip° r - *° do evrything in her
power to Improve the position at court of the won
derftilly al.le pr'.r.cess.

"FEDORA" DONE TO MUSIC.
A novelty in the second week of the season, with
another promised for two days later. Is a considera
ble achievement on th« part of Director Conrled.
who uttered an official document last season to
explain why novelties were all but impossible un
der existing conditions at the Metropolitan Opera
House. Rut circumstances alter esses, of course,
and some noveltien are more easily produced than
others. An opera without a chorus, without a
' bali*t. with no s"-er.ir eff^t"" that require

its expiring rays on "Andrea Chiehler." It was
thought then by this reviewer that the you::g
man had something to say to the world which
would at least merit very serious attention, but |
there have been disclosures since which diminish"-.! j
his needling stature. PucdnJ'a name dawned on
an lat»r. and h-an continued to emit considerable

an operatlfi version of •'Artrienne Lecouvreur." Tii^
juxtaposition of "Fednrn.'.' and •*Adrk.nne" Intli
ctt»p a reversion to an^early manner of Verdi In th=
choice of subjects, though there has been a worM
of change since "[.a Dame dux <*a!n«>ii!as" became
M lia Travlata*' and Schiller's "Ka'.>ala nnd IJebe"
was transmogrified Into "Lulsa Miller." In one
respect the ißtter day tend»nelt*s of the verltlsts
Is commendable. It Is better that they should at
tempt the Impossible with plays of Sardou and
Scribe than to continue to wallow in the filth of
the barnyard and shafnbles. Kven the most blood
thirsty lover of the new Italian muse was bound
to (;iow weary of the musk si style which only a
decade ago was threatening to Infect Germany as
well as France.
It is hardly necessary to say that operatic mii?i-
Is no longer what it was when Verdi redeemed his
consumptive wanton with hi 3 melodies. Then It
never attempted to meddle with the action, but
confined Itself to characterizing the people of the
play and celebrating the moods and passions con
tured up at Intervals by it. Now. as wo wore com
pelled to observe last night, the play no longer
exists for the music, but th» music for the play.
. Sensuous beauty is no longer sought: the tones
have become only a condiment, a hot spice, which
occasionally give raised expression to a shriek, but
lor the rest retard the action and disturb attention
which might more profitably be employed else
v here. Puccini possesses the power of characteriza
tion, ana can color with his melody as well as his
harmony anil orchestral pigment. Nothing approach
ing his skill could be found In Giordano's- "Fedora."
A more sluggish and Intolerable flrst act than the
legal leanest can scarcely be imagined. Frag
ments of inconsequential tunes float along In a
turgid stream, while above it the people of th*
play chatter and scream, and become Intelligible
and interesting only when they lapse Into ordinary
speech. Ordinary speech Is the only speech that
an expeditious drama can tolerate, and It is not
raised to a higher power by the blowing of
brass or the beat;::? of drums. The frankest
confession of the futility of Giordano's effort to
make a lyric drama- out of "Fedora" Is con
tained 1 In the fact that only those moments In
his score are musical in she accepted sense when
the play stop", as ln the ease of the Intermezzo,
which cuts the second act In two, or when the oM
operatic principles waka again into life, as in Lorisfa
confession «>f love. Here, in th* first Instance, a
mood r^eehes musical delineation] and in the sec
ond ■ jiaMsion which is naturally lyrical receives
utterance. One device new to the op^nitic stage
In its external^, at least. Is Ingeniously employed by
the composer. The conversation In which Feiora
extorts a confession from I^>ris i* carried on while
a |>lanist entertains the princess's guosts wtth a
sola upon liis instrument. But the fact that stnaj-
Ing tones are useil and no! spoken ad'is nothing to
the value of the scene.
This opera, like Puccini's "To?ca," which Is In
finitely Bner, would be Intolerable without (rood
acting, and It has been the good fortune of both to
?::;.! operatic artists who are something mure than
mere singers. Mm.- Cavalier! !h only a sin) ln
the third instance, so to speak. In the first she is
a marvellously beautiful woman, with a ."kill fn
dress and v gracefulness atnl eloquence of carriage
and pose which have an irresistible charm In them-
selves; in the second, she is an actress of admirable
parts. As a singer !i*r province can only ;
be found in works like this of Giordano In which
none of the elements of good Rinsing— not even the !
elementary one:; of correct intonation and agree- i
able voice quality— ner>j ent«T. Her vocalization is
not worth discussion: her voice is void of charm; j
her (Terence to the text amazing. Yet she had ;
her triumph, which was second only to that of i
Caruso's, a. triumph won by Ida glorious voice, with j
its sensuous beauty wedded to the accents of pas- j
.slim. Other artists took part in the performance
and acquitted themselves well, even these o; in- ;
ferior lank. Th« ability t<> do that is one of the j
advantages which this style of lyric drama offers i
to tUose of little >r!fts. There n^ed re no particular- j
ization. A record of the c;t.-i will sti3lcc at least j
for to-day:

POIXT FOR G. B. SHAW.
Writer Secures Interlocutory Judg
ment Against Publishers.
George Bernard Shaw yesterday secured, through
Sackett. Chapman A Stevens, Interlocutory judg
ments in the Supreme Court against Herbert B.
Stone & Co.. and Fox. DujSeld. & Co. These Judg
ments were entered In an equity suit brought by
Mr. Shaw to require th* reassignment to him ©f
certain copyright*, an accounting for certain un
paid royalties arj ths payment of damages for the
alleged wrongful retention of the copyright!.
Tha complaint sets forth Mr. Shaw's authorship
of certain books: that his first license to publish
his works was given to Grant Richards, In London,
who subsequently, with Shaw's consent, transferred
h!s rights to Herbert P. Stonw * Co.. of Chicago.
The latter took out American copyrights as trustee
for Shaw. It la further alleged that stone failed
to account to the plaintiff tor royalties on large
quantities of Ids works sold by them, and that
many thousands o* dollars are due him from Stone
arising out of f=uch publications. It was also
claimed that aftr r a!' th- defendants had notice of,
the claim« of tlie plaintiff. Stone transferred, to
Fox. l).ittiftlci «t Co. their publishing business, in
cluding the plates and unbound volumes of plain
tiff's works
Th.) dofendiints demurred to th* complaint, plead
ing: that, admitting the truth of plaintiffs allesa
tior.s. h* had not made out a cans* of action and
that causes of action were Improperly united. Judge
O'Gorntan's decision overruled the demurrers, hold
ing that all the defendants were properly Joined and
that "the facts alleged present a case for equitable
relief." Th» judgments entered provide for final
jiiiisrm»nt unless the defendants pay the coats and
servo tbeir answers within twenty (Java.
