"? jury in Seattlo has decided that
a dog has a right to bito a man in self
defense, relates the Portland (Ore.)
Telegram. Thia is an interesting vcr
diot. It appears that a dog bit a
piece out of a man's leg, and the vic
tim sued tho owner of tho dog for
$10,000. Th defense was that tho
dog would never havo bitten tho mas
if ho had not been provoked to do ?
and that as ho was provoked to dc u
the dog was standing quito within his
rights in biting the man. Tho defense
was upheld, and dog and owner alike
ought to bo happy. Many other cases
of a similar nat'ire have been brought
before, but this case is said to he the
first time that the ju -y has taken this
point of view.
The Columbia Record of the 8tb
last., says: "If tho now judicial bill
passes Congress John ?G. Capers will
not have smooth sailing in becoming
Judge. Senator Tillman is opposed to
bim, and insianates that the quioker
j begets out of the way the better it
will be for the bill. Mr. Capers de*
clares that he will not stand in tho
way, which is commendably UDselfish
in him. With him out; of the way B.
. fi*. Cochran, of Anderson, a life long
."Republican, would loom up promi
nently. At the same time, at pres
/ ?nt, it seems to be a plum whioh lome
I Democrat may finally knock down."

?elf to his own party ranks to select

Next Year's Cotton Crop.
Atlanta, Ga.,. December iO.--Presi
dent Harvie Jordan, of the Southern
Cotton Association, issued u circular
lotter to tho farmers of tho South to
day regarding a reduction in cotton
acreage for IOCS. Tho lotter says in
part:
"The Southern Cotton Association
will not ask the farmers of tho South
to reduce the cotton acreage for 1000
less than that planted in 1005. The
Association doeB ask, and insist with
all the force at its command, however,
that the acreage planted In cotton
throughout the bolt in 1005 be not in
creased during the planting season of
1000. Let the , watchword of every
Southern farmer be diversification,
and through that agenoy produce nn
abundance of food supplies to main
tain each farm.
"The present estimated twenty
seven million acres planted in cotton
is sufficient under normal climate con
ditions to produce enough cotton to
meet the demands of the spinners for
the American, staple. Auy material
increase in the cotton acreage of 1000
will tend to stagnate the cotton mar
ket and depress prices below their
legitimate value. The legitimate law
ofsopply and demand 1B the only true
medium ot regulating fair and legiti
mate prices for our great staple pro
President Jordan- cl o BOB the letter
with a strong appeal to the farmers to
plant an abundance ot small grain,
corn and side crepe, and urges them
to raise more hay, cattle and hops
that the farms may become more self
BUBtaining.
