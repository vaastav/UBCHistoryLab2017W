of thin denial Havmc recently held the

defeat of his political ambition which (ten

Wt'pn the House took up. last week, tbe
hill incorporating the Nicaragua canal
company, which passed tbe Senate at the
last session of C ongress, it was objected to
in a way which showed that the promoters
of the De Leaneps scheme are opposed to al
lowing abv other company to get a hold on
the Isthmus, and further conaiderauon of
the bill was put over to a future day With
the authority given hv our Vermont legis
lature, however, tbe Nicaragua company
has a substantial legal basis to work upon.
All accounts agree that the De l.eneps
company is on tbe eve of a crisis in it af
fairs, and nothing hut the direct interfer
ence of tbe French government, by shoul
daring the immense financial responsibility
involved, can aave tbe scheme from a dis
astron wreck. And such a movement. I
even would aimply postpone the day of
doom
The Mpnngfiel,! Republican savt tn an ed
i tonal paragraph that although it is now
nearh two vears since tbe disaster on the
Cpntral Vermont railroad near White Riv
er Junction, in which MO persons were kill
ed and All injured, only about half tbe cane
for damages have been settled, and no suit
have yet oome to trial One test case,
which has lieen pending in the courts at
Boston for some tune, has arain lieen pntt
noncd until February ."i. exactly two years
from the date of the disaster Most of the
cases tbat have been adjusted were dis
poned of on verv easy terms by the road,
according to all accounts. Tbe Republican
adds tbat Massachusetts lawn do not allow
of each laxitv The statutes fix the price
of a life, and the railroad cannot ecape in
a case like tbat of the White River disas
ter. Tbe Butsey bridge accident, where 2H
were killed and 100 injured, will cost the

We are in receipt of a copy of the sixth
biennial report of the Kansas Mate Insane
Anvlum at Topeka. from lb-. Wentworth.
who was formerly connected with the Asv
Inm at Brattleboro We are especially
truck witb tbe fact of the increasing nnm
ber of the insane everywhere demanding
public provision, in tbe new states as well
as in the old It apiiears from this report
that Kansas has now two large asylums af
fording capacity for about 120(1 patients,
and though neither of tbeee are yet fully
oomtiieted. a plea in made for tbe establish
ment of a third public institution in that
state The statement is made tbat the ra
tno of the insane in Kansas to the popula
tion is very much below tbat of the eoun
try at large. This ratio, an oomjiared to that
of our own state, is hut about one-half as
large.
inia in eeruniniv aoggenive mai ne late
action of our legialature ban lieen none too
hasty and tbat the eatablinhment of a state
any lulu in Vermont u an urgent neceaaitv
Tnat necessity certainly exists whenever it
becomes nnoessnrv to frame laws for the
exoianiou of any class from existing insti
tutions, and this ban lieen the case here for
ten years pant The growing civihnatioii
of our country and of tbe world demon
strates the necessity for the creation of in
antnthms for the special care of the various
rlnisen of dependents, and tbe beat results
are not seen whan insane poor persona, are,
on the ecore of economy, obliged to be
thrown into almnhouaos having no special
provisions for their npecial needs. Thm
policy, ui fact, h a retrograde one : and we
are giad to see that our state has so reao
tetalv asserted its conviction of the nece.
nfty that is upon it

in to the credit of the KeHtliean ps)ertof
tbe country that tbey made not the nlifht
eat use of these scandals, by even so much
an an almnon to tbem. and that it was left
to the President's professedly ntroneest
supporters to aive them tangible form and
put them in everylmdy's mouth And
even tbe Time admits that It a "disap
pointed Democratic politicians" who "in
vented" or first circulated them
The New York Sun charged the Times
with a deliberate intention to stab Mr
Cleveland under the fifth rib in printing
tbe letter referred to. and vie are stronply
inclined to think tbe Sun in neht about it
Ciean-rainded people, even those who
have the leant liking for the President
litioally, refuse to believe that his private
life, with a youn? and iieautiful wife, is
other than it should !e, and it arouses both
indignation and disgust that a campaign,
which the victorious party tried to make
clean and decent, should lie given such an
after -ending
Mrlf-'.umrirlil tVlsaam.
Mi . Kdtlur On rec. 4th a friend askod
me if 1 had read the President's message
I told him no. but 1 could tell him the sub
stance of it just as well as if 1 had it lie
lore nip that Orover Cleveland would
tall tbe people of the United States, through
Congress, that they had mode asses of them
selves in falling to reelect him to tbe presi
dency, and that consequently the country
wan going to the dogs Of course the form
he would put it in could not lie told tiefore
hand. but that was what he hon:tly thought
and would express in hi ow n way
And no it has turned out Orover Cleve
land is an honest man : he thoroughly be
lieves that any one v ho disagrees with him
in a fool or a knave, and he has said so. in
auhntance. in his message!. Honenty is a
very desirable quality in a President, as it
is in all officials . but there are other desir
able qualities m a President and lu all other
officials. Beside bonetty. the people would
hke to have in their President some knov.1
edge of political economy, some knowledge
of the condition of the country, some knowl-
edge of its wants and capacities, its present
state and future prospects . some acquain
tance with w hat it need now and what it
ought to have hereafter President-elect
Harrison has all these qualifications. Pre
dent Cleveland none, but a bull-dog hon
esty Many of our party friend w ill den
him that, but I believe tbat he i justly en
titled to tbe character of a man who hrmlv i
jand conncientiouslv believes that w itdom is
I incarnated in him. and will disappear tram
I the earth at his decease s
Ufanl l ..re Will lie.
The Washington correspondent of the
New York Mail and Express, after a care
ful review of tbe outlook for any tariff leg
islation being accomplished at this session
of Congress concludes that there i no
prolinlnlitv of anv tariff reduction being
carried throuch The Republican senators
have gone proniptU to work and will make
a strong effort to pass their bill, and they
mav lie able to get it through the fwnate.
But this is by no mean, certain There are
t some Republican who are opjiosed to tbe
reduction of the sugar rates, and to tbe in
crease in the rates on cottons and woolens
Whatever is done in tbe Senate, however,
the verdict rests w itb the Houe. and if tbe
bill should go to that liody it w ill not get out
in the form tn which it pased the Senate,
simply becaue there are not enourh protec
tion 1 e.mocrfit in the popular branch of
Congress to give the Republicans a majority
The dispute tietween tbe two parties on
the tariff question is irreconcilable Tbe
t Democratic party is not only opposed to the
present law . but Mr Carlisle and his follow -ers
say that the Senate bill is w orse than
the present law They will not vote for
any measure that may oome to them from
! tbe Seuate. and the sooner tbe business
! community accepts the fact that taxes are
I not to be reduced by tbe Fiftieth Congress,
I the sooner tbev will he able to adjust tbeir
1 affairs for another year's struggle with the
I exintiug condition of affairs. The Demo
crats have determined to make their view s
I on tbe tariff tbe isue of another campaign,
i and no help can be exjiected of them m re
j ductng the surplus by means of any meas
1 ura that is based on the theory that Amen
mn mdutrie. need ail the protection that
