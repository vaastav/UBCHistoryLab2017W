PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Fellow Citlttm of tU Scnali and Houts of Rip
TtttMUlVCMl . ' 11. IU,
Since yoor last annual eescmbltuff another
year of health aDd boubtlful barvetle bae paes
ed. And wbilolt bufliiot pleased tbe Almighty
to blees us with a remm of peace, we oiq bat
prcfi 00, gilded by the beat light He givr-c nt,

wav, ull will yet be well. : ; . .,
Tbe corrnp3odecoo toucbiug farelgo affilrs
wblcb big token place daring the list year la
herewith submitted, In tirtnal compliance with
a request to that tttiot, made by tbe House of
RepreacnUtirea near tbo close of the Ut gei
eloa of Coogrws.
if tbe ooDditioa or our relatlona with other

been at former periods, it is oertaioly more
SAiiairtctoxy toaa a nation gj unhappily tilatraol
ed aa we are, might reasonably have appre
bended. I j the month of Jane last there were
eone grounds to expect that the maritime pow
ers which, at the beginning oi oar domesiio
dlffloaltlee, so unwloWy esd uuneceesurily, as
we tblfik, rccogcizs J tbo Jninrgenta aa a belllp;

alve, tbaii to oar owu country. But the tem
porary reveiaea wbiou atlerward befell tbe na
tional urine, and which were exaggerated by
our own disloyal citizens abroad, bare hitherto
delayed that act oi simple justice.
The civil war, which bag aa radically ohang
ed, lot tho moment, the occupations and habits
of tho Amcrlota people, baa Dcoenaarlly dis
turbed tie sooial oonditlon. and affected vert
deeply the protpetliy of tbe nations with which
we nave carried on a commerce tuat bai been
steadily Increasing throughout a period of half
a century. It hp, at tbe same lime, exolted
political ambitiona and apprebeuslona wblob
bave produced a profound agitation throughout
tbe civilized world. Ia this unusual agitation we
bave forborne Tom tikiDg part ia any contro
versy oetweea loreign etatra, and between par
ties or factions In suori etates. We bave at
tempted no propagandists, and ackuowlodged
do revolution. But we havo left to every na
tion tbe exolngive oonduot and manarement of
ita own effilrs. Oar etraggle bas beeu, of
course, contempluted by foreign iiattoba wlih
telorenoe less to ita own merits, than tp ita
supposed, and often exaggerated tdoU und
cooecaaenoca resulting to those nations them
selves. Nevertbeiess, complaint ou the pirt of
mu government, even II It were ust, would
oertainly be unwise.
The treaty with Great Britain far the sup
pression of the slave trade has been put into op
eration with a good prospect of complete encoeea.
It la an occasion of epeclal pleasure to acknowl
edge that tha execution of It, on the part of her
Majesty's government, haa been marked with a
jealous respeot for tbe authority of the United
states, ana tne light, of their moral and loyal
oititens.
Tbe convention with Hanover for tbe aboli
tion or the btado data bag been earned Into lull
effect, under f be act of Congress for that par
pose. '
A blockade of three thousand miles of ae
02at could not be established, and vigorously
enforced, in a season. of great commercial ac
tivity like the present, without committing oc
casional mistakes, and led ctlng unintentional
lojuriea upon foreign nations anl their aobjeots.
A civil war occurring in a country wbero
foreigners reitfe and carry on trade under
treaty stipulations, Is ntceaurilr fruitful of
complalnta ol the violation ot neutral rights,
All eucb collisions tend to cxoltc misappre ben
sjone, and possibly to produce amtual reclama
tions Dutween cations which nave a common
interest in preserving peace and Wentftblp. ' Io
clear casus of these kiada I bave, so far aa pos
sible, beard and redressed complalnta which
have been presented by friendly powers. There

Thia proposition bai been made especially to
Great Britain, to France, to Spain, and to Prus

influenced by pbilanthropio aentimenta bave
suggested similar measures; while on tbe other
hand, several of tho Spanish A morican Repub

colonies to their respective territories. Under

Tho suspesaion of specie payments by the

A return tospeele payment!, however, at tbe
e&rlieal period comDatibla with d.m
all interests concerned, should eer be kept In
view. Fluctuations in the valun nf rn.ronn.
are alwas isjurlous, and to reduce these fluctu
ations to tbe lowest possible nolo! will aiwavs
be a leading purpose In wise legislation. Con
vertibility, prompt and certain convertibility
into coin, is generally acknowlpdcerl ha th.
best and surest safeguard sgalnst them; and it

I know of noco wblcb promises so certain
results, and Is, at tbe same time, so unobjection

guarded In Its provisions. To such associa

tha bduds would compensate tbe United States
fOEltbe preparation and distribution of the
notes, and a general supervision of the system,
and,wou!d lighten the burden of that part of
the public debt employed as securities. The
puouo creoit, moreover, would be greatly im
proved, and the negotiation of new leans
greatly facilitated by the steady market de
mand fcr Government bonds which the adoption
of the proposed system would create.
it la an additional recommendation of tbe
measure, of considerable weight, in my judg
ment, that It would reconcile, as far aa possible,
all existing Interests, by the opportunity offered
to exis log institutions to reorganise under tbe
