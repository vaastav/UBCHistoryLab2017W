Bryan and his followers will doubtless

It should not be forgotten that the Demo
cratic leaders ' in the House, other than
those who voted for the Overstreet bill,
prevented a vote on a IS to 1 substitute for
the gold standard proposition. All of which
shows that with Democrats of intelligence
15 to 1 Is a dead issue.
- The half panics incident to stock gamb
ling in New York and Boston are a source
cf hopefulness to those whose political
fortunes would be promoted by a period of

scarcely be reached by depreciation of the
prices of fictitious stocks.
The proposition that representatives in
Congress shall be apportioned to the States
during the next decade upon the basis of
voters rather than population is attracting
pome attention in Washington. It Is held
fcy. those who advocate the change that it
is warranted by the fourteenth amendment
to the Constitution,, which declares that
when the right to vote is denied by any
State to any of the male inhabitants twenty-one
years of age "the basis of repre
sentation in the House shall be reduced in.
the proportion which the number of such
male citizens shall bear to the whole num

The Mobile Regkter (Dem.) says that
''not many months ago the display of a
TJryan picture to an assembly in a Mobile
theater would surely rouse a storm of
applause, but that time Is no more." Mon
day night, when . Mr. Bryan's picture - was
thrown upon the screen, some applause
followed, with a few shouts In the uprer
part of the house. Directly after a Mc
Kinley picture was shown, and it was
greeted with applause equal to that given
to Bryan, some saying it was twice as
leud a that given to Mr. Bryan. "The
difference in quantity is of no conse
quence." says the Register; "the startling
fact being that a Mobile assembly ap
plauded McKinley at alL"
The passage of the Overstreet currency
lill by the House yesterday by a vote of 190
to IjO was a distinctive triumph for the gold
standard. If the parties had divided strict
ly on party lines the bill would have passed
ty about fifteen votes. Instead of forty,
but eleven Democrats voted for the
Xlll, which Increased the majority by twen-
tytwo votes, and three Democrats were
absent and not paired, which made the
Democratic addition to the majority twenty-five
votes. Two of these Democrats are
not in . Washington, but Representative
.Smith, of Maryland, the Democratic Governor-elect
In that State, deliberately
dodged. Having so promptly met the ex
pectations of a vast majority of the busi
ness and producing element of the coun
try, the House has earned a holiday vaca
tion. The financial troubles In New York yes
terday appear to be largely due to the
large amounts of the stocks of the combi
nations called trusts which are held there.
The trust company which suspended was
loaded with them, and the firm of brokers
which failed was carrying that class of
securities In Wall streef proper such
stocks bave been distrusted because they
represented plants which were largely
overcapitalized and because public senti
ment and possible legislation will be hos
tile to them. From the time these stocks
were put upoa the market the most of
them have declined. Banks in New York
and conservative trust companies have not
favored the sale of these stocks, but the
trust company which suspended yesterday
was largely engaged in speculation In such
stocks. One of the causes of stringency In
the money market has been the locking up
of large amounts of money Incident to the
formation of industrial combinations or
trusts. And yet with the stringency which
was the cause of the half panic in the
Stock Exchange yesterday there was no
decline in sound stocks paying regular.
If small, dividends. The fall was in a class
of speculative stocks which are bought and
sold upon margins. It will be observed that
the stringency In money is confined chiefly
to the large cities to which promoters have
taken their watered trust stocks to sell
and on which they have obtained the
money which is tied up in their efforts to
form trusts. In those cities doing legiti
mate business there Is no further strin
gency than is reflected from the large
cities that have been money centers.
IS IT THE DEMOCRATIC PLAXf
In the House of Representatives a few
days ago Mr. Williams, of Mississippi, pre
sented a resolution which, to use his lan
guage, Is "the result of consultation among
a number of Democratic leaders In the
House." The resolution declares it to be
the purpose of the government to with
draw its land and sea forces from the
Philippines upon the establishment of
peace and the organization of a govern
ment or governments by the people of the
Islands, provided the Filipino government
or governments refund to us the J20.000.000
which was paid to Spain. The Filipinos are
to give us a naval station and coaling sta
tions, free access for our merchandise and
our missionaries; but for a period of ten
years they are to surrender into our keep
ing "the entire question of foreign rela
tions" and to pay the expenses of any
troops we may keep oh Philippine territory
at the request of the island government.
The foregoing, according to Mr. Williams,
is the policy of the Democratic leaders of
the House in relation to the Philippines.
That this is the Democratic declaration of
the House has been doubted outside, but
no Democrat In the House protested, so it
is fair to assume that the resolution re
flects the sentiment of the party in that
branch of Congress. It does not seem that
Mr. Williams and his associates asked Mr.
Eryan if this shall be the Democratic
policy, but the hasty zeal of Mr. Williams
in behalf of government by the consent of
the "governed must be pardoned, since he
lives in a State which has deprived 140,
000 voters of the right to express consent
or dissent regarding their government by
taking from them the right of suffrage.
He evidently desires to make amends for
the outrage in which he participated by
giving to men bearing arms against the
United States the right to do as they
please.
There can be no doubt that if Mr. Wil
liams's friend, Aguinaldo, could be over
taken and presented with a copy of his
Joint resolution, he would accept with
thanks, provided the American Congress
would adopt It. Under such freedom as
the resolution gives Aguinaldo would re
turn to Manila and go about governing
without regard to the consent of anyone
the work of governing, in his vocabulary,
being synonymous with robbing the natives
with dispatch and neatness. Nor would he
stop with the natives: he would turn upon
the foreigners and compel-them to empty
into his strong box the profits of their
commerce, since Mr. Williams's resolution
gives Aguinaldo absolute power without
responsibility. The plundered English and
German merchants would appeal to their
respective governments, and their respec
tive governments would call upon the
United States, having entire charge of the
foreign relations of Agulnaldo's govern
ment, to reimburse their subjects for prop
erty taken by him and his associates. Hav
ing charge of the foreign relations of the
Filipino government we would be obliged
to pay the damages.' We might send our
ships to bombard Manila 'until Aguinaldo
should disgorge, but it would be very ex
pensive and unsatisfactory. It would be
much cheaper to let Aguinaldo rob the for-1
eign merchants at his sweet will and for
us to foot the bills without a word. Aguin
aldo would appreciate that sort of thing.
It is unfortunate for Aguinaldo that this
Democratic resolution cannot reach him.
It Is Just what he has been having his
friends killed for. It gives him all he has
ever asked for and all that he desires the
undisputed right to rob everybody in the
Philippines. In fact, it Is more than he
has asked for, since the United States gov
ernment must protect him against In
trusion while he plunders. This resolu
tion must gladden Edward Atkinson, An
drew Carnegie, Carl Schurz, Wlnslow and
most the Democratic leaders In tne North
who have expressed opinions on the Phil
ippine question By all means bring the
House to a vote on the resolution in case
it receives the approval of Mr. Bryan.
Since the fall of 1S96 Mr. Hugh II. Hanna
has devoted himself to bringing about
such legislation as will place the country
upon the gold basis and protect Its cur
rency against disturbances which can have
their origin in the Treasury Department.
The holding of the monetary convention
early In 1S97, the appointment of the
monetary commission, the promulgation of
its bill and the efforts to pass It In the last
Congress, were all due to the intelligent
leadership of Mr. Hanna. Before the elec
tion of 1S9S Mr. Hanna caused the impor
tance of financial legislation to be dwelt
upon in many congressional districts. He
has been tireless in his efforts, which have
been directed with excellent Judgment. To
the cause he has devoted his energies and
his means. The bill, which was passed
yesterday by the House, owes Its success
more to his efforts, and those of Mr. Over
street, than to those of any other men. It
is not the measure he first advocated, but
It contains all Its essential features re
garding the soundness and the security of
the currency. Recognition In the hour of
victory is small reward for the sacrifice
he has made.

show attraction of herself in Paris will

To the Editor of the Indianapolis Journal:
A few days ago the Journal editorially ad
vised the authorities of Iowa, who seem
to be Investigating the normal school ques
tion with an eye to possible modifications
of their present system, to conform theirs
to ours by building one monster school and
bestowing all State favors upon it, and It
referred to the sucess of our State Normal.
Let me help those investigators by pre
senting a few facts and figures which
ought to be taken into account. First of
all is the fact that we have in our state
school a most excellent institution; good
buildings, a good library and other appoint
ments and an abie faculty of forty-four ac
complished teachers, who give instruction
all the way from geography through all the
branches usually taught in colleges of the
liberal arts as well as lessons In the science
of teaching, music, drawing and the like,
and no Institution does Its work better;
hence we will not blush when Iowa comes
to Investigate. That the State had appro
priated $1,023,901.77 up to Jan. 1, 1807, and
that it has appropriated 5223,037.63 since is
no matter if we ought to maintain a normal
school at public expense, for we are abund
antly able to spend twice as much if nec
essary and so Is the State of Iowa. But
there are some collateral facts that Iowa
should know before determining to follow
after us. For instance, there were en
rolled in the normal schools of Indiana In
the school year lSnS-99 6,992 students, only
1.138 of whom "were in the State Normal.
It could have accommodated 1.000 more in
Its ample buildings and with its splendid
library and other appointments, but for
reasons not necessary to menuon In detail
less than one in six of those seeking normal
instruction chose to go to this State
school, and of those that did more
than half were from twenty counties
convenient to Terre Haute. 1S9 being from
Vigo county alone, approximately one In
six of the whole patronage. That this was
not an exceptional year is seen in the fact
that in the 16.937 that have been enrolled
from the beginning 2.564 have been from
Vigo county. Ought we advise Iowa to
build a local school at such an expense?
It is a good thing to have, but is it the
best way to meet the demand for normal
Instruction? The plea of free tuition is mis
leading, for by the time contingent ex
penses are paid and the higher rates of
boarding are taken into account it proves
even more expensive to the student than
the expenses at equally good private
schools in the State, not to take into ac
count the cost "of transportation to so re
mote a part of the State; and yet the State
has appropriated for the year 1809 the neat
little sum of J71.0S3.96 for current expenses
alone, being $62.28 per student, and yet, on
an average, not relieving the student $10
in the year, so say nothing of the 5,854
other normal students who receive no state
aid whatever.-
After all, is not the New York system
better? That State has no pet normal
school on which It lavishes millions for
the benefit of a few. It provides that any
college or university may establish a nor
mal department, or any town or city may
build and equip a normal school, authoriz
ing a special tax for that purpose; or any
Individual may; and whenever any such
department or school is put under the gen
eral control of the board of regents as to
its curriculum and methods the State ren
ders aid alike to all. and that aid inures
to the benefit of the student, not to the
corporation, and only indirectly to the local
school. Under this regime there are twelve
normal schools in the State, all sharing
equitably In the funds of the State. There
are a dozen or more other local
normal schools which do good work
in a small way, but receive no
state aid because they do not meet the
requirements of the law. After all, is not
this system better than ours, and would it
not be wise for us, as well as Iowa, to
adopt It and to help the 6.992 students all
alike, instead (f spending it all upon 1,138,
and after all relieving only a part of them
from any appreciable burden? In fact the
Indianapolis Normal School is the only one
in the State that furnishes free tuition. It
is small and unpretentious, but It does as
good work as the best of them, and Its
graduates hold no second rank among
teachers. Only forty-nine students were
enrolled in 1S0S-99, but there were more in
regular attendance in proportion to en
rollment than In any other normal school
in. the State. These were taught at an ex
pense of Sl.d50.05 a fraction less than $40
per student. While thus supplying Its own
normal Indianapolis contributed to the sup
port of the State Normal $5,043.20, and had
but four students In it at a cost of 51.260.80
per student, and those four could have re
ceived as good instruction at home without
putting the city to a dollar's additional ex
pense and to the saving by each of them
of $22.50 and railroad fare to and from
Terre Haute two or more times.
It Is hardly necessary to add that the
graduates of the State Normal are In no
sense superior to the graduates of the
other normal schools of the State; they
command no better places p.nd do no better
work. Among the best educators in the
State are the graduates of these private
schools, our able state superintendent be
ing one of them, and none of these schools
has ever asked that its graduates be ex
cused from examination on applying for
a teacher's license, as the State Normal
did. I would advise the Iowa authorities
to not venture upon so expensive a luxury
as one mammoth normal school to the neg
lect of five-sixths of the students equally
entitled to aid, and even Indiana can afford
to study the situation in the light of the
facts and figures in the case. U. L. SEE.

BC0KS FOR THE YOUNG.
An Undivided Union.
The outline and incomplete material for
this story were left among the papers of
the late Oliver Optic, and were put into
the hands of Mr. Edward Stratemeyer to
be completed and prepared for publication.
Mr. Stratemeyer had himself written a
number of patriotic stories and was well
qualified to carry out Mr. Adams's (Oliver
Optic's) ideas. This book is the concluding
one of a series relating to the civil war,
written by Mr. Adams. It relates the ad
ventures of the Kentucky "Rlverlawn Cav
alry," which body is taken through the
Tennessee campaign and participates with
honor in the great battle of Chickamauga.
Many daring feats are accomplished and
the troop does its part toward preserving
an "undivided Union." Oliver Optic's
books were and still are great favorites
with, young readers, and justly so.
Each contains a wholesome story well told,
and a story containing much accurate in
formation of various sorts. If the rising
generation can learn something about the
great civil war through fiction, it is well,
since It Is but the barest outline that can
be taught in school, and more elaborate
histories are too formidable for young
readers to undertake willingly. The pub
lishers, Lee & Shepard (Boston), pay this
tribute to the author: "All who had
any connection I with the publica
tion of Mr. Adams's works loved
the man, and hi3 visits were marked with
cheerful words for. each . one, in whatever
capacity employed,!. that will linger help
fully while life remains. All who knew
him Join in honoring the unfailing kindness
and clean true nature of this great writer
and noble friend of youth."
The Book of Knight and Barbara.
This most unique book for children Is by
no less a person than David Starr Jordan,
president of Stanford University. The vol
ume consists of a series of tales such as an
ingenious and scientific parent with a
gifted imagination and no regard whatever
for the probabilities entertains his babies
with at their bedtime. They are, in fact,
nearly all nonsense stories. The illustrations
are after crude drawings made by children.
The author tells about it all in a preface.
He says the only apology he. can offer is
that he never meant to do It. He had told
his own children many stories of many
kinds, "some imitative, some original, some
travesties of the work of real story-tellers."
Two students in the department of
education in the university asked him to
repeat-these stories before other children.
One of these students, a stenographer,
took the stories down and afterward wrote
them out, forming the main text of this
book. Copies of the stories were placed
In the hands of many children, who drew
illustrative pictures after their fashion.
Out of these pictures the two students
mentioned selected what they considered
to be the best, not from an artistic stand
point, but as illuminative of the child-mind.
Included also are some drawings by uni
versity students, and at the close of the
volume a few true stories, mostly of birds
and beasts, told to a different audience. It
is a book that will interest and amuse
mature readers and at the same time af
ford entertainment to the little ones. D.

Mother Goose, by Op per.
Frederick Opper has tried his hand at il
lustrating the rhymes and jingles of
"Mother Goose," and it is almost like mak
ing the acquaintance of the old classic
anew to find them In the unfamiliar set
ting. Mr. Opper explains that his prede
cessors have handled this work with the
single Idea of pleasing only the child, and
adds: "While I have kept the tastes of
young folks steadfastly In view in mak
ing the Illustrations for this book, yet the
general plan which I have followed might
be called, perhaps, the eighty-year plan,
inasmuch as I have aimed to furnish in
terest and diversion for anybody up to the
age of eighty years." Wo dou"bt he has
succeeded, for it is unlikely that any one,
young or old, could fail to find entertain
ment In this volume. The Illustrations. 250
in number, are all in black and white, and
this In itself makes the volume desirable to
those -who have hesitated 'to put the com
mon editions with crude colored pictures
into the hands of children.' The volume will
make a handsome and desirable addition to
a child's library. Published by the J. B.
Lipplncott Company. Philadelphia.
Chi id-Verne.
Some of the poems in this little volume
of John B. Tabb's were written with chil
dren for their theme, some with the
thought of children or fancies suggested
by children In the author's mind:
"The baby has no skies
But mother's eyes,
Nor any God above
But mother's love.
Ills angel .sees the father face,
But he the mother's, full of grace;
And yet the heavenly kingdom Is
Of such as this."
Of the bluebird he writes:
"When God made a host of them
One little flower still lacked a stem
To hold its blossoms blue;
So into it He breathed a song.
And suddenly, with petals strong
As wings, It flew away."
The book Is handsomely printed on heavy
paper, with one poem to each of its seventy-eight
pages. Small, Maynard & Co.,
Boston, publishers.
Two Chnnis.
This is a story of a little French boy
and his dog. The child was left alone In
the world by the death of his grandmother,
and, following her last directions, came to
this country as an emigrant, his dog, a
big St. Bernard, accompanying. The boy
could speak no English and could not
make his wants known after arriving in
New York, until after long Wandering he
happened into a French umbrella mender's
shop. This Frenchman was a cruel, avar
icious wretch, and seeing the chance of a
little profit through the tricks of the dog
and the horn playing of the boy he kept
both, but starved and otherwise abused
them shamefully. Their adventures with
him, their escape, their making of kinder
friends and their subsequent good ior
tune go to make up a pleasant story of
the kind most boys and girls like. The
story Is written by Minerva Thorpe and
published by Laird & Lee, Chicago.
Beck's Fortune.
For some unexplained reason the greater
number of books for young readers are
written for boys rather than girls. "Beck's
Fortune" Is intended for girls; is, in fact, a
boarding-school story, a variety always
pleasing to the little maids who hope some
aay to attend such a school themselves.
"Beck" is a girl whose home is with a
mlsprlv erandfathpr. rt-nrl until cha la nc
fourteen she has none of the pleasures and
privileges common to happy girlhood.

An Alphabet of Celebrities.
This is another nonsense book for holiday
use Issued by Small, Maynard & Co., Bos
ton. The alphabet Is Illustrated by Oliver
Herford in rhyme and verse, thus:
"N Is Napoleon, shrouded in gloom,
With Nero, Narcissus and Nordau, to
whm
He's explaining the manual of arms with
a broom."
And thus:
"Q is the Queen, so noble and free
For further particulars look under V."
The drawings show that the artist is a
humorist as well. The book is handsomely
printed.
Old Father Gander.
Old Father Gander Is said to be the better
half of Mother : Goose, and the rhymes,
chimes and Jingles are "scratched from his
own goose quill for American goslings."
The goose quill and the pencil and brush
used in the illustrations belong to Walter
Scott Howard. It is hardly to bo expected
that these rhymes will take the place of
"Mother Goose," since they are of a widely
different character, but some of them are
very good in their way. They are, in fact.
better than the illustrations, which are too
grotesque In conception to be Suitable for
a child's book. The book Is well printed on
heavy paper. Published by L. C. Page

Kin Pippin.
This Is a story of a small English boy
whose father was a sailor and whose
mother was ill and was required by the
doctors to go with her husband for her
health on a sea voyage that would last a
year. The boy, "King Pippin," went to
live with his grandmother during his moth
er's absence. He was a very sweet little
boy and used to much petting; his grand
mother was stern and severe and not fond
of children. Consequently he had an un
happy time, and, at last, a very serious
adventure that came near costing him his
life. He recovered, however, his parents
came home and all ended happily. It is a
gentle, innocuous tale, suitable for reading
to children too small to be critical or to
demand something more exciting. Written
by Mrs. Gerard Ford and published by L.
C. Page & Co., Boston.
A Little Girl in Old Philadelphia.
This story, by Amanda M. Douglas, is
an account of a little orphan girl one of
whose parents had been a Quaker, the
other one of the "world's people." Some
property being involved on both sides, she
had two guardians and was required to
spend one-half of each year, until she
reached the age of twenty-one, with each
of them. One guardian was a Quaker, the
other a lady of fashion, and the child thus
had a variety of experience, and the con
trast between the life on the farm among
the Friends and In the gay society of the
city Is vivid. After a time came the revo
lutionary war to add to other interests and
excitement. A pretty romance is woven
Into the tale. It Is a sweet and pleasing
story, and one to put into the hands of
young 'irls. Published by Dodd, Mead &
Co., New York.
The Story of the Aeneld.
Virgil's great epic poem Is 'here put into
the form of an English story by Dr. Ed
ward Brooks, whose purpose Is to give boys
and girls a summary of the classic tale
suited to their capacity. He hopes and a
commendable hope it is that an early ac
quaintance with the leading incidents of
the Latin poem may aid in the culture of a
taste for the better forms of literature
among the youth of the country. He has
necessarily omitted much detail, but has

Told Under the Cherry Tree.
This story, by Grace Le Baron, is an ac
count of the experience of the pupils of
a village school under a teacher whom they
all loved, of the happenings in the village
anu of the life of some of the little ones
after they left the place. One boy, who
had been a waif, but kindly treated, by
the people of the village and cared for in
their homes wherever he wished to stay,
was grateful for the kindness received and
the closing chapters relate how he paid his
debt. It is a simple little tale of a distinct
moral tone. Lee & Shepard, Boston, pub

REAL BULLETS ON THE STAGE.
Two Aotor Wounded Dnrinj? a Per
formance at Phoenix, A. T.
CHICAGO. Dec. 18. A dispatch to the
Record from Phoenix, A. T., says: There
was a tragic ending of the performance of
"Don Caesar" by "The Three Musketeers'
company, in which Paul Gilmore Is lead
ing man, at the opera house here late Sat
urday night. In the fourth act one mem
ber of the company, in accordance with
the lines of the play, opened fire on a
group of other actors. The fire was re
turned by half a dozen other pistols and
the ensuing scene was one of confusion.
Faul Gilmore and David Halbert fell to
the floor in a manner which could not be
mistaken for a piece of acting. They were
seriously but not fata'lly wounded. Mean
while the leaden missiles rattled about the
stage and in various parts of the opera
house. The audience of about 4,000 persons
stantpeded, yelling, "Fire!" "Murder!" and
everything else calculated to create a
panic. In the midst of the excitement the
lights went out and women screamed. The
crowd in its hurry to escape from the
building packed at the doors, and every
thing had quieted before a majority of the
people could force themselves out.
The pistols used were thirty-eight caliber
and they had been carried by the troupe
for some time. When the performance
was about ready to begin it was discov
ered that the company's supply of blank
cartridges had been exhausted. What a
clerK declared to be blank cartridges were
purchased and used in the weapons. They
had the appearance of being balnks, but
hidden at a depth behind each wad was a
ball of lead, ten or twelve of these balls
have since been dug out of the walls of the
opera house.
KINSLEY UNSHAKEN.
IlandTrritlna: Expert Maintains Ills
Position in Molineux Trial.
NEW YORK, Dec. 18. In the trial of
Roland B. Molineux to-day, William J.
Kinsley, the handwriting expert, was
again cross-examined by Barton S. Weeks.
No other witness was examined during the
day. The evidence was technical in the
extreme. Though Mr. Weeks asked many
questions that seemed to annoy and em
barrass the witness at times, on the whole
he was unable to shake the position of the
expert or to induce him to waver in his
contention that Molineux wrote the ad
dress on the famous poison package.
Mollneux's wife and mother were both
present in court this morning. As they left
the courtroom at the noon recess they had
a most trying experience. The crowd
pressed upon them, every individual in it
seeming to be possessed of a wild desire to
get within reaching distance of the pretty
young woman and the sad faced older one.
Finally, with the assistance of a police
man, the trembling women were half
dragged through the crowd to the broad
marble stairs. Even then the crowd did
not desist, but followed and pressed them,
peeping into their faces and commenting
upon their appearance. The two women
finally escaped Into the street, and with
General Molineux were driven hastily
away. On account of this rude ordeal the
women decided not to return to the court
room during the afternoon.
Mr. Cleveland's Rheumatism.
P1UNCETON. N. J.. Dec. IS. Dr. James
Wickhoff, ex-President Cleveland's phy
sician, said to-day: "Mr. Cleveland is suf
fering from a slight attack of rheumatism
in his left foot, which was brought on by
his becoming chilled Friday, while out
driving. It is a recurrence of an attack
which he had two weeks ago, but Is not at
all serious. I was at his home again this
morning and found him improving very
much. He doubtless will be able to go out
again within a day or two."
PERRY S. HEATH'S PLANS
HE WILL. SOON BEGIN ORGANIZING
THE LITERARY BUREAU.
Will Assist the Republican National
Committee Without Neglecting
His Official Duties.
Special to the Indianapolis Journal.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 18. Perry S.
Heath, first assistant postmaster general,
who has been named as chairman of the
subcommittee on organization and litera
ture for the campaign of 1900, is inter
viewed as follows by the Washington Star
this afternoon regarding hls plans. He
said:
"When Chairman Hanna and Secretary
Dick return from their holiday visit home
there will be a meeting of the comraittee
and then the work 'will be mapped out.
Meanwhile there is nothing I can say about
it. As far as my selection is concerned
I am particularly gratified. It Is an honor
I did not expect."
Mr. Heath said in reply to a query that
there would be nothing incompatible with
the duties of the committee and his of
ficial position and that he did not contem
plate a severance with the postal service.
He added, with italicised emphasis, that
it was his purpose to remain in his official
position until the end of the present admin
istration. It is understood that In the early
part of January quarters will be secured
and opened in Washington for the com
mittee in connection with the regular
headquarters of the Republican commit
tee. The Star concludes a biographical sketch
of Colonel Heath with this passage: "One
of President McKinley's rirst acts was to
name Mr. Heath as first assistant post
master general and it is no exaggeration to
say his department is one of the most ef
ficient in tne government. His dutlef, how
ever, have not taicen him out of tue reach
of his friends and he Is the same affable,
courteous Perry as of old. During his
official life Mr. Heath has materially as
sisted in the advancement of postofllce
clerks throughout the country and Is a
firm believer in organized labor. He knows
what it is to be a toiler, and his best en
deavors are always put forth to render
justice to the laboring classes. Typo
graphical assemblies all over the United
States have recently passed commendatory
resolutions of his earnest support of or
ganized labor. Mr. Heath is a stanch
friend of President McKinley and enjoys
his confidence."
The Indiana delegation to the Republican
national convention will be quartered at
the Walton, the swellest hotel in Philadel
phia. Nearly all of the Indianapolis representa
tives will spend the holiday recess at their
homes. Senator Beverldge will reach In
dianapolis the first of next week. Senator
Fairbanks has not yet decided whether he
can indulge himself in a home flitting.
The senator and Mrs. Fairbanks will give
a dinner and reception to Governor Mount
on Saturday evening of this week.
Inspector General Breckinridge's annual
report to the geneal commanding is this
year a searching review of the conduct of the
army and an expert criticism of its organi
zation of the most Interesting and valuable
character. It Is an unusually voluminous
document with many excellent photo
graphic illustrations, and will prove enter
taining and Instructive, not only to officers
of the service but to legislators who will be
called on to consider needed reforms in the
service. It is notable that , nearly all the
Inspector general's suggestions were adopt
ed by Secretary Root in his recommenda
tions to Congress. General Breckinridge
says: "All experience shows that we may
periodically have war and our late mere
mobilization shows what Inexperience may
cost and cause us and our children to en
dure. Sanitation where there are no
modern conveniences is more difficult
to enforce among greenhorns than the
manual of arms and musketry, and the
more troops go under canvas and learn tac
tical operations on the ground and how to
take care of themselves the better it will
be for the army, especially for the new or
ganization called out for the defense of our
country's flag. Our present transport fleet
has excited the admiration of foreigners
and is perhaps as fine as a lavish expendi
ture of money could so quickly make it
under a department of the government
which was almost a novice in this work
and not controlled entirely by men who
have made such matters a life study."
Senator Pettlgrew, of South Dakota, to
day introduced a joint resolution tendering
to Rear Admiral Winfleld Scott Schley and
the officers and men under his command
the thanks of Congress "for highly dis
tinguished conduct in conflict with the
enemy, as displayed by him in the destruc
tion of the Spanish fleet off the harbor of
Santiago July 3, 1898.
The Senate to-day confirmed Joseph A.
Gill, of Kansas, to be judge of the United
States Court for the Northern district of
Indian Territory. It also confirmed numer
ous army and navy promotions.
The United States Supreme Court will
adjourn next Friday for the Christmas
holidays, resuming its sittings again on
Monday-, Jan. 8.
The War Department has settled In ad
vance an interesting question as to the
application of civil or military law in the
case of a soldier killed by two sentinels
of the Tenth Cavalry while trying to es
cape near Fort Crook, Neb. The state au
thorities were about to step in before the
court-martial, when Attorney General
Griggs, at the instance of the War De
partment, telegraphed to-day United States
District Attorney Somer. at Omaha, to
appear for the defense ad place his serv
ices at the disposal of General Merrlam.
This means that the United States courts
will take jurisdiction over the case and
that It cannot be tried by the State of Ne
braska. The Navy Department has arranged to
give a naval funeral to the remains of the
late Lieutenant Brumby. A company of
marines from the barracks here, with the
full Marine Band, have been ordered to
report at Garfield Hospital, under charge
of Commander McCrea, to-morrow morn
ing, to escort the remains to the railway
station, whence they will be conveyed to
Atlanta, Ga., for interment.
A dispatch to Senor Pulldo. the Venezu
elan charge, states that the revolution Is
crushed and that Hernandez's force Is com
pletely destroyed. Details are not slven.
The engagement occurred on the 14th, and

Senor Pulido regards the information such
as to justify the belief that the disorder
In Venezuela is at an end and that peace
will be restored.
SENATE PROCEEDINGS.
More Philippines Resolutions Mr.
Morgan After Trusts.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.-What the Sen
ate may accomplish in ihe way of legisla
tion for the Philippines during the pres
ent session is problematical, but that the
question will be thoroughly discussed Is
Indicated by the number of resolutions
bearing on it being introduced. In oppo
sition to the retention by the United States
of the Philippine islands two resolutions
were introduced to-day, one ,by Mr. Till
man and the other by Mr. Bacon. Each
resolution purposes to yield the Islands to
a government to be established by the Fil
ipinos themselves.
Mr. Morgan addressed the Senate briefly
upon the necessity of legislation to con
trol trusts, and had his joint resolution
against them referred to the judiciary
committee. He said he regarded the evlli
called trusts as all included in the com
missions of persons to control trade. What
an Individual could acompllsh In trade
was regarded as legitimate, but when
great corporations were aggregated to
gether to control any given branch of
trade or commerce or transportation it
became evident that the rights ot the peo
ple were likely to be Infringed. He de
clared that all the advantages which had
been gained by the trust had been ob
tained at the expense of the people, and
particularly of labor, and "I desire to
know." he said, "whether this Congress
wdl respond to the almost despairing de
mand of the people for reuef." The coal
and iron lands of his own State of Ala
bama and of Tennessee had. he said,
passed into the maws of the trusts, but had
not passed from under control of the States.
The Legislatures of these States never
would consent to the holding of those lands
by trusts, ana ne Intimated that measures
would be taken by the representatives of
the people to protect their interests.
A bill to restore to their original status
as to promotion of officers of the navy and
marine corps losing numbers by reason of
the advancement of otner officers for ex
ceptional and meritorious service during

President pro tem. Frye presented a me
morial, elaborately bound and engrossed,
of the citizens of Hawaii, adopted at a
meeting in Honolulu on July 4 last. The
memorial recited that much uncertainty
exists, owing to the failure of Congress-to
provide a form of government for the Ha
waiian islands and asked that the ter-.
ritorial laws of the United States be ex- "
tended to Hawaii. The memorial was re
ferred to the committee on Pacific Islands
and Porto Rico.
Mr. Mason presented numerous petitions
expressing sympathy with the Soutn Af
rican republics in their war with Great
Britain.
Mr. Thurston presented the credentials
of his recently appointed colleague, former
Senator W. V. Allen, and they were read.
Governor Poynter's commission named
Mr. Allen as senator until his successor
had been elected and had qualified. To
this Mr. Chandler (N. rt.) took exception,
pointing out that Mr. Allen could hold his
seat only till the Legislature should meet. ,
"Of course." said Mr. Chandler, "that part
of the credentials must be regarded as
void."
After an executive session the Senate
aaopted a House resolution appoint
ing a committee to attend the recep
tion and unveiling of the statue of Daniel
Webster in this city on Jan. IS, 1900.
President Frye appointed on the part of
the Senate Messrs. Chandler. Allison and
Bacon.

SCANDAL IN MICHIGAN
MILITARY BOARD ALLEGED TO
HAVE SWIM) LCD THE STATE.
CharRed with Selling Supplies to m
Fake Company for Little and Bur
In Them Back at Big Trices.
LANSING, Mich., Dec. 18. According to
allegations made here to-day, based on re
sults of grand Jury investigations, the
State Military Board Is alleged to have
sold, last July, to the Illinois Supply Com
pany, of Chicago, for $10,500, absolutely
new clothing, goods and equipments, esti
mated to have inventoried at least $33,000.
It Is further alleged that what are alleged
to be the same goods were soon afterwards
purchased by the board from the Hender
son & Ames Manufacturing Company, of
Kalamazoo. .
It is alleged to be a fact that the "Illlonls
Supply Company" was a fake concern, cre
ated by persons Interested with the Kala
mazoo company for purposes only of the
alleged sale. It Is stated that at the same
meeting at which the board decided to. sell
these goods a resolution was adopted au
thorizing the quartermaster general to
purchase an equipment of precisely the
same class of goods, and that this was done
at a cost of over $00,000. The goods, it is
alleged, were sold to "The Illinois Supply
Company" without the company having
seen them.
A draft for. $10,500 was soon received, and
four carloads of goods were shipped from
the State Armory to Chicago. Addison C.
Cobb, an employe of the Chicago Beach Ho
tel, received them there, It is alleged, and
without breaking the seals reshlpped them
to the Henderson-Ames Company at Kala
mazoo. Governor Plngree was subpoenaed by the
grand jury last week but It appeared from
his testimony that knowledge of the char
acter of this transaction had been with
held from the Governor.
Governor Pingree refused to talk upon the
military board scandal. The expose har
caused a tremendous sensation. The board
seems to be further implicated to-night on
account of a flat denial from Attorney Gen
eral Oren that he ever advised Quarter
master General White in the matter of the
alleged fraudulent sale or purchase.
PIXGREE'S MESSAGE.
Michigan's Governor Urges Further
Taxation of Railways.
LANSING, Mich., Dec. IS. The Michigan
Legislature met In special session at noon
to-day in response to call of Governor Pln
gree. The Governor's object is to secure
passage of a joint resolution providing
for submission to the people at the general
election next November of an amendment
to the State Constitution placing railways
on the same basis for taxation as all other
property. At . present the railroads pay
specific taxes upon gross earnings. Inter
est in the special session is Increased by
the fact that the grand jury, which has re
turned indictments alleging bribery
against some of the legislators, is still in
session h-rre. Speaker Adams, of the
House of Representatives, who Is one of
the indicted men, presided to-day as usual.
The message of Governor Plngree was
read this afternoon before the joint ses
sion of the two houses. It urged passage
of the proposed joint resolution so as to
permit enactment of laws' by the next
Legislature for equal taxation of all prop
erty at Us true cash value. Said the Gov
ernor: "The inequality of our system of
taxation is so great that immediate steps
should be taken to remedy It." The ques
tion involved had for years been exhaust
ively discussed, and was therefore no
longer properly open for debate, but called
for energetic action. Governor Pingree re
ferred to the history of the Atkinson rail
way taxation act, which was declared un
constitutional by the State Supreme Court
and recalled the fact that a Joint resolu
tion of similar purport to the one now
proposed passed the House during the
regular session, but died in the Senate
committee. He called particular atten
tion to a clause in the Michigan Repub
lican platform of 18, which commended
the Pingree administration for its efforts
in the direction of equal taxation and fa
vored immediate legislation for taxing
railroad, telegraph, telephone and express
properties upon their true value. The mes
sage urged that the matter be considered
only as a matter of principle.
The Governor submitted a table showing
the comparative value of railway property
in the States which most nearly resemble
Michigan in population and development.
and stating the value at which Michigan's
railway property would be assessed if
worth as much per mile as such property
In the other States mentioned, namely,
Indiana. Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
His deduction from this was that Michi
gan railroad property based on such val
ues would pay several times the amount
of revenue to the State which they now
do. The Governor concluded by saying:
"It is well for you to remember that there
are only three States in the Union in
which railroads jay specific taxes upxa
the gross earnings."
