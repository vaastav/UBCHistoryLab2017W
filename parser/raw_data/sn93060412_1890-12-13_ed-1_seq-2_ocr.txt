THE DRAMATIC OSITIO-
We saw In a contemporary a day or
two ago a head lino "Do our Dramatic
Grilles Abuse Their PriviloKes?"
placed over the complaint of au actor
that "newspaper critics ofteu do uot
know the inside dealings ot a com
pany." It that were all, the public
would not be a sufferer as otten as it is.
The truth is, that while there is a good
deal of rot on the stage there is an
equal amount of it in the so-called criti
cism of what is done there. Tromis
cuoua puffing is,ot course, disagreeablo
but even that is better than ceiiBiir
where it ia not deserved, and which is
ouly bestowed for the purpose
professing the nil admirari in order to
gain a reputation for knowing some
thing. If it were only that the critic
'does uot know the inside workings ol
a company" the public might have no
right to complain. This or that minor
actor might be suppressed in glory to
loud greater eflulgence to a star, but
th? ' ?on?8t 8,'temC lbB WBI
aubdued or alighted would be true.and
truth ia the most desirable of all things,
It was the sum of all beauty ,the fullness
of all Justice, the heart of science, and
tbe soul of art.
Dramatic critics abuse their privi
leges, however, not so much because
they do not know the peccadillos and
jealousies of actors, aa that they do not
understand the art which they attempt
to write of. It is hardly to be expected
that they should themselves possess the
creative genius of an Accins Paulus
the comprehensive knowledge of
Shakespeare, the versatility and purity
of diction ot an Addison, or tbe
patriotic fervor of a Leasing. These
v ere master builders of plays. But if
to write iguorantly even upon the
pedigree ot swine brings with it certain
exposure, then at least something
should be kuown of the drama by those
who write npon it. The person who
credits RIohelieu to Shakespeare, who
speaks of Dryden as a great playwright
who has never even beard of Moliere
of Terence or ot Rabelais,! everywhere
posing as a "critic." The entre to tbe
theater, the two hours subsequently, to
write against space ;famlliarity with the
names of tbe authors ol"The Rsg
Baby," "The Brass Parrot," and "The
Keyhole in the Door Knob,' constitute
an equipment aud the patient public that
thinks it knows a good thing when it
sees it, is inexpressibly sold wbeu
it
seeks amusement guided by tbe "criti
cisin" of the press. So many extraneous
things come in to color this "criticism.''
A good looking woman here; a bottle
ot ehamuague there; a little snub,
perhaps; a curtailment of a dignity
When the public pays its penny for its
paper, it is not always that it gets its
money's worth of information here
There are honorable exceptions to
this rnle, for it is a rule. There are
here and there upon tbe press of tbe
country men whose work is in itself au
art. Whose praise ia worth something,
aud whose censure condemns a play or
player beyond redemption. These are
men of genius. They are men ot senbe.
They are honorable gentlemen. They
are not mere ioonoclasts. Tbey realize
that it is easier, much easier, to tear
down than to build up, and they would
rather praise than blame. A critic
need not be a cynic. Indeed cynicism
unfits him for his work.
One need not exactly be a carponter
in order to criticise tbe making of a
bench or box, but still there should at
least exist a knowledge of what is a
bench, what i3 a box. Too often, we
fear, the dramatic critic abuses his
privilege because be has not begun by
learning what is a play; and so care
less, slipshod and dishonest is much of
his work that tbe veteran play-goer
passes It by with that utter contempt,
which is so often marked with tbe
largest audiences to the most abused
plays and players,
THE ALLIANCE PROTESTS AGAINST
THE IOR0E BILL.
In view of tbe wonderfnl and decisive
part taken by the Farmers' Alliance in
he elections of last month, unusual
interest is felt In the deliberation of
tbe Farmers' Al'iance national conven
tion which assembled at Ocala, Florida,
Tbia convention represented nearly
every state in tbe nnion and tbe dele
gates are representative citizens oi
their respective states. There were no
cranks or hot-heads In that convention.
It was composed of tbonghttul, cool,
conservative, prudent and eminently
patriotic men men who, turning from
tbe plow and the workshop, said that
corruption and extravagance and aa-
ust taxation must ond and tnct section
alism should reign no longer. The
present congress has turned a deat ear
to this warning voice, and counselled
by a president unable to rise above his
malignity, has entered upon tbe work
of supplementing tbe injustice ot its
tariff measures with tbe inlamy of its
torce bill. In view of the president's
message and the determination of con
gress to torce mis measure npon me
country, tbe alliance In national con
vention assembled has adopted "unani
mously aud with the wildest eiitbusl
asm" tbe following patriotic resolutions:
Whereas, Tbe president of Ibe United
States iu bis annual message to congress
recommends and urges tbe immediate
passage of tbe measure known aa Ibe
Lodge election bill; and,
Whereas, bald bin involves a radica
revolution iu tbe election machinery ol

and lta paaaage will be fatal to the

liberties of ibe citizens; and,
Whereas, Bald bill is partisan in

of sectional estrangement t aud,

victory may crown our crusade, aud
fraternity and union reserve; therefore,
be it
Resolved by tbe National Farmers'
Alliance and Industrial Union of Amer
ica, In national council assembled,
That we do most solemnly protest
against tbe passage of said Lodge
election bill, most earnestly petition
onr senators to employ all lair and
legal means to defeat this unpatriotic
measnre, which can result In nothing
bat evil to our common and beloved
country.
Resolved, further, That a copy of
this preamble aud these resolutions be
forwarded to each senator iu congress.

A WORD ABOUT THE LOBBYIST.
It has bweti suggested that much ot
the difficulty and unseemly wrang
ling over tho appropriations necessary
to sustain the state university could be
avoided it a lobby for the purpose of
securing litem was not biennially sent
to the capital to alllict tbe legislature
If the board of curators would make a
fair estimate, send one or twoot lliei
number to present and explain the
natter to the proper committee, am
then go home, there is not a shadow o
a doubt that tbe legislature woul
cheerfully make the required appropri
atioii. It is tho university lobby at Ibe
capital that makes tho average legisla
tor suspicious of jobs aud extravagant
domands,and briigs tbe university into
disrepute.
A similar suggestion might be mad
concerning the railroads. If the rail
roads would keep their professional
lobbyists at borne they would certainly
fare no worse, aud probably betler,at tbe
hands ot the legislature. The people of
the stale have no desire to cripple tbe
railroad corporations or impose upon
them unnecessary burdens or restric
lions. All that is demanded ot them Is
that they pay their jus', proportion ot
the taxes, furuiau reasonable facilities
to Ibe public aud treat all the citizens
of Ihe state with equal fairness.
There would be little iuimical leg
islation if the railroad lobbyist himself
did uot secretly have it introduced that
be might have something to oppose and
defeat, and thereby give color to the
uocessity for his employment. A
disreputable crowd ol boodle dispensers
naturally excite prejudice against the
corporations employing them, and the
honest representative of the people
sometimes goes to the extent of being
unjust in order to manifest his resent
meut aud indignatiou.
If tho committees having railroad
legislation in charge desire information
tbey would prefer seeking it at
headquarters and from the proper
officers. Nor would they refuse
respectful hearing from the respectable
representative of any corporation
whose interests might be in jeopardy
by tbe proposed legislation.
Tbe railroads, especially, should
learu that their interests must suffer
whenever tbey are in the hands of
dishonest gang wbo make their living
by debauching legislatures and cor
rupting the representatives ot the
people.
A farmers' legislature will be &i the
helm this winter, ana we would advise
our corporations to consider well the
suggestion we have made.
Aud as to the university we write
every word in love and charity, tor we
should delight to see it honored and
fostered to even a greater extent tbau
ever in the past, and especially to eeeit
endowed, so that it could never again
tempt its friends into positions which
would prove hurtful to them.
Tbe possibility of tbe defeat ot the
election bill in tbe senate on a direct
vote on its passage was discussed last
Mouday iu republican circles aud one
republican senator went, so far as to
say that it would be policy for the
democratic senators to permit the do
bate to come to a speedy close and a vote
tobe taken before the Christmas holi
days. It the bill was not a parly meas
nre there would be no doubt ot its fate;
but the action of the republican caucus
informally declaring that the bill shall
pass will bind at least some of those
wbo do not favor tbe bill to vote for it
wbeu it is placed on its passage,
Whether this will hold enough doubt
ful republican votes to carry the
measure through is a debatable propo
sition. It is admitted by republican
senators that several republicau votes
will be cast against it. Mr. Stewart.
Mr. Plumb, Mr. Wolcott and Mr
Wasbburue a'e counted amoug those
who will likely vote in the negative
Mr, Teller is an extremely doubtful
quantity. He has publicly reseryed the
right to vote against the bill. Mr. Jones,
ot Nevada, has not been in Washington
since congress met, but Just before tbe
adjournment of the first session be
announced himself opposed to the bill
Mr. Paddock baa not determined how
he will vote, but he ia known to be
opposed to the peuding bill. Jugall
ia generally reckoned an opponent of
the meaanre, but his attitude toward it
may be affected by tbe senatorial situa
tion in Kansas. Mr. Davis la said to
be doubtful ot bis position. The re
publican majority iu the senate ia 12.
six republican votes in tbe negative
would defeat the election bill.
The proposition ot the international
opyright bill ia to permit foreignera
to take American copyright on the
same basis as American citizens, in
three cases t First, when the nation of
the foreigner permits popyright to
American citizens on substantially
the same basis aa its own citizens;
second, when the nation of tbe
foreigner gives to American citizens
copyright priviliges similar to those
provided in this bill; third4 when the
nation of the foreigner is a party to an
inler-national agreement providing
for reciprocity in copyright by the
terms of wbicb agreement tbe tJnited
Stales can become a party thereto at its
pleasure. A subsidiary, but important
proposition of tbe bill is that ail books
copyrighted ondor Ibe proposed act
shall be printed irom type sot within
tho United Ulat.es or from plates made
therefrom.
Mr. Quay is reported as saying that it
tue lorce Dili is passca mere wjll be a
majority of Irom AO-OQO to 100,000 votp
against the republican parly in New
York in 1192. Under tbe present
political alignment the Empire state is
tliaiu to cagt its vote for the tariff
reform parly iu 1892, but the force bill
ought to be deleated just tbe same.
Tbey are making a good deal of fun

A strike has been inaugurated in the
Clark thread mills at Newark, N. J.
A dispatch from Washington says
that the . Republic's correspondent
learned that Senator Quay has a
substitute for tbe lorce bill prepared,
which he will offer in tho senate in a
lew d-iy. It is understood, says tho
Itepublic, that ho has a much stronger,
a more candid and a more complete
lorce bill to offer tbau the one prepared
by Johnny Davenport, which passed
Ihe house aud was subsequently modi
fled by him for use iu the senate. Tbe
dispatch continues: "Quay has been
opposed to tbe torce bill up to this time,
but he believes that if a measure of tbe
kind is necessary at all it should go the
whole length and be able to do beyond
doubt aud neradventure what the
pending bill was intended to do. "Mr
Quay's substitute will be strong enough
to make negroes vote whether thev
want to or not aud to make them
vote the republican ticket. It will be
strong enough to make it extremely
dangerous for a democrat intending to
vote bis' party ticket to approach the
polls. It will bo strong enough, in
fact, if it should become a law, to send
all the democrats in the United States
to Mexico, Canada or Siberia. I' ie
not probable that Mr. Quay's substitute
will be submitted tor some days to
come, but wbeu it is, it will attract
attention. He will make a speech in
explanation and support of his proposi
lion. The only time that Quay had
spoken in the senate up to date was
whan he read a brlet eulogy on tbe
life of Samuel J. Randall. His speech
ou his force bill will be listened to
attentively. He is the moat powerful
mail in tbe republicau party, has the
party machinery firmly in his grasp,
and consequently his somewhat sensa
tional movement will be looked for
with attention bordering on impatience
Judging from this paragraph the
reform, labor-republican-boodler-Fillev
members of the 35th geueral assembly
are tailing even lower than tbey have
heretofore been held, and that ia saying
a good deal. A St. Louis dispatch
says: "Late this afternoon detectives
Lawler aud Hard arrested Fred Swaiue
and G. J. O'Reilly, and brought them
lo the Four Courts, charged with
having for some time past been collect
ing money irom women of ill repute
uuder the pretense that it was to be
used in securing tbe passage by ibe
legislature at tbe coming session of
social evil law, which by regulating
such resorts aa the women keep, would
greatly improve their condition.
Swaine is an ex-member of tbe legisla
tore." This ia only a strengthening of
what we have elsewhere said to gen
tlemen in legitimate business against
joining in tbe lobby. It all runs
together before a session Is over, ai d
it is a stench in tbe nostrils ot decent
people.
This is a very nice compliment from
