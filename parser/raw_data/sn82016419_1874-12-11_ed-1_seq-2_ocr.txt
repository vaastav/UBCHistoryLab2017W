-o. ,r mo annual report of
mate Auaitor, J). VT. Wilder. cresU
ed a sensation. The one Jntt out
eclipses that made last year la many
respects. We hare not been favor
ed with an advance copy, by our es
teemed ft lend, the auditor, but have
been permitted to glance over a
copy we round in tbe hands of a
friend who was passing through our
city. We feel a little slighted that
we have not been furnished with a
copy.
We read enough of this report to
express the opinion that It, too, will
rream a senssuon. in the matters
of completeness, plain and blunt lan
guage, and the amount of valuable
information It gives of the financial
status and history of the state, it is
me moat remarkable state paper ev
cr issued In any state. It contalna
about fifty large pamphlet pasroa
and is replete with figures, giving
lust the information needed, not on
ly by the members of the incoming
legislature, but by all the people
Its style and matter are so inteseet-
Ing tbst when one sits down to read
it be does not wish to Isy it aside
until he has gone entirely through
it.
Mr. Wilder does not mince his
words In reflecting upou those who
have administered tbe various de
partments ot the state government.
We like the report on this account,
notwithstanding our toes are slight
ly tread upon along with those of
others. We had something to do with
framing the state printer law which
the Auditor criticises rather severe'
ly, and tbe reason we do not
"squeal" Is that he does not tell the
truth In his assertions about that
bill. We do not ssy he deliberately
falsifies. We suppose he has been
lead into error In some way. Had
he known how faithfully and hon
estly the work was done on that
bill, he would not have said it was
framed against the interests of the
people and In thoso of the public
printer. It Is the truth that hurts,
and Web's assertions do not wound
our feelings in tho lesst.
We suppose there are many other
statements In this remarkablo re
port which must he taken with
considerable degree of allowance,
but the mass of truth, and the
wonderful amount of Inlormatfon
it contains in statistical form, as
well as its fund of wise and practic
al suggestions, must lead to great
good to the state. This report is of
more practical value to the state
thsn all the state documents ever Is
sued, ltarrlog its overdrawu state
ments iu some Instances, its seem
ing anxiety to censure, Its distaste
ful egotism, in holding up its au
thor as the only officer who has
dono anything for Kansas, and its
chesp puff of two or three fellows,
it is all right. As we look at tho
matter it is decidedly out oftatse to
pun" officers who have dono their
duty, and to engage iu electioneer
ing for them, in a state report, sir.
Wilder doubtless thinks this all
right, and we shall not quarrel with
him about It. There is so mueh
that is good in this report, that its
faults are lost sight of.
To give some Idea of the matter
of this remarkable document, we
give briefly its "table of contents."
After preliminary remarks it be
gins with an examination of the an
nual expenditures of the state. Un
der this head a table is given, show
ing tho rate of taxation, tho amount
taxed, and the taxable property of
the state as fixed by the State Board
of Equalization for each year begin
ning with 18C1, and closing with
1874. Accompanying this Is a table
showing the latest reported valua
tion and rate of taxation in the dif
ferent slates of the Union. Next
the report gives a series of tables,
showing tho expenditures for slate
purposes, under the different heads,
lor each year since the state was ad
mitted. Special tables give the cost
of printing year by year, and the
amounts voted for uewspapors.
Then follows a table giving in total
the general revenue, and school and
interest taxes collected and paid out
each year from 1SC1 down. These
tables, it Is needless to say. furnish
a class of Information which has
heretofore been Inaccessible, and of
the highest interest and importance.
The auditor then discusses at length
the various subjects, manuscript
journals ; double and crroucous as
sessments; commission and mile
age to county treasurers; public
printing ; the Insurance department ;
investigation of school funds; the
bond registration law, with a table
showing the municipal bonds regis
tered in 1874; the fiscal agency;
bank statements ; fees and salaries ;
the standing of railroads; the state
debt, with a table showing the date
of Issue, lor what purpose, rate of
interest, terms of payment, &c, of
all the bonds ever issued by the
state; the sinking fund ; sale of In
dian land ; repeal of laws ; the state
relief bonds ; county organization ;
school land account: condition of
the treaaurv: proceedings of the
State Hoard of Equalization; tabu
lar statement of the taxable proper

by the state board, and tbe amount
of taxes apportioned to each county
for the year 1874 ; tabular statement
of the railroad property or the state
by counties; bow much our taxes

A quorum of both houses present.
The most of the session was occu
pied by tho reading of the
President's message.
All the Kansas delegates were
present
In the Senate Senator Ingalls
introduced a bill providing that
the pre-emption settlers in Kansas,
shall be allowed a year's absence
from their lands ravaged by grass
hoppers without loss of their
rights. He also submitted a reso
lution instructing the committee
on Indian affairs to inquire into
the recent disturbances in the In
dian territory, and to report to the
senate what measures were neces
sary to protect life and property
and preserve the law and order in
that region, and whether the best
Interests of civilization do not de
mand the immediate establishment
of courts of United States inside
of the territory. Laid on the ta
ble.
Senator Hitchcock, of Nebraska,
introduced a bill appropriating
$100,000 for the purchase of food
to be issued to the starving suf
ferers from the ravages of the
grasshoppers on the Western fron
tier.
In the house the first bill intro

Hesitation of these sublime virtues has
passed away. Never has tbe service
of the nation been so utterly empty
and void of great men, high alms and
noble efforts: so dull, listless and me
diocre. It Is tbe hour and power of
vulgarity, of uttei . purposeless mate
rialism, of undisguised selfishness, and
blank vacuity. When tbe ty pioal deni

die with Butler, we might well rejoice
As It is, a negative victory has been
won, but we need a positive one. As
we look upon our public affairs.
mighty advertisement stares us in tbe
fur: u Wanted, a great moral hero!"
Hay God send such men Into the field
of our national life! For, looking
back of the record of the last four
years, at Back Pay, Credit Moblller,
our home bribery suits, we must con
fess that, boast of our bigness as wi
may, talk of the "effete despotisms of
Europe" as we will, our public con
science Is more debuacbeil, and our
civil service incomparably worse, than
that of anv other nation in Christen
doni. We are sufferinsr from our old
Fourth-of-July fallacy.
The above statements are selected
from Mr. Norton's Thanksgiving
sermon.
The first thing that demands no
tice is the assertion that our nation
al legislature is to-day "utterly void
of conscience." This is a shocking
denuncistion against a legislature
composed largely of the men who
legislated for us during our terrible
war, and who since devised our
constitutional amendments so as to
mako the best national constitution
In the world one that liberated
four millions of .slaves, aud gave
them civil equality. By tho enact
menta of our natloual legislature
since the commencement of the war
up to the present day, it can be
proved that no other national legis
lature ever did so much in so short
time for the elevation of the poor
and the protection of the lower
classes of society. With a singl
exception tho legislation has been
so good as fallable men can make
up to tbe present day. Yet, Mr
Norton says "Oor public conscience
Is more debauched, and our civil
servico incomparably worse than
that of any other nation in Christ
endom." So Mr. Norton believes
but where is the evidence that his
belief is well founded ? The nations
of Christendom are numerous, and
therefore there may be some cases
that Mr. Norton has not iuvestigat
ed which may be worse than ours,
2d. Mr. Norton says, "In tbe pub-
lio life of the nation there is not one
great statesman left. Snmner was
such a man, and he was the last."
What an unfortuuale natiou we
are II Our last great statesman is
doad! In forty ot millions
of people there is not one
srreat statesman in public life I
Sumner was a man for whom
once had great respect and deep
sympathy, lie advocated a good
cause when it cost him much to do
so; but he wss too much of an ex
tremlst to succeed well in advocat
ing anv cause, lie was taiented
and eloquent, but lacked the pru
dence neceasary to bis being a great
atateaman. His speech sgainst Pres
ident Grant proved him to be a very
vicious man and one who had no
regard for truth. There was in it
tissue of palpable falsehoods, which
he must have known to be such
Since I read that speech, I have had
no respect for Sumner. Any man
who Is educated, talented, eloquent
and prudent may become a great
statesman. And we havo thousands
of such, and a number of such are
in the uational legislature.
2d. That General Butler erred In
some instances, is true ; and it is al
so true that he served his country
nobly dnring the rebel war, and
was the first general who took
right ground in respect to the
slaves. He did much more for his
country than Sumner, whom Mr,
Norton eulogizes as the "last great
statesman."
If all the minister in the Uuited
States were to teach as Mr. Norton
has done in the extrsct here present
ed, they would loose the bands of
government, and place us in the
condition of the South American
governments.
mat a oooy sa large as our
natloual legislature, selected by
common vote, will be ail honest, is
not to be expected. Some bad and
designing men will be elected. And
that there has been some eases of
bribery, is admitted ; but notwith
standing these exceptions, our gov
ernment has been well administered
under the presidency of general
Grant up to the present day.

Yesterday was a fine day for the
'atrona and their friends at and
around Cedar Point; old and
young, grave and gay, bad all
things common in a good dinner,
gotten dd bv the good ladies of
Cottonwood, Cedar and the Point.
We rather like snch gatherings.
They create a feeling of kindness, so
ciability and benevolence, and while
we enjoyed tbe festivities of the day
those of our fellows that have,
through the calamities of the past
season, been less fortunate, were not
netrlected. Arrangements were set
on foot to look after the needy.
Dr. Mead of the Point presided,
and at the opening of the meeting
read a good essay on the objects of
the order.
Col. 8. N. Wood, of the Falls,
gave us a good address. Mr. Mor

ns and, although he could not be
prevailed upon to give us a talk, be
did us the kindness to act as secre
tary. Miss E. V. Doughty, of the
Point, read a very good essay on
juvenile culture, which was well
recieved.
Mr. Cunningham also spoke in
regard to the interest, of the order,
Mr. Cunningham, his wife, and Mr,

In The Nkws of the 27th ult.,
am made to say that there had not
been a death in this county for the
last two years. This is either
mistake of the printer or of my
self. I think I wrote country not
county.
Cedar Is a uice creek of about 1C
miles in length, emptying into the
Cottowood river a mile east of the

about sixty-five or seventy families,

There will be some aid required
ror tne counties or I rego, Hodge

turns are too indefinite on which
to base an estimate.
At least 50 per cent, should be
added for clothing and bedding,
making 18,134 requiring assistance
for other than rations.
As you are aware, the war de

in most oi me loregoing coun
ties wneai was raised, but was
most unevenly distributed.
Homesteaders depended largely
upon tne corn crop and vegeta
bles, which were destroyed. The
failure of corn, the principal food
for domestic animals in the state,
has necessitated the feeding of
wheat; in addition to this there
has been a large increase in the
acreage of winter wheat sown this
fall. These two causes have di
miuished the supply of breadstuns,
and lessened the ability of those
counties to provide for their own
unfortunate.
There are individual cases of
destitution in isolated localities in
other parts of the state (of which
I make no estimate), and the
county commissioners and other
citizens are resolute in the en
deavor to not only provide for
their unfortunate, but- to contrib
ute to tne destitute on the fron
tier. While thev mav be able to
tase care of themselves, it is be
Ileved that thev will be, ia the
majority of cases, unequal to the
emergency of supplying the fron
tier.
Destitution is greater than has
been supposed. Our people axe
not beggars, and there have been
many cases of suffering discovered
wnere delicacy has hidden it from
public view as long as possible.
An important consideration
seems to have been overlooked.
Farmers are compelled to feed
wheat to work animals. Bad re
sults are already apparent in
many localities. It ia unnatural
food for work animals, and unless
corn can be provided for spring
work, at least in part, there will
not only be disease and sufferinsr
among stock, but farm industries
will be regarded.

Walls.
The troops have suffered some
for want of clothing. If the for
age gets up, Miles will move on
or about the tenth, along the
head-waters of the creeks empty
ing into the north fork of Red
river, to the head waters of the
main Red river, meeting there the
Eighth cavalry, who are ordered
to move fifty miles up the Cana
dian; thence south to meet his
command.
It is generally believed that the
Indians, who are still out, have
taken refuge in ravines near the
headwaters of the Red river. If
Miles had forage he would otart
to-day. The horses and mules are
thin in flesh, but otherwise in fair
condition.
