- . THE PERMANENT PACTFICi-TION
Of the country by the complete pro
tection or all citizens in every civi
and political right continues to be
of paramount interest with the great
body of our people. Every step in
this direction is welcomed with pub
lic approval, and every interruption
of steady and uniform progress to
the desired? consummation awaken3
general uneaine83 -and excites
speedy condemnation. The receat
Congressional elections have far-
nished a direct trnst worthy teat of
the advance thus far made In. the
practical establishment of ihe right
of suffrage secured by the Constitu
tion to the liberated race in the
Southern States. All disturbing in
fluences, real or imaginary, had been
removed from all of these States.
The three constitutional amendments
which conferred freedom and equali-
question will pot stay settled. If

To fho Editor ot the Morri tora Gaze'tte : ant perpetuity Of the Union, at SUCh
I have noticed recently in the pub- COst of treasure and life as a wise
lie print the name of lion. H. P and ".neoessary embodiment an the
Fowlkes, of Franklin, mentioned in organic law aad as oce of the just
connection with this Sn-eakership of rcsuits of the war. The people of

young- lawyer of conceded ability
and fins education, with Ihe requis

liamentary practice to qnalify Mm
for the discharge "of the wise and
difficult duties of the speakership.
He graduated at Princeton College
in 18C8, with.the first honors of his
class. After leaving college he be
gan the study of law and wa soon
admitted to practice. In 1870, he
was elected clerk of the Circuit court
oF U5arpson county, for the ensu
ing period of four years. At the
expiration of his term he declined to
run again, and resumed the practice
of law, which he has since prosecu
tedwiih,, success in. Williamson and
adjoining ceahtles.' lie was recent

'in the two 'counties. Ili's handsome
roajori?y, in a voting population of
about 13,000, is an evidence of his
high standing and popularity at
home.
If honesty ability and competen

tion, those who know Mr. Fowlkes,
will not hesitate to indorse him, as
well qualiGed to make an able and
efficient Speaker of the House. And
if East TeDBessee members have no
special choice of their own froji this
end of the State, and will take for it
the word of one, 'win? knows whereof
he writes, they can make no better
selection of a presiding officer west
of the mountains, than the subject
of this npice. II. G. Iv.
RoG'rcivrxLE, TejsN.,No:v. 29, '78
The above letter was written and
handedjtqTus by a gentleman who is
well acquainted with Mr. Fowlkes,
and to please our friend, if for no
oer, reason, we would be gratified
to hear that the talented young gen
tlemari .froia Williamson had been
selected to preside over the next
House. The young Democracy of
the State should be encouraged in
i - -
eTOr-'way possible, because upon
them must soon devolve the welfare
of the country. We are for putting
our young-men forward as fast as
possible. - ; : -
"Local optictm'' is beginning to
excite a good deal of interest In the
State of Tennessee just now. The
ujeaningof the term "local option"
is that the Legislature shall pass an
act permitting the qualified voters
of a civil district to say at the ballot
box whether intoxicating liquors
shall be sold within the district or
not. Such an act was passed in this
State- while Hon. John C. Brown was
Governor, and he vetoed it on the
ground of its unconstitutionality.
If another law similar to that one
skouid be enacted by the incoming
General Assembly it will be apt to
ireet the same fate at the hands of
Governor Marks, We doubt wheth-
the thirteenth, fourteenth and fif
teenth amendments, and law passed
in pursuance thereof!, should,! in good
faith, be enforced rigidly and impar
tailly, in letter and spirit, to the end,
that the humblest citizen, without
distinction of race or color, should,
under them,
RECEIVE FULL AND ElUAL TEOTEC
TION in person and property, and in polit
ical rights and privileges. By, these
constitutional amendments the
Southern States of the Union ob
tained a large increase of political
power in Cougress and in the Elec
toral College, and the country justly
expected that elections would pro
ceed, as to the enfranchised race,
upon the same circumstances of le
gal and constitutional freedom and
protection which were , obtained in
all the-other btates of the Union
The friends of law and order looked
forward to the conduct of these elec
tions as offering ty the general jud
ment of the country an important
opportunity to measure the degree
in which the right of suffrage could
be exercised by colored people, and
would be respected by. their fellow-
citizens, but a more general enjoy
ment of the freedom of suffrage by
the colored people, and a more just
and generous protection of that free
dom by communities, of which they
form a part, were generally anticipa
ted than the record of elections dis
closes. In some of those States in
which colored people have been un
able to make their opinions felt in
elections, the result is mainly due to
influences not easily measured or
remedied by legal protection; but
in the State of Louisiana and South
Carolina at large, and in some par
ticular Congressional Districts out
6ide of those States, the records of
electjpns seem to compel the conclu
sion that the . -
KIQIITS OF COLORED VOTEKS HAVE
