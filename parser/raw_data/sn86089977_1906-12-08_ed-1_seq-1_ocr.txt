MESSENGER fATALLV WOUNDED
Texarkana Tex Dec 3 Train rob
bers Saturday night looted the express
safe on Cotton Belt passenger train
No 4 northbound probably fatally
wounded Express Messenger Grissette
threw his body from the train and es
caped without other members of the
train crew knowing anything of the
robbery The robbers operated be
tween Redwater Texas and this city
a distance of thirteen miles and the
crime was not discovered until the
train was within three miles of Texar
kana The porter found the messen
ger missing the safe broken open and
the car in great disorder Splotches
of blood were on the safe and the
floor of the car where the body of the
messenger had lain No report of the
amount the robbers secured has been
obtainable as yet
The Identity of the robbers is still
a mystery Bloodhounds reached
here from Camden Arlt at 4 oclock
Sunday morning and were taken at
once to the scene of the robbery but
failed to take a trail A stranger who
has been here but a short time was
arrested on suspicion hut was later
leased The officers are working hard
on several clews but so far nothing
tangible seems to have developed
A telegram was received here from
Camden Ark seventy miles north
saying that two men had been arrested
and taken from the unlucky Cotton
Belt on its arrival there and would be
held for further developments
Grissette regained consciousness but
a minute at noon During that lucid
Interval he stated that there were two
of the robbers and that he knew one
of them but before he could give
names or other details he again laps
ed Into unconsciousness in which con
dition he now remains The hospital
surgeons say there Is practically no
hope for his recovery
CONGRESS ASSEMBLES
Washington Dec 3 Both Houses
of Congress met at 12 oclock today
but no business will be transacted on
the first day and comparatively little
during the first week
The proceedings in both houses to
day were of the most formal charac
ter These consisted of the business
of appointing committees by each body
to notify the other and both to notify
the President and by the House for
the call of the roll and the adminis
tration of the oath to all new mem
bers
Attention of tie members of the
House was directed to the fact that
four members of that body Messrs
Hltt Hoar Keatcham and Adams
have died since the close of the last
session and a motion for adjournment
out of respect to their memory imme
diately followed
The Presidents message will be re
ceived tomorrow and both houses will
probably adjourn for the day as soon
as it is read It is expected that the
nomination of Attorney General Moody
to succeed Justice Brown will be the
first of the nominations to be sent by
the President and there will be an ef
fort to secure Its immediate adoption
TULSA WANTS STORAGE
FOR HER WASTING OIL
Tulsa L T December 2 The de
velopments of the past few days Ja
the Glenn oil pools have put the oil
men in a fever of excitement which
reaches from the driver who hauls the
pipe and material to the fields to the
large capitalists of the Eastern cities
who are Tteeplng the wires hot asking
for information about new strikes anJ
pipe line rumors Big wells are com
ing In so fast that the pl men can
hardly distinguish one big strike from
another Wells of five hundred bar
rels a day are common and many are
reported as doing from one to two
thousand and a few as high as twenty
five thousand barrels a day
The production of the field can not
anywhere near be taken care of with
thousand of mechanics rushing up
tankage as fast as the material can be
delivered on the ground Storage for
millions of barrels of oil has been com
pleted and as much more Is under
construction yet the cry Is for a place
to put oil
The pipe line proposition is being
discussed by the oil men and there Is
a certainty of one pipe line If not two
from the Glenn pools to the Texas re
fineries With two pipe lines It will
give an outlet to the vast volume of cl
to the markets of the world and make
Eastern capitalists anxious to get in
to the field and get a hold of the best
producing wells
Some of the wells have sold for
50000 each and some forty acre sec
tions have sold for 300000 Most of
the land was formerly owned by the
Creek Indians and many a little five

WANT AN INCREASE
Congressmen Want 7500 but Dasnt
Ask It
Washington Dec 1 The desire to
increase the wages of statesmen and
their helpers is again agitating the
breasts of Congressmen particularly
those who labor in the House end of
the Capitol It Is rather likely that
Congress will have an opportunity to
advance the wages of the helpers
that Is private secretaries since the
subcommittee that is preparing the
legislative executive and judicial ap
propriation bill has agreed to provide
a compensation of 125 a month in
stead of 100 which is now the salary
but whether Congress will have the
proposition to increase the pay of its
own members put up to it is more
doubtful The same subcommittee is
considering the advisability of adding
2500 which would make the salary
of a Congressman 7500 a year but
as yetit has come to no resolution
The general opinion Is however
that there is not any probability that
Congress at this time will have the
courage of Its convictions The or
dinary member will not hazard 5000
to win 7500 so the statesmen will
continue to read the advances given
to other laborers with mixed emotion
and envy

test between Montgomery Ward

ion Finally the teamsters struck in
sympathy with the garment workers
At first this strike was against Mont
gomery Ward Co alone It spread
until the citys entire business was
tied up Young says the first bribery
was of the teamsters leaders by the
garment workers to call the initial
strike Later he asserts Shea re
ceived considerable sums from other
firms for the privilege of continuing
the teaming work despite the tieup
His story today was of the meeting
with the garment workers represent
atives
Shea myself James Barry Hugh
McGee and Jeremiah McCarthy all of
ficers of the teamsters met Robert
Noreen of the garment wprkers in a
saloon In the Stock Exchange build
ing he said and Noreen gave us
1500 to strike against Montgomery
Ward Co We divided the momy
and then each of us gave 20 back to
Noreen for his trouble The next day
the strike was called In disregard of
the union rules and of the antiboycott
laws
Shea had already told the Chicago
Federation of Labor officials that ne
could find the men for a sympathetic
strike if they would furnish the mon

in brief Is the forecast for the short
iession of the Fiftyninth congress
It Is evident that for various reasons
It will not be possible tc do much
on the appropriation bills before the
holidays and this circumstance will
practically have the effect of con
densing the consideration of the 14
large supply measures Into two
months Considering that the aggre
gate of the appropriations to be will
approximate one billion dollars some
senators and members express tha
opinion that congress cannot do bet
ter than give all of its time to these
measures
The Ship Subsidy Bill
The ship subsidy bill probably will
be an exception to the rule for no
general legislation The friends of
that measure have never been mora
insistent than now They are extreme
ly hopeful and yet very apprehensive
The bill has passed the senate and
is in committee In the house The
committee has heretofore ben quite
evenly divided but the advocats of
the bill believe that they will be able
to get it out in due seasrn and they
hope for its consideration when onca
reported to the house One incident
that is very materially helping tha
subsidy is the recent speech of Secre
tary Root In support of It

lievers in the necessity almost despair
of arcompll hinr rn thins n that di
rection durljg a siort sesslan Tha
recommendations of tho presidnt in
the Interest of a national inheritance
tax Is awaited with eager Interest by
many and there is no doubt that a
large following could be secured for a
measure of the character he will out
line
The Tariff and Other Questions
Among the questions slated for a
liberal share of discussion the tariff
stands at the head ot the list but no
one has the least idea that any seri
ous effort will now be made to secure
the modifications which even many
republicans think desirable The pres
ident who himself desires soma
changes has recently promised his
congressional callers that he will not
ask to have the subject taken up at
this time The Japanese question the
discharge of the negro soldiers tha
desirability of an Income tax law the
result of the late elections and tha

Senator Smoots Case

position to put the Smoot matter
aside but with the report of the com
mittee on privileges and elections on
the calendar and Chairman Burrow3
quite determined to press considera
tion the fact that the matter must ua
dealt with is beginning to Impress
itself upon members and they are
preparing seriously for it3 considera
tion The Michigan senator will set
the ball rolling Monday the 10th Inst
The Panama Canal
Much interest attaches to the presi
dents forthcoming recommnndatlons
concerning the Panama canal espe
cially because or his recent visit to
the canal zone It is not expected

yond the necessary appropriations
and there is a general dispositlcn to
grant these The increase of the
navy will receive much consideration
but there is still opposition to the
proposed ship of the Dreadnaught
class
