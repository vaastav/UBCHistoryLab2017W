THE WENATCHEE DAILY WORLD, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1910.
PRESIDENT TAFT SOW
MESSAGE 10 MBS
(Continued from rage One)
entire commercial world, arfd hence
the minimum tariff of the United
States has been given universal ap
satisfactory character of our trade
relations with foreign countries.
Marked advantages to the com
merce of the United States were ob
tained through these tariffs. For
eign nations are fully cognizant of
the fact that under section two of
the tariff act the president is required
whenever he is satisfied that the
treatment accorded by them to the
products of the United States is not
such as to entitle them to the bene
fits of the minimum tariff of the
United States, to withdraw these
| benefits by proclamation, after 90
j days' notice, after which the maxi
! mum tariff will apply to their duti-
I able products entering the United
; States. In its general operation the
; section of the tariff law has thus far
provided a guaranty of continued
! commercial peace, although there
i are, however, unfortunately, in
stances where foreign governments
deal arbitrarily with American in
terests within their jurisdiction in a
manner injurious and inequitable.
Tho policy of broader and closer
| relations with the Dominion of Can
j ada which was initiated in the ad
justment of the maximum and mini
! mum provisions of the tariff act of
August. 1909. has proved mutually
I beneficial. It justifies further ef
forts for the readjustment of the
, commercial relations of the two
countries so that their commerce
j may follow the ' channels natural to
< contiguous countries and be com
.•! mensurate with the steady expansion
!of trade and industry on both sides
!of the boundary line. The recipro
-1 cation on the part of the dominion
[of the sentiment which was express
ed by this government was followed
jin October by the suggestion that it
j would be glad to have the negotia
l tions, which had been temporarily
1 suspended, during the summer, re
! sumed. In accordance with this
; suggestion, the secretary of state, by
jmy direction, despatched two repre
i sentatives of the department of state
ias special commissioners to Ottawa
Ito confer with representatives of the
dominion government.
Conferences were held by these
commissioners, with officials of the
dominion government at Ottawa in
the early part of Novemeber.
The conferences were adjourned to
be resumed in Washington in Jan
uary, when it is hoped the aspira
tions of both governments for mv
i tually advantageous measures of re
! ciprocity will be realized.
Cost of Running the Government.
The final estimate for the year
ending June 30. 1912, as they have
been sent to the treasury, on Nov.
23 of this year, for the ordinary ex
penses of the government, including
those for public buildings, rivers and
harbors, and the navy building pro
gram, amount to $630,49 4,013. This
is $52.9g4,N57 less than the appro
priations for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1911. It is $18,883,153
less than the total estimates, includ
ing supplemental estimates submit
ted to congress by the treasury fbt
the year 1911, and is $5,574,659
less than the original estimates sub
mitted by the treasury of 1911.
These figures do not include the
appropriations for the Panama canal,
the policy in respect to which ought
to be, and is, to spend as much
each year as can be economically
and effectively expended in order to
complete the canal as promptly as
possible and, therefore, the ordi
nary motive for cutting down the
expense of the government does not
apply to appropriations for this pur
pose. The estimates for the Panama
canal for the ensuing year are more
than fifty-six millions of dollars, an
increase of twenty millions over the
amount appropriated for this year—
a difference due to the fact that the
estimates for 1912 include some
thing over $19,000,000 for the for
tification of the canal. Against the
estimated expenditures of $630.
494,013 the treasury has estimated
receipts for next year $880,000,000.
making a probable surplus of $50,
000,000, or. taking into account the
estimates for the Panama canal,
which are $56,920,847, and which ul
timately will be paid in bonds, it
will leave a deficit for the next year
of about, $7,000,000, if congress
shall conclude to fortify the canal.
The cost of the fortifications is
about nineteen millions of dollars.
Should there be no appropriations
this year Tor fortifications, then
there would be, even including the
Panama canal appropriation, a sur
plus of about twelve millions, ac
cording to the treasury estimates.
Public Buildings
In our public buildings we still
suffer from the method of appropri
ation which has been so much criti
cised in connection with our rivers
and harbors. Some method should
be devised for controlling the sup
ply of public buildings, so that they
will harmonize with the actual needs
of the government. Not only are
buildings appropriated for by con
gress which are not needed, and
buildings left unappropriated for by
congress which are needed, but
when it comes to the actual construc
tion there has been in the past too
little study of the building plans and
streets with a review to actual neeJs
of government. Postoffice buildings
which are in effect warehouses for
the economical handling of 'trans
portation of thousands of tons of
mails have been made monumental
structures, and often located far
from the convenient and economical
spot. In the actual construction of
the buildings a closer scrutiny of the
methods employed by the govern
ment architects or by architects em
ployed by the government, have re
sulted in decided economies. It is
hoped that more time will give op
portunity for a more thorough or
ganization. The last public build
ing bill carried authorization for the
ultimate expenditure of $33,011,500
and I approved because of the many
good features it contained, just as I
approved the river and harbor bill,
but it was drawn upon a principle
that ought to be abandoned. It seems
to me that the wiser methods of pre
paring a public building bill would
be the preparation of a report by a
commission of government experts,
whose duty it should be to report to
congress the government neds in the
way of the construction of public
buildings in every part of the country
just as the army enginers make re
port, with reference to the utility of
proposed improvements in rivers and
harbors, with the added functions
which I have recommended for the
recommendations the relative im
portance of the various projects
found to be worthy of approval and
execution.
The Payne Tariff Act
The schedules of the rates of duty
in the Payne tariff act have been
subjected to a great deal of criticism
some of it just, more of it unjust,
and too much misrepresentation.
The act was adopted in pursuance of
a declaration of the party which is
responsible for it, that a customs
bill should be a tariff for the pro
tection of home industries, the mea
sure of the protection to be the dif
ference between the cost of produc
ing the imported article from abroad
and the cost of producing it at home,
together with such addition to that
difference as might give a reason
able profit to the home producer. The
basis for the criticism of this tariff
is that in respect to a number of
the schedules the declared measure
was not followed, but a higher dif
ference retained or inserted by way
of undue discrimination in favor of
certain industries and manufactur
ers. Little, if any, of the criticism
of the tariff has been directed against
trie protective principle above stated;
but the main body of the criticism
has been based on the charge that
the attempt to conform to the mea
sure of protection was not honestly
and sincerely adhered to.
Tariff Board
The time in which the tariff was
prepared undoubtedly was so short
as to make it impossible for the con
gress and its experts to acquire the
information necessary to conform

strictly to the declared measure. In
order to avoid criticism of this kind,
in the future, and for the purpose ot
more nearly conforming to the party
promise, congress at its last session
made provision, at my request, for
the continuance of a board created
under the authority of the maximum
and minimum clause of the tariff bill
and authorized the board to expend
the money appropriated tinder my di
rection for the ascertainment of the
cost of production at home and
abroad of the various articles in
cluded in the schedules of the tariff.
The tariff board thus appointed and
authorized has been diligent in pre
paring itself for the necessary in
vestigation. The hope of those who
have advocated the uae>of this board
for tariff purposes is that the rate of
duty imposed shall become more of
a business question and less of a po
litical question, to be ascertained by
experts of long training and accurate
knowledge. The halt in business
and in the shock to business, due to
the announcement that a new tariff
bill is to be prepared and put in op
eration will be avoided by treating
the schedules one by one, as occa
sion shall arise, for a change in the
rates of each, and only after a re
port upon the schedule by the tariff
board competent to make the report
It is not likely that the board will be
able to make a report during the
present session of congress upon any
of the schedules, because a proper
examination involves an enormous
amount of detail and a great deal of
care; but I hope to be able, at the
opening of the new congress, or at
least during the session of that con
gress, to bring to its attention the
facts in regard to these schedules in
the present tariff that may prove to
need amendment. The carrying out
of this plan, of course, involves the
full cooperation of congress in limit
ing the consideration in tariff mat
ters to one schedule at a time, be
cause if the proposed amendment to
a tariff bill is to involve a complete
consideration of all the schedules
and another revision, then we shall
only repeat the evil from which the
business of this country has, in time
past, suffered most grievously by
stagnation and uncertainty, pending
a resettlement of a law affecting all
business directly, and the effect of
which no wise business man would
ignore in new projects and invest
ments. I can not too much empha
sise the importance and benefit of
the plan above proposed for the
treatment of the tariff. It facilitates
the removal of noteworthy defects
in an important law without distur
bance of business prosperity, which
is even more important to the hap
piness and the comfort of the people
than the elimination of instances of
injustice in the tariff.
The inquiries which members of
the tariff board made during the last
summer into the methods pursued by
other governments with reference to
the fixing of tariffs and the determi
nation of their effect upon trade,
show that each government main
tains an office or bureau, the officers
and employes of which have made
their life work the study of tariff
