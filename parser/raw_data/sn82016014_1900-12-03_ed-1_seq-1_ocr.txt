"Washington, Dec. 3. The opening1 of
congress today drew great crowds to the
capitol intent on witnessing those in
teresting scenes marking the inaugura
tion of the legislative work of tlje gov
ernment. On June 7 last the first ses
sion of the Fifty-sixth congress adjourn
ed and the second session began today
with many momentous questions await
ing the attention, of the national law
makers. Early in the day the tide of travel
turned down Pennsylvania avenue
toward the capitol, filling the broad
walks leading to the Marble Terrace,
which by 11 o'clock presented a scene
of busy activity. On the eastern plaza
front there was the same scene of activ
ity, long lines of carriages swinging up
to the wings, bringing senators, mem
bers, public officials and interested ob
servers, while the many lines of cars
contributed their quota of the interested
public
Inside the building but little restric
tion had been placed on the free mov
ing of the throng and the crowd moved
at will from one wing to the other. All
of the public galleries were open so that
every one in the good natured crowds
had an equal chance.
l-y 11 o clock the elevators began to
be besieged and there were signs of an
overflow at the doors leading to the gal
leries. It was evident that the ladies
took great interest in the procedure;
for they were present in full once, jne
delegation of girl students numbering
over 50.
There were conferences among sen
ator's as to the programme for the week
and for so eariy in tbe session, unusual
act'.vity was displayed by members on
both sides of the capitol.
Speaker Henderson arrived at his
private office about 11:15 and soon was
surrounded by members, discussing the
programme of business. On the senate
Kide there was less evidence of activity,
and the crowds were rather slow in in
vading the galleries. Tne president pro
tern. Mr. Frye, was at his office early,
conferring with senators and by 11:30
the floor of the senate began to show
signs of the activity preceding actual
business.
At noon the two houses of congress
were called to order for the second ses
sion of the Fifty-sixth congress.
SENATE.

of Wm. K. Dillingham, as a senator

Iowa, was present, but his credentials
were withheld until the official an
nouncement of Senator Gear's death.
At 12:15 p. m. the senate took a recess
for half an hour. The president pro
tern, Mr. Frye, appointed Messrs. Cock-
rell and Hoar a committee to wait on
the president and inform him that the
senate was ready to receive any com
munication he desired to make.
At 12: So the senate took a. further re

of New York. Grosvenor of Ohio and
Richardson of Tennessee, to join the

Canteen.
"Washington. Dec. 3. Swrctjirv Root's
bill for the reorganization nf thi armv i

once referred to that committee. Work
on the biil has been in progress and the

probably wUl be madii tomorrow and
Chairman Hull says he hopes to begin
consideration cf the measure within a
day or two certainly by Friday, with the
expectation of passing it in the house
before the close of the present week. Mr
Hull says the requirements of the mi'
itary service make it essential to pass
the measure without delay. One of the
changes in the bill made by the commit

amendment offered by Mr. Hay (Va.)
prohibiting the sale of liquor on milita'-y
property, transports, etc.

Goyernor Writes a Letter
the Representatives.
to
Urges That the Republicans
Make a Record.
Governor Stanley has declared against
legislative extravagance and against
the employment of useless clerks and
other unnecessary expenditures.
The governor has taken this subject
fo the members of the forthcoming leg
islature by personal letters. Among the
first to reach the members-elect were
those mailed to Shawnee county's legis
lators. Senator John T. Chaney was
first in this list, receiving today the
governor's communication which fol
lows: "The legislature soon to meet will be
Republican in both .branches the first
time in twelve years. The last Republi
can legislature was in 1SS9. The next
will be in 1601.
"The legislature which met in 1SS9
was composed of 40 senators and 141
members and delegates of the house,
making a total of 1S1 members. That
legislature had in its service 170 em
ployes, and the total expense of the
session was $62,532.60.
"The' last legislature had 16 fewer
members and S6 more employes the
total number of employes being 2c6.
The total expense of members and em
ployes in 1SS9 was $62,532.60; in 1899,
$79,605.17, although there were 16 fewer
members of the legislature.
"It is hardly necessary to say that
this increase of more than $17,000 in the
expense of the legislature of 1899 over
that of 1&S9 was wholly unnecessary,
and was made up largely in paying
clerks and other alleged employes whose
names appeared upon the pay roll, but
who never performed any actual ser
vices for the state or for the legislature.
The abuse of rinding places for favorites
with nothing to do, caused this large
increase in expenditure of more than 27
per cent, and provoked considerable dis
cussion and criticism. Since 1SS9, critic
ism has largely been disarmed by the
fact that the house and senate have,
generally, been of opposite political par
ties, and one was as much to blame for
this added expense as tne otner.
"The next legislature will be Republl
ran in both branches, and the Republi
can party will be compelled to meet the
entire responsibility tor tne expense in
cident to such session. It is of the ut
most importance that the members of
the legislature exercise tne greatest
caution in avoiding those things that
will be the subject of just criticism.
"At the commencement of the present
administration? the tax levy was in
creased. Two things seemed to render
this imperative: The preceding admin
istration had left a large deficiency of
more than $400,000. This had to be met.
A large levy was necessary to erect
buildings at nearly all of the public in
stitutions. The sum necessary for that
purpose amounted to more than half a
million of dollars. This large sum was
wisely expended, and the people approved
the action of the legislature in making
that appropriation.
"Some extraordinary appropriations
will be asked at the coming session of
the legislature. An attempt will be
made to secure an appropriation to en
able Kansas to make an exhibit at the
Pan-American exposition, to be held at
Buffalo, N. Y. An appropriation will al
so be asked for the Semi-Centennial ex
hibition at Topeka in 1904. I trust that
before coming to Topeka, you will talk
with your people and get the sentiment
of your community as to these appropri
ations: ""First "Whether they feel it wise to
make an appropriation for the purpose
of enabling this state to make an exhib
it at Buffalo.
"Second Whether they are in favor of
an appropriation for the Semi-Centennial
Exhibition here.
"I am satisfied that the members of
the legislature will come here prompted
by an honest desire to do the right
thing, and that the Republican members
will attempt to prevent such extrava
gance as would be the subject of critic
ism. I believe the state can afford to
make liberal appropriations for thosi?
enterprises that will be of benefit to the
state, but can not afford to make appro
priations to schemes or enterprises that
will not do the state any good.
"I have no suggestions to make other
than as indicated above that you will
ascertain before coming here the real
sentiment of your people upon these
questions, that your actions may be in
perfect accord with the desires of thr"
people you repreesnt. I have great faith
in the people, and if we conform to their
wishes and use our best efforts for th.i
betterment of the public service, I be
lieve that the Republican party will be
secure in the confidence of the people for
years to come."

ASSEMBLE AT CHURCH.
Ceremony Is Performed by the
Parish Priest.
All But Five Hundred of Them
Were Eolomen.
Manila, Dec 3. Sunday in Vigan was
a great day for the American cause.
Twenty-two hundred natives of the re
gion, nearly all fighting rebels, crowded
the church and took the oath of alle
giance to the United States. The oath
was administered by the priest. All but
500 of those sworn were bolo men. The
number included the twelve hundred
bolo men who had previously surrend-
erea.
The proceedings in the church occu
pied the entire day and- included an ad
dress by General Young and an exhor
tation by the priest.
Scarcely any rebels remain in the vi
cinity of" Santa Maria. General Young
attributes this fact to three causes: the
re-election of President McKinley, the
arrival of a stronger body of troops, and
the especially rigid enforcement of war
measures, and the deportation of prison
ers to Manila. He reports that it is
necessary to occupy all the barriers in
order to protect the natives from the
vengeance of Tagalog raiders.
ENDORSED BY TEACHERS.
Southwestern Association Adopts
Semi-Centennial Resolutions.
That the teachers of southwestern
Kansas are heartily in favor of the
Kansas Semi-Centennial Exposition is
evidenced by the fact that at a meeting
of the association in Wichita Saturday
they adopted resolutions strongly fav
oring the project.
The resolutions were to the effect that
in their opinion three hundred thousand
dollars was not too large a sum to ask
of the legislature which meets in this
city in January, and strongly urged the
governor of the state. W. K. Stanley, to
recommend to the legislature the appro
priation of that amount. ,
following are the resolutions:
"Resolved, That it is the sense of this
convention that the celebration of the
semi-centennial of Kansas in 1904 has
our hearty endorsement. We fully rec
ognize that it means a great deal to the
future development, progress and ad
vancement of western Kansas, and we
respectfully request that Governor W.
E. Stanley in his message to the incom
ing legislature would recommend a very
generous appropriation, not less than
three hundred thousand dollars, for the
semi-centennial celebration of Kansas.
'Resolved, That a copy of this reso
lution be forwarded to Governor Stan
ley at once by the secretary of this as
sociation, duly signed."
There were fully 200 teachers present,
and all were enthusiastic in their con
currence to the resolutions.

There are three young women waiting
in the women's department of the city

they have all been sent here from other
Kansas towns.
The home is expected to open this
week, and everything is in readiness,
but the matron, whose home is in Chi

BOERS AREWELCOUE.
Plenty of Land in America For Them
to Acquire Cheaply.
New York, Dec 3. A special to the
World from Washington says:
Representative Lacey of Iowa, chair
man of the committee on public lands,
said in an interview regarding the com
ing to America of Boer families:
"If the Boers want to come to America
they will be able to find plenty of land.
"While a greater part of the most desir
able land has already been pre-empted,
there remains enough to furnish home
steads for all the families who come.
"I believe the state nt Texas would of
fer greater inducements to the Boers
than any other place. It is true there
are no public lands in Texas. When that
state entered the Union it reserved all its
lands, and they are now known as school
lands.
"These can be bought for from $1.25 to
$2 an acre, with five years to pay it in.
There will be several million acres of
good land in Oklahoma opened for set
tlement in the spring.
"There is a settlement in my community
which everybody is proud of. Two town
ships were brought up, and Hollanders
reside there. These people are among
the most industrious in the state.
"The Boers can find land anywhere in
the west Colorado, Montana, New Mex
ico almost any western state. They can
buy land there for very little, or settle
on the public domain and cultivate that
land.
"It is a noticeable thing that every
where Hollanders or Germans or people
o fthat character have settled, the price
of property immediately increases. They
are good neighbors, good citizens and
Vill be welcomed in any community."
Senator Teller of Colorado, said:
"The Boers would prove valuable citi
zens and would be gladly received in any
portion of the United States in which
they might settle. The most desirable
lands open for settlement under the
homestead act have already been taken.
If the Boers have money they can secure
good land for very little.
"I do not believe that they could set

would be worthless without it. I should

"A settlement of Boers would un
doubtedly receive every inducement to

They could buy land on long time pay

soon acquire a homestead."

A NOTE OF WARNING
Congress Is Urged to Guard
Against Extravagance.
Trust Matter Is Touched Light
ly in Passing.
Steamship Subsidy Measure Is
Distinctly Endorsed.
Washington, Dec. 3. The annual mes
sage of President McKinley, submitted
to congress, is as follows:
To the Senate and House of Represen
tatives: "With the outgoing of the old and the
incoming of the new century you begin
the last session of the Fifty-sixth con
gress with evidences on every hand of
individual and national prosperity and
with proof of the growing strength and
increasing power for good of republican
Institutions. Tour countrymen will Join
with you in felicitation that American
liberty is more firmly established than
ever before, and that love for it and the
determination to preserve It are more
universal than at any former period of
our history.
The republic was never e-o strong, be
cause never so strongly entrenched in
the hearts of the people as now. The
constitution with few amendments, ex
ists as- it left the hands of its authors.
The additions which have been made
to it proclaim larger freedom and more
extended citizenship. Popular govern
ment has demonstrated in its one hun
dred and twenty-four years of trial
here its stability and security, and its
efficiency as the best instrument of na
tional development and the best safe
guard to human rights.
A LOOK BACKWARD.
When the Sixth congress assembled
in November, 1800, the population of
the United States was 5,308.483. It is
now 78,304,799. Then we had sixteen
states. Now we have forty-five. Then
our territory consisted of 909,050 square
miles. It is now 3,846,595 square miles.
Education, religion and morality have
kept pace with our advancement in
other directions, and while extending its
power the government has adhered to
its foundation principles and abated
none of them in dealing with our new
peoples and possessions. A nation so
preserved and blessed gives reverent
thanks to God and invokes His guidance
and the continuance of His care and
favor.
In our foreign Intercourse the domi
nant question has been the treatment
of the Chinese problem. Apart from
this our relations with the powers have
been happy.
The recent troubles In China spring
from the anti-foreign agitation which
for the past three years has gained
streneth in the northern provinces.
Their origin lies deep in the character
of the Chinese races and in the tradi
tions of their government. The Taiping
rebellion and the opening of Chinese
ports to foreign trade and settlement
disturbed alike the homogeneity and the
seclusion of China.
Meanwhile foreign activity made It
self felt in all quarters, not alone on the
coast, but along the great river arteries
and in the remoter districts, carrying
new Ideas and introducing new associa
tions among a primitive people which
had pursued for centuries a national
policy of isolation.
The telegraph and the railway spread
ing over their land, the steamers ply
insr on their waterways, the merchant
and the missionary penetrating year by
year farther to the interior, became to
the Chinese mind types of an alien in
vasion, changing the course of their na
tional life and fraught with vague fore
bodings of disaster to their beliefs and
their self-control.
For several years before the present
troubles all the resources of for
eign diplomacy, backed by moral dem
onstrations or tne pnysicai lorce oi
fleets and arms, have been needed to
secure due respect ior tne treaty
risrht of foreigners and to obtain
satisfaction from the responsible author
ities for the sporadic outrages upon the
persons and property of unoffending ad-
journers, which from time to time oc
curred at widely separated points in the
northern provinces, as in the case of tiie
outbreaks in Sze-Chun and Shantung.
Posting of anti-foreign placards be
came a daily occurrence, which the re
peated reprobation of the imperial pow
er failed to check or punish. These in
flammatory appeals to the ignorance
and superstition of the masses, men
dacious and absurd in their accusations
and deeply hostile is their spirit, could
not but work cumulative harm. They
aimed at no particular class of foreign
ers; they were Impartial in attacking
everything foreign. An outbreak in
Shantung, in which German missionar
ies were slain, was the too natural re
sult of these malevolent teachings. The
posting of seditious placards, exhorting
the utter destruction of foreigners
and of every foreign thing, continued
unrebuked. Hostile demonstrations
toward the stranger gained strength by
organization.
The sect, commonly styled the boxers,
developed greatly in the provinces north
of the Tangtse, and with thei collusion
of many notable officials, including some
in the immediate councils of the throne
itself, became alarmingly aggressive. No
foreigners life, outside cl the protected
treaty ports, was faf. No foreign In
terest, a secure from (tpoiiutlon.
Th - matic representatives of th
po "ekin strove in vain to chck
thi.. ' i nt. Protest was followed I
deman,' r.& demand by renewnl protest,
to be met with perfunctory edicts from
the palace and evasive and futile assur
ances from the Tsung-LI-Yam'n. Th
circle of the boxer influence narrowed
about Pekin, and while nominally utii;
matized as seditious, it was Telt that lt
spirit pervaded the capital itself. th;it
the imperial forces were imbued with Its
doctrines, and that the Immediute coun
selors of the !mprrs9 dowager wre In
full sympathy with the anti-forelgu
movement.
The increasing gravity of the condi
tions in China and the Imminence of
pt'il to our own diversified Interests in
the empire, as well as to thost of all th
other treaty government!", were soon ap
preciated by this gov -rnnient, causing it
profound solicitude. Tho United St:it. .
from the earliest days nf fnrritrn inter
course with Chira had followed a policy
of peace, omitting no occasions to i'hU
fy good will, to iurther the extension "f
lawful trade, to respect the sovereign' v
of its government, and to insure by all
legitimate and kindly but earnest tnmm
the fullest measure of protection for tli.i
lives and property of our Inw-ahidlnc
citizens and for the exerc! of their
beneficent callings among the Chinese
people.
Mindful of this, it was flt tt be ap
propriate that our purpose should hi
pronounced In favor of fin h course nn
would hasten united action of thi pow
ers at Pckln to promote the admtnSst r:i -tive
reform bo grently n rdod f"r
strengthening the imperial go erninent
and maintaining the integrity of Chln.i,
in which we believed the whole western
world to be alike concerned. To thiw
ends I caused to be addressed to tf
several powers occupying terrltoty an I
maintaining siberes of Influence. In Chi
na the circular proposals of 1V!. Invit
ing from them declarations of their In
tentions and views as to the desirability
ot the adoption of measures insuring tut
tsnef.t of equality of treatment of M l
forrtgn trade throughout China.
With, gratifying unanimity th re
sponses coincided in this common policy,
enabling me to see in the or rssful ter
mination of these negol la lions proof of
the friendly wiirtt which animate 11m
various powers Interested In the un
trammeled development of corn men ej
and industry In the Chinese empire as a.
sourc of vast benefit to tha whole com
mercial world.
In this conclusion. Thieh I liarl tl
gratification to announce an completed
engagement to the intei.sted powers on
March 20, 1900, I hopefully discerned a
potenti.tl factor for the abatement of
the distrust of foreign purposes v.lili l

IM POTENCY" OF CHINA.
"l'he Chinese government proved,
hoyever, unable to cheek the rising
strength of the boxers and appeared !
be a prey to internal dissensions. In the,
unequal cortest the anti-foreign In
fluences soon gained the ascendancy un
der the leadcrniiip of Prince Tnan. r
gant?d armies of boxers, with whleli
the imperial fences affiliated, held thn
country between" Pekin and the const,
penetrated, into M-anchuria up to thei
Russian border. arl through their emis
saries threatening iZ- like rise, throughout!
northern China.
Attacks upon foreigners, destruction
of property, and slaughter of natlva
converts were reporte.t from all sides.
The Tsung-Ll-Yamen. already permeat
ed with. Hostile sympathitw. could mak
no effective response to V" appeal of
the legations. At this critical Juncture,
in the early spring of this year, a pro
posal was made by the ofier power
that a combined fleet be KWtnl.li'd im
Chinese waters as a moral .Vmonst ra
ti on, under cover of which to exact of
the Chinese government reKperV. for for
eign treaty rights and the sup Vcssioti
of the boxers.
The United States, while not Xirtlcw
pating in the Joint dernoiiBti "at Ion,
promptly sent from the Phlllpiprn'M utl
ships tiat could be spared for se,-vii
on the Chinese coast. A small force or
marines was landed at Taku ami sent
to Pekin for the protection of the Amer
ican legation. Other powers took sim
ilar action, until some four hundred men
were asso.mbled in the capital as lega
tion guards.
Still the peril Increased. The legation
reported the development of the sedi
tious movement in Pekin and the need
of increased provision for defence,
against it. While preparations were in
progress for a larger expedition, to
strengthen the legation guard and k-i
