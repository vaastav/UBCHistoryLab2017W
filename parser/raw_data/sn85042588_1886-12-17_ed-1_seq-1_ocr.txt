THE TARIFF IS3UK DISCUSSED.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18.—The senate re­
sumed consideration of Mr. Morrill's reso­
lution declaring the promise of making a
proper revision of the tariff at the present
session obviously hopeless and impractica­
ble, and Mr. Dawes proceeded to address
the senate on the subject The secretary
of the treasury, he said, had come into the
field and taken his advanced position on
the subject of the tariff, causing increased
apprehension in all the great industries of«
the land. Sober, conservative business
men and thoughtful, anxious, but clear­
headed dependents on these interests were
now seriously inquiring whether, oil the
whole, they might not be wrecked it' the
theories and doctrines announced in the
reports of the Kfccretary of the treasury
were to govern in the revision of the tariff.
He characterized the secretary's views as
wild, wanton and brutal.
Mr. McPherson said that there were but
two methods of disposing of the surplus
revenues—one of which was extravagance
in appropriations and the other was by a
reduction of taxation. As to himself, he
was in favor of the second.
Mr. Morrill moved the reference of his
resolution to the committee on finance.
Mr. Beck opposed its reference to tnat
committee. The resolution was therefore
laid over, and Mr. Hoar moved up the ten­
ure of office bill.
Mr. Piatt protested that the special order
as to open executiue sessions of the senate
should take precedence of any other mat­
ter. Pending consideration of Mr. Hoar's
bill, a message from the house was pre­
sented on the subject of tlie death of Rep­
resentative Dowduey, of New York. A
resolution was adopted for the appoint­
ment of a committee to attend the funeral,
and as a mark of respect the senate ad­
journed.
TO STOP IMMIGRATION.
WASHINGTON. Dec. 14.—Among the me­
morials presented was one by Mr. Spooner
from the German Aid society of Wisconsin,
expressing the idea that there was no fur­
ther necessity for the stimulation of immi­
gration to this country and that no satis­
factory reason can be assigned for allowing
foreigners to vote and hold office after one
year's residence and before they are natur­
alized, and suggesting the enactment of
laws making naturalization and suffrage
conform to a uniform standard. Referred.
On motion of Mr. Ingalls, the senate took
up the bill reported by him yesterday, di­
recting that none of the avenues, streets,
alleys or reservations of the city of Wash­
ington shall be occupied for other than or­
dinary purposes without the consent of
congress being first obtained. After con­
siderable debate, the bill was passed.
The senate then took up the bill repeal­
ing the tenure of office law and Mr. Ed­
munds took the floor in oppssition to the
bill. Mr. Hoar advocated the passage of
the bill. Pending discussion, the senate
adjourned.
CONSIDERING OPEN EXECUTIVE SESSIONS.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.—Mr. Piatt called
up his resolution, that executive nomina­
tions shall hereafter be considered in open
session, except when otherwise ordered by
a vote of the senate.
Mr. Morrill moved an amendment, by
striking out the words "executive nomina­
tions" and inserting in lieu thereof the
words "reciprocity treaties, so-called." Mr.
PJatt had no objection.
Mr. Hoar moved to lay the resolution on
the table. Agreed to—yeas, 88 nays, 21.
Mr. Culloui presented a report on the
inter-state commerce bill and asked that it
be printed, and suggested that lie would
next Monday ask the senate to take it up.
Mr. Beck called up the bill prohibiting
senators or represetatives from acting as
attorneys for subsidized railroad compa­
nies, the question being on the snbstitute
as reported from the judiciary committee.
Mr. Beck denounced it as indecent for sen­
ators to sit and vote upon measures affect­
ing great railroad companies, to the amount
of hundreds of millions, while having the
money of those companies in their pockets.
Without reaching a vote, the senate went
into executive session and when the doors
were reopened, adjourned.
TO REPEAL THE TKNUBK OF OFFICE ACT.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16.—Among the cal­
endar bills set back on objection was that
granting aright of way to the Cinnabar &
Clarks Fork Railroad company.
The bill to permit the owners of Ameri­
can vessels and their cargoes to sue the
government for losses caused by collision
with United States vessels, arising from
mismanagement was passed, the vote on
the third reading being 21 to 17.
The senate then took up the unfinished
business of yesterday, being a bill to re­
peal the tenure of office act. Mr. Edmund*
addressed the senate in opposition to the
bill. He argued that if executives of state
governments could not be trusted—as they
were not—with kingly power, it was still
more important that the national ex­
ecutives should not be trusted with such
power.
BISMARCK. DAKOTA. FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17. 1886
Mr. George made a constitutional and
historical argument in favor of the bill.
Mr. Evarts said he would vote for the
bill that grounds of constitutionality
would not cover his vote, nut that the
grounds of expediency would.
HOUSE.
WASHINGTON,Dec.11.—A bill was passed
extending the laws of the United States
over certain unorganized territory south of
the state of Kansas, known as the public
land strip, and providing that this land
shall be subject to entry by actual settlers
under the homestead iaw. Mr. Payson, of
Illinois, on behalf of the committee of pub­
lic lands, called up the bill declaring a for­
feiture of the Ontonagon and Brule river
land grant The bill passed without divi­
sion. It forfeits 384,600 acres. The house
then went into committee of the whole ou
the sundry civil appropriation bill.
In the course of the general debate, Mr.
Lanliam, of Texas, made an appeal in fa­
vor of the redemption of the trade dollar,
and alluding to the standard silver dollar,
he declared that its coinage would never
be suspended, no matter who might, recom­
mend it to tlie contrary. Mr. Herbert, of Al­
abama, said that while the sundry civil
bill appropriated less than the bill of last
year, the decrease was attributed to the
fact that the committee on appropriations
had surrendered jurisdiction over the items
of the navy yard and the new naval ob­
servatory. Pending further discussion the
committee rose, and the house adjourned.
MONDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.
Bills were introduced by Mr. Allen, of
Massachusetts, granting the pension to
railway postal clerks who have become
aged or disabled in the service by Mr.
Moffat, of Michigan, granting the franking
privilege to inmates of the soldiers' home
by Mr. Hewitt, of New York, authorizing

by Mr. Cox, of New York, fixing the sal­
ary of the civil service commission at $5,000
by Mr. Springer, of Illinois, for the admis­
sion into the Union of Dakota, Montana,
Washington and New Mexico by Mr.
Thackmorton, of Texas, providing for the
leasing of unoccupied Indian lands. Ad­
journed.
TUESDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.
The Cinnabar & Clarks Forks railway
right of way bill came up in the house
again to-day. "Sunset" (.'ox vigorously op­
posed the bill on the ground that it would
tend to increase the danger of forest fires,
that it would injure the natural beauties of
the Yellowstone park and that tlie object
of the railroad people in trying to secure
the passage of the bill was simply to reach
the mines.'
Mr. Grosvenor. of Ohio, proposed an
amendment to confine the right of way to
100 instead of 200 feet.
Mr. Holinan, of Indiana, took the floor
before a vote on the amendment was taken
and talked wildly against the bill, making
all sorts of charges against the originators
of the enterprise.
Mr. Payson answered him in an excellent
speech in support of the bill. He said in
answer to Mr. Cox that there was not a
tree in the park within four miles of the
proposed road .that no object of beauty or
curiosity of any kind except the Mammoth
Hot Springs was anywhere in the vicinity.
"Pig Iron" Kelly made a tearful appeal
for the preservation of the noble American
bison and urged his colleagues to vote down
the bill.
Mr. Gallinger, of New Hampshire,
showed the folly of opposing the bill on the
ground of alleged damage to the scenery.
Mr. Cox moved to strike out all after the
enacting clause, which was carried by a
vote of 107 to 65, and the committee, on
Holman's motion, rose and reported the
bill as dead.
The house then went into committee of
the whole on the sundry appropriation bill.
Mr. Ryan, of Kansas, and Mr. Long, of
Massachusetts, criticized the bill as being
inadequate, and the bill was then read by
paragraphs for amendment. After consid­
erable progress the house adjourned.

bill was passed bringing the cities of At­
lanta, Ga., Galveston, St Paul, Minneap­

cent of their circulation and deposit.
THURSDAY'S PROCEEDINGS.
The house resolved to go into committee
of the whole upon the consideration of the
senate bill for the allotment of lands in
severalty Jo Indians. A number of amend­
ments recommended by the committee on
Indians affairs were adopted, and the bill
was passed. As amended, the bill pro­
vides that in cases where any tribe of In­
dians is located upon any reservation for
its use, either by treaty, stipulation, or by
virtue of an act of congress or executive or­
der, the secretary of the interior is author­
ized, whenever in his opinion any reserva­
tion of such Indians is advantageous for
agricultural and grazing purposes, to cause
said reservation to be surveyed, or resur
veyed if necessary, and to allot, lands in
said reservation in severalty to Indians lo­
cated thereon, upon their application, in
quantities as follows: To each head of a
family, one quarter section to eachj[siugle
person over 18 years, one-eighth section to
each orphan child under 18, one-sixteenth
section: provided, that in case there is not
sufficient land in any of said reservations
to allot lands to each individual of the
classes above named, in quantities as pro­
vided above, lands embraced in such reser­
vation or reservations shall be allotted to
each individual of each of said classes pro
rata in accordance with the provisions of
this act. It further provides that for a pe­
riod of twenty-five years, the conveyance
of any such allotted lands shall
be illegal. It makes allottees sub­
ject to state and territorial law and
prohibits any territory from passing any
law denying to any such Indian within its
jurisdiction equal protection of law. The
rights and privileges of citizenship are con­
ferred upon every Indian bom within the
territorial limits of the United States, to
whom allotments have been made, and
upon every Indian who has voluntarily
taken up his residence and adopted the
habits of civilized life. The provisions of
the bill do not extend to the territory occu­
pied by the Cherokees, Choetaws, Chica
saws, Seminoles, Osages, Mianiis, Peorias,
Sacs and Foxes in the Indian territory, nor
to any of the reservations of the Seneca na­
tion of New York Indians, nor to the strip
of territory in the state of Nebraska ad­
joining the Sioux nation on the south,Tnor
does tlie bill authorize the abolition of any
reservation until the consent of a majority
of the male members 21 years of age shall
be obtained.

gent deficiency bill for public printine, re­
ported yesterday. lie said the public

ported the bill to the house and the previ­
ous question was ordered. The house then

bill being taken up for consideration, Maj.
McKinley, of Ohio, a leading republican
member of the house committee on ways

extremely close and doubtful. That is the

will vote for consideration. I do not know

In the intere«t» of the People.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 15.—The Northern Pacific
railroad has announced a reduction of pas­
senger rates in Dakota from five to four
cents per mile. On the main line and all
branches in Montana, Idaho, Washington
territory and Oregon the local tariff, com­
mencing January 1st, will be on the uni­
form basis of five^cents per mile, the pres­
ent tariff ranging from six and a half to
eight cents per mile. This voluntary re­
duction has not been caused by competi­
tion, for on some portions of the line there
is none. The officials feel that the road is
earning a fair amount of money and they
now feel able to do something in the inter
ests of the people.
