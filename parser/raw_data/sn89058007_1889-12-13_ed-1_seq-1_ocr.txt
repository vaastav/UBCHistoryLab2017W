President Harrison's First Com
munication to Congress.
A Review of Foreign and Dnmratlo Affairs

the Government and Hap.
plneas of the I'eople.
Washinotox, Deo. 3. Immediately
after the reading of the journals of the
House and Senate to-day the com
mittees appointed to wait on the Presi
dent reported that they had performed
that duty and had been informed by the
President that he would communicato
with the two houses by a message in
writing. Thereupon a message from
the President was announced and its
reading proceeded, the following being
a synopsis:
"There are few transactions In tlie adminis
tration f the Government, " fays the Presi
dent, "that are even temporarily 1 held In the
confidence of those cliarired with the con
duct of the public lmsinoss. Every Step
taken is under the observation of an Intcili-
fent and watchful people. The state of the
nrTm is known from day to day, ami snsr
gestions as to needed legislation tlnd an
earlier voice than that which speaks in these
annual commiiiiicutions of tt;o President to
ConnrosB.
Proceeding, the President suvs that kooiI
Will and cordiality have characterized our
relations and correspondence with other
f ovcrtunents, anil the year just closed leaves
ow international pieVt ions of Importance
remaining unadjusted. No obstacle is be
lieved to cs ist that can lotiff postpone the
consideration ami adjustment of the still,
pending questions upon satisfactory and
honorable terms.
( AIX AMKRICAN8.
It Is a matter of hiuli sitinifleance, atxl no
less of congratulation, that the Ilrst year
of the second century of our constitutional
existence finds, as lionorvd pucsts within
our horilers, the rcprewentativesof all the in
dependent States of Nort h and South Amer
ica, met together in earnest conference
touching the hi st mcrTiods of perpetuating
and ptpnmlinK the relations of mutual in
terest and friendliness.
, EQUAL Uiri.OMATK! KKPRFSENTATTOl.
It is recommended that we send ministers
rlenlpotentlaty to nil South American conn
rles sustaining diplomatin relations with
the United (Males. All other countries send
ministers of 1 his (,'rade to us. In l'aramiav,
VraK'iay and Holiv ia we are represented only
by resilient ministers. This is not consid
ered judicious i n v iew of our relations with
these countries. Hawaii and Flaytl, the
Prewdent thinks, should receive similar
treatment, and lie Invited to participate in
the present International congress,
f . THE CHINKSK Ql ESTION.
The Chinese question is handled puardedly,
but with due regard to the risilits of those of
the race already hide, and the maintenance
of f riendl v feeltna bet ween this country ami
China. The tamoan treaty is to be su built ted
to the Senate. The President hopes the Can
adian difficulties can be adjusted without
trouble. The President wants boundary
lines in narrow channels of the waters join
ing the irrent lakes so marked H to be visible
to the naked eye and thinks that the extra
dition treaty between us and Great Itritain
should he made mure sweeping in scope.
Such a treaty will soon be submitted.
We want more friendly relations with
Cuba and Porto lllieo. We are not settling
Ppanlsh claims very fast. American railway
builders in Peru and Portugal, whoso prop
erty has been seized by t hose government,
must be protected. The Nicaragua canal is
all 1 !jrlit, thanks to the amicable adjustment
between Nicaragua and Costa Kica.
i AlfOLIMIIN. TlIK SIAVE TKADK.
America is ti lake part in the Internation
al t'onrcss which oonvened in the city of
Ilrussels, lirlvciitm Noveinlicr lrt, to abol
ish the slave trade in Africa. Ve are on
friendly terms w if li Germany. Wit contem
plate with satisfaction Japan's progress, but
judicial rights in Corea must be established.
We are on friendly terms w ith Persia, but
In Turkey things need adjusting. In France,
Italy, lfnssia ami Turkey, naturalized Amer

w ill have to be adjusted. Our relations with

Ot'K HKVKMT.S AND K X l'F.NIHTTRRS.
The tmtcrvaa le receipts from all sources for
the year Were J:s7,n.V),irs.s, divided as fol
lows: Krimi customs, 2XK,kx, 74 i.iiN ; fron in
ternal revenue, f i:ni,ss,r,j.t ;c; from miscella

The ordinary expenditures for the same
period were yiM.iW.edS.fio, and the total ex
penditures, including I lie sinking fund, were
J.vl, r7:. !"'.".. i'X. The excess of receipts over
expenditure was, after providing for tho
finking fund. fc.7,470,IJ,,i..Y.
For the current fiscal year the total reve
nues, actual and estimated, are J.tsTi.d'io.iKHl,
and the ordinary expenditures, actual and
est imated, are Jj'.i.t.omMmo, making with tho
ink itiK fund, a total expenditure of $.14 1 ,321,.
lfi.!l, leaving an estimated surplus of Hi,
678,us3.01. tuk srnri.r.
"The existence of so lane an actual and
anticipated surplus should have the imme
diate attention of Congress, with a view to
reducing the receipts of the treasury to the
ne'ils of the Government as closely as may
be," says t he President. "It has called into
use expedients for putting it Into circulation
of verv questionable propriety. We should
not eiillect revenue for the purpose of an
ticipating our bonds beyond the require
ment of the sinking fund. The loaning of
public funds to the bauks without interest
upon the security of Government bonds, I
regard us an unauthorized and dangerous
expedient. It results in a temporary and
unnatural Increase of the banking capital
of favored localities, and compels a cautious
and gradual recall of Ihe deposits to avoid
Injury to the commercial interests. It is not
to he expected that the banks having these
deposits will sell their bonds to the treasury
so long as the present highly beneficial ar
rangement is continued. They now prac
tically get interest both upon the bonds and
their proceeds.
The deposits now outstanding should be
gradually withdrawn ami applied to the
purchase of bonds.
. TARIFF REVISION IIKCOMVKM)!:!).
"I recommend a revision of our tariff la w,
both in its administrative features and In the
schedules. Some disturbance of business
may perhaps result from consideration of
this subject bv Conirress, but this temporary
111 effect will be reduced to the minimum bv
rompt actiou and the assurance which
lie country enjoys thai any necessary
changes will be' so made as not to
Impair the just anil reasonable protect ion of
our home industries. The Inequalities of
the law should be adjusted, but the protect
ive principle should be maintained and fair
ly applied to the products of our farms as
w ell as our shops. These duties necessarily
have relation to other things besides the
public revenues. We can not limit their ef
fects by ttxing our eyes on the public treas
ury alone. They have a direct relation to
home production, to work, to w ages and to
the commercial independence of our coun
try, snd the wise ami patriotic legislator
Pliould enlarge the field of his vision to in
clude all of t hesc.
"The free list can very safely be extended
by placing thereon articles t hat do not offer
Injurious competlon to such domestic prod
ucts as our home labor can supply," the
President savs. "The removal of the Inter
nal tax on tobacco would relieve an impor
tant agricultural product from a burden
which as Imposed only because our rev
enue from customs duties was insufficient
for the public needs. If safe provision
gainst fraud can be devised the removal of
tee tax upon spirits used in the arts and iu
manufactures would also offer an unobjec
tionable method of reducing the surplus.
All'! NO. BANK t lKCrl-ATIOX.
"The amount of National bank notes In
circulation has decreased since the year 17S
S114 lM 72C. of w hich Jv7.7 :M l chargeable
to tii last vesr. It is probable the adoption
of the suggestions made by the Comptroler
of the furrencv. viz. : That the minimum
denositef bond for the establishment of
banks be reduced, and that an Issue of notes
to the par value of the bonds be allowed,
would help to maintain the bank circulation;
but while this withdrawal of bank notes has
been going on there has been a large in
crease in the amount of gold and silver coin
In circulation and in the i.-Mie of gold and
ailvercerliricates.
TUB SILVER QVKSTIO.
Neither the present secretary nor any of
Kis Di-cdecessors has deemed it safe to .er
cisu the discretion given by law to increase
the monthly purchases of silver to J4.iu,
W hen th law was enacted. February ,s7S
the price of a . 1 v e r I li t he m a i k et w as $ 1 , 4 . 10

iejjts, wiUJioii: taobitu (lit mt- J
ket prlee has somewhat advanced, and on
the first day of .November last the bullion
value of the' ailver dollar was 72 cents.
"I think it Is clear," says the President,
"that if we should make coinage of silver at
the present rates free, we must expect the
difference in bullion values of the gold and
silver dollars will be taken account of in
commercial transactions, and I f ir the same
result would follow any considerable in
crease of the present rate of coinage. Such
a result would be discreditable to our finan
cial management and disastrous to all busi
ness interests. Indeed, nothing more harm
ful could happen to the silver interests. Any
safe legislation ujion this subject most se
cure the equality of the two coins in their
commercial uses."
COAST DEFENSES ASH HARBOR IMPROVE
MENTS. We are practically without coast defense.
The President recommends defenses for our
coast cities and the encauipinsf of National
Guard companies in coast works to familiar
ise them with the use of heavy guns, lie
thinks fewer attempts at river and harbor
improvements should be made each year and
more done in individual improvements. All
work begun should be carried to completion.
JUDICIAL.
The Terry killing suggests more definite
laws for protecting United States officers and
United states witnesses. An intermediate
court to relieve the Supreme Court of many
eases is needed. District judges' salaries
need revision; r,000 is small enough.
TRUSTS.
Trusts should be made the subject of pro
hibitory and even penal legislation. There
should be international copyright. Natural
ization frauds are too common, and the Gov
ernment should exercise supervision ovet
the naturalization of aliens.
The enemies of social order who come to
our shores should be denied citizenship and
a domicile. A National bankrupt law is de
sirable. The Postmaster-General needs new
buildings. The law relative to transmitting
lottery advertising and lottery remittances
through the mails is unsatisfactory.
THE NAVY.
More ships are wanted. Twenty-six new
vessels are under way or being designed,
but when built we shall have only forty-two.
The President thinks eight armored ships,
three gun-boats and live torpedo boats
should be built at one. Paying for them
would reduce the surplus.
AFTER INDIAN LANDS.
We are dealing with the Indian j through
commissioners authorized by Congress with
favorable results. Tho President favors
opening up the reservations, putting Indians
on farms and pending iho young to school.
Cattle men are obstructing bur negotia
tions with tho Cherokee. Tho needs of the
public can not long be ignored for the needs
of t!e cattlemen. L,and thieves in New Jlex
must be punished. A new port of entry
is needed in Alaska.
THE TENSION QUESTION.
"I am not unaware that the pcnalon roll al
rendy involves a very large annual expend
iture," says the President; "neither am I de
terred by that fact from recommending that
Congress grant a pension to such honorably
discharged soldiers and sailors of the
civil war as, having rendered sub
stantial service during the war, are
now dependent upon their own labor for a
maintenance, and by disease or casualty are
incapacitated from earning it, no matter
w hcu that d Isease or casualty was contracted
or occurred. Many of the men who would be
included in this form of relief are now de
penuent ipon public aid. This fact does not,
in niv judgment, comport with tho National
honor."
Congress Is asked to pass laws eompeling
railways to use automatic, couplers and air
brakes, to prevent loss of life and limb to
brake men.
THE WEATHER BrREAtT.
The Secretary of Agriculture wants a law
department, lie wants to print his report
but hasn't anyjnoney. The President wants
the Signal Service annexed to the Agricul
tural 1 lepirtment.
Civil-Service reform is progressing. Rec
ords of eftieie.it conductor otherwise are ad
vised, that they may be shown in unswer to
pressure for removal, or used as a basis for
promotion.
THE NEGRO IN THE SOUTH.
"In many Parts of our countrv where the
colored population Is large, the people of
that race are, by various devices, deprived
of any effective exercise of their ' politi
cal rights, and of many of their civil
rights," says the President. "The wrong
docs not expend itself upon those whose
votes are suppressed. Kverv constituency
in tho Union is wronged. It has been the
hope of every patriot that a sense of justice
and respect for the law would work a grad
ual cure of these flagrant evils. Surely, no
one supposes that the present ca,n be accept
ed as a permanent condition. If it is said
that these communitlvs must work out this
problem for themselves, we Irave a right to
ask whether they are at work upon it. Ii
they suggest any solution? When and under
w hat conditions is the black man to have a
free ballot? When is he, in fact, to have
those full civil rights which have so Ion"
been his in law? When is that equality of
influence which our Government was intend
ed to secure to t he electors to lie restored?
"This generation should courageously face
these grave questions and not leave them as
a heritage of woe to the next. Tho consulta
tion should proceed with candor, calnmes3
and great patience upon the lines of Justice
and humanity, not of prejudice and cruelty.
No question in our country can be at rest ex
cept upon the firm base of justice and of the
law. I earnestly invoke the attention of
Congress to the consideration of such meas
ures within its well-defined constitutional
powers as will secure to all our people a freo
exercise of their right of suffrage, and every
other civil right undev the Constitution awl
laws of the United states. No evil, however
deplorable, can justify the assumption, either
on the part of the executive or of Congress,
of powers not grauted, but both w ill be high
ly blamable if all the powers granted are not
wisely but firmly used to correal these evils.
"The power to take the whole direct ion and
control of the election of members of
the House of Kepresentatives is clear
ly given to the General Govern
ment. A partial and qualified super
vision of these elections is now provided for
by law, and, iu my opinion, this law may be
So strengthened and extended as to secure
on the whole belter results than can be at
tained by a law taking all the processes of
such election into Federal control. The col
ored man should be protected In all his rela
tions to the Federal Government, whether as
litigant, juror or w itness in our courts, as as
elector or member of Congress or as a peac
ful traveler on our inter state railways.
SUBSIDISING STEAMSHIP COMPANIES.
The President recommends that such ap
propriations be made for ocean mail service,
in American steamships, between our ports
and those of Central and South America,
China, Japan and the important islands in
both of the great oceans, as will be liberally
remunerative for the service rendered, ns
will encourage the establishment and in some
fsirdegree equalize the chances of American
steamship lines in the competitions winch
they must meet.
A NAVAL RESERVE.
"We should also make provision for a
naval reserve, to consist of such merchant
ships of American construction and of a
specified tonnage and speed, as the owners
will consent to place at the use of the Gov
ernment, in case of need, as armed cruisers.
Kngland has adopted this policy and as a
result can now, upon necessity, at once place
upon her naval list some of the fastest
steamships in the world. A proper super
vision of the construction of such vessels,
would make their conversion into effective
ships of war very easy.
FALSE KCONOMT.
'I am an advocate of economy In our Na
tional expenditures," the President con
tinues; "but it is misuse of terms to make
this word describe a policy tiiat withholds an
expenditure for the purpose of extending
our foreign commerce. The enlargement
and improvement of our merchant marine:
the development of a sufficient Imdy of
trained veteran seamen; the promotion of
rapid and regultr mail communication be
tween the ports of other countries and our
own. and tne adaptation of large and swift
American merchant steamships to naval
uses in time of war, are public, purposes of
the highest concern. The enlarged partici
pation of our people in the carrying trade to
the new and Increased markets that will be
opened for the prodtnJs of our farms and
factories; thefnflrrand better employment
of our mechanics, which will result from a
liberal promotion of our foreign commerce,
would insure the widest possible diffusion of
benefit to all the States and toall our people,
and every thing is most propititious for the
carrying out of such ideas.

JEFFERSON DAVIS DEAD.
In tho Midst of His Family and Sur
rounded by Friends the Great
Chieftain Closes Ilia Eyes
on Earth Forever.
JEFFERSON DAVIS.
New Orleans, La., Dec. 6. At 12:45
o'clock this morning the Hon. Jefferson
Davis, sx-Prssident of the Confederate
States, died at the residence of his life
long friend, J. U. Payne.
From the beginning of his fatal illness
Mr. Davis had insisted that his case was
nearly or quite hopeless, though the dread
of pain or fear of death never appeared to
take the slightest hold upon his spirits,
which were brave and even buoyrnt from
the beginning of bi3 attack.
In yain did the doctors strive to impress
upon him that his health was improving.
He steadily iusisted that there was no im
provement, but with Christian resignation
he was content to accept whatever Provi
dence had in store for him. Only once did
he waver in his belief that his case showed
no improvement, and that was at an early
hour yesterday morning, when he play
fully remarked to Mr. l'ayne: "I am afraid
that I will be compelled to agree with
the doctors for once and admit that I am a
little better."
All day long the favorable symptoms
continued, and late in the afternoon, as
late as 4 o'clock, Mr. Davis sent such a
cheering message to Mrs. Stamps and
Mr. and Mrs. Farrar that they decided, for
the first time since Mr. Davis has taken ill,
to attend the French opera.
At 6 o'clock last evening, without any
assignable cause, Mr. Davis was seized
with a congestive chill, which seemed to
absolutely crush the vitality out of his
already enfeebled body. So weak was Mr.
Davis that the violence of the assault soon
subsided for the lack of vitality upon which
to prey.
From that moment to the moment of his
death the history of his case was that of a
gradual sinking. At 7 o'clock Mrs. Davis
administered some medicine, but the ex
President declined to receive the whole
dose, rihe urged upon him the necessity
of taking the remainder, but putting it
aside, with the gentlest of gestures, he
whispered, "Fray, excuse me."
These were his last words. Gradually
he grew weaker end weaker, but never
for an instant seemed to lose conscious
ness. Lying peacefully upon his bed, and
without a trace of pain in his look, he re
mained for hours. Silently clasping and
tenderly caressing his wife's hand, with
undaunted Christian spirit he awaited the
end.
From the moment of the dread assault of
the congestive chill, those gathered around
his bedside, who bad been watching, notic
ing with painful interest every change of
symptom for the past month, knew well
that the dread messenger was even at the
door. About half past 10 o'clock As
sociate Justice Fenner went to the French
Opera-house to call to Mr. Davis's bedside
Mr. and Mrs. Farrar and Mrs. Stamps. As
soon as the message reached them they
hurried to the bedside of the dying ex
President. By 11:80 o'clock there were assembled in
the death chamber Mrs. Davis, Dri. Cahille
and Kickham, Associate Justice and Mrs.
Fenner, Miss Nannie Smith, grandniece of
the dying ex-President, and Mr. and Mrs.
E. II. Farrar.
Finding that Mr. Davis was breathing
somewhat heavily as he lay upon his back,
the doctors assisted him to turn upon his
right side. With his cheek resting upon
his right hand like a sleeping infant, and
with his left hand drooping across his
chest he lay for some fifteen minutes,
breathing softly but faintly. More and
more feeble became bis respirations till
they passed into silence, and then the
watchers knew that the silver cord had
been loosened and the golden bowl broken.
The father of the Confederacy had passed
way ' ' .,...-,... 1 1, ;
"As calmly as to a night's repose, )
Or Cowers at set of sun." ..,...!
Despite the fact that the end bad -come
slowly and peacefully, and after she bad
been face to face for hours with the
dread reality, the blow fell with crushing
force upon the afflicted widow. As long
as there had been work for either head or
hands she borne up bravely, and not until
the sweet uses for her tender ministration
were lost did she seem to realize the terrible
force of the blow.
Illosrapblcxl.
More than eighty years ago two Ken
tucky boys, born in widely different social
spheres, entered upon still more widely
diverse careers:
"Abraham Lincoln, in Hardin (now Larue)
county,, and Jefferson Davis, iu Christian
(now Todd) county; Lincoin born February
12, ISOO.'and Davis on the Sd of.June pre
ceding. dark sibyl hailed them at their birth
as the coming exponents of an awful strug
gle. No prophet would have dared predict
in the days of their prominence that the
ragged Lincoln was soon to fail, while the
defeated, an invalid during a third of his
life, would survive his great antagonist for
a quarter of a century, outliving all the
actors of his age in the great struggle; yet
such was to be the irouy of fate. History
presents many paradoxic, but none greater
than this: That the victor should fall in
the Tery hour of victory and the defeated
live until almost every trace of the conflict
bad vanished, to die of mere eld age.
.Tbt aac'iton x Jc?tra DatIi wert cf.
v?.-v
pure English stock, but so long tesldent la
America that the type had become thor
oughly Southern American. On both sides
they served in the war for American in
dependence, his father, Samuel Davis,
winning some distinction in the mounted
troops of Georgia. Of his two sons, Jeffer
son early became a soldier, while Joseph,
a man of talent, scarcely, if at all, inferior,
gained a local success as a lawyer and
planter in Mississippi. The brothers were
notably affectionate in childhood, aud re
mained through life devoted to each other.
Soon after the birth of JefTerson, Samuel
Davis removed to Mississippi, locating near
Woodville, in Wilkinson county. The sons
there acquired an unusually good English
education for the time, and at an early age
Jefferson entered Transylvania College,
Kentucky. In 1S24, however. President
Monroe appointed him a cadet at West
Point, where lie was graduated in 1S26, at
the early age of twenty. He had stood
high in his class, and at once entered on
active duty, though for some time com
missioned only as a brevet second lieuten
ant. Promotion was very slow in those
peaceful timas, but he soon won his full
commission, and iu the next three years
demonstrated Lis organizing capacity, both
as infantry and staff oficer on the North
western frontier.
The year 18G1 brought a surprise and
many promotions. Black Hawk entered on
his famous campaign, and Jefferson Davis
was at once given an active aud responsi
ble position to muster in and organize the
new recruits. There has long been a tra
dition that in this capacity he mustered in
the company of Illinois volunteers from
New Salem and vicinity commanded by
Capt. Abraham Lincoln, but there is no
record of it.
Early in 38.13 Lieut. Davis was trans
ferred from his place in Company B, First
United States Infantry, and in recognition
of his services in the Black Hawk war was
promoted to a first lieutenancy in the First
United States Dragoons, of which com
mand he was soon made adjutant. In this
position he made a very brilliant record,
not only as on organizer and efficient ad
ministrator in garrison life, but in several
active campaigns against the Comanches,
Pawnees and other Indians.
It was while in the services that Lieut.
Davis woed and won a daughter of the
eminent General and President, Zachary
Taylor. Her father was iu command of
Fort Crawford, near Prairie Du Chien, and
his daughter, a beautiful and refined young
lady, was the center of attraction among
the subordinate officers. Innumerable are
the romantic stories of their rivalries, the
final success of Lieut. Davis, the bitter
opposition of the "stern parent" and old
Indian fighter, and the final departure by
night of the young couple to be married
by a priest on the western bank of the
Mississippi. Let the young and romantic
continue to read aud believe. Suffice it
that the father remained obdurate for some
time and was not completely reconciled tc
his son-in-law till the latter lay woundei
in his tent after the battle of liueua Vista.
There are as many accounts of what wa3
said there as of the battle of Shiloh. Gen.
Taylor's words appear to have been these,
or very near them:
"Colonel, you have saved the day God
bless you! When Dolly would have you,
she was a better judge of a man than I
was."
June 30, 1S35, Lieut. Davis resigned his
commission and located in Mississippi,
where he lived for eight years the quiet
life of a cotton planter. Then came a
"crisis ;" the annexation of Texas may be
taken as the first issue over which dis
tinctively Northern and Southern parties
confronted each other. In 1843 Lieut.
Davis took an active and most effective
part in the State campaign, and in 1844 he
was one of the Democratic electors for
Mississippi. In 184") he was elected a Rep
resentative in Congress, and in December
of that year took his set in the House. It
was called then a "stormy session," but in
retrospect after the long session of 1849-50,
it was thought mild.
a Mr. Davis took an active part in the dis
cussions on the tariff, the Oregon boundary
issue, the Mexican imbroglio and t'tie
slavery question so for as it came up, but
his speeches at that time indicate a
position far more moderate than was after
ward attributed to him. It is of no Jgrae
consequence now, hut worth noting as
curious matter of history, that iu the heated
discussions regarding Texas the threats of
disunion came largely from the extreme
Northern men, while the most eloquent
eulogies upoa the Union came from the
South. In a speech on the Oregon ques
tion, February 6, 1846, Mr. Davis sai.i:
"From sire to son has descended the love
of union in our hearts, as in our history ard
mingled the names of Concord and Cam
den, of Yorktown and Saratoga, of Moul
trie and Plattsburg, of Chippewa and Erie,
of New Orleans and Bunker Hill. Grouped
together they form a monument to the
common glory of our common country;
and where is the Southern man who would
wish that that monument were less by one
of the Northern names that constitute the
mass?"
While Mr. Davis was active in Congress
in July, the First Regiment of Mississippi
volunteers enrolled for the Mexican war
elected him their Colonel. He resigned at
once, overtook his regiment at New Or
leans, organized and drilled it to a high
state of efficiency, and early in Septembet
was on the Rio Grande, in the army of his
father-in law, Gen. Zachary Taylor. A
few days later he bore a conspicuous pari
in the siege and storming of Monterey,
and, as commissioner, aided in drawing up
the terms of capitulation.
Five months of comparative quiet fol
lowed, and then came the crowning glory of
his military career, the achieveneit cf
which, more than all else, fixed him firmly
ia the affections of the Southern people,
aided him effectively at each turning point
in his subsequent career, made him Secre
tary of War, and finally President of the
Southern Confederacy. This was his gal
lantry, coolness in danger and soldierly
skill at the battle of Buena Vista, Febru
ary 23, 1847.
In July, 1S46, Mr. Davis was in Congress;
iu September he was leading his regimct
against Monterey ; in February, 1847, he
was at Buena Vista, and July of the same
year found bim again a peaceful planter,
the regiment's term of service having ex
pired. In August, 3S47, the Governor of
Mississippi appointel him a United States
Senator to fill a vacancy ; the Legislature
in 1S48 re-elected him for a full ttrm. The
