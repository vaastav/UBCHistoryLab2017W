MEXICAN An*AIBS.
The answer of the French Government to
Mr. Seward’s note rc«pcciing Mexican affairs, is
said to reiterate the assurance already given by
the French Secretary of State. It affirms that
France bas nothing to change or retract In her
former declarations that tho orders for the evacu
ation of Mexico were long ago given; that
she fulfilled all her promises, and otherwise
considers Mr. Seward’s note useless. The French
Government cannot refrain fromexprcssingfts as
tonishment at this demand regarding a "matter
which is already in way of execution, ami pro
fesses Itself unable to understand the real mean
ing of the recent note of Mr. Sew ard, when he so

The reports to the effect that the President was

BAiTiMonc. December 2.—C. C. Fulton writes
os follows In the Baltimore Amtrxei u of Monday:
1 here seems lo be no doubt now entertained
that the New York Associated Press will pass out
of existence in a very short time. The Chinese
policy of exclusive control of the business has
proved fatal to It, The order that no paper r< -
reiving its news should bo permitted to publish
despatches from any other source was so averse
to tic progressive spirit ol the age. that we did
not hesitate for a moment in repudiating the
principle, and severing our connection with an
organisation based on snch antiquated Ideas. The
whole Western press broke from the Associated
Press on the same antagonism to monopolv, and
Uic indications are that the press ot Bono'a and
all the New England (States win soon
follow their example. The papers of
Washington, morning and evening, held a
meeting at the Rational Int<llig*ne t r office, oa
Saturday. and unanimously resolved to sever
their connection with the New York Associated
Press, and receive. In mture, the despatches of
the United States and European News Associa
tion.
•The Southern press have nearly all followed the
same antagonism to the New York monopolv,
at d nil the evening and Sunday-papers of Fhfl
adelphlahavc joined Mr. Craig s new organiza
tion. There ate also indications that one or more
of the six papers comprising the New York Asso
ciation, will refuse longer to participate In
an association which undertake* to assume
the powerto dictate to the press of the country
what they shall or shai not publish In the way
of tews, and wo do not believe that the press of
Philadelphia wf)l much longer submit to so un
reasonable and Improper an interference with
their business.”

Is iffaxinilllan insane ?
The Mexican correspondent of the New
Tork Herald savs:
“ It is reported In French circles that Max
imilian is showing decided symptoms of in
sanity. lie is represented os being furious
towards si rangers, allowing none to approach
him. ordering them from his presence with
curses and threats. His manner at.all times
is said to be very violent, and he is subject
to freaks such as none but a madman could
invent. He appears at the table in his draw
ers, with hair in disorder, his shirt.-unhutton
cd, sometimes wearing a Mexican jacket, at
others a dress coat with all his orders and
decorations- His conduct towards his-attend
ants Is variable, treating them with courtesy
or abuse, with tenderness or oaths, os his
feelings prompt him. In his promenades bis
dress Is always fantastic—slipper* no pants,
a flowing robe and smoking cap complete his
costume—certainly airy and original, if not
elegant and elaborate. This Is the French
story—and the idea attempted to ba-convcy
cd is that Maximilian is-playing mod, and
and that Carlotta also wd .so at Home in
order to excite sympathy for their melan
choly fate, and to smooth the way fbr their
return to the privacy of Mlramart.
The Emperor's friends, however, contra
dict this story, and say it Is merely a French
intrigue, fabricated and set aflcac in order to
give' Bazaine an excuse for deposing him.
They cite facts in proof of their position;
the Emperor, since ho has been, hi Orizaba,
has been In conference with his Ministers,
approved of decrees,, and it is. but a few days
since the French sent a deputation to him
requesting bis return to this city. It is
moro than probable the Emperor's friends
arc correct, although the man has lately had
troablc enough to craze a stronger brain
than bc'was ever suspectedot possessing.
The Emperor Is.stopping with Senor Brin
7,as one of the wealthiest citizens of Orazava.
xnd has with him his ccnildcntial friend and
adviser and chaplain, Padre Fisher. The
Padre was far many, years a layman in
Texas, is perfectly conversant with the Eng
lish language, well posted upon American
affairs, and his Majesty pays greot deference
to his opinions.
New and Cheap Proccos of I*ltaking
* ATrcoshi Iron*
Mr. Charles M.Dupuy has Invented a pro
cess for reducing Iron ore, which he says
will save seventy-five per cent In fuel, al
most the whole: of the moial in the ore and
dispense with the skilled and exhausting lar„
hor of the reverberatory furnace. He first
frees the oro as much as possible from earthy
impurities by washing U when in a crashed
state. He then places it along with
Ized charcoal in thin sheet Iron canisters, in
quantities sufficient, when' reduced, to.
form a mass of iron of the usual weight
of a puddle’ ball. An ordinary sand-bottom
iron heating furnace Is brought up to a re
ducing heat, and, with a thick clear fire, tie
canisters are introduced. Tic furnace is
carefully maintained at a reducing he*l, In
the usual manner by small additions to the
fire from time to time, ah required, and by a
careful exclusion ol the atmosphere. Very
lUtlQblitsl sad a suppressed draft
so as to furnish a reducing heat without
catling the canister. The operation
resembles very closely the process of anneal*
•ngr elieet Iron. Soon alter introduction
the canister is annealed and toughened, as
suming a polished appearance. It should
be the aim to keep the heat In this condi
tion until the metal Is thoroughly reduced;
should It be increased the canisters may be
prematurely destroyed. De-oxidatlon com
mences immediately on the introduction of
he ore, as proved by the biasing of carbonic
oxide from the vents made for the purpose,
and, by occasionally rolling and, at the
proper "time, compressing the canister, It
continues without intermission until reduc
tion is completed. The heat should then
he raised to weld or paste together
the particles of iron, and then
canister and contents being with
drawn are welded, in any of the ways pud*
die ball is usually treated. Very little mani
pulation is required in the furnace. The
whole operation need not last longer than
from four to six hours. A few canisters may
tested at triOiog expense at any rolling
mill. It la believed that from three to five
tons of Iron may with equal facility be made
the same time la one furnace of suitable
capacity. The extra expense Is the cost of

A coircspondentof the New York
says:
TV c had occasion lately to employ an ogt'ht
to look for those drifting waifs of society—
the street boys—at night, near the/ theatres
and the low lodging houses, lie want on an
evening last week to the “Old Bowery;”
going rather too hastily iuto the “pit,” he
found himself caught la a swelling throng of
“bummers,” petty thieves, pickpockets, lit
tic peddlers, street boys audyouug roughs oi
all ages from six to twenty. His watch
pockets were speedily tried lor, but lie was
well prepared, and soon took refuge la the
orchestra to wntch this singular mass of
young humanity below. After carefully
counting, he estimated that there were seven
hundred young lads in the house who were
ol the vagrant and homeless class, and as he
is an “expert” with boys, his judgment may
be relied on. They were mainly about ten
or twelve years of a"", rugged, verminous,
dinv, M shock-hcadeiV’ without shoes or
proper clothing for the winter.
Some three hundred, he estimated, had no
shiits at fill. There they were—some quar
relling, swearing, thieving, ready for any
crime which could give them a living; some
simply neglected, ill-clad, poorly-led, even
hungry, preferring the show of the theatre to
the t»r«au they might have bough’. * * »

The Great Controversy In the Episcopal
Clmrch—What It; Is nil Abont-Thc
Points at Issue stated,
[From Iho New York Wotld, November 55.]
Ko ecclesiastical subject of iipnlcrn times
has created more Jntcresl than the ritualistic
movement now In progress in England and
the United States. The two great branches
of the Episcopal Church, designated ‘‘High”
aud “Low,” hero long becu divided on the
great issue involved in the sensuous worship
adopted by the flamer, and the revival ol
ancient ceremonies and usages, deemed rub
rical. has widened tnc broach which hitherto
Impaired the unity and powerof the whole
communion. Thcleadhig divines ofthe Low
Church party charge their reverend brothers,
wiio are iu favor of ritualism, with trav
elling at a moderate pace toward Koine:
and the High Churchmenopruly declare that
their opponents, though professedly in the
same loid, are proceeding rapidly to the
Puritanic regions of Geneva, where the Al
mighty, who Glhd the graved old Hebrew
temple with his presence, is worshipped In
edifltes repulsively plain, and in which the
wealthy attendants would scarcely deign to
Perform their morning ablutions or take
lunch As the' adherents to both 'tides of
the question are determined not to yield or
settle these ditfercnccs amicably, there is a
prospect that the renewed agitation, arising
trom iLc progress of ceremonial worship,
will eventually end in the snbmUsion of Hut
points at i««ue to the General Convention:
but In that distinguished body the majority
ofthe right reverened prelates are known to
he partially iu favor of the principle of the
High Church party.
A brief review of the points involved be
tween the disputants cannot fail to be inte
resting. M’o present the following to eluci
date the general question;
tue uiua cuuncn partt.
It is a pity tin- 1 the doctrinal affinities of
Episcopalians should result in dividing a
Church which hssnohly withstood the shock
ot civil war and clasped heads with their
brethren of the same fold throughout the
South, in the spirit of Christian charity,
which survives all human law*. The High
Church i«irty have arrayed themselves for
ecclesiastical battle, which must come sooner
or later. Their forces are strong, and they
arc a unit in feeling cn the subject of cere
monial worship. TL r -y apply thcterm«-cm
bodied in the ancient rubrics'of the period of
Henry VIII. and Edward VI. to every article
and ornament of their sanctuaries. All their
altars arc gorgeously decorated with flow
ers during seasons’ of triumph. Latin
crosses appear on their chancels,
and a clergyman of any of the out
side denominations has cs little chance of
being invited to otlicintc among them as he
has of being called to accept the crown of
England. The priests invariably wear sur
plices, and the ritualistic emblems incidcn
al to the festivals of the* mints are promi
nently displayed in their tcrables, on the re
currence of thedavs set apart to honor them.
They conform to* portions of the Llturgv
which the Low Church party deem obsolete
or superfluous. Though not, committed to
the doctrine of the “ileal Presence,’’ they
attach a solemn, it not awfuL .import to the
Holy Eucharistic, otherwise known as the
“Lord's Supper.'’ They approve all that is
msthclie in doctrinal usages, and they unite
in an effort to render the celebration of Divine
worship, as embodied In the Book of Com
mon Prayer, full of all the /rorgeous inci
dents and splendor which mark the clerical
ministrations of the old cathedrals of Eng
land, They couform to the usage* of the
Episcopal' Church immediately after the
Reformation, ami they claim that in so doing
they do uot violate any of the rules of the
Liturgy. To sum up the grounds ot> which
they rely to sustain their position, they de
clare:
Ju rtf. That man, being neither an angel
nor a spirit, but a compound, sc to spcalCof
body and soul, must be reached through the
senses that his Creator gave him •; and that
proper ecclesiastical objects tend to stimulate
devotion.
Strand. That these ceremonial usages arc
in accordance -with the practice cf thccarly
church.
Third. That In their office,as ministers con
forming to the book of common prayer, they
violate no rubric.
ib«r(A. That organizations of pions men
and women, except lor family ties, are
beneficial to the general Interests of the
church.
A full embodiment of the first of these
propositions may be witnessed. on any Sab
bath morning in St. Alban's Chapel in this
city. There the alter is brilliantly illumina
ted end the services are preceded by a grand
procession of priests and choristers it) vest
ments led by acniclfer, beariiur.a-golden em
blem of the redemption. Wneh the chant
is ended like clergy, acolytes, and people
make genuflexions before the centre of
the tutor, and during the Holy Euchar
ist the officiating priest spreads his hands
overtbe chalice in the manner of ancient sac
rifices. The Ittcenc creed is intoned, all pres
ent facing the Ritualistic east, symbolical of
the scene of the labors and sufferings of the
TUvine Redeemer. The people kneel when
the “blessing "is given, aaa at every repe
tition of the name of Jesusythey reverently
bow their heads. In temples of the Low
Church party this practice is only adopted
during the Profession of Pailb at the recital
of the Creed. The chalice is covered with a
patten and an embroidered cl Mb bearing a
cross. All the members unite In declaring
that the ginuflexlons used when the name of
Jcshs is mentioned. Is in accordance with the
Apostoli? command:
‘•That at the name of Jesus everything should,
bow. ’
the low eirpßcn party
repudiate all these ceremonies and declare
that hhev tend directly to superstition.
Their edifices are models of plainness; and
they make no pretence to having what their
oppomnls designate an “altar. 1 * A cross Is
seldom seen is their chancel*, which are
scrupulously neat. They hold the peat
principle that “ God is f* spirit ond.thoy that
worship Him must worship Him. in spirit
and in truth.” Their practice is to counsel
. the sinner, and to transfer him to the ex
elusive care of the Almighty. They regard
the two- Sacraments* Baptism and the Lord’s
Supper, not as efficacious mcana of grace,
‘but as edifying ceremonies the one
Initiating a 'member • Into the official
fold of the church, and. the other merely
“ showing forth the Lord’s death until Uo come."
The faith of the Low Churchman is regard
ed as stoically sublime. Ho rejects material
worship ; he will only burn lights in hs
temple during dusk or night. His purpose
U to render public worship, as embodied in
the Book of Common Prayer, exclusively
spiritual, and, surrounded by walls almost
naked, he • proclaims the great doctrine of
faith m Christ, of His all-sufficient ntoi?-
mont on Calvary, and of the inability of good
works to be a satisfaction for sins. The Tes
tament Scriptures, he .ftTCrs, contains the
grounds on which he relics to reject ritualis
tic worship.
The above embrace all the leading points
involved in this important controversy. The
Kcv. Dr. Dix. of Trinity Church, may be
regarded as the leading representative of
the “High” Church party, and Rev. Dr.
Tyug of the “Low.” That these differences
may be so adjusted as to result in the future
unity of the Episcopal Church 1s “a con
summation devoutly to be wished.” In Eng
land, the subject of ritualism is creating at
this lime intense excitement, and bringing
into play paislcna that are the reverse of
Christian.

Americans know nothing of Ireland or

Broadway is doubtless a noble thoroughfare,
and as a devoted admirer of everything sa

of It. Its magnificent stores, great lSQ<nh,
and not least, its beautiful lady fqut passen

but wltoiTl walk up Sackvillq street, Dublin,
I ftcl “ small.” It is times as wide
as Broadway m lti> w idest part, and some
half a mile fti length. Splendid marts of trade
towerofj either side, tempting a purchaser
with a display of the most costly wares. And
then for the crowd. It is a motley one.

been unjust. Dublin swarms with magnifi
cent public buildings. Its Custom House,

feminine beauties of this Irish metropolis,

mand on every Individual of taste for unal
loyed admiration.
FEKIAMSM IK THE METROPOLIS.
Auu Clill
parent to every lover Cf r?p2l‘!* ca3 l fm *
There ia a stagnation ot trade, and a rever
ence lor rank foreign to the American tuiud.
The exports of this vast city, with a popul i
tion of nearly 400.U00 souls, amounts scarcely
to one and a half millions of dollars annual!
For this there must be n cause, and the only
one apparent is the gross treatment of Eng
land toward her sister (?), Ireland. Manu
factories have been started here, mills put
into operation, potteries, but in
all cases English capitalists, jealous of what
Ireland might have become, have come over
and bought them up and then dosed them.
In this way the only manufacture left
to Ireland is that of llax, nor would
that be relinquished tn her if the soil
of England could produce that plant.
Thus has Englandpcrsistentlvacted towards
Ireland,-cramping her energies aud striving
to stamp out every spark oi enterprise iuihc
Irish character, For the sake ofthe ‘‘human
man divine” her etforts have proved a fail
ure. Can it be wondered at, then, that all
Irishmen do not love this motherly England?
I am aware that Americans have been almost
surfeited with accounts of Fenian swindle*
and defalcations, hut these must have arisen
from American teaching. There is none of
this kind ot patriotism here. The Fenians
in Ireland, and here I except the traitors ic
ferred to in a former letter, arc sincere In
their devotion to their country aud her
cause. I gather, from undoubtedly re
liable sources, that there are Id,ooo Fenians
in this city, all more or less working
men, and ft is not amongst men of
rank aud wealth I look for patriotism.
These men aic armed with, not pikes aud
Hint pMols as informer times, but with the
most improved weapons, six-shooters and
the like, and those, too, of Ewjllsh tnnn'ifitr
turc. Throughout the country the men, I
understand, arc not so fully armed, but bet
ter organized. I would say that Stephens’
statement of 200,000 Fcniaixs being iu Ireland
was nut much above the exact number. Now
the question arises os to what tins number
of men can do against the forces England can
throw into the country. I would say, uot
much and a great deal. If properly olHeercd
aud efficiently organized, such a Miy of meu
can take the country iuto their own hands :
but lam of opinion t hat. without a fleet of war
vessels, which the Fetihns do not pretend to
have, It will be Impossible for them to hold
it for any length of time. Of course 1 sup
pose in* this that all the insurgents arc
properly armed, and that there be a simul
taneous and speedy rising.
There are now iu Ireland eleven foil-regi
ments of inlantrv, nine battalions of infantry,
seven cavalry regiments, and three trorps of
the military tram, besides a large force of
the royal artillery, or in all something a: out
•AVW) men. The initiated will bv this sec
what they may expect to encounter, rnd
what chance of success the “boys” mnv
have.

As already contractors are understood

Wc think the pabllc util agree with that la

It Is true that wort was one without prece
dent, and that they were therefore liable to error
in their calcnla&na. This is shown in toe wide
mcffo of bidding, the estimates varying from
fai3,i; 9, the riiw a; which toe contrast, was let,
to about *1.21.5.0(0. Bntlbrt It must V remem

averaged higher than the contract rate, from then
till now. that the coal of labor and material hare
been higher nearly all the time since then. Bat
not higher than could reasonably be expected
And it they bad made their sab-contract* as they
promised to do, Ihey would have had to pay no
noteworthy advance oa anything hal labor. But
the fact Is they dldnot make those sab-contracts,
and for tho reason that they bad not the capital 1
at command to start with, which tho Board of .
Public Works had reason to expect from their
representations, and without ihe strength of which
the contract would not hare been letto them. They
bad the opportunity for making contract* for their
iron ana lumber, but they did not do so because
they Lad not the money to pay with unless it
should be advanced by the city, which very prop
erly was not done. And so Messrs. Dull is
Gcwan proceeded with the work in a “from baud
to mcuUi” sort of a way, buying the material one
week w blch they wanted to use the next. When
remonstrated with for their lack of available capi
tal, th.-tr only reply was that thcy.had themselves
been disappointed, their friends at the East refus
ing to lend their money Ch each an
impracticable project as the. Lake Tunnel,
though they naa lent before, and would
lend again on a feasible ' undertaking.
The public will not require argument to con
vince them that they are neither legally nor mo
.vally responsible for the Liilaro on tho part of
the contractors to do at the outset as they ha d
at least tacitly, agreed to do. The bolt was their
own entirely.
Bui admitting that the city should In honor
bear come ponton of this lues, that loss has been
more than made op hv the omission of a large
quantity of work which was contracted for.
Amorp these the most important arc the omis
sion or three cribs, which at their own valuation
would have cost the contractor; a t least a oaar
tr of a million to put h». It may be urged
that they were not required to pul in
the Intermediate enhs unless it was proven
*«, . necessary. me 6>cclflcations
did provide that if, after commencing
the work it should be found that four cribs were
not necessary to complete the work in two rears,
(lit* now more than three) one or more of them
should he .omitted, bnt U*U added “TWO cribs
shall be commenced before the probable rate of
pri grecs in the tunnel. from the land shaft, shall
have been satisfactorily ascertained.” It there
fore, they calculated on bat two cribs, thev saved
one, and its cost of not much less than fIOO,OOO.
For this omission no deduction was made on
the contract. This allowed was a very respectable
per centage on the original price, without count
ing a very liberal allowance tor extras during the
progress of the work, amounting to probably
sixty thousand dollars, and the payment for ma
terial and labor by the city, much of wnicn could
have been exacted from the contractor.
These arc the (bets In this case. We will allege
another, which we cannot at present prove: That
when the Board of Public Works shall have made
up its own record of Ihe work done and material
furnished—they have kcot such a record—lt will
bo found that with all their losses by war prices,
the contractor* have made money. If they have
cleared themselves, they cannot In honor ask for
un advance.
Wo trust that before the Common Council en
tertain* the coming proposition to pay an advance
on the contract price, it will at lesst insist on an
exact tooting up of the figures kept br the Board,

A Few Words of Common Sense.
Row few there arc who arc not subject to some afl*c-
don of the lung, or respiratory organs, who, by teg-
lecttsg premonitory symptoms, aggravate the com-
plaint, until disease strikes its shafts, causing Inex-
pressible torture of the patient, and anxiety' hi a.
tress to friends. “Only a cold l" -* a sUghtlsora
throat l” Is the heedless remark of many when so of-
lected. Tea; “ Only a cold,” was the thoughtless er-
pression cf thousands whom death has matkod Dr tuc
Forewarned—Forearmed! should be the motto for-
ever In the minds ol all subject to Coughs Colds, Co
tarrh.or Inflccnxa. Words of advice should be heedad
by all suffering from Asthma. Bronchitis, Consump-
tion. Relief is within their reach; and. If neglected.
total consequences ensue—a Ule of misery—a daily,
hourly itmggii- inr Acootest in which then
can be borons vMor—Dotth '•
Does it cot appal the strongest mini ta think or ti»
result caused by neglect ? Then why delay i What
exetuo can be offered, when timely wanting U so on dal
in year cars? When the 'danger! Is pointed oat, wty
not avoid It? Maesdxs’s Pectoral Bam hashed
used with snccees in nearly amllUon of cases, and ts
ecdorsed by tbe Medical Faculty as the most prompt
and efficacious remedy that scientific research has dis
covered, to relieve and cure all cases ot Coughs, Colds
InCofcru. and Consumption, the case is not beyond
all hope. Sven when the sufferer is in the. last stages.
be will find relief by using this preparation. One bot-
tle will convince the most IncreUnloos, that the merits
ot this preparation are by no means exaggerated; In
fbet—Call far short of the enloclcs bestowed upon It by
thotuanda who have beta ennui by Its timely use. A
guarantee accompanies each bottle, and dealers arc In-
structed la every Instance to refund the money, when
this preparation fitUs to relieve.
