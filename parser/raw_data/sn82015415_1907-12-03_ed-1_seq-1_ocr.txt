Declaring that the United States

R. P. Schwerln, president of tho
Pacific Mail Steamship line, said
tonight that tho company would
not apply for a renewal of its
charter on its expiration on
April 15th and would go out of
business on that date.

This statement was made at a din
ner of tho Society of Naval Architects
and Marine Engineers, at which several
hundred of tjho best known ship
builders of the country were present,
tonight at Delmonlco's.
Schwerln said that ho had asked to
bo left off tho list of speakers, but
when called on and once on his feet
said ho "felt It incumbent upon him
to tell the truth about tho most do
plorable state of affairs, which bids
fair to drlvo our flag from the Pacific
ocean as well as from tho Atlantic."
His speech was tinged with bitter
ness and assailed the Government's nt
tltudo toward shipping on the Pa
cific, and declared that the present
policy bade fair to drlvo tho American
flag from tho Pacific, as well as from
tho Atlantic. His line, ho said, waq
losing money as a result of tho opera
tions of tho Interstato commcrco law.
Foreign rivals, who could change
their rates at will, had pllod up $5,000,
000 In assets, ho said, whllo tho Ameri
can lino, compelled to give thirty days'
notice of a new passenger rate, was
dropping between ?3,000,000 and $4,000,

COVERING OF NEW PILES AT
BREWER'S WHARF IS FOUND
DEFECTIVE.
The protecting metal sheeting on
tho piles of the now Brower's wharf
will ultimately have to be replaced al
most entirely In order to protect tho
structure from tho ravages of the
toredo.
At the present tlmo divers are at
work replacing the metal on many ot
the piles, and reports are to tho effect
that a large proportion of tnetn aro
defective.
Tho metal with whlcn they were
covered at tho tlmci they were put in
only a year or so ago, has become (or
always was) so brittle that It Is break
ing away from tho wood, making It
Imperative that no time bo lost In re
pairing the damage If tho splendid
wharf Is to bo saved.
No ono connected with the Public
Works Department will hazard any
guess as to tho ultlmato cost which
this kind of repairing will entail, but
outsiders havo placed tho amount at
trom $5000 to $10,000.
Tho discovery of tho condition of
tho piling Is not new except perhaps
to tho general public. It was known
that the sheotlug was not what It
should bo beforo tho wharf was com
pleted or taken off tho contractors'
hands. Some kind of a compromise
was effected, It Is understood, at tho
tlmo this condition first became mani
fest, by which somo robato was mado
to tho contracting firm of Lord & Bol
ser through Hackfold & Co., and tho
Pacific Hardware Company through
whom tho motal was purchased.
It Is stated by waterfrontors that
thero la not another structure on tho
watorfront In which such trouble with
the sheeting has occurred. Just what
tho composition is which was used Is
not known, other than as "yellow
metal." There Is no question that It
Is something very inferior for tho
purposo for which It was put.

aid to American vessels.
Regarding Hawaii the President says: "The unfortunate failure of the
shipping bill In the last session of the Congress was followed- by tne
taking off of certain Pacific steamships, which greatly hampered movements
of passengers befwecn Hawaii and tho Mainland.
"Unless the Congress Is prepared by positive encouragement to secure
proper facilities in the way of shipping between Hawaii and tho Mainland,
tho coastwise shipping laws should be relaxed to prevent Hawaii suffer
ing again.
"I again will. your attention to the capital Importance from every stand
point of making Pearl Harbor available for the largest deep water ves
sels and suitably fortifying tho Islands."

TRIAL SET
(.Associated Press Cable to The Btar.)
SAN FRANCISCO, December 3.
Calhoun, tho trolley magnato, will be
tried on Thursday. He is charged
with bribery.
The San Francisco Call says edi
torially: "Hon. Jonah Kuhlo Kalani
anaolo has Incurred tho wrath of tho
Navy Department. Tho Ha
waiian gentleman, being a delegate to
congress, was requested by the geueral
navy board to work up a sentiment In
favor ot fortifying Pearl Hurbor In or
der that congress might feel impress
ed by tho apparently Imperative and
spontaneous public demnnd. Tho Hon.
Jonah, etc., was not to appear in tho
matter anywhere and was asked to
treat the communication as strictly
confidential But Jonah had no idea
ot effacing himself in that manner.
Straightway on receipt of tho letter
from the navy board ho took It to all
tho newspapers to how how great a
man ho had become In the national
councils. Tho result may bo that con
gress will refuse the appropriation on
tho ground that the navy board has!
been caught lobbying and pulling;
wires. Thero aro some fine old crust-j
ed bureaucrats in Washington who
wish that the newest Jonah had found
his fit berth In the belly of a whale
and stayed there."
In connection with the foregoing,
It is recalled that Admiral Very, a
naval ofllcer, has not mado any secret
of his advocacy ot Pearl Harbor ap
propriations, or advice to Honolulu
merchants to ngltato for them. The
admiral was quite openly instrumental
lu having a meeting called to urgo tho
matter and ho delivered an address
himself.
In the foreclosure proceeding of J.
D. Mclnorny vs. Knuleola, et al.. the
commissioner's report was this morn
ing approved by Judge De Bolt, and a
deed ordered executed.
