Kven Leslie M. Shaw is said to
liavc presidential aspiration-.. Oh,
jtshaw !
A man in New York is still jter
mitted to kis his w ile on Sunday
or his mother-in-law.
I'.y the way. what has liecome of
Jesse (trant, and 1niis Stuyvcsant
Clianler with their toy ballKm
IxHims?
It may not lie true that the con
stituion "follows the flan, but n
Ixtdy can dispifle that busi
ness follows jjood roads.
The president's message didn't
mention the split log drag but it
bad a good deal to say alnuit sev
eral less important things.
If thoe New York banks that
are holding the money of people
all over the country don't raise the
lid congress ought to pry it olT.
Going to the Far West to hold
their convention is notice to all the
vorld that the democrats will not
exjvet Wall street to finance their
campaign.
A Texas republican leader is
working tip a scheme to tamK'de
the national coTnetitioti to Roose
velt with a big white Teddy I tear.
A black one would be more appro
priate. An interstate field trial of setters
will take place in Tarrant county
next week. Many dogs from vari
ous states have arrived and the
values of some dogs range from
51.750 to 5;.oiio.
If a farmer should ever wish to
sell bis farm it would Itc a great
inducement to purchasers if be
could show that the road from it
to Bryan was a good one and was
always kept in first class condition.
Any restrictions of the right to
buy and sell where, when, of
wliom and to whom one pleases is
necessary to "the pursuit of happi
ness" mentioned in the Declara
tion of IndcjH-ndencc as an inalien
able right. Therefore the protec
tive tariff is a tyrrannical imposi
ti n.
The invincible armada of battle
ships and other vessels of war,
numbering in all more than forty,
set sail yesterday, at 10 o'clock
from Ilamjiton Roads for the long
cruise around CajK Horn to San
Francisco, and thence across the
Pacific. It w ill cost millions of dol
lars and the only object is to show
off. In sjiectacnlar stunts, Roose
velt is unrivalled.
The elimination of Roosevelt
from the field of candidates for the
presidential nomination has greatly
encouraged the other aspirants.
The friends of each claim an ac
cession of strength for their fa
vorite, but Tal't seems to have the
liest hand in the new deal. Further
developments, however, may show
that Hughes, who is not an
avowed candidate, is stronger than
any of those now in the ojvn field.
One result of the announcement is
that C'ortelyou has come out of the
bush and has liegun a vigor-
rnnm.ii"ti for lu notlliliaion.
1 lie denies, however, that he will re
tire from the cabinet.
The New York Sim has taken
his measure and gives the dimens
sions as follows: "So the hero
of all heroes, the tenth Worthy and
Champion, the bravest, wisest, liest
of mankind, the ocean of
words, the god of the hearth,
the patron saint of chil
dren and sports, the regulator of
everything, the instinctive master
of ail knowledge, the earth shaker,
the Tied I'iier, with all he coun
ry for his Ilamelin. the talk-all,
write-all, dvall. mar-all, Herculej-Mcrairy-.tolk-Zcus,
the pan
theon ol the people, the conqueror
of silence and ol he railroads,
cheered and Moved and wor
shiped as no oilier American ever
was; the uneasy but universal Boss
his halo, too, is sotty: the in
cense is seauter in his temples ;
many of the faithful blaspheme;
the god is found to In" only a man
and not so much of a man at that."
