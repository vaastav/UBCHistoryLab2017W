It was not quite 12 o'clock when
Senator Bacon, president pro teni,
took the chair at tr.e desk of the lata
Vice President Sherman and rapped
for order in the seriate, senators
surged through the doors at the last
moment and it took seme time to se
cure order for the prayer by the chap
lain, the Rev. U. G. B. Pearce. Failure
of members of the house to reach the
floor, delayed the opening of the ses
sion in the house about a minute af
ter the hour of neon. When Speaker
Clark climbed the stairs to the ros
trum, he was greted by applause and
cheers from the floor and crowded
galleries. When the prayer was con
cluded a burst of applause greeted
Representative William Sulzcr, flov-
ernor-elect cf New York, as he took
his seat.
The roll call by states followed,
When the name of former Speaker

er the adoption of tlie customary reso
lution to appoint members of a com-!
mi! tee to notify the president that
congress had assembled, Senator
Lodge moved that the senate meet to-!
morrow at 1 o'clock. It was adapted,
without debate, the purpose being to ;
give time for the reading of President.,
Taft's message before the hour set :
for th'? convening ot the Archbold ,
court, of impeachment, at 12:30. i
Senator Root gave the senate the ;
formal notification of the death of
Vice President Sherman. ' j
Resolutions were adopted covering
the5 senate's sympathy to Ihe family
of the late vice president.
Senator ilorah presented the notifi
cation of the death of his colleague,
Senator Heyburn, and Senator Smith

the members who had died since the
last adjournment.
Washington, D. C, , Dec. 2. The
third session of the Ci2nd congress be
gins at noon today under circum
stances of unusual interest. It comes
together after a political upheaval of
far reaching extent which will soon j
transfer all the executive and legisla
tive biaaclies of the federal govern- j
ment to democratic control. j
While the present session is mere- j
ly the expiring stage of a congress j
soon to go out of existence and io be j
superceded in political control and .
policy after March 4, yet today's ses
sions in the senate and house bring i

elements of the various parties who

SUPREME COURT OF THE UKITED STATES RENDERS DECISION IN WHICH
IT DECLARES BIG CONCERN CAN NOT SECURE CONTROL CF SOUTHERN
PACIFIC THROUGH HOLDING SLOCKS OF SOUTHERN LINE
UUim UIIEUil UL i i
A
Washington, D. C, Dec. 2. The
supreme court today in an opinion an
; nounceel by Justice Day. held that the
Union Pacific Railroad company by
I the acquisition of stock in the South
ern Pacific had effected a combina
tion in violation of the Sherman anti
trust law.
Justice Day, reading the opinion,
indicated that the court would enter
a decree to dissolve the combination
and also an injunction to prevent the
Union Pacific from voting Southern
Pacific stock.
In announcing the opinion, Justice.
Day said: "This court reaches the
decision that the Union Pacific and
Southern Pacific, prior to the stock
perchase. were competitors engaged
in interstate commerce, acting inde
pendently as to a large amount of
such carrying trade, and that since the
acquisition of the stock in question
the dominating power of the Union
Pacific has suppressed competition be
tween the systems and has affected a
combination in restraint of interstate
commerce within the prohibitions of
the act.
'In order to enforce the statute the
court Is required to lorbid the doing
in the future, of acts like those that
are found to have been done in viola
tion thereof and to enter a decree
which will effectually dissolve the
cciubiual ion found to exist in viola
tion of the statute.
"The decree should provide an in
juntion against the right to vote this
stock while in tlie ownership or con
trol of the ("nion Pacific company or
any corporation owned by it, or while
held by any corporation or person
for the Pnion Pacillc company, , and

"As the court below dismissed the;
government's bill, if was necessary,
to consider the disposition of the
shares of stock acquired by tlie com-.
bination in violation of the anti-trust'
act. To effectually conclude the oper-;
atiug force of tlie combination, such,
tiisposit ion should be made subject to I
the approval and decree of the court'
and any plan for the disposition of
this stock must be such as to effectual-'
I i dissolve the unlawful combination;

EXCITEMENT AMONG
RAILROAD OFFICIALS.
Omaha, .'el., Dec. 2. - Intense in
terest was shown in railroad circles
relative to the Pnion Pacific merger
decision. This was especially true at
Fnion Pacilic headquarters where offi
cials in many instances forgot their
luncheon in discussion of the decision.
President A. L. Mohler was eager
for the details of the decision but de
clined to comment, on it. There was,
however, a general atmosphere of re
lief when the result was known. One
prominent, official declared it would
have tlie effect of clearing up many
matters winch Mad been much specu
- I lafed upon. He also asserted it
i would put the Union Pacific railroad
! in a position to go ahead with many
projects which have been held up
awaiting tlie outcome of the merger
i suit.
; New York. Dec. 2. - When news was
i received on the stock exchange of
'til'.'- t,:verninent's victory in the Union
. Pacific merger suit, I'nion Pacific
! stock dropped 2 1-2 points and Soutli
; ern Pacilic declined 2 points. Other
active issues declined in sympathy.
Strong support was accorded the Har
riniati issues, however, and they soon
rallied, making up the greater part
of the losses.
Southern Pacific 4 per cent bonds
rose 6 S i points.
Judge Robert S. Lovett, chairman
of tlie board of directors of the llarri
man system, declines to comment on
the decision.
