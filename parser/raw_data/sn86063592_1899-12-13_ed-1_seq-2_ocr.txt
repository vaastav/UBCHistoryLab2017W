It Is said that Mason's resolution
of sympathy with the Boera will re
ceive the votes of a majority of the
senators.
If Clark, of Montana, Voueht his
way into the senate he has shown
himself possessed of wonJe-ful imi
tative powers, says an exchange.
Of all the people whom a wise na-
tion should hesitate Jto "tackle" the
last is a people whose soldier? put
on their Sunday clothes, slug a hymn,
offer up a prayer and, without life or
drum or trumpet, march aiberly Into
battle. And to talk about the morale
of such a people being broken is to
encourage false hopes of near an easy
victory.
Several of the largest abandoned
copper mines " in eastern Maine will

mines were in successful operation
in 1879 end showed good profits while
copper was quoted at 14 cents. The
mines could also" be operated on -a
paying basis v. ith copper at 12 cents,
but the crsh came when the Wiscon
sin mines put dovfn the price of cop
per to 8 cenva. Now that copper is
so high, it will be very profitable to
mine it.

ATTORNEY GENERAL ON TRUSTS
Indianapolis Sentinel.
Attorney General Griggs shows the
real attitude of the administration on
the trust question in his report He
maintains, as the president did in hiB
message, that the federal government
has gone as far as it could toward
tlie restraint of trusts, and that ad
ditional work must be done by the
states. He says: "The federal gov
ernment has no. constitutional right
to supervise, direct, or interfere with
the transaction of ordinary business
by the people of the several states
unless such business relates directly,
and not incidentally, to interstate
commerce, and such has been the de
cision of the supreme court of the
United States." But Interstate com
merce relates directly to insterstate
commerce, and there is no reason why
trust should not be prohioited from
engaging in it. The existing law is a
farce.. Mr. Griggs - says: "In all
cases where the facts presented to
the attorney; general capable pf, legal
proof Jiave rstaMshed satisfactorily

Foul-Smelling
! Catarrh.-
Catarrh is one of the most obstinate
diseases, and hence the most difficult
to pet rid of.
There is but one way to cur It.
The disease is in the blood, and all the
sprays, washes and inhaling mixture
In the world can have no permanent
eilect whatever upon it. Swift's 8 pe
ri tic cures Catarrh permanently, for it it
the only remedy which can reach the
disease and force it from the blood.
Mr. B. P. McAllister, of Harrodsburg,
Ky., had Catarrh for years. He writes:
"I could see no Improvement whatever,
though 1 was constantly treated with spray
ma vuua, ana ainar
ent Inhaling remedies
In fact. I eould feel that
each winter I was worse
than th year previous.
"Finally II was
brought to my notloe
that Catarrh waaa blood
disease, and after think
ins over the matter. 1
aawltwasun reasonable
to expect to be cured by
remedies which only
reached the surface. I
then decided to try
a" s s n,l after a few bottles were used. I no
ticed a peroeptlble Improvement. Continuing
tbe remedy, the disease was forced out of ml
avatem. and a eomDlet cure was the result.
I advise sll who have this dreadful dleease to
ahandon thelrlocal treatment,whlchhasnevei
done them any good, and take 8. 8. 8., a rem
th&t nan reaeh tha dlaeage and cure It.
To continue the wrong treatment for
Catarrh is to continue to suffer. Swift's
Specific is a real blood remedy, and
cures obstinate, deep-seated diseases,
which other remedies have no effect
whatever upon. It promptly reaches
Catarrh, and never fails to cure even the
most aggravated cases.

Is Purely Vegetable, and is the only
blood remedy guaranteed to contain no
dangerous minerals.

In restraint of Interstate commerce
as is contemplated by the Sherman
act, legal proceedings have been tak
en by him in the' name of the Uni
ted States either to dissolve the com
bination or to punish the offenders
by indictment." Very probably this
is true. And what does the sum total
of the proceedings amount to? Not a
solitary trust has been suppressed.
On the contrary they have multiplied
under this law with a 'rapidity un
heard of In the past. And everyone
of them is engaged in interstate com
merce. Everyone of them is In fact
restraining Interstate commerce. The
form of the law merely pro'ectd them
in their disobedience of Us original
intent. It le a cheap humbug. But
Congress can easily pass a law pre
venting any trust from " engaging In
Interstate commerce at all, If it so de

It is the devout wish of nearly all people to live to a ripe old age.
None of us want to die young. This universal desire can be realized if
care be taken of the health in early and middle life. A little precaution then
will add many years to our existence. Death can be kept away a long
time. Happy, healthy old age will be the lot of the woman who promptly
corrects the ailments which afflict her sex. In youth, Wine of Cardui will
take the female child safely over the dividing line between girlhood and
womanhood. As a wife she needs It to help her through the trials of
pregnancy and childbirth with as little discomfort as possible; At the
Change of Life It will help her over the dangerous place that appears in
her pathway between 40 and 5a Then will come many years of truly
blissful existence. She will grow old slowly and gracefully. To the last
she will preserve that chacm and beauty which are always characteristic

In Which Duly Elected School Direc
tors Demand Recognition at
Such by County Superin
tendent Who Blames
the District At
tomey.
A mandamous suit has teen begun
in the district court again; t the coun
ty school superintendent, to compel
him to recognize the du'y elected
and qualified directors In school dis
trict No. 6, (La, Cueata) and to recog
nize them as such. Fo"- tbe past
two months two public s hools have
been run at La Cuesta, one under the
direction of the regularly elected
board; the other -jnder the direction
of the appointees made by the school
superintendent. . '
School directors had been elected
In that precinct by a comfortable ma
jority on a Union ticket and returns
duly made to the superintendent of
the result The opposition party, the
Republicans, of the precinct were not
satisfied and is said asked the super
intendent to annul the election and
appoint the defeated candidates This,
it seems, was done by the superin
tendent. The perusal of the follow
ing letters will show pretty well the
situation between the district attor
ney and the superintendent, and the
points Involved:
Don Jose de la Cruz Garcia, Villa-
nueva, N. M. ,
Las Vegas, N. M., July 12, 1899.
Dear Sir: The election of yourself
of Don Julian Baca and P. A. Galls,
as directors of school ii-trict No.
6, has been annulled according to
the opinion of the district attorney,
Mr. Chas. A. Spless, and In confor
mity with a decision of Hon. Judge
Smith. ,
Therefore you will not bo recogniz
ed by me as school directors in said
district, in the future. I appointed
your successors and have Inctruoted
them to make claim to you of the
property In your possession belong
ing to the district.
With nothing further I amyours

Dear Sir:
-Las Vegas, N. M , October 5. 1899.
I desire your opinion on the following
questions: On the fifth day of June,
1899, there was held at La Cuesta,
an election for school directors of
School District No. 6; the same was
held according to law, the directors
then acting, serving as JudgC3 ' and
making due return to me of the result.
There were two sets of candidates,
viz: Messrs. Julian Baca, JoFe de la
Cruz Garcia and Pablo Antonio Ga-
liz, on one ticket, and Messrs. Ne3tor
Alarcon, Matlas Garduno and Ramon
Madrid on the other; the first ones ac
cording to the return of the election
received a majority of thi votes and
qualified'as directors by taking and
filing with me their oath of office ac
cording to law. ,
It is alleged that only tax payers
were allowed to vote at said election
(I so construe the law to be.) Now,
1. Is it within my Jurlpd'ction to
investigate and examine into the le
gality of said election? ,
2. If I have such jurisdiction and
upon Investigation find that said
election was illegal, have I legal power
to declare said alectlon null and
void?
3. If I have the power et forth in
the second question have I a legal
right to fill the vacancy caused by
saild annulment of said election, by
appointment?
The school season beln now oh it
is imperatively necessary that 1 have
your opinion immediately and there
fore would request your very early
reply. Yours Truly,

Dear Sir:
Las Vegas, N. M., Oct. 8, 1899.
Replying to your favor of the 6th inst.
will state that you have no- pow er to
examine into the legality of -an elec
tion held for the election of school
commissioners. Neither have you
power to declare an election void.
But if there has been no election held
in any given district, or If there has
been no return made to you of any
election by the authorities 'epularly
constituted to hold an election, then
there would be a vacancy in the office
of school directors of such district
and you would have power to flli suoh
vacancfes. Very truly yours,

Walking the Ftenr.
When a business man frels to the point
where he cannot sleep at night, where he is
so shattered of nerve that it is torture to
even remain in his bed, and be has to fret
up and pace the floor it is time for that
man to brintr himself up with a round turn.
If he does not. it means nervous prostration
and mental, if not physical, death.
For a man who frets into this condition
there is a remedy that will "brace bim up,
put him on his feet and make a man of hira
agrain. It is Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. It froes to the bottom of things.
It searches out the first cause. When
man is in this condition yon can put your
finger on one of two spots and hit that first
cause the stomach or the-liver or both.
This great medicine acts directly on these
pots. It promptly transform a weak stom
ach into a healthy one. It facilitates the
flow of dieestive juices and makes diges
tion and assimilation perfect It gives a
man an appetite like a boys, it invigor
ates the liver. ' It fills the blood with the
life-giving elements of the food, and makes
it pure, rich, red and plentiful. The blood
is the life current, and when it Is filled with
the elements that build new and healthy
tissues, it docs not take long to maite a man
well and strong. It builds firm, muscular
flesh tissues and strong and steady nerve
fibers. It puts new life, vigor and vitality
into every atom and organ of the body. It
cures nervoii3 exhaustion and prostration.
Nothing "just as good" can be found at
medicine stores.

in the back of my head and back," writes Mr.
Robert Hubbard, of Varner, Lincoln Co., ArK.

'Golden Medical Discovery' and improved great

everyone that I am in good bcallli."
see In your reply to my letter of the
5th Inst, that I have power to appoint
school directors In case of a vacancy
only; I knew that before, and I would
have never made any appointment
otherwise, had you not advised me
to do so. In the case of appointment
of school directors at La Cuesta you
advised verbally and for several times
you Insisted upon me to make such ap
pointment. I was not In ivor cf do
ing so, and for many times before you
could Induce me to make the ap
pointment, I requested your written
opinion on the matter, BUT YOU
HAD NOT THE COURA.GE TO
WRITE WHAT YOU DID DARE TO
ADVISE. I see now that you have
advised me to do what is not right,
and consequently I will ' not follow
your advice, for by so doing I ruin my
self, while you being the promoter of
this struggle, you know very well how
to save yourself, after advising others
to fall into trouble.
I hope you will not be-nffendod, for
I simply call to your memory that
your words of advice are still fresh In
