President's Message, taken from tlie Halti
mnre Sun of Tuesday, as also tin* report of
tlie Postmaster General:
TUB REASSEMBLING OF CONOHKSS.
The second session of the fortieth Congress
commenced at Washington yesterday.—
There was a quorum present in both hou
ses, and soon after meeting a committee
was appointed to wait on the President,
who sent in his annual message. In both
houses a large number of bills, pending at
the last session, were introduced and re
ferred. In the House objections were made
to swearing in Messrs. Sherrard and Dix,
of Alabama, and they were directed to
“stand aside” until their credentials are ex
amined. A bill was introduced to admit
the Representatives of Virginia immediate
ly, but it was ruled out of order, and sub
sequently referred to the committee on
elections, as was also the case of tho mem
bers from Mississippi.
the president's message.
The president’s message has at leas! tlie
merit of brevity, and it-is to lie hoped may
become a model in that respect for the com
munications oi his successor's.
After enumerating tho various blessings
which wc enjoy as a people, the President
refers to what has been accomplished in
the matter of restoring the State govern
ments and to the special case of Georgia,
in whichjhe seems to think that reconstruc
tion in that instance requires to be recon
structed, and recommends a law author
izing the Governor of that State to con
vene all the members originally elected to
tho Legislature, requiring each member to
take tho oath prescribed by the reconstruc
tion acts, and none to be admitted who are
ineligible under the third clause of tho
fourteenth amendment. The loss of our
commerce, resulting, as is alleged, from
the war, will be the subject of a special
message. The restoration of Virginia is
recommended, and hope expressed that
the acts of the Texas and Mississippi Leg
islatures, when they meet, may bo such ns
to receive the approval of Congress, and
close the work of reconstruction.
On the subject of tho finances the tone of
the President: is generally healthy, though
cautious and very conservative. He shows
an earnest appreciation of the evils of an
irredeemable and fluctuating currency and
the necessity for a return to the specie
basis, for which, he admits, no substitute
can be devised. Immediate resumption of
specie payments, however, if practicable,
is not considered desirable, and such legis
lation is recommended as will ensure a
gradual return to it. To put “an immedi
ate stop to fluctuation in the value of tlie
currency,” it is suggested that tlie treasury
lie authorized to redeem its own paper, at
a fixed price, whenever presented, and to
withhold from circulation all currency so
redeemed until sold again for gold.
In view of our increasing ability to pay,
the President suggests also as feasible the
policy of redeeming our 5 and 0 per cent,
loans as they become; subject to be called
in, by the negotiafum of other bonds bear
ing 4 and 4-j per cent, interest. The Pres
ident recommends the postponement of a
general revision of the tariff and taxation
laws for the present, but suggests a re
newal Of the tax on incomes,"at a reduced
rate, say of 3 per cent., and this to expire
in three years. The revenues of this coun
try afo greater than tho requirements, and
may with safety be reduced; but £Ts the fund
ing in a 4 or a 4J per cent, loan would re
duce the annual current expenses largely,
thu,s after funding, justifying a greater re
duction of taxes than would how be ex
pected, be suggests the postponement of the
question till the next Congress, though in
stances of burdensome discrimination might
now lie modified.
In regard to Cuba, while sympathizing
with it, tlie contest lias at no time assumed
a condition sufficient to justify a recogni
tion of belligerency, but tlie principle is
maintained that this government is its
own judge when to accord that right. It
is hoped that the good offices of the Uni
ted States may yet prove advantageous for
a settlement*
Tho subject of tho Darien canal is favor
ably mentioned. The only grave question
which the Union lias with any foreign na
tion is that concerning the Alabama claims.
Tlie President regarded the late conven
tion as misconceived in its scope, and not
calculated to secure a hearty settlement,
and therefore approved its rejection by
tlie Senate as in the interests of peace.
Ho makes quite a summary of the con
siderations to lie provided for, beyond mere
commercial claims, and hopes the time
will soon arrive when the two governments
can approacli the solution of the momentous
subject satisfactorily.
Tlie question of the Spanish gunboats it
is briefly stated lias been referred to the
courts.
The remainder of the message treats of
tlie landing of the French telegraphic ca
ble upon our soil, and promisee endeavors
to secure by negotiation an abandonment
of the principle of monopolies in ocean
telegraphic cables; citizenship of tlie Un
ited States; our relations to China and Ja
pan, and such legislation as will preclude
tlie enslavement of the Chinese under the
name pf coolies; recommendation of a total
repeat of thotcnure-of-oflice nct; and, in re
gard to the Indians, of placing them on
large reservations as speedily ns cop be
done.
Reference is made also to the reports
of the various heads of departments. The
message is in general a clear and coprehcn
sive documents, and wc may hereafter have
•occasion to refer more specially, to some
of its most important recommendations.
REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL.
We give elsewhere a pretty full abstract
of tlie report of the Postmaster General,
and call attention to what he says of the
'n Franking privilege, now enjoyed by over
30,000 officials, and involving an expense
of five millions of dollars, which he justly
as “a special privilege gran
ted to a favored class at the expense of the
many.” He presents a strong array of rea
sons for its abolition, not tho least of which
is found in the incurable abuses and frauds
which seem to tyc inseparable from its ex
ercise. The remarks *of the Postmaster
General in regard to the press, managed
and directed by private enterprise, as be
ing more able than Congress to enlighten
the masses, and that it would bo better to
abolish the franking privilege, and carry
newspapers free, without regard to weight
throughout the United States, indicates a
wise appreciation of all this greatest of
all popular instiutioos for the diffusion of
information.

SPECIAL NOTICES.
Mloiv IMoslfiler'll Hillers cure
Dyspepsia.
THE WHOLE STORY IN A NUTSHELL.
The office of tho stomach is to convert tho food into a
croani-1 ike semi-fluid, called CHYME. This is effected
partly by the action of a solvent, called tlie gastric juice,
which exudes ftom the coating of the stomach, and part
ly by a mechanical movement of that organ, which
churns , us it were, tho dissolving aliment. The CHYME
passes from the stomach into tlie duodenum, or entrance
to the bowtds, where It is subjected to the action of the
bile and tho nutritious portion ol it converted into a
flmil called Chyle, which eventually becomes blood.
Now, it Is evident that if the great solvent, the gastric
juice, is not produced in sufficient quantity, or if the me
chanical action the stomach is not sufficiently brisk,
tho first process of digestion will be but imperfectly per
formed. It is also clear that if the liver, whl(ih plays
such an important part in changing (ho nourishing por
tion of tho rhyme into the material of the blood, is Con
gested, or in any unnatural condition, the second process
will not be thoroughly accomplished. Tho result of the
two failures is dysjtepsia, complicated with billiousness.
The mode in which HOSTETTER’S BITTERS operate
in such cases is this ; they invigorate the cellular mem
brane of the stomach, which ovolvus tlie gastric juice,
thereby insuring an ample sufficiency of tlie fluid to
completely dissolve tho food. They also act npdn the
nerves of the dtoinapli, causing an acceleration of the
mechanical movement necessary to reduce tho food to a
homogeneous mass. Tltey also act specifically upon the
liver, strenglhenhig.it, and so enabling it to produce, an
ample and regular supply of bile, for the purpose of con
verting tho mitrious particles of tho Chyme, into Chyle,
and promote the passage through the bowels of the use
less debris.
In this way, HOSTKTTER’S BITTERS cure dyspepsia
and liver complaint. The explanation is plain, simple,
philosophical, and true.
It is said that the proprietors of tho celebrated PLAN
TATION BITTERS rent no loss than nine pews from
tlie different denominations in Now York city for all
those of their employees who will occupy them regular
-1 ly, free of charge. This is certainly praiseworthy, and
i it is to bo hoped that others who employ a largo number
; of people, will follow the example. Tho above fact, ac
companied with tlie belief that a linn who would look
so closely after the morals and Welfare of their em
ployoose, would not undertake to impose upon tho pub
lic, has iuducod us to give tho PLANTATION BITTERS
a trial, and having found them to bo all that is repre
sented, W(gcordially recommend them as a tonic of rare
merit.— Observer, July Ist.

THE
People of Harford county*, are becoming aware
of the fact that they are not only doing them
selves an injustice, but are robbing their neigh
bors of the patronage which their exertions to

that the
GREATEST
aim of a good citizen, should bo to patronize
home institutions, and to do his utmost to sup
port a man who is always ready and willing to
accommodate his customers, and sell them goods
at the lowest city prices. It seems to excite the

of the public to know how Herman nnd Ewing

chants. They have just received a large and
