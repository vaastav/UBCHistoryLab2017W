Washington, Dec. 9.—On motion of Senator
Fendleton, so much of the President b annual
message as refers to tha civil service reform
non-assessment of government employes for
political purposes, wan referred to a select com
mittee to examine the several branches of civil

Columbia to Fort Wrang^ll end into Alaska.
Referred.
The Vice President laid baton the Senate a
communication from the secretary of war
transmitting copies of correspondence had with
the legal representatives of the confederate
Generals Gre^g and Polk, with a view to pur
chase of their private papers relating to the
late war, as per the aot of June 16, 1880. The
Folk papers have been placed in the hands of
the government wilb permission to use such as
are deemed important to the publication now
authorised by law. The price risked for the
entire collection is $10,000. The Gregg papers
have been submitted for the purpose of being
catalogued. No present price is stipulated for
them, but they, a3 well as the Polk collection,
were appraised in 1878 at 810,000, and could
doubles- not be purchased at that sum. The
secretary says that heretofore no purchases
for the archives have been made from federal
officers, and only trans-Mississippi (Sydney,
Johnston and Sce-d) papers fiom confederate
officers. The great bulb of acquisitions have
been gifts. So far as the secretary knows the
only important collections as yet unobtaicod
are those under consideration. It is far Con
gress to say whether justice to* those who have
freely given the most important documents is
observed by purchase ot other collections.
The Vice President also submitted a commu
nication from the secretary of state, transmit
ting, at request of Madame Thiers, the eighth
and ninth volumes of the speeches of Thiers,

The Senate bill for the relief of Mary A.
Lord was taken up. It grants her $2,100 as
arrears of pension for her dead husband. It
was opposed on technical grounds by members
of the pension committee, as the requirements
of law had not been observed as to tho time of
tilicg the application for pension. After de
bate, the Senate, by a vote af 15 to 33, refused
to have the bill read a third time, and it thus
drops.

cines, friction matches, bank capital and bank
deposits. Referred.
Mr. Aldrich, of Illinois, introduced a bill
amending the law relating to the ti x on sav
ings banks. Referred.
Mr. F. Wood, of New York, said he would
like to ascertain how many days the gentleman
on the other side intended to obstruct public
business.
Mr. Conger—1 call the_ gentleman to order
tor unparliamentary and insolent lane;urge.
Mr. WoodIf it troubles the gentleman I
will withdraw that language.
Mr. CongerThere must be limit to the im
pertinence of the gentlemen who make such
remarks. Whenever the gentleman is willing
to meet the demands of the country and bring
his funding bill for action, we arc even*" will
ing to postpone the present debate.
Sir. Wood —1 thought the gentleman mi?ht
indicate when he would permit the funding
bill to come before the Honse.
Mr. McLane then took the floor acd proceed
ed to speak on the Senate resolution., replying
especially to the speech made
yesterday by Mr. Robeson. That
gentleman had laid down the proposition
that no judicial power could be exercised by
Congress, except by direct grant. The twelfth
article of the constitution was the express
grant to Congress to count the votes through
all time. The idea that the Vice President
could count the votes—that he who might have
a place on the ticket should decide what votes
should be received and what, rejectedhad
never been accepted in the history _>f the conn
try. Over and over again had this .subject been
debated, Unhappily once in the history of the
country a law had been passed under the oper
ation of whioh a count had been made which
would forever stand a monument of disgrace
and dishonor to the country— that
count had counted in a man wbo had not re
ceived a majority of the electoral vol-:.. The
twelfth article gave the House the power to elect
the President under a certain contingency. If
jurisdiction was conferred on a tribunal on a
certain contingency, that tribunal was certain
to judge when that contingency had occurred.
The House must judge when the contingency
on which it might elect the President had oc
curred, and the House could not judge of that
contingency unless it verified every vote. The
twelfth article imposed on the Houso the
actual necessity of counting and verifying the
votes. That was a power that could not be
delegated. Knowing tbat the gentlemen on
the other side meant to set the constitution at
defiance, it was his hope that ho would yet live
to see bis party again in the majority in. the
Honse. If the gentlemen on the other side of
the House chose to obstruct business until the
dsy should come for counting . the electoral
vote, let them bave the responsibility. ; Let
the Democrats await that day, and when it
came let them take their seats and Bee that tbs
votes opened by the Vice President were
genuine votes. Let them Bee that every
elector was qualified, and let them take any
other step they pleased in the way of inquiry
and investigation to know whether tbe electors
who ha-' cast the votes were qualified electors.
If perchance they should find that, as was the
case in 1877, electors bad voted who were not
qualified, let them have the courage to refuse to
certify or connt such votes, or if they found
that the vice-president had opened the certifi
cates, where the votes alleged to bave been cast
were forgeries, let them have courage now and
forever to refuse such votes. Let them do as
their fathers had done— their seats, ap
point tellers, count the votes, and as honorable
representatives of the people certify to the
genuineness of the votes or refuse to certify to
it. fie bad never met a man who had not re
gretted the necessity for the electoral commis
sion, but now he looked back witb infinite sat
isfaction to the fact that the Democratic party
bad both in 1876 and 1880 ths candi
dates who believed it was tbe duty
of the Houses to count the votes. Every per
son felt that in delegating that power to
another tribunal, the responsibility had been
with Congress, and if there had been any
shame or dishonor in tho action if reacted
here, fie bad for that reason never felt at
liberty to denounce that tribunal, He would,
however, never cast a vote to create another.
fie hoped the Democrats would not be influ
enced eitber by filibustering or by offensive
insinuations thai they were hatching mischief.
Except in case of a State which had voted for
Hancock there was no question in any State.
There was a question' and a very serious ques
tion as to the vote of Georgia, fie could not
conceive of any more detestable tbiog than re
jecting the vote of : a Btate except the voting
a State against its will. That was the crime
of tho Republican party. It had accepted
perjury and forgery as a means of certifying
votes. In face of this fact gentlemen on the
other Bide stood here and endeavored to give
the Vice President power to count the votes.
It was an attempt at usurpation that looked to
the future, and there was no legislative action
that was not justifiable to defeat that purpose.
A disjointed running debate then ensued,
participated in by McLane, Calkins, Hunter,
Cos:, of New York, and Mills, daring tbe course
of which Mr. Mills intimated his opposition to
the pending resolution on the ground that
under its provisions tbe Senate might declare
who was President.
Mr. Lftpham said that last session be had
looked upon the landing measure as an at
tempt to debauch the electoral ant. Why
were tbe wheels of legislation now blocked to
consider a question when it was admitted that,
there was no necessity whatever for the oper
ation of the ;• extraordinary pro
visions of this . resolution. That
there was lying, r behind it some
purpose ho wsa bound to assume from the
tenacity with whioh the matter was pressed.
Under its provisions, ' questioning a return
would justify a majority in rejecting tho vote
of a State. It provided that if more than ono
list of electoral voters, or "papers purporting
to be such list," were received from a State,
either house may refuse to receive the vote.
What was this paper? Au official paper. Not
at all, but a paper certified by a chairman of
a Democratic State committee would answer
the requirement of that provision. The Re
publicans were willing to justify themselves
in resorting to every expedient known to par
liamentary usage to resist the purpose of this
resolution.
Mr. Herbert argued in opposition to tit
theory that the Vice President had a right to
count tbe votes. He denied that there was any
political motive which induced the Democrats
to press the matter, unless the desire to- pre
vent the theory that the Vice President bad
power to declare who was his successor from
passing into a precedent were a political mo
tive. .- ' \
Mr. Newberry made an elaborate argument
in support of . the proposition. that the power
to count the votes was vested in the Vice Pres
ident. The proposed rule was unconstitutional
in the attempt to take from the president of
the Senate certain powers and rights and vest
them in the two houses. Pending further de
bate the House adjourned.

A joint caucus of Republican members of
the Senate and House was held tbis evening in
the hall of the House of Representatives, for
the purpose of determining the party policy
in regard to the Senate concurrent resolution
now pending in the House, which provides for
the adoption of a specified joint rule to regu
late the counting of the electoral vote. .Be
tween eighty and ninety were in attendance
and the debate, which occupied two hours and
a half, was quite general. Among those who
took part were Senators Blaine, Anthony,
Ferry and Teller, and Representatives Lapham,
Hawlcy, Conger, Keife, Haskell, Batter
worth, Hiscock and Robeson. The only qnestion
upon which any difference of opinion was ex
pressed was the extent to which it should be
considered necessary or advisable to oppose
adoption of the pending rule. While. many of
the speakers believed there was no purpose on
the part of the Democrats to attempt reversal
of the result of the recent Presidential elec
tion, or any danger at the present juncture
need be anticipated from adoption of the pro
posed rule, many held that a great principle
was at stake, which might at
some time affect the stability
of our institutions and the policy of the party
should be to meet the issue now and resist by
every known parliamentary method the adop
tion of the proposition, alike unwarranted by
the constitution and at variance with the pre
cedents of the post. At the conclusion of the
debate a vote was taken on, Judge Laphani's
resolution declaring it to be the sense of the
caucus that the Republican minority should
resist the adoption o f this joint rule by all
the means authorized by parliamentary law,
and without dissent it was adopted.

SAINT PAUL FRIDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 10, 1880.
THE MARKET HOUSE, ,
A Characteristic Communication from. Col.
Allen ou the Subjeot— Inestimable
-Benefits Conferred Upon the City by the
Completion of Our City Mart
Accompanying the final estimate of the
contractors for the new market house sub
mitted to the common-council yesterday was
the following report from Col. Allen, the
chairman of tho committee, and the father
of the enterprise. It needs only to be read
to be appreciated:
Hon. President of tbe City Council.
Deab Sib: Allow me on behalf of the com
mittee of the market house to present the
final estimate on the completion of the new
market house. v.""'"-.. ■
1 believe the contractors have complied with,
and carried out the contract in every particu
lar. I must congratulate the city in getting so
prompt and reliable a class of contractors.
Everything has moved like, clock work from
tin time they commenced work,:j until the
job was finished. :*'.:■'
Not a misunderstanding or a disposition on
the part of the contractors to slight the work
or wrong the city out of a farthing; not one
feature in building operations has been omit
ted; not a change in the plans nor a single cent
edded to tho cost of the building since
it was commenced. Tbe custom cf the
country is to allow changes in the plans of
construction, giving the contractor an opportu
nity to add one-fourth or even one-third to
the original cost of the structure. Not so in
our case. Our architect, Mr. Radcliff, had all
of his plans and specifications so well digested
and perfected we avoided the customary addi
tional expense, to tbe surprise and disappoint
ment of the contractors.
Well may the city feel proud of such a no
ble, commanding and useful a structure, and
built at so small expense.' Many believed it
would cost $100,000, and none supposed such a
magnificent structure, complete in all its parts,
could bave been built for the money.
In a short time it will be the bee
hive of the city. You will hear the click of
the cleaver and the buz of the butcher's saw.
Fatted bullocks from the Saskatchewan valley
and mountains of Montana. Fish from the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, as well as the
Gulf of Mexico. Fruits from Southern fields
as well as Truman Smith's garden. Flowers
from the valleys and berries from the hills.
All will contribute to our market house.
The grocery man. game man, dairy man, and
tea man, pork and sausage man, all will claim
a place to do business in our emporium. Every
thing a family can eat or drink will be found
here.. Also a hall where the young can trip
the '. light fantastic toe or listen
to ISftthe sweet melody of the
Eolian harp, or listen to the eloquence
of the popular orator. Not satisfied with this,
step in the great room where even justice will
be meted out daily to those in need, on scales
that are properly balanced, and I trust cur city
attorney, W. P. Murray, will attend to the
weighing.
The basement is all that could be desired for
convenience. Here you will find the dining
room tables laden with choice viands, and
tempting the appetite; also the lunch counter,
laden with Yankee pork and beans, fried cakes
and coffee, chickens and cheese, pretzels and
Switzercase—everything good to eat, from a
five-cent lunch to a twenty-five cent dinner.
These attractions will, call people to our
market houso and make it the great trading
mart of the city. Tha rich and the poor, the
saint and the sinner, the old men and maidens,
all will come. The small children will drop
tbeir playthings, and they will cry to come
when their parents start with the market bas
ket to be replenished with the delicacies and
delicious fruits from our great central market.
Very respectfully, A. Allen, Chairman.
.-■-. Last tttghVo ---Concert. •-*.»-,...
A v.ry pleasant and enjoyable concert was
given at the Opera house last evening by
Mesdames Carrie Ettenheimer and Fiances
Bice, of Philadelphia, assisted by some of
our best local musical. talent. The house
was comfortably filled with a very choice
audience, all of whom seemed to take the
liveliest interest in the programme. Liszt's
duet for tho piano, Rhapsodic Langroise
No. 2, waa exquisitely "rendered by the la
dies mentioned. It was followed by a bass
song by W. H. Buckelew, "The Storm,"
sung in the characteristically animated man
ner that has made that gentleman so univer
sal a favorite in this city. Miss Bertha
Bosenfield followed with a reoitation "Cur
few shall not toll to-night," whioh was giv
en in excellent style and elicited
a hearty encore, to which the
lady responded with au appropriate selec
tion. Miss Gilbertie Davidson then sang
the beautiful "Inviolami," from Ernani,
with much feeling, and responded to an en
thusiastic encore with "Come In and Shut
the Door." The flute solo by Mrs. Bice was
a thoroughly artistio performance and elicit
ed a loud encore, to which the lady respond
ed later in the evening with the "Carnival de
Venice." Prof. Otto Schmidt's violin solo
was an exquisite piece of instrumentation,
and received as it merited, loud applause.
The remainder ef the programme was
thoroughly enjoyable, the artists acquitting
themselves with great credit and winning
the loudest applause. It is to be hoped tbat
the entertainment will be repeated at an
early day.

.. THE LAND LEAGUE.
A Public Meeting to Be Called January
loth-New Members Admitted, Etc. ■ -
The regular meeting of this organization
was well attended last evening, President
McCarthy in the chair. A communication
from Rev. Father Walsh was read regarding
the formation of leagues and the remittance
of f ands to the proper depositories.
On motion the treasurer, Mr., Bell, was
authorized to forward the funds of the league
to Dublin as directed by Father Walsh. - •
| The committee whose business it is to
provide for a public meeting by whhh
an expression of public sentiment
as to the iniquitous measures the English
landlords have adopted in relation to their
Irish tenants, made their report and it was
decided that such a meeting should be held
in the Opera House on the 15th of January
next.
Twenty new members put their names on
the roster. There are now over 100 members
of the league in (his city, and when fully
represented there must be at least 250, for
the Irishmen of America are still possessed
of hearts, and witness the oppression of
their brethren in Ireland with strong disap
probation.
John W. Willis, J. 'O'Connor and several
other gentlemen made strong and spirited
addresses; which were well received and had
a deep effect upon the assembly. The
league then adjourned, to meet for the
transaction of farther important business,
on Thursday, December 16,1880.
Condition of the Northern Pacific Railroad.
There are now completed and in operation
600 miles of road, on which there are no
mortgages or liens;.on the Missouri and the
Pen d'Orielle Divisions (together with about
426 miles), which it is expected will be com
pleted before the c! ><?a of the year, there arc
sectional mortgages amounting ~ to $6,500,
--000. Of this amount $2,500,000
has been placed on the Missouri
Division, and on the Fen d'Orielle
division the mortgage of $4,500,000 has been
reduced by $500,000, redeemed under - the
land grant. These mortgages, being prior
to the present mortgage, the ■.. total funded
debt of the company amounts to $46,500,
--000. It is believed that the issue of first
mortgage bonds will amount to $50,000,000.
The amount is limited, however, to $25,000
a mile of finished road. j These divisional
mortgage bonds, like the company's pre
ferred stock, may be used in
purchase of the lands at par; the
new bonds* can be used only at 110. To
complete the road there remain to be built
1,600 miles; 323 miles on the Eastern end,
457 miles on the Pacific end, and a gap of
820 miles on the Central Division, connect
ing the Missouri and Pen d'Oreille divi
sions. This part of the unfinished road lies
in the Territory of Montana. *It has been
considered a difficult part of the route, and
toward the western line of the Territory the
road extends through a mountanious
region. But no difficulty is anticipated by
friends of the company in completing the
road with the proceeds of the present sale of
bonds. It is expected by the company and
by the members of the preeant syndicate
that the development of the mineral and
agricultural resources of the Territory will
aid greatly in the prosecution of the work.
The Union League's Grand Council.
Philadelphia, Dee. 9.The National
Council of the Union League of America
had its annual session to-day. Gen. J. S.
Negley, of Pittsburgh, was elected president
and other officers re-elected. A report on
the Indian policy of the government was
adapted, strongly advocating the necessity
for dissolving ths tribal system and requir
ing that Indians should be made citizens.
Resolutions were adopted congratulating the
country on the election of Garfield end
Arthur, and pledging support to the new
administration. The subject of reorganiza
tion of the Republican party in the South
by inviting the co-operation of all progres
sive men, without regard to their past polit
ical affiliation, was warmly, discussed and
speeches made in favor thereof by Col. J.
E. Bryant, of Georgia; Hon. James T. Beach,
of Missouri, and Hon. J. D. Brady, of Vir
ginia. Mr. MoEaelly, of Pennsylvania, pre
sented a resolution in i elation to the duty of
the Republican party to educate people in
their political duties by means of the news
paper press of the country. The council ad
journed to meet in Washington, March next,
for the purpose of attending the inauguration
of President Garfield in a body.

, an "official" OPINION.
London, Deo. 9.—Forster, chief secretary
for Ireland, has issued a memorandum to
magistrates, pointing out that j under cer
tain acts of parliament persons assembling
armed, or disguised, or assuming the name
of any society, to the terror of her majesty's
subjects, are guilty of high misdemeanor,
rendering them liable to imprisonments are
also those who by threats endeavor to compel
any person to quit employment, or publish
anything calculated to create a riot or an un
lawful assembly. All magistrates are bound
to apprehend, apprise and disperse persons
engaging in these practices, and they can
command all persons to assist them. Any
two magistrates can bind over persons
whom they have reason to suspeot even
an intention to participate in unlawful pro
ceedings or assemblies. In cose of refusal
to be bound over they con -commit | to] the
jail. They.: can (bind - over persons whom
they believe can give evidence relative to
such proceedings, and if they refuse to be
bound over cr to give evidence they can
commit them to jail.
A Dublin correspondent commenting on
this Forster memorandum says the truth is
the magistrate agents and landlords are in a
general panic, and . do net i venture to en
force the laws of the execution brought by
the attorney general to Balinslo, and others
in Sligo have broken down, which has had
discouraging effect. There is also a difficul
ty about treating the land league meetings
as unlawful assemblies.' The magistrates
do not feel justified in regarding the threat
to Boycott as coming within the aot, as it
does not imply violence.. .'..--..
. London, Dec. 9.— Pall Mall Gazelle
says: Everybody will ask why Forster's
memorandum reminding magistrates of the
powers they possess under the existing law,
was not issued months ago. The memoran
dum may now be too late. Forster may
flume over to the cabinet with a request for
a coercion bill so urgent that his ' colleagues
may feel it impossible to resist. If this be
so, parliament will have a right to know,: in
view of his dilatoriness in reminding the
magistrates of their powers, whether he has
really used up to present time and pressed
his subordinates to use all the instruments
tbey already possessed.
IN THE NOBTH OF ttEIiAND. ■■
Dublin, Dec. 9.—The land league is con
ducting the campaign in the north with con
siderable skill, modifying its programme and
proceedings to avoid offending the preju
dices of the people of Ulster. In that pro
vince there is quite a different tone to their
speeches from that prevailing in j other parts
of the country with a view of conciliating
the Presbyterian liberals and orangemen.
The system of boyootting has been applied

EXCITEMENT AT MONAGBAN.
Dublin, Deo. 9.The Monoghan corres
pondent of the Dublin Express telegraphed
as follows: Last night the greatest excite
ment prevailed at Money ban. Lord Boss
more, who was accompanied by Lord Mande
ville, who will assist at the league meeting.
Mandeville telegraphed to his agent to Porta
down, to send 1,000 men to Soalstown with
out delay. Another telegram was dispatched
to the district grand master of Orangemen of
Armagh, to send 1,000 men. A similar tele
gram was sent to Lord C rich ton to send 1,000
men from Fermanagh. These are certain to
arrive, and the ' number will more than be
doubled by men from Monaghan
and the surrounding neighborhood.
The men will be supplied with some means
of defense. Tbe most active efforts are be
ing made by the constitutional party and
the citizens to make each meeting a success.
The assemblage will be the most formidable
and perhaps the most dangerous to peace
that has been witnessed in Ulster for some
years, and if the Ulster landlords take pat
tern by the example set them by Lord Boss
more, Mandeville and Crichtcn, the leaguers
will have little to say in Ulster. .
A noted LIBEBAL'S OPINON. -^V =
London, Dec. 9.— Shaw LeFevre, the new
commissioner of works and buildings, who
is universally recognized as holding the most
liberal views on the subject of Irish lands,
and who stated he was advanced to his pres
ent post with especial view to the service he
could render in the debates on the land ques
tion, in his speech at Beading last night,
said, ownership was the highest degree of
security known to the law. The formation
of a class of present proprietors must, he
said necessarily be slow, unless we are pre
pared to expatriote the landlords at our own
price. It would be easy to show this could
not be for the benefit of Ireland. It would
multiply . the events of absenteeism and
would result in not only a fifth but all the
rent of Ireland being sent out of Ireland in
the shape of interest on the purchase money.
A system of extended ownership could not
last if it had its origin in confiscating and
robbery. Whatever is done must be with
every regard to the rights or compensation
of landlords. He said he had no sympathy
with the plans of intimidation and the vio
lent methods of the land league. They set
up a government in opposition to that of the
queen, and this was a state of things which
could not be allowed to continue.
pbussia AND THE catholics.
Beblin, Deo. 9.In the lower house of
the Prussian diet, to-day, Von Futtkammer,
minister of ecclesiastical affairs, replying to
a statement of Windthorst, an ultramontane
leader, relative to the grievances of Catholics,
said the government fully shared their sor
row at the little progress made in the at
tempt to reconcile differences. The govern
ment, by their last ecclesiastical bill, bod
afforded means for concluding peace. By
the rejection of that bill 1 the material at
their disposal for paving the way to ulti
mate arrangement was totally destroyed.
They could not lay themselves open to an
other, snob defeat, and indeed, assume an
expectant attitude while administering the
existing law indulgently. .

is proposed to constitute Europe as a high
court of arbitration, call the parties at issue
to appear before it to have an argument, and
decide by a majority of votes. This scheme
seems to have been adopted by all the pow
ers, and Turkey and Greece also will proba

MR. GAKFIELD.S CABIMI
Some More Speculations in Regard to Its
Composition.
| Washington Special, Dec. 7.]
Senators in the cloak rooms gossip a good
doal about Gen. Garfield's future cabinet.
Two or throe members of the present Benf
ate have been spoken of as possible mem
ber?, but none of them appear to think that
an offer of a portfolio would be much of a
compliment. Senator Allison has been
prominently mentioned for the secretaryship
of the treasury. His long experience on the
Senate finance committee has especially
fitted him for the disobarge of the duties
of that position. The people who
have been talking in favor of Mr.
Allison's selection are suiprised to find that
be is very cooi upon the subject, and not
disposed to give it any special thought. He
is well satisfied with his pieeent position,
and his friends say that if he should consent
to change he would want to know a good
many thiugs in advance. He would like full
information upon the subject of who are to
ba invited to take seats in the cabinet, and a
positive knowledge the future policy of the
administration. The objections raised by
Senator Allison's friends are those that will
encounter Gen. Garfield when
he breaks his silence and begins to
select his official advisors. There in a sort
of understanding among prominent leaders
of the Republican party that the future
policy of the administration Is to be stalwart,
and that Gen. Garfield will be forced by the
popular eentiment of his party to invite to
his cabinet the most prominent men in the
party. Besides all of these political influ
ences, the position of a cabinet officer is
not pn eminently desirable one, viewed from
a Senatorial standpoint. A cabinet offloer
is loaded down with rontine work, and
harassed to death by office seekers. A seat in
the oabinet is also regarded in nearly the same
light as a foreign mission. It has a tenden
cy to remove a man entirely from active
politics. Gen. Garfield will find his most
willing cabinet advisers in the ranks of de
feated Senatorial aspirants, at present en
gaged in trying to capture this winter's
legislatures. Nothing of the Grant people's
programme in shaping tho new oabinet will
be known until Senator Conkling returns.
He is not content with holding one place
as Senator from New Yoik without also
controlling the position of his colleague.
He is not expected here until
the senatorial fight in New York is
decided. Gen. H. E. Tremaine, a nephew of
Lyman Tremaine,is mentioned now as an in
dependent candidate in case the fight be
tween the Conkling and other political fac
tions develops the impossibility of the suc
cess of any one of them. Hon. S. M. Bow
man, of Lexington, Ky., is backed strongly
by his Republican friends as the special rep
resentative of Southern Republicans in Gar
field's cabinet. Bowman has long been
prominent as a Republican in Kentucky. Ho
was the originator and is the present presi
dent of Kentucky university, at Lexington.
During last summer he was in Colorado,
serving as one of the commissioners to ar
range the difficulties with the Ute Indians.
Mr. Bowman is understood to favor the re
moval of these Indians to Utah and New
Mexico, so as to avoid a conflict, which ia
imminent this winter. It ia by no means
certain that Gen. Garfield will think it
necessary to give the South a place in the
cabinet.
A 6trance Scens In a Theater.
Cincinnati, Deo. 9.—To-night daring a

lent as to attract the attention of the whole

to eject him from the honse. He appeared

he was an Englishman stopping for a time
in the oity.
The St. Paul Fire and Marine insurance
company had a small policy on the St. Louis
