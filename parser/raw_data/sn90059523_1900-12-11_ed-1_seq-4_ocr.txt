• THE SHIP SUBSIDY BILL.
The shipping subsidy bill now occupies
the center of the public stage. The bill
in its present form is being pressed by
Hanna and Frye and opposed by Allison,
Spooner and Mc^lillan— within the Re
publican ranks. A majority of the Demo,
cratic senators will oppose the measure
on principle. Whether the friends of the
bill can pass it in its present shape is a
question. They, however, claim for it
the support of forty-five senators.
The Fry biil is a great improvement on
the original llanna-Payne bill, and it may
be necessary to amend it still further to
secure support sufficient to carry it
through.
The Globe has heretofore taken the
position that a ship subsidy, like
a protective tariff, while objec
tionable in principle, may be expe
dient, but expedient only when the ef
fect, either directly or indirectly, bene
fits the peop'e in general and not a spe
cific few.
The only object this government can
have in offering subsidies to shipping is
the enlargement of our foreign markets.
A subsidy scheme which will accomplish
this result in the least possible time, and
with the least expense, shou'.d be adopted
by congress, and will meet the approval
of a vast majority of the people. So far
as fostering the ship-building interest is
.concerned, w« need give that but Httie
attention so long as ships can be built
in America cheaper than in Europe.
The subsidy bill, as it is now framed,
will undoubtedly aid our shipp'ng inter
ests, but will it have a tendency to aid
old and established lines, or bui'd up new
lines to new markets?
In commercial enterprises, as well as in
anything else, the most dirlieult propo
sition to overcome is the static inertia.
JThere may be abundant markets for
American goods. in»the various countries
of South America, in China, in Russia, in
Japan and in various other parts of the
world not yet visited by American trade,
but the difficulty is to gain a foothold.
There arc few regularly established lines
of freight carriers to attend to the busi
ness when once worked up. There may
be tramp steamers and sailing craft mak
ing certain ports at uncertain times, but
even .thes* are mostly controlled by Brit
ish baerests anj place the freight tariff
so hig-h as to exclude the American com
mercial -.Hlvrrturer.
Whu- is needed at the prrsent time is
assistance that will induce capital to
break new ground to establish regular
lines of freight carriers to new countries
open to American trade.
Tho great fields of Russia, Japan and
•China will afford unmeasured markets
for American production, so soon as tha
trade is organized. To organize and car e
Tor this trade regular traffic lines must
be established. The same conditions ob
tain in South America. The trade of
Brazil, of the Argentine Republic, and
even of Venezuela, is controlled by Eu
rope, because Europe is connected with
tho market by steamship lines and tele
graphs. The whole Western coast of
South America is tributary to San Fran
cisco and the cities of the Sound, but
they can never enter into this inheritance
until they possess definite lines of
freighters to handle th e business.
The surplus of the great Northwest
■must seek an outlet by way of the Pacifl:
ocean. The nation as a whole, must seek
markets for the overplus, not in Europe,
but in Asia and South America. The Pa
cific will at no distant day be the great
'-commercial thoroughfare of the civilized
world
Asia, with its millions, is going to be
the market for which the manufacturing'
and producing nations of the earth will
contor.d.
Our plain duty, then, is to secure as
soon as possible a firm foothold in Asia,
for our trade.
Will the preset subsidy bill meet this
imperatiyp demand? Wlfl it have a ten
dency to open new markets along the nat
ural channels of American trade? Will
It .stimulate into existence new and regu
lar lines of freight carriers to the new
fend fertile fields of Asia and South
America? Its friends say, in Its present
form, it v/iJi assist mightily to this end.
Should the Frye bill pass the senate on
Bfeheaule time, it will be obliged to run the
gauntlet of the house. Here the West
wlil demand to be heard. There may be
changes mado to suit the demands of the
more popular body. If this be the case
let those amendments be made along the
theory of subsidy for new markets and
permanent lines to those markets, keeping
always in mind that the natural field of
American commerce is to the West and
South.

VOLCANOES IN NICARAGUA.
A matter of great importance in con
nection with the Nicaragua canal is the
volcanic nature of that country. Prob
ably no other region of equal extent
shows so many or so marked traces £f
volcanic action as that portion of Nica
ragua intervening between Its lakes and
the Pacific. Here, in a small strip of
territory there are a large number of the
most active volcanoes of the world, be
sides numerous low crates or peaks, still
emitting sulphurous vapors and smoke,
and at night often lighting up the whole
land.
Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions oc
cur frequently. In 1883 the volcano Ome
tepec, on the island of the same name,
in Lake Nicaragua, burst into activity,
when the lava from a new crater began
to overflow and continued for seven days
to spread in various directions all over
the island. Constant rumbling and earth
quakes accompanied the outbreak, and
the terrifk-d natives fled and sought ref
uge on the mainland- Ashes, lava and
rocks now cover the fields that had bean
under cultivation for centuries.
In 1535 the volcano Consequina, near
Fonseca hay, on the Pacific coast, was
lhe scene of one of the most tremendous
eruptions on record. It lasted for four
days, during which time sand fell at
such widely distant points as Jamaica,
Mexica and Bogota. Minor earthquakes
and eruptions are liable to occur at any
time.
One of the effects of this volcanic ac
tion is to raise the surface of the ground
in some places and depress it in others.
Thus the outlet of Lake Nicaragua, the
San Juan river, has four or five impor
tant rapids which make navigation im
possible, some historians claim that at
the time of the Spanish di e o V ery
of the cour try, there were no such rap
ids, and vessels could sail from the
ocean up the river to .the Jake. If that
is true, the ridges forming tho:e rap
ids must have been thrown up by vol
canic action since then.
This volcanic character of vhe country
will have a great deal o-f influence on
the proposed canal. * The mechanism of
the locks will necessarily be co deli
cate that just a moderate earthquake
mj&ht destroy them and close the eaaal
for months, not to speak of the general
havoc that would be wrought by violent
shocks, floods of lava, upheavals and
depressions, caused by one of the ter
rific volcanic outbursts, common in timt
country.
Another important fact in this connec
tion was lately pointed out by a Frcnjh
engineer. A large part of the lake is
composed .of- shaJllbw;'"-sliiftin? ' sand
banks, through which it -will be neces
eary to cut the' canal by dredging.- This
engineer points out that during every one
o£ the violent tropical storms, which are
of such common occurrence on the lake
the sands would be liable to shift in and
completely close up that portion of the
canal. s.

times (Philip 11., I^ouis XIV., Napoleon

Of course Russ a and France would be
only too glad to go into such a deal.
They would fall all over themselves in
their hurry to accept if Germany should
make the proposition, and what Eng
land might wish to say in the matter
probably wouldn't have much effect. In
fact. Prance did propose something simi
lar in regard to Belgium before the Fran
co-German war.
But that is just what Germany won't
do; not unless she wants to cut her own
throat. With Norway and Sweden occu
pied by Russia and Belgium belonging to
France, Germany would be wedged in so
tight that she wouldn't even have room
to breathe. The gain of her nortsl ene

one of their number to Russia. They
will have to stick and stand together;
that is the only way they can hops to
resist Russian ;a£gressioh,' and the more
effectively they can realize this, .the bet

Of course, this does not necessarily
mean that all the countries concerned
need to unite under one government. A

similar to "the Zollvcrein to which most
of the German states belonged before

TARIFF PROTECTION OF TRUSTS.
Congress has convened, and now comes
the opportunity of congressmen of all
political parties to make good their cam
paign professions to enact practical ieg
islation for relief from the exactions of
trusts. By federal statute, as by the
statutory law of a majority of the states
and by common law of the land, as
handed down hy the highest courts from
the time of Coko and Blackstone to that
of Waite ana Puller, the trust in the
United States is an outlaw. Neverthe
less, this trust outlaw in this country to
day boasts of a membership exceeding
1,000, and a capitalization reaching the
almost fabulous sum of $9,000,000,000. The
worst phase of the situation la that the
trust-breeding industry exhibits no de
cline, but, on the other hand, is enjoying
tlie most marvelous epoch of develop
ment. More trusts have been organized
during the past four years, and particu
larly since the passage of the Dingley
tariff, than during all the previous his
tory of the nation.
That the trust should find phenomenal
prosperity in the face of hostile law is
chargeable to three causes: First, the
nonfeasance or malfeasance of officials
entrusted with the enforcement of the
law; second, the inefficiency of existing
legislative remedies; and third, and, per
haps, chief of all, the maintenance of
other laws and national policies which
annul and give the lie to all anti-trust
legislation.
What can one think of the sincerity of
congressional majority whi<;h pretends
to stand opposed to trusts and at tile
same time enacts legislation for the pro
tection of trusts? How consistently op
posed to monopoly is that administration
which champions legislation to create
monopoly? How sincerely antagonistic
to trusts is that congress which would
employ the tax power of the nation to
prohibit the trade competition which
would curtail or eliminate the monopoly
power of the trust? When we erect and
maintain a tariff wall to protect the
trust and fine with heavy revenue exac
tions any citizen who would buy the
comforts and necessaries of life outside
of the territory of the trust, what virtue
is there in our anti-trust professions and
legislative clap-trap?
It is not pretended that the removal
of tariff protection from trust-made
and trust-controlled goods would be a
complete .remedy for the trust species.
There are trusts, like Standard Oil,
which have a monopoly of natural re
sources and thereby are independent of
all tariffs or other monopoly breeding
legislation. But these are the excep
tions. Outside of this small trust fam
ily, which live upon a monopoly of nat
ural resources, there is the vast family
of factory trusts which depend upon a
monopoly created for them by law, and,
first of all, by the tariff law. These
are the trusts; whose representatives
swarm in such number in the lobbies
at Washington, whenever the govern
ment attempts to amend the revenue
laws. These are the trusts' which will
not permit congress, even when th<)
president calls upon it in tlie name of
"plain duty," to do simple justice to
starving little Ponto Rico. These are
the trunts which coerce the government
into giving them, on the plea of "pro
tection to labor and infant industry,"
the hig-hest protective tariff known to the
history of nations.
Few readers, even of our bost posted
business men, realizo the amount ar>d
extent of the tariff protection given to
our hoary headed "infant industries,"
now for the most part organized into
trusts. Still fewer people realize what
extensive efforts are made by the gov
ernment through the tariff to protect and
maintain trusts. Look at the following
examples:
Tho iron and steel trusts, which need
no tariff protection whatever and are
amply able to take care of all compe
titors not only at home, but In any and
every market of the globe, are given a
tariff protection wiiich averages abont
45 per cent ad valorem. The American
people, last year, were fined $5,140,784 for
the temerity of purchasing $11,000,000
worth of iron and steel articles from for
eign makers rather than from extortion
ate American trusts. Is that the way for a
great nation to treat -citizens who are
robbed by the trust outlaw? Deprive
them of the natural right of freedom
of trade, "for fear the trust could not
by fair commercial means hold their
trade and levy upon them its illegal ex
tortion?
The leather trust is protected against
foreign interference with its monopoly
by a tax of $4,000,000 upon tho American
consumers who use about $11,000,000 of
goods made outside of its territory.
Customs duties amounting to over
$2,500^000 per annum, or over 50 per cent
of the value of the imported goods, are
assessed against citizens who seek to
escape the glass monopoly.
Tariff exactions reaching the large sum
of $17,000,000 per annum, are levied against
American consumers of 131,000,000 worth
of cotton goods produced outside of the
realm of the newly organized cotton
goods trust. This is a protection of 55
per cent ad valorem for an Industry
which was self-sustaining a half century
ago.
On woolen goode, for the protection of
the new trust In that line, the tariff
amounts on the total imports to 94 per
cent ad valorem, bein-g In 1899, $13,270,000
on $13,978,000 of Imports—a tariff wall evi
dently designed to be prohibitory.
On sugar, for the partial benefit of a
trust which realizes 12 per cent dividends
on $75,000,000 of stock, the people of th«
United States for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1899, paid tariff taxes of $61,000,000
because they bought $80,000,000 of sugar
abroad.
The wire trust, with a watered capital
of $90,000,600, Is protected at about 50 per
cent ad valorem against foreign compe
tition, and thereupon sells at $3.50 per
hundred to American consumers the same
article that it delivers in Great Britain
at $2.26. The tin plate trust is protected
at a"bout 75 per cent ad valorem, and re
alizes the full benefit of the protection
by hoisting the price of its wares. But
it is not necessary to prolong the list.
There are two objections which are pre
sented against removal of tariff protec
tion from trusts: First, that tariff re
moval would destroy the industry as well
as the trust; second, that tariff removal
would not affect the trust. These two
arguments destroy each other. The one
is the answer to the other. The truth of
the situation lies between the two propo
sitions named. Removal of tariff protec
tion from the trust outlaw not only
would be an important practical step in
-the direction of depriving the trust of
some of its unlawful power, but it is the
first step and the first duty in any policy
of trust reform. Any administration
which wishes to go on record as sincerely
desiring to rid the country of trust ex
tortion must begin first by removing tha
protection of law which is the cradle and
the shield of the trust.

brother, however, having succeeded in
marrying one sister to an English duke,
has his eyes iixed on a Russian title for
the other, and refuses his consent unless
i one condition—what he thinks an impos
sible condition—will be fulfilled. This con
dition is that Bob shall go back to Yale
and be graduated. Bob has already been
expelled from the college, but he knows
that an apcTogy will smooth matters over,
and after .'.ome demurring he consents.
Before he goes, however, he persuades his
sweetheart to marry him clandestinely.
The second act is the cleverest in the
play. Nothing funnier has been seen at
the Metropolitan for some time. The
duke, who has married Bob's sister-in
law, presumably for her money, but really
for love, is anxious to know whether she
i loves him. With Bob's aid he decides to
j test her. Bob is to give a breakfast at
| his hotel at New Haven, and is to in
vite two music halls girls. A bogus tele
gram brings the duchess. The duke,
who is not very brilliant, thinks he can tell
I by his wife's actions whether she loves
him. Everybody who is invited and a
number who aren't come to the breakfast.
Among the latter are Bob's wife, her
friend, his father and a clergyman. The
Gayety girls are hurried into another
room when it is learned that Bob's wife
and her friend are coming in to see him.
I It Is very interesting for a while with
the world in one room, the half word In
| the other. Matters are straightened out
I in the third act, on board the yacht, by
a second marriage between Bob and his
sweetheart, to which the hard-headed
brother consents. The scene is excellent
ly staged.
William Collier's conception of the char
acter of the thoroughly American Bob
is clever. At the end of the second act
he received a decided ovation from the
large audi«nce. An interesting character
in the play Is that of the duke, presented
by Cranley Douglas. As a rule, when in
ternational marriages are pictured on the
f* f« f the tit!ed Person has the worst of
it. But the duke in "On the Qui-t" Is an
unassuming, well bred fellow, If he can't
see a joke. Mr. Douglas' portrayal of the
character was delightful. Arti^c parts
of an artistic whole were John Saville's
Judere Ridyway, Charles B. Poor's Dr
VVolcott, and Brigham Royce's Horace
Colt. The women were equally good. Miss
Louise Allen-Collier played the part of
Alice. Bob's sweetheart: Miss Katherine
MuUdn* was Ethel, duchess of Carbon
dale, and Miss Helen Collier was Phoebe
Riagway. Some of the gowns were de
cidedly swug-gor.
The play wfll be presented tonisrht and

\ STORIES OF THE STEEET. ]
Attorney John L. Towriley is having a
nerve-disquieting time these days be
tween lost dogs and found diamond pins.
Yesterday afternoon. he received a sum
mons to talk with Mankato over the
long distance telephone, regarding a dog
supposed to be his lost, strayed or stolen
canine "Don." It was believed by tna
Mankato parties that the dog was there
and Mr. Townley ordered it brought to
St. Paul. In returning to his office while
on Fourth street, he found a valuable
diamond pin upon the sidewalk. "For
sooth," said he, "I wish it were my dog."
Thinking the owner might still have a
hankering for the dainty gem, he hied
him to the Globe office and Inserted
an advertisement telling of his find and
then wended his way back to his law
chambers. He had hardly got planted at
his aesk before a lady in a great state of
excitement entered and told him she un
derstood that he had found a diamond
pin, and accurately described it. She said
wh<;n she discovered its loss she hastened
to U:e Globe office 'to ' advertise for it
and was told of the lawyer's find. The
barrister sent her away rejoicing, but is
still busy figuring out why it is he's long
on diamonds but short on dogs. Later
in the day he was informed that the
Mankato dbg'was not his.

"When Judge Brill has to loosen to the

'em all, I think. But the hardest propo
sition I brushed up against was a bicycle
raffle, which was supposed to take place
down at a saloon on-East Third street
near the tracks. The proprietor is an old
friend of mine, politically and otherwise,
and I don't know whether the raffle ever
was held down there or not, but the
tickets purported to belong at his place.
I stood for a block of them and charged
it up to canvassing voters. About two
weeks later the. fellow . who sold me the
tickets came in and told me that I had
won -the bicycle and to come down and
get it. I could get a glimpse of
myself buying for the bunch, and as I
don't have much time to ride a bicycle
myself, I put off going down after the
Wheel for some time. Finally a friend of
mine offered to go down and «et it for
me. I suggested that he take a policeman
along and he gathered up big Dan Caah
man. It was a new experience for my
friend, but he did not bring back the
wheel.
"They say you'-^on the wheel," he ex
plained, "and there can't nobody but
Mike Fitzgerald bring it away. It 'd take
the whole police force to get it, I think,
without you."
And Mike's wheel is still there. .

It is not absolutely necessary to the

should be discovered and punished. The
practice itself should be stopped right
now, whether those boys^ are reached or
not. It is not necessary to the making
of good soldiers. Indeed, men of the
true soldierly spirit are not given to the
torturing of the helpless. A fair fight
in the open is more to their liking in the

POET WEIR SEEKS DEATH.
... . ...
Canadian Author Believed to Have
Been Driven to-Suicide.
Quebec Special Times-Herald.
Arthur Weir, author of "The Snow
flake, and Other Poems," and one of
Canada's leading poets, whose parody
on "Our Lady of the' Snows" brought
him a flattering letter from ltudyard
Kipling, called his wife into his room
the other day and then, taking up a
pistol, blew out his brains in her pres
ence.
He was a young- man of great prom
ise and nigh sense of honor, but of acute
sensibility, and it is believed that the
cause of his rash act was a keen sense
of the family disgrace caused by the
recent imprisonment in Montreal of his ,
aged father for irregularities in the bank
of which he was president. His own
writings showed an abhorrence of any
think like tho despair of the suicide. In
*fcis poem, "Nil Desperandum," occur*
the lines:
Face -tlie strife ■•■ ■ .
And live your life;
Be no coward in distress-
Under the title "Timor Mortis Contur
bat Me"—"The , Fear of Death Affrights
Me"—'he wrote:
Earth is so fair to look upon,
And life so sweet, though there sorrows
be,
"Why welcome the summons to be gone,
Timor mortis conturbat me.
It is said that among his papers waa
found 'an extract from Prof. Goldwin
Smith's recent essay on suicide, in which
it was contended that in allowing ir
remediable and intolerable shame as an
excuse Plato had perhaps named the one
thing which may palliate real suicide,
especially in tile case of any one who has
stood high as a man of honor.
Mr. Weir's domestic life was happy, '
and to his wife, to whom "he was so de
votedly attached that he always car
ried her picture in his pocket, he left
: the following touching farewell:
And now farewell—yet e'er we part, one
kiss.
Solemn and sweet as on the bTow of
death.
E'er the dark pall covers the face be
neath;
So now we talfe farewell of all our bliss.
Coffin -our hearts and face the dawn that \.
is,
yet, oh my love, as once again our
breath .-■... . . .... .. .
Mingles, forget not what each heart
throb ; - .
Saithi, That lips may no more utter after
this. : ■ ■ ■ .*-.•;■:
Farernd'lift reWel1' n°W mUSt We stoop

Farewell.^ dark brows, ripe Hps to laugh-
Swift be your' laughter still, be mine the
