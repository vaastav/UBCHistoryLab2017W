There must be something doing when
the bees and the sweet fruits of their
industry become involved, even indi
rectly, in the talk of war.
O. St. John Gilbert, with the Sand
wich Island Honey Co., had an experi
ence with his Japanese superintendent
the other day which may be very sig
nificant. Gilbert desired to give the
Japanese certain Instructions in re
gard to the care of his myriad em
ployes, to wit: the bees, to the end that
two jars of honey might be made to
grow where but one was put on the
market before. The Jpanese resented

THE REAL STRATEGY
Here Is the real strategy of a war
by Japan on the United States. It is
from the Hawaiian-Japanese Dally
Chronicle.
The Japanese people of Hawaii are
believing that there will be no war so
long as that wonderful man Roosevelt
is the president.
But In case war breaks out, unfortun
ately, Japan will not bombard these
Islands or even throw a shell Into the
cities of California, but the very first
thing she will do, will be to gobble up
the Philippine Islands, to occupy per
manently, while her navy will keep off
American trade from tho Pacific ocean
and there will be many Togoes who
will await tho arrival of the American
"Baltic lleet," and tho "Rojestvenskles"
will not be able to enter the Japan sea.
And so tho Japanese will be vie
torlous once more.
DELAY IX CONSTUUCTION.
Owing to the delay of the arrival of
the material, Contractor Whitehouse
has been unable to continue work on
the new Alakea street wharf. The
wharf Is to cost $50,000 and the shed
an additional $45,000.
C. A. C. FIELD MEET.
Tho Chineso Athletic Club will hold
a meeting on next Friday evening to
discuss plans for their annual Field
meet which is to ho held on Chinese
New Years, February 11, 1907. The
Chinese young men have"nlways In the
past made a great success out of their
athletic events and no doubt the com
ing meeting will bo up to tho Stan
dard of the one which was held last
year. When they enter Into any
sports It Is always .The signal for a
large turnout for tho people of Hono
lulu know that they will see good clean
sport of tho best kfnd.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE
CONSUL SAITO WISHES TO WAIT

1053-1039-1003 BISHOP ST.
ALEXANDER YOUNG BUILDING.
The Japanese Consul General for this
place stated this morning that he did
not care to discuss the President's
message to Congress until he had seen
that document itself and had received
from tho embassy in Washington ad
vices concerning It. He does not wish
to commit himself on the message
wherein It relates to the Japanese
question until he Is sure of his ground.
"However I think that the Presi
dent's plan for the naturalization of
the Japanese Is a very good one," said
the Consul, "but I wish to learn fully
of It before I say anything further."
SUPREME COURT ON FRIDAY".
The Supreme Court will not meet un
til Friday at 2 p. m. when the hearing
of the demurrer of J. M. Kealoha In
the election contest of S. W. Logan will

THOUGHT CHINESE DROWNED.
Near the boat landing yesterday
one of the boat boys, John Mahuka,
wanted to get a boat which had drift
ed under tho wharf. A Chinese was
asked to fish It out. In trying to do so
the Chinese fell In the water and for
a time It was a mystery what had be
como of him and some of tho boys
thought he had been dragged down by
a big squid. It appeared, however, that
tho Chineso was merely resting on a
beam connecting two plies, a little wet
and scared but otherwise all right.
