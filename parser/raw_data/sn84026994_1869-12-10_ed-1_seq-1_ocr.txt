vannah railroad, were postponed until Mon. ay.
An effort was made to drag the bill to aid thc

but failed. There was great rejoicing among the
opponents of the bilL
The following bills received their firs; reading:
To amend the law in relation to landlords and
tenants; to define the weight of crude turpentine,

Nash opposed the motton. Cain bitterly denounc?
ed Carpenter, aa unworthy of any consideration.

shamefully. Leslie and Corbin warmly advocated
Carpenter.

bill to compel lawyers, doctors, painters, tailors,
bricklayers, shoemakers and merchants, to bny
$50,000 of S:ate stocks and bonds for the better
protection ef the people of the State. This was
intended as a burlesque on the bill to better pro?
tect the holders of insurance policies, and created
great laughter.

COLOMBIA, December 8.
The senators came into the Senate Chamber
tue morning, prepared to square themselves for
work, knowing that there were on the Calendar
one "special order" and twenty-two "general
orders," waiting te be disposed of. The senators
went to work at twelve o'clock with a vim, and
at three o'clock, the hour of adjournment, had
disposed of ene of the "general orders."
THE MSW IMSUKANOZ 00MPAXT.
The bill to incorporate tbePollcy-holder's Life and
Tontine Assurance Company was taken up, and
passed after considerable discussion. The twelfth
section, providing that the personal property of
the company be exempted from taxation, was
stricken ont. When the bill was taken up, AUen,
\ of Greenville, made a motion to have the name of
Colonel D. Wyatt Aiken stricken out, and anlmaC
verted upon the character of the gentleman In a
most undignified manner. Corbin and Cain ob?
jected jh? the motion, and Allen seeing that the
rest of the senators were opposed to any such ac?
tion as he proposed, withdrew his motion.
TOWNSHIP POSTS.
A report from the county commissioners of An?
derson County was submitted to thc Senate to?
day and appropriately referred. They state that
?hey had marked off the township boundaries ac?
cording to law, bot had not placed thc posts at

THE COUNTY OF COOSAWHATCniE.
The Senate Committee on Counties and Co
Oiticers to-day reported unfavorably upon

lng that the expense ncccssaiy to ccrry otu
objects of the bill would be too great. It wi
remembered that thia bill was intr- 'ed

It provides that from and alter the p. ai

ANOTHER INSURANCE COMPANY.
There seems to be a prospect of the General.
sembly organizing Itself into a fire iusnrai
company. To-day Burrel James, (colored.) ref.
sentative from Sumter, gave notice that he wo
shortly introduce a bill lo indemnify D. J. R
ertson, and Dubose A Co.,of Sumter, for losses s
fained by them through the "action of an arni
band of incendiaries." it is thought that t
biU will pass in the House. This seems to bi
very unjust measure. It will take business rif
out of thc hands of the fire insurance compani
of which there are several very good ones in t
State. If persons whose barns, stores or g
houses are burnt, arc to be reimbursed
the State, thc fire insurance companies h
better leave the field. Tersons will either :
fuse to take out policies with them at all, or
take out policies, and then destroy their prc
' etty, which latter method will prove more dist
trous to the companies than the former. But
is presumed that only Radicals will be paid f
their destroyed property. That will, of cours
be a good thing for them. All of them will i
snrc their property in the regalarly organlzi
compaules, and when it is destroyed, (which w
bc done by "armed bands of incendiaries," as i
onc'wlll for a moment believe that the owners i
tlie negroes, whom Governor Scott In his Surat
proclamation Invited to act as incendiaries, wou
do It,) they will get thc money for thc policy bel
and also thc money for the policy extended by tl
General Assembly Assurance Association. Whi

DBAS,
A bill to grant aid to the Chatham Railroa
Company, which was introduced In the Hous
last session, wus called up in that body a fei
days since and made the special order for to-day
When the hour arrived it was taken np, and
without much ceremony, referred to thc Com
mitlec ou Railroads, which is generally consider
ed as burying lt forever. It kicked and ttrug
gled for State pap for a long time, and it sccmi
cruel to have deprived lt of the desired anti need
ed nourishment when it seemed FO near accoiu
pushing its object.
MOKE FEES.
There ls a Senate bill awaiting passage wilier
provides that it shall be lawful for the treasure i
of the State of South Carolina to charge and re
ceive for each certi?cate of stock, lu transfer o
thc same from one party to another, one dollar
to be appropriated to his own use; and a furthei
sum of fifty cents for each blank used In th?
transferring said sum, to bc for thc use anil
benefit of the State of South Carolina.
THE OOIN BILL.
There was a hot debate in thc House to-day, on
the special order-a bill providing that rl;e prin
cipal and Interest of the State stocks and bonds
bo paid in coiu. McIntyre, Fcriter, James, col?
ored. Miller, McKinlay, colored, and Purvis were
in favor of postponing the consideration of thc
bil! to almost any time, from to-morrow to ten
years hence. Elliott, colored, DeLarge, colore:!,
Tomliusou aud Morrison, colored, were in favor
of its being considered at O::C?, claiming that lt
spoke for itself. McKinlay claimed that thc
bill had not been considered by the Com?
mittee 0:1 Ways aud Means, to which it
had been referred. This insinuation raised
a perfect storm around thc old man's
ears. Elliott, George U;e, Uayue, and others,
members of said committee, denied the statement
in toto. DeLarge, chalrmau of said committee,
stated that the bil! had been thoroughly discussed
at both meetings, t>"r it ivas probable that his
colleague (McKinlay) had not heard them, for he
had noticed that at one of thc meetings tie
(McKinlay) was asleep by thc arc-from what
cause he did not know; that the fourth report of
the committee was signed by every member
except McKinlay. After considerable wrangling,
Elliott secured thc floor. 113 denounced the ac?
tion of those who desired a postponement as
childish-he wanted these members to show some
degree of manliness, but they would not. The
excuse they had just f und for a post?
ponement of thc consideration of the bill
that they had not had timo to think over
it-showed great imbecility on their part ;
they had bud plenty of time. As for the
"gentleman from Coileton,'' (McIntyre, who had
made numerous motions to postpone.) the
speaker knew well enough his imbecility. If he
thought over lt forever so long, he would know
uo more about it thau he did now; in fact, te was
imbecile in niiuil, and in everything else. After
rapping the opponents of the UH pretty severely.
Elliott took bis s*at, an<l thc discussion somewhat
nagged, but was continued until thc hour of ad?
journment. It will come np again to-morrow.
It is thought by '.onie that the bill will not pass;
others think it will, if it be amended so as to pro?
vide fer the payment only of the Interest (not
the principal) In coin, lt is reported that an
amendment will be offered to pay the members,
State officers and pages in coln also.

* RionT OF WAT.
In several portions of this State there are par?
ties who are engaged in manufacturing, and in
order to get their wares to the nearest landing er
depot iu order to have them shipped to market,
have to pay enormous sums for pasplng through
persons' fields. These persona having no law to
govern them, oharge whatever rates they please,
and force the manufacturer to pay it or carry his
goods to some depot or landing which is not so
near, and to get to which canses great delay and
trouble. With a view of obviating this evil, and
to give the right of way to manuracturcrs, which
will bc satisfactory both to them and the owners
o' 'ands, Fcrlter, of Sumter, has introduced in
th .- House a "bill to declare thc manner in which
the right of way over the lands of persons or cor?
porations may bc secured for transporattion of
home products to market."
It provides that the proper application shall be
made by the party desiring such right or way to
the nearest local magistrate, who shall examine
into thc merits of the application, and order a
board of appraisement, consisting of five voters
of the vicinage, two of whom shall be nominated
by the owner of the land over which the right of
way is demanded, two by the party applying for
the right and one by the magistrate; and tn default
of such nomination by either of the parties within
ten days after notice be given, the magistrate shall
appoint a number sufficient to supply any de?
ficiency; that thc board of arbitration so appoint?
ed shall meet at su h time and place as may be
appointed by the magistrate, and if, after a lull
hearing, the board decide that the demand of the
applicant be reasonable, they shall grant the
right of way desired npon the applicant paying
to the owner of the land such compensation as
the board may decide to be proper and Just
provided that no such right of way shall bc grant?
ed through any lauds within one hundred yards
of the owner's dwelling, houses or farm buildings,
and that no damage ?bull be done by exposing
the cultivated grounds of the owner without
proper fencing at the expense nf the applicant;
that cotton, turpentine and other products own?

ATROCIO US CRIME ZR HA RLINOTOM
Wanton Murder of an Aged Citizen by a
Negro Boy.
The Darlington Democrat says : Ono of the
most co!d blooded and attrocloufl murders ever
committed iu thia community, was perpetrated
near this town on Saturday last. Mr. J. LeCrunde
Dickson, a:i old, feeble and highly esteemed
citizen, living on the public road abuut two miles
from the town, was brutally murdered on the
road, about half-past twelve o'clock P. M., with?
in one hundred ?iud fifty yards of his home.
The old mun had been to Hie village, made
some purchases and collected a Binad amount
of money. About mid-day ho left for home,
walking." Ho was found lying on thc side of
the public road, about one hundred and fit'tv
yards fcona his house; he was carried hume nuil
soon became speechless-he died about 2 o'clock
thu next morning. Although able to speak when
he reached home, he was unable lo tell what had
happened lo him. He hod evidently received two
severe blows on Iiis hood from a heavy palin;:,
which was found near him, ami two blows in the
face, indicted by the list of his cruel assailout. Ol'
these blows he died.
By a curious combination of circumstances thc
murderer, while thinking himself safe, was ar?
rested, and evidences of his guilt were found
upon lits person. He is now lu jail, and evidence
against lum accumulates. No doubt he thought
his victim whom ho followed from the town bail
more money on his person than he lound. He
has cruelty murdered u good old man. made or?
phans of a large and interesting family,anda
widow of a most wnrthy and estimable woman,
for an old knife, one dollar and eighty-five cents,
and a little bundle of homespun.
The murderer is a colored man-a youth of bad
character, lt is due to our colored population to
sav that they expressed great indignation, and,
at cue time, seemed inclined to administer sum?
mary and extreme punishment on thc murderer.
His trial will come; bis conviction is certain: the
pardon of the Governor almost as sure. And thea
another murder, another trial, another conviciiou
and another pardon.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Secretary Boatwell, in his annual report tu
Congress, which wu1! submitted on Mond;iy, treats
first of matters of a-' niL-iltratlon and then or
measures or public poi. ./, aud gives a very clear
and comprehensive statement or thc natloual
finances. In the first division of the report the
Secretary .compliments his various bureau oill
cers, commends tte report and administration of
thc commissioner or Internal revenue. Ac. Thc
rollowing are the nioie Important statement*
given :
Thc revenue receipts have increased $14,431,383,
Tor the first Ave months or thc present llscal year
over the same period last year, which is regarded
and announced as a compliment to the ability and
Integrity or the persons employed in that branch
or the public service. Tne cost ror collecting the
customs dues waa ?i,iv.ii,c47 less the last fiscal
year than tao year previous, without any loss of
elJleicuoy in tiic service, huton the contrary, it
is believed thc means employed lor the detectiou
or smuggling are better than ever berorc. Inci?
dentally the appraiser's department Ls commen?
ded In ibis connection.
During the hist llscal year $286,0?3 were pate
to certain revcuue otllclals aud informers in eases
arising under thc customs reveuue laws. A largo
additional sum was al*o paid through the Inter?
nal revenue office; the policy upon which this is
done is that it stimulates officials to greater ac?
tivity In discovering frauds; but m many cases
frauds arc not stopped iu the outset, bul allowed
to go on until a result is reached which trill
inure to the benefit of the otlicere and Informers,
instead or checkiug criminal practices al thc
outset.
The Secretary is clearly of the opinion that the
government ought to rely upon public oltlccrs
for the proper performance ol' their duties, with?
out stimulating them by any contingent advan?
tages. Ile recommends an increase ol' the sala?
ries or customhouse oin cc rs; and the abolition
of the system or giving to them a share or fines,
penalties and forfeitures will bc an additional
reason ror Hie Increase or salaries.
There are now 64 special agents In the service
of the department at a daily pay ur $,;?.;s ?5.
The organization of the special agents and as
slgnmeuts to districts is considered a good fea?
ture or the service. The Secretary gives con?
siderable ?paco to details concerning thc manu?
facture of government not s and bond paper in
Philadelphia, tho priutlng or money and bonds,

The depreciation of the currency is due to two
Canses-first, lo au excessive Issue, and. second?
ly, to thc want of faull in the government; and
ibu extent ol' the miliieno.! of the ilrst-named
cause cannot bc ascertained until the second is
removed substantially. Whenever our credit,
Shall be SO much improved at home and abroad
thal holders ol'our bonds are disposed to retain
them, even when the public mind is excited upon
Snanoiai subjects, wo shall be able to judge more
accurately Ute extent of the over-issue or paper
money. It is also true that the quantity ol'cur?
rency necessary for the transaction of the busi?
ness of the country cannot now bc (Ixed accurate?
ly. Since the close of Hie war the wants of the
Slates of the South have increased, and, conse?
quently, a large amount ol' currency has been
withdrawn from other sections to supply thc de?
mand lhere created. Tho amount necessary for
the purposes ol' thc South will steadily increase
ror thc next two years.
The construction ol'the Pacific Railroad ls likely
to result iu the Subsumtion o; paper tor com by
the peoplo on thc Cacilie coast, ll is probable
that the demand for paper for that purpose win
not be less than thirty millions ef do'lars. Asa
consequence a very large quantity or com will bc
withdrawn from circulation, and thus practically
the coin will lio Increased upon the At
coast, and the paper In circulation in State
of the Rocky mountains will be materia:
duced. These changes will tend to diinlnh
difference between paper und ?oin.
SPECIE BESUMITlON.
The ability of thc country to resume specii
incuts will not bc due to any special legis
upon that subject, but to thc condition of
dus tri es, and to Its financial relations to
countries. These, of course, will be more (
dependent ipon the general policy of the gc
ment. The war exhausted the country of it
terlal wealth, and the States of the South
Uteri* impoverished. A necessary oouditii
thc resumption of specie payments was tl
velopraent of the Industry of the nation,
South and Nen ii, and thc consequent accu
Hon of the movable produits of industry to
an extent that our exports ?f those pro
should bc equal substantially to our importi
long as lt ts necessary to pay for mercha
imported, by the transfer of government I
or other evidences of indebtedness to other
tries, so long will lt bc impracticable tu re
asd maiutain specie payments.
When the products of industry exported
be equal substantially to tho products of
countries imported, there will be no demai
specie for export, except what may arise
thc circumstance that our bonds held abroa
sent hume, sold in our markets, and the pro
exported In coln. Wbeu thc credit of the
try shall be fully established In Europe, and
shall bc no doubt either of our ability or dh
Mon to meet ali our obligations, bonds hcreti
and now to a large extent, held by mere
aud bankers, will be trauslerred to capitatis
permanent inveatmcut. When this change
have taken-place, thc probability of our seen
being sent home under the Influence of pol
or financial disturbances in Europe will be
slight; and when, ns a concurring fact, on
ports, exclusive of public securities, shall be
to our Imports, specie payments may be resi
without even a temporary embarrassment t
business of the country.
SHIPS AN KLEMENT OK STRENGTH.
One of thc most efficient means of streng
lng lae country lu it* financial relations
omer coumrleH 1- tue development ot our
merdai marine. The returns show that a
large amount of the foreign trade is iu Er
hands. We are net only thus dependent u]
rival country for the performance of the bus
which should be in the hands of our own pc
but our ability to maiutain specie paymei
materially diminished. If the entire foi
trade of the country, both of exports and
pons, were carried on in American ships
earnings would not be less than seventy-llv<
buns or dollars a year. At present the fre
of the foreign trade in American ships do nc
ceed twenty-eight millions of dollars. Wer
trade exclusively in Amcricau hands, a large
or this diiTereuce of forty-seven million of dc
would be due to citizens of thc United States,
payable In other countries.
This amount would be thus added to our al
to pay for goods imported from those count
If, for example, an American citizen pu rel:
In Xew York a thousand barrels of
lor six thousand dollars and export 1
Liverpool in an American vessel, and it ls t
sold for seven thousand dollars, a bill of exch
may be drawn against the proceeds.and an im
ol goods of t he value of seven thousand dollars
chased In England entirely liquidated, altin
at the customhouse at New York there woul
an apparent balance against thc country ol
thousand dollars. Hut if. on tlieother hand
thousaud barrels of flour are exported In a Ur
vessel, thc proceeds of the (lour realized In
York, and which can be applied to the paymei
goods bought lu England, wm bc only six tUom
dollars, and there will remain an actual bali
against Hie country ora thousand dollars,
familiar example shows thc Importance of r
tabllsUlng ?ur commercial supremacy upor
ocean. And I deem lt therefore essential tc
prosperity that the shipping interest of the G
try bo fostered, not only as a nursery fer seai
but also as an essential agency in enabling
government to institute and maiutain specie
meuts. It is au Interest also which, in its di
opinent, is as important to thc States and pc
remote trota thc seacoast as lt ls to the muri
sections. Every addition to our facilities foi
export of thc products of thc interior is as ad
tageous to the producers as to thc raercuauts
shipbuilders of Hie coast.
RESUMPTION OR REDUCTION.
While I do not uuilcipate thai it will bc necc
ry to delay resumption uutll our proper conn
dal position ls regained, I am satisfied thai
development or lb?: navigation and shipbuik
Interests will improve thc credit und rapidly i
ment the wealth or the country. Thc suggest
that I have made lndlsatc my opinion that lt
not be wise to resume specie payments wall
large a part of the interest-bearing debt of
country ls represented by ??-20 bonds, and heh
European merchants, bankers and manufue
ers. Questions that have been raised in re;
to thc nature of the obligation assumed by
Soverninent lu the issue of these bonds have
oubtedly deterred many persons from pure
iug them us a permanent investment, and co
quently they are largely held in this coontry
In Europe for speculative purposes by per.5
who design to put them upon thc market wi
ever the advance shall furnish a sufficient ind'
ment, or when political or financial disturbar
may create a demand for money or other j
poses.
It ts probable that from seven to nine bund
millions of these bonds arc now held In Euri
and, to a considerable extent, by persons i
will dispose of them under the Influencer
which I have referred. Such a panic as ext.
in Europe in ISM, at thc npeuiug of the Austi
and Prussian war, would be likely to induce
return of ii sufficient amount to this country
sale, to embarrass business, and, in case o'r
sumption, to cause the suspension of the han
lt is. therefore, in my judgment, essential t
the larger part of the live-twenty bonds be W
drawn, aud that oilier bonds bc substituted
their place, issued upon terms and condltl
which admit of no doubt. In fi. e, the pract
question is not merely the resumption of apt
payments, (as a raeusiiro by itself lt is net d
cull.) but the problem is to resume under si
circumstances lint thc position eau be ma
talned, not only In times of tranquillity, but t
In periods of excitement und peril.
Our course, it seems to me, is plain. Ev
measure of Hie government bearing upon
subject should tend to appreel tte the value of i
paper currency. It is probable that some
crease in the volume of paper will ultimately
necessary, and I. therefore, respectlully sug?
that the Secretary of tuc Treasury be doti
wiik authority io reduce the circulation of L'nl
States notes lu au amount liol exceeding two i
lion cf dollars iii .my ono month. Thus will
country be brought, gradually ii may be. und ,
without disaster, into a condition wticti the
sumption of specie payments WlU bc easy, If i
unavoidable.

UNITED STATES NOTES AND RON PS.
On the 1st of December, isco. the principle
the peinic debt ol' the United state's, not dedu
lng bonds and cash on baud, amounted to j
flui>,-Js6,7sy sj. Ofthls amount, th?: sum of $:g
113,23860 ia represented by United States no
net bearing interest. The larger part of un?
needed for circulation, but the amount can
reduced, from the ordinary revenue of the cou
try, if Congress shall consider it expedient
make provision for such reduction. The fractlc
al currency in circulation was $3S,SS5,6(U 6s, a;
there ls no occasion for any legislation In ref
ence to this item of Hie public debt. There wc
outstanding, also, certificates for gold deposit
in the treasury to the amount ol' ?JO.S?-.*,94K. T
certificates are redeemable on preseniutto
These ihre-.: items amount in Hie aggregate
$431.601,703 is, and lu making provision for t
public debi Ikey are nul necessary to be co
Hidered.
Un the loan of .lanuary 1, 1861. the sam
$7,02-\ooo is outstanding und payable on the l
of January, 1871. The loan ol'is.'.s, of $'JO,O0o,0i
is payable in 1873. The bonds known as tett-l'or
bonds, amounting to 8194,507,300, are not pay
ble until 1874. Thc six percent, bonds, payan
In 1881, amount to $283,077,600. As the bom
known us eighty-ones and ten-forties,amountlr
in the aggregate to $478,244,900, are not due an
cannot be paid previous to 157-1 and 1861. lt is Ul
necessary to consider them ia making provista
for a new loan. The Ore-twenty bonds, ameun
lng in the aggregate to $1,002,671,130, are cathi
iiue, or wiii soon become due, and lt is to iii
class of tis- public debt, and lo this class alan
thai attcntloD should be directed.
c?f this amount the sum of .$75,477,800 has bee
purchased since March last, and thc bonds ar
now held by the government. Before any mea
uro for funding thc are-twenty bonds can be coi
sutntuaied lite goveromeui will be able to pu
chase at least $75,000,000 more. There will the
remain, on the first of July next, about Sl.460.ouu
ooo of Ute five-twenty bonds in the hands of tb
public creditors, m tao entire Indebtedness <
the United States only thc unimportant sum t
*v.7.0im,00y will be due and payable previous t
1874.
PONDING TUE PIVE-TWENTIES.
Under these circumstances. >t docs net .seem t
me to be wine t.? authorize the funding of th
whole amount of the live-twenty bends, which
as is now anticipate.!, will be outstanding on th
1st id' July next, bul that 32?A000,000 at lesli
should bc suffered to remain either for purehas
or redemption previous to 1874. Should the sun
of $250,000,000 be left for Hut purpose, the cutir
public debt would be in a condition to be cosllj
redeemed. Uetween lS74aud issi, the ten-fort;
bonds c- ni l bc paid, and provision also made ru?
the redemption or the bonds which will becomi
due In inc year issi. It may be wisc torcduci
the imposed luau to $1,000,000,000, which wouli
then leave the payment previous to l^si ihc sun
of 5t'i7o,000,oo), or hardly more than $tW.uoo,ooo i
year.
Asi-nralng that the proposed loan will be fsr ar
amount not exceeding $1,200^)00^000, 1 recan?
mend that il lie offered in three classes of $400,
OOO.'K o caoh. The first class or 3400.000.00.1 to u.
partible in fifteen years, and to bo paid in twentj
yeats. Tho second class of stuo.ooo.oooto be pay
abie in twenty'.ears, and lo be paid i t twenty
five years. The third class of $40O.oto,C0? tu b;
payable lo twenty-five years, am] to be paid in
thirty years.
The essential conditions ol" the new loan appear
to me to be these:
l3t. That the principal and interest shall be
made pavable in coin.
2d. That the bof?ds known as the tlve-f wenty
bonds shall be received in exchange for tho new
bonds.
3d. Thar thc principal be payable in this coun?
try, and the interest payable either in the United
States or in Europe, as t?e subscribers to the loan
may desire.
4th. That thc rate of interest shall not exceed
4.ij per cent, per annum.
.oth. That the subscribers in Europe shall re?
ceive their interest at London, Paris, Harlin, or
Praukfort, aa they may elect.
(Uh. That thc bonds, both principal and interest,
shall be free from all taxes, deductions, or abate?
ments of any sort, unless lr. sha ! be tnought wise
to subject citizens of tho United States to such
tax upon income from the bouds as ls imposed by
the laws pf the United States upon Income de?
rived frorfl other money investments.
There are two reasons, and each seems to me to
be a controlling reason, why the bonds of
the United States should be exempt from State
and local taxes. If not so exempt, the amount of
the taxes Imposed by the local authorities will be
added to thc interest thc government will be re?
quired to pay. and thus the national government
will be compelled to provide Tor taxes Imposed by
the local authorities.
Secondly, inasmuch as the ability to borrow
money may, under some circumstances, bc es
senilal to the preservation of the government,
the power should not, even in times of peace aud
prosperity, be qualified by any concession to the
States of the right to tax the means by which the
national government Ls maintained. The right
u use Its lawful powers free of any condition,
restriction or claim of another, is an essential
condition of sovereignty, and the national gov?
ernment should never surrender or qualify its
powers in this particular.
THU MEW LOAM.
In offering thc new loan, citizens and subjects
of other governments should receive the strong?
est assurauce that the interest and principal arc
to bc paid In coin, according to the terms of the
bend? Issued, without auy deduction or abate?
ment whatsoever.
In order to avoid the necessity of employing
agents for the negotiation or the loan, 1 respect?
fully recommend that a liberal commission be al?
lowed to subscribers, and that, those who first
subscribe be permitted to select Die class ul
bonds in which their subscription respectively
shall bc made. I f urt lier recommend, in connec?
tion with the proposed loan, that the banks es?
tablished nndor "thc act to provide a national
currency" be required to substitute the bonds that
may be Issued under the proposed loan act foi
those now deposited as security for the redemp?
tion of their bills. Should any bank be unwilling
to accept the new condition, provision should be
made for the surrender of its charier, and au?
thority given ror the organization of new banks
to supply thc deficiency thus created.
An essential condition to the success of the pro?
posed new loan, Ls the continuance ot" thc present
revenue system. A chief means by which the
present holders of the five-twenty bonds can in;
induced to surrender them, and receive a bond
upon longer time aud at a lower rate of Interest,
is thc certainty furnished by the magnitude oi
thc national revenue, that these bonds ara soon
to bc redeemed. We must be prepared tj offer
them thc alternative, either of accepting tie new
bond at a lower rate of interest, or payment nf the
principal ortbe existing bond. When the five-twen?
ty bonds shall have been funded to the amount
of $1,000,000,000 or $1,200,000,000, the reven?
ues can be reduced materially, and yet sufficient
sums be raised to "nv-cr thc ordinary expenses of
the government, to pay the interest on the public
debt, and also to pay $20,00J,000 to - $.00,000,000 or
the principal annually.
Should our success in negotiating a new loan
1 be eqnul to ray expectations, based upon the rael
that the ability and disposition or the peuple ol
the United States to pay the public debt aro sulll
! clent to justify us in assuming that the bonds ul
the United States will command thc highest ratet
lu the markets or the world, we shall then be ia u
condition to enter upon the work or reducing tax
! ation at thc commencement or the next session
i o f Congress.
RKDEMPTIOK OK TUREE PER CENT. CERTIFICATES.
On the ruth of June, 1603, the amount of out
standing three per cent, certificates and com
pound interest notes convenible Into three pei
cent, certificates was $71,604,890. Ou the tioth ol
June, 1SC9, thc amount outstanding was $54,091,
' 410, showing a reduction of $16,013,4S0 Lu thai
, form or indebtedness.
On tlie 1st or December, 1809, the amount out
'. standing was still further reduced to $40,710,130
i showing a total reduction, In seventeen months
or $21,s?8,740.
The three per cent, certificates are a substitute
; to a considerable extent, for United States notes
being largely held by thc banks as a portion o
? their reserve, and thus indirectly, though not ti
! their rail nominal value, they swell the volume 0
' currency.
I recommend that provision be made fer there
demptlou or the three per cent, certificat vs wlthir
?' a reasonable time; and, as a compensating meas
, ure ror thc reduction in thc amount or currencj
which would thus be caused, that authority bi
given to grant charters ror banks lu the State:
" where the banking capital is less than the shan
to which they would be entitled, toan amouutuo
exceeding thirty-five millions or dollars in thi
I aggregate. The redemption oi the three per cent
eeriillcaies and the additions to the bankingcapl
! tal might be so arranged as not to produce a seri
ons disturbance In thc finances or business of tin
. country, while additional banking capital wouh
be supplied to the sections now in need of it, an.
I this without auy increase or thc volume or slrcu
. latlon.
_ BANKING EVILS.
There are two evils in the present banking sys
[ tem which require remedy by prompt and elli
cicnt legislar ion. The first is the practice on tin
part or uanks or allowing Interest upon deposits
The effect ol this practice is that monies in Hu
hands of individuals, which otherwise might b<
loaued for regular mercantile and other business
purposes, are diverted luto the custody of banks
upon (he idea that, if thc security is not liettcr
payment eau bc obtained at a uoaient's notice.
Country batiks, and others remote rrom tin
large centres or t rattle, having received money 01
deposit Tor which they pay interest, are anxlou
t.i transfer such funds io other banks, rrom whlcl
they will receive au equal or larger rate orin
terest in return. They are stimulated also bj
the desire to place their runt's where they cai
be ni all times commanded. Thus influenced
large sums are placed on deposit with banks il
the cities, especially iu thc eily of New York
which ls the gr?ai centre or trade and finance foi
the Atlantic coast, lu the ordinary cour?e 01
trade thc currency or thc country tends rapidlj
to the cities, and it, is unwise tu stimulate tul:
tendency by artificial means.
lint the evil does not end with the impoverish
ntcnt Of the country. As the banks in the eitle
may be called upon at any moment to respond ti
thc drarts or their depositors, they decllue ti
make loans representing such funds upon com
murial paper payable on time, bul insist upoi
making call loans, as they arc termed, with gov
crnmcnlbonds er ether obligations pledged a:
collateral security. Merchants generally will no
borrow money in large sums payable upon dc
mund. The consequence Ls that thc monies thu.
accumulated In the city banks are loaned io per
sons engaged in speculative pursuits.
The extent or this evil is seen In the ract that
or the bank loans In the city of New York in Oe
tober, 1868, $:i8,ooo,oeo were upon commercial pa
per aud $Hb,t>ou.oou upon demaud, with a pledgi
or collaterals; ?iud in October, 1S69, $96,000,ooi
were upon commercial papar and $56,ooo,ooo 11 poi
demand. In thc former year 41 per cent., and li
thc latter year ;?7 per cent., of the loans mase bj
the New York banks were upon demand.
A further result ls seen in the fact that partie:
borrowing money upon commercial paper ror legit
lu?ate commercial purposes pay rrom three to si:
per cent, additional Interest per annum ae compar
cd with persons who borrow money forspuculativi
purposes, i therefore respectfully r^comuien?
thai a law We passed prohibiting absolutely thi
payment of iritere.-i by batiks upon deposits, am
limiting also their loans upon collaterals to ai
amount not, exceeding ten per cent, of theil
capita!.
1 um sal ?siled, also, that the practice of certify
ittg checks, even when ronds arc in H.e bank t<
l?e credit or thu drawer ol* tito check, ?H fraBgh
with evil, and thai it ougm lo be sntlre'y pro
