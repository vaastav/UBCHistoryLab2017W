shall cease niiti' tho amount held hy
the Government again equals such
reserve. Another plan would bo to

then the purchase of bullion should

lie Discusses the message nud
Opposes lis Proposition*.
New York, December 7.—The Tri
bune to-morrow will contain a long in
terview with Hon. James G. Blame
on President Cleveland's message.
He save: "i havo been reading an ah
stractof the President's message, and
have been especially interested in the
comments of the London papers.
Those papers all declare that the
rr>eS*aa*S is a free-trade manifesto, and
evidently are anticipating an enlarged
market for English fabri s in tlie
United States markets as a conse
quence of the President's recommen
dations. Perhaps that fact stamps the
character of the message more clearly
than any words can.
'• fou don't mean actual free Irade
without diry?" queried the repoiter.
'■No," repl ed Blame. "Nor do the
London papers iican that; they
simply mean that the President has
recommended what in the United
States is known as the revenue tariff,
rejecting tlie protective feature and
not even permitting protection to re
sult freely as incidental totiic revenue
duties."
•T don't know tied I quite compre
hend that last part?" said the re
porter
"I mean," said Blaino, "that for
tho first time in the history of the
lb ited Slates tlie President recom
mends retaining internal tax iv order
that the tariif may be forced down
even below a fair revenue standard.
He recommends that th- tax on to
ll.ceo be retained and thus that many
millions annually shall be levied on
domestic products which would f.r
better come from ta itl" on foreign
fabrics."
"Then do you mean to imply lhat
you would lavor a repeal of the to
bacco tax V"
"Certainly, 1 mean just that," said
Mr. BI d c. "I should urge that it be
done at once, even before the Christ
mas hulidavs. It would, iv tlie lirst
place, bring a great relief to growers
of tobacco all over the country, and
would, moreover, materially lessen
Ihe price of tobacc >to consumers.
Tobacco to millions of men is a
necessity. Tne P esident calls
it a luxury. It is well to remem
ber that ibe luxury of yester
day becomes a necessity of to-day.
Watch the number of men ad work on
f unis, In cod mines along the rail
roads, iv iron foundries, or in any call
ing, and you will Hud 03 out of 100
chewing while they work. Alter each
uieal the sa i>e p oporti n reek solace
iv a pipe or cigar. These men not
only pay millions in tobacco lax,'out
pa. an eiih uiee.l price, which price
the tax enables the manufacturer and
retailers to impose. The only excuse
for such a tax is the uctual necessity
under which iho government fcj nd
itself dining the war and the year*
immediately following. To retaiu the
tax ROW in order to destroy pro
lection, which wou'd Incidentally
follow iron, rai-ing the sa . c amount
of money on foreign imports, is a most
extraordinary policy fur our govern
ment."
"Well, then, Mr Blame, would you
advisee reieal of the w bisk v tax?"
"No, I would not. Oilier ens del
ation* I han tbo-e of financial admin
istration are to be taken into account
»ith regard to whi-ky. There is a
moral side to it. To cheapen w j
is to increase the c> nsump'ion
enormously. There would be lb
sense in urging Ihe reform wrought j
by high license in many states, if ibe
National Government neutral zes lie
good effect by making whisky within |
the reach of every one, at twenty
cents a gallon. It would destroy
high license at once in all Ihe States
Whisky has done a vast deal oi harm
in the United States. I would try to
make it do some good, I would uso
the tax to fortify our cities,
on tho seaboard. In view of the pow
erful letter addressed to tbe Demo
cratic party on the subject of fortifi
cations by Samuel J. Tiltten in 1885,
I am amazed that no attention lias
been paid to the subject by the Dem
ocratic administration. Never in the
history of the world has any iiovern
ment allowed groat cities on the sea
board to remain defenseless.

Blame Interviewed Regarding
the President's Message—
His Opinions.
1 Associated Press iiisimteiiesto the Herald
WASHINGTON, December 7. — The
Secretary of the Treasury, iii his an
nual report, submitted to Congress to
day, says lhat the total ordinary re
ceipts of the Government during the
year ending .lutie 30, 1887, were $37! ,
-40.! 000, and the total ordina y ex
penditures $315,835,000, leaving with
the amount drawn from the cash b.il
unco in the Treasury, $24 445 000
a total surplus of $80 033 000,
which w as available for the redemption
of bonds. Receipts for the year show
an increase of 1134,083,000 over the
year before, and tn expenditures an
"increase of $-'5,449,000.
Eor the present year the revenues
aro estimated at $883 000 000, and ex
pendituies (318.817,000. leav in/an es
timated surplus of $88,182,000 on
June HO, 1888. Tlie Secretary esti
mates the sui plus for tho year 1889 at
$56,409,000.
REMERIES FOR RELIEF.
Tlie. Secretary says that the urgency
of the question of surplus of revenue
is so great that it should demand the
attention of both executive branches
of tbe government. The. Secretary
mentions Ibe follow ing ways in which
the receipts and expenditures of the
government may be equalized :
first— Purchase of the interest bear
ing debt of the government.
Second —Larger expenditures hy the
government for other p up s.-s than
purchase of bonds, so that they shall
each year equal the taxes of that year.
Third —Reduction of revenue from
taxation to the amount actually re
quired to meet necessary expenses.
All these expedients have in common
the one merit of preventing derange
ment to business, which must follow
the hoarding or locking up in the
treasury nf the circulating medium of
the people.
EXPEDIENTS DISCUSS!. I.
In re gar I to the first plan he agrees
with what ihe President in bis mes
sage said on the same subject.
The Secretary I ben says: "I can
not believe that Congress will adoit
the second expedient, and advise the
enlargement of Government expenses
simply to expend the money raised
by taxation when tho public weal
does not otherwise call for expendi
tures.
The reduction of the revenue from
taxation is the only tit remedy for the
evils which Uneaten the country.
This may be BCeompllehed by various
ways; one is to reduce or abolish in
ternal revenue taxation audio favor of
til in is (lie fact, that in a small part of
the Southern Mates the internal tax on
liquor nnd tobacco is thought to be
oppressive and is odious to Ihe people
of these sections, and tlie further fact
that by its reduction the expenses of
its collection might be somewhat re
duced.
Till! CHIEF CAUSE FOB PREJUDICE
Against this tax seems to bo hit
there was no such tax before the war
for the Union and it is 1 inked upon as
a reminder of the measures adopted
to raise money to carry on tbe war
and which ought not to be continued
in time of peace. As to the expense of
Collecting the internal revenue I sug
gest, that the amalgamation of the
customs and internal revenue systems
is entirely feasible and I earnestly
commend this suggestion to tho care
ful consider.iiion oi Congress. To do
away with the Wbole revenue from
internal taxes at pre ent would ill
minish the revenues so that it would
be necesSiry either to lay duties on
articles of importation now free or to
suspend the sinking fund require
ments and also materially diminish
the other expenses of the government.
But it is not well either to abolish or
reduce the lateral revenue taxation.
It is Iho tax upon whisky, beer and
tobacco which I think is in a very
small measure necessary to the health
or happiness of mankind. This tax is
less burdensome and
THE LEAST UNJUST
Of all the taxes which tho govern
ment lays or cm lay u,>on the people,
and it should not be abolished.
There is left only the revenue from
QllStOtn taxation to bo considered.
Here is wh re a reduction should he
made; and while reducing, advan
tage should be taken of the oppor
tunity to reform the abuses and
Inequalities of the tariff law s, to add
to the free list as many articles as
possible, and to reduce the duties on
every dutiable artielo to tbe lowest
point piss hie. But in ascertaining
these possibilities, the present situa
tion of labor and business must al ways
bo kept in mind.
AS TO THE PRESENT BUBPLUS.
After the question of the annual sur
plus of revenues is disposed of, there
still remains a surplus of money
Which is in tlie treasury to be con
sidered. This surplus amounted on
December 1 to $65,288 000, and will
probably amount to about $140,000,000
on Ihe 30th of Juno next. One uso
which can he made of this money is
to diminish taxation to such an ex
tent that the annual revenue will tie
less for some years to come than the
appropriation. A portion of thi
money could lie in tbe hanks, where
it would be available for the business
of the country, and I advise this
course. If, however, it is thought
better to attempt to buy bonds with
it, I should like to have special
authority given tho Secretary of the
Treasury to do so
THE SILVER QUESTION,
The report shows that the circula
tion of standard silver dol'ars has
increased $10,465,000 during the past
yoar. In regard to this tho Secretary
says: One of the most interesting
facts shown by the foregoing state
ment is the decrease in tne number of
standard silver dollars owned by tho
government, and tho increased use of
the same money by people in the
form of silver certificates, and it is
evident that the future use of silver
dollars will be almost exclusively in
that form. The law should be so
"But," sail the reporter, "you
don't think we are to havo war in any
direction ?"
"Certainly not; but we should
change the remote chance into an
absolute im ossibdity."
"But would not our fortifying now
possibly leek as if wo expected war?"
"Why should it any more than the ,
fortifications made by our grand
fathers? They guarded themselves
against successful attacks from arma
ments In that day. We do not neces
sarily expect burglars because we lock
our tloor at night."
"But after the fortification construc
tions, would you still maintain tlie tax
ou wlil-ky?"
"Yes; so long as there is whisky to
tax it, and when the national govern
ment should have no use for the
THUUSDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 8, 1887.-TEN PAGES.
money I would divide tlie tax among
to federal Union with the specific
object of lightening the tax on real
es'ate. If ultimate relief could be
given in that direction, in my judg
ment it would be a wise and beneficial
policy."
' liesides your general and sweeping
opposition to the President's recom
mendation have you any further speci
fic objections?"
"Yes," answered Mr. Blame. "I
shold seriously object to the repeal of
the duty on wool as that repeal would
work great Injustice to many interests,
and would seriously discourage whet
we »hou d earnestly encourage,namely,
sheep culture among the farmers
throughout the Union. To break
down wool gT'iwing and bn depend
ent on foreign Countries for the blank
ets under which we sleep and the
coat that covers ■ur back is not a
wise policy for the national govern
ment to enforce.
"Do you think that the question of
labor underlies the w hole subject
"Of course it. does," replied Mr.
Blame, "it is tbe entire question.
Whenever we can force carpenters,
masons. Iron-workers ami mechanics
in every department fo work as cheap
ly and live as poorly in the United
States as similar workmen in Europe,
we can, of com so, manufacture just
as cheaply as they do in Engl md
and franco; but I am totally
opposed to the policy that
would entail such results. The
moment you begin to import freely
from Europe you drive our own
workmen f oin mechanical and manu
facturing pur-uits. In tne same pro
portion they become tillers of tho soil,
increasing steadily the agricultural
products and decreasing steadily the
iari-e home demand, which is con
stantly enlarging as home manufac
tures enlarge.

Healers Anxious That They
Should He Retain it.
A conference of wool growers and
wool dealers of the United States to
day unanimously adopted a resolution
in which it is stated that the Presi
dent's message is a direct attack upon
their imbi-try, representing a capital
of $500,000,000, and 1,000,000 wool
growers and wool dealers, and a direct
vl latum of the Democratic platform
of 1884. The policy of protection
brought about the country's unexam
pled prosperity and development.
Abolishing the w<> 1 dut es reduces
tbe surplus only $5,000,000, while the
President recommends the retc tion
of the war taxes, yieldingsllo.ooo.ooo
Under the tariff uf 18fi7 tho revenue
from wool was ij 1 700,000, and under
the reduction taiitt" of 1883 the rev

about 50.600 000, and in 1887 about'

the tariif reduction increased tlie rev

San Diego, December 7. —The
Union publishes to-morrow, an opin
ion on tbe title of the International
Company of Mexico, to lands iv Lower
California. The opinion hoi Is that
tho grant was re. eived by indefeasi
ble title in fee from tbe Mexican gov
ernment subjee only tothe condition
that about 3000 families shall be set
lled'on or before June 21st, 1889. The
opinion as to the title and rights oi
tho col mists is by Fred
erick Hall. This opinion re
cites tbe history of the contracts by
the Mexican government with the In
ternational Company, which contracts
aro subject to the colonisation law
of Mexico, dated December 15,
1883, and pronounced all titles
issued by the Mexican executive
pursuant io contracts, to be regular
and valid. The only condition of
coloniz dion is that a certain number
o families shall be settled on tbe land
within a specified lime, and a failure
to fulfill the condition only affects the
company and uot the colonists.

Asiatic Commerce.
I Associated Press Dispatches to the Herald.
San Francisco, De ember 7. —Col-
onel Mendell saving made the pre
liminary examination required in sec
lion 6, River and Harbor Act of Aug
ust 5, 1888, recommends to the Chief
Engineer of tbe United States navy
it Washington, a survey of San Pedro
bay, substantially as follows: Speak
ing of tbe harbors of the California
••oast, lie states that it is well known
lhat there are only two harbors for
leep -ea vessels, -an Francisco and
San Diego, the distance between them
being GOO miles. San Pedro bay is the
best, the most known roadstead and
the only one with foreign commerce,
iho imports being mainly coal and
he exports wheart During the year
1885 ami 1886, about 101 500 duties
acre collected at the Wilmington cus
tom hou-e.
railroad accommodation.
The Southern Paci c Railroad sys
tem coming irom tlie East first touches
ihe Pacific Coast at San Pedro, a much
shorter and easier line of overland
transportation for Asiatic commerce
than San Francisco. Tlie loading and
departing of deep water shi. s is now
effected through the latter by ca try ing
die freight for two or three miles be
i ween the shore and the vessels at an
chorage. This commerce is taxed by
ihe cost o' trans-shipment, and tbe de
lay imposed upon vessels and it is
therefore" not probable that As atic
commerce could take this route until
the s ipscau lie and discharge along
-ide of the piers. Heretolore San
c'ranci-co alone has received the
Asiatic trade. Now the Canadian Pa
cific is already operating and the
Northern Pacini-is iv course of exten
-ion to Puget Sound. There is prom
ise of two com(ietitors for the over
land transportation of Asiatic com
merce between San Francisco and Los
tngeles. Two considerable moun
tain elevations have to be crosss I and
the distance is about 50 I miles. It
woulJ appear that San Pedro's ad
vantage over San Francisco in over
land competition is something like
cOO miles.
SAN DIEGO'S ADVANTAGES.
The harbor of San Diego is capacious
and favorable in point of shelter and
depth f r any amount of commerce.
It lies ninety miles to the southward
and eastward.of the bay of San Pedro.
Perhaps it is a que tion whether it is
advisable to expend a considerable
-urn building an artificial harbor at
Sau Pedro with ti fine natural harbor
at Sail Diego S m Pedro has advan
tages in the light grades found on its
rail nay route from tlie coa tto San
Bernar lino. Coa-ting commerce is
now practically cairied on through
a ihuington harbor, which can never
be made a harbor for deep water
ships. The ex stance of a large coast
commerce tends to attract to this point
foreign com nene. The sum of $4000
is fixed as tho cost of the urvev and
project. In any event, it is hoped
lhat not less than $2500 will be al
loted.
