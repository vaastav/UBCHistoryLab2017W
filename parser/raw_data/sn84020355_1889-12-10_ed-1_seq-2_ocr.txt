County Official Paper.
SECRETARY WINDOM ON SIL
VER.
The Secretary of the Treasury has
presented a report in which he
recommends that the Mints of the
United States be opened for the free
deposit of silver, the market value of
the same (not to exceed $1 for 412^
grains of standard silver) to be puid
in treasury notfcs. Said notes to be
redeemable in the quantity of silver
which could be purchased by the
number of dollars expressed on the
face of the note at the time it was
presented for payment, or in gold at
the option of the government.
If the price of silver should advance
between the date of the issue of the
note and its payment the holder of
the note would receive a less quantity
of silver than he deposited; but if the
price of silver should decline the
holder of the note would not receive
more silver than he deposited. This
proposition is unfair on its face, for
while the holder of the note would be
compelled to stand an advance in the
price of silver he would not have the
advantage of a decline; and as can
l>e readily seen gold is to be the
standard in all transactions, and sil
ver takes the place of a mere com
modity in the markets.
This is the plan which President
Harrison suys "seems to satisfy the
purpose to continue the use of silver
in connection with our currency,"
and obviates the danger which he
foresees would follow either free coin
age or any considerable increase of
the present rate of coinage.
It is clear that the silver men are
to be arrayed against the combined
forces of the administration, the
Speaker of the House of Representa
tives, the National Banks and Wall
street with its combination of bond
holders* hence we fear that but little
in favor of the white metal will be
accomplished during the present
session of Congress. But he who
hesitates is lost, and the friends of
silver should put on a bold front,
stand firm to the cause of free coin
age, make no compromise with the
enemy, and in the ond victory will
l>eroh upon our banners. The people
will eventually awake to their own
interests and in spite of the Presi
dent's message, in spite of Windom's
cunning theories, in spite of the com
bined powers of Wall street capitalists
und National bankers they will de
mand in thunder tones that will take
no denial, the return of silver to the
position to which it naturally belongs
us the money of the people.
Adamantine Cheek.
The English financiers keep a oloBe
watch of affairs on this side of the
water. When?some time ago ?it wua
reported that the full limit of $4,000,
000 a month in silver was likely to be
coined, the white metal advanced in
prioe in Iiondon. The President's
message reassured the Londoners and
a drop in silver followed. Free coin
age of Bilver in the United States
would he a bitter pill for the English
to swallow just now when they have
got everything working so charmingly
Imtweon their little island and India.
?[Virginia Enterprise.
And yet the Itepublioan press, the
Enterprise not excepted, has had the
supreme effrontery to claim that the
Demooratio party is the party that
favors British interests and enter
prises, but now the admission is
iraukly made that President Harri
son is the friend of British capital
in his hostility to silver. Vur.ly the
world do move.
THE THIBETAN WOMAN.
An IndapmdMt ud Bum Dmaam, Wad
Kall IMI Btordjr.
A point to be noticed here is the free
dom with which women of nil grades go
about from plaoe to place; in the shops,
in the streets, in the vaulted entries
which give access to every dwelling
house. The Thibetan female is an inde
j pendent and buxom dame, very unlike
I her Hindoo sister across the border. Her i
t frame is well-knit and sturdy; she oan
carry any weight you like on her back.
Moreover, there is a jollity about her
smile and general deportment which
would be very engaging if she made her
self a little better acquainted with the
wash-bowl. Though she rarely uses
water for ablutionary purposes, the
black stains which oover the Thibetan
woman's face are not due to dirt. It is
custom, said to be founded on a strict
law enacted two hundred years ago, for
all the adult females to stain their faces
with blotches of a black dye styled tuvja.
This disfigurement, which originally
was ordered for the purpose of
subduing the natural attractiveness
of the female face to the other
sex, forms almost a complete dis
I guise to the countenance. In reality a
I Thibetan girl's face is most oomely and
nretty Before the blackening process
her cheeks are as pioturesquely ruddy as
any Scotch lassie's, and, as the pigment
wears off, the ripe wall-fruit glow whioh
the keen mountain air insists on pro
ducing is continually to be seen over
coming the sooty patohes. Higher-class
Thibetan vomen frequently traverse
mo du ooui ui xj uooaa uu gmau wniH)
horses, seated astride the animars back.
They generally have intellectual faoes,
and are often in truth highly educated
and learned. Every better-class female
in the streets of L'hassa wears a head
| dress called a pa-tuk, not unlike an old
1 fashioned English traveling cap, with
' long, turned-down ear flaps. This is
often studded with turquois and pieces
of coral; sometimes, in the case of a wife
of a State Chancellor (Kalon), with em
eralds, ruhies and pearls. Its use is
very ancient. Another characteristic
part of the women's dress is the bib or
breast cover, styled pangdau ? Nine
teenth Century.

HIS LITTLE MAJESTV.
Some Pleasant Stories About the Babjr
Klnff of Spain.
It would probably be hotly disputed
by millions of indignant households
if one should say that the little three
year-old King of Spain is the best-be
lovod baby under the eye of public
notice, but of a certainty ho is the most
widely known. All his sayings and
doings are sufficiently interesting to bo
put in print, and those who love babies
smile as they read, and declare, with
gracious tolerance, that he is "almost as
nice a baby as ours.'*
The little King has had a happy sum
mer at San Sebastian, where he enjoys
moro freodum than at Madrid. Every
I morning at eight o'clook he stops out on
! the baloony of the royal chateau, where
crowds of children wait for him to ap
! pear. Many of them he knows by name, '
and, leaning over the railing, he car
ries on the quaintest and most familiar
I of conversations with them all. Pres- j
ently a little tap is heard on the win
dow and his Majesty retires, crying:
" Adioa au retoir/ 1 must go. Mamma is
waiting for me." |
Shortly after ho appears on tho sands.'
where he digs and paddles to his heart's
| content.

side the stairs and, as soon as he is seat- 1

??Let them retire."
Evidently young royalty is prone to
forget the restrictions of time and place
? as completely as children not bound
; about by ceremony,
i General Juan de Cordova is a great
favorite of the little King, who ad-!
dresses him familiarly as "Juanito*
(little John). One day while seated be
side his mother at mass his Majosty,
caught sight of this friend kneeling in j
the nave of the cathedral, and at onoe,
aoild one of tho solemn pauses, ho be
gan to shout with great gloe:
"Hello, there's Juniatol Hello, there,
1 Juanito! Juanito!"
It was only with great difficulty that
*,he Queen and his govornesA could re
luce this enthusiastic little partisan to
tllenoe.?Youth's Companion.
