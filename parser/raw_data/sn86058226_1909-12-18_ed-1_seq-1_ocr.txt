Thinks It Should Merge
With Young Men's Business

(T WOULD BE DECIDED
BENEFIT TO RICHMOND
Commercial Club Executive
Points Out That a Modern
Club House Could Be Se
cured for the Members.
"A consolidation between the Com
mercial club and the Young Men's
Business club would be of everlasting
benefit to the city of Richmond.
. am greatly in favor of bringing about a
union between these two organizations,
believing that inasmuch as they both
work for the civic interests of the city,
the combination would prove to be of
exceptional advantage. I will exert
every influence to accomplish the un
ion."
In this manner spoke John F. Mc
Carthy, president of the Commercial
Club, rhen asked this morning what
he thought of a Business Mien's Organ
izatlon for Richmond along lines simi
lar to those in other cities in the state.
Mir. McCarthy stated that such action
had been contemplated for some time
and that he was greatly in favor of
such a movement. In suggesting that
the two clubs unite Mr. McCarthy rec
ommended the purchase of a large club
house, where the various features of
dub life might be observed.
Quarters Are Too Small.
The present quarters of the Commer
clal club in the Masonic temple are
entirely inadequate for its needs, ac
cording to Mr. McCarthy. The hall 's
much too small and when prominent
speakers address the club, the number
of invited guests is very limited, ow
ing to lack of room. Frequently the
. Coliseum has to be. used. .JBylhe,
- erection tj a clubTiouse, it is said,
along the plan, suggested, there wouH
be an abundance of room and other
disagreeable phases would be eliminat
ed. Mr. McCarthy paid a high, tribute to
the Young Men's Business club for its
excellent work during the Fall Festival
and commended the young men upon
the spirit and enterprise shown. He
stated that the young men were gradu
ally assuming the lead and holding the
reins of the civic interests of the city.
He declared that their Judgment in af
fairs, which heretofore had been left
In the hands of the Commercial club,
was of untold value. "It is the young
men with the new ideas who are going
to boom things for Richmond." assert
ed Mr. McCarthy, "and It is for this
reason that I favor a merger between
the old and the new organization.
There can never be, too many ideas
suggested on any proposition."
Has Proven a Success.
The idea of forming a Business
Men's Organization has been tried with
great success at Muncie, Connersville
and many other cities over the state.
All of the members of the local Com
mercial club look with decided favor
on the proposed movement, it is said,
realizing that "in union there is
strength," while the members of the
Young Men's Business club regard the
proposition, it is stated as an excellent
one and are perfectly willing to coun
tenance such a proceedure.
Probably no action will be taken in
the matter until the first of the year.
The proposition will be more fully dis
cussed, although its advisability is now
apparent, it is said, and no difficulty
in bringing about the union is antici
pated, as the relations between the two
organizations have always been most
friendly.
LONG CHASE ENDED
New Orleans, Dec. 18. Pinkerton
detectives today have in custody John
I. Collins, said to be one of the most
daring and expert forgers alive, after a
chase clear across the continent. Col
lins is said to have victimized several
banks In different parts of the couu
try. He is alleged to have operated in
Denver last July. His rooms contain
ed one of the most complete forger's
outfits ever taken, say the Pinkertons.

And People Are Hunting for
Proper Official to Make
Complaints To.

OLDEST JIN H ABjTANT, $H AK E
THEIR HEADS AND PREDICT
THAT WAYNE COUNTY IS IN
FOR A LONG SIEGE.
There are hundreds of persons who
would like to learn the name of the
official, to whom complaint should be
registered about the weather, which,
this winter, promises to be extremely
low in temperature and unusually se
vere. Winter descended in this com
munity long before it was anticipat
ed and this morning for a second time
this month, the official thermometers
showed that the temperature was but
3 degrees above zero.
Winter, this year, has been getting
in its best licks much earlier than
usual and in the memory of the oldest
residents, there have been few past
seasons which have been its equal.
As a rule the severe cold weather
does not make its appearance until
after the first of the year. However,
there is a change of program this year
which fact will be attested to by ev
ery citizen, especially those in charge
of the charitable institutions where
demands by the poor for assistance
have been heavy.
A Sun Dog Sign.
The sun dogs were particularly
clear about 9 and 10 o'clock today and
had not entirely disappeared at noon,
when the sun was its brightest. This
was only one indication, of extreme
ly cold weather. Frost bites would
be in order if anyone would spend
much time outside without heavy pro
tection from exposure.
There are but few joys to be ex
perienced from such weather, and the
small boy expects to come in for a
good share of these. The principal
attraction to him is the fact that
skating will be exceptionally fine dur
ing the holidays. The coal dealers are
not complaining and the ice men are
afraid that there will be a sudden re
vision upwards in the weather, which
will effect the possibilities of a splen
did yield of natural ice.
TO POOL HOLDINGS

Pittsburg, Pa., Dec. 18. Sharehold
ers of the Pittsburg Coal company,
will today receive a circular from that
corporation in which they will be
asked to pool their holdings for a per
iod of four years in a voting trust in
order that control of the company may
rest in Pittsburg, and to prevent it
from becoming the property of the
parties, said to be the Penna., Balto

past six months have been buying the

(American News Service)
Bluefields, Nicaragua, Dec. IS. Am
erican residents are signing a petition
today addressed to the state depart
ment, appealing to Washington to di
rect the Nicaraguan congress to name
Juan Estrada president of the repub
lic in place of the abdicated Zelaya.
The petition will be cabled to Wash
ington. Messengers were dispatched
by boat ip and down the Atlantic
coast this morning seeking signatures
for the instrument. It is being signed
everywhere.
Estrada has indicated that he has
no personal desire for the presidency.
He says he would rather return to
his business. He announced, however,
that if he could accomplish more good
for Nicaragua as an executive than
as advisor, then he would place him
self at disposal of his people.
In Bluefields the war is regarded as
practically over.

Colon, Dec.
LOST SAILORS.
IS. Commander Hill
today hurried to a spot 18 miles east
of here, where the whaleboat of the
gunboat Marietta, missing for several
weeks, was reported to have been
washed ashore. The search for the
five men who were blown to sea in
the small boat when the Marietta was
at Port Limon was started anew.
When the whaleboat was sent on its
strange cruise, another small boat, in
which were five other men, went with
it. The crew of the latter succeeded
in making shore after suffering great
hardships. The whaleboat was wash
ed ashore, two hundred miles from
Port Limon.

HOME PHONE COMPANY
STILL INDEPENDENT
t Is Protected Locally and on
Long Distance Business
With Contracts, Running for
Long Period.
Even though J. Pierpont Morgan,
who is understood to be purchasing
the controlling interest of the Bell
Telephone company in various cities
in this section of the country, secures
the local Bell concern. Richmond pa
trons of the Home Telephone com
pany will not be affected, in view of
a twenty year contract taken out by
the latter company with the Bell peo
ple about a year ago.
In discussing the matter this morn
ing, William M. Bailey, president of
the Home Telephone company, stated
that he did not believe that Morgan
would purchase the Bell interests in
this city because of the fact that the
people here were protected by a con
tract He said that Morgan was after
the Bell interests in cities which were
not protected by a contract and that
if he did buy up the local interests it
would do him no good, as the contract
could not be broken. He declared
that in event all the local Bell stock
was bought by the financier, the
Home phone rates would remain ex
actly the same for twenty years at
least.
What His Object Is.
It is thought that Morgan's object
is to secure the controlling interest of
practically every long distance tele
phone system in this part of the coun
try. The local Home Telephone com
pany has taken out contracts with
three different long distance com pan
ies, the Long Distance company of
Indiana, the United States Long Dis
tance company of Ohio and the Bell
company. With the first two named
a 99 year contract has been signed
The local company is thus amply pro
tected against any movement that
may be made by the Morgan interests,
The Bell Telephone company of this
city conducts a long distance business
almost altogether, having only a few
subscribers in the city. The Bell
service is used by the Home Tele
phone company for long distance calls.
According to Mr. Bailey there is not
the slightest occasion for alarm
among local patrons over the fact that
Morgan is "going after" the telephone
business and no c,ut throat methods
will be adopted locally, in regard to
long distance rates.
JOE WONT RESIGN
Watson, After Interview With
Speaker, Declares the
Idea Is Absurd.
RUMORS ARE RIDICULED
Washington, Dec. IS. Former Rep
resentative James E. Watson arrived
in Washington yesterday and left last
evening for New York. He will re
turn to the capital early next week and
will spend several days here. Yester
day he went to the speaker's office and
had a talk with Mr. Cannon.
He characterized as absurd that Mr.
Cannon has any intention of resign
ing the speakership. As to whether
he would be a candidate to succeed
himself as speaker was another ques
tion, Mr. Watson said.
Two Years a Long Time.
It will be two years before a speaker
is to be elected and many things might
happen in that time, Mr. Wat -to sug
gested. "If Mr. Cannon should resign he
would take away the only political cap
ital that insurgents. like Victor Mur
doch have," said Mr. Watson. "They
make themselves popular at home by
abusing Cannon, and they ought to b?
glad that be intends to keep right o:,
wielding the gaveL You can - sa
there is just as much likelihood that I
will jump from the top of the Wash
ington monument as there is that Can
non will resign.
When Watson returns from New
York he will call on President Taft to
hare a talk on Indiana politics.
OBJECTIONS TO A RULING
An amended complaint in the case
of the Cincinnati, Richmond and, Ft.
Wayne Railroad company versus the
Indiana Railroad Commission, includ
ing Henry M. Dow ling, William J
Woodard and John T. McClure, was fil
ed this morniner with Harry E. Penny.
county clerk. The complaint was
originally filed in this court in 11"
when Union B. Hunt was a member of
the railroad commission. The amend
ed complaint substitutes McClure's
name instead of Mr. Hunt's. Th'
plaintiff seeks to have a ruling of the
commission set aside. The commis
sion ruled that the plaintiff should co
operate with a rail load company op
erating through Decatur in the con
struction and maintenance of an inter
locking and safety device system. The
commission ordered the installation of
an electrical apparatus for this pur
pose, while the plaintiff avers that a
mechanical device ol the above nature
would be sufficient and afford equally
as good protection as the more elabo
rate electrical device

MENTALITY NOT MET
President of Earlham College
Thinks That It Is Too Soon
To Give Judgment Letter
From Bryan.
President Robert. L. Kelly of Earl
ham College does not believe that the
caliber of the men sent to Oxford Uni
versity by the Rhodes scholarship
committee from Indiana and other
states is not equal to that of a future
president of the United States or Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court.
That the mental caliber of the men
sent to the English University by the
Rhodes Scholarship committee from
Indiana and other states is not up to
the standard or ideal of Cecil Rhodes,
the donor, is the statement made by E.
R. Parkins, of London, secretary of the
Rhodes Scholarship Trust, to President
W. L. Bryan of Indiana University and
who in turn wrote to President Kelly,
asking that a conference be held at
the University Club at Indianapolis,
some time in January to meet the four
new Indiana candidates for the Rhodes
scholarship.
Too Soon to Judge.
Dr. Kelly stated this morning that it
was not time, as yet, to judge the men

standard of the late Cecil Rhodes.
"Some of the men may yet become
president of the United States or chief

Kelly, when asked about the matter
this morning.

Parkins as saying that the men now

Former Secretary of Interior
Not Pleased Over Taft's
Methods in Neglecting Poli
cies of Roosevelt.
HL HAS ARTICLE IN
LAFOLLETTE WEEKLY
Editor of the Organ Has Con
siderable Critical Com
ment on the Actions of Sec
retary Ballinger.
Washington, D. C. Dec. IS. Copies
of LaFoIlette's Weekly Max&zine. a
publication owned and edited by Sena
tor LaFollette, of Wisconsin, reached
Washington yesterday.
The two most striking features are
editorial comments on President Taft's
message to Congress last week and an
article on the preservation of natural
resources by James R. Garfield, of
Ohio, secretary of the Interior in Pres
ident Roosevelt's cabinet.
Incidentally, there is a great deal of
critical comment of Secretary of the In
terior Ballinger by Senator LaFollette.
and a comparison of his policy with re
spect to the public domain and that
pursued by Secretary Garfield, all to
the former's detriment.
It is regarded as a rather singular
coincidence that Senator LaFollette
'SfS 5S
hvh,ch snr cameid sounds a
the continuation of the Roosevelt con-
servation policy.
Wants Congress Influenced.
Mr. Garfield does not specifically
find fault with President Taft's course,
but exhorts the people not to permit
congress to neglect the public Interests.
At the same time, by inference, at
any rate, he undertakes to set forth
the duty of the president In safeguard
ing the public domain against spoli
ation by self-centered corporate inter-
Thia he does in toe ,o,lowln
language.
What was done in dealing with
these natural resources of timber, fuel,
phosphates and water shows most
clearly the principle of executive ac
tion which governed the Roosevelt ad
ministration. The executive is a trus
tee of the property, rights and Interest
of the public. The people properly
consider the executive as their partic
ular advocate, their special representa
tive. His stewardship carries with
it grave responsibilities and affords
splendid opportunity to serve the peo
ple well.
Looked After the Public
President Roosevelt accepted both
responsibilities and opportunities.
The work for conservation Is possible
because he was constantly looking out
for the public Interest and was willing
to take action for the public welfare.
unless there was prohibition under the
constitution to prevent such action."
Senator LaFollette has boxed la
black type and Italicized those two
paragraphs, evidently considering
them as significant, and perhaps as a
veiled intimation to President Taft
that it would be well for him not to
deviate from the policy of his predeces
sor. Of course It does not follow that Mr.
Garfield intended any ulterior con
struction to be placed upon his lan
guage, for LaFollette- may have been
exercising editorial license in dressing
up what he considered striking para
graphs in the former secretary's arti
cle. Mr. Garfield apparently assumes that
the president will do his duty, although
there are sentences In his article
which are open to the construction that
he think6 Mr. Taft should be constant-
I ly reminded of the necessity of a foree-
ful course and attitude with congress.

"Everything Is perfectly amicably"
