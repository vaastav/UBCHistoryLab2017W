William Waldorf Astor, the expatri
ated American multi-millionaire, has
once more had it impressed upon him
that his naturalization as a British
subject has been in yain. . He has
been snubbed. lie took occasion to
make a public denial of a rumor that
he had purchased the famous Battle
Abbey, whereat the London papers,
with significant unanimity expressed
satisfaction that the historic pile had
remained the property of "an English
man." Willie knows by much sad ex
perience that the way of the tuft
hunter is hard.
The democratic press, pursu3jt to
its usual tactics, pretends to Te con
fused over the decision of the United
States supreme court in the insular
cases. What the court declared to be
the law by a majority of the judges
is perfectly clear and definite. The
opinions expressed by the several
judges in supporting or dissenting
from the decision itself form no part
of the law declared. It is quite likely
that the arguments of the judges pro
and con are confusing to most demo
crats, but there is no room to doubt
what the law is, and It sustains the
policies formulated by McKinley and
followed by Roosevelt.
The President's message is a plain,
business-like, straightforward paper,
in which big words and fine phrasing
are absent. In all its recitals of facts
it is exact and concise and in its rec
ommendations it is clear and marked
with common sense. Sturdy Ameri
canism and high governmental ideals,
such as McKinley loved to express,
characterize every portion of the
message and there is nothing to cause
surprise or alarm. The document
fulfills the President's promise that
he would not depart from the policies
of his lamented predecessor but no one
can gain from it the impression that
Roosevelt is a mere imitator of McKin
ley or that he has not made those
policies completely his own. The
message will be read with gratifica
tion by all true American patriots.
FAIRBANKS FORECAST.
Senator Fairbanks in a very recent
newspaper interview expressed him
self on the leading questions before
congress at the present session as fol
lows: ' ' -
It Is difficult to foretell exactly what
questions will most engage the at
tention of congress!. There will be
many important questions for consid
eration during the coming session and
the indications are that the session
will be a long, earnest and important
one.
Such advance has been made to
ward the modification or abrogation
of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty that we
shall be able to take up early the very
important subject of the construction
of an isthmian canal and the probab
ilities are that adequate provision will
be made for the early construction of
this great work, so important to the
commerce of the United States as well
as to the commerce of the world. It
has been intimated that there will be
sharp opposition to the project; but I
have seen no evidence of this myself,
and do not believe that, if It exists, it
can be effective. There will be a di
versity of opinion as to the details
for carrying forward the enterprise,
but with respect to the object to be
accomplished, namely,the construction
of the canal by the United States,
there can be no serious division of
opinion. "
A measure will be introduced at an
early date for the extension of the
Chinese exclusion laws, which expire
by limitation early in the coming
year. This is a subject of importance,
and that the policy of exclusion will
still be adhered to there is no doubt.
I do not believe that any general
taritr revision will be entered upon.
No modification should be made un
less the necessity therefore is clearly
apparent unless it is evident that
the modification of a schedule will re
sult in some direct good to the country,
to its trade and to the interests ot the
workingmen. A number of recipro
city treaties are pending for the act
ion of the senate and congress. They
will receive the fullest possible con
sideration, but what will be done with
respect to them it is impossible to say
at this moment.
What is said in the closing para
graph concerning reciprocity is de
serving of a second reading in con
nection with the last utterance of the
lamented McKinley on that subject
supplemented by the declaration of
President Roosevelt in his first mes
sage to congress
From among several candidates for
the place the county commissioners
have chosen Thomas B. Lee to suc
ceed George Stockman as trustee of
Bourbon township and the selection is
one that will meet with the universal
approval of the people whose in
terests he will serve. Mr. Lee has
been a resident of the township since
1863 and is known and respected as an
honorable and successful business man
who has made his own way in the
world. Though now seventy years of
age he appears to be in the prime of
his mental and physical powers and
having virtually retired fro n active
business he will be able to give the
trust he now undertakes a memorable
administration. That Tom Lee is an
old line democrat does not disturb us
in the present matter; we do not be
lieve he will decree free trade, free
silver and free soup in Bourbon town
ship. A man who is conscious of his own
rectitude and who is confident of his
standing in the community in which
he is known does not consider it nec
essary to deny false charges U may
be uttered against him, or if he docs
think it desirable to make a denial he
knows that a plain and dignified state
ment is sufficient for his purpose. In
variably it is the guilty man who,
when accused, xehemently Tociferates
his innocence and howls -vituperative
and vindictive epithets at his accuser,
thinking that by mere noise he can
convince the bystanders that he 5 is
guiltless and that by bringing in ex
traneous matter he can divert their
attention from the issue of his own
culpability. The best possible proof
that our statements about the Inde
pendent's fidelity to democracy -are
true is the form and substance of Its
denial. We stated several interesting
facts on that subject. . It chooses to
deny one of those facts and by pro
testing too much it gives convincing
evidence that we spoke the truth. By
ignoring-all the other facts charged
it tacitly admits their correctness.
We could, it it were a matter of suf
ficient Importance, substantiate each
of our assertions by affidavits and
some of them would be sworn to by
reliable democrats. The Independent
is very uncomfortable in the bed it has
made for itself.
Lee Succeeds Stockman.
The county commissioners Tuesday
afternoon' appointed Thomas B. Lee
trustee of Bourbon township to succeed
George Stockman, deceased.
MADDENING HARMONY.
"We can never win," declared Mr.
Fitzgerald, "if we do not discard the
heresy of free silver."
"We can never win," retorted Mr.
Ball, "unless men calling themselves
democrats support the national plat
forms of the democratic party. Press
report of the democratic congressional
caucus.-
The democrats are hopeful of get
ting together but the foregoing is a
fair sample of the harmony they are
seeing in high places within their
party. The assertion of Fitzgerald
and the retort of Ball contain exactly
the point at issue between McDonald
and Metsker here and the same div
sion is found in every community in
the nation. You can tell a democrat
any where by his ax.
AMERICAN SHIPPING.
No one has yet observed that the
ship-builders of the Umited States arc
suffering in the least for want of or
ders. Still, it is proposed to distribute
$9,000,000 a year in subsidies among
American ownersof home and foreign
built ships in order to encourage more
building. Philadelphia Record (dem.)
That is the narrow-minded view
that is characteristic of democracy in
looking at public questions, or else it
is a crafty attempt to deceive, which
is also characteristically democratic.
No one has denied that in the repub
lican good times of the past few years
the ship builders of the United States
ar? kept busy with orders. They are
one rating full time and full handed
. are paying high wages, -which
.ey did not do when the democrats
vrere "in clover."
But what are they building? Cer
tainly not ocean liners.The vast bulk of
the wonderful American export traffic
is carried in foreign bottoms under
foreign flags and the American ship
yards are not launching vessels that
can compete for that trade. We want
to "encourage more building" in or
der to give employment to more Am
erican labor and increase the home
consumption of products of .tmerican
farms; in order to bring millions of
dollars into American control that
now go into foreign .treasuries for
ocean freight charges; in order to as
sist in creating a wider market for
American wares and provide an auxil
iary force for our navy.
"Ships work for their own coun
tries," says the President .truthfully;
'from every standpoint it is unwise
for the United States to continue to
rely upon the ships of competing na
tions for the distribution of our goods.
It should be made advantagerus to
carry American goods in American
built ships." It costs more to build
ships here than abroad, American sea
men and officers get better pay and
better food than foreigners, our ships
cannot compete with the subsidies and
drawbacks that protect the merchant
marine of other nations. The problem
before congress is to overcome these
disadvantages so that our shipping can
compete with that-of foreign nations.

YANKEE NOTIONS.
: The ; hypothesis that promptness
and liberality are negligible factors in
securing new industries received an
other disagreeable .. concussion last
week in this city when a factory was
lost because the required fund was not
raised until the stipulated time had
passed. It will not do to say now
that the proposed factory was not de
sirable anyhow; that is merely the old
familiar talk of sour grapes that
Aesop hit off with great aptness in
his homely . fable. The contract
agreed upon by the Business Men's
association was a, good one and had
responsibility back of it. There is no
reason to doubt the good faith of par-'
ties. The thing to do now is to be
prepared for the next proposition and
to treat it in accordance with good
business principles, as the association
will do if the people will back it in its
laudable efforts to build up the busi
ness of the city. . ,
..
It may be recorded upon the highest
authority that everything is complete
ly inharmonious in local democratic
circles. The , courthouse clique has
made itself thoroughly disliked to the
large contingent of party men who are
not permitted to share in its benefits
and are excluded from the snaps that
are from time to time handed out Oy
the officials to their political favorites,
the district chairman has declared his
independendence of the state com
mittee at the behest of Iiis local boss
es, Martindale's aggressive candidacy
for judicial honors is distasteful to all
the lawers in the circuit, a newspaper
war has long been threatened and is
now on with as much asperity as can
be crowded into it, and the faction
th t demands harmony is determined
to have it even if the refactory silver
ites must be clubbed into a semblance
of submission. Marshall county dem
ocra j will be too busy with the fights
in its own ranks to pay much atten
tion to the opposing party in the im
pending campaign.
Did it ever occur to you that it
takes a great deal to make children
happy and did you ever see the like of
the way grown people will work to ac
complish the stupendous task? Look
at Thanksgiving and Christmas and
Fourth of July, think of the
birthdays scattered throughout the
entire year, recall the sctnol,
Sunday schocl and social entertain
ments that are cheerfully prepared
and carried through for the young
sters. What parent or grandparent,
uncle or aunt, brother or sister, can
remember a small part of the multi
tude of little things done daily for the
enjoyment of their little relatives?
Who can say, nevertheless, that any
of this enormous effort is wasted? If
it is blessed to receive the benefit of
these kind deeds it is surely more
blessed to give all that is required to
accomplish them.
" One of the peculiar situations that
are constantly arising in interna
tional commerce pertains to the ex
ports of wheat and flour. The cost of
carrying wheat, both on land and
water, is considerably less than the
cost of carrying flour. Within the
past two or three years foreign millers
have come to realize the force of that
fact and they are now grinding Ameri
can wheat in such quantities that the
export of wheat have doubled while
the exports of flour have been corres
pondingly reduced. This develop
ment is hard on American millers but
as yet they have failed to discover any
adequate remedy.
The phlegmatic and apathetic
Dutch ha'e in the last few weeks been
stirred almost to the point of giving
some expression to their feelings. In
deed, they do smoke faster than is
their wont. It is about a love affair.
Less than a ye e ago their young ani
much-loved queen, the beautiful
Wilhelmina, contracted a matrimonial
alliance with the German Prince
Henry and they had their picture tak
en in attitudes denoting affection
and everybody said it was a case of
true love and was so pretty. Now the
prince consort Is banished from his
bride and she is contemplating a di
vorce. It seems that Henry's wild
oats had been extensive and expensive
and Wilhelmina objected to paying for
them. Henry slapped the queen in
the face and cruelly stabbed a member-of
the royal ; household who was
present and ventured to expostulate.
There appears to be no hope of a re
conciliation and all Holland is brimful
of wrath and cabbage.

her coming been heralded in advance,
but she slipped in and out again with
out attracting any of the attention

arrived on the Lake Erie train from the
south at noon and took the first train

that she had been commanded by God
to drive the devil from the. train.

Narrow Escape From Injury.
While P. J. Kruver and Phil Hin-
kle were crossing the Pennsylvania
railroad at the Jacoby crossing Friday
evening after dark the spirited young
horse they were driving became fright
ened at something along the road and
suddenly shied to one side, falling
with the buggy and its occupants off
the high and narrow . embankment.
In the mix-up that ensued the buggy
was wrecked and the harness broken
up, but the men and horse escaped in
jury. It was a very narrow escape for
them. The railway improvements at
that point have left the crossing tem
porarily in a bad and dangerous condition.
