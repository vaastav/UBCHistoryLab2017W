were the last words uttered by the
condemned men of i-ie 24th United
States infantry as cne traps were
sp.-ung and they were dropped to
their death on the scaffold which had
been erected last night. Men of Com
pary C, Wth infantry, have been
guarding the negro nrisoners since
they were Irought to San Antonio to
stand trial befcre a courtmartial for
complicity in the riot at Houston on
Aucust 'J3 last. The execution took
place in an arroyo about two miles
eart of Camp Travis on a great scaf
fold which had been erected during
the ni;;ht by engineers from the post.
A column consisting of approxi
mately 1-5 cavalry men and 100 in
fantry soldiers assembled at the cav
alry .Tiiard hojse where the negroes
were confined at 5:30 o'clock this
morning.
Trucks were provided to convey the
prisoners to the scene of execution.
Col. Millard F. Waltz, post command
er, was in command of the column
and led the way to the scaffold. The
column arrived at the scafford at
6:20 a. m. A flood light had been
arranged to give light for those in
charge of the actual work of prepar
ing nooses and adjusting them to the
necks of the condemned men. The
cavalry and infantry guard assembled
in hollow square formation around
the scaffold and the prisoners were
given the order to march upon the
death traps.
Negro Minister Suys Prayer.
Without a tremor they stepped out
with soldierly tread and singing a
hymn they walked to their ulaees.
Prayers were said by a negro minister
and by two army chaplains and then
the men were ordered to stand upon
the traps. Resuming their song they
stood erect and displayed the great
est fortitude while the ropes were ad
justed. At 7:17 the major in charge
of the execution, gave the order to

Health Began To Decline After
He Had Made Will.
That children in the years to come
might remember the name and desires
of his dead wife for their welfare, the
late Scott Hopkins, president of the
Prudential Trust Co., for -years one
of Topeka's leading citizens, be
queathed a $2,000 trust fund to the
Topeka Free Public library. Provi
sion for the establishment of the trust
fund appears in his will filed today in
the Shawnee county probate court.
"The income is to be used annually
in purchase of books for children,"
reads the will. "Each book to be put
into circulation thru this agency is to
bear a book plate of my wife, Cora
Pierson Hopkins, which shall be a
fitting memorial for her constant de
sire to furnish children with sound
and wholesome reading."
Not another bit of sentiment crept
into the will, short, terse and business
like in its form. Hardly a page of
paper is used in outlining the division
of his estate, estimated at $125,000.
The petition for probate sets forth
that Scott Hopkins had real property
valued at $7,000 and personal prop
erty valued at $118,000.
Kstate to Children.
The entire estate is divided equally
among his three children. Warren
B. of Boston: Edna and Elizabeth
Hopkins, of Topeka.
"I give, devise and bequeath share
and share alike," reads the will.
Mr. Hopkins named the Prudential
Trust company and his daughter,
Edna, as joint executors of the es
tate. Provision is made that should
he die before his other daughter,
Elizabeth, reaches her legal majority,
that the Prudential Trust company
shall be named guardian.
The will was dated July 26. 1917,
which was about, the time that Mr.
Hopkins's health began to decline rap
idly. He left Topeka seeking treatment
about this time.
S. E. Cobb, vice president of the
Bank of Topeka, and treasurer of the
Prudential Trust company, accom
panied Miss Edna Hopkins to the pro
bate court. May -Malone and Mar
garet Judy, witnesses to the will, also
appeared at the court house.
GERMANY OFFER
Peace Terms Not Inviting to
Russian Bolsheviki.
Demands All Russian Wheat
for Fifteen Years.
London, Dec. 1 1. The Petrograd
correspondent of the Times attributes
to a responsible1 source the statement
that during: the informal conversa
tions between Russian and German
representatives at Brest-Litovsk re
garding the armistice on the eastern
front the Germans indicated that the
following points were likely to be in
cluded in any of their peace negotia
tions:
Germany to hav control of the
Russian wheat market for fifteen
years.
All German goods to be admitted to
Russia duty free.
No territory now occupied by the
Germans to be surrendered.
The correspondent says the Bolshe
viki were disappointed by the reserved
attitude of the German negotiators
and their lack of sympathy with po
litical idealism. Other causes contrib
uted to their depression but it is stat
ed they are determined to conclude
an armistice at any cost if the- latest
appeal by the Russian commissioners
to the allies fails.

FRENCH.
Pariii. Ieo. 11. "Patrol encounters
occurred north of Itpzonvaiix (Verdun
front) and near Thnre (Champagne),"

"Active artillery fighting developed in

BRITISH.
London, Te:. 11. Unusually active

ported in today's official communica
tion. This activity was particularly
noteworthy on the Ypres and Arras
front.
Field Marshal :i'jr"s tattle front re

belief that Germuny is seeking a weak

"south of the Scarpe and north of the

artillery activity yesterday.'.'
"eavy s helling"' at a number of local
ities was reported
F.aat of Epehy he said the enemy at
tempted to raid one post under cover of
a heavy bombardment but were re
pulsed. At other points on the Cam
brai front there were patrol encouuters
in which British forces dispersed en
emy workers and took prisoners."
The report was in line with the gen
eral beiief here of Germany's prepara
tions for a grand offensive. The areial
activity indicated enerpetic attempts to
seek out British positions and disposi
tion of forces, the artillery showed pre
liminary hunting out of weak spots and
the raids were of the sort which one
side employs constantly prior to an at

oppose them.

County Commissioners Fired
Opening Gun This "Morning.
BAD ROADS AID KAISER
Markham Makes Stirring Appeal
for Permanent Highways.
Howe Tells Clerks More Effi
cient Assessors Are Needed.
"A bad road anywhere in Kansas is
an aid to our enemy insofar as it is a
stumbling block to the highest effic
iency of those who live along its path.
And the final drive that must bring
us victory is not only the drive from
the cannon's mouth, but also the drive
from every farm home in Kansas."
With those two assertions sand
wiched between paragraphs, W. C.
Markham, secretary, of the state high
way commission, in an address this
afternoon, sounded the keynote of the
Topeka convention of Kansas county
commissioners and county engineers
who are here for a two-day session.
The commissioners and engineers are
meeting in connection with conven
tions of Kansas county clerks, regis
ters of deeds, county treasurers and
clerks of the district courts in session
here today and tomorrow. Hundreds
of the county officials are in attend
ance. The county commissioners held
their first session at 9 o'clock this
morning at the Memorial building and
after a general discussion of everyday
Droblems and routine business ad
journed at noon to meet again this i
afternoon at the same place. Gover- ;
nor Capper did not address the morn- t
ing session as stated in the program.
Owing to a rearrangement he will talk
at the general assembly of all the as
sociations tonight at the auditorium.
This meeting which begins at 8 o'clock
tonight will be the feature one of the
convention. Clarence K. Atken, Ford
county commissioner, will preside, and
in addition to Governor Capper, Mayor
J. E. House will talk. The governor
will talk on "Kansas' First Duty in a
Time of Crisis." .
Good Roads Chief Topic.
At the session of the county com-Tniseiooerw-
t his "f tern oon all the
speakers talked about good roads.
E. R. Moses took for his subject, "The
Relation between the County Com
missioners and the State Highway
Commission." The new national
highway' law was discussed by S. N.
Hawkes, assistant attorney general of
Kansas. Markham's address came be
tween that of Moses and Hawkes and
it embraced a stirring plea for "bet
ter roads and more of them."
"Time is often the turning point in
war," said Markham. "The whole
map of Europe would have been
changed could Napoleon have moved
his troops over hard surfaced roads.
Today more than 80 per cent of the
munitions and supplies of the allies
is transported by motor trucks over
real roads and a motor truck on a
real road means time.
"But some say that it is economy to
discontinue road building at the pres-.
ent time, on the theory that we need
our money and labor for more neces
sary things. Would they discontinue
the manufacture and use of candy,
chewing gum, tobacco, carpets, china,
jewelry, coffee, tea, electric signs,
wall paper or books ? Would they
cloe the theaters, stop gifts to foreign
missions, colleges and universities?
You know they would not, and yet
none of the things mentioned are as
essential to the efficient, speedy and
economic conduct of the war as per
manent roads.
"The National Council of Defense is
today, urging that motor trucks take
over all freight to be carried a dis
tance of 200 miles or less to relieve
the railroads. This means that in the
elements of speed, mobility and con
tinuity the motor truck is destined to
I be a permanent competitor of rail
transportation for limited distances.
Transportation is transportation,
whether it be in Kansas or Belgium,
and we all know that the farm near
est good transportation always brings
the highest price.
Must Have Hard Roads.
, "In order that the motor truck may
take up this new task it must have
hard rdads, the same as a railroad
must have rails. If the government
sees this call to be one of necessity
in war times, it is clearly evident that
it will be a permanent fixture when
wars shall cease. It has already been
demonstrated that highway freight
trains are an economic fact even be
yond the government call of 200 miles.
Today there are freight motor trucks
plying between Akron, O., and Boston.
Mass., and they cover this distance.
1,510 miles, in a week. It is said
that even express companies do not
deliver goods any more rapidlv and
the truck rates are already compet
ing with express rates. This means
that where freight is hauled over a
free right-of-way, the rates can easily
be reduced over those obtaining on a
railroad whose right-of-way must aid
in bringing a dividend to :ts stock
holders. As some one has said,, 'Sure
ly the star cf the motor truck is onlv
peeping above the economic horizon
Business Sessions.
Following the addresses the com
missioners and engineers resolved into
a business session, appointed commit
tees and heard reports of officers.
The registers of deeds were the only
association in addition to the county
commissioners to hold a session this
morning. They convened at 9 o'clock
in the office of J. T. Botkin. secretary
of state. Their entire convention will
be devoted mostly to technical prob
lems of office and the handling of
routine business.
The county clerks fired a sort of a
preliminary gun to the "Big Five"
convention Monday afternoon when,
as ex officio assessors, they met at
the office of the state tax commission
at a late hour. T. J. Kincsid, a mem
ber of the state commission, urged

A typical case -was cited of a man
in Indiana ordering a carload of per
ishables, say potatoes, from a Minne
sota grower. By the time a delivery
is made, prices have, dropped and re

results. While a settlement is being
effected, the potatoes are out of the
market, transportation is delayed and
by failure to unload sometimes the
food deteriorates.
"I am going to prosecute this in
vestigation to the limit and bring any
violators to the sternest payment of
justice," said Commissioner Murdock.
"It is hard to find words to describe
profiteers who are doing business
along such lines at this time when so
many men are giving up their lives
for their country. Such pernicious
business practices which net the men
who follow them a little extra blood

start and kept stamped out. I am
going to give my entire time to this

far as I am concerned I do not think
profiteering of this character can be
bettered by use of a feather duster; it
requires a club.

TOPEKANS TO GET RIFLES
Fifty Springfields Go to Captain
Hargis's Company.
State May Have To Provide '
Other Equipment.
Home guard' organizations in the oil
fields and in the industrial districts
will be at least partially equipped with
Springfield rifles from the federal gov
ernment. Charles S. Huffman, ad
jutant general, will this week dis
tribute 500 rifles and 10,000 rounds of
ammunition from the war depart
ment. Another shipment of rifles will
probably come to Kansas in a few
weeks.

Many Towns Want Guards.
Col. Jonathan D. Norton, in charge
of the home guard organization work
in Kansas, has received applications
from more than 100 towns and coun
ties desiring organizations. While a
complete roster of Hie various com

BRAVE TOMMYBAND
Mere Handful in Hand to Hand Fight
Holds. Back Division of Germans..
BY WILLIAM PHII,II SIMMS.
"With the British Armies in the
Field Dec. 11. One small group of
British Tommies 'held a whole Ger
man division at bay in one twist of the
great Cambrai battle.
The story did not come out in its full
heroic details until today.
In the deep dry bed of the Nord
canal, east of Mouevres, this little
group of British made one of the
finest stands of the war. As the Ger
mans poured into this miniature
Culebra cut, the British surged for
ward around a slight curve. They
hurled bombs and closed with the
enemy in a hand to hand scrimmage
of bayonets, bombs, sticks, clubs and
fists. The Germans were unable to
stand the gruelling man-to-man
fight. They retired. The British

Wounded British soldiers refused
to be moved back of the firing line
and begged to be propped up so they
could continue the fight.
The determined little band was
finally forced to retire, in conformity
with the general scheme of the British
command. But when they did go,
every soidi.er made it a point of honor
to carry a shell or an extra rifle, or
help get away machine guns. When
the Germans occupied their ground,
they did not find a pound of stuff left
behind.
