President Grant introduced hU proposals
relating to common schools and ( Lurch
property by drawing a picture, in colors as
warm as his prosaic mind could furnish, of
the gigantic march of the nation during the
first hundred years of iU existence. The
subject is great enough to kindle the imag
ination, even when presented in the cold
and business like style of a formal public
document, and the President's enumeration
of the points of progress would have been
quite comprehensive if he had not over
looked one of the most appropriate topics
of congratulation. It is, indeed, a proud
and striking contrast which he presents,
notwithstanding his important omis
sion. In territory, in population, in
wealth, in the progress of universal
freedom by the emancipation and politi
cal enfranchisement of the blacks, in the
application of science to the arts, in the
growth of manufactures, in facilities of c om
munication by means of railroads and tele
graphic lines, in the development of the
mining wealth of the country, in the progress
of intelligence, refinement and civilization,
the President has a just appreciation of what
the nation has done in the century which
has elapsed sinee its birth. It is a noble
picture even when sketched in rough out
line. without any glow of eloquence or colors
borrowed from the magic of poetry. Even
in the dry form of statement suitable for a
State paper it is fitted to kindle pride and
enliven patriotism.
But it is surprising that President Grant
could have left out of his magnificent cat
alogue of great achievements the one thing
which is more characteristic of American
progress than any other; the one thing
which peculiarly differences our advance
in the grand march of humanity from
what has been done within this fruitful
century by other nations. Other nations
have abolished slavery ; other nations have
applied steam and electricity to useful pur
poses ; other nations have made territorial
acquisitions, have improved their manufac
tures, extended their commerce, added to
their wealth and made marvellous advancos
in science and civilization. But the one great
thing which we have done within the cen
tury, and they have not done, is to effect
a complete divorce between Church and
State, and demonstr&te that religion does not
suffer by being left for its support to the vol
untary contributions of individuals. It is
astonishing that the President should have
omitted this bright and peculiar feature of
American progress in a Message whoso lead- ;
ing recommendations relate to the very same
subject and attest his deep sense of its im- j
portance. Had he extended his historical j
review to this interesting subject, he might
have discovered that there was no necessity
for his recommendations, and saved himself
from the absurdity of proposing, for the scc
pnd century of our independence, a work
which has been nobly accomplished in the
first, and of which the full praise belongs to
those who have gone before us.
In 177K, the year when our nation had its
birth, there was a union of Church and State
in all the colonies. The Declaration of In
dependence made no change in this respect,
nor did the adoption of the federal constitu
tion. It is true that, by an amendment in
grafted on the constitution subsequent to its
adoption, it was declared that "Congress
shall make no law respecting an establish
ment ol religion or prohibiting tho free ex
ercise thereofbut this restrained only
Congress, not the State governments, most
of which continued to tax people for the
support of religion for a long period
after. There is even now nothing in
the federal constitution to prevent any
member of the Union from establishing
a State religion. The divorce of government
from religion has been entirely accomplished
by State action. The work was begun in
Virginia ; it was finished in Massachusetts,
which amended its constitution for that
purpose at so late a date as 18U3. W ithin
the first fifty-seven years after tho Declara
tion of Independence the alliance between
Church and State in this country, which was
then universal, was successively dissolved
in every State in the Union, and there is no
more danger that any of them will go back 1
to the old system than there is that an eagle |
which has tried its pinions in the free air i
will go back, into the broken shell from
which it was hatched.
If it be asked what shall prevent, since
the federal constitution does not prohibit it, j
there are several answers, any one ot which '
is conclusive. One answer is, that tho
public opinion of this country has been for
the whole century steadily and triumphantly .
advancing in the contrary direction. An- ,
other answer is, that there is not a St.itr? in
the Union where nny religious denomir* u
i* not a minority of the people, and with
such a diversity of sects as exists all
would combine against attempts to confer
special advantages upon one. Still another
answer lies in the fact that in all or most of
the State constitutions as they stand at
present favoritism to any religious sect is
Strictly forbidden. Our New York constitu
tion affords a specimen in this language: -
"The free exercise and enjoyment Of re
ligious profession and worship, without dis
crimination or preference, shall forever be
allowed in this State to all mankind." There
is no feature of our national progress which ^
is a more solid ground of congratulation,
which is more peculiarly American, or which
is more truly a fruit of our institutions, than
the change from a universal alliance be
tween Church and State in 1/76 to the pro
hibitions against it which are a part of the
fundamental law of tho separate States,
adopted by their own free choice without
federal constraint. Having used their free
dom so well there is no reason why it should
be taken from them now.
It may, indeed, be said, not without plausi
bility, that, since the people of oil the States
are practically unanimous on this subject,
they have no reason to object to putting it in
the federal constitution. If the people
should adopt this view there are no argu
i ments of much force to be offered against it,
i any more than there would bo against tho
proposition of a few dyspeptic clergymen to
"recognize God in the constitution" by an
amendment. A majority of our people have
no objection to God, an l if it should ploase
them to rccognize Him by name in
! tho federal constitution it would b?
unwise to remonstrate, provided they
do it quietly without disturbing the
public tranquillity. But neither that
nor the amendment proposed by President
1 Grant is of sufficient practical importance to
be undertaken at the risk of setting the coun
try by the ears and inflaming religious ani
mosities. The democrats in Congress might
easily defeat the artful design of the Presi
dent by accepting the substance of his pro
posed amendments, with such modifications
as could be made in their passage through
Congress. They have only to accept the
proposition and help it forward to destroy
the motive with which it is offered. As
soon as the republicans should see that no
party capital was to be made out of it they
would quietly let it drop and the State Legis
latures would not ratify so needless an
amendment. Its success as a party move
ment depends on its stirring up a furious
agitation, and the democrats will play
into the hands of their wily adversaries
if they meet it with a vehement and noisy
opposition. It is a thing which would never
have been attempted but in reliance on the
folly of the democratic party in walking into
a trap. To accept this measure is the surest
way to kill it. Except for party purposes it
is as harmless as it is useless, and the
moment it is found to be of no service as a
party weapon the republicans will slacken
their zeal and make no attempt to carry it
through the State Legislatures.
As a stroke of party tactic& the democrats
would do still better to accept it in the crude
form in which it is proposed in the Message.
WhepMr. Blaine presents his more moderate
proposition in the House the democrats could
make a great party hit by amending it into the
precise form and very words in which it
is offered in the President's Message. In
that form the Protestant feeling of the
country would revolt against it, because it
would necessarily exclude the Bible from
the public schools, and deprive the Protes
tant denominations of other advantages which
they enjoy in most parts of the country. There
are hundreds of thousands of school districts
in which there are no Catholics, and in all such
places the teacher, if he happens to be a church
member, can not only read the Bible to his
pupils unchallenged, but give them Protes
tant religious instiuction. Such an amend
ment as President Grant proposes would both
exclude the Bible and destroy this privilege
of religious instruction. An eminent Pres
byterian divine, the Rev. Dr. Baird, in his
elaborate work, "lieligion in America," says
that the exclusion of the Bible would leave
the Protestants the "alternative ot supporting
a school of their own. This will generally
be done by the Protestants," he says,
"rather than give up the Bible."
The democrats in Congress have only to
accept the President's amendments and in
sist on their being couched in his language
to rouse the Protestant feeling of the country
against this party project. It would be a
great triumph for the Catholics to exclude
the Bible from all the common schools, and
the Protestant feeling of the country could
be relied upon to defeat amendments having
that effect. There was never a better oppor
tunity for the democrats in Congress to
adroitly spike a big republican gun.
Death Sentence*.
Our legislation in reference to capital pun
ishment should be revised. Although there
is a respectable humanitarian feeling opposed
to the infliction of death punishments, still
the sturdy sense of the Anglo-Saxon in Eng
land and in the United States believes that
life should be forfeited for life. Capital
punishment ia valuable as a deterring influ
ence in crime only in the promptitude and
simplicity of its enforcement. When a
prisoner is charged with murder in the first
degree he should be speedily tried. If guilty
he should be executed without delay. The
crime itself is so terrible, the clanger to
society from its tolerance is so great,
that the punishment to hav.e any force
at all should be swift and unrelenting.
This should be so even as a matter of
humanity to the prisoner. We can imagine
no situation of life more agonizing than for
an accused murderer to linger on for months
und months in his ceil awaiting trial, and
then after trial and conviction to linger on
for weeks and weeks awaiting the result of
notions for a new trial, and efforts to obtain
pardon or a commutation by the Governor.
No story of lingering death ever told by the
ingenious fancy of the romancer can equal
in pathos many stories of the Tombs.
Take the case of Scannell. Ho was im
prisoned for two or three years. The jury
disagreed twice before a verdict could be
reached. He was sent to the insane asylum.
Every day of these years was full of appre
hension and agony. Take the ease of Stokes.
He was tried, found guilty of murder in
the first degree, sentenced, on the verge
of death, the d.iy appointed for the execu
tion, when a new trial was ordered and he
was convicted of a minor offence and sent
lor a short term to prison. Think of the
agony that must have shadowed this man's
life. Think of the awful burlesque upon '
justice which was shown in the tact that two
juries could be found in New York in the
space of a few weeks, one of which would
regard a man as worthy to be hanged
and the other as simply guilty of man
slaughter. Take the case of Dolun, who was
doomed to die to-day. lie was suddenly
tried. His sentence was passed almost with i
exultation by his Judge; yet only yesterday
a deputation went to Albany to have him re
prieved on the ground that some new evi
d? ncd had been discovered, and succeeds in
obtaining a respite for one week. Yet this
in an is on the verge of death hoping, fear
ing, trembling, thinking of life stole and not
of his God. It the Governor had declined
to interfere, what time would he have had
for those religious offices which the humanity
of our law extends to the condemned?
Capital punishment to serve justice should
be swift and decisive. We should have a
law laying down the time in which a prisoner
should be tried, and limiting the period
betwern conduuinaticL find execution. Mur
der should be allowed to take precedence of
all other issues. At tiie utmost thirty days
should bo the amplest time given the Dis
trict Attorney to try kis prisoner, and this
trial should continue from day to day until
decided. If foi nd guilty and condemned to
death not move than ten days should elapse
I Imfnrfl th? ?*ee t.iun. Terrible as was the
punishment inflicted upon Atzerott and
Harold and the murderers of President Lin
coln it had a humane aspect in this, that it
was executed within three days after tho
sentence. As it is now, our law, while it pre
tents to be humane, imposes upon the con
demned prisoner a mental agony compared
to which the torture of the Chinese or the
Indians is merciful indeed.
The Glory of An Honest Life.
In this land and age of bitter animosities
the union of all conditions of people in
mourning for Cho#les O'Conor is a remark
ablo testimonial to the merits of a uniu who
always was a combatant, never a neutral.
Catholic and Protestant, democrat and repub
lican, rich and poor, gentle and simple, join
in the expression of a common grief, and we
even behold the unexampled spectacle of old
alwlitionists and scarred federal soldiers
shedding tears of heartfelt sorrow around tho
death bed of the counsel in the Leuimon case
and tho steadfast opponent of the civil war.
But the explanation is as easy as the fact is
marvellous. The character ot ( harles ,
O'Conor was genuine through and through.
Not an atom of his great fame but was hon
estly earned. From the day, half a century
ago, when, an almost friendless stripling, he
tried his first cause in a petty municipal
court, to the day when, crowned with laurels
in the highest forums of the State and nation,
he led the Bar of the United States, none of
his innumerable triumphs was won by any
other means than integrity, intelligence and
industry. Up his long ascent in prosperity,
from the obscure home of tho poor boy who
peddled newspapers from his father s press,
to the unostentatious but ample ease of the
scholar's villa at Fort Washington, his palm
was never soiled with gold ignobly gained.
Of what great lawyer of past or present days
cjin more be said ? Of how many of his liv
ing rivals can wo say so much?
Pro-eminent industry, intelligence and in
tegrity thus have distinguished Mr. O'Conor's
life from the beginning, but we yet hazard
nothing in asserting that liis purely profes
sional reputation will not, after a brief inter
val, abide so vividly in tho remembrance of his
countrymen as tho public services of a
mixed professional and political character j
which he has rendered during tho short ;
term of scarcely five years, since his w ith- ,
drawal from the active practice of the law. j
No fame is more fleeting In the public mind
than the fame of tli? dead advocate, unless it
be that of the dead actor. The sama sad lot
of oblivion befalls every lawyer, however
illustrious in his day, who does not mount
the Bench or else combine other pursuits
with his profession. Not twenty years have
passed since the death of liufus Choate, and
his memory already is as vague aB the mem
ory of Talma. Filed away among the records
of judicial tribunals here and at Albany and
Washington, never to be seen of mortal eye
save by the legal Dryasdust, are proofs of in
tellectual exertions of Charles O Conor,
whose singular research, keen wit and ad
mirable logio would secure almost an immor
tality to his name had they been expended
upon philosophy or literature.
It is not for us now to discuss the causes and
methods of this speedy obscuration of merely
legal exploits, nor to inveigh against this
usage of mankind. The mere professional
renown of the great lawyer may dwindle into
a shadow, but his name and memory as the
saviour of this city from the disgrace which
stained its government five years ago is cer
tain to endure through many ages. In tho
impending presence of his death the people
of New York, with only the exception of the
criminals themselves and of men bound by
retainers to their cause, acknowledge an
unstinted gratitude to him for his courage
and perseverance in delivering them from
the sway of official peculation. But it is
only after he has gone forever that we shall
fully estimate the extent of the obligation
and measure the potent influence which he
lias exerted over the colder natures or duller
intelligences of his associates. Behind his
quiet and dignified manner there was a tem
per of fire and a will of steel. His flag was
nailed to the mast, and he tolerated no faint
hearts among his crew. Those alono who
have been admitted to his confidence can un
derstand all the obstacles which have beset
his way since the flush of popular triumph
over tho Tammany lling in 1871 faded into
apathy in 1874, and can appreciate the dis
interested persistence with wtych he has
waged the war, despite the dismay of tho
community at beholding the shining marks
at which he struck. His nature was utterly
fearless, and he denounced a Judiciury which
interposed its own ignorance or corruption
to shield peculators as instantly and vigor
ously as he pursued tho criminals themselves.
His last labor, before he yielded to his
fatal illness, was an eloquent criticism of the
opinion of the Court of Appeals .which lib
erated Tweed from prison by a writ of habeas
corpus, and is quoted entire in Jlr. Browne s
review of the lling decisions of that Court,
which was printed in Harper's Weekly of No
vember 13 ; and on his deathbed, up to the
moment at which he ceased to busy himself
with mortal interests, his thoughts have been
full of the cause of political reform.
One secret of the generous and utter devo
tion of Mr. O'Conor to this cause lay in tho
fact that, genuine in all things, he was a
genuine democrat. W itliout citing any of
the countless illustrations of this which
might be drawn from the ordinary incidents
of his life, we cannot refrain from allusion to
the remarkable article, published scarcely a
year ago, in which ho embodied his political
creed, and which he first committed, under
tho title "Democracy," to the singular re
pository of John-ton's "Cycloptedia," and af
terwards consented to print, with supplemen
tary notes, in some of the public journals.
If his fame should rest on no other founda
tion than this essay it alone would admit
him to the first rank of political philosophers;
and wo predict for it as eminent a place in
the literature of political science as is con
ceded to the writings of Locko or Ilousseau
or Jefferson. Men holding looser theories of
the sphere of law will combat its conclusions,
and will claim that it is impracticable to
apply its theory to human society in this
century, but none will deny the purity of its
aims, tho tenacity of its logic, or the tendency
of the best minds of the present age to adopt
its argument, with more or less qualification,
for the limitation of tho functions of govern
ment.
But apart from anv political theories that
impelled Mr. O'Conor to tho great servioe*
which he has rendered to his countrymen in
these later years, a sufficient cause is mani
fest in the concurrence of opportunity with
ability that summoned him to a combat
from which he did not shrink, although he
well knew the cost to himself of the under
taking. At an age and after labors which en
titled him to pass declining years in calm and
ease he heard their call for succor and hur
r'(!|l t^10 strife in the truest spirit of chiv
alry. Ho dies in armor at the head of the
array of all good men against the powers of
political corruption, and the best honor we
can pay to his memory?the only honor he
would ask-is that we shall close the ranks
and continue the fight to victory.
What the Third Term Really Meana.
Bishop Haven, of the Methodist Church,
has created a sensation by his little speech
in Boston nominating General Grant for a
third term. Bishop Haven gives the key
note of his startling proposition when he
asks the question, "Shall the Puritan or the
Cavalier be tho ruler ?" This idea of bring
ing into our modern politics tho divisions
that existed between the Cavalier and the
Puritan is full of matter for reflection.
W? presume that if the modern Cavaliers
and the Puritans are to fight their battle*
over again we must regard General Grant as
the new Cromwell. Grant has many points
of resemblance to Cromwell. He is stub
born, unreasonable and a good soldier. He
believes the few things which he does believe
intensely. Recently he has been going regu
larly to church. Like Cromwell, he carries
his military system into politics. Every
movement he has made as President is based
upon the idea of a military campaign. When
he could not fight Lee he flanked him.
Although there were stories that came from
the battlefield every few days to the effect
that he was abandoning the fight and meant
to retreat, in the end it was seen that his
purpose was to capture Lee all the time.
What seemed to be retreats to the unprac.
tised eye wero feints and flanking move
ments.
In this manner ho has fought his campaign
for the third term. If any persons suppose
that he has abandoned the idea they do in
justice to his stubbornness and tenacity. He
tried to "flank" the opposition to the third
term by the Alabama movement and failed.
1 hen he-tried tho St. Domingo movement
and failed, ihen he tried "the Cuban jwar
cry" and failed. Then he tried Mexico and
the outrages on tho Rio Grande and failed.
Now he proposes the religious anti-Pope
flanking movement. Will ho succeed ?
In this our modorn Cromwell is as well
seconded by his favorite priests of the
Methodist Church as was the Lord Pro
tector by his Puritan priests when
ho made war upon the English mon
archy. Like Cromwell, he has his po
litical and military surroundings. Bishop
Haven is his Praise God Barebones ; Chan
dler is his Ireton, fervent in speech and
zealous for the cause ; Conkling is his Lud
low, who will stand by the new Protector
and go to exile rather than abandon him ;
Logan is his Harrison. We might pursue tho
parallel and find in the Cabinet and out of it
and in the small circle that surrounds him,
and in flatterers like Shepherd and adven
turers like Casey and over-zealous priests
like Haven, men who will be only too will
ing to do for Grant what the fanatics and
flatterers and adventurers in tho Puritan
time were only too glad to do for Cromwell.
What they aimed at was, if not a crown, the
power and the substance of a crown. The
modern Puritims aim at tho same thing for
their Cromwell. This, and nothing else, is
involved in the issue of the third term.
"Let So Guilty Man Utrape."
Now that General Babcock has been in
dicted at St Louis for a criminal offence, we
trust that his trial will bo conducted in the
spirit of the vigorous direction of the Presi
dent in relation to the Whiskey Ring prose
cutions. Wo are bound to believe that
neither President Grant nor any officer acting
under his instructions will show any indul
gence or favoritism to General Babcock on
account of the confidential position he has
so long held in tho Executive Mansion. It
would, of course, be awkward and embar
rassing to have complicity with the Whiskey
Ring brought so near home ; but it would lie
fatally damaging for the President to shield a
member of his official family who is indicted
for a crime. Justice must take its course ;
it must not forfeit the character given by
artists who represent her in marble as an
image with bandaged eyes and with even
scales suspended from her outstretched
hand. Tho bandaged eyes imply that she
can see no parties and that her scales are j
turned only by the law and the evidence. In
tho present case she must bo blind to the
fact that General Babcock is the private
secretary of the President, and deal with him
precisely as if he held no such relation.
It seems too obvious for argument that the
President's order for a court of inquiry
should be suspended now that an indict
ment has been found against General Dab
cock in a civil court. There is, indeed, no
legal conflict between the military and I
civil jurisdiction, but there is a moral
conflict which the administration can
not afford to disregard. If tho military
court should acquit, and the civil
court convict, the inculpated officer the
door would be opened for a kind of criticism
which the administration should be careful
to avoid. Nothing ought to be done outsido
of the civil trial which would tend to bias or
influence the jury. If the court at St. Louis
shall declare General Babcock innocent the
necessity for a court of inquiry will be super
seded by an honorable acquittal. If, on tho
other hand, the civil court shall find him
guilty, the verdict of the jury and sentence
of the judge will leave nothing for a military
court to investigate, and no duty will remain
but for the 1 resident to dismiss him from
the army. General Babcock asked for a
court of inquiry only when he found '
that his request to testify in the
trial of Avery could not bo granted.
It was his first wish to vindicate
himself before a civil tribunal. The thing
for which he first petitioned having now
become a necessity in consequence of tho in
dictment, there is no longer any reason for
the court of inquiry, which was granted only
on his rconest for the nurnose of vivincr hiir\
an opportunity of clearing himself if ha
oould. Tha coveted opportunity will b?
afforded by the civil trial, and there is no
reason for a different mode of investigation.
Moreover, the offence with which General
Babcock stands charged is not a violation
ot his duties as an officer of the army, but
a crime which fulls within the jurisdiction of
the civil authorities. When Colonel Baker
was recently brought to trial in England be
tore a civil tribunal the Queen's government
l left justico to take its ordinary course
instituting no military inquiry, and stand
ing quite aloof until after the jury had ren
dered its verdict. Its subsequent action in
cashiering that officer was founded solely on
the verdict There is no reason why the
military branch of our government should
pursue a different course. It is to be hoped
that the order for a court of inquiry to meet
in Chicago on Thursday will be suspended
during the trial of General Babcock befor?
the civil court.
'I hero is another question in connection
with this case on which the grounds of de
cision are not so perfectly clear. That ques
tion is whether the President should
continue to employ General Babcock ai
j his private secretary while this indiot
luont is pending against him. If the
; President believes him guilty there should,
I of course, be no hesitation. But it i*
probable that the Presidont thinks his
guilt is not yet proved. In that case it is a
delicate question. His dismissal would be
construed by the public and the jury as im
plying a belief in his guilt on the part of tha
President, and would prejudice his case be
fore the Court. The President mayjustifi
| ably hesitate to do anything which would
impair the chances of a fair trial if his own
mind is in doubt. If he is fully satisfied ol
General Babcock's innocence it is his clear
duty to stand by him.
"Tame" Statesmanship. ?Wo are afraid
i that California is too highly spiced as acom
I munity. The telegraph tells us that the
: President's Message is looked upon by the
people of San Francisco as a "tame docu
ment. " The Pacific coast inhabitants havo
been living on Big Bonanzas and in a rarefied
utmospliere, and aro accustomed to so much
. speculation that they have a diseased appe
tite. To our mind the value of the Presi
dent's Message is that it is a "tamo docu
ment." Our fear has been that it would be
i otherwise. We have had enough of the
"heroic" business at Washington during the
last fifteen years. What we want is tame
ne-is. The tamer the President's administra
tion continues until its end the better it will
bo l'or tho country.
