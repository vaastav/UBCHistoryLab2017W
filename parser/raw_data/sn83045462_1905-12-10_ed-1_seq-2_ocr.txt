may arts? as a result of the present sltua
tion.
For the past week or so Mr. Williams
has been hard at work preparing his recom
mends" :h affecting the minority commit
tee representation which he will sub
mlt to Speaker Cannon tomorrow night
an<l upon which the announcements 01
? democratlo appointments to the various '
House committees will be based. And Wr
the past week or so there have been con
tinued muttering* of d.scontent In the dem- i
ocratlc ranks. There Is always more or less
of this sort of thin*, however, and It wns
not until yesterday that the seriousness of
the situation became apparent.
But wlmn It became generally known yes
tef-tlay afternoon that the minority leader
hart decided to remove Representative La
mar of Florida and Representative Shackle
ford of Missouri from the House committee
on interstate and foreign commerce as a
matter of discipline, and on the ground that
they had violated their party caucus held
last year on the Davey rate bill and had
favored the Hearst measure: that he had
decided to name Representative Sullivan of
Massachusetts, whose chief claim to dis
tinction in the House wa.s his violent and
scourging attack upon Representative
Hearst, to a place on the great ways and
means committee, turning down in the pro
cess Representative Rundeli of Texas, who
was strongly Indorsed, and that he had re
fused a place on public buildings and
grounds to Representative Carter Glass of
Virginia, a friend and supporter of Hay,
the leader of last year's revolt, the gravity
of the situation became clearly apt,Trent.
The statement was freely made that Mr.
Williams was running things with too high
a hand. It was even Slid in this connec
tion that be Intended to remove Representa
tive Hay from his position on the military
affairs committee, where he is an aqtive
and a useful member. A Star man sought
out Mr. Williams last night and asked him
about it.
"No such thing," he answered with em
phasis. "And you will oblige me by quoting
u;e as saying that that report was started
by some malicious person who knew that
Hay had been fighting me and who thought
I was small enough to light back."
Lamar and Shackleford.
"It is also generally understood," Mr.
Willi una was told, "that it is your inten
tion to remove Representatives Lamar and
Shackleford from the committee on inter
state and foreign commerce."
"That." replied the minority leader, "is
another matter. There is nothing personal
in that. Lamar and Shackleford violated
ths agreement of their party caucus on
the Davey rate bill."
So far as the other important committee
assignments were concerned Mr. Williams
would say nothing, mentioning that he and
Speaker Cannon had decided not to discuss
the matter prior to the general announce
ment. wbioh will be made by the latter
probably next Tuesday. But It is generally
un<Jerstoou and accepted as a fact that
the minority leader will name Representa
tive Sullivan to fill the vacancy on ways
and means eiused by the retirement of
Representative Cooper of Texas and that
he will transfer Representative Underwood
of Alabama from the appropriations com
mittee to ways and means when there is
another vacancy, due to t'he retirement of
Representative Swanson of Virginia, who
was elected governor of the Old Dominion.
To fill the vacancies on the interstate and
foreign commerce caus?d by the removal
of Representatives Lamar and Shackleford
the minority leader will recommend the ap
pointment of Representative Bartlett of
Georgia and Representative Russell of
Texas. The appointment of Bartlett gives
Georgia a representation of two on this
i?nnmlttee. Representative Adamson being
already a member, and this makes this
phase of tho situation aimost unprece- j
dented.
When Glass went to the minority leader
and requested an appointment to public
buildings and grounds Mr. Williams refus
al and on the ground that a South Caro
l'nian having made the vacancy. It should
S by right to his successor. This is also
a extremely unusual expression. In a HUM
ure and establishes a precedent. Even when
Representative Taylor of Alabama, a long
time friend and supporter of Williams
went to him and pdeaded for Glass, Wil
i.ams was obdurate. Glass is a warm friend
ai d follower of Representative Hay.
But by far the most serious of the many
charges that are being made Informally,
and that later will be made formally,
against the minority leader. Is that relat
ing to his removal of Lamar and Shackle
ford from the interstate and foreign com
merce committee on the ground that they
Mulcted their party caucus agreement. Mr.
Williams contents himself with this sim
ple statement, and in opposition to It are
arrayed a numbet1 of facts that the friends
of the two representatives tn question con
tend are unanswerable.
An Is well known the caucus of last year
w*s not called for any such purpose as the
consideration of the Davey bill. That bill,
It has been recalled, was still under con
sideration by the committee, and as a mat
ter of fact that body was still taking tes
timony. its consideration at that time,
the-efore, was entirely unusual.
Facts as to the Caucus.
But as a matter of fact the caucus was
ailed by Mr. Williams with the Idea, avow
ed by him at the time, that he might sub
mit his resignation. He had reached that
frame of mind following the so-called re
volt of those democrats who under lead
ership of Representative Hay of Virginia
refused to follow the minority leader in
his attitude on the Gen. Miles matter,
which was then before the House. But
between the time that t'he caucus call was
sent out. Representative Williams having
been one of the first to sign, the minority
leader had attained a different frame of
mind. It w?s apparent, Say the friends
of Messrs. Lamar and Shackleford, that If
Williams had submitted his resignation at
the time It would have been accepted, and
Wllitams did not want things to figure out
that way.
But as it was necessary to give some
plausible reason for the call summoning
t!..j mem!>ers in caucus, the consideration
of railroad bill was put forward as the
excuse. A bill?or rather the mere frame
work of a bill?consisting merely of two
section*, so general in their nature that
they might have served as the basis for
alnii.'t any sort of a railroad rate prop
11911 on. were put before the caucus and
? dopted. Most of the members believe
democrats attending the caucus believed
tl , ? the purpose was not to agree on a bill,
i"it merely on certain principles, which
? ould later be Included In a completed
measure.
This measure of two sections was the
Davey bill. It was admittedly weak, In
cffle:ent and lacking in all of the most
xahi'nt features of the bill demanded by a
democratic constituency. And so five
merriments were added to it }n commlt
teo and It becamo the minority bill of the
interstate and foreign commerce committee !
Me" rs. Lamar and Shackleford signed
the report on this bill, and these gentle
on n. as the minority of the minority, sub
mit ?il a brief subsidiary report favoring
certain provisions or the Hearst bill.
The Davey bill as amended was accepted
by the democrats, but even then It was
Is. king In bome extremely essential points
;t! J it Is of record that the minority leader
on the floor of the House pleaded with the
re[ ? hlican majority to permit h!m to write
in thren additional amendments to this al
lege! caucus measure. His request was re
fu.W. but the friends of the two demo
rats who have been thn?wn off the Inter
state and foreign commerce committee say
?'.at if ar.y one violated the party caucus
't-'- .ment which they deny?John Sharp
\\ ililams. !n accepting tlie five amendments
and then requesting the permission to add
three more, violated it twice over.
Refuse to Be Head Out of the Party.
As a matter of fact, Messrs. Lamar and
Shackleford did not vote against the Davey
bill. They supported it, but, realising the
fact that the Hearst bill contained some
1 ssential provisions th3t the Davey bill did
made their subsidiary report in ac
ordan e with their views. They refuse
to be i-ead out of the democratic party, and
they refuse to permit an attempt border
g on that proposition to be made with
<> it a tion.
T " minority leader might have turned
down Lamar and Shackleford as hard as
he (i.ts made up his mind to do, and had
l.e not siven his reason for his action prob
tbly Utile would have ever become public
? ?n.-ei ntng the matter Both Rcpresenta
? > l.amar and Shackleford realize that
?f the minority Iead?;r Is not to have the
right to dictate minority committee assign
is its lie has been shorn of a large
par: his power. But the fact that Wil
liams gave as his reason the alleged vlo
laiiuns of a solemn party caucus agree
ment Is the mainspring of the present trou
ble. -
S/.ackleford and I did not violate our
caucus agreement," said Representative
!-amar to a Star man yesterday. "We
merely made a subsidiary report on the
Hearst bill, and we voted for the so-called
caucus measure. We were as true to the
d?c;sion of the party caucus as was Mr.
John Sharp Williams himself."
Mr Uraar added that lie did not car* to
discuss th? matter further at thta time. bat
would taka suoh action In the near future
aa he deemed best for the protection of hi*
nam* and hl? honor and integrity aa a
loyal party man and caucus member.
"I liave nothing to say teat bow," ?aid
Mr. Bbaokleford deliberately, wb*n a aired
what he thought of Mr. Wlmaina' action la
removing him from the Interstate and for
eign commerce committee as a matter of
"discipline." "Walt until the committee an
nouncements are made. I shall very decid
edly have something to say . then/
Representative Lamar la the man chiefly
responsible for the bringing of the impeach
ment proceedings against Judge Swayne
at the last session of Congress. He la an
Intelligent, aggressive Individual, Intensely
Interested in the various economic, financial
and administrative problems with which
Congrese is now grappling and who values
his place on the Interstate and foreign com
merce committee because of the opportuni
ties It glvea him for the study of these mat
ters at close range.
Voted for Williams.
Incidentally, it Is a matter of record that
he voted for John Sharp "Williams for
Speaker when the Mlssteslpplan succeeded
"Long Jim" Richardson. Mr. Lamar had
been previously pledged to Champ Clark
of Missouri, but when Williams' candidacy
was announced he wrote to Mr. Clark ask
ing to be released from his pledge. Mr.
I.amar explained that for thirty years his
well-beloved uncle. Justice Lamar, had
been among the foremost citlzena of Mis
sissippi, and that If he had been alive he
undoubtedly would have desired his nephew
to vote for the Mississippi candidate. Mr.
Lamar was released as requested and voted
for Williams.
It is too much to attempt to predict Just
what will happen as a result of the present
situation. But it Is certain that the first
gun has been fired In a fight that will be
continued until John Sharp Williams of
Mississippi is deposed as the leader of the
House democrats. There will be dissension
and bitterness to spare. There will be fac
tional fights and the contention of cliquea.
If there is nothing worse, nothing more sen
sational", nothing more serious, it will be
surprising to those who are best Informed
as to the height to which feeling runs on
the democratic side.
GEN. AINSWORTH'S REPORT.
Gratifying Efforts to Raise the Stand
ard of the Militia.
Gen. F. C. AInsworth, military secretary,
in his annual report on the militia of the
United States, says it is estimated that
about 75 per cent of the organized militia
would respond to the call for troops to re
pel invasion or suppress Insurrection
against the authority or the United States,
the percentage being the same as that es
timated for the preceding year. Continuing,
the military secretary says:
"Increase of interest on the part of the
younger men In the militia has been mark
ed. and the morale of the organizations has
been appreciably advanced. With but few
exceptions, where organizations have been
repcrted on adversely by Inspecting officers
the state military authorities have promptly
adopted remedial measures. Resignations
of officers have frequently been called
for and many companies have been com
pletely reorganized. All this evinces a dis
position on the part of the state authori
ties to bring their militia to a state of dis
cipline and efficiency that shall conform as
nearly as possible to that of the reguar
army."
The reports of army officers detailed as
instructors at state encampments in most
case3 indicate that great improvement has
been made in the method of Imparting In
struction to the troops participating in the
ei campments, and that the rank and file of
the militia, coming to realize the importance
of field service, are making efforts to de
rive the greatest amount of benefit from It.

COVERED 2,260 MILES AND 6 LAPS
AT THE FINISH.
End of Big Race Witnessed by 25,000
Persons?Special Prizes for
Riders.
NEW YORK, December 9.?Eddie Root
and Joseph Fogler, the New York team,
?won the six-day bicycle race In Madison
Square Garden after covering 2,260 miles
and 0 laps, the finish, shortly after 10
o'clock tonight, being witnessed by a
crowd of 25,000 persons. John and Menus
Bedell, the Long Island team, were
awarded second place: Mar Lean and Mo
ran of Boston were third; Vanderstuyft
and Stol, fourth; Hopper and HUlister,
flfth; Downing and Bowler, sixth; Logan
and Downey, seventh, and Galvln and
McDonald, eighth. There were seven
capital prizes, ranging from $1,500 to the
winners down to $200 for the seventh
team. Special prizes distributed among
the riders brought the aggregate of prize
money considerably above $5,000.
A crack of the referee's pistol at 10
o'clock announced the close of the race.
At that time Root and Fogler and the
Bedell brothers were tied for first place.
MacLean and Moran and "Vanderstuyft
?nd Stol were tied for third honors, and
Hopper and Hoillster and Downing and
Bowler were tied for flfth place. It had
been arranged in advance that in case of
a tied score in miles and laps the decision
would be given after an extra mile heat
between representatives of the tied
teams.
Fought for First Honors.
Eddie Root and John Bedell were chosen
to fight it out for first honors. The riders
were sent away within a few minutes after
the other team had left the track. Root
easily held his rival safe throughout the
distance and Anally won by four lengths.
The Bedells were favorites for the race
until early yesterday morning, when they
lost to Root and Folger the lead of one
lap they had maintained for thirty-six
hours previously. Root won the six-day
bicycle race last year when his riding
partner was Oliver Dorlon of Sheepshead
Bay. The record for a six-day contest is
2.733 miles and 4 laps. The ridersjn this
year's race therefore fell about 477 miles
below It.
Moran of the Boston team and Stol of the
Belgium-Holland team rode for third hon
ors, Moran winning in the final sprint by
one length. Downing and Hoillster of the
teams tied in flfth place furnished an ex
citing close to the contest. They rode
slowly about the bowl-like track until
near the finish, when both started to
sprint. At the height of the rush Down
ing's wheel slipped from beneath him and
lie had a bad fall. This enabled Hoillster
to win easily.
Special Prize for Clever Riding.
Matt Downey of Boston, who hitherto
has been an amateur, was awarded a spe
cial prize of $350 for hts clever riding,
having led in most of the sprints and hav
ing been in front during the greatest num

First, $1,500; second, $1,000; third, $700;
fourth. $500; flfth, $300; sixth. $250; sev
enth. $200.
The average dally attendance during the

ment, headed by P. T. Powers, has cleared
something like $00,000.
Sixteen teams started In the race shortly
after 12 o'clock last Monday morning. Some
of the'riders dropped out in pairs and some

Proposed Plans of Academic Faculty
of Yale.
NEW HAVEN, Conn., December 0.?It is
stated on high authority that the academic

MEETING AT PHILADELPHIA.
Foot Ball Rules Committee Discussed
the Game.
PHILADELPHIA, December 0.?Prob
ably the most important meeting ever
held by the foot ball rules committee be
gan here tonight with a full attendance
of committee. Owing to the popular feel
ing against the roughness which has
characterized the game It Is expected
that this meeting will result In soma
radical changes in the rules. The recent
declaration of President Roosevelt In fa
vor of a clear game will also exert con
siderable influence with the commltteo.
This was Indicated by a resolution adopt
ed late tonight. In which It was stated
that "this committee Is in favor of action
leading toward opening of the game and
the lessening of brutality; the placing
of the officials In a central body and rtn
derlng an evasion of rules unprofitable."
This resolution was adopted after the
reading of suggestions ottered by John C,
Bell, representing the University of Penn
sylvania. The suggestions, which were the
only ones offered during tonight's session,
proposed a more open game by strengthen
ing the center and weakening the ends
of the line. They were as follows:
First?The rules should distinguish be
tween unnecessary roughness and bru
tality.
The latter, viz., "brutality," should In
clude "slugging" and "kneeing."
The penalty for the3e offenses should he
disqualification of the guilty player until
the end of the half, no substitute being
permitted to take his place; two such dis
qualifications in a season to operate as a
bar to such player's further participation in
any Intercollegiate games during that sea
son.
The former, "unnecessary roughness,"
should Include the use of "straight arm''
and elbow on defense, "piling up" and
other acts of a similar character.
Second?To bring more open play the fol
lowing changes are recommended:
(a) Forward passing permissible back of
the line of scrimmage.
(b) On defense there shall not be more
than six players on the line of scrimmage;
of the players back of the line of Bcrirn
mage three of them must be at least five
yards back of the line; the remaining play
ers back of the line of scrimmage, If within
five" yards thereof, must be inside of the
positions of the two players on the ends of
the line of scrimmage.
(c) On offense the side having the ball
must gain ten yards on three downs or for
feit the same to the other side.
(d) There should be an official board of
umpires and referees chosen in advance of
the foot ball season and assigned to the
respective games by some duly constituted
authority.

District Attorney Llewellyn Thinks the
People Are Beady to Abandon
Fight for Separate States.
Ma]. W. H. H. Llewellyn, United State*
district attorney of New Mexico, and a
major In the Rough Riders in tb* Spanish
war, has been In Washington several days
and was at the White House yesterday. M?
has cose to the conclusion that joint state
hood for New Mexico and Arizona must
cone. To a Star reporter he saMi
"The sentiment favoring Joint statehood
is rapidly gaining much headway in New
Mexico. In my opinion the people of New
Mexico and Arisona will accept Joint state
hood when the constitution is presented to
them for their approval, provided that the
constitution contains a certain safeguard
j which will be required by the business In
terests of both territories. There must be
a provision limiting the indebtedness which
! can be incurred. This restriction must not
exceed 4 per cent of the assessed valuation
of the property, as Is now provided In what
is known as the Springer act in Congress.
There must be a provision in the constitu
tion prohibiting the voting of bonds for
the construction of railroads, as well as :i
provision limiting the term of governor to
four years and disqualitylng him from be
ing a candidate for the United States Sen
ate Immediately after tils term expires as
governor. This is to prevent the use of his
office as governor to elect himself a United
States senator.
Opposition to Joint Statehood.
"The opposition to Joint statehood Is of a
dual character?one sentimental, on ac
count of provincialism, and the other on
account of the large area. New Mexico Is
larger than New England, yet the joint
state will be smaller than Texas, although
slightly larger than California. The Idea
that Arliona and New Mexico are divided
In business interests Is erroneous. The
new state would not be half as antagonists
as are the interests of northern and south
ern California, which is governed harmon
iously as one state. Intimately the people
will be proud of their area, as are the peo
ple ol California and Texas, where, in the
latter case, to suggest the division or Texas
Into fbur states (which it has the right to
do) is to give mortal Insult to the state
pride of that great commonwealth.
Connected by Strong Ties.
"Arisona, with her great copper mines,
and New Mexico, with her vast fields of
coal, are connected by the strongest buel- [
ness ties, and the railroad lines now in
operation convey constantly to the great
copper camps of Arisona thousands of cars
of coke and coal annually. The irrigation
and grazing interests are identical in each
territory. There are people In Arisona,
who, unwittingly, perhaps. Judge the peo
ple of Spanish descent, living in New Mex
ico, by the standard of the laboring classes
or peons who come from Old Mexico to
Arizona to find employment. The Spanish
speaking people of New Mexico are con
servative, honest, law-abiding and the best
citizens we have in the territory. They are
people who shrink from contracting debts,
but are the best debt paying people in the
world. They haw ever responded with the
utmost promptness to the call by the na
tional government for troops in time of
war since the acquisition of that country
by our government. Speaking for myself,
personally. I would prefer single statehood
for New Mexico alone, but as that is out of
the question. I believe it Is the part of wis
dom to accept what we can get. and there
are many business Interests In both terri
tories, however, for economical reasons for
Joint statehood."
NO PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
Presbyterians to Ask Only for Re
placement of Property.
NEW YORK, December 9.?That the Chi
nese government will not be required to
pay punitive damages for the murder of
several missionaries of the Presbyterian
board of foreign missions at Llenchau,
China, several weeks ago, has been decided,
so far as that board is concerned.
Rev. Dr. Arthur J. Brown, secretary of
tha board, said today that the board has
decided that if It accepts any indemnity
at all for the murders It shall be only
for the actual cost of replacing the prop
erty damaged or destroyed by the murder
era, and that the board will refuse to ac
cept Indemnity for the dead. Mr. Brown
also gave out a letter which he has re
ceived from Sir Chentung Liang-Cheng, the
Chinese minister to the United States, in
which the minister wrote:
"I note with special gratification that It
has been unanimously decided by your
board not to ask nor to receive Indemnity
of a punitive character. I have lost no time
5n advising my government of the concilia
tory stand taken by your board In this
matter, which, I am sure, will be great
ly appreciated by my government, as it is
by mi-self. I have read with profound in
terest the extract from a letter recently
received from the Rev. John Rogers Peale,
one of the murdered missionaries. His
words seem to me to have a prophetic ring.
In his untimely death, America has lost a
noble son and China a true friend."
LEPROSY IN CHINA
Declared to Be Increasing, Despite De
nials by Chinese.
Special Cablegram to The Star.
CANTON, December 9.?It is believed that
leprosy is Increasing In China, despite the
reports of the Chinese government that it
Is being stamped out by degrees. The claim
is made that the reason the government is
so industriously circulating reports that the
dread disease is being rapidly extinguished
is found In the fact that leprosy among
coolies always has been a powerful argu
ment used against Chinese immigration to
the United States and other civilized coun
tries.
Some 00,000 lepers are known to be con
gregated in villages surrounding Canton
alone, and it Is stated that Rev. Father !
Conrady, who assisted Father Damlen
among the lepers at Molokal, Intends set
tling ne^r that City. In the leper village of
Fat Fung Yung, six miiea east of Canton,
where Father CJonrady probably will start
work, there are over 1,000 lepers. Lepers
are allowed to go to Canton, where they
are often seen In the crowded streets.

DECIDED TO STAY BY STRIKE
Warsaw Telegraphers Ignored Order to
Resume Work.
BERLIN, December 9.?A dispatch to. the
Lokal Anzelger from Warsaw, via Alexan
arovo, dated Friday night, says the Moscow
Railway Association has decided to support
the post and telegraph strikers to the ex
tent of refusing to transmit cipher messages
whether for the government or private per
sons. Railway telegraphers disregarding
this collective action will be sharply dealt
: with.
General Superintendent Sewastjanoft or
dered the district telegraph chiefs to dis
miss all telegraphers who did not appear
for work Friday. The telegraphers of the
Warsaw district today met and decided to
ignore the order and to continue the strike.
All the lines between Warsaw and Blelos
tok are Idle, while between here and Mos
cow they are only working so far as Bara
Rovitschi. Delegates of the Polish rail
way employes have decided to continue
v.-ork until the Ru^pian railways declare a

TRAFFIC TO CUBA OPENED.
Fever Quarantine Against Southern
Cities is Lifted.
HAVANA, December 9.?Gen. Rius Ri
vera, secretary of the treasury, has Issued
an order for the discontinuation of all quar
antine regulations against southern states
ports of the United States, thus permitting
the reopening of passenger traffic to Cuba
from the middle north by way of New Or
leans and Mobile. It is expected that the
prohibition by the United States of non
immune passengers proceeding northward
by the gulf routes will be removed to the
extent of permitting through passengers
from Cuba to proceed without detention.
There were no new cases of yellow fever
reported today. One death occurred and two
persons who had been ill of the disease
were declared to be well. The number of
cases now under treatment is fifteen. It is
believed that the cool weather now prevail
ing will be unfavorable to the development
of further cases of the infection.
The rains which have prevailed Jn Cuba
for the past ten days will, It is believed,
help the winter sugar crop. They have,
however, destroyed much of the growing
toabcoo crop in the richest portions of the
province of Pinar del Rio.
GALE ON THE COAST.
Storm Was Particularly Severe Around
Cape Hatteras.
NORFOLK. Va., December 9.?As a result
of the southeastern gale that raged fiercely
all day along the Atlantic seaboard, the
point of greatest severity being Cape Hat
teras and vicinity, there are three crafts
practically on the beach between Cape
Henry and Cape Hatteras, and shipping
has been entirely suspended out of Norfolk.
The steamer Aragon is ashore seventeen
miles north of Bodies Island. A large barge,
the tow of the Aragon. turned loose early
this morning, is ashore between Nags Head
and Kell Devil's Hill. An unknown schoon
er Is ashore near Gulls Shoals. An unknown
schooner reported tonight anchored oft Cape
Henry, a mile and a half from shpre, evi
dently In a crippled condition.
Throughout the day the storm raged,
accompanied by gusty rajns, the wind at
Cape Henry station registering a velocity of
forty-eight miles an hour from the north
east. The wind at Norfolk was tlilrty
elght miles an hour. The weather bureau
officials announce that while the storm can
not be rated as exceptionally severe, it is
remarkable for its disastrous effects on
Shipping. Many vessels and steamers that
had put to sea, finding the conditions be
yond the bay too treacherous for safe navi
gation. put back into the harbor and the
pilot boats were kept busy.
6o far as reported no lives have been
lost although the damage to shipping will
be quite severe. The life-saving crew at
Cape Henry continuously patrolled the
beach. The crews of all the stranded ves
sels with the exception of the steamer Ara
gon' have been landed by the life savers.
They declined to abandon the vessel when
signaled.
At midnight the storm was abating and
the wind veering to the northwest. It is
expected that t'he storm will have passed by
tomorrow, but the promise Is for partly
doudy weather and much colder.

Annual Debate With Univer
sity of Virginia.
ATION AL EIFLES'H ALL
LOSING TEAM COMPLIMENTED BY
REPRESENTATIVE GAINES.
Contest in Which George Washington
University Carries Off the
Honors.
George \\ ashlngton University defeated
tho University of Virginia last n'.glit in the
fourth annuel debate between these two In
stitutions, by demonstrating to three disin
terested judges that "The Cnlted Stat-*
government should exercise control over
the formation and operation of all corpora
tions engaged In Interstate commerce." Vir
ginia fought valiantly on th# negative side
of this question, and her three representa
tives were warmly congratulated bj Rep
resentative John Wesley Gaines of Ten
nessee. who acted as chairman.
The debate was held In the National
Rides Hall, on G street northwest noir Htn
street, and the large auditorium was well
filled with the relatives and friends of the
speakers and students from both untver
, ties. George Washington was represented
by Messrs. Alvin L. Newmyer of the Dis
trict of Columbia, law ? ?>. Marcus II. Burn
stlne, also of the District of Columbia Uw
t#>. and Edward P. Gates of Kansas, aca
demic OS. Mr. Leonard Shelton, law (Hi,
served as alternate, but was not called upon
to assist In the argument. Virginia was

Florida, law 07; A. Herbert Forem tu or

ginia. graduate. Virginian alternate was
Mr. T. B. Gay. The judges of the content
were William Draper I.ewis, dean of the
law school of the University of Pennsyl
vania: Maurice Francis Egan, professor of
English at the Catholic University of Amer
ica, and Ernest Ludlow Uogan of Prince
ton University, Messrs Leonie Bone or
George Washington University and B. A
Megiimls of Virginia acted a? timekeepers.
College Enthusiasm.
The evening was enlivened with the usual
portion of college enthusiasm. The color-*
of the two rival universities hung from
many vantage points, and the students from
George Washington were continually "g!v
ing them the ax." An orchestra was pres
ent and furnished appropriate music din
ing the evening. President Needham of the
local university was present on the plat
form, having as his guests several prom!
nent educators. Tn introducing the firs'
speaker Representative Gaines declared thai
nothing could be more fitting than an argu
ment between Virginia, the home of Jeffer
son, and George Washington, who persis
tently opposed Jefferson in all matters of
vita] public administration.
"No doubt," said Mr. Gaines, "these
young statesmen will settie once and for
all this question that has been troubling
older folks so many years."
This put the audience In a good humor,
and Mr. Newmyer, the first speaker for
George Washington, was Introduced und. r
excellent auspices.
Mr. Newrayer's Argument.
Mr. Newmyer did not start in by claiming
that federal control of corporations engaged
In interstate commerce could prove a pana
cea for all existing Ills, and he admitted
that such a course would not bring about
a commercial millennium?at least, not
within the next generation or so, but he did
claim that evils exist that demand a rem
edy; that the present system or state con
trol Is inadequate and unsatisfactory and
that federal control Is the only practical
and effective remedy left. Mr. Newmyer
addressed himself to the first two of these
propositions.
Opens for Virginia.
Mr. Faires opened the argument for Vir
ginia and the negative. He frankly ad
mitted that there are exls-ting evils In the
system of incorporation, but lie told the
gentlemen from George Washington Univer
sity that these evils had been gro?ly ex
aggerated and that federal control was not
the proper remedy.
Second for Affirmative.
Mr. Burnstlne, as the second speaker
for the affirmative, avowed that Mr.
Paires had permitted his Imagination to
run away with him. This created a laugh
from the George Washington rooters (if
the local students may be so termed). He
then addressed himself to proving the
practicability and effectiveness of federal
control, and In doing so he severely cross
examined Mr. Faires, who had preceded
him. He cited the national bank laws as
an example of federal control that had
become established, and h6 referred to
similar laws now In force In Germany,
Australia and the English colonies Jn
concluding he brought In the recent in
surance scandals as a sample of state
control and the rottenness of the existIng
system.
Employs a Simile.
Mr. Foreman, for the negative, asserted
that the proposition of the affirmative
was similar to the case of the farmer
who killed his entire flock of sheep in
order to get rid of two or three black
ones. He said that some corporations
need control?and that some do not. He
differentiated between the individual
who carried on interstate traffic and the
corporation so engaged, and said that ti m
affirmative proposed to control the latter
while the former could go ahead unmo
lested. This, h? said, was manifestly ui.
fatr. He showed many complications of
what he declared would be dutil control
that of the state and the federal govei !.
ment.
Had Gone Astray.
Mr. Gates, for the affirmative de
that the negative had gone astray.
"We are not debating everything In th>?
world," said lie; "we are confining out
sell to one question. Our friends on tho
other side have wandered a thousand miles
away from It. We are not advocating a
government cure-all. We do not say tiiat
the federal government should control
measles, but we do say it should control all
corporations engaged In Interstate com
merce. Chief Justice Fuller Is authority
for the definition of control In this le
gard. He said It reeana regulation and not
restriction.
Federal control would protect the public."
In concluding Mr. Gates advocated publicity
In connection with federal control as an ef
ficient remedy for the many evils enumer
ated.
The Closing Speech.
\lr. Bidgood closed for Virginia by com
ing out with a new plan. He did not stick
closely to the question at issue, but put up
another remedy?improved state control.
He said tfhat common carriers had been
controlled by the federal government for
years with poor success. He said further
that trusts could not be" controlled by the
federal governmeflt.
In rebuttal each speaker was given five
minutes, but notwithstanding the hard
fight put up by Virginia, the three judges
decided in favor of the affirmative and
George Washington University.
Theft of Two Stoves Charged.
George Moseley and Augustus Barnes,
colored, were arrested last night by Pre
cinct Detective Relnhardt of the fourth
precinct and held to answer for the alleged
theft of two stoves from in front of the
store of Isaac Applesteln, on street
southwest. There Is no claim that there
was any fire la the stoves, but It is al
leged that they were In front of the busi
ness place on exhibition when they were
taken. Three stoves were removed from
in front of the store and two of them have
been recovered. Moseley and Barnes are
to be given a trial ia Judge Kimball's court
tomorrow morning.
