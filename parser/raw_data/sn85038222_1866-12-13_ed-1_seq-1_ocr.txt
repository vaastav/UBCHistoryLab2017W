.national achievement when, for

and remembering ; only .their in
structive lessons, we resume our
onward career as a free, prosper
ous and united people". ' ;
In my message of the 4th of De
cember, 1865, Congress was inform
ed of the measures which had been
instituted by the Executive, with a
view to the gradual restoration of
the states in which the insurrec
tion occurred, to their" relations
with the General Government.
Provisional Governors had been
appointed, conventions called.Gov
ernors elected, Legislatures assem
bled, and senators and Representa
tives chosen to the Congress of the
United States. Courts had been
opened for the enforcement of laws
longm abeyance. The blockade
had been removed, custom-houses
re-established, and the internal rev
enue laws put in force, in order
that the people might contribute to
the National income. Postal oper
ations had been renewed, and ef
forts were being made to restore
them to their former condition ol
efficiency. The States themselves
had been asked to take part in the
high function of amending the
Constitution, and of thus sanction
ing the extinction of African slav
ery, as one of tie legitimate results
of our internecine struggle.
Having progressed thus far, the
Executive Department found that
it had accomplished nearly all that
was within the scope of its Consti
tutional' authority. One thing,
however, yet remained to be done
before tho work of restoration
could be completed, and that was
the admission to Congress of loyal
Senators and Representatives from
the States whose people had re
belled against the lawful authority
ot the General Government. This
question devolved upon the respec
tive Housesx which, by the Consti-tutioiT,-aWinade
the judges of the
elections,returns, and qualifications
of their own members; and its con
sideration at once engaged the at
tention of Congress.
In the meantime, the Executive
Department no other plan having
been proposed by Congi ess -continued
its efforts to perfect, as far
as was piacticable, the restoration
of the proper relations between the
citizens of the respective States,
the States, and the Federal Govern
ment, extending, from time to time,
as the public interests seemed to
require, the judicial, revenue, and
postal systems of the country.
With the advise and consent of the
Senate, the necessary officers were
appointed,and appropriations made
by Congress for .the payment of
their salaries. The proposition to
amend the Federal Constitution, so
as to prevent the existence of sla
very within the United States or
any plaje subject to their jurisdic
tion," was ratified by the requisite
number of States; and on the 18th
of December, 1865, it was officially
declared to have become valid as a
tart, of the Constitution ' of the
nited States. All of the States
in which the insurrection had ex
isted promptly amended their Con
stitutions, so as to mate them con
form to ' the great change thus
effected in the organic law of the
land ; declared null and void all or
dinances and laws of secession; re
pudiated all; pretended debts and
obligations created for the revolu
tionary purposes of the insurrec
tion ; and proceeded, in good faith,
to the enactment of measures for
the protection and amelioration of
the condition of the colored race.
Congress, however, yet hesitated to
admit any of these'jStates to repre
sentation ; and it was not until to
ward the close of the eighth. month
of the session .that an ; exception
was made in favor of Tennessee, by
the admission .of : her Senators and
Representatives. '
; I deem it a subject of profound
regret , t;hat Congress hae thus far
failed to admit to seats loyal Sen a-,
tors and Representatives from the
other, ; States, (whbse inhabitants,
with those of Tennessee; had en
gaged in the rebellion. ' Ten States
more than one-fourth of the whole
number remain without represen
tation ; the seats of fifty members
in the House of Representatives
and of twenty members in the Sen
ate, are yet vacant not by their
own. consent, not by a failure of
election, but by the refusal of Con
gress to accept their credentials.
Their admission, it is .believed.
would have accomplished much to
ward the renewal and strengthen
ing of our relations as one people,
and remove senous cause for dis
content on the part of the inhabit
ants of those States.' It would
have accorded with the great prin
ciple enunciated in the Declaration
of American Independence, that no
people oueht to be made t bear
the burden of taxation, and yet be
denied the right ot representation.
it would have been in consonance
with the express provisions of ; the
Constitution, that "each State shall
have at least one Representative,"
and "that no State, without its con-
sent, 3hall bo deprived of its equal
suurage in the Senate." These
provisions wera.inrhdfwl to soc.nrA
to every State, and to the. people; of
every btate, the right of represen
tation in each House oi Congress ;
and so important was it deemed by
the framers of the Constitution that
the equality of the States in the
Senate should be preserved, that
not even bv an amendment of the
Constitution can any State, with
out its consent, be denied a voice
in' that branch of the National Leg
islature. It is true, it has "been assumed
that the existence of the Stales
was terminated by the rebellious
acts of their inhabitants, and that
the insurrection having been sup
pressed, they were thenceforward
to be considered merelv as con
quered territories. The legislative,
executive, and judicial depart
ments of the Government have,
however, with great distinctness
and uniform consistency, refused to
sanction an assumption so incom
patible with the nature of our re
publican system, and with the pro
fessed objects of the war. Through
out the recentlegisla'lioh , 6f ' Con
gress, the undeniable fact makes
itself apparent, that these ten po
litical communities are nothing less
than States of this Union. At the
very commencement of the rebel
lion, each House declared, with a
unanimity as remarkable as it was
significant, that the war was not
tt waged, upon our part, in any
spirit of oppression, nor for any
purpose ot . conquest or subjuga
tion, nor purpose of overthrowing
or interfering with the rights or es
tablished institutions of those
States, but to defend and maintain
the supremacy of the Constitution
and all laws made in pursuance
thereof, and to preserve the Union
with all the dignity, equality, and
rights of the several States unim
pared ; and that as soon as these
objects" were "accomplished the
war ought to cease." In some in
stances, Senators were permitted
to continue their legislative func
tions, while in other instances Rep
resentatives were eleoted and ad
mitted to seats after their States
had formally declared their nVht to
withdraw from the Union, and were
endeavoring to maintain that right
by lorce of arms. All of the States
whose pebple were in insurrection,
as States, were included in the an.
portionment of. the direct tax of
twenty minions ot dollars annually
laid upon the United States by the
act approved 5th AuffusL 1861.
Congress, by the act of March 4,
1862, and by the apportionment of
representation . . thereunder, also
recognized their presence as States
in tie Union ; and tney have, for
jutjticialjpurposes, been divided in
to districts, as States alone can be
divided. The same recognition ap
pears in the recent legislation in
reference to Tennessee, which evi
dently rests upon the fact that the
functions of the State were notde
8tr )yed by the rebellion, but mere
ly mspended j and that principle k
of course applicable to those States
which, like Tennessee, attempted
tosrenounce their places in the
Union. i , " -
" .'The action of the Executive De
partment of the Government unon
thjs; .subject has been equally defi-
juiic uuu iiiuiurm, aim uie purpose
ojthe'waras specifically Stated
in,. the -proclamation issued. 'by
my" predecessor bnV the g2d day of
September, 1862., .It was then6ob
emnly proclaimed and declared
that "hereafter, as heretofore the
war will be prosecuted for the ob-
ject- of practically restoring ; the
Constitutional relation between
the United States and each , of the
States and the people thereof, in
which States that relation is or may
be suspended or disturbed."
.' The recognition of- the States by
the Judicial Department of the
Government has also been, clear
rind conclusive in all proceedings
affecting them as States, had in the
Supreme, Circuit and District
Courts. ; ,
In the admission of Senators and
Representatives from any and all
Ot the States, there can be no just
ground of apprehen sion that per
sons who are disloyal will be cloth.
?d with the powers of legislation;
for this could not happen when the
Constitution and the laws are en
forced by a vigilant and faithful
Congress. Each House is made
the "judge of theelections,returns,
and qualifications of its own mem
bers," and may, "with the concur
rence of Iwo-thirds, expel a mem-j
ber." When a Senator or Repre
sentative nresenfs his rprh'fipnrn f
election, he may at once be ad
mitted or rejected; or, should there
be any Question as to hi elicihili-
ky, his credentials may be referred
ui csuuuuii iu me appropn
ate committee. II admitted to a
scat, it must be upon evidence sat
isfactory to the House of which he
thus becomes a member, that- he
possesses the requisite Constitu
tional and legal qualifications. If
refused admission as a member for
want of due allegiance to the Gov
ernment, and returned to his con
stituents, they are admonished that
none but persons loyal to the Uni
ted States will be allowed a voice
in the Legislative Councils of the
Nation, and the political power and
moral influence of Congress are
thus effectively exerted in the in
terests of loyalty to the Govern
ment and fidelity to the Union.
Upon this question, so vitally af
fecting the restoration of the Uni
on and the permanency of our
present form of government, my
convictions, hcretolore expressed,
have undergone no change; but, on
the contrary, their correctness has
been confirmed by reflection and
time. If the admission of loyal
members to seats in the respective
Houses of Congress was wise and
expedient a year ago, it is no less
wise and expedient now. If this
anomalous condition is right now
if, in the exact condition of these
States at the present time, it is
lawful to exclude them from rep
resentation, I do not see that the
question will be changed by the
efflux of time. Ten years hence, if
these States remain as they are,
the right of representation will be
no stronger the right of exclusion
will be no weaker.
The Constitution of the United
States makes it the duty of the
President to recommend to the
consideration of Congress "such
measures as he shall judge neces
sary or expedient." I know of no
measure more imperatively de
manded by every consideration of
National interest, 60undpolicy,and
equal justice, than the admission
of loyal members from the now
unrepresented States. This would
consummate the work of restora
tion, and exert a most salutary in
fluence in the re-establishment of
peace, harmony, and fraternal feel
ing. It would tend greatly to re
new the confidence of the Ameri
can people in the vigor and stabil
ity of their institutions. It would
bind us more closely together as a
nation, and enable ns to show to
the world the inherent and recu
perative power of a Government
founded upon the will of the peo
ple, and established upon the prin
ciples of liberty, justice and intel
ligence. Our increased strength
and enhanced nrnsnerit.v wmiM ir

. InfOur efforts to preserve te(
unity of (he governmehiT" which
constitutes us one people," by res
toring the States to the condition
which they held prior to the rebel
lion, we should be cautious, lest,
having rescued our Nation from
perils of threatened disintegration,
we resort to consolidation, and in
tho end absolute despotihfn, as a
remedy for the recurrence of simi
lar troubles. The war having ter
minated, and with it all occasion
for the exercise of powers of doubt
ful constitutionality, wo should
hasten to bring legislation within
the. boundaries prescribed "by the
Constitution, and to return to the
ancient landmarks established by
our fathers for the guidance of suc
ceeding .generations. "The Con
stitution which at anytime exists.

authentic act nf tlia wholn npnnln

"ii, in ine. opinion oi tne people,
the distribution pr modification of
the Constitutional powers . be, in
any particular wrong, let it be cor
rected by-an amendment in tho
way in which tho Constitution des
ignates. Rut let there be no
change byusurpation ;" for "it is
the customary weapon by which
free Governments are, destroyed."
Washington spoke these words to
his countrymen, when, followed by
their love and gratitude, he volun
tarily retired from the cares of pub
lic life. "To keep in all things
within the pale of our Constitu
tional powers, and cherish the Fed
eral Union as the only rock of
safety," were prescribed by Jeffer
son as rules ot action to endear to
his "countrymen the. true princi
ples of their Constitution, and pro
mote a union of sentiment and ac
tion equally auspicious to their
happiness and safety."
Jackson held thatthe action of the
General Government should always
be strictly confined to the sphere
of its appropriate duties, and justly
and forcibly urged that our Gov
ernment is not to be maintained,
nor our Union preserved, " by in
vasions of tho rights and powers of
the several States. In thus at
tempting to make our General
Government strong, we made it
weak. Its true strength consists
in leavinrr individuals nml Stfiloa
as much as possible to themeslvcs;
in maKing iisen leir, not m its pow
er, but in its beneficence: not in
its control," but in its protection :
not in bindinrr the States mnm
closely to the center, but leaving
each to move unobstructed in its
proper Constitutional orbit." These
