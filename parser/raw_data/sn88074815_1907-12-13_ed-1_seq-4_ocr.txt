Jacksonville has still another can
didate in the person of Ion L Farris
representative from Duval county in
the last legislature who will opose
i Representative Frank Clark for the
I latters seat in congress Mr Farris
iis a bright young man with pronounc
ed convictions and the courage to
voice them He is however tackling
a strong man who n he gOfS up against
Representative Clark and while his
candidacy may serve to nmkp him ac
glinted with the voters of the dis
trict and thus bo of value for some
future contest it is hardly likely that
it will at this time cause Mr Clark
any uneasiness Pensacoia Journal

YauchuIa Advocate
The Tampa Tribune Is anxious to
know how many of those who came
lout at Ocala will stay out at the bid
ding of the primary Is there any
doubt on the subject Are we to have
a primary election that decides noth
ing If the Tribune knows of any
reasonable ground for its doubt it
would be well to settle the question
before we hold the primary The
democratic party in Florida need not
invite destruction by dividing itself
into warring factions refusing to obey
the primary as it was once common
to deny obedience to the convention

IT MAY MEAN WAR
The recall of Ambassador Aoki by
the Japanese government is the sen
sation of the hour
Captain Nash instead of being

slope beating them back from landing

The following from the Washing
ton correspondent of the Chicago Tri
bun is keenly significant
The recall of Viscount Aoki the
Japanese ambassador is the diplomat
ic sensation of the day in Washing
ton
Its significant was heightened
yesterday by information allowed to
leak out that he had been withdrawn
in spite of an earnest intimation made
to his government by President
Roosevelt that he would be glad to
have the ambassador remain accred
ited to the United States
While the authorities are nor a lit

Prof James McIntosh Bell director
of the geological survey of New Zea
land now visiting this country says
that the extension of suffrage to wo
men has resulted in better legislation
for the schools and the home and in
a higher standard of character for
public officials One marked feature
Is the tendency of the members of a
family to vote together The influ
ence of the family in public affairs
has been increased since each family
now counts two or more votes while
a bachelor counts but one

All the world loves a lover but

SANITARY INSPECTION AGAIN
Meat Inspection
Sanitary science has been greatly
extended since the advent of the lac
It is
of diseases
man
terial origin many
I I
now a well established fact that some j
I
I parasitic diseases are common to man
I and many of the domestic animals j
In some instances a disease may not i
always manifest the same symptom
of pathological lesions in a man that i
it does in animals and the disease
I wherever found may he caused by
the same microorganism Yet such
a disease is transmissable from ani
mals to man or from man to animals
The common illustrations of such dH
eases are found in tuberculosis and i
anthrox k is a positive fact that dur
I ing the last few years a sufficient i
I tubercu j
number of eases of anthrox
losis swine plague hog cholera and I
numerous other local diseases fevers I
etc have been observed in the south I
to justify a thorough and efficient
I
meat inspection in your city We may
also state that it is only a question
of tim until we have a national and
state law requiring each state and
city to have sanitary inspectors It
will not only be the aim of the meat i
inspector to cut oS one of the ways i
of transmitting the germs of disease I
to man but also to eliminate from the I
food of man the poisonous chemical j
compounds known as Ptomaines leu
coniames and organic ferments that I
may be developed in the body of an
animal during disease or may be de
veloped in decomposing meat Many
of tbese chemical compounds are very
poisonous and they cannot always be
destroyed by cooking the meat as I
can the germs of disease For in
stance in the disease known as tetan
us lockjaw the tetanus bacillus de
velops or in some way produces a
chemical substance called tetatin
which is a very powerful poison in
tact will kill a healthy man or horse
in a short time it a comparatively
small quantity of it is Infected into
the circulation It is in the same man
ner that many other poisonous chem
ical compounds are developed in the
body of animals during disease Its
obvious to well informed medical men
or any educated man that thorough
and efficient meat inspection is a
practical means of preventing many
diseases in too human family I say
thorough and efficient because
there is a tendency on the part of the
powers who appoint inspectors to ap
point political favorites regardless of
their qualifications That day is
passed when a man can be an expert
in more than one thing It is a Fr r at I
mistake to think that a druggist car
penter horsetrader liveryman or
butcher can make an efficient meat
inspector without a special education
for such work
Not only should we inspect our
meats anti and post mortem but we
should look after the sanitary condi
tions as to the way it is kept and ban
