NawsrAFfcK PoetkT. Nearly all newspa

of what i sometimes called poetry than met
can Cod ritber room or readers fur. Some of
this so-called poetry does n't rise to the dig
nity and merit of respectable doggeral. We
bare received from a love stricken corrrspon
dent at a distance a batch of rhymes of pre
cisely this description. To that e rreson
dent we desire to gay one friendly word, and
as it is intended solely for bis bent-fit. we
trost be will receive it in the' same friendly
spirit. - -Z"I
In the first place, "Rodolph," your "poe

to the young, and it it evident that yu at e

Till Gabriel's awfu trump shall sound

And we mutt further say, that if "Sallik' is
as rensible a girl as the general ruu of Sal-

In all probability that heart of your?, whiwe
constancy is. we will admit, all you represent
it to be, will be incapable of keeping any
sort of an image long before the little mimi

unless, indeed, ihere is more foundation for
the belief of the Hitlerites than the peace ol
the pnblic mind would eeem to demand. And
as the "Doom of Time" has never, to our
kjow ledge, done either Gabkirl or bin Trump
an iuteniional wrong, we can't help tbiukiug

the sake of argument, tbat you were not horn
great ; and further, merely for the sake of
truth, tbat you have not had, and are not
likely to hrve. greatn- s thrust npon you ;
hence, if yoa are to become great you must
achieve tbat greatness. We would advi-e
you t- do so by all means. But if you at
tempt to accomplish your tl jct by writing
poetry, you will find in the eud tbat jou have
taken the wrong road.
The LrxATic Astlcm at IIopkxxtuxk
Kt. We copied into our Monday morning'
issue, from the Gaiettt of the d.iy before, a
paragraph in reference to the d-struc ion fy
tire of the Lunatic Asylum at II .kinsville.
Ky. The Gazerte' informant stated that fifty
of the inmates of the institution lost th-ir
lives. It turns out, however, th it this was a
mi-take, and tbat the iomatrs were all res
cued from the buruicg building- This news
will be bail -d with a thrill of pWsure ny
all. There was something very terrible and
appalling in the thought that fifty human
beings, lertft of reason and helpless, had
perished by fire. -

For years, aye, from time immemorial, have house

the power of reuniting the fragments of crockery,

filled by Mr. H. C. Spalding, or Xo. 30, Piatt steel,

requisite in every family as the lucifer match or me
tallic pin. This glue is engrossed in a chemical solu
tion, the manufacture of which is of cousse a secret
with tbe proprietor. Its adhesive qualities aro truly
astonishing, joining together, as it will, heavy pieces

S far tiom this power- having b-icn dele

of ilus whole qgaiitst a delit:q'ient Sratt cira
up for consideration, Mr. Ma lisu opposed
it in a brief but powerful speech, frout
which I shall extract but a singl st'iiteuce.
He observ d "th it the us ? of force agiinst a

war than an infliction of pmrislimen. and
would ri'ooitUy ' be ciinsrder d by th i p trly

his m ilion the clause was unat.int'iusty ptrsi

Congtess ot tin; ol I Ctnf-dwation
Without d -siriur to p.iriicularize, it may
be safely asserted that tlie jiotver to make
war against a State, U at varunce wiib lbe
wbtd-sp rit and intent of tbe Constitution.'
S ipposr such :i war would result iu the co i
qirtu;a State, how ar we to jro.ern it
uferward? Shall we bold it as a Province
and ern it by despotic poivei? In the nt
lure of ibiugs we could not, by pnyical foree.
control tlie whr.le of tbe people aud compel
ibeiu toileCt Senators and Representatives
to Congiess. and. to perform all tbe other
duties, depending upou thirowu vlitiou
and require from the free citiz of a free
State a? a consiitu-nt member T the Con
federacy. But it wt p ss hed this power,
would it be wise to exeicis it uuder existing
circumstances? The obj-ct" would doutles
be to preserve the Union. War would uot
only present tbe most eff. Ctual means of de
stroying it, tiut would banish all hope ot its
peaceable reconstruction; bestd'-s in the fra
ternal confl ct, a contest of blot d and treas
ure would Ixi expected, rendering further re
conciliation between the States impossible.
In the meantime who can foret.dl what
would be the sufferings aud privations of the
people duriug its existence. But may I Le
permitted sol mnly to Invoke my country
men to pun-, aud deliberate before they de
term ne to destr y thi-, the grandest temp e
which has i ver been dedicat d to bum m
freedom since the world tiegin. It hs been
consecrated by tbe blood of our fathers, by
the glories of the past and by lbe hopes nf
tlie future. The Union has already made ut.

ca ses tbe hearts ot our cou u try men to swell

brink ot tbe yawning aby-a we shall recoil
wita ho-ror from the last laul p.unge. By
Mich u dread catastrophe, the hopes ot th

would be destroyed, axtd a loug night of

nay. it is uot ev ry grievou.s wrong wnw:i

already reached aud pas-ed tbu culinlnaiing
point, but if in the-midst of the existing ex
citement, tbe Uiiiou sUali petlb, lbe ev.l
may then ljco:iie irreparable. Gougress
can contribute much to avoid it by propos
ing and recommending to ibe Legislatures
of several Slates the "remedy for existing
evils, which lbe CouSi.il ntion has itself pro-vid-i
for its own preservation. This has
been tried aid iff. rent critical periods of our
history, and always with nauent succes.-.
It is to be found iu the fifth Hrticle. provi
ding f r its own aineadtneut. Uuder this ar
ticle atcendments have been pmposed by
two-tbitds of loib houses of Cogtes, ahd
have been ratiB. d by the L gujl.ttures ol
tbree-fourtbs of tbe several S ates, uud have
cousiqiu ntly become parts of tbe Constitu

of relieion. of abridging the freedom ot

Though we are also indebted for the rights
which secures the people against any aouse
of power by the Federal Government, such
wete the apprehensions justly enieriained by
tbe friends of State Riyhls at that period us
to have rendered it extremely doab.lul
whether tbe Constitution could have long
survived without these ainendnieuts. Agaiu
tbe CuiiEtituiion was hiu uued by tbe same
urocess. after the election ol" President Jell' r-
son bv the Ilou-e of Representatives iu Feb
ruary, 1803 This am-ndmeut was rendered
necessary to prevent 'be re-occurrence of tbe
dangers wbicb had seriously threatened tbe
existence ot the Government during tbe pen
dency of tbat election, lbe action lor lis
own ameudut -tit was intended to secure tb
utu cable udjasim' nt of conflicticg constitut
tioual aues.Uons like lbe preseut, which nugu
arise between tbe Government of tbe Slates
aud that of the Uuited States. This appears
from contemporaneous history ia this con
section. : - ; "., ,
I thall mereiy ca st'eotiou to a few sen
tences in Mr. Madison tft isi If eelebtatd re
port iu 1779, to tbe Legislature of Virginia.
In this be ably and conclusively defended the
resolutions of tbe preceding Legislature
araiuei tbe Btricuresol several otber Sta-e
Legislatures. Tbede .were mainly founded
npon the protest of the Virginia Legislature
aifaiust tbe Alu-n and Sedition acts, as pal
pable and alarming infractions of the Con
stitution. Ia poiutiug to tbe peaceful aad
Coos iiutioaai remedies, and be referred to
ooue others, to which the States were autho
rized to resort ou such occasions, he con
cludes by saying tbat tbe Legislatures of tbe
States might have made direct repreoeuU-
tiou to Cougress witb a view lo obtun a re
scinding of the two offensive acts, or tbey
miiiht have represenud to tbiir respective
Seuaiors in Cmirress, their wish tbat two-

an explanatory amendment of lbe Constitu

originate witb Cougresa or the Stite Legis
latures, as may be deemed moxt advisable to
obtain tbe object. Tbe explanatory amend
