President's Message.
Fellow CmzExs of the Senate asd
House of Representatives: The mem
bers of the Forty-sixty Congress have as
sembled in their "first regular session un
der circumstances calling for mutual con
gratulation and gratfful acknowledgement
to the Giver of all good for the large and
unusual measure of national prosperity
which we now enjoy.
The most interesting events which have
occurred in our public affairs since my last
annual message to Congress are connected
with tbe financial operations of the Gov
ernment directly affecting the business in
terests of the country. I congratulate
Congress on (he successful execution of the
resumption act. At the time fixed and in
the manner contemplated by law. United
States notes began to be redeemed in coin.
Since the first of January last they have
been Diomntlv redeemed on presentation
and in all business transactions, public and
on vale, in all parts of ue country, tney
are received and paid out as the equivalent
of coin. The demand upon the Treasury
for gold and silver in exchange lor united
Stales notes has been comparatively small,
and the voluntary deposit of coin and bul
lion in exchange for notes Has been vety
large. The excess of the precious metals
deposited or exchanged for United States
uoles over the amount of United Slates
notes redeemed is about $40,000,000.

RESUMPTION AMD THE BUSINESS REVIVAL.
The resumption of specie payments has
been followed by a very great revival of
business. With a currency equivalent iu
Value to the monev of the commercial
world, we are enabled to enter upon an
equal competition wiih other natious in
trade and production. I be increasing for
eign demnnJ for our manufactures and
agricultural products has caused a large
balance of trade in our favor, which has
been paid in gold, from the 1st of Julv last
to November 15ih, lo the amount of about
1 59,000,000. Since the resumption of spe
cie payments there has also been a marked
and gratifying improvement of the public
credit. The bonds of the Government
bearing only four per cent, interest have
Deen sold at or above par, sufficient in
amount lo pay off all of the national debt
winch was redeemable under present laws,
Tbe amount of interest saved annually by
the process of refunding the debt since
March 1st, 4877, is fl4,29r,177. The bonds
sold were largely in small sums, and the
number of our citizens now holding the
public securities is much greater than ever
before. Tbe amount of the National debt
which matures within less than two years
is $782,121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear
interest at the rate of five per cent., and
the balance is in bonds bearing six per
cent, interest. It is believed that this part
of the public debt can be retunded by the
issue oi four per cent, bonds, and, by tbe
reduction of interest which will be thus
affected, about (11,000,000 can be annually
saxed to the Treasury. To secure this im
portant reduction of interest to be paid by
the United States, lurther legislation is re
quired, which, it is hoped, will be provided
by Congress during its present session.
The coinage of gold by the mints of the
United States during the last fiscal year
was 40,S86,912. The coinage of silver
dollars, since the passage of the act for
that purpose, up to November 1st, 1879,
was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have
been issued from the Treasury and are now
in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in
possession of tbe Government.

The pendency of the proposition for

recommend that Consress reirain from

The great revival of trade, internal and
foreign, will supply during the coming
years its own instructions, which may well
be awaited before attempting further ex
perimental measures with tbe coinage. 1
would, however, strongely urse upon Con
gress the importance of authorizing the
Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the
coinage of silver dollars upon the present
legal ratio. The market value of the silver
dollar being uniformly and largely less
than the market value of the gold dollar,
it is obviously impracticable to maintain
them at par with each other if both are
coined without limit. If the cheaper coin
is forced into circulation it will, if coiued
witbout limit, soon become the sole stand
ard of yalue, and thus defeat the desired
object, which js a currency of both gold

RETIRING UNITED STATES NOTES.
The retirement from circulation of
United States notes, with the capacity of
legal tender in private contracts, is a step
to be taken in our progress toward a safe
and stable currency, which should be ac
cepted as tbe policy and duty of tbe Gov
ernment, and the interest aud security of
the people. It is my firm conviction that
the issue or legal tender paper money based
wholly upon the authority and credit of
the Government, except in extreme emerg
ency, is without warrant in the Constitu
tion, and a violation of sound financial
principles. The issue of United States
notes during the late civil war with the
capacity of legal tender between private in
dividuals was not authorized except as
a means cj rescuing the country from im
minent peril, l be circulation of these
notes as paper money, for any protracted
period ol time alter tbe accomplishment of
this purpose, was not contemplated by the
framers of the law under which they were
issued. They anticipated the redemption
and withdrawal of these notes at the earl
iest practicable period consistent with the
attaintment of the object for whiob they
were proviueq.
I be policy ol the United states, steadily
adhered to from the adoption of the Con
stitution, has been to avoid the creation of
National debt, and when, from necessity
in time of war, debts have been created,
tbey have been paid off on the return of
peace as rapidly as possible. With this
view, and for this purpose, it is recom
mended that the existing laws for the ac
cumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to
extinguish tbe public debt within a limited
period be maintained. If any cbange ol
the objects or rates of taxation is deemed
necessary by Congress, it is suggested that
experience has shown that a duty can be
placed on tea and coffee, which win not
enbanee the price at those articles to the
consumer, and which will add several mil
lions of dollars annually to the Treasury.

THE POLYGAMY PROBLEM.
The continued deliberate violation by a
large number of tbe prominent and in
fluential citizens of the Territory of Utah
of the laws of the United States for tbe
prosecution and punishment of polygamy
demands that the attention of every de
partment of the Government. This Terri
tory has a population sufficient to entitle it
to admission as a State, and the general
interest as a nation, as well as the welfare
of the citizens of the Territory, require its
advance from the territorial form of gov
ernment to the responsibilities and privi
leges of a btate. This important change
will not. however, be approved by the
country while the citizens of Utah in very
considerable number uphold a p met ice
which is condemned as a crime by the laws
of all civilized communities throughout the
world.
The law for the suppression of this of
fence was enacted with great unanimity by
Congress more than seventeen years ago,
but has remained until recently a dead let
ter in the Territory of Utah, because of the
peculiar difficulties attending its enforce
ment. The opinion prevailed among the
citizens of Utah that the law was in con
travention ot the constitutional guarantee
of religious freedom. This objection is
now removed. The Supreme Court of the
United States has decided the law to be
within the legislative power of Congress,
and binding as a rule of action for all who
reside within the Territories. There is no
longer any reason for delay or hesitation in
its enforcement. It should be firmly and
effectively executed. If not sufficiently
stringent n its provisions it should be
amended, and, in aid of the purpose in
view, I recommend that more comprehen

THE ELECTION LAWS.
The elections of the past year, though oc
cupied only with Site offices, have not
failed lo elicit in the political discussions
which attended tbem all over the country,
new and decisive evidence of the deep in
terest which tbe great body of citizens take
the progress of the country toward a
more general and complete establishment,
whatever cost., of universal security and
freedom in the elective franchise. While
many topics of political concern demand
great attention lrom our people, botn in
tbe sphere of National and Slate authority.
find no reason to qualify tbe opinion I
expressed in my last annual message, that
no temporary or administrative interests of
government, however urgent or weighty,
wilt ever displace the zeal of our people in
defense of the primary ngblsof citizenship,
and that the power of public opinion will
override all political prejudices, and all
sectional and Slate attachments, in de
manding that all over our wide territory
the name aud character of citizen of the
United Stales shall mean one and the same
thing, and carry wil h them unchallenged
security and respect. I earnestly appeal
the intelligence and patriotism of all
good citizens of every part of the country,
however much they may be divided into
opinions on other political subjects.to unite
compelling obedience to exismg laws
aimed at the protection of the right of suf
frage. I respectfully urge upon Congress
supply any defects in these laws which
experience has shown and which is within
lis power to remedy. I again invoke the
of the executive and legislative
authorities of the States in this great pur
pose. I am fully convinced that if the pub
mind can be set at rest on this para
mount question of popular rights, no se
rious obstacle will thwart or delay the com
plete pacification of the country, or retard
me general aiuusion oi prosperity.
CIVIL SERVICE REFORM.
a former message atten
tion of Congress to the subject ot the re
formation of the civil service of the Gov
ernment, and expressed the intention of
transmitting to Congress, as early as prac
ticable, a report upon this subject by the
chairman ot the Uivii service uommission.
In view of the fact that, during a con
siderable period, tbe Government of Great
Britain has been dealing with administra
tive problems and abuses, in various par
ticulars analogous to those presented in
this country, and that in recent years tbe
measures adopted were understood to have
been effective and in every particular high
ly satisfactory, I thought it desirable to
have fuller information upon the subject,
and accordingly requested the chairman of
Civil Service Commission to make a
thorough investigation for this purpose.
The result has been an elaborate and com
prehensive report.
The report sets forth the partisan spoils
system in Great Britain, and the rise and
of the parliamentary patronage, and
official interference with the freedom of
elections. It shows that after long trials
various kinds of examinations, those
which are competitive and (ipen on equal
terms to all, and which are carried on un
der the superintendence of a single com
mission, have, with great advantage, been
established as conditions of admission in
almost every official place in the sub
ordinate administration ot that -country
of British India. The completion of
report, owing to the extent of the labor
involved in its preparation, and the omis
sion of Congress to make any provision
either for tbe compensation or the expenses
the Commission, has been postponed un
tbe present time. It is herewith trans
mitted to Congress.
While the reform measures of another
Government are of no authority for us,
they are entitled to influence, to tbe ex
tent to which their intrinsic wisdom, and
their adaptation to our institutions and so
cial life may commend them to our con
sideration. The views I have heretofore expressed
concerning tbe defects and abuses in our
civil admiuisLration remain unchanged, ex
cept in so far as enlarged experience has
deepened my sense of the duty both of of
ficers and of the people themselves to co
operate for their removal. The grave evils
perils of a partisan spoils system of
appointment to office and of office tenure,
now generally recognized. In the res
olutions of the great parlies, in the reports
departments, in the debates and pro
ceedings of Congress, in the messages of
HiXecuuves, tbe gravity ol these evils has
pointed out and the need of their re
form has been admitted.
To command the necessary sunnort every
measure of reform must be based on com
mon right and justice, aud must be com
patible with the healthy existence of great
parties, which are inevitable and essential
a free Slate.
When the people have aPDroved a policy
a National election, confidence on the
part of the officers they have selected, and
the advisers who, in accordance with our
political institutions, should be consulted,
the policy which it is their duty to carry
effect, is indispensable. It is eminent
ly proper that they shonld explain it be
fore the people as well as illustrate its spir
it in the performance of theirofficial duties.
Very different considerations apply to
greater number of those who fill the
subordinate places in the civil service.
Their responsibility is to their superiors in
official position. It is their duty to obey
legal instructions oi mose upon wnom
authority is devolved, and their best
public service consists in the discharge of
their duties irrespective of partisan politics.
Their duties are tbe same, whatever party
in power and whatever policy prevails.
a consequence, it follows that their ten
ure of office should not depend ou the prev
alence of any policy or the supremacy of
party, out should be determined by
their capacity to serve the people most use
fully.quite irrespective of partisan interests.
same considerations that should gov
the tenure should also prevail in the
appointment, discipline ana removal of
these subordinates. The authority of ap
pointment and removal is not a perquisite
which may be used to aid a inend or re
ward a partisan, but is a trust to be exer
cised in the public interest, under all the
transactions which attend the obligation to
apply the public funds only for public pur
poses, i
Every citizen has an equal right to the
honor and profit of entering the public ser
vice of his country. The only just ground
discrimination is the measure of char
acter and capacity he has to make that ser- 1
most useful to the people, .except in
cases where, upon just and recognized
principles, as upon the theory of pensions,
offices and promotions are bestowed as re
wards for past services, their bestowal upon
theory which disregards personal mer
is an act ot injustice to tbe citizen, as
as a breach of that trust subject to
which the appointing power is held.
In the licrht of these principles it becomes
great importance to provide just and ad
equate means, especially for every depart
ment, and large administrative office,
where personal discrimination on the part
its head is not practicable, for ascertain
ing those qualifications to which appoint
ments and removals should have reference.
fail to provide such means is not only
deny the opportunity of ascertaining the
facts upon winch tbe most righteous claim
office depends, but. of necessity, to dis
courage all worthy aspirants, by handing
over appointments and removals to mere
influence and favoritism. If it is the right
the worthiest claimant to gain the ap
pointment, and the interest of the people
bestow it upon him, it would seem clear
a wise and just method of ascertain
ing personal fitness for office must bean
important and permanent (unction oi every
and wise government. It bas long
since become impossible, in the great of
fices, for those having the duty of nomin
ation and appointment to personally ex
amine into tbe individual qualifications of
more than a small proportion of those seek
ing office; and, with the enlargement of
civil service, that proportion must con
tinue to become less.
In the earlier years of the Government,
subordinate offices were to few in num-,
ber that it was quite easy for those making
appointments and promotions to personally
ascertain the merits of candidates. Party
managers and methods had not then be
come powerful agencies of coercion, hostile
to the free and just exercise of the ap
pointing power.
A large and responsible part oi tbe duty
of restoring the civil service to the desired
purity and efficiency rests upon the Presi
dent, and it is my purpose to do what is
within my power to advance such prudent
and gi'adual measures of reform as will
most surely and rapidly bring about that
radical cbange of system essential to make
our administrative methods satisfactory to
a iree and intelligent people. By a proper
exercise ot authority, it is in the power of
the iixeculiye to do much to promote such
a reform. But it cannot be too clearly un
derstood that nothing adequate can be ac
complished without co-operation on the
part of Congress and considerate and in
telligent support among the people. Re
forms whicn challenge the generally accept
ed theories of parlies, and demand changes
in the methods of departments, are not the
work of a day. Their permanent founda
tion must be laid in sound pnncipies, and
in an experience which demons! rates their
wisdom aad exposes the errors ol their ad
versaries. Every worihy officer desires to
make bis official action a gain and an hon
or to his country, but the people themselves,
far more than their officers iu public sta
tion, are interesied in a pure, economical,
and vigorous administration.
By laws enacted in 1853 and 1855, and
now in substance incorporated in the Re
vised Statutes, tho prat ice of arbitrary ap
pointments to the several subordinate
grades in the great departments was con
demned, and examination as to capacity,
to be conducted by departmental boards of
examiners, were provided for and made
conditions oi aumission to me puuiic ser
vice. These statutes- are a decision by
Congress that examinations of some sort,
as to attainments and capacity, are essen
tial to the well being of the public service.
The important questions since the enact
ment of these laws haye been as lo tbe
character of these examinations, and wheth
er official favor and partisan influence, or
common right or merit were to control the
access to the examinations. In practice
these examinations have not always been
open to woitby persons generally, who
might wish to be examined. Official pa
triotism and partisan influence, as a rule,
appear to have designated those who alone
were permit ted lo go before the Examining
Beards, subjecting eyen the examiners to
a pressure from the friends of the candid
ates very difficult to resist. As a conse
quence the standard of admission fell be
low that which the public interest demand
ed. It was almost inevitable that a system
which provided for various separate Boards
of Examiner with no common supervision
or uniform method of procedure, should
result in confusion, inconsistency, and in
adequate tests of capacity highly detri
mental to the public interests. A further
and more radical change was obviously re
quired. In the annual message of December,
1870, my predecessor declared that "Were
is no duty which so much embarrasses the
Executive and heads of departments as that
of appointments; nor is there auy such
arduous and thankless labor imposed on
Senators and Representatives as that of
finding places for constiiuents. The pres
ent system fails to secure tbe best men, and
often not even fit men for the public places.
The elevation and purification of tbe ciyu
service of the Government will be bailed
with approval by the whole people of the
United States. Congress accordingly
passed the act, approved March 3d, 18il,
"to regulate the civil service of the United
States and promote efficiency thereof," giv
ing the necessary authority to the Execu
tive to inaugurate a civil service reform.
Acting under this statute, which was in
terpreted as intended to secure a system of
just and effectual examinations under uni
form supervision, a number ef eminently
competent persons were selected for the
purpose, who entered with zeal upon the
discbarge of their duties, prepared, with
an intelligent appreciation of the re
quirements of tbe service, the regulations
contemplated, and took charge of the ex
aminations, and who, in their capacity as a
Board, have been known as tbe Civil ser
vice Commission." Congress for two years
appropriated the money needed for tbe
compensation and for the expense of car
rying on tbe work of. the Commission.
It appears from the report of the Com
mission, submitted to the fresident in
April, 1874, that examinations had been
held in various sections of the country,
and that an appropriation of about $25,
000 would be required to meet the annual
expenses, including salaries, involved in
discharging the duties of the Commission.
The report was transmitted to Congress by
special message of April 18th, 1874, with
the following favorable comment upon the
labors of the Commission: "If sustained
byjCongress I have no doubt the rules can,
after the experienoe gained, be so improv
ed and enforced as to still more material
ly benefit the public service and relieve
the Executive, members of Congress, and
the heads of departments, from influences
prejudicial to good administration. The
rules, as they have heretofore been enforc
ed, have resulted beneficially, as is shown
by the opinions of the members of the Cab
inet and their subordinates in the depart
ments, and in that opinion I concur." And
in the annual message of December of the
same year, similar views are expressed,
and an appropriation for continuing the
work oi the Commission again advised.
Tbe appropriation was not made, and.
as a conseq uence, the active work of tbe
Commission was suspended, leaving the
Commission itself still in existence. With
out the means, therefore, of causing qual
ifications to be tested in any systematic
manner, or of securing for the public ser
vice the advantages of competition upon
any extensive plan, I recommended in my
annual message of December, 1877, tbe
making ol an appropriation lor the re
sumption of the work of the Commis
sion. In the meantime, however, competitive
examinations under many embarrass
ments, have been conducted within limit
ed spheres in the Executive Departments
in Washington, and in a nninber of the
custom housesjandpostoffices of the prin
cipal cities of the country, with a view to
further test their effects, and in every in
stance, they have been found to be as sal
utary as they are stated to have been un
der the administration of my predecessor.
I think the economy, purity and efficiency
of the public service would be greatly pro
moted by their systematic introduction,
wherever practicable, throughout the en
tire civil service of the Government, to
gether with ample provision for their gen
eral supervision, in order to secure con
sistency and uniform justice.
Reports from the Secretary of the Inte
rior, from the Postmaster General, from
the postmaster in the city of New York,
where such examinations have been some
times on trial, and also from the collect
or of the port, the naval officer, and the
surveyor of that city, and from the post
masters and collectors in several of the oth
er large cities, show that the competitive
system, where applied, has, in various
ways, contributed to improve the public
service.
Tbe report shows that the results have
been salutary in a marked degree, and
that the general application of similar
rules cannot fail to be of decided benefit
to the service.
The reports of the Government ' officers,
in the city of New York especially, bear
decided testimony to the utility of open
competitive examinations in their respec
tive offices, showing that "these examina
tions, and the excellent qualifications of
those admitted to the service through
them, have had a marked incidental ef
fect upon the persons previously in the ser
vice, and particularly upon those aspiring
to promotion. There has teen, on the
part ot these latter, an increased interest
in the work and a desire to extend ac
quaintance with it beyond the particular
desk occupied, and thus the morale of the
entire force has been raised.
The examinations have been
attended by many citizens wbo have had
an opportunity to thoroughly investigate
the scope and character ot the tests and
the method of determining the results, and
these visitors have, without exception, ap
proved the methods employed, and sever
al of them have publicly attested their fa
vorable opinion.
Upon snch consideration I deem it my
duty to renew the recommendations con
tained in my annual message of December,
1877, requesting Congress to make tbe nec
essary appropriation for the resumption of
the work of the Civil Service Commission.
Economy will be promoted by authorizing
a moderate compensation to persons in the
public service who may perform extra la
bor upon or under the Commission, as the
Executive may direct.
I am convinced that if a jnst ' and ade
quate test of merit is enforced for admis
sion to the public service, and in making
promotions, such abuses at removals witb
out good cause and partisan and official
interference with the proper exercise of the
appointing power, will in a large measure
disappear.
OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE ABUSES.
There are other administrative abuses to
which the attention of Congress should be
asked in this connection. Mere partisan
appointments, and the constant peril of
removal without cause, very naturally
lead to an absorbing and mischievous po
litical activity, on the part of those thus
appointed, which not only inteferes with
due discbarge of official duty, but is incom
patible with the freedom of elections. Not
without warrant, in the views of several
of my predecessors, in the Presidential of
fice, and directly within the law of 1871,
already cited, I endeavored, ty regulation,
made on the 22nd day of June, 1877, to
put some reasonable limit to such abuses.
It may not be easy, and it may never per
haps be necessary, to define with precision
the proper limit of political action on the
dart of Federal officers. But while their
right to hold and freely express their opin
ions cannot be questioned, it is very plain
that they should neither be allowed to de
vote to other subjects the time needed
for the proper discharge of their official
duties, nor to use the authority of their
office to euforce their own opinions, or to
coerce the political action of those who
bold different opinions.
Reasons of justice and public policy,
quite analagous to those which forbid the
use of official power for tbe oppression of
the private citizen, impose upon the Gov
ernment the duty ot protecting its officers
and agents from arbitrary exactions. In
whatever aspect considered, the practice
ot making levies, for party purposes, up
on tho salaries of officers is highly demor
alizing to the public service and discredita
ble to the country. Though an officer
should be as free as any other citizen to
give his own raouey in aid of his opinions
or his party, he should also be as free as
any other citizen to refuse to make such
gifts. If salaries are but a fair compensa
tion for the time and labor of the officer, it
is gross injustice to levy a tax upon them
If they are excessive in order that they
may bear the tax. the excess is an indirect
robbery of the public funds.
I recommend, therefore, such a revision
and extension of present statutes as shall
secure to those in every grade ot official
life or public employment, the protection
with which a great and enlightened Na
tion should guard those who are faithful in
its seryice.
FOREIGN RELATIONS.
Our relations with foreiga countries
have continued peaceful.
With Great Britain there are still unset
tled questions, growing out of the local
of laws maritime provinces and the action of
provincial authorities, deemed to be in de
rogation of rights secured by treaty to
American fishermen. The United States
Minister in London has been instructed to
present a demand for $105,306.02, iu view
of the damages received by American citi
zens at Fortune Bay on tbe oth day ol Jan
uary, 1879. The subject has been taken
into consideration by the British Govern
ment, and an early reply is anticipated.
Upon the completion of the necessary
preliminary examinations, the subject of
our participation in the Provincial fisher
ies, as regulated by treaty, will at once be
brought to the attention of the British
Government with a view to an early and
permanent settlement of the whole ques
tion, which was only temporarily adjusted
by the treaty of Washington.
Efforts have been made to obtain the
removal of restrictions found injurious to
the exportation of cattle to tbe United
Kingdom.
Some correspondence has also occurred
with regard to the rescue and saving of
life and property upon . the lakes, which
has resulted in important modifications of
the previous regulations of the Dominion
Government on the subject, in the interest
of humanity and commerce.
In accordance with the joint resolution
of the last session of Congress, commission
ers were -appointed to represent the United
States at the two International Exhibi
tions in Australia, one of which is now in
progress in Sydney, and the other to be
held next year at Melbourne. A desire has
been expressed by our merchants and man
ufacturers interested in the important and
growing trade with Australia, that an in
creased provision shonld be made by Con
gress for the representation of our indus
tries at the Melboarne Exhibition of next
year, and the subject is respectfully sub
mitted to your favorable consideration.
THE NEW CABLE.
The assent of the Government has been
given to the landing, on the coast of Mass
achusetts, of a new and independent trans
atlantic cable between France, by way of
French Island of St. Pierre, and this coun
try, subject to any future legislation of
Congress on the subject. The conditions
imposed, before allowing this connection
with our shores to be established, are such
as to secure its competition with any ex
isting or future lines of marine cable, and
preclude amalgamation therewith, to pro
vide for entire equality of rights to onr
Government and people with those of
France in the use of the cable and pre
vent any exclusive possession of the privi
lege as accorded by France to the disad
vantage of any future cable communica
tion between France and the United
States which may be projected and ac
complished by our citizens. An import
ant reduction of the present rates of ca
ble communication with Europe, felt to
be too burdensome to the interests of our
commerce, must necesarily flow from the
establishment of this competing line.
The attention of Congress was drawn to
the propriety of some general regulation
by Congress of the whole subject of trans
marine cables by my predecessor in his
message of Deeember 7th, 1875, and I re
spectfully submit to your consideration
the importance of Congressional action in
this matter.
THE SPANISH QUESTIONS.
The questions of grave importance with
Spain, growing out of the incidents of the
Cuban insurrection, have been, for the
most part, happily and honorably settled.
It may reasonably be anticipated that the
commission now sitting in Washington,
for tbe decision of private cases in this
connection, will soon be able to bring its
labors to a conclusion.
The long-standing question in East
Florida claims has lately been renewed
as a subject of correspondence, and may
possibly require Congressional action for
its final disposition.
A treaty with the Netherlands, with re
spect to consular rights an,d privileges,
similar to those with other powers, has
been signed and ratified, and the ratifica
tions were exchanged on the 31st of July
last. Negotiations for extradition trea
ties with Uie Netherlands and with Den
mark are now in progress.
Some questions with Switzerland, in re
gard to pauper and convict emigrants,
have arisen, but it is not doubted that
they will be arranged uon a just and sat
isfactory lm'sis. A question has also oc
curred with respect to an asserted claim
by Swiss municipal authorities to exer
cise tutelage over persons and property of
Swiss citizens naturalized in this country.
It is possible this may require adjustment
by treaty.
With tho German Empire frequent
questions arise in connection with the
subject of naturalization and expatria
tion; but the Imperial Government bas
constantly manifested a desire to strictly
maintain and comply with all treaty stip
ulations in regard to them.
In consequence of the omission of Con
gress to provide for a diplomatic repre
sentative at Athens, the legation to Greece
has been, withdrawn. There is now no
channel of diplomatic communication be
tween the two countries, andtheexpedien
cy for one, in some form is submitted to
Congress.
Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy,
Portugal, Turkey and Belgium, contin
ue amicable, and marked by no incident
of especial importance.
THE EGYPTIAN OBELISK.
A change of the personal head of the
Government of Egypt has taken place.
No change, however, has occurred in the
relations between Egypt and the United
Slates. The action of the Egyptian Gov
ernment in presenting to the city of New
York one of the ancient obelisks, which,
possess such historic interest, is highly ap
preciated as a generous mark of interna
tional regard. If prosperity should at
tend the enterprise of its transportation
across the Atlantic, its erection ia a con
spicuous position in the chief commercial
city of the Nation will soon be accomplished.
CHINA AND JAPAN.
treaty recently made between Ja
pan and the United States in regard to
the revision of former commercial treaties,
it is now believed will be followed by sim
ilar action on the part of other treaty
powers. The attention of Congress ia
again invited to the subject of the indem
nity funds received some years since
from Japan and China, which, with their
accumulated interest, now amount to con
siderable sums. If any part of these funds
is justly due to American citizens, they
should receive it promptly; and whatever
may have been received by this Govern
ment in excess of strictly just demands,
should in some form be returned to the
nations to whom it equitably belongs.
The Government of China has signified
its willingness to consider the question of
the emigration of its subjects to the United
States with a dispasssonate fairness, and
to co-operate in such measures as may
tend to prevent injurious consequences to
the United States. The negotiations are
still proceeding, and will be pressed with,
diligence.
A question having arisen between Chi
na and Japan about the Loo Choo Islands
the United Slates jkvernment has takea
measurr.6 to inform those powers of its
readiness to ertend its good offices for the
maintenance of peace, u they shall mu
tually deem it desirable, and find it prac
ticable to avail themselves of the proffer.
RIO GRANDE RAIDS.
It is a gratification to be able to an
nounce that, through the judicious and en
ergetic action of the military command
ers of the two nations on each side of the
Rio Grande, under the instructions of
their respective Governments, raids and
depredations have greatly decreased, and,
in the localities where formerly most de-
st.mcuve, nave now almost wboljy ceased.
In view of this result I entertain a con
fident expectation that the prevalance of
quiet on the border will soon become so
assured as to justify a modification of the
present orders to our military command
ers as to crossing the border, witbout en
couraging such disturbances as wuld en
danger the peace of the two countries.
The third instalment of the award
against Mexico tinder the Claims Com
mission of July 4th, 1868, was duly paid,
and has been put in course of distribution
in pursuance of the act of Congress pro
viding for the same. This satisfactory
situation between the two countries leads
me to anticipate an expansion of our
tradewith Mexico and an increased con
tribution of capital and industry by our
people to the development of the great re
sources of that counlry. I earnestly com
mend to the wisdom of Congress the pro
vision of suitable legislation looking to
this result.
THE NICARAGUA CANAL.
Diplomatic with
is again fully restored by the arrival of a
minister from that country to the United
States. This is especially fortunate in
view of the fact that the question of an inter-oceanic
canal has recently assumed a
new and important aspect, and is now un
der discussiod with the Central American
countries through whose territory the
canal, by the Nicaragua route, would have
to pass. It is trusted that enlightened
statesmanship on their part will see that
the early prosecution of such a work will
largely enure to the benefit, not only of
their own citizens and those of the United
Stales, but of the commerce of the civiliz
ed world. It is not doubted that should
the work be undertaken under the pro
tective auspices of the United States, and
upon satisfactory concessions lor the right
of way, and its security, by the Central
American Governments, the capital for its
completion would be readily furnished
from this country and Europe, which,
might, failing such guarantees, prove in
accessable. Diplomatic relations with Chili have
also been strengthened by the reception
of a Minister from that country.
The war between Peru, Bolivia and
Chili, still continues. The United States
have not deemed it proper to interpose in
the matter, farther than to convey to the
Governments concerned the assurance
that the friendly offices of the Government
of the United States lor the restoration of
peace upon an honorable basis will be ex
tended, in case the belligerents shall ex
hibit a readiness to accept them.
Cordial relations continue with Brazil
and the Argentine Republic, and trade
with those countries is improving. A pro
vision for regular and more frequent mail
communication, in our own ships, be
tween the ports of this country and the
nations of South America, seems to me to
deserve the attention of Congress, as an
essential precursor of an enlargement of
our commerca with them, and an exten
sion of our carrying trrde.
A recent revolution in Venezuela has
been followed by the establishment of a
provisional government. The Govern
ment has not yet been formally recognized,
and it is deemed desirable to await the
proposed action of the people, which is
expected to give it the sanction of consti
tutional tonus.
A naval vessel has been sent to the Sa-
moan Islands to make surveys and take
possession of the privileges ceded to the
United States by Samon, in the harbor of
Pago fago. A coaling station is to be es
tablished there, which will be convenient
and useful to United States vessels.
The subject of opening diplomatie re
lations with Roumania and Servia, now
become independent sovereignties, is at
present under consideration and is the
subject of diplomatic correspondence.
There is a gratifying increase of trade
with nearly all European and American
countries, and it is believed that with ju
dicious action in regard to its develop
ment it can and will be still more enhanc
ed, and that American products and man
ufactures will find new and and expand
ing markets. The reports of diplomatic
and consular officers upon (bis subject,
under the system now adopted, have re
sulted in obtaining much valvable infor
mation, which has been and will contin
ue to be laid before Congress and the pub
lic fioui time to time.
The third article of the treaty with.
Russia, of March 30th, 1SH. by which
Alaska was ceded to the United States,
provides that the ceded Territory, with,
the exception of the uncivilized native
tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment
of all the rights of citizens of the I nited
States, and shall be maintained and pro
tected in the free enjoyment of their liber
ty, property, and religion. The unciv
ilized tribes are subject te such laws and
regulations as the Lntted States may from
time to time adopt in regard to the abor
iginal tribes ot that country.
Both the obligations of this treaty and
the necessities of the people require that
some organized form of government over
tlie Territory of Alaska be adopted.
There appears to be no law lor the ar
rest of persons charged with common law
offenses such as assault, robbery and mur
der, and no magistrate authorized lo issue
or execute process in such cases. Serious
difficulties have already arisen irom oi
fensesof this character, not only among
the original inhabitants, but among citi
zens of the United States and other coun
tries, who have engaged in mining, fish
ing and other business operations within
the Territory. A bill authorizing the ap
pointment of Justice of the Peace and
Constables, and the arrest and detention
of persons charged with criminal offenses,
and providing for appeal to Veiled
