ASIDE FROM STOCK FARMING AND RAISING OF CATTLE,
HOGS, SHEEP AND POULTRY HAS DEVELOPED RAPIDLY
SHEEP INDUSfRT ESPECIALLY MS HEAVY INCREASE
Many Farmers and Ranchmen are Adding Sheep to Their Possessions
and Find That it u Mott Profitable Sheep Raisers Organize
Association Lat Year for Better Marketing Conditions.
Aside from agr;cultural nduction
of th Plains country and the oppor
tunities here for development along
that I, in', nrt'l aside from the nmi'r
agricultural activity such as 'he

tered in the production of h .". heen
8 nd poultry. These i ri r i li . t r i are
a a rule, considered auxi'.ary to
agriculture because of the fact thai
they di riot absorb much of trip far
mers' time in trifir produrtior. or
re not rnnsidere l airr a-ul! jral nr
tivity which demand much attention.
The income, however, from this
source i very material in the- Plains
country.
To begin with the condition from
climatic standpoint a well a a
standpoint of feeding ar augmentive
to the extensive production of hogs,
sheep and poultry a well as dairy
ing, the Utter of which will he taken
up further on in thia campaign.
Diseases so common among live
stock are not found in this section.
The semi-high altitude is just right
for the rinsing of hou and special
ly the production of poultry. The
large amount of feed ruff produced
furnihei the feed and ample water
is always available. These are f rst
of all th most imjMirtdnt things in
the successful raising of auxiliary
agricultural crops
The hog situation in Lubbock
county and thia section of the Plain
thia year is far different than tn oth
er years for the reason that during
the two year period of adversity
which visited West Ti the fanners
found it necessary to depose of por
tion of their livestock. A a result
they shipped all the surplus animals
out and told them on the market. In
many instance farmers did not re
serve sufficient for home consump
tion. They did. however, lop their
herds of hogs and kept the very best
of the animals fur breed. ng purposes
and this year the situation is again
being very materially changed in Uiat
farmers are shipping in many ear
load of young hog as wed a breed
ing anir.iais and by nest year the hog
industry w.ll have assumed iU im
portant position agsin in the general
production of the Plain country
In many instances ih.s period of
advers.ty was far th test It ha
eliminated ail of the scrubby stock
from the plain country and the ani
mal that are being stunted in no
are in the ma:n pure bred stock and
thia i the cI.imi of annuals tnit th
f.rmer will cn'er their act.vity on
in the future The mi n breed re
nivtng favor in the Plain country
and in Lubbock county are trie P .!
md China and Duroc Jersey. The
principle shipments into Lubbock
county and adjoining counties this
year hue bet-n of these breed and
were shipped in largely for breed
ing purpose.
It la estimated by those interested
in th production of liv stock in th
county that nest year will s the
number of animal in the county for
breeding purpose more thaa doubl
ed and with th success that should
be accordid the raising of the ani
mal the thtpmenta next fall should
b exceptionally heavy and increas
ing each yer.
The interest in hog raising la be
ing matenafy augmented by the
Agricultural Department in that
boy .md gir pig Club ar being
organ, ied whh encourage competi
tive etfort alutg the tin of hog pro
duction and ia pen to both th town
a no: rural chihUa. Dozens of chil
dren in th coutty hav been induc
ed to buy on or more pure bred pigs
tn raise. EacJ cadd is given instruc
tion with ref-reace to th proper
feed and car that should be given
the animal to h.nn about the best de
velopment, ihi( all being done to
create interest in the industry anil
to encourage b,ter breeds.
The feed sitifciion is very condu
cive to hog rai-g. The production
of forage makesu absolutely unnec
essary, throughit a normal year,
for the farmers V buy on tingle
f t und of feed tt winter their ani
mal and during Ve growing season
the audun grass fVnishe the finest

The In' three yenr has shown al
nuKl a phenonienul prowth in the

t';i re was not riin h interest t.iken in
the rnntir of sheep in thu country

over ' lie e pw cmntrv. ThoM
who were interested in the ra sun'
of ra.tie were strotiir Hir.i'rut the
product. on of sheep, contend. nK that
;iie shien would spoil the cittle
r iriL'e. This theory has been d s
jiroven. however, during the two yenr
period of iidver.ty in th:it the slm'k
i, mn who rano'd sheep in corjiinction
with his catlie was ahb to weather
conditions much better th:in the far
mer who depended absolutely upon
he production of cittle, at the
sheep are able to thrive ard develop
on mucn loss ranee than other miu
malH and the percent of profit is
mn h hiirhrr.
! The rhantre in the industry c.ime
in 1!17 and at that tune there wis
in'y about a. OHO head of thee ani-
Imnia in the county. The following
ir such succena w is accorded nheep
ri s nif t hit the number of sheep in
the county was increased to I .."1111',
and th s year another material in
crease ha been made, the estimated
number of ieep being ra sed m the
county bemg 'J.,000 Those who are
ntereHted in the in'lustry state that
raany more thousand head will he
.brought in for wintering before
the season is over, which wJl in
crease the already suhstantiul gain
of about 10,l)(M over last year
The rominir of the sheep has also
brought another industry lo Lubbock
'which will prove to he an important
f.icfor in th development of the in
dustrial resource of this section
The wool product on from sheeyi nat
urally will all he centered in Lub
bock, this city being the leading
commercial center of the plains coun
try f ast year alone more than
."io.iHKt po'inii of wool was handled
ihmusrh the markets maintained here
for th s purpose. This wool old
from .!" to 5 cent per pound and
on the established sal-ca day Iti.i.OOO
pounds of the wool were sold at that
f rre. Thia will give the reader
some idea "f the importance of this
industry t the PUiins country and
the !ir-fe volume of money that it
will bring int.) the Lubbock terri
tory With its development. The Wool
nip th year w II without a question
-f a doubt evepn I that of last year
by more than lti') per cent.
Another important step in the en
couragement of the -beep raising in
.liia.ry in the plains country was
made th.s year with the organization
-if the Souih Pit n Sheep and Wool
throwers Association, this organizat
ion being brought about through the
activity of Mr Cairo. 1 Thompson,
County Agent, who ha been work
ing diligently to encourage interest
in sheep raising and through the co
operation of the Chamber of Cum
mere. Th purpose of th s organi
sation ia for the care of sheep and
the forming of plan for th hand-
ling of the wool crop to the greatest
advantage of th producers. The
laaaociation i planning to take nec
esaary step to encourage the raising
I of a uniform breed of animals in the
i county. Th organisation will also
' b an important factor in the buying
of breeding stock and will formulate
; plan to combine the shipping in car-
I load lot to make it possible for the
raisers of sheep to realize th largest
I per cent of profit possible from their
production.
Plans are now being formulated
for the building and establishment in
Lubbock of a large warehouse for
the storing and handling of wool. It
is now estimated that the wool crop
to be stored here will be in excess of
half a million of pounds which will
show the advancement that is being
made every year
The climatic condition of the
pla ns country is practically the
same as the Oxusk country in Mis
souri, which ia so noted for its poul
try production hence thia section i
well a hipted to the raising of poul
try. Th abundance of small grain
feeds ra sed by the farmer of thi
section makes th raising of Poultry
an inexpensive operation, in that the
fowls can forage for themselves,
there being no outgoing expense for
their upkeep and maintenance. If
poultry was not produced to feed on
this excess which is alway to be
I found around a barn yard where
small grain are stored this grain
would go to waste. Hence the rais
ing of poultry i looked upon as a
conservation method n well a prof
I itable,
The industry is well under way to
being sn Important on in this coun
ty in that It i conservatively estl
mated that ther are 1000 farm
home with an averae flock of 40
chickens, or a total of not less than
