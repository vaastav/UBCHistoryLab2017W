FINANCIAL
New York, Dec. 8.—The complexion
of Friday's stock market underwent an
abrupt change for the better this after
noon when speculators for the decline
were compelled to abandon their ef
forts on the short side because of their
failure to bring out any large volume
of stocks. Rails proved a vulnerable
target to early pressure, but industrials
offered better resistance and it was
the strong buying power appearing in
such leaders as Baldwin. United States
Steel common and Studebaker, that
turned prices upward again after noon.
The partial recovery in railroad
shares was stimulated by publication
of President Harding's message to con
gress approving railroad mergers and
the pooling of equipment and recom
mending abolition of the railroad labor
board and the substitution of a labor
division of the Interstate commerce
commission with power to enforce its
decisions. A
Studebaker continued to reflect the
favorable earnings report of the com
pany and speculative approval of the
directors' Intention to continue the $10
dividend rate on the new stock. Today's
closing price of 133% represented a net
gain of 2%. Other motors improved in
sympathy. Sugars were taken in hand
against and gains of 1 to 2% points
were recorded in that group by Amer
ican Beet Sugar, American Sugar, Cuba
Cane common and preferred, South
Porto Rican and Cuban American. Na
tional Lead established a new top at
119% on revival of reports of a stock
dividend.
Sales totalled 836,000 shares.
Religious holidays abroad resulted in
a reduced volume of business in foreign
exchange with rates generally firm,

The advance in sterling appears to
have been momentarily checked. Fri

the high of 457% Thursday.

BOSTON WOOL REVIEW
Boston, Dec. 8.—The Commercial
Bulletin will say Saturday:
"On the whole, the wool market has
been Quiet this week, although toward
the later half of the week rather more /
business was done in medium wools.
Prices held very firm as a rule, al
thou{;> ;iere and there some of the least)
•""" *• i
attractive wools have been available,
perhaps, at slight concessions from
asking prices. This, however, does not
always represent a decline in the mar
ket. Manufacturers rex^ort less business
in their products at the moment, but
they are watching the course of the
market closely on account of the im
minence of the heavy weight season."
The Commercial Bulletin will publish
wool quotations Saturday as follows:

Reported by H. B. Lake & t o
New York, Dec. 8.—Specialties again
featured the stock market Friday but
the undertone of the genera! market
can be said to have been steady, lire
stocks reflected recent price advances
in tires anc expectations of a S°°£
! business in this line of endeavor with
the approach of spring.
vhile were re
actionary, the selling being chlefiv
stimulated by disappointment over the
showing made by the combined rail
road earnings for October. We look
for specialties to feature the market
on the upside for & while. The presi
dent's message Friday and the more
hopeful political outlook abroad seem
to have promoted a more cheerful
feeling.

"The first real winter storm resulting
with cold or snow in northern areas
and rains further south, plus an in
crease in holiday buying, has served to
accentuate previous contracts between
retail "*vl jobbing trade on one hand
and pure, y wholesale distribution on
the other.
Retail buying is the first instance last
winter, heavy wearing apparel, foot
wear and holiday specialties predomi
nating. In this .atter direction, active
