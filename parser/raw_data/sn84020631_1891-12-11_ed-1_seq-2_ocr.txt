The Denver News calls attention to the
nnasihilitv that the El Paso silver conven
tion may take up, in the interest of Texas
smelters, the question of the free admis
sion of Mexico silver-lead ores. The New
Mexican weeks ago brought forward this
matter, and it has the positive assurances
of the chief promoters of the convention
that but two subjects are to be handled :
The free coinage of Bilver, and the repeal
of the alien act in so far as it effects mm
ing in the territories.
The Denver Republican has unearthed
a hornet's nest regarding rebates, draw
backs, special rates,' and that sort of a
thing, and it is showing Uiai mere i n
privileged class of merchants both east
and west who enjoy very intimate reia
Hnna with the irreat transportation lines.
Here's another chance for the inter
state commerce commission to do some
excellent work. Tbe Republican seems
to be on the right track, and ordinary
nonnin nwe it a debt of gratitude lor its
bold and vigorous methods of dealing
with the question of freight rates.
WITH A STRING TO IT.
Governor Hill, it must be admitted,
displays a good deal of courage in coming
out as he has for free coinage of silver,
but after all it is only a bait for the vote
of the Democracy of the west and south.
Hill practically says as much, but his
proposition is one that has a very stout
Tam man v atrina to it, for he argues that
no silver legislation must be attempted at
thiH session of congress. One tear is tnai
President Harrison might sign the bill,
and thus come in for a share of the hon
ors, or might permit it to become law for
the sake of "miss-adininistrating" it.
Hill's idea is that nobody but Hill and a
Democratic congress must be permitted
to give bi-metalism to the Unitad States,
Tbe canal system of the PECOS
enterable at the Government price, of
Aampness; no
fm tbo same
and he wants the whole question post
poned til! Hill et al get in. It will be
a cold day when that happens, therefore
let the battle propped now and at once.
JUSTICES OF THE PEACE.
Some confusion appears to exist res
pecting the time for the election of Jue
tices of the peace and other minor officers.
Several newspapers of the territory bave :
called attention to the subject, saying an
election for such officers would occur in
January next. This was formerly the re
quirement of the law, but it is so no
longer, chapter 113 of the session laws of
1889 having been amended by the last
legislature so as to bring the election of
justices of the peace, constables and
school directors on the second Monday in
January "of every other year," mayordo-
mos of acequias were stricken out of this
act altogether and their election restored
to its former date in March. Section 2
of the amended act reads :
"The term of office of justices of the
peace, constables and school directors
elected to their respective oflices on the
second Monday in January A. I). 1891,
shall expire on the first day of February
A. D. 1893."
So that the election for justices, etc.,
takes place one year hence.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
President Harrison's message to con
gress is a frank, manly statement of his
stewardship since congress last met. He
produces facts and figures to show the
prosperous condition of the country,
largely resulting unquestionably from the
policy of protection and reciprocity which
has been the watchword of this adminis
tration. The ample attention given to
finance shows the president is beginning
to respond to the sentiment of tbe times
as respects this subject. He thinks it
would be unwise to molest the existing
law relating to silver because of its'possi-
ble effect upon the commercial and indus
trial interests of the country, unsettling
them at a time when there is little pros
pect of bringing shout an international
agreement respoctiug the white metal as
money.
Bi-metalism is the desired end, says
Mr. Harrison, but he would first have an
arrangement with foreign nations whereby
all can act in one accord toward this end
He notes a growing sentiment abroad as
well as at home in favor of silver as money
and intimates that after the present law
is further tried, the government purchas
ing all American silver mined, the exist
ing system will promote a gold reserve
here that will more and more bring the
foreign nations to consider the advisability
of an international agreement for the
"full" coinage of silver as well as gold.
The president's position on this subject
is by no means unexpected except in one
feature. His utterances indicate an nn
portant mile stone of progress toward the
end so much desired by the west, " bi
metalism," and which, the president ad
mits, the majority of the people, along
with himself, desire to see attained.
Under the circumstances this admission
is a note-worthy one. It is a hint to the
gold-bugs that free coinage is now only a
matter of a very short time, and that they
may as well prepare for it.
