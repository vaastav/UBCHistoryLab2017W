A RELIGOUS WAR IN K. C.
A Bloody Battle Between the

Armed Fanatics Within
the Very Shadow of the
City Hall.
Kansas City, Dec. 8 In the very
shadow ..f the city hall in this city, and
less than half a mile frm the business
ci ntcr. a riot in which religious fan
atics and the police were participants
ar.ii in which a hundred shots were
fired, this aftcrno.m resulted in the
il-ath of one txdieeman, fatal injuries
to throe and slightly injuring two other
persons.
The dad man is Albert O. Darlow,
a patrolman.
Tin- fatal injured are: John Sharp,
yin.'wn as "Adam Ood." a street
lre;c ii r; Michael Mullane, a police
man and Patrick Clark, a police ser
geant. The slightly injured are: Harry E.
Stcgc, a policeman and Geo. M. Holt, a
probation officer.
The trouble occurred at 4 o'clock this
afternoon when the streets were crowd
ed. While the battle was in progress
the participants traversed an entire
block, the final stages of the fight be
ing enacted directly across from the
fritrar.ee to the police station.
ffii er Holt's suspicions were arous
ed by the manner in which a woman
attempted to secure money contribu
tions from the crowd and he decided
that she nn4 her male companions were
not the proper persons to have the cus
tody of young children. Officer Holt
accosted the w oman an inquired as to
the identity of the children. The wom

officer with physical violence. Officer
Holt was not armed and found himself
at a decided disadvantage when the
preacher and his companions displayed
revolvers. He stood his ground, how
ever, and "Adam God" struck him
heavy blow behind the ear, making an
ugly wound, with his revolver. Holt
started for the police station for as
sistance and as he moved; away the
preacher tried to shoot him but the
cartridge failed to explode.
Officer Holt rushed Into the police
station and warned the officers to pre
pare for trouble. The police sergeant
ordered Patrolmen Dalbow and Stegu to
go and arrest Sharp and his followers,
The religionists were within fifty
yards of the police station when the
officers stepped into the street. They
served notice that they would "preach
right under the eaves of the police sta
tion" and the police could not prevent
them.' The officers were not prepared
for the volley of bullets that met them
almost immediately after they appeared
on the scene.
Ialbow was instantly killed and a
bullet passed through, Stege's arm.
Other offiuers rushed into the street
and a general battle ensued, but the
officers were unable to shoot without
endangering the lives of other persons.
Clark was shot in the eye, and Patrol
man Mullane was shot in the back.
In. the meantime the riot call had
been sounded and polieemen were ap
pearing from all directions. The offi
cers crowded in on Sharp and his fol
lowers, firing as they went, but taking
great care not to injure any children
and when the firing ceased, "Adam
God" lay fatally ounded, shot through
the head and body.
The children, who in the early part
of the firing tugged at the garments of
the officers and tried to hamper their
efforts, ran into Poor Man's mission
where they Were later taken In charge
by the officers. It was learned that
Sharp's male companion was Louis
Pratt, the father of five children. He
was uninjured but wasaken in charge
by the police.
The woman and some children es
caped and fled to a houseboat where
th-fc- lived, on the river. The police,
fifty in number, followed. The woman
barricaded herself In the houseboat
where she defied the officers. Stand
ing cm the porch of the boat with a
shot gun she shouted to the officers:
"Come on. you fiends."
The boat was but a few feet from the
bank, and several officers, taking up
the woman's challenge, dashed forward.
The woman dropped her weapon and
taking two children ran to the back of
the boat, cut it loose and began to row
toward the middle of the Missouri riv
er. The officers called to her to stop, but
she only plied her oars snore vigorously.
Without another warning the police
fired a volley at the boat.. One of the
shots strnck Lota Pratt, aged thirteen,
tearing away the greater part of the
child's face. She died from her
wounds tonight. The woman then sur
rendered. She said her name was Mrs.
Pratt, and that she was the wife of the
companion of "Adam God" and mother
of the wounded child. .
Sergeant Clark is reported to be at
the point of death, while Patrolman
Mullane is not expected to live.

Washington, D. C Dec. 8. (Special.) The friends of statehood here were well pleased with the recom
'mendations of the president in his massage regarding separate statehood. -
Chairman Hamilton of the territories committee of the house said that he was unable at present to say
what action will be taken on the admission of Arizona as a state, as no meeting of the committee had been
held. He did not have the authority to spsak for its members.
Washington, D. C, Dec 8. The
last message o President Roosevelt
to the sixtieth congress follows:
To the Senate and House of.Repre -
sentatives:
The financial standing of the na-
tion at the present time is excellent,
and the financial management of the
nation's interests by the government
during the last , seven years has
hown the most satisfactory results.
But our currency system is imper-
feet, and It is earnestly to be hoped : a" agencies of interstate commerce,
that the currency commission will be ' and I believe that the national gov
able to propose a thoroughly good eminent alone .an exercise this right
system which will do away with the ' with wisdom and effectiveness so as
existing defects.
During the period from July i,
1901. to SeptemW 30, 1908, there was
an Increase in tire amount of money
in circulation of $902,99!..';99. The in
crease in the per capita during this
period was $7.(i. Within this time
there were several occasions when it
was necessary for the treasury de
partment to come to the relief of the
money market by purchases or re
demptions of United States bonds;
by increasing deposits in national
banks; by stimulating additional is
sues of national bank notes, and by
facilitating Importations from abroad
of gold. Our imperfect currency sys
tem has made these proceedings nec
essary, ajtd they were effective until
the monetary disturbance in the fall
of 1907 Immensely Increased the dif
ficulty of .ordinary' methods of relief.
By the middle of November the
available working balance in the
treasury had been reduced to ap
proximately J3.000.000. Clearing house
associations throughout the country
had been obliged to resort to the ex
pedient of issuing clearing house cer
tificates, to be used as money. In
this emergency it was determined to
Invite subscriptions for $30,000,000
Panama canal bonds, and tioo.ooo.noo
per cent certificates of indebted
ness authorized by the act of June
13, 1898. It was proposed to re-
deposit In the national banks the
proceeds of these issues, and to per
mit their use as a basis for addition
al circulating notes of national banks.
The moral effect of this procedure
was so great that It was necessary
to issue only 124,631,9X0 of the Pan
ama canal bonds and J13.43G.300 of
the certificates of indebtedness.
During the period from July 1, 1901,
to September 30, 1908, the balance
between the net ordinary receipts
and the net ordinary expenses of the
government showed a surplus in the
four years 1902. 1903, 1906 and 1907,
and a deficit in the years 1904, 1903,
1908, and a fractional part of the
fiscal year 1909. The net result was
surplus of J99.283.413.54. The fi
nancial operations of the government
during this period, based upon these
differences between receipts and ex
penditures, resulted in a net reduc
tion of the interest bearing,. debt of
the United States from $R7,141.040
to 1897,233.990. notwithstanding- that
there had been. two sales of Panama
canal bonds amounting In the aggre
gate to $54,631,980. and an issue of 3
per cent certificates of indebtedness
under the act of June 13, 1898,
amounting to $13,430,500. Refunding
operations of the treasury department
nder the act of March 14. 1900, re-
ulted in the conversion into 2 per
cent consols of 1903 of $200,309,400
bonds bearing higher rates of inter
est. A decrease of $8.687,9a6 in the
annual interest charge resulted from
these operations.
In short, during the seven years
and three months there has been a
net surplus of nearly one hundred
millions of receipts over expendi
tures, a reduction of the interest
bearing debt by ninety millions, in
spite of the extraordinary expense of
the Panam canal, and a saving of
nearly nine millions on the annual
interest charge. This is an exceed
ingly satisfactory showing, especi::lly
In view of the fact that during this
period the nation has never hesitated
to undertake any expenditure that it
regarded as necessary. There have
been no new taxes and no increases
ot taxes; on the contrary some taxes

j Corporate Combinations.
i As regards the great corporations
i engaged In interstate business, and
' especially the railroads, I can only
' repeat what I have already again
and again said in my messages to
the congress. I believe that unde
the interstate clause of the Conti
tion the United States has the com-
i plete and paramount right to control
both tc secure justice from, and to do
t Jtlce to. ti e great corporations
"'Pirn are me most important iactors

it is worse than folly to attempt to
pre.hibit all combinations as is done
by the Sherman anti-trust law. be
cause such a law can be enforced
only imperfectly and unequally, and j their initiative and business sagacity,
Its enforcement works almost as are advocating policies that would be
much hardship as good. I strongly . fraught with the gravest harm to the
advocate that instead of an unwise I whole country. To permit every law
effort to prohibit all combinations, less capitalist, every law defying
there shall be substituted a law corporation, to take action, no matter
which shall expressly permit combi-
nations which are In the Interest of
the public, but shall at the same
fimp give to some agency of the na
tional government full Kwer of con
trol and supervision over them, tine
of the chief feat ires of this control
should lie securing entire publicity in
all matters which the public has a
risht to know, and furthermore, the
power, not by judicial but by execu
tive action, to prevent or put a stop
to every form of improper favoritism
or other wrongdoing.
Additional Regulation.
The railways of the country"-should
be put completely under the inter
state commerce commission and re
moved from the domain of the anti
trust law. The power of the com
mission should be made thorough
going, so that it could exercise com
plete supervision and control over
the issue of securities as well as over
the raising and lowering of rates.
As regards rates, at least, this power
should be summary'. The power to
investigate the financial operations
and accounts of the railways has
been one of the most valuable fea
tures of recent legislation. Power to
make combinations and traffic agree
ments should be explicitly conferred
upon the railroads, the permission of
the commission being first gained
and the combination or agreement
being published In all Its details. In
the interest of the public the repre
sentatives of the public should have
complete power to see that the rail
roads do their duty by the public,
and as a matter of course this power
should also be exercised to see that
no injustice is done to the railroads.
The shareholders, the employes and
the shippers all have interests that
must be guarded. It is to the interest
of all of them that no swindling
stock speculation should be allowed,
and that there should be no improper
issuance of securities. The guiding
intelligence necessary for the suc
cessful building and successful man
agement of railroads should receive
ample remuneration; but no jnan
should be allowed to make money in
connection with railroads out of
fraudulent over-capitalization and
kindred stock gambling performances;
there must be no defrauding of in
vestors, oppression of the farmers
and business men who ship freight,
or callous disregard of the rights and
needs of the employes. In addition
to this the interests of the share
holders, of the employes, and of the
shippers should all be guarded as
gainst one another. To give any
one of them undue and improper con
sideration is to do injustice to the
others. Rates must be made as low
as -is compatible with giving proper
returns to all the employes of the
railroad, from the highest to the low
est, and proper returns to the share
holders; but they must not, for in
stance, be reduced in such fashion
as to necessitate a cut in wages of
the employes or the abolition of the

rtccj ii is very earnestly to ie wisnea
tu- fthat our people, through their repre
sentatives, should act in this matter.
It is hard to say whether most dam
age to the country at large would
come from entire failure on the part
of the public to supervise and con
trol the actions of me great corpo
rations, or from the exercise of the
necessary governmental power in a
way which would do injustice afad
wrong to the corporations.. Both the
preachers of an unrestricted individ
ualism, and the preachers of an op
pression which would deny to able
men of business the just reward of
i how iniquitous, in the effort to se
cure an improper profit and to build
up privilege, would be ruinous to
the republic and would mark the
abandonment of the effort to secure
in the industrial world the spirit of
democratic fair dealing. On the oth
er hand, to attack these wrongs in
the spirit of demagogy which can see
wrong only when committed by the
man of wealth, and is dumb and
blind in the presence of wrong com
! mitted against men of proierty or
by men of no property, is exactly
as evil as corruptly to defend the
wrongdoing of men of wealth. The
war we wage must be waged against
misconduct, against wrongdoing
wherever it is found; and we must
stand heartily for the rights of every
decent man, whether he be a man of
great wealth or a man who earns his
livelihood as a wage worker or a
tiller of the soil.
Reward for Enterprises.
It is to the interest of all of us
that there should be a premium put j
upon individual initiative and indi
vidual capacity, and an ample re
ward for the great directing intelli
gences alone competent to manage
the great business operations of to
day. It is well to keep In mind that
exactly as the anarchist is the worst
enemy'vof liberty and the reactionary
the worst enemy of order, so the men
who defend the rights of property
have the most to fear from the
wrongdoers of great wealth, and the
men who are championing popular
rights have most to fear from the
demagogues who in the name of pop-

HEPBURN LAW CHANGES
A Bill Designed to Put the
Citizens of the Country in
to Such a Shape that They
May be Quickly .Trans
formed into Soldiery.
Washington, Dec. 8. The business of
both houses of congress was confined
today largely to listening to the read
ing of the president's annual message,
but in addition a few bills were intro
duced in the senate and house, and in
the house a number of bills were sent
to conference, among them being one
providing for a new immigration sta
tion at Boston.
In addition the speaker announced
the appointment of Mr. Higgins, of
Connecticut to a place on the commit
tee on judiciaryvin place of Mr. Little
field, and Mr. Martin to a place on the
committee on Indian affairs, tn place
of Mr. Parker, deceased.
For the first time during the present
congress there was a call of the com
mittees of the house, but no measure
was reported by any of them. The
miscellaneous work of the senate con
sisted in the main to a reference to
executive session of about 1500 recess
nominations, which were today sent in
by tne president, and the adoption of
resolutions of regret on account of the
death of members of the house who
have passed away since the adjourn
ment last May. The senate adjourned
at 2 p.m., and the house at 2:35.
A CITIZEN SOLDIERY
A Bill By Which an Army of 2,000,000
Could Be Raised.
Washington. Dec. 8. The emergency
volunteer army measure, advocated to
day by President Roosevelt in his an
nual message was sent to congress and
a draft of the bill with an accompany
ing message was introduced in the
senate by Mr. Cullom. The president
says the bill is intended to replace tlje
present law, which was placed on the
statute books "piecemeal and hurriedly,
partly on the eve of the war with
Spain and partly after the hostilities
had actually commenced."
After declaring the present law to be
faulty and wholly- inadequate to a
speedy and proper organization of the
volunteer force, the president says the
bill proposed, which was drawn under
the supervision of the chief of staff of
the army, has the hearty approval of
the war department.
