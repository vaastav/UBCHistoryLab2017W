THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. I
T
SlIU President's message ia
Addressed to Congress more
ol the armistice, it denU with what CongreM ought to have
'done but litis not done to meet Itotnc needs. It urges domestic ad-.
justtnent indigjiciunblc if tlie United Slate i to liuve a fair start j
inbe ucw era. Tim incfMgu makes no mention of the present statu.,
of the I'caeo Treaty. Hut it leave no doubt us to what the hold-up'
dftbe treaty ha cost'the Nation by deferring consideration of home
problems.
The President believe Congress
house in order to thai men may work
and freedom. Fie would have Congress revise the income and excufV
'profits taxes to the end that they shall not di'ourage energy or.
remove incentive to now enterprise, lie would, have Congress estab
lish a national budget ylpni. sitpnlcmcntel by an audit to urcortuin
whether money appropriated by tho legislature has been spent ,
jJ'wiBely, economically and effectively."' lie would have imports en
couraged in order that thuy may
exports for which heavily burdened
wise pay. lie would, at the nunc time, protect the youthful Ameri
can dyo industrV against tho powerful assault of a' restored, (iennan
monopoly. He would have Congress live" up to pledge to provide
Vraployment and land for returning Koldiers. He would have ho
Federal Government stimulate the former to raise bigger crops, he
would have Federal uid applied to the development of forests and the
building of good.roads.
If, But it is when the President deal with Hie closely related prob
lems of the cosl of living, industrial unrest and the menaco of ram
pant radicalism that he become most cnrncrl.
,. To combat food profiteers he urge practical measure, such at
a timo extension of the I'ond Control Act and, legislation giving
Pedcral scope (o a cold Ptonige.law like thai of the .State of New
Jersey, which limit the tune food may be kept in Rtorage. and re
'.quircs that good taken out lmll bear tho date of their receipt,
i W't. declare, the Incident, "there can be1 no. fettled conditions
"leading to incnMed production and a reduction in tho cost of living
jif labor and capila; arc lo be nntagonij.1 inlc.nl of partners." Wha;
jit more, a Jong as labor and enpitnl remain at odd there will be
."food for radicalism." "The only way to keep men frpm ngitatiim
gainst grievances lo remove the 'grievances'."
Illcre the Presidential message makes its strongest plea. Itceog
nizing the right of workman to demand now ndjustmonta which
will, "make the conditions of his life and the lives of thosOjdcar to
Miim tolcruble and cjisv to bear," recognizing the right ofjjrjdiyjduals
(to strike, yet reeogui-'ing no Icr "tlie predominant right of Jjio Oov
( eminent to protect all of its people and to assert ita power, and
majesty against the challenge of any class," the President point to
jibe duty of Congress:
' "It must now help lu the difficult tuk Of finding a method
' that xrill bring about a genuine democratization of industry,
' based upon tho full recognition of the richt of thoso who work,
' .In whatever, rank, to participate in some ornaulc way in every
decision which directly affect their welfare."
'( And jnstead of leaving the settlement of industrial disputed to
conflict from which the public unjustly suffer, oflort must be made
to create some tribunal to which both capital and labor, without
declaring war, will como for .justice
It is by constructive measures to lessen injustice, tho President
argues, that radical and revolutionary propaganda can licat ba fought.
Nevertheless he would have Congress "arm tho Federal Government
with pow.er to deal in its criminal courts with thoso persons who by
'.violent methods would abrogate our time-tested institutions."
, "In America there is but one way by which treat reform)
can bo accomplished and Uio relief sought by clossca obtained,
and that la through the ordorly processes ot representative
Kovernuiunt. Those who would propose any other method ot
reform uro enemies of this country."
It should be impressed upon
' it' depends on them to strengthen
1 representative government,
In tho fight against those wlio agitate for change by Jawless
j methods, it is u paruinouiA duty of Congress to do its part and provo
its adequacy by grappling with injustice and mal-adjustment wlicre
ovor they menace the Nation'? safe progress through this critical

Tho Mayor was the principal speaker.
Ills address occasioned the incident

ter ot fact, tho trouble Is more often
than not so obscure that It is not
diagnosed uud Is regarded as almost
unything else, notably gout.
A New York pliyslctun has made a
deep study ot lead poisoning and con
tributed an extremely Interesting and
belplul paper un thn subject, to medi

he began to regard 'his condition as
hopeless, when the uuthurlty re
ferred to above saw him. He recog
nized tho symptoms, put him on
proper treatment aud ho recovered;
but what was the source of the lead?
Tho bottles containing tho tolt drinks
wero covered with old-lushloucd lead
stoppers)
In such extremely Innocent ways
may tho condition, of lead poisoning
be contracted; in tins casu tho con
tents of the bottles absorbed a sulll
clem amount of tho lead from the
stoppers to poison tho consumer.
Food Is often contaminated with
lead on standing In contain
ers that are soldered with lead;
pottery which Is gla:d with lead
oxid nolsons acid loods such as fruit
Jellies and the like. Somo years ago
ii considerable number of persons in

with symptoms of obactiro poisoning.
The matter was very thuruughly m

Again there was a laugh. It sbouVI

"Why ought I know?" snapped the
speaker.
"They tell me you're a great crap

It wus more than the Mayor coukl

small boys by shooting craps with
them but the accusation waa laid
to politics,
