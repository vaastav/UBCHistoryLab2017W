SAN PEDRO IS ALL RIGHT.
A Heep Water Harbor to Ke
Located There.
Report of the Army Engineers
to Congress.
The Verdict of the Examining- Board
Is Against Santa Monica.
House and Senate Proceedings—A Bill
Introduced for the Kepeal of
the Sugar Bounty—Wash
ington Motes.
By the Associated Press.
Wahuington, Dec. 7. —The report of
the board of army engineer officers to
make an examination relative to the re
spective merits of San Pedro and Santa
Monica bays, as a cite for a propoeed
deep water harbor on tbe Pacific slope,
was today submitted to congress. The
board reports that the unanimous
opinion is tbat tbe location selected by
tbe board of engineers of 1890, at the
present anchorage, at the westerly side
of San Pedro, under Point Firman, is
tbe more eligible location for such a
harbor, in depth, width and capacity, to
accommodate the largest vessels and the
commercial and naval ueceesitieß of the
country.
Tbe report of the board estimates the
cost of the proposed deep water harbor
at San Pedro bay at $2,885,324.
In considering the relative advantages
of the locations suggested, the board
says the proposed harbor should not be
primarily a port of refuge, but a port of
commerce. Tbe object, it cays, is to
provide a fine liaibor for foreign trade,
which will become of great importance,
and the coastiug trade a matter of sec
ondary importance. From a national
view, the capacity of a harbor for de
fense is a matter of tbe highest momea',
since an indefensible commercial port ih
simply an invitation of attack in time of
war. We have now too many such
ports, and it ia not desirable to increase
the number.
Contrasting the harbors of t-'an Pedro
nud Sanla Monica, it snya tbe deeo
water entrance at Ban Pedro harbor is
about one and one-half times as wide as
tbe eastern entrance to Santa Monica
harbor, BLd has a much better offing.
Santa Monica harbor ia free from hidden
dancers, but in San Pedro harbor there
is a rock covered by 18 feet of watpr.
The rock is not in the line of approach of
veesele, however, and is not considered
a eerious danger, but its removal in re
garded aa desirable.
Xbeßiiiliijgdistauc'rflfrc;n "i'Sc
porta are practically the same. As re
epecta the coasting trade, which iB prac
tically lumber, Santa Monica enjoys
about 25 miles advantage of San Pedro,
but this ia thought to be uuimnortant.
Should the Nicaragua canal be com
pleted, tbe board says, it ia predicted
tbat there will be a very great increase
in the fruit production "of Southern Cal
ifornia, and for prospective traffic San
Pedro will have tiie same advantage of
lesß sailing distance that Santa Monica
has in the lumber trade.
No estential difference is seen between
tbe two harbors as respects advantages
for the arrival and departure of veesels.
San Pedro harbor is regatded aa de
cidedly the best located as a place of
shelter and for the receipt nnd discharge
of freight; and also better adapted to
tbe construction aud maintenance of a
deep water harbor, as well as being
more cheaply defensible.
ARMAMENTS ON THE LAKES.
Tbe President Transmit! a Special Mes
sage to the Senate.
Washington, Dec. 7. —The. president
today, in answer to a resolution, trans
mitted to the senate the report of the
secretary of state on the agreement be
tween the United States and Great
Britain concerning armaments on the
great lakes. The resolution called for
an opinion whether the arrangement of
1817 is now held to be in force. The
secretary of state says correspondence
exchanged in 1804 shows that it is so
regatded. It does not appear, he says,
that any British or Canadian naval ves
sel is now, or has been for many years,
stationed on the lakes.
The report further Bays, however,
tbat it was recently learued by the
treasury department" that two vessels
recently constructed by the Canadian
government at Owen sound, styled reve
nue cutters, are in reality capable of
adaptation to naval purposes. Addi
tional weight is lent to thia suspect case
by the precautions taken to guard these
vessels from public inspection.
In closing, Secretary Foster says it
seems most desirable now, in view of
the lon/ lapse of time and the vast
changes wrought, that the arrangement
now grown obioletedo practice and sur
viving in letter only, as the declared
guarantee of international peace, should
be modified to fit the new order of
things and with such adaptation to tbe
exigencies of the future as prudence
may forecast.
CONGRESSIONAL PROCEEDINGS.
Bonator Vest Makes an Impassioned
Sp. cch • New Rills Introduced, Etc.
Washington, Dec. 7.—lv the senate
today, after tbe presentation of tbe
treasurer's report and the president's
message in regard to naval establish
ments on the great lakes, Hill intro
duced a bill to repeal the act of July,
1890, directing the purchase of silver
bullion. Referied to tbe committee on
finance.
Tbe resolution offered yesterday by
Vest, as to alleged partisan action by
employes of tbe census bureau, wns re
ferred to the committee on contingent
expenses.
The joint resolution introduced yester
day by Vest for tbe appointment of a
commission to make an agreement with
the Indians in Indian territory for tak
ing lauds in severalty and settling the
remainder of their lands was taken up,
and Vest made an impassirned speech.
Ue said tbe four adjacent states were
directly and immediately concerned in
the existing condition in Indian terri
tory. The territory today is a menace
to civilization. Crime is rampant and
corruption rife. The territory today
a depot for crime. Criminals from
adjacent states take refuge there and
from thence make raids. He instanced
the Dalton gang and referred to the fact
that come of tbe Dalton brothers were
at one time deputy marshals in the ter
ritory. Vest asserted that a large num
ber of the deputies in tbe territory were
tHken from the lawlesaclaeses. No such
monstrosity bad ever been known in
judicial annals as the system of organ
ized plunder practiced in the United
States courts there, the whole object of
the officials being to obtain fees.
The resolution went over without ac
tion.
The formal announcement of the
death of Representative McDonald hav
ing been announced, tbe senate ad
journed.
HOUSE PROCEEDINGS,
In the house, today, a bill in effect re
pealing tbe law which provides for tbe
reduction of the force of engineer offi
cers in tbe navy to 170 was brought to
the attentiou of tbe bouse. Although it
received a majority vote a motion to re
consider prevented final action. The
remainder of tbe day was consumed in
conaideration of the senate bill relative
to public printing and binding.
A bill, having for its object the es
tahliphment of a uniform revenue cus
toms duty upon sugar aud tbe abolish
ment of the payment of Bugar bounties,
was introduced in the house today by
Harter of Obio. It providea that after
February Ist next a uniform duty of
half a cent a pound shall be levied on
all grades of sugar imported, and the
payment of all bounties cease.
NEXT YEAR'S APPROPRIATIONS.
The statement prepared by the clerks
of the house and senate committees on
appropriations shows tbat the estimates
for the regular annual and permanent
appropriations for the fiscal year 1893 4
aggregate $5(!5,8b1,335, an increase over
the estimate for the current fiscal year
of $15,929,241, and over the appropria
tions (exclusive of deficiencies and mis
cellaneous) of $17,375,260. The ap
propriation?, however, included $21,
--154,218 for rivers and harborp, for which
no estimates were made. The appro
priations, of course, never equal the es
timates, but on the other hand, no
deficiency or miscellaneous appropria
tions are included in the estimates.
They do not include anything for livers
and harbors, on account of which the
chief of engineers estimates that $58,
--004,950 cau be profitably expended.

AN AI.AItMING TEST.
The Mediterranean Flour Moth Creating
Havoc In California.
San Francisco, Dec. 7.—The Morning
Call has been investigating tbe subject
of tbe presence in tbe flour mills of this
city and the state of the Mediterranean
flour moth, and declares tbat it h?a al
ready become an alarming pest, result
ing in the loes of thousands of dollars to
a number of large establishments, end
tbat it will result in still greater
loss before long. The statements
are baaed mainly upon interviews
with W. (i. Johnson, profeeßor of ento
mology in Stanford university, and with
a number of flour manufacturers. They
state tbat there is hardly a mill in tbe
state which is not affected by the moth,
and that all efforts to eradicate it have
been unsuccessful. The moth is contin
ually spinning strands of silk in great
quantities, which not only get into tha
flour, but also cog the " machinery so
badly tbat tbe mills are obligee! to
shut down temporarily. Professor
Johnson, who has made a careful study
of the subj?ct, eaya he baa discovered
that the moth propagates and matures
more rapidly in this climate than in
Canada, the eastern part of tbe United
States aud other cold countries where it
has appeared, lie exDects that the dis
astrous effects of this jooth will be very
apparent in nearly all the mills of the
state before tiie end of another year, as
it is almost impossible to drive out tbe
pest.
IN THE BLIZZARD BELT.
A Blfi SNOW STORM IN KANSAS AND
NEBRASKA.
Cnta Drifted Shut aud Trains at a Stand
still—Several Disasters Reported.
Cyclones in Texm and
Arkansas,
Kansas City,
blizzard of the winter in Kansas haa
been sweeping over tbe state for the
past 24 hours. The high wind haa
blown the snow into huge drifts in the
northern part of tbe state, aud tbe rail
roads traversing that section are either
completely blockaded or suiter from se
verely impeded trarlic.
Sr. Joseph, Mo., Dec. 7.—Two trains
from Denver, on the Rock Island road,
are snow bound, one at Phillipsburg,
Kan., and the other at Holtori, Kan.
The Grand Island road reporia one
blockaded train at Hanover. The Santa
Fe reports trarlic on the line not seri
ously impeded by the snow storm in
Kansas. Trains are late, however. Dis
patches at midnight state that the storm
has abated.
Omaha. Neb., Dec. 7.—Within a radius
of 11)0 miles of Omaha last night the
storm partook of the nature of a blizzard,
although the temuerature waa moder
ate. For about 14 hours enow fell in
driving clouda, carried along by a Btiff
gale fro n the north. Kepi ita received
here tonight indicate a general
blockade. In the city trarlic is
generally suspended and.' the electric
street car lines are so thoroughly block
aded that it will be at leant two dava
before they will run again. But few
serious accidents are reported. The
Burlington east-bound flyer collided
with a light engine 'four miles
west of South Omaha, and both en
gines were wrecked. The engineer
aud firemen escaped injury, but Wm.
E. Booth of Troy, N. V., stealing a ride
on the mail car, had both His legs ao
badly mangled aa to necessitate ampu
tation, lie may die.
The Chicago uml Northwestern west
bound Oyer wan deiailed near C uncil
Bluffs and delayed several hours, hut no
one was injured. The storm has abated,
but the teuipeiatuie is falling.
Atchison, Kan , IX c. 7.—Reports at
the office of Superintendent C. M.
Rathburn of the Missouri Pacific are
that a snowstorm is raging in Northern
Kansas and Nebraska. Snow in the cuts
between Nebraska City and Union ia
three feet deep, and freight trains have
been abandoned. The wires on the
central branch of the road are
dowu, and nothing can be heard
from trains west, of Wytmore; snow
plows bave tiecn sent out.
The street car company in this city
has not turned awheel today, and the
streets are deserted ou account uf the
storm.
Chicago, Dec. 7.—Advices to the As
sociated l'rets show that snow is falling
in lowa and Kansas. Borne tine snow
fell here today, but melted rb it fell. In
parts of lowa it is accompanied by «
high wind with the iudichtion of a buz
zard.
Camden, Ark., Dec. 7.—A heavy wind
