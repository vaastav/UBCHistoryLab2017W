Yacht club
In the presence
last August,
of
witnesses a replica
of Capt. Hains' revolver will be flred
to prove that seven shells in the wea
pon can be discharged within 15:8
second*. It is hoped by counsel that
the evidence,
allowing
with which the
the rapidity
weapon
will refute t.he
is discharged
state's
contention that
while the shooting
of
Annis was in
progress Thornton Hains drew his re
volver and prevented Annis' friends
from coming to his assistance. Fred
erick Storm, a real estate dealer, was
one of the principal witnesses under
cross-examination this morning. It is
generally believed by counsel that the
trial will hardly be concluded before
the end of the year.
Frederick A. Storm In his testimony
yesterday stated that the defendant
had inquired as to the whereabouts
of Annis shortly before the latter
sailed UP to the dock where he was
shot. Thornton Hains stopped talking
about real estate and asked me where
Annis was," said the witness. "I
pointed out Annis' boat, then sailing
toward the float." The shooting of
Annis followed.
Mr. Storm said that be then was
rowed out to the hoat which he was
to sail in the race. The witness said
I ha heard the shooting from his boat.
"I came quickly to the dock to see
what had happened. I saw Thornton
Hains and his brother. They were
Bitting on an upturned boat.
"Before being taken away from the
'yacht club I heard the defendant say
something on the pathway."
"What was it?"
"I asked him what in the world he
did it for. and he replied:
'Jf
he had
done to me what he did to him, I
would have done the same thing.' and
Capt Hains turned and said 'you keep
out of this.'"
A motion to strike from the record
what Hains said was granted by
1
Judge Crane.
It is upon this statement of Storm
that the prosecution hings its conten
tion that the Hains brothers hunted
up Annis for the purpose of killing
him and that the real estate inquiry
at tba yacht club was a blind.
DroTe Witness Back.
Other Important testimony was giv
en yesterday* by Charles Birchfield, a
friend of Annis, who declared that
Thornton Hains drove him back with
a drawn revolver when he sought to
stop the shooting. Thornton Hains
also drove Mrs. Annis from the float
with bis revolver, according to Birch
field.
Frank EHerson, a negro of Bayside,
took the stand. He was a waiter at
the yacht club at the time of the shoot
ing. He said that two men came to
the club on the afternoon of August
16 and he had a short conversation
with them about real estate. It was
shown through Mr. Birchfield, who
waa recalled, that these two men were
the defendant and his brother, Capt.
Hains.
"One of the men asked me," said
Ellovson, "if I knew Mr. Annia and
when be could be found."
Elierson on cross-examination said
he was not certain that the persons
who ealled at the club house were th?
persons who were pointed out on the
dock after the Bhooting.
Frederick A. Storm, a real estate
dealer and member of the Bayside
YaeM club, took the stand.
Storm said he went to the yacht
club on the afternoon of August 15.
"Mr. Birchfield came to me at the
club and I went down to the dock and
aaw Mrs. Annis, two other women and
a man whom I have since learned was
T. J. Balsa.
"A real estate conversation was
brought up and I told him that I was
willing to give up the race to earn a
commission. He said be would do
business with Jesperson, of whom I
new heard, because "he could get a
I better commission.
"Nothing more was said about real
satals and Thornton Hains asked
'where la Annis 7* and I pointed out
Annia* boat."
Missing Witness Fonnd
I John Tonnlng, the boatman who
siesed Captain Hains by the wrist at
the time of the Shooting. and who has
{been missing since early in October,
I ha* bee* located and will likely be a
witness in the case.

KILLED MOTHER
Removed Gas Tube From the
Range While Mother Slept
Nearby
Pittsburg, Dec. 18.—Mrs. Charles
Gardner was asphyxiated and her hus
band so seriously burned about the
arms, face and head that death may
follow, in a gas explosion last night
at their home in Cheswick. The gas
came from a range from which the
tube had been removed by a 2-year
old babe while the mother slept near
by.
When Gardner, who is employed in
a distillery, returned home at 7.15 o'
clock last evening the door was locked
and his 10-year-old son was waiting
outside. On entering Gardner smelled
gas and found his wife lying on the
kitchen floor. Setting down a lantern
he had been carrying he took the wo
man to a porch. Returning he picked
up his 2-year-old baby, Carl, but be
fore he reached the door the lantern
ignited the gas. The explosion blew
out the rear portion of the house. To
save the infant Gardner threw him
self upon the floor, shielding the child
under him. With his clothing ablaze
he crept from the burning debris, and
reached the yard, where he fell un
conscious.
The child's clothing was on lire, but
neighbors saved the Infant and drag
ged Mrs. Gardner out. Doctors say
Mrs. Gardner was dead before being
taken from the house. Gardner was
taken to a house nearby. The family
moved from Pittsburg a week ago,
when Gardner got employment at the
distillery. From the description Gard
ner gave of the interior of the house
when he found his wife It is thought
the mother, who had been amusing
the child on the floor, fell asleep, and
the baby in its play pulled a hose
connection from a lighted gas range.

Cargo of Oil Aflame Required
Heroic Action—Riddled
With Shot
Singapore, Dee. 18—The burning

ed by the harbor fort today and final
ly sank, with her hull riddled with
solid shot. The flaming steamer,
which halls from England, arrived in
Singapore from New York two days
ago with her cargo of case oil on fire.
All attempts to extinguish the blaze
were unsuccessful and an effort was
made to scuttle the vessel. This fail
ed also and the danger to the ship
ping became serious. It was impos
sible to go near the craft because of
the possibility of an explosion and
finally the harbor agents appealed to
the gunners of the fort, who sank the
Kalam Kaloma with a few well direct

six Inch guns. The distance was two
miles.

When Requested Will be Pursued.
Washington, Dec. 18.—That the sen
ate committee on interoceanic canals
is prepared to take up any sort of an
investigation of the canal affairs that
may be demanded by any member of
the committee, was asserted today by
Senator Klttredge of South Dakota,
chairman of the committee. Thus far
there have been no demands upon the
committee and as there has not been
a meeting at the present session of
congress it cannot be ascertained what
action will be taken.
"It has been the policy of the senate
committee," Bald Mr. Klttredge today,
to call witnesses at any time a de
mand is made by any member of the
committee and I propose to continue
that policy."
The demand, if It comes, probably
will originate with the Democratic
members.
The senate has not taken with any
seriousness the charges made by the
New York World which were the sub
ject of the president's message which
has started the discussion of the canal
deal afresh.

JURYWLEIE
The Trial of Notorious Reel
Foot Lake Band Now on in
Earnest
Union City, Tenn., Dec. 18.—Two un
expected surprises sprung by the state
on the second day of the trial of the
eight night riders indicted for the
murder of Captain Quentin Rankin,
resulted In the completion of the jury
late yesterday afternoon, and will
shorten the time of the trial.
The state as soon as court opened,
filed an affidavit, charging that J. H.
Russell, the first of the two Jurors
chosen, was the father of a night
rider, that his son had participated
in several of the midnight rides of the
band and would be used as a witness
at the trial. Juror Russell was ex
cused by the court.
When the next talesman was sum
moned and examined, the defense at
tempted to challenge him peremptor
ily. The state raised the point that
the defense having used twenty-six
peremptory challenges, had exhausted
its legal number and two more.
The court promptly ruled with the
state, and ordered the case to pro
ceed.
This left the defense with no further
right to object to talesmen who could
qualify to the satisfaction of the state
and court The work of selecting the
jury then proceeded very rapidly to a
conclusion.
Just half of the jurors are citizens
of Union City, the others being resi
dents of towns in the vicinity. Not a
single resident of the Reelfoot Lake
or Hill county was selected.
The jury was completed late this
afternoon, and court at once charged
it as to its duties, warning the mem
bers that communication with outsid
ers will not be permitted during the
trial. The attorneys on both sides
agreed to an adjournment until to
morrow when the taking of testimony
will commence.

THE BIO GAME
President Will Turn Over Specimens
to Smithsonian
Washington, Dec. 18—The agree
ment between President Roosevelt
and the Smithsonian institute, aB to
the president's hunting trip in Africa
was made public today by Charles D.
Walcott, ^secretary of the Institution,
after he had conferred with the pres
ident. At a meeting of the board of
regents of the institution held yester
day the letter of the president was
laid before the board, which in turn
adopted the resolution given, ^thereby
entering Into a contract with the
president for certain work. The let
ter and resolution follows:
"The White House, Washington.
Oyster Bay, Ny., June 20. 1908.
My Dear Doctor Walcott:
"About the first of April next I in-"
tend to start for Africa. My plans of
course are indefinite, but at present
I hope .they will be something on the
following order:
"By May first I shall land at Mom
basa and spend the next few months
hunting and traveling in British and
German east Africa probably going
thence to or toward Uganda:, with
the expectation of striking the Nile
about the beginning of the new year,
and then working down it, with side
trips after animals and birds, so at
to come out at tidewater, say about
March first. This would give me ten
months in Africa. As you know, I
am not In the least a game butcher.
I like to do a certain amount of hunt
ing, but my real and main interest
is the interest of a faunal natural
ist. Now, it seems to me that this
opens the best chances for the na
tional museum to get a fine collec
tion not only of big game beasts, but
of the smaller animals and birds of
Africa and looking at it dispassion
ately, I believe that the chance ought
not to be neglected. I will make ar
rangements to pay for the expenses
of myself and my son, but what I
would like to do would 'be to get one
or two professional field taxiderm
ists, field naturalists, to go with me,
who should prepare and send back
the specimens we collect. The col
lection would thus go to the national
museum would be of unique value.
It would, I hope, include specimens
of big game, together with the rare
smaller animals and birds. I have
not the means that would enable me
to pay foT the field naturalists or
taxidermists and their kit, and the
curing and transport of the spec!
mens for the national museum. Of
course the actual hunting of big game
I would want to do myself or have
my son do but the specimens will
all go to the national museum, save
a very few for personal trophies of
little scientific value which for some
reason I might liUI to keep. Now,
can you, in view of getting these
specimens for the national museum,
arrange for the services of the field
taxidermists, and for the care and
transportation of the specimens?
As ex-president, I should feel that
the national museum is the museum
to which my collection should go.
With high regard, sincerely yours,
—^"Theodore Roosevelt"

THE WIN
The Payne gill Will be Con
structed From a Different
Standpoint
Washington, D. C., Dec.Y18.—In the
opinion of tariff students who watched,
the framing of the McKinley, Wilson
and Dingley tariff bills and are now
on the ground to watch the making
of the Payne .bill, the "utlimate con
sumer" stands a better chance to get
some of his just deserts than he ever
has before. In view of the fact that
there remains In congress every man
who has hitherto earned the rank of
"stand-patter,'" the underlying reason
for this situation is an item of deep
interest.
All Changed by Taft.
The attitude of President-elect Taft
and of those who spoke in his behalf
throughout the past campaign has put
the whole, tariff issue on a different
plane than ever before. He stands op
enly for the benefit of the consume
and, It is understood, insists that ev
ery schedule, which can be lowered
without Impairment of industry and
reasonable profit shall be lowered for
the consumer's benefit.
In this connection there are rumors
that the house committee on ways
and means proposes to originate a
"good" tariff bill, and that it wijl
throw upon the senate tho burden of
making the bill otherwise than a
"good" bill, meaning that the interests
must look to the upper body for
amendment it not satisfied with the
action of the house.
No Campaign Promises.
The committee has also had its eyes
opened by reason of the fact that no
witness has yet appeared before It
bearing a letter of indorsement from
National Chairman Frank H. Hitch
cock Indicating that promises had
been made In return for campaign
contributions. It is probably the first
time in history that at least one such
letter has not been produced by some
body during the tariff bearings. Mr.
Taft is. therefore. In a peculiarly
strong position to talk back to con
gress.
Arguments for Some Hl*h Duties.
A strong argument favoring reten
tion of many high duties has been the
unqeustlonable prosperity of most In
dustries undfcr them. Other argu
ments equally potent must be thrown
Into the equation, in- an analysis of
the motives which may prompt the
committee.
For instancs, it Is now urged by
high protectionists that there is more
danger to the boot and shoe industrv
In the removal of the duty on hides
than In letting It' remain. CalfBkins,
goatskins and sheepskins are now on
the free list, and it is suggested that
the farmer population will resent an
attack on the hide duty to the point
of forcing these articles upon the du
tiable list.
The raw wool duty could not be
touched without certain retaliation on
woolens and even the free trader must
recognise that the woolen industry
—reared as an artificial basis from the
bottom up. Is in a worse position than
any other to withstand serious dis
turbance. The doctrine that free raw
materials would incroaao consumption
and improve quality, and thus protect
prices, does not for a moment enter
into thtf calculations of political re
visionists.
American System Transported.
Reverting to instances where duties
on manufactures might appear to bo
'V"
needless, as on boots and shoes, anoth
er embarrassment faces the commit
tee. Some'industries have prospered
and grown independent of protection
through thf superiority of the Amer
ican- system of manufacture, particu
larly' in the use of machinery. Now
thlB system is being transported bodily
to foreign countries, notably by the
United Shoe Machinery company and
tho prediction is made that a few
years of free shoos will witness a for
eign competition that will compel a
resort to protection.
The reductionist's reply to this ar
gument always has been that the Am
erican operative, through the superior
intelligence developed by our educa
tional system and his mode of living
Is morO resouroeful, Inventive and
skillful than the foreigner and that the
value Of his,
output never can be du
plicated anywhere else.
Gold comfort has been extended to
several petitioners, like those for the
duty on zinc, ore, who hays asked for
duties while still controlling the do
mestic market and for no other.pur
pose than to discount the future-
Possibilities- 1b Reciprocity.
There Is still another phase to this
question which baa not been brought
out at the hearings—the reciprocity
phase, as It were. That Is to say, the
particularly In the direction of Can
committee could seek for instances,
ada, where a duty could be traded off,
when American interests were not
menaced and foreign were benefited,
for some duty which now obstructs
exports from the United States. The
Payne plan of a maximum and min
imum tariff, being retaliatory, does
not contemplate exchanges of this
kind and that is considered one of
Its weaknesses.
Maximum and Minimum Criticised.
The maxlmum-and-minimum Idea,
by the way, does not appeal to many
high-protectionists who otherwise are
in complete sympathy with the ruling
spirits of the committee. Col. Albert
Clarke for example, secretary of the
Home Market club, always has main
tained that one of the conspicuous
merits of the protective tariff is its
uniformly even application to all coun
tries, and that the moment the United
States begins to treat one nation bet
ter or worse than another it will
breed trouble for itself.
Other men equally favorable to high
protection desire the double tariff be
cause of their hatred and fear of Ger
many as an industrial rival.
Contention Over Drawbacks.
The drawback has sometimes cut an
Interesting figure In the testimony of
the witnesses. This Is a device about
which there has been much acrimon
ious contention among economists. It
is lauded by the high protectionists
for its use in developing foreign trade
without lessening the danger of for-,
eign competition. It is condemned by
free traders as offering unfair ad
vantages to foreign over iomestic con
consumers,
Cheaper to Make Rails for Europe.
"We can. manufacture rails for ex
port more cheaply than we can man
ufacture rails for delivery in the Unit
ed States," he said.
"Why?" asked Mr. Cockran.
"Because we use very largely Im
ported iron ores, on which we obtain
a rebate of the duty which we pay
when the iron comes into this country.
We also use very largely Imported
Imported spiegeleisen. We obtain also
a rebate there amounting to 99 per
cent for the duty."
The illustration quoted is interest
ing, for the drawback, unlike other
features of the protective system, ad
mittedly gives an advantage to the
foreign consumer while also benefiting
the domestic manufacturer.

Through Diplomatic Sources
'Which Seemed Reliable
REPORT DMEHTED ABROAB.
DEMED MJjjESIDEXT CKSIRQ
Nation Is Unable to Carry on an Of
fensive Campaign and Holland Will
Pursue Only a Retaliatory Course
Af She Has In (be Past
Washington, Dec. 16.—Something of
a flurry was caused in diplomatic cir
cles over the report which generally
obtained that Venezuela had deolared
war againBt Holland. Theae reports
had their foundation in the dispatch
which came to the state department
by way of Bogota from Caracas, say
ing that the government had declared
a state of war. It was soon pointed
out, however, that this announcement
was based on Vice President Gomez'
declaration that the country la in a
state of defense because of Holland's
act in seizing the coast guardship
Alexis.
Ofilclals Interested in the situation
profess to see no actual difference
between a "state of war," and a "state
of defense," taking the position that
It is a case of distinction without a
difference. A renewal of the demon
strations against the administration
of President Caatro would not be Bur
prising to the state department.
8hould the feeling against the presi
dent develop to the extent of an open
revolution and consequent, overthrow
of his government, the state depart
ment, it is understood, would lose no
time in resuming diplomatic inter
course' with the new administration.
Castro's DeniaL
Berlin, Dec. 18.—Both the German
foreign ofiice and President Castro
discredit the report that Venezuela
has declared war against The Nether
lands. The foreign offices takes the
ground that even it hostilities have
been declared the declaration cannot
become effective because Venezuela Is
in no position to carry a campaign be
yond its own borders and Holland will
not exceed the limits of its retaliatory
course as already fixed and known to
the United States. The feeling is also
growing* heta^that President Caatro
left South America not because of ill
ness but to escape the political tur
moil and that he has no Intention of
ever returning. The German govifftn
