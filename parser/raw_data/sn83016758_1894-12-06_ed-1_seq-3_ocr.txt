Washington, Dec. 3.Following Is the
prc-sideit's message:
To tbe Congress of the United States:
The assemblage within the nation's legis
lative halla of those charged with the duty
of Halting laws for the benefit of a generous
an free preple, impressively suggests the
exacting obligation and inexorable responsi
b'llty involved in thtir task. At the thres
hold of such labor now to be undertaken
by the congress of the United States and
In the discharge of an executive duty enjoin
ed by the constitution, I submit this
communication, containing a brief state
ment of the condition of our national af
fairs and recommending such legislation as
stems to be necessary and expedient:
The history of our recent dealings with
other nations and our peaceful relations
with them at this time additionally demon
strate the advantage of consistently ad
hering to a firm but Just foreign policy,
free from envious or ambitious national
schemes and characterized by entire hon
est and sincerity.
Offer to Mediate.
Acting under a stipulation in oar treaty
with Corea (the first concluded with a West
ern power), I felt constrained at the begin
ning of the controversy to tender our good
offices to induce an amicable arrangement
of the initial difficulty growing out of the
Japanese demands for administrative re
foims in Corea but the unhappy precipita
tion of actual hostilities defeated this
kindly purpose. Deploring the destructive
war between the two most powerful of the
Eastern nations, and anxious that our com
mercial interests In those countries may be
preserved, and that the safety of our citl
Eens there shall not be jeopardized, I would
not hesitate to heed any intimation that our
friendly aid for the honorable termination
of hostilities would be acceptable to both
belligerents.
The Bering: Sea Agreement.
Early in the present year an agreement
was reached with Great Britain concerning
lnstiuctlons to be given to the naval com
manders of the two governments In Ber
ing sea and the contiguous North Pacific
ocean for their guidance in the execution
of the award of the Paris tribunal of arbi
tration and the enforcement of the regula
tions therein prescribed, for the protection
of seal life iu the waters mentioned. An
understanding lias also been reached for
the payment by the United States of fti-W
D00 in full satisfaction of all claims which
may be made by Great Britain for damages
growing out of the controversy as to fur
seals in Bering or the seizure of British
vessels engaged in taking seals in these
waters. The awards and findings of the
Paris tribunal to a great extent deter
mined the facts and principles upon which
ttese claims should be adjusted and they
have been submitted by both governments
to thorough examination upon the prnul
ples, as well as the facts which thev in
volved. I am convinced that a settlement
upon the terms mentioned would be an
pquitable and advantageous one, and I
lecommend that provision be made for the
prompt payment of the stated sum. Thus
far only France and Portugal have signified
their willingness to adhere to the regula
tions established under the award of the
Paris tribunal of arbitration. Pieliminary
surveys of the Alaskan boundary and a pre
paratory examination of the question of
protection of food fish in the contiguous
waters of the United States and the Domin
ion of Canada are in progress.
Regarding Hawaii.
Since communicating the voluminous cor
respondence in regard to Hawaii and the
action taken by the senate and house of rep
resentatives on certain questions submitted
to the judgment and wider discretion of
congress, the organization of a government
in place of the provisional arrangement
which followed the deposition of the queen
has been announced with evidence of its
effective operation. The recognition usual
In such cases has been accorded the new
government
The BlnefleldV Inciden t.
Prominent among the questions of the
year was the Bluefieids' incident in what is
known as the Mosquito Indian strip, bor
dering on the Atlantic ocean and within the
Jmiscliction of Nicaragua. By the treaty of
1860 between Great Britain and Nicaragua
the former government expressly recognized
the sovereignty of the latter over the strip
and a limited form of self-government was
guaranteed to the Mosquito Indians, to be
exercised according to their customs, for
themselves and other dwellers within its
limits. The so called native government
which grew to be largely made up of aliens,
for many years disputed the sovereignty of
Nicaragua over the strip and claimed the
right to maintain a practically Independent
government. Early in the past year efforts
of Nicaragua to maintain sovereignty over
the Mosquito terrltiry led to serious dis
turbances culminating in the suppression
of the native government ana the attempted
substitution of an impracticable composite
administration in Nicnragut and alien resi
dents were to participate. Failure was f( 1-
lowed by an insurrection which for a time
subTerted Nicaiaguan rule, expelling her of
ficers and restoiing ihe old organicition.
This in turn gave place to the existing local
government established and upheld Nic
aragua.
For some months on and during part of
the time two of our naval atoips have been
stationed at Bluefieids, for the protection
of all legitimate interests of our citizens.
In September last the government at Man
uaga expelled from its territory twelve or
more foreigners. Including two Americans,
for alleged participation in the sedition or
revolutionary movements against the repub
lic at Bluefieids already mentioned but
through the earnest remonstrance of this
government the two Americans have been
permitted to return to the peaceful manage
ment of their business Our naval com
manders at the scene of these disturbances,
by their constant exhibition of firmness and
good judgment contributed largely to the
prevention of more serious consequences and
to the restoration of peace and order. I e
gret that in the midst of these occurrences
there happened a most grave and irritating
failure of Nicaragua justice. An American
citizen named Wilson residing at Kaamk
Mosquito territory, was murdered by one
Argueleo, the acting governor of the town.
After some delay the murderer was ar
ested, but so insecurely confined or guarded
that he escaped and notwithstanding ou
repeated demands it is claimed that his re
capture has been impossible by teason of
his fight beyond Nicaraguan jurisdiction.
The Nicaraguan authorities having given
notice of forfeiture of their concession to
the canal company on grounds purely tech
nical and not embraced in the contract have
receded from that position.
As to Samo a,
In my last annual message I referred
briefly to the unsatisfactory state of affairs
In Samoa under the operation of tbe Berlin
treaty as signally illustrating the policy of
entangling alliances with foreign powers,
and on May 9th, 1804, in response to a reso
lution of the senate, sent a special message
and documents to that body on the same
subject, which emphasized my previously
expressed opinions. Later occurrences, the
correspondence in regard to which will
be laid before congress, further demonstrate
i1
that the government which was devised by
the three powers and forced upon the Sa
moans against their inveterate hostility can
fi be maintained by continued pres

Ol'TLOOK FINANCIALLY.
A Deficit During the Past Year and
Promises of More of it.
The secretary of the treasury reports the
receipts to this government from all sources
of revenue during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1894, amounted to $3' 2.802.498.2!).
and its expenditures to $442,605,758 87. leav
ing a deficit of $69,803,260.58. There was
a decrease of $15,952,674.66 li the-oi dinary
expenses of the government, as compared
with the fiscal year of 1893.
There was collected from customs $131,-
818.530 62, and from interna' revenue $147.-
168,449 70. The balance of the Income for
the year, amounting to $9S.615.517 97, vras
derived' from' tile sales of lands and other
sources.
The values of our total dutiable Imports
amounted to $275,199,086, being $146,657,625.
less than dueling the preceding year, and the
Importations free of duty amounted to 379,-
795,536, being $64,748,675 less than during
the preceding year. The receipts from cus
toms were $73,530,48811 less and from in.-
ternal revenue $13,836,539.77 less than in
1893.
The total tax collected from distilled spir*
Its was $85,259,250.25 on manufactured
tobacco $8,617,898.62, and on fermented
liquors $31,414,788 04.
Our exports of merchandise, domestic and
foreign, amounted during the year to $892,-
140,572, being an increase over the preceding
year of $44,495,378.
The total amount of gold exported during
the flscial year was $76,998,061, as against
$108,680,444 during the fiscal year 1893.
The amount Imported was $72,449,118, as
against $21,174,381 during the previous year.
The imports of silver were $13,286,552, and
the exports were $50,451,265. The total
bounty paid upon the production, of sugar in
the United States for the fiscal year was
$12,100,208.89, being an increase of $2,725,-
078.01 over the payments made during the
preceding year. The amount of bounty paid
from July 1, 1894, to Aug. 28, 1894, the
time when further payments ceased by op
eration of law was $966,185.84. The total
expenses incurred in the payment of the
bounty upon sugar during the fiscal year was
$130,140.85.
It Is estimated that upon the basis of
our present revenue laws, the receipts of
the government during the fiscal year end
ing June 30. 189b, will be $424,427,748.44,
and its expenditures $444,427,748.44, result
ing In
A Deficit of 920.000,0:)0.
On the 1st day of November, 1894, the
total stock of money of all kinds in the
country was $2,240,773,888, as against
$2,204,051,000 on the 1st day of November,
1893, and the money of all kinds in circula
tion, or not Included in the treasury hold
ings, was $1,672,093,422, or $24.27 per capita,
upon an estimated population of 68,887,000.
At the same date there was held in the
treasury gold bullion amounting to $44,615,-
177.55, and sliver bullion, which was pur
chased at a cost of $127,779,988. The pur
chase of silver bullion under the act ox July
14, 1890, ceased on the 1st day of No em
ber, 1893, and up to that time there had
been purchased during the fiscal year 11,-
917,658.78 fine ounces, at a cost of $8,71o,-
521.32-4in average cost of $0.7313 per fine
ounce. The total amount of silver pur
chased from the time that the law took
effect until the repeal of Its purchasing
clause, on the date last mentioned, was
168,674,682.53 fine ounces, which cost $155,-
931,002 25 the average price per fine ounce
being $0.9244. The total amount of stand
ard silver dollars coined at the mints of the
United States since the passage af tbe act
of Feb. 28, 1878, Is $421,776,408, of which
$378,166,793 were coined under the provis
ions of that act, $38,531,143 under the pro
visions of the act of July 14, 1890, and
$5,078,472 under the act providing for the
coinage of trade dollar bullion.
The total coinage of all metals at our
mints during the last fiscal year consisted
of 63,485,220 pieces, vaued at $106,216.-
730.06, of which t-re were $99,474,912 50
in gold coined $7 iu standard silver dol
lars $6,024,140.30 subsidiary sliver coin,
and $716,919.26 in niuior coin.
THE ARMY.
Some Changes Are Considered Very
Desirable.
From the report of the secretary of war
it appears that the strength of the army
on Sept. 30, 1894, was 2,185 officers and
25,765 enlisted men. Although this is ap
parently a very slight decrease compared
with the previous year, the actual effectiye
force has been increased to the equivalent
of nearly two regiments through the re
organization of the system of recruiting
and the consequent release to regimental
dutv of the large force of men hitherto
serving at the recruiting depots. The abol
ition of these depots, it is predicted, will
furthermore effect an annual reduction ap
proximating $250,000 in the direct expendi
tures, besides promoting generally the
health, morals and discipline of the troops.
Increase Its Strength.
While the maximum legal strength of the
army Is 25,000 men. the effective stength.
for various causes, Is but little over 20,000
men The purpose of "ongress does not
therefore seem to be fully attained by the
existing condition. While no considerable
increase in the army is in my judgment
demanded by recent events, the policy of
sea coast fortification, In the prosecution of
which we have been steadilv engaged for
some years, has so far developed as to sug
gest that the effective strength of the army
be now made at least equal to the legal
strength. Measures taken by the depart
ment during the year as indicated have al
ready considerably augmented the effective
force, and the secretarv of war presents a
plan which I recommend to the consideration
of congress to attain the desired end. Econ
omies effected In the department in other
lines of its work will offset to a great extent
the expenditure involved in the proposition
submitted. Among other things this con
templates the adoption of the three bat
talllon formation of regiments which for
several years hat been indorsed by the sec
retaries of war and the generals commanding
the army. Compact in itself, it provides a
skeleton organization ready to be filled out
in the event of war which is peculiarly
adapted to our strength and requirements
and the fact that "every nation, with a single
exception, has adopted this formation to
meet the condition of modei warfare should
alone secure for the recommendation an
early consideration.
The Recent Strike.
It is hardly neccessary to recall the fact
that in obedience to the commands of the
constitution and the laws and for the pur
pose of protecting the property of the
ITnited States, aiding the process of federal
courts and removing7lawless
obstructions to
the nerformance by the government of its
legitimate functions it became necessary in
various localities during the year to em
ploy a considerable portion 'of the regular
troops. The duty was discharged promptly,
courageously and with marked discretion by
the officers and men and the most gratify
ing proof was thus afforded that the army
deserves that complete confidence in its
efficiency and discipline which the country
has at all times manifested.
OLNEY'S DEPARTMENT.
The Circuit Court of Appeals Proves
a. Success.
The report of the attorney general notes
Ihe gratifying progress made by the su
preme court in overcoming the arrears of
its business and in reaching a condition in
which it will be able to dispose of cases
as they arise without any unreasonable
delay. This result Is, of course, very largely
due to the successful working of the plan
inaugurating circuit courts of appeals In
respect to these tribunals the suggestion
is made, in quarters entitled to the highest
consideration, that an additional circuit
judge for each circuit would greatly
strengthen these courts and the confidence
reposed in their adjudications, and that such
an addition would not create a greater
force of judges than the increasing business
of such courts requires. I commend the
suggestion to the careful consideration of
congress. Other important topics are ad
verted to in the report accompanied by
recommendations, many of which have been
treated at large in previous messages and
at this time therefore need only be named.
I refer to the abolition of the fee sys
tem as a measure of compensation to federal
officers the enlargement of the powers of
United States commissioners at least in
the territories, tbe allowance of writs of
eiror in criminal cases on behalf of the
United States and the establishing of de
grees in the crime of murder. A topic dealt
with by the attorney general of much im
portance Is the condition of the administra-.
tlon of justice in the Indian territory. The
permanent solution of what is called the
Indian problem is probably not to be ex
pected at once, but meanwhile such amelior
ations of present conditions as the system
will admit of, ought not to be neglected.
I am satisfied there should be a federal
court established for the territory, with suf
ficient judges, and that this court should
sit within the territory and should have
jurisdiction as to territorial affairs as now
vested In the federal courts sitting in Ar
kansas and Texas.
POSTOFFICE AFFAIRS
A Change in Second-Class Rates Is
Recommended.
The report of the postmaster general pre
sents a comprehensive statement of the
operations of the postoflice department for
the last fiscal year. The receipts of the
department during the year amounted to
$75,080,479.04 and the expenditures $84,324,-
414.15.
The transactions of the postal service In
dicate with barometric certainty the fluctua
tions In the business of tbe country. Inas
much, therefore, as business complications
continue- to exist throughout the last year
to the unfocseen extent, it is not surprising
that the deficiency of revenue to meet the
expenditures of the postaffice department,
which was estimated in advance at about
eight million dollars, should be exceeded by
nearly one and one ouarter million dollars.
The ascertained revenues of the last year,
which were the basis of calculation for the
current year, being less that estimated, the
deficiency for the current year will be cor
respondingly greater, though the postmaster
general states that the latest Indications
are so favorable that be confidently pre
dicts an increase of at least 8 per cent in
the revenues of the current year over those
of the last year. The expenditures increase
steadily and necessarily with the growth and
needs of the country, so that the deficiency
is greater or less in any year defending upon
the volume of receipts.
The postmaster general renews the sug
gestion made in a previous report that the
department organization be increased to the
evtent of creating a direct district super
vision of all postal affairs, and in this
suggestion I fully concur.
There are now connected with the post
office establishment 32,661 employes who
are in the classified service. This includes
many who have been classified upon the
suggestion of the postmaster-genera!, xie
states that another year's experience at the
head of the department serves only to
strengthen the conviction as to the excellent
working of the civil service law in this
branch of the public service.
THE NEW NAVY.
A Gratifying Progress In the Con
struction of Ships.
Attention is called to the report of the
secretary of the navy, which shows very
gratifying progress in the construction of
ships for our new navy. All the vessels now
building, Including the three tor-pedo boats
authorized at the last session of congress
aaid excepting the first-class battle-ship
Iowa, will probably be completed during
the coming bscal year.
The estimates for the increase of the navy
for the year ending June 30, 1896, are large,
but they include practically the entire sum
necessary to complete and equip all new
ships not now in commission, so that un
less new ships are authorized the appro
priations for the navy service for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, should
fall below tbe estimates for the coming
year Dy at least $12,000,000.
More Shi ps Needed.
The secretary presents with much earnest
ness a plea for the authorization of three
additional battle-ships and ten or twelve
topedo boats. While the unarmed vessels
heretofore authorized, including those now
neanng completion, will constitute a fleet
which it is believed is sufficient for ordinarv
cruising purposes in time of peace, we have
now completed and In process of construc
tion but four first-class battle-ships and but
few torpedo boats. If we are to have a
navy for warlike operations, offensive and
defensive, we certainly ought to increase
both the number of battle-ships and tor
pedo boats.
HOKE SMITH'S WORK.
Recommendations Regarding Pnblic
Lands, Pensions and Patents.
The report of the secretary of the in
terior exhibits the situation of the numer
ous and interesting branches of the public
service connected with his department. I
commend this report and the valuable rec
ommendations of the secretary to the care
ful attention of the congress.
The public land disposed of during the
year amounts to 10,406,100.77 acres, includ
ing 28,876,05 of Indian lands. It Is estimat
ed that the public domain still remaining
amounts to a little more than 600,000,000
acres excluding, however, about 360,000,000
acres in Alaska as well as military reserva
tions and railroad and other selections of
lands yet unadjudlcated.
The Indian Problem,
Though the condition of the Indians shows
a steady and healthy progress, their situa
tion is not satisfactory at all points Some
of them to whom allotments of land have
been made are found to be unable or dis
inclined to follow agricultural pursuits or
otherwise beneficially manage their land.
xx*.s Is especially true of the Cheyennes and
Arapahoes, who, as it appears by reports
of their agents, have in many instances
never been located upon their allotments,
and in some cases do not even know where
their allotments are. Their condition has
deteriorated. They are not self-supporting
and they live in camps ana spend their times
In idleness.
Pensions.
At the close of the last fiscal year, on the
30th day of June, 1894, there were 969,544
persons on our pension rolls, being a net
increase of 3,532 over the number reported
at the end of the previous year. These pen
sioners may be classed as follows: Soldiers
and sailor, survivors of all wars, 753.96S
widows and relatives of deceased soldiers,
115,162 army nurses in the war of the re
bellion. 414 Of these pensioners, 32 039 are
surviving soldiers of Indian and other wars
prior to the late civil war. and the widows
and relatives of such soldiers.
The remainder, numbering 937,503, are re
ceiving pensions on account of the war of
the rebellion and of them 469,344 are now
under the authority of the act of June 27,
1890, sometimes called the dependent pen
sion law. The total amount expended for
pensions during the year was $139,804,461 05,
leaving an unexpended balance from the
sum appropriated of $25,205,712 65. The
sum necessary to meet pension exoenditures
for the year ending June 30, 1896, is esti
mated at $140,000,000.
INTERESTING TO FARMERS.
Comments Up on Secretary Morton's
Annual Report.
The secretary of agriculture in his report
reviews the operations of Ms department
for the last fiscal year, and makes recom
mendations for the further extensions of its
usefulness. He reports a saving in expendi
tures during the year of $600,000, which is
covered back into the treasury. This sum
is 23 per cent of the entire appropriation.
A special study has been made of the de
mand for American farm products in all
foreign markets, especially Great Britain
That country received from the United
States during the nine months ending Sept.
30, 11894, 305,910 live beef cattle, valued at
$26,500,000, as against 1S2.611 cattle valued
at $16,632,000 during the same period for
1893. During the first six months of 1894
the United Kingdom took 112,000,000 pounds
of dressed beef from the United States,
valued at nearly $10,000,000.
The report shows that during the nine
months immediately preceding Sept. 30,
1894, the United States exported to Great
Britain 22,676.000 pounds of pork of apples
1,900,000, valued at $2,500,000. and of
horses 2,811, at an average of $139 per head.
There was a falling off In American wheat
exports of 13,500,000 bushels, and the sec
retary is inclined to believe that wheat may
not, in the future, be the staple export
cereal product of our country, but that corn
will continue to advance in importance as
an export on account of the uses to which
It is constantly being appropriated.
The export of agricultural products from
the United States during the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1894, amounted to $628,363,038,
being 72.28 per cent of American exports of
every description, and the United Kingdom
of Great Britain took more than 54 per
cent*of all farm products finding foreign
markets.
CIVIL SERVICE.
Tii* P,,i,int pieaaed with th Ke. 3i
The rresiaent neasea with the Ke- 1
formPnblic Health and Labor.
The advantage to the public service of
an adherence to the principles of civil serv
ice reform are constantly more apparent
and nothing is so encouraging to those in
official life who honestly desire good gov
ernment as the increasing appreciation by
our people of these advantages. A vast
majority of the voters of the land are ready
to insist that the time and attention of
those they select to perform for them the
more important public duties should not
be distracted by dealing out minor offices,
and they are growing to be unanimous
In regarding party organization.as something
that shonld be used In establishing party
principles instead of dictating the distribu
tion of public places as rewards of parti
san activity.
Numerous additional offices and places
have lately been brought within civil service
rules and regulations, and some others will
probably soon be included. Tne report of
the commissioners will be submitted to
the congress and I invite careful attention
to the recommendations it contains. ^^^HpSt
The Labor Commission.
&*',.f!
i
By virtue of a statute of the United States
passed In 1888, I apnointed in July last
Hon. John D. Kenwm, of the State of New
York, and Hon. Nicholas E. Worrhington,
of the State of Illinois, to form with Hon.
Carroll D. Wright, commissioner of labor,
who was designated by said statute, a com
mission for the purpose of making careful
inquiry into the causes of the controversies
between certain railroads and their employes
which have resulted in an extensive and
destructive strike, accompanied by much
violence and dangerous disturbance with
considerable loss of life and great destruc
tion of property.
The report of the commissioners has been
submitted to me and will be transmitted to
congress with the evidence taken upon
their investigation. Their work has been
well done and their standing and intelligence
give assurance that the report and sugges
tions they make are worthy of careful coik
sideration.
THE TARIFF.
The President Conside rs the Matter
Not Yet Settled.
The tariff act passed at the last session of
the congress needs important amendments
if it is to be executed effectively and with
certainty. In addition to such necessary
amendments as will change rates of duty,
I am still very decidedly in favor of put
ting coal and iron upon the free list}
So far as the sugar schedule is concerned,
I would be glad under existing aggravations
to see every particle of differential duty in
favor of refined sugar stricken out of our
tariff law. If with all the favor now ac
corded the sugar refining interest in our
tariff laws it still languishes to the ex
tent of closing refineries and discharging
thousands of workmen it would seem to
present a hopeless case for reasonable leg
islative aid.
Whatever else is done or omitted I earnest
ly repeat the recommendation made in an
other portion of this communication that
the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent
per pound laid upon sugar imported from
countries paying a bounty on its export be
.abrogated. It seems to me that exceedingly
important considerations point to the pro
pritty of this amendmeat
MORE BONDS.
The President Says They Will
Issued as Often as Necessary.
During the last month the gold reserved
in the treasury for the purpose of redeem
ing the notes of the government circulating
nOw in the hands of the people became so
reduced, and its further depletion in the
near future seemed so certain that in the
exercise of proper care for the pub'Ic wel
fare it became" necessary to replenish the
reserve and thus maintain popular faith in
the ability and determination of the gov
ernment to meet, as agreed, its pecuniary
obligations.
It would have been well if in this emer
sency authority had existed to issue the
bonds of the government bearing a low rate
of interest and maturing within a short
peiiod, but congress having railed to
confer such authority resort was necessarily
Uad to the resumption act of 1875, and pur
suant to its provisions bonds were issued
drawing interest at the rate of 5 per cent
per annum and maturing ten years after
their issue, that being the shortest time au
thorized by the act. I am glad to say. how
ever, that on the sale of these bonds the
premium received operated to reduce the
rate of interest to be paid by the govern,
tment to less than 3 per cent.
NEW CURRENCY SCHEME,
A Plan Suggested by Secretary Car
lisle Is Endorsed.
Questions relating to our banks and cui
rency are closely connected with the sub
ject just referred to and they also present
some unsatisfactory features. Prominent
among them are the lack of elasticity in our
currency circulation and its frequent con
centration in financial centers when it is
most needed in other parts of the country.
The absolute divorcement of the govern
ment from the business of banking is the
ideal relationship of the government to the
circulation of the currency of the couutry.
This condition cannot be immediately
reached, but as a step in that direction and
as a means of seeming a mocs elastic cur
rency and obviating other objections to the
present arrangement of bank circulation, the
secretary of the treasury presents in his re
port a scheme modifying present bank laws
and providing for the issue of circulating
notes by state banks free from taxation un
der certain limitations.
It Is proposed to repeal all laws providing
for the deposit of United States bonds as
security for circulation to permit national
banks to issue circulating notes not exceed
ing in amount 75 per cent of their paid up
and unimpaired capital, provided they de
posit with the government as a guaiantee
fund in the United States legal tendr notes,
including treasury notes of 1890 a sum equal
in amount to 30 per cent of the notes they
desire to issue, this deposit to be main
tained at all times, but wnenever any bank
retires any part of its cii dilation a propor
tionate part of its guarantee fund shall be
returned to it to permit the secretary of
the treasury to prepare and keep on hand
ready for issue in case an increase in cir
culation is desired blank national bank
notes for each bank having circulation and
to repeal the provisions of the present law
Imposing limitations and restrictions upon
banks desiring to reduce or increase their
circulationthus permitting such increase
or reduction within the limit of 75 per cent
of capital to be quickly made as emergencies
In addition to the guarantee fund re
quired, it is proposed to provide a safety
fund for the immediate redemption of the
circulating notes of failed banks by impos
ing a small annual tax, say one-half of
1 per cent, upon the average circulation of
each bank until the fund amounts to 5
per cent of the total circulation outstanding.
When a bank fails its guarantee fund is
to be paid into this safety fund and its
notes are to be redeemed in the first in
stance from such safety fund thus aug
mentedany impairment of such fund
caused thereby to be made good from the
immediately available cash assets of said
bank, and if these should be insufficient
such impairment to be made good by pro
rata assessments among the other banks,
their contributions consisting a first lien
upon the assets of failed bank in favor
of the contributing banks.
A a Farther Secnrity.
As a further security it is contemplated
that the existing provision fixing the indiv
idual liability of stockholders is to be re
tained and the banks' indebtedness on ac
count of its circulating notes is to lie made
a first lien OH all its assets.
For the purpose of meeting the expense of
printing notes, official supervision, cancela
tion and other like eharges there shall be
paid a tax say, one-half of 1 per cent per
annum on the average amount of notes in
circulation. It is further provided that there
shall be no national bank notes issued of
less denomination than ten dollars- that each
national bank, except in case of a failed
bank, shall redeem or letire its notes in
the first instance at its own office or at
agencies to be designated by it and that no
fixed reserve need be maintained on account
of deposits.
Another very important feature of this
plan is the exemption of state banks from
taxation by the United States In eases
where it Is shown to the satisfaction of the
secretary of the treasury and the controller
of the currency by banks claiming suHi
exemption that they have not had outstand
ing their circulating notes exceeding 75 per
cent of their paiS-up and unimpaired cap
ital that their stockholders are Individually
liable tor the redemption of their circu
lating notes to the full extent of tbeir
ownerships
of
stock:r
stitute
that the
hank upon thei circulatingliabilitycoof notes

upon theinrdeassets:r that such banks have
kept and maintained a guarantee fund in
United States legal tender notes, including
treasury notes of 1890, equal to 30 per cent
of their outstanding circulating notes, and
that such banks have promptly redeemed
their circulating notes when presented at
their principal or branch offices. It is quite
likelv that this scheme may be usefully
amended in some of Its details: but I am
satisfied it furnishes a basis for a very
great improvement in our present banking
and currency system.

CARBIED OFF HOUSES
THIEVING RUSSIANS OPERATE AT
They Visit the Fort In a Body and
Tear Down and Carry Off Near ly
All the Buildings Some of the
Thieves Are Arrested.
Grand Forks, N. D., Dec. 5 9 he
United States grand jury was dis
charged last night by Judge Thomas,
after bringing in fifty-seven indict
ments. Among the late indictments
is one against T. C. Kennelly of Bis
marck, who is one of the gang -who
is charged with having held up the
deputy marshals at Mandan during
the strike.
A large number of th indictments
are against Russian farmers from iiin
mons county for stealing and carrying
off government buildings at Fort Lin
coin, five miles south of Mandan. The
depredations, according to Maj. W. C.
Gooding, the government representa
tive at the fort, have been going on
for some time. Russian settlers in
that vicinity have been engaged in
thieving lumber and outbuildings for
some time, making their visits mostly
during the night, and all efforts to
catch them have failed. During the
past few weeks, however, they have
grown bolder, and on Saturday a small
army, numbering over 100, put in an
appearance, with forty-five teams,
pickaxes and all necessary appliances,
ready to clean every inch of lumber
from the spot. Maj. Gooding, who has
charge of tbe fort, protested, but the
hoodlums drove him away with bricks
and stones and continued to demolish
the buildings. Even the old Ouster
house, which the people of the slope
have endeavored to preserve, was not
spared, but ruthlessly torn to pieces.
Deputy United States Marshal Hen
nessy of this city and Deputy Hannah
of Grafton were at Bismarck and
made a raid on the thieves Saturday.
Pickets posted by the thieves gave
notice of their coming, and the entire
party made an effort to escape, but
the deputies succeeded in rounding up
eight of them and secured the names
of forty others. Five were left in jail
at Bismarck and three brought here
as witnesses before the grand jury.
Of 117 buildings at the fort very few
remain, the destruction being almost
complete.

the boys tried to square himself by
saying that he merely told the boy to

AT THE WHITE HOUSE
Tlie President Loolcs Well, but Has
a Pronounced Limn.
Washington, Dec. 0. Pres dent
Cleveland came to the White House
at 30 o'clock. It was the first visit he
had made to, the city for two weeks
past. He came alone and was met by
Mr. Thurber when he entered. he
president looked well, considering the
severe illness he has suffered from,
and the only outward sign of his ail
ment was the pronounced limp which
characterized his walk from the car
riage into the horse. Probably be
cause his coming had been generally
not expected there were very few call
ers at the White House in the morn
ing, the only one of note being Repre
sentative Catchings of Mississippi,
who, on behalf of the speaker, came to
inquire whether the president would
receive the committee of notification
at the White House.
WOT VOLCANIC.
The Changes on Mount Ranier Are
Due to Avalanches.
Seattle, Wash., Dec. 5.The ai* was
sufficiently clear yesterday to permit
of Mount* Ranier being plainly seen,
and there now remains no doubt but
the mountain has undergone many
changes, but it is due to a series of
tremendous avalanches of snow, ice
and earth, not an unusual a-aptioa.
To-day it was observed that the crater
rim was intact, showing that no
trouble occurred there, but below,
great slices of the mountain have dis
appeared and a bluff of solid matter
several hundred feet high and of un
known length has appeared. It is sup
posed that other slides have occurred
on the other si^e of the mountain also.
