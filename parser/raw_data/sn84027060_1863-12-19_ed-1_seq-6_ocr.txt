A great REVOLUTION is at work among ns.—
Vew recognise the FACT. None of us fully com
mfeendtu Whatever the event, it 1B plain that
W attempt to rend the Union asunder has
«rokfid the beet and noblest attributes of man
kood amopg us, and made "ministering angels"
Of the women of the land. The storm of war
which boost npon UB would have destroyed a
«orrapt and effeminate people. It has merely
•wakened us from our sleep of fancied quiet and
•eoority—'warned as of the peril and armed as
tafUte straggle. The baptism of blood, the
Buf­
ferings, the fierce buffelings of the enormous
«onfifci, have stirred the souls of the people, and
animated them with the zeal and courage of
—limit and unflinching patriotism.. We no
longer refer to
antiquity, nor even to our strug
gle lor National Independence, for examples of
neroio daring and unfaltering devotion. They
are all around uS. We look at the million of
men who rallied round the Flag in the begin
ning, at all who have fonght under it since, at
those who have died in its defence, at the un
complaining mothers and wives of the absent
vt
the dead, tolling and struggling for the sup
port of the children of these patriots, see how
efceerfully these sufferings- ana sacrifices were
made ana are endured, and we think better of
humanity—we grow proud of our oountrymen.
This war, which has thus exalted American
manbood and womanhood, is a war of ideas—a
conflict between antagonistic social organiza-
Those who wield the sword and those
who minister to the sick and wounded soldiers,
are not the only workers in the cause. The
greater battle is to be contested at home. It is
HEKE, that the great question of the future is ul
timately to be determined. Here, if anywhere,
the barbarism of Slavery is to receive its con
demnation. Here, if anywhere, the impossibili
ty of Secession, of National Suicide, is to be
demonstrated.
This battle against the insidious assaults of
Ignorance, Prejudice, Falsehood, Hatred and
Malice, is to be contested in the Forum and
through the Press—chiefly by the latter. The
Press—thanks to cheap printing—has become
the main lever in moving, organizing, consoli
dating, public opinion. It not only informs and
educates it unites and makes effective the pop
ular will. For the most part it is healthy In
totie, moral in sentiment, honorable in purpose.
Hence, where papers are readjhpublic opinion is
heartily loyal, and popular action is sure to be
theresnttof inteHigent-ijudgment and nonara
bl© motives. In families, in neighborhoods, in
Towns, Counties and States, this s a well estab
lished FACT, noted and accepted by all observ
ers', bnt "valned and esteemed the most by the
wisest and best of our citizens. Four-fifths of
those who derive their knowledge of passing
events, public men and public affairs, from the
Press, vote right. Almost every man who has
regularly drawn from the Press his knowledge
of the war, from the beginning,—who by its as
sistance has traced out every act from its cause
to its result, is now on the side of his country,
earnestly supports the war and the Government,
and votes for those who do likewise, whatever
may have befcn his former political associations.
It is only among those who do not thus keep
ftmiliar with the great events of the times that.
Hie enemies of the country havc'influence.
Important as have been tho events of the last
three years, still more important are those
whioh will transpire during the year to come.
We hope and expect to see ine end of the Rebel
lion before the close of 1804. Ere then, we ex
pect to see the States re-united under the,old'
Flag. In this we may be mistaken. But we are
not mistaken in saying that an election for Pre
sident occurs next' year—that once more the
"irrepressible" conflict of ideas is to intensify a
Presidential contest before the people. Untiring
energy aud sleeplessjvigilance are the price wo
must pay for success. NOW is the best time to
labor. And the best labor that can bedone is to
make sure that a reliable, earnest, vigorous and
loyal newspaper goes into everyfamily. Those
who are unable, or who may not be disposed, to
take one themselves, should be supplied at the
expense of their neighbors.
As an humble, butdiligentand earnest worker,
THE HAWK-EYE
calls Upon its readers and the true friends of the
Union, to still further enlarge Its field of useful
ness, Curing the coming year. What has been
done in the present year is a cheering proof of
what may be done in the future.
The efforts of our friends and the liberal pat
ranageof the people, have made the WFEKI..Y
HAWK-EYE a success, notwithstanding its
jnammoth proportions and low price. It has
Jajrly competed with the Journals of Eastern
cities—AND PAID. We candidly own that we
execution, is printed in the whole Northwest.
What its influence has been, it is not for us, but
fbr the Public, to say.

'The President must bfe gratified at
the. general satisfaction his plan for the
practical re-organization of the rebellious
States feivetf to all classes of men and to alh
varieties of opinion. This satisfaction, we
take it, results principally from the fact
that, while it waives useless discussions as
to the actual political or social status of the
South, it smooths the way for those who
are disposed to repent of their errors or
their crimes, to restore themselves to the
protection of the law.. Whether the best or
the wisest,mode in the abstract, it is prac
tical, attains the end, and avoids debate
•bout questions upon which it is scarcely
possible all classes would agree. As all
inen who desire to maintain the Union,
ardently concur in the purpose of the Pro
clamation, $o they are willing to co-operate
in almost any mode of action calculated to
secure it without compromising the dignity
and honor and'safety of the Nation. Mr.
Lincoln has probably hit upon a happy
medium betweea the two extremes of loy
al opinion, and without combatting either,
—without'assuming that either is wrong,
or unpolitic, or insufficient, bridges over
the disagreement, and invites, not assent
or indorsement, but co-operation. Men
will do who will not otherwise sanc
tion the scheme. They will' aid any plan
which promises success, so they are not
required to give up opinions they cherish
and believe just. It may not be the rohd
they deem best. But it is a road. It leads
to the desired point. By traveling on it,
we shall reach our desired end. They
think it better to go by almost any road
than to waste time in determining the com
parative merits of all. That is the source
of the general acquiescence. Perhaps this
ia the very highest merit any plan could
possibly have. .y
The real cause of the refusal of the
rebels to receive any further supplies for
the use of the Union prisoners, as hinted in
our dispatches yesterday, is the highest ev
idenoe we cauld have of the desperate con
dition to which they are reduced. Think
of the fact. The supplies forwarded, insuf
ficient as we have all deemed them, put the
prisoners in a better condition than that of
any family in Richmond and the people
of that place, abandoned of all feeling of
honor or humanity, and unable to give the
prisoners the necessaries of life, will not
permit us to supply them! Recollect, too,
that we have forwarded nothing superflu
ous, nothing unnecessary, nothing but such
articles of food, clothing and medicines, as
we constantly supply our own troops in
the field and our own sick in the hospitals.
If anything more has been sent, they have
been exceptional instances, and did not
affect the nature of the mass. The whole
of the contributions forwarded by the Gov
ernment and by individuals, may be class
ed as absolute essentials to life and comfort.
Yet these excite the jealousy of the traitors,
and, because they cannot supply them for
their own troops and their own families,
they deny them to their prisoners!
This is the result of mere malice. It is
the last manifestation of despair. It prove
plainly, that the "Confederacy" is reduced
to the last extremity and now only studies
how it may manifest its vindietiveness re
gardless alike of decency and humanity.—
They all know that the rebel prisoners we
hold, largely in excess of ours in their
hands, are liberally supplied with food, and
comfortably clothed and quartered. They
have no apology for their conduct. If they
cannot supply their prisoners with similar
supplies, there is nothing to excuse this
last atrocity of denying us the privilege of
doing it. It only manifests that fotal de
pravity and demoniac rage which delights
in cruelty and perfidy for its own sake.
^sff'The following is an extract from tife
Richmond Kzaminer of the 11th inst.
fnrnishes us with rebel evidence as to
manner in which the Uniort prisoners
treated by their own authorities,
needed no testimony of the sort, for unfor
tunately the amount already furnished by
tiose who have suffered in their hands ad
mits of no dispute. But Foote is a rebel
.Senator, and has, in his place, given Jeff.
Davis' Message the lie. He tells enoUgh.to
show that there is cruelty and attempted
starvation. But it is not likely that he
,either wished or dared to announce the
whole truth
RICHMOND, Friday, Dec. 11, 1803.—Yes
terday the Senate passed the bill prohibit
ing the employment of substitutes in the
army.
In the rebel Congress on the bth inst., Mr.
Foote, of Tennessee, in a speech, said that
the President never visited the army with
out doing it injury. Never has he visited
any of our armies but what it has been fol
lowed by disaster. He charged him with
almost having ruined the country, and he
would meet his champion anywhere to dis
cuss it.
ir- accused Commissary Northrup with
having starved the enemy's prisoners, and
with stealthily placing^ the Confederate
Government in the attitude
charged by the
enemy. From the 1st to the 26th of No
vember, meat was furnished to the prison
ers very irregularly. For twelve days the
supply was inadequate, and for eight days
they got none at all. He demanded the
removal ot Mr. Northrup, for the honor of
the country.
J®* That demon in human shape who
wields the power over Dixie, Jeff. Davis,
in his late "Message" has the hardihood to
accuse the Government of cruelty to pris
oners He offers no proof and mentions
no instance, for the good reason that he
has none to present. He knows, as we all
know, that rebel prisoners are treated well
among us—are well supplied with food,
supplied with sufficient clothing, furnished
with excellent quarters, and are nowhere
subjected to any other restraint than such
as is essential to retain them in safe custo
dy. But the truth does not suit his purpo
ses. Accordingly he lies persistently, by
wholesale, as he has been doing all his life.
What better could be "expected of the per
jured traitor? But the people of Dixie
know he lies as well as we do. They can't
help seeing hisrfalsehoods, because they
are daily feeling their terrible consequen
ces. They understand him pretty well by
this time, and many are waiting for the
glad hour when they can avenge them
selves upon him.
THE SOLDIERS' VOTE.—AS a matter
which will probably interest a great many
of our readers, we print the opinion of the
Supreme Court upon the question of the
validity of the law authorizing "the soldiers
in the army to vote. The opinion is by
Judge Wright, and speaks for itself. It
affirms the validity of the law as it ought,
and so far, at least, will prove satisfactory
to all who do not wish to disfranchise those
who are proving their worth as citizens by
their gallantry in the field as soldiers of the
Union. It settles the question, we guess,
so that even the Copperhead Supervisors of
Appanoose county will not ventufe to set
up their opinions against it 1
ja*"- Erastus Corning, and his fellows,
have again secured the Directory of the
New York Central Railroad in their own
hands. At the election, the other day, out
of a vote representing twenty millions of
stock, about twelve millions voted in their
favor to about seven for the opposition tick
et. It seems that the Corning wing held
the proxies of pretty much all the stock
held abroad, and had also for some time
been buying all they could to make them
strong. Corning and his friends don't
mefin to be exposed. They have won this
time. The old fellow ought to be satisfied
we should think, with what he has already
made. But, like other men of his stamp,
his desires for money are quite insatiable.
,^V*Oarret Davis, Senator from Kentuc
ky, made a speech of several hours dura
tion, a day or two since. Reverdy John-Nfith the general tone of the President's
sou, of Maryland, replied to him, and gave' 'Message. No doubt all ttie world will be
the elderly gentleman a settler, That was
right. Maryland should reply to Kentuc
ky, and Johnson is quite competent to do
it, if anybody is.
Iowa has a Fourth Battery now. It
was mustered into the service on Nov. 23d,

3pode, ofGlenwood, Mill* County. It is
tfLLU at Davenport, but fully equipped and
will probably ROOD go into the field.
JB®-We see it stated that the National
Jtftelligencer, is really favorably impressed
gratified to learn that it has, at last a "fa
vorable impression," and will indulge in
heartfelt thanks accordingly 1 The Presi
dent, himself, must assuredly leel proud of
bis achievements!
One hundred and seventy-three new
recruits and seventy-one convalescents
were sent South from Camp McClellan,
Davenport, on Tuesday last. That is a
tftart to* ards our State quota!
pm- The'Chicago Tribune lately publish
ed an insinuation that Mr. Bonner, of the
New York Ledger, made a return to the
New York Assessor, to the effect that he
had "no income." At this, Bonaer is in
dignant, styles it an "extraordinary false
hood," and informs the Tribune that if it
will inquire of G. P. Putnam, Esq., Asses
sor for his District, it will ascertain two
facts,—that ho was one of the first to pay
his tax, and that the sum paid was much
larger than that paid by the publisher of
any other weekly paper in the United
States! We suppose the Tribune is satisfi
ed that it "waked up the wrong passenger"
that time.
Miss Dickinson lectured at Spring
field, Mass., on last Friday evening. Des
pite a prevailing snow storm, twenty-five
hundred people assembled to bear her,
and,
the Republican says, were delighted 'with
her eloquent discourse. The large number
present of course, ensured a heavy addi
tion to the Sanitary Aid Society, lor the
benefit of which she was present.
The exports from England for 1863,
up to November 1st, are stated to have
been of the value of ,€193,770,000. For the
same period in 1862, they only amounted to
£103,589,000. Our war don't seem to be so
excessively hard on the "Neutrals" as they
would have us believe.
De Witt, Clinton county, on
Thanksgiving Day, one hundred cords of

A good work. Let others do likewise.
Case or Gen. Samnel A. Rice.
THE EDITOR OF THE HAWK-EVE.—
have noticed in some of tho IoWa
papers {whether in yours I do not remem
ber) a paragraph stating that Gen. Samuel
A. Rice, of our State, has resigned his
commission as Brigadier, upon learning
that the Hon. J. II. Grinnell, M. C. for the
Fourth District has publicly stated that
Col. Elliott W. Rice, brother to Samuel,
was the person intended to be made the
Brigadier. Upon hearing this, Gen. lice,
as a seusitive gentleman and a man of hon
or would, sent in his resignation. The facts
in the case are briefly these:
Some time last summer, Mr. Grinnell
made a visit to this city, upon business of
a public nature, and, among other good
things made a strong effort toward having
Col. Elliott W. Rice, of the Iowa Seventh,
promoted to the rank of Brigadier. There
were obstacles in the way, not however,
owing to any fault of Col. E. W. Rice,
whom your intelligent readers il know to
be a gallant soldier, well worthy the rank
which was asked for him. The chief diffl
eulty, I may say, was in the fact that
Col. Kice had won nis laurels in the cam
paigns of 1862, and Gen. Grant had about
as much as he could do in attending to pro
motions earned during the more recent and
brilliant campaign of Vicksbnrg. It is
within my knowledge that the War De
partment determined, just before Mr.
Grinnell's visit, to make no promotions in
Gen. Grant's department, except where
the parties should be recommended by
Gen. Grant himself. Mr. Grinnell then
fell back upon the President, and closely
besieging him one day, on the southern
balcony of the White House, he at length
got of him this order in pencil: "Let Col.
Elliott W. Rice, of the 7th Iowa, be made
a Brigadier General. A.Lincoln." Upon
this, Mr. Grinnell thought he bad a sure
thing of it—as he would not have thought,
had he been more experienced in such mat
ters. It was, perhaps, not unnatural for
him to suppose, upon learning not long
afterwards that Col. Samuel A. Rice, of the
33d Iowa, had been made a Brigadier, that
a mistake had been committed. He blun
dered, however, in giving expression to
his supposition, without having first
inquired into the facts. The consequence
of that blunder may be the loss of one of
our best Iowa Generals, and the placing of
Col. E. W. Rice in an awkwaru and deli
cate position. I hold Mr. Grinnell in very
high esteem, but I cannot but deeply re
gret the looseness of his tongue in this
matter.
The promotion of Col. Sam. Rice was,
most emphatically, not a mistake, in any
sense whatever. He did not have a par
ticle of political influence at work for him
here, because he did not desire it but he
bad that which was far more powerful with
the War Department—the earnest recom
mendations of his superior officers, inclu
ding Gen. Grant himself. He was regular
ly promoted for meritorious and gallant
conduct at Helena, where every regiment
in the Brigade of which he there had com
mand, suffered more than any other single
brigade in the engagement. Itwasagreed,
in fact, by
"all the officers, that his men did
pretty much all the fighting. He had per
formed first-rate service before—he has
performed first-rate service since. The
War Department declares most perempto
rily that his promotion was well earned by
him,and deliberately conferred by the pow
ers that be. The only mistake that has
been made about the matter at all, was
made through the haste of the honorable
member from the Fourth District.
Your own correspondents give yoU the
gossip from here about general matters. I
will only add, that Senator Grimes and
others of the Iowa delegation in Congress,
called upon Gen. Halleck yesterday, to
hurry up certain promotions of deserving
Iowa Colonels, and that the Senator made
good use of "the energetic idiom," in re
sponse to the remark of the General-in
Chief that there were not places vacant.—
"By the Eternal, we'll make places, then!"
That is the idea in the Jacksonian idiom,

AN IOWAN.
WASHINGTON CITY, Dec. 12,1863.
RECONSTRUCTION—THE PITH OF THE
PRESIDENT'S VIBW.—There has been ten
times more talk about the theory of recon
struction than there is any need of. The
real difficulty has been in oarrying any
theory into practice. First, we have to de
stroy the rebel armies, so that any loyal
government can exist in the rebel States.
Next, we must confine the exercise of the
powers of the State Governments strictly
to the honestly loyal people. Who are they?
Herein ic the pith of the whole matter, and
in the answer to that question is the pith
of the President's Message. But, before we
refer to that, let us examine the premises
in which the President's conclusions are
founded. The Constitution of the United
States, as we have often said, acts on imfi
dividitals only. Its strength lies in the fact,
that when any man, or number of men,
resist the authority of theNational Govern
ment, that authority strikes down upon the
rebels in spite of any State laws. Lunatic
as the States Rights party of the South has
been, it has not oeen able to deny that, ex
cept by claiming that Secession is constitu
tional. H9uce it is that, in the rebellion,
according to the whole practical theory of
the Constitution, it|was individuals rebel
led. Ii the State oould not secede, ranch
less could its loVal inhabitants be in rebel
lion, because its rebel inhabitant# acted
under State laws. Hence, the sin of the
Staie being done by individuals, its salva
tion mnst come in the same way. The idea
that the rebel States are foreign States is
nonsense. The idea that s hundred thou
sand loyal people in Tennessee have no
right to resuscitate their State Government,
because the majority have gone into rebel
lion, is an idea of gross injustice. We are
not at wor with foreign States. If we were,
we ought to make peace immediately, for
we have no wish to make foreign con
quests. 11 is precisely because tbey are not
foreign States, that we are fighting them.
We are fighting to conquer rebels in arms
against their legitimate Government. This
is just, and so recognized by intelligent
men in all ages of the world. In the only
cases where legitimate Government is over
thrown successfully, it is historically and
rightly attributed to force alone. The only
claim ol' the Poles to the sympathies of
mankind is that their own Government
was overthrown by force. The rebels in
their association to effect the overthrow of
our National Government are rebels only.
They are not States in fact, and cannot pos
sibly be so till successful. There is no one
of the rebel States in which there are not
many loval inhabitants. The legitimate
rights of the StateGovernmenthence follow
upon them. This is the doctrine of Mr.
Chase in Mozart Hall, and the doctrine
which Mr. Lincoln has taken as the initial
point of his doctrine of reconstruction.—
Now in this principle here is, by no means,
as much diflrculty as in the practical appli
cation of it. and it is in the application only
tliat politician?, statesmen, and various
sets begin to differ. For it is plain that the
practical results will depend upon who are
construed to be loyal peopleTwo differ
ent constructions may be put upon that
question. If the rebel arms are subdued,
and South Carolina finds she cannot help
herself any longer, the great body of her
people, although steeped in rebellion, may
be perfectly willing to submit to the laws
and Constitution of the United States.—
Suppose that is all, and taking their word
for being Union people, they do, what Mr.
Seward said was all that was necessary
send their Senators and Representatives to
Congress. What will be the practical effect?
Wbv, she will remain in the Union with all
her'slaves, defy Mr. Lincoln's proclama
tion, be restored to'her forts, hold her Se
cession Legislature, and proclaim State
Rights as furiously as ever. The demon of
Slavery and rebellion will be there as much
as ever. This is what is meant by the
"Union as it was, and the Constitution as
it is." Is is a Union with the bloodhounds
who have sprung at your throat and lap
ped your blood till they ceased only for
want"
of strength. This is a construction*}!'
"loyal people" which may suit Mr. Mont
gomery Blair or Mr. Davis, of Kentucky,
(ir Mr.'James Brooks, of New York, or Mr!
Fernando Wood but it does not suit the
loyal people of the West and North, who
have shed their blood, and put I'orth their
strength, and rflfered their wealth to [des
troy the do»H of rebellion. They want the
destruction so complete that the work is
never to be done again. H'Ao, then, are
the loyal people This is the precise thing
Mr. Lincoln has undertaken to define.—
And here we may ask, how came Mr. Lin
coln to offer his definition in a new procla
mation? Why, Mr. Fernando Wood, Mr.
Vallandigham, Mr.Vorhees, andall of that
ilk, are under great concern of inind that
the President has never offered the rebels
any terms of amnesty—told them anything
by* which, iftliey chose, they might return
to their tieloved Uncle, whom they have
so long kicked and cuffed with all their
might. The rebels were equally concerned.
They said: "You are the strongest it is
your business to propose something." Mr.
Lincoln is an amiable man, and a just man
so he says "Yourloyal people may recon
struct your laws and State Governments
and a loyal man is, first, one who obeys my
proclamation, which &ets free all of the
slaves.in South fytrolinn, aud nearly all ev
erywhere secondly, who never took any
part, as an official or responsible person, in
setting the "rebellion going and, thirdly,
who commands neither regiment, brigade,
division, corps or army in the rebel service.
That is all. You who are willing to renew
your allegiance to the laws and Govern
ment of the United States, can just take
your oath to support the Proclamation of
Freedom, and all it.*} incidents then re
instate your State Governments. They
who have taken part as Legislators, Judg
es and Commanders, in getting up this Re
bellion, must take their chance, to be tried
as traitors."
Now, what objection is there to that
mode of re-construction? It offers an am
nesty and re-union to all who will obey the
laus and Constitution as they now are, ex
cept only the leaders. Does any one imag
ine that there are no people in the South to
accept his offer? What interest do you
suppose any man, who is not an owner of
slaves, has in rejecting it? Let us look for
a moment at the number of these people.—
Mr. De Bow, one of the most bitter rebels,
in the Compendium of the United States
Census for 1800, has kindlv furnished us
with the materials for a judgment on this
subject. We will take three States, whose
population has moved but little since 1850,
and show the number of slaveholders and
of non-slaveholders:
Slave- White Males
holders, over 21.
South Carolina, 25,469 70,000
North Carolina, 28,303 140,000
Tennessee, 33 864 151,000
We have in these three States, then, only
87,763 slaveholders, including men, wo
men, children, executors and administra
tors and if we deduct the whole of them
from the able-bodied white males we have
273,237 non-slaveholding voters of these
three States. In other words, the able-bo
died male non-slave-holders of those States
are three timet? in number the slavehold
ers. Nor is that all. Of those 87,000 slave
holders, nearly 40,000 do not own over five
slaves, and 13,000 of them only own one
slave.' Such is the atrocious system of
moral and political viiiainy which has in
volved thirtv millions of people in blood,
disaster and suffering. A poor wounded
soldier of Arkansas said: "We fout, and
fout, and fout, and what was it for All
for our biff men." That is it exactly. A
society founded on tfee principle that one
class of men pan make slaves of another
will always be governed by its big men
not its men of worth, but the "big men,"
of which Slidell, and Benjamin, and Ma
son, and Beauregard, and Letcher, and
Hindman are fine specimens, If our Dem
ocrats and Conservatives want a po
litical society governed in that way, let
them speak out. The question is as sim
ple as a sum in addition. Shall the
Southern States be governed by the im
mense majority of its non slaveholders, or
shall it be governed by an insolent aristoc
racy? Shall the principle of democracy be
sustained, or the principle of property in
man? Dr. Breckinridge said, in his
Thanksgiving sermon, what ought to live
in the heart of every man who loves free
dom, that "the Constitution was made for
the people, and not the people for the Con
stitution." The rebel cannon which fired
on Fort Sumter gave the Government the
constitutional right, under the necessities
of war, to proclaim ltberty to every cap
tive in rebel hands. It has been done, and
it will be sustained. The American nation,
intelligent as it is great, will make the
princtple of freedom the ultimatum of the
war. It would not have been the case bad
the conspirators at Richmond accepted
what was really tho amnesty offered in the
Eave
reclamation of the President. We should
had the rebel States return with Sl-a
very. As it is, we are willing to leave the
question to the real Union men of the
South. Is there any probability that they
will ever call the serpent back? We think
not. Such a baptism of blood and suffer

—CHn, Gaxttc,
Mr. CoMea on Amerltra Affairs.
On the 24th ultimo, Mr. Cobden delivered
his annual address before his constituents
at Manchester. Three thousand persons
were assembled, and the Mayor of the city
presided. Mr. Cobden devoted the greater
part of his speech to a consideration of
American affairs, especially in relation to
the attitude of the British Government to
wards the United States. After a few pre
liminary observations on the necessity of
Parliamentary reform, and of the comple
tion of the free trade system, he spoke as
follows:
THE ADVOCATES OP INTERFERENCE IN
AMERICAN AFFAIRS.
At the present moment there is a party
in this country actively advocating an in
terference in the affairs
"of America. [Hear,
hear.] When I say interference, I mean
we have a party here who are advocating
either recognition or something which
means interference, if it means anything.
[Hear, hear.] I have seen lately a report
of two.meetings of constituencies in the
west «f England—at Bristol and Plymouth
—at which liberal members, representing
popular constituencies, have been recom
mending that the Government should en
ter into arrangement^ with some .foreign
country in Europe, in order that they may
recognize the South in America, and inter
fere to put an end to the war in that country.
["Very proper," and "No, no."]
I observe that the idea which pervades
those members and their constituents was
this, that this affair in America was to be
settled in a peculiar way, according to the
dictates of those particular parties. [Hear,
hear.] From the beginning of this Ameri
can war, this lamentable convulsion, from
which you have suffered so much, one great
and fundamental error in the conduct of
statesmen and governments, and in the
conduct of a largo portion of the influential
classes in this country, has been, that they
have made up their minds that there can
be but one issue to this civil war in Amer
ica, and that is a separation between the
North and the South. [Cheers.] I told
you when I was here last, when that spirit
was, if possible, even more ripe than it is
now, that I did not myself believe the war
would ifcsue in that way. I have stated the
dame opinion since-in "the House of Com
mons yet I declare to you that, taking
what is called by a cant phrase in London
"society," which means that upper ten
thousand with which members of Parlia
ment are liable to come into contact in the
lubs and elsewhere, nineteen-twentieths
of the ruling classes (if I may use the phrase)
that you meet in tho^e purlieus in London,
have been firmly convinced from the first
that the civil war could only end in sepa
ration. [Hear, hear.] How far the wish
was father to that thought I will not pre
tend to say. [Cheers.] 1 believe tho con
viction lias been sincere I believe it, has
been founded on the belief that, looking af
the vast ex
insugents
that they could be subjugated by any forces
that "ould be brought against them bv tho
North.
IONORANCE OK AN AFFAIRS.
But there has been a most lamentable
display t' ignorance amongst those classes
to which I refer, ii' we may judge by the
conduct of the organs of the press which
may be considered the exponents of their
views. There here have been errors in
geography mighty rivers, to which those
in ICngland can btar no comparison, with
hundreds of miles of steam navigation,
havo been described in those leading or
gans as running into one river and into
another, in utter disregard of the rules of
geography. There are a number of
great cities in America—cities of one hun
dred thousand and one hundred and fifty
thousand inhabitants—which are among
the largest shipping ports for raw produce
in the world, in tho interior of that coun
try. In one of them I have seen a mile of
steamboats moored side by side, and yet of
those great cities, and that great commerce,
forming part of the strength and resources
of North America, the ruling classes in this
country know nothing. You don't find
them in books at Oxford and Cambridge,
where your undergraduates are obliged to
study before they can pass their examina
tions.
SUCCESS or THE RF.RF.LI,ION IN AMERICA.
It is in utter ignorance of those resources
that the opinion of the ruling classes in
England has been cume to. Bnt I, whom
accident, perhaps, more than anything
else, has 'made as well acquainted with the
politics and geography of that country as
with ray own, I have never believed—and
I believe now less than ever—that I shall
ever live, or that any one here will live, to
see two separate nations within the con
fines of the present United States of Amer
ica. [Cheers.] I will tell you caudidly
that if it was not for one cause, I should
consider as hopeless and as useless the at
tempt to subjugate the Southern States of
America as the parties do upon whose
views I have been committing. It is the
object with which the separation has been
made that, in my opinion, renders the suc
cess of the secessionists absolutely impos
sible—[hear, hear]—and if the moral and
intelligent population of this country had
not been systematically misled upon that
question they would have been unani
mously of that conviction. [Hear, hear.]
We were told in the House of Commons by
one from whom it was almost incredible
that it could have come—once the great
champion of Democracy, once the great
advocate of all the rights and principles of
the unsophisticated millions—that this
civ.l war originated because the South
wished to establish frpe trade principles
and the North would not allow it. [Laugh
ter.l
THE FALSE PRETENSES OF THE REBELS.
I traveled in the United States in 1859,
the year before that fatal shot was fired at
Fort Sumter which has had such terrible
reverberations ever since. I visited Wash
ington during the session of Congress.—
Now I carry a flag wherever I go when I
travelabroaa, whether in France, America,
Austria or Russia. I at once become the
centre of all those who have strong convic
tions and purposes with reference to free
trade principles. [Hear, hear.] While I
was at Washington I was disappointed at
finding there was so little interest felt on
the free-trade question. There was no par
ty formed, no public agitation, no discus
sion whatever upon the subject. The
Byound, the political field, was wholly oc
cupied by one question, and that question
was slavery. [Hear, hear.] I will men
tion an illustrative fact, which I have not
seen referred to, and to my mind it is con
clusive on this subject. In December, when
Congress was sitttmg, and when the coun
try was in the agony of suspense, fearing
this impending rupture, Congress appoint
ed a committee, consisting of thirty-three
members, being a representative from ev
ery State then in the Union, asd that com
mittee sat from December 11, 1860, to Jan
uary 14. 1861. It was called the Commit
tee of Thirty-three, and was instructed to
inquire into the perilous state of the Union,
ana to try and devise some means by which
the catastrophe of secession oould be
averted. I have a report of the proceedings
of that committee. I believe there is not
another in this oountry I have reason know
so. There are forty pages. I have read
every line. The representatives of the
slave States were invited by the represen
tatives of the free Staes to state candidly
and frankly what were the terms which
they required in order that they might con
tinue peaceably in the Union, and in every
page you see their propositions brought
forward.
From beginning to end of these forty
pages there is not one syllable said about
tariff or taxation. [Cheers.] From begin
ning to end there is not a grievance alleged
but that which is connected with the main
tenance of slavery. There are propositions
calling upon the North to give increased
security vo the maintenance cfUiatiBaU*
tutlon. Tbey are invited to extend tho
Bl,aTery-
make laws by which
fugitive slaves shall be given np. Thev
are .pressed to make treaties with foreign
power by which those powers should be.
required to give op slaves. But from be^
ginning to end no grievance was alleged
but what is connected with slavery. [Hear
hear.] It isglavery, slavery, slavery from
beginning to end. [Hear, hear.]
SLAVERY TNE CAUSE OF THI: WAR.
Is it not astonishing, in the face of facts
like these, that any one could have thi te
merity, with any regard to decency or any
sense of self-respect, to get up in the Ilou4
of Commons and say that the secession oi
the Southern States has been on a question
of free trade and protection! [Cheers.]—
This is a war to extend and perpetuate hu
man slavery. [Prolonged applause.! Itl&
a war not to defend slavery as it was left bv
the ancestors—a thing to be retained, and
to be apologized for. It is a war to estab
lisha slave empire, where slavery shall be
made the corner-stone of the social system
where it shall be defended and iustiiied on
scriptural and ethnological "grounds.—
fCheers.] I say God pardon the men who,
this year of grace, 1863, should think
that such a project as that could be crowned
with success. [Cheers.] Now you know
why I have, from the first, never believed
it possible that the South could succeed,
and I have not founded that faith merely
on moral instincts which teach us to repu
diate the very idea that anything so infer
nal should succeed, No. It is because in
this world the virtues and the forces go to
gether, and the vices and weaknesses are
inseparable. [Applause.]
NATURE OF THE CONFLICT.
It is therefore I feltgrertain that this pro
ject never could succeed. [Applause.] For
how is it? Here is a community with near
ly half of the population slayes, and they
are attempting to fight another community
where every workinginan is a freeman.—
It is as though Yorkshire and Lancashire
were to enter into a confii-1, and i was un
derstood in the case of one, all the laborers
who did the muscular work of the owintiy
in the field, in the factory, on the roads, or
in the domestic establishments—all tho
bone and muscle of the country—should be
eliminated from the lighting* population
and ready to take advantage for them
selves if an opportunity was afforded them
of running away how could a community
so circumstancecl fight against the neigh
boring country where every workingmr.n
was fighting lor his country? How could
the one havo a chance of succeeding, even
if lelt to physical force, without the moral
considerations to which I have referred.—
This is the condition in which the two sec
tions of the United States are now placed.
In the one case you have honor given to in
dustry labor is held to honor. What do
we hear? Have we not heard by way of
reproach by 'orac people who fancied
tent of territory occupied by the themselves ir. a.1 ranee w)t i our aristocracy
in this war, it," was impossible —some of our writers w.io wish to be sup
ould be subjugated by any forces P°'se_d tbey are themseives^ of the aristo-
ratio order—as a stigma against the North,
that their President was onre a rail-spat
ter? [Cheers.] Kui why is that rail-set
ter elevated to be President of the United
States? Because labor is held to honor in
the United States. [Cheers.]
ARISTOCRACY AOA1NST DEMOCRACY.
With such a contii. going on, and with
such a result aw I feel no doubt will follow,,
is it fair to speak of such a contest as that
and say that it is a struggle for empire on
one slue, and for independence on the oth
er? I say it is an aristocratic rebellion
against a democratic Government. [Ap
plause.] That is the title I would give to
it. In all history, when you have had the
aristocracy pitted ngftinst the penp'.o in a
physical force and conflict, the .u istocracy
lias always gone down under the heavy
blows of tln* democracy. [Hear, hear.]—
When I speak thus let nobody say I am
therefore indifferent to the progress of mis
ery and devastation and ruin and bloodshed
that is now going on. No, my indignation
against the South, is thatthey fired tho first
shot and made themselves responsible for
these results. I take, probably, a stronger
view than most people ol' this country—
and certainly a strongerview than anybody
in America—of the vast sacrifices of lit©
and of economical comfort and resources
which must follow to the North from this
struggle. They a^e mistaken if thev think
they can carry on a civil war like this,
drawing a million of men from productive
industry to be engaged in the processes ot
destruction—to spend two or three hundred
millions sterling—they are deluded if tbey
think they can carry on a war like tbat
without a ierriblo collapse, sooner or later,
and a dreadful prostration in every part of
the community. [Hear, hear.] That being
so, makes me still more intolerant of the
cause. But of the result I have no more
doubt than of any subject wbich lies in the
future.
THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPEAN GOV­
ERNMENTS.
Now I would ask you why do some peo
ple wish the United "States should be cut in
two? They think it desirab'e it should b&
weakened." Will that view bear discussion
for a moment? I hold not. I am of the
opinion which onr statesmen were in the
lime of Canning, who thought it desirable
for Europe that America should be strong,
because it would thereby prevent Europe
an powers from interfering in American
affairs. That has been the case hitherto.—
That country has prospered, and it has
never come to interfere with European po
litics, whilst it has kept European govern
ments from interfering in other American
States which have been less prosperous or
less orderly than the United states. What
has followed this disruption You have
France going into Mexico and Spain to St.
Domingo. There are horrors unutterable
going on in St. Domingo, because Spain
has invaded that country—[hear, hear]—
with a view to reconquest. And the French
Emperor has embarked on a career in
Mexico which I will only characterize as
the greatest mistake he has ever made.—
[Loud applause.]
Those enterprises would never have
been undertaken if the United States bat!
not been in this difficulty, and it is the
least creditable part of these enterprises
that they have been undertaken because
America was weak. [Hear, hear.] It only
required tbat the North should have been
a little weaker to have enabled those silly
people who were going about the oountry
to have carried their project, and to have
induced England ana Irance to interfere
to settle the rebellion. [Hear.] Is that de
sirable? [Cheers.] Don't you think we
have enough to do at home? Do you sup
pose that Europe has so little to do that
she can afford to cross over to America t*
set that country in order
The ablest of Canadian papers the Toron
to Globe, opens its comments on the Presi
dent's Message in the following words:—
"The great Southern rebellion is on its last
legs, It may last six months or a year,
hut it is not to be disputed by any fair
minded observer that it is dying. The fail
of Richmond and the flight of Jeff. Davis
and his Cabinet, cannot be far off. The
Globe thinks Mr. Lincoln does not fully
set forth in his message what is to be done
with the South when it is conquered, but
his present movement for the pacification
of the South is of the "pegging away" or
der. "It is not strictly logical, nor is it
eomprehensive, but it may achieve a great
success." The Globe thinks the Southern
people will soon be ready to take the oath
after their armies are subdued, and though
some fierce spirits may long hold oat,
"they will be regarded as the Jacobites in
Britain, who, even within the present cen
tury, have refused to take the oath of fealty
to the Hanoverian line. There will be
commotions and rumors of commotions, a
Ser,
reat army will be needed to preserve or
and the expense will be heavy but In
the end Mr. Lincoln's 'pegging away" will
bring the Southern people to submit to
what ia inevitable,".
