WILL TAPT SPIKE UNCLE
CANNON?
Joe Cannon and Ills coluiuilluu oil
rules prevented the enactment of leg
islation recommended .by President
Roosevelt to such an extent that the
President's policies were treated as
Jokes by the Speaker of the House
and Ills committees. But Roosevelt
is a fighter, and he nominated and
elected a successor pledged to carry
out his policies. Under- such a state
of facts tohat is the president elect
going to' do, or try to do with Can
non?
In legislative bodies in this country,
tho majority caucus is all-powerful.
The United States senate does not
permit the vice president to appoint
or choose a committee, or even a
member of a committee, while the
lower House of Congress has hereto
fore given'its presiding officer: the
power to ji&mc all committees.
If the "republican iUa§fef\ty 4n the
House should hold a*caucus, and de
cide to adopt the proceedure of the
-senate in reference to. selection of
committees, or should even decide to
talce away from' the speaker the
power to name the committee on
rules, the Speaker would be dis
armed and as harmless as one of his
jokes. Something along that line is
in soak for Uncle Joe.
Of course President Roosevelt
duly advised of the dangers of the
African trip which.lie proposes to
start within two weeks after lie re
tiros from the presidency. The writer
has never been near the sea roast in
a tropical-TBuntry, but lie lias often
heard Ills father and other relatives
tell about the deadly fevers which at.
tack white men in the low lands of
the .tropics. Young men who have
never used intoxicating liquors as
beverage and who'are able to take
enormous doses of quinine may witli
reasonable safety spend a few days
in these fever zones but this does not
apply to men of the age and person
fil habits of the President.
THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE.
Tho President's message, which
appears on another page of this
paper, is in some respects an adnn
rable state document. "Roosevelt is
at all times a political conundrum
and the message which he sent to
congress yesterday proves that he
can play two parts with consummate
skill. He threw the whole force of
liis administration against Mr. Bryan
and the$ turned aiw'rito ^ml sent
many ofihe thiqgajjyl$?h be opposed
message- to congress recommending
Mr. Bryan for supporting.
Temperance and Railroading.
Every move toward -greater safety
in travel is bound to. meet with the
cordial approval--of- the general pub
lie, and the railroad man who can
not resist the power of whisky is
fateil to see his .Job go to the man
wlio can. It is for the railroad em
ploye. to choose, and it is a foregone
conclusion that in the great majority
of cases whisky is' going to get the
worst of it.—Des Moines Tribune..
Champ Clark of Missouri has been
selected as the democratic leader 111
the lower houa« of Congress to suc
ceed John Sharp Williams, who has
been elected to the senate by the
state of Mississippi. -Mr. Clark, while
not as brilliant and scholarly as Mi
Williams, is a man of broader views
and more nearly ill step with pro
gressive democratic thought. Mr.
Clark will make an admirable minor
ity leader. swfcs
Andrew Carnegie exploded a bomb
in the standpatters' camp, when he
took the position that most of our
infant industries had attained their
n-ajority and 110 longer needed pro
tectlon. He supported his statement
that steel is produced in this countiy
cheaper than elsewhere by con\incmg
e.luence. But ,h. f-.tetl tust Wiint

one of these $425 pianos will go to
the ybunq lady residing outside of

at the close of the contest while the
other piano goes to the young lady
residing in the city having the most
votes at the close of the contest for
the city only.
Any young^lady can enter, and by
getting her friends interested, can
do wonders and win handsome prizes
not the piano.
An early start will mean much.
Don't vtait. Come in and get re'
ceipt books and get started. We Is
sue for our new subscribers 500
votes for every $3.00 paid on sub
scription, and 400 votes for every
