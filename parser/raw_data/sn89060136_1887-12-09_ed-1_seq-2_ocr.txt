Small Road Districts.
One of the greatest hinderanccs to
a successful road system over whi o h
the board of County Commissioners
have entire control, is the influence
of the local politician- tVhen the
public roads of the entire county are
placed under their manage
ment the appointing power of a host
of petty officers is put into their
hands. This brings swarms of office
hunters to worry them for appoint
ment backed and directed by the lo
cal bosses. The office of the Com
missioners when the board meets for
business is filled with an importun
ing crowd who coax and wheedle,
storm and threaten, and let the board
do their best the disappointed hosts
anathematize them from one end of
the county to the other, and a com
missioner though possessed of the
virtue and wisdom of an angel could
not be elected to a second term if he
wished to be, though we never heard
of one who did.
It is impossible to restrain or
guard against peculation by these
appointees of the board if they are
inclined to rob the county and this
is said to be no rare occurence It
is currently reported that some of
our road officials haye accumulated
snug little fortunes by managing
their office, or taking advantage of
their opportunity. This will contin
ue to the detriment of the tax payers
as long as the care of the immense
number of roads of the county is
placed under the direct management
of the commissioners. And the
scramble will be kept up by local
bosses to seize the office by working
men ; nto the board which they can
manage. The people will at long in
tervals have spasmodic fits of indig
nation and rout the bosses as they
did this year, but the popular indig
nation soon fall to sleep again and
the bosses keep steadily at it and al
■ways at it-
The only remedy for this political
end of the evil of our present road
system is to take out of the hands of
the County Commissioners the larg
est part of the offices now in their
gift, by delegating the power to the
people, in the division of the county
into small road districts, the ex
pense to be incurredjand the roads to
be placed in charge of the tax pay
ers in those districts.
This would certainly insure econ
omy in expenditure as well as bet
ler roads each district being made
responsible for any damage which
ru'ght occur from bad roads within
its territory, in place of the whole
♦ ounty itß at present. The county
commissioners having only a few
Main thorough fares and bridges to
] ok after, would be left without ex
cuse for not maintaining them in the
best of order, and their time would
be devoted to other public business
which is making additional demands
on it as population and business in
creases,
Opening of Congress.
The first-session of the Fiftieth Con
gress opened Monday. In the Senate
ail Senators were sworn in without ob
jection, excepting Mr. Faulkner of
West Virginia, whose case was referred
to the Committee on Privileges and
Elections. A protest against the ad
mission of Mr. Faulkner was presented
ly Mr. Lucas, his Democratic contes
t ut. In the House, John G. Carlisle
was re-elected Speaker. The organiza
tion of the House was completed and
both houses, after appointing commit
tees to wait upon the President, ad
j urned until Tuesday.
The President’s message was laid
before Congress on Tuesday, and is a
Mate paper differing from the common
*rder of suoh documents. The Presi
dent discusses a single subject which
is how to reduce the surplus revenue
■which is constantly accumulating in
ihe Treasury. The surplus of the pres
ent fiscal year ending 30th of June
1888, he estimates will amount to
5H3,000,000. There is already a sur
plU'i in tho Treasury of *700,000,000.
A reduction of the tariff is the remedy
i'er the evil of too much revenue,
strongly urged by the President, and
ihe Carlisle portion of his party strong
ly endorse his views on the subject of
reducing the tariff. The issuo is fairly
made by the President and his party,
nd he gives out fair notice that he
means to stand or fall in the next pres
idential campaign on the question of
not exactly free trade but a tariff great
ly reduced on the necessaries of life,
with a free list for raw materials-

Plana.
While farmers complain of “hard
times” tbay make little or no effort
to soften their line*. Fruit caHurs
is often recommended and urged
with considerable lorce. Hut to be
successful fruit growers is "too much ■
bother” Ah, here’s the rub. The
average farmer does hate “bother,”
which is another name for either
care and thought. It he is permitted
to work all day long like an ox, re- ,
tire to bed at night and aleep like 1
one of the lower animals, bs feels |
satisfied generally that he has per
formed his whole duty as a farmer
and a good citizen. At this day a
machine does the work of a dozen
men, and it has become the province
of the farmer to use less of his nerve
power in physicical exertion and ex
pand more in mental labor.
The farmer in this section of
country is most enviably situated as!
to ready markets for a great variety i
of products, compared with his broth
er farmers in more remote regions.
; The large cities in close proximity j
consume immense quantities of per
ishable produce and bulky products
which are too expensive to be
freighted over long lines of transpor
tation.
Among the fruit products adapted
to this section we may name plums.
On this clay soil the plum tree grows
luxnriently and produces heavy
crops. All that is required to se
cure abundant crops of this moat ex
cellent fruit is care in cultivation
and in keeping the curculio from the
young fruit after it has set till it is
ready to mature. This is readily
done by jarring the trees every
morning and destroying the beetles
when they r fall- This treatment nev -
er fails to insure a crop of perfect
fruit in a favorable season, and the
plum is a sure bearer, seldom failing
to yield well if the ‘‘little turk” is
kept off. And no fruit is of readier
sale at rcnumcrative prices than the
plum. The large city markets are
never glutted with plums, and there
is no more delicious fruit when dried
or made into sauce than plums.
M. Sadi-Carnot was elected President
of the Republic of France by the Con
- gress of Senators and Deqnties at Ver
sailles, on Saturday, in Place of M.
Grevy, resigned. The change of rulers
was effected in a day without a revolu
tion, or riot, or efen a mob. Republi
canism has grown strong in la belle
France when it oan encounter such
changes without a ripple of commotion.
The monarchies of Europe no doubt are
astonished as well as alarmed at this
manifestation of moral power in their
midst- To the imperial power of Ger
many it is a greater menace than all the
armies of Franoe.
The Prohibition National Central
Committee met in Chicago last Wednes

Teachers’ Association.
Communicated.
On Saturday Dec. 3rd, the Teach
ers’ Association of the 6th, 7th, and
Bth districts met in the public school
building ot Port Deposit.
The meeting was called to order
by Pres. Everist at 2:15 o’clock, and
opened with prayer by Rev. Jas.
Conway. The Misses Ball of River
side Academy furnished some choice
music for the occasion, consisting of
two ducts, entitled “Fly Away
Birdie,’’ and “Dream’s Faces,” A
large number of teachers was pres
ent in anticipation ef the lecture by
Rev. Mr. Conway. Hts subject was
‘‘Spelling Reform.” He set forth in
a clear and forcible style a few of
tne many defects.in our spelling, and
also suggested many improvements
that might be made in both, and
showed that while a reform in spell
ing such as he suggested would be a
benefit to all classes; it would tend
to reduce the percentage of illiteracy
by enabling those who are enabled to
attend school only for a very limited
time, to learn to spell and read with
much less labor.
Mr. J. L. Grot hers then answered
the question relerred to him;
“Should Mental Arithmetic as pre
sented by Prof. Brooks bo taught as
a separate branch in our public
schools,” in the affirmative, Then
followed a lively discussion on the
subject, “Were Ferdinand and Isa
bella justifiable in repelling the
Moors.” Messrs. Squicr, Thomas
and Tammany were the disputants.
A vote of thanks was tendered to
Rev. Mr. Conway and tne Misses
Ball, for their services in promoting
the interest of -the institute.
The program for the next meeting
is as follows: Referred questions,
ToS. J. Tammany,. “Explain as you
would to a class, the difference be
tween the use of shall and will.” To
M. 8. Me Maine, “The united ages of
a man and his wife are six times the
united ages of their children. Two
years ago Iheir united ages were ten
time* the united ages of their child
ren, and six years bewce their united
ages will l>c three times the united
ages of their ebildren.” How many
children hare they? To J. L. Croth
ere, “A train started from Albany to
Buffalo at the same time that one
started from Buffalo to Albany. Af.
ter they meet the one that goes to
Albany is six hours on the road.
The one to Buffalo is three. How
long is each train in making the
journey?” To Misa Belle Stewart,
“Where in the United States ia an
object that was probably seen by
Moses?" To Miss Edith Stu bbs,
"What is the circle of illumination?”
, To M. J. Hanna, ‘‘lf from a point
without a circle two tangents be
drawn, prove that if a third tangent
be drawn intersecting these two, that
ti e sum of the sides of the triangle
thus formed will be equal to the sum
of the two tangents drawu from the

MR. BLAINE ON THE MESSAGE
Expressions of His Views of Mr.
Cleveland’s Tariff Recommenda
tions.
The Tribune't Paris correspondent
cables to that paper giving the views
of Mr. Blaine on the President’s mes.
sage. Mr* Blaine spoke as follows:
"I have been reading an abstract of
the President’s message and have
been especially interested la the
comments of the London papers
These papers all assume to declare
the message is a free trade manifesto
and evidently are anticipating an en
larged market for English fabrics In
the United States as a consequence
of the President’s recommendations.
Perhaps that fact stamped the char
acter of the message more clearly
than any words of mine can ”
You don’t mean actual free trade
without duty? queried the reporter.
No, replied Mr, Blaine. ‘‘Nor do
the London papers mean that. They
simply mean that the President has
recommended what in the United
States is known as a revenue tariff,
rejecting the protective feature as
an object, and not even permitting
protection to result freely as an in
cident to revenue dues.”
I don’t quite comprehend that
last point, said the reporter.
I mean, said Mr. Blaine, ‘‘that for <
the first time in the history of the
* |
United States the President recoin- |
mends retaining the internal tax in ,
order that the tariff may be forced <
down even below the fair revenue 1
standard. He recommends that the j
tax on tobacco be retaiued, and thus ,
that many million*annually shall be j
levied on a domestic product which 1
would far better come from a tar- '
iff on foreign fabrics.”
Mr. Blaine favors the repeal of the ;
tobacco tax. He said: “I should (
urge that it be done at once, even i
before the Christmas holidays. It .
would in the first place bring great J
relief to growers of tobacco all over
the country, and would, moreover, i
materially lesson the price of the ar- i
tide to consumers. Tobacco to mil- 1
I'ons of men is a necessity. The j
President calls it a luxuiy, but it is t
a luxury in no other sente than tea t
or coffee are luxuries. 1
“I would not adyise the repeal of
the whiskey tax. Other considera
tions than those oi financial admin
istration are to be taken into account
with regard to whiskey, Thsre is a
moral side to it. To cheapen the
price is to increase the consumption
enormously. It would destroy high
license at once in all the States.
Whiskey has done a vast deal of
harm in the United States. 1 would
use tax to fortify our cities on the
sea board.
Further Mr. Blaine informed the
reporter that he would maintain the
tax on whiskey, so long as there is
whiskey to tax, and when the nation
al government should have no use
for the money I would divide the tax
among the Federal Union, with the
specific object of lightening the tax
on real estate. The houses and (arms
of the whole country pay too large a
proportion of the total taxes. If. ul
timately, relief could be given in
that direction, it would, in my judg
ment, be a wise and beneficient pol
icy.
Concerning protection to wool
growers. Mr. Blaine said : ‘‘l should
seriously object to the repeal of the
duty on wool. To repeal that would
work a great injustice to many inter
ested.’’ The question of labor Mr,
Blaine declared, underlay the whole
subject.”
JONES WAS EXACTLY RIGHT
A Jtaltimore-Street Novel with a
Pointed and Sensible Moral.
Tbe following good story is told
by tbe Baltimore Sun. It is not nec
essary that you should always ad
vertise in tbe Sun. Some other pap
er may serve your purpose just as
well, possibly better. But it is an
' o‘or true tale,” however, and tbe
moral like Solomon’s Proverbs will
will apply every where and through
all time,
A Baltimore street business man
yesterday stood looking out of bis
store window pensively surveying
the crowd of ladies and other shop
pers who were purchasing their
Christmas goods. As the happy buy
ers trooped by a loyk of gloom set
tled itself upon the business roan’s
countenance, and he soliloquized
about bis bad luck.
Here’s a flue go, said he; business
is getting worse and worse every
year, and yet the people all seem to
be purchasing. I can’t understand
it. My grandfather did business in
this house when there wasn't an es
tablishment like it in town. Father
made money here, and yet things go
worse and worse with me every day.
Tbs bouse ought certainly to be well
established. Hello! there goos Jones
•n the other side with a bundle. I’ll
ask him about it.”
Jones came over and said he’d
been out buying Christmas presents
Why I've got those good l , said the
business man; why didn’t you get
them of me?
Here, Jones, tell me the reason I
can’t do business in an old establish
ed house like this?
Why it’s for tbe very same reason
that I forgot you. You don’t adver
tise Who cares a soap whether your
old hense was established in 1730 or
not? D’ye think people are inch id
iota aetoge nosing around for your
pedigree before they buy n box of
matches or a shoestring from you?
Oh ! no. This is the nineteenth cen
tury my boy. Printers' ink—print
ers’ ink is the music every time, and
the Sun your best friend. You've
got to force people to notice you
these daya, and to buy. too. I don’t
mean that you're to stand at tbe enrb
with a club and maul everybody who
doesn’t go in and buy right away;
but keep your name and business
right under people's noses. And if
you have a business pedigree lying
around 100 e, so much tbe better.
Wbat you want is this : When a
man picks up bis Sun at the break
fast table let him see at once that
Simpkins’s house was established in
1730. When he gets down to the
office and picks up the Sun for tbe
market reports or the day’s doings
let him see again, Simpkins, etab
lished 1730. When he tarns back
his Sun ffio to hunt up some item
that he wants to refer to, let him turn
number after number and And repeti
tions of the fact that Simpkins was
established 1730. Oh. I tell you I’aro
right- Who's got the big bow wind
ows and tbe stocks and the fine stores
but the men who advertise. How
are you going to let the public know
where you are and who you are and
when you’re going to give out ebro
mo9 and things if you don’t just let
them know? It Isn't only myself that
you have lost a sale to already, but
to the women folke of my family and
various members of many other fam
ilies all over tbe city. Then there's
the country cousin who can’t get to
town just now on account of hog kill
ing. l>o you suppwse he can know
about your etore by intuition? Not
much.
I guess you're right, said the bus
iness man hopefully. If I have mon
ey left.
If yon have any left? Why. what
are you thinking about? Advertis
ing ought to be your trn duty after
saying your prayers. You go in
strong on printer’s ink, snd my word i
for it you'll And that advertising is
the only thing that will enable you
to have any money left over these
day*. Good day.
