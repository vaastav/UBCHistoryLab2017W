LITTLE RHODY :
FULL OF GRAFT
RiBERY?
Governor Higgins of That State
Delivers Sensational Ad-
dress In Boston, Full of
Vitriol.
REVEALS CORRUPTION
" BEYOND CONTROL
Can't AppeaF To Rotten Bor-
roughs Except For Mercy,
Says He.
BOSTON, Dc- 16. Gov James H.
Higgins, of Rhode Island, bitterly ar
raigned the constitution of his own
state as un-Anlerican and in no wise
fulfilling the conception of civil rights
set forth by the federal constitution
at the Boston City Club last night. 1
a vitrollc speech he laid bare briberj
and graft, whlca he directly attribut
ed to the system of government In
Rhode Island, aad declared that "the
only remedy a hand, for the reform
ers was to agitate and educate a pub
lic, to whom bribery has become a
political function through long y;ars
of practice.
In the opening of one of the r3i
sensational addresses ever made be
OB
fore a Bo3toa civic body. Gov. Hig
gins iiointed out the portion of -.the v .
state constitution which ho claimed
was responsible for the existing evils
This provides Giat each city and
town of the state Is entitled to one
and only one representative to the
- eried. was that toVM?
state senate. The result of this, he
ninety voters, contributed one sena
tor, while Providence with a popula
tion of 250,00,0 people, had only UK
same representation. This, he claim
ed, made It an easy matter for cor
rupt influencestc control, as tho senate-body
reprf4nts only nine per
cent pf the total "vote of the state.
"The disproportionment of repre
sentation. In the legislature and sen
ate," said Governor Higgins, "giving
them the powr to hold up any legis-httion-tlwy
awwifi-feas-Imposed-H-com- -"
plete barrier for enactments which tbe
people of Rhode Island may in great
majorities demand.
"You will a why don't the people
get together and demand a change"
The reason is that the constitution
provides that an amendment cannot be
made except by concurrent action bv
the house and senate two years run
ning followed by a two-fifths vote of
tne state afterwards. You can't ap
peal to tho representatives of twenty
little rotten burroughs except for
mercy. It has been suggested that the
burroughs be bought up two years in
successin, but more money would be
spent by the corrupters. Colonization
has also failed, it has been found thai
this is not legal or practical.
"This disproirortionment is also bad
in the way of taxation. Some towns
receive more from the state treasury
in salaraies than they contribute to
the state taxes. The town of West
Greenich has 414 times the represen
tation than Providence and It contrib
utes less than one thousandth of the
taxation ot the state. It is easy for
bribery to flourish because you don't
have to bribe so many for control.
The result Is that those who are inter
ested In obtaining franchises go down
and debauch enough country towns tt
control the state."
"During my campaign I visited the
town of Exeter and I was surprised to
find that my own committee chairman
had circulated a flier calling on the
voters to demand $5 for the'r vote for
representative; $10 for senator yotes
and $20 for the whote tlckeL I got
after him and he said he was against
bribery but claimed they were going
to send down here and bribe -fliese
voters anyway and he was going ti
make them par for it.
"He told me that If there wasn't any
ODppsition the voters would only get
$2 apiece. Upon inquiry I was told
that there were only six voters who
would not sell their votes, and the
most optoniistic number was given
by a Prohibitionist, who said there
were twenty whose votes could not
be bought.
"So much of this has produced the
feeling that bribery Is all right. Rhod
Island and North Carolina are tae
only states in the union In which tho-
governar has no veto power. It "was -
taken away by Gen. Charles Brayton
two years' ago. The governor has al
so no power of appointments.'
Governor Higgins made serious
charges against Gen. Brayton, whom
ho characterized as "the corrupt per
sonification of political absolutism.
'"Brayton." he said, "up to two years
ago, used to enter the legislative
chamber and sit beside the speaker
end hand him the bills to be passed
upon. For thirty years he has direct
ed the action of the legislature from
room 207 of the state' house. Unlike
Pratt he stays on the Job and person
ally sees that nothing goes wrong.
"Auother abuse Is the power of the
leslslatnr to hold sffice anA vntc fnr
ture and vote for nlmself. But "this Is
of our -supreme court was a lecislr.
tlve member and were elected directly
from the chamhw. Tf it nnli- f.ir- tn
gtate that we have a most romtSirt'nfc
and fair fudlcal b'dy."
