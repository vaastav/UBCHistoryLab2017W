CITY NEWS.
JEST The Criminal Court will be in
session to-day.
Fair. "We learn that the Good
Templar3 of this city propose holding
a festival sometime this month.
S?Tbe young scallawag3 at Prince
ton continue their depredations. It
is somewhat singular that the perpe
trators cannot be discovered.
&2T"0ur readers will find in another
column the announcement of the
Hearth and Ilome, a weekly family
journal of great excellence.
Real Estate Sale. II. Gumberta
sold at auction, on Saturday, about
thirty-three acres of land, located just
above the city, for $75 per acre.
Plenty. If there is any one thing
that is in extraordinary supply in our
city, it ia the mud. We have oceans
of it. The " oceans " arc scarcely
navigable, however.
fita" Dr. O'Leary, the physiological
lecturer, has written to secure Masonic
Hall for a scries of lectures, to be
given in a week or two.
3f Tha doctors say that some of
the green wall-paper3 contain enough
arsenic to kill a person. We shouldn't
wonder, provided any one should eat
enough of tbo nourishing food.
, I, .
This is a poor market for
skates. We ought to have a rink,
and roller skating. The National
Hall would do first-rate, if large
enough, and we believe it is.
lSFSome chap, with an eye to a
good meal, " yanked " a very nice
venison-ham off the rack, in front of
the New York Grocery, one day Itst
County Board. The Board of
County Commissioners will meet in
regular session this morning. Among
the first business to be transacted is
the drawing of a new Grand Jury.
Left. Quito a large party of citi
zens from New Darmony, who had
been sojourning in our city for several
days, left for their homes on the
steamer West Wind on Saturday
evening. '
Returned. Wo are pleased to
note that J. G. Kennedy, Cashier of
the Evansville National Bank, and
Philip C. Decker, of the firm of Ben
nett & Decker, have returned from
New Orleans, after an absence of sev
eral weeks.
Fatal. It seems that Edward
Ruder, aged six years, who was scald
ed by accidentally falling into a kettle
of hot water in Union Township,
early last week, which we noted at the
time, died oa account of the injuries
received.
Congress. This important body
win convene to-day, ana we may jooe
for the President's Message shortly.
We understand that it is not very
lengthy. It 13 hardly probable that
CoDgresa will transact much business
of importance untilfter the holidays.
Educational. Prof. A. M. Gow,
our excellent Superintendent of Pub
lic Schools, will deliver an address
before the Stat3 Superintendents'
Association, at Indianapolis, on De
cember 27th, entitled " Ethical cul
ture in our Common Schools." He
will, no doubt, do the subject justice
Fell In. We learn that the roof
over tho ice house at Kroner's old
brewery, in Jjamasco, cavea in on
Saturday night, crushing the walls
somewhat, and otherwise injuring the
building. We did not learn the cause
of the disaster, or the probable
amount of loss by the same.
Sample Licessz. We notice in an
exchange that Covington. Ky.. has
decided to charge all persons who eel
goods by samples a license feo of
twenty , dollars. It will be rcmem
bered that an effort was made to im
pose a license similar to the above in
our city, but the Council voted it
down almost unanimously.
Post Office Change. Sounders
ville, the name by which the Post
Office at Ingle's Station, oa the E. &
C. Railroad, Vanderburgh County,
has beea cabled, has been cbauged to
Ioglefield, and Charles Morris is ap
pointed postmaster, in place tf John
Ingle, Sr., resigned.
Mr. It gle was, probably, the oldest
postmaster in the United States, hav-
ine been aDDointed by President
Monroe, forty-five years ego, and has
held the office continuously up to the
1st day of December, 18G9, haviDg
occupied his official position through
the administrations of eleven differ
ent Presidents. It is the best testi
monial that can be presented of hi3
fidelity to his trust and the confidence
and esteem of his neighbors. When
be entered on duty, his office did a
larger business than that at Evans
ville, and Shawneetown was the Dis
tributing Office for all this rcg:on of
country in the three States of Indiana,
Illinois and Kentucky. Mr. Ingle is
now in his eighty-second year. How
great are tho changes he has wit
nessed in the society and progress of
v anderburgh County !
Too Poor to Lote. A young man
in this city, whose exchequer was not
in as plethonie a state as he could
wish, and who had been "waiting''
upon a young lady for some time,
finally made up his mind to "pro
pose," but didnot have tho nerve to
make a declaration in propria persona,
so he sent a highly perfumed note
conveying to the lady the information
that he would bo "forever and truly
happy" if she would only say "yes"
to the momentous question he bad
propounded. He waited patiently for
tho answer, which was also written on
"doubla extra" perfumed paper, pur
chased at the Journal office, and
was as follows:
I'd give to thee this hand of mine
If thon but had'st the dimes ;
Bat parses short and slim as thine
"Won it do for these hard times. ,
I leave thee In thy wretchedness,
AS one too poor to mate;
For love, you know, can only bless
When based on real estate.
Carmi Survey. From Robert A.
Hill, Esq., who returned from Carmi
very early yesterday morning, we
learn that Mr. Ilartwell's party
reached Carmi on Saturday night.
The distance from the Wabash River
to Carmi, by the survey, is about
eleven miles. On to-morrow the sur
veyors will start on the return, and
will survey from the Little Chain, on
tho Wabash, to Mt. Vernon, and
thence to this city. It will take them
1 a a, -1 a 1 1 rr
uuout two weeits to get tnrougu. lao
people at Carmi seem to thiik that
the subscription of $100,000 will
probably carry at the coming election.
The indications appear to be favor
able.
Got Loose. A young man bau-
tered Master Hcary Wheeler, one of
tbo "Von Bomelswitzens," on Sat
urday, to let him tie him with a rope,
and agreed, if he got loose, that he
would make him a present of ten dol
lars. Having accepted the offer, he
was tied up in such a manner that it
was not thought possible for him to
get loose. But he went to work with
a will, and af ter one hour's hard la
bor, stepped out of the ropes free.
He refused to take the money, but it
is understood that tho loser will
settle the ecore " for a supper for a
small party. These young Davenport
imitators are certainly " no slouches"
in getting out of the ropes.
Union Prater Meetings. The
daily Union Prayer Meetings will be
held this week in the Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church, corner of Wal
nut and Second Streets. As this loca
tion is the most central to the busi
ness men, the hope has been expressed
that they will endeavor to be present
as often as possible. The meeting is
opened at 8 o'clock, and continues
for three quarters of an hour. This
morning it will be lei by Rev. Mr.
Kumler, and the subject of prayer
and remark " Young Men."
Circuit Court. In the case of Wm.
. P. Mills vs. John B. Mills, the
jury gave a verdict in lavor ot the
plaintiff, awarding judgment in the
sum of $2,550. It will be remembered
that the plaintiff brought suit against
the defendant for his interest and in
surance in the Picayune Mill, de
stroyed by fire in 18G5. A motion
was made for a new trial, but has not
yet been decided.
Judge Baker, of Vinccnnes, pre
sided over tho Court on Saturday af
ternoon ; but little business was trans
acted.
Til 3 Census. The Congress that
meets to-day will soon pass a bill or-
.
ganizing a census liureau lor the
census of 1870. When this is taken, j
we will know exactly the population
of this city, and will bo able to make
accurate comparison with New Al
bany, and other places that claim to
be as big as Evansville. It is proba
ble that the census committee will
recommend to Congress a provision
for the enumeration of the different
religious sects, which has never been
done heretofore.
Not Changed. The question of
changing the hour of the meeting of
the Trinity M. E. Sunday-school,
from 9 A. sr., to 2 P. jr., which has
been talked about for some time, wa3
finally settled yesterday. A vote of
the teachers was taken, and it was de
cided by a large majority not to make
a change; therefore tho school will
meet at 9 A. M. as heretofore.
Muss. We learn that a high old
fight took place, yesterday, at the sa
loon of John Schoeftcr, near the
creek, in Lowei Lamasco, in which
an old German, named John Bitter,
was badly beaten. Who the other
parties were that had a hand in the
fisrht we did net learn, but we under
stand that " things were lively" around
there for a while.
Preaching. There will be preach
ing services in the Walnut Street
Presbyterian Church every night dur
ing the present week, commencing
to-night at 7 o':lock. .Tbo Pastor
will be assisted "'by Rev. W. M. Chce
ver, of Terre Haute, one of the most
popular and effective preachers of the
West. He will doubtless be welcom
ed by good congregations.
"Knucked." Two men, whose
namt s we did not learn, had a quarrel
yetrday afternoon, and one was
struck over -the eye with a pair of
brass knuckles. There was no ar
rest, a3 the injured man belorged on
a fHtboat, and he thought it would
not pay to remain to prosecute.
Council. The City Couacil meets
this evening. We suppose the qu s
tion of makinz an appropriation to
pay the expenses of the delegation to
Washington City will be eettled in
some manner. We are informed that
it is probable the delegation will be
reduced, as it is thought that it is
hardly necessary to send a committee
of five.
More Spinners. Tho proprietors
of the Evansville Cotton, Mills find
ing it necessary to add more machin
ery, two new sets of spinners have
been purchased, which arrived on
Friday, and were hauled to the mill
yesterday. This mill has already ac
quired an excellent reputation, and a
very fine article of domestic is turned
out in largo supply every week. We
learn that further improvements will
be made before a great while.
Closed. Nearly every saloon in
the city was closed yesterday. We
understand there were one or two
exceptions in Lamasco. A number
of saloon keepers say they would be
willing to close every Sunday, law or
no law, if the others would do the
same. Since it is impossible for the
" old nippers " to get any beer on
Sunday, the demand for " ale by the
bor," sent to tlie houses, ha3 largely
increased.
One saloon was kept open, but noth
ing was sold except cider and hot cof
fee. There was an occasional de-
mand for "lager," but tho proprietor
would only shake his head, and point
to a huge card on tho wall labeled
' Q,im J... T . m tt . nJ nnncl-iiil pTt;,
black crapa. No further explanation
wa3 necessary.
Societt Anniversary. Yester
day afternoon was observed by the
(Jermau Catholics as the anniversary
of St. Francis Xavier, but was mere
especially celebrated as th9 anniver
sary of the organization of the Society
of the "Sanct Franciscus Xaverus
Orphan Asylum." The Society num
bers about four hundred members in
this city, each of whom gives twenty
five cents per month towards support
ing the Orphan Asylum at Vincennes,
to which all orphans in this Diocese
are sent to be taken caro of. There
are about two hundred and fifty
orphans at the Asylum at present,
twelve of whom six boys and six
girls came down to this city on Saf
urday, and marched with the proces
sion fiom tho Trinity Catholic Church
to 8t. Mary's. The Crescent City
Silver Band marched at the head of
the procession, and attracted a large
crowd by their fine music. The fit.
Mary's Church was densely packed,
and the exercises were very interest
ing. Theodore Richsten has been
the President 0: this Society, in this
city, the past year, but his successor
was to have been chosen yesterday
evening.
Personal. Gen. James C. Vcatch
passed through the city . Saturday
night en route to Rockport, and is in
excellent health.
Gen. Alvin P. Hovey, United States
Minister to Peru, is in tho city stop
ping at the Sherwood House. He
leaves to-day for Indianapolis, where
he will stop for a few days, and then
leave for Peru via Washington City.
Hon. Robt. T. Glass, Representa
tive from Henderson County, Ken
tucky, was in the city on Saturday en
route to Frunkfort.
Tom Collins, editor of the Mount
Vernon Democrat, was in the city on
Saturday.
Caleb Tolman, of Livermore, with J
his dog Vengeance, or the Black Re
venger, wss in the city, at the Amer- I
ican House, on Saturday. He left by !
the Morning Star Saturday night.
A. H. Cardin, of Marion, Ky., was
in the city on Saturday to renew his
subscription to the Evansville JOUR
NAL, and to subscribe for the Cincin
nati Daily Commercial. With the
two he thinks he can keep himself
fully posted on all that it is important
to know.
W. S. Ford, with his family, arrived
from the East Friday night. Mr.
Ford is now fully established as a
citizen of Evansville.
T. B. Byrne arrived from New
York Friday night, and E. G. Van
Riper and wife arrived yesterday by
the Tarascon.
Church Fair. Tho members of
the Trinity Catholic Church (Ger
man) will give a grand fair next week,
commencing Monday, December 13
and continuing until Saturday. The
fair will be held tor the purpose of
raising funds toward paying for the
splendid new school house that is now
in process of completion on the coi
ner of Vino and Third Streets. It is
proposed to make this festival a truly
grand affair, and we have no doubt
that a large sum will bo realized. The
place where the fair will bo held will
be shortly announced.
Sociable. The members of St.
Paul's Church will hold a " sociable "
this evening, at tho Parsonage,
and Rev. W. H- Vun Antwerp and
lady will do the honors. The congre
gation and friends are cordially in
vited. Those who go may safely cal
culate on a pleasant evening.
Held to Ansttes. Tn the trial of
Dolly Waller vs.' Burder Barker,
(colored) suit in regard to the parent
age of f, colored infant, the defendant
was declared by Justice Emery to be
the father, and was held 1:0 bail in the
sum of $300.
Street Railway. The track has
been laid o. the E ghth Street ex
tension as far oat as Oak Street, and
if the weather would only remain fa
vorable, the work would be finished
in a couple of weeks. A switch is
being put down between Oak and
Canal Streets, and it is probable that
the Main Street switch will be moved
further out that street. The terminus
of the extension for this season will
be at Chandler Street.
Selling without Governbient
License. We have lately had sev
eral parties arrested in this city for
selling liquor without a Government
license. The last case tried was that
of Frederick Schimt, whose attorney
put in the pleathat as hehad only sold
occasionally, and did not follow liquor
selling as a business, he was not lia
ble under tho law. We have just
come across the following decision of
the Commissioner of Internal Rev
enue, sent to a gentleman in Hender
son, which fully covers thi3 case. We
give it below:
Anv r3rsoo or company, of per
sons, who sell liquors " by the small,"
in quantities less than five gallons at
picoic3 or otner places, would be
clearly liable to, and should be re
quired to pay the special tax ot retail
liquor dealer?, without reference to
whether the parties make a business
of selling liquors or not. - - t
Retail Liquor Dealers may close up
their place ot business and remove to
booths at fairs, picnics, etc.. and there
vend liquors during the continuance of
said fair, picnic, etc., at retail and then
again remove to their regular place of
business without becoming liable to the
payment of an additional special tax by
reason of so doing; provided that such
removal be registered with the Assist
ant Assessor and Colhctor, as pro
vided by Sec. 75 of tho Act of June
30th, 1864, as amended. - ' ,
In all cases where parties commence
business subsequently to the month of
May, they should be assessed for that
portion of the year intervening be
tween the first day of the month in
which the business is commenced or
begun and the first day of May en
suing. In concluding paragraph. Sec.
74,. of the act of June 30, 18G4, as
amended by Sec. 9 of the act of July
13, 18CC. v.
Very respectfully,
U. Delano,
v Commissioner.

trps..Tbe Tarascon , yesterday, was full
of freight, and had a large number of pas
aengers...The Kate Robinson was the
first freight and passenger boat that has
passed, nnder the draw bridge over the
falls. Old Tubular-Capt. Jim Kenlston
whose nerves are not naturally shaky,
assures ns that if he had seen the channel
before be started through he would not
have taken the risk. Fortunately, Pink
Varble, tho celebrated falls pilot, bit the
pass exactly, and the Kate came through
howling and without touching. We ex
pect to hear of disasters frequently,
though we hope for better things... By
the Ohio River Telegraph Line we learn
that the St. Marys and Silver Moon passed
over safely, and passed West Point-
mouth ot Salt River late yeUerday even

point. All three will be here about noon.
