report of the secretary of the
INTERIOR.
Secretary Smith says that the report of the
operations of this Department daring the fis2*1
7*** ?<iing J0ne 30,1861, will exhibit n
diminished amount of business in some of the
most important bureaus connected with the
Department, attributable mainly to the insurrection
which has suddenly precipitated the
country into a civil war.
cb**ral laud omcfc.
The decline of business has very sensibly
affected the operations of the General Land
Office. Offici^intercourse has been entirely
suspended with all the Southern States which
contain any portion of the public lands, and
consequently no sales have been made in any
of those States.
In all the Northern States in which any of
the public lands are situated the war has almost
entirely suspended sales The demand
for volunteers has called into the ranks of the
army a large number of that portion of our
people whose energy and enterprise in time of
peace incline them tt> emigrate to the West
fcnd Settle upon the public lands, thus lying
the foundations of future prosperous communities
and States Besides, the ordinary
channels of traae and commerce hare been so
obstructed br the war that the sources of income
from which the settlers upon the public
lands have realized the means of purchasing
hare been greatly diminishedOn
the 30th September, 18(11, there were
55,555,595.2j acres of the public lands which
had been surveyed but not proclaimed for
public sale. The lands surreyed and offered
At public sale prerictis to that time, and than
subject to prirate entry, amounted to 78.662,735.64
acres, making an aggregate of publio
lands surreyed and ready for saie of 134,218,330
89 acres.
Since the last annual report ef this Department
no proclamation for a public sale of lands
has been made, as the quantity already subject
to private entry is more than sufficient to meet
the wants of the country. During the fiscal
year ending 30;h June, 1861, and the first quarter
of the current year, ending 30th September,
1361, 5.289.532.31 acres have been disposed
of. Of this amount, 1.021,493.77 acres
have been certified to the States of Minnesota,
Michigan and Louisiana under railroad grants
made br Congress; 606 094 47 acres hare been
certified to States as swamp landr; 2 153,040
acres have been located with bounty land warrants,
and 1.508,004 07 acres have been sold
for cash, producing $925.299.42.
It will be seen from this statement that the
public lands have ceased substantially, for the
present at least, to be a source of revenue to
the Government. The liberal manner in which
the aets of Congress granting swamp and overflowed
lands to the States have been construed
and executed, the grants ef large quantities to
aid in the construction of railroads, and the
quantity required to locate bounty land warrants
for military servioea, hare combined to
reduce the cash sales to an amount hut little
more than sufficient to meet the expenses of
our land system. The net income from sales
during the last fical year will hardly reach the
sum of $200,000.
The propriety of issuing bounty land warrants
to the volunteers who have been called
into service to suppress the existing insurrection
is already a subject of discussion, and
must b? determined by Congress. A warrant
for lrto acres to each volunteer engaged in the
service would absorb over one nunared minions
of a.'re?? much larger amount than has been
issued under all previous laws. It is evident
that the issue of such an amount of warrants
would destroy all hope of deriving any revenue
from the publij lands, at least for many years.
And, while such a measure would deprive the
Government of all income from this source, it
would afford but little benefit to the volunteers.
These warrants are now sold in the
market at about fifty cents per acre. An addition
of tae large amount necessary to supply
the volunteers would necessarily reduce the
price of them to a merely nominal sum.
The bounty of the Government, dispensed to
the rolunteers in this form, would fail to realise
to them the adrantegea intended. All the
best lands would fall into the hends of apeculators,who
would be enabled to purchase them
at a nominal price, and sell them to settlers at
full prices a* fast as emigration to the West
would require them for settlement. If additional
compensation to the rolunteers, beyond
the amount now authorized by law, shall be
deemed just and proper, it will be better both
for the Government and the rolunteers to
compensation bj a direct appropriation
of money, or of Government securities
This would give them the full benefit of the
appropriations made, while the Government
would, by keeping the lands until they shall
be demanded for settlement, realise their full
ralue.
IXDIA!! AFFAIRS.
Our Indian affairs are in a rery unsettled
and unsatisfaetory oondition.
The spirit of rebellion against the authority
of the Government, which has precipitated a
large number of States into open revolt, has
been instilled into a portion of the Indian
^ribes by emissaries from the insurrectionary
The large tribes of Cherokee*. Chickasaws
and Choc laws, situated in the southern superintendency,
hare suspended all intercourse
with the agents of the United States.
The superintendent and agents appointed
since the 4th of March last hare been unable
to reach their poets or to hold any intercourse
with the tribes under their charge. The superintendent
and some, if not all, of the agents
of the southern superintendence who were in
office on the 4ih of March, hare assumed an
attitude of revolt to the United States, and
have instigated the Indians to acta of hostility
Some of these, whe lately held their offices
under the United Statea, new claim to exercise
the same authority by rirtue of commissions
from the pretended Southern Gorernment.
Although the Indian Offioe baa not been able
to procure definite information of the oondition
of affairs, and of the extent to which the
Indians hare assumed a hostile attitude,
enough haa been ascertained to leare no room
for doubt that the influencea which hare been
exerted upon the Indians hare been aufficient
to induce a portion of them to renounce the
authority of the United States and to acknowledge
that of the rebel gorernment.
It haa been currentlr reported, through the
press, that a portion of them hare been organized
as a military force, and are in arms with
the rebels; but the Department has no official
information confirming these rumors.
The hostile attitude assumed by portions of
the tribes referred to haa sesulted from their
fears, produced by riolence and threats of
emissaries sent among them, and the withdrawal
frcm their vicinity of the'troopa of tho
United States, whose presence would hare
aff rded a guarantee of protection. It is unfortunate
that the War Department has been
unable to aend to that region suoh a body of
tr jopa as would be adequate to the protection
of tnoee tribes and rerire their oonfidence in
th? ability aa well as the will of the United
S:atee to comply with their treaty stipulations.
Cat off from all intercourse with loyal citisens;
surrounded bv emissaries from the rebels who
represented that the Gorernment of the United
Sates was destroyed, and who promised that
the rebel government would assume the obligations
of the United States and pay their annuities;
aasailed by threats of violenoe, and
eeeing around them no evidenee of the power
of the United States to proteet then, it is not
surprising that their loyalty was unable to resist
sueh lnflaenees. Many white men of far
Elater intelligence have joined the insurreonists
against their own convictions of right
under much less pressure
We heve reason to believe that as soon as
the United Strtes shall re-establish their authority
in the Indian country, and shall send
there a sufficient foree fer (he protection of the j
tribes, they will renounce all connection with
toe rebel government and resume their former

relations with the United States. The payment
of their annuities has been suspended
The tribes upon the Pacific slope of the
Kocky Mountains have manifested a turbulent
spirit, but have committed no acts of violence.
With vigilance on the part of the agents it is
hoped they may be restrained from depredations
upon the white settlers, and be gradually
brought under the control of the laws of the
United States.
Mtich trouble haa been experienced in New
Mexico from depredations committed by some
of the tribes in that Territory The withdrawal
of the troops of the United States has
encouraged them to acts of violence, while the
active interference of disloyal persons from
Texas has induced them to disregard the laws
and authority of the Government. The presence
of a military force in that Territory i?
indispensable to preserve the peace and cause
the Indians to respect the laws.
patent office.
No branch of the public service connected
with this Department has been so much affected
by the insurrection of the Southern
Mates as that of the Patent Office.
The receipts of the office from January 1st
to September .10th, 1861, were $102 806. IS'
and the expenditures were $185,594 05, showing
an excess of expenditures over receipts of
$32,79o 87. r
During the corresponding period of the last
I"' ihl receipt! were $197,348.40. being
$94,840 -2 more than the receipts for the same
part of this year. During the same period
3,514 applications for patents and 519 caveats
have been filed, 2 581 patents have been issued,
and 15 patents hare been extended.
To meet this deficiency in the income of the
office the Commissioner, with the consdrrence
of the Department, has reduced the clerical
force by the discharge of thirty of the employees,
and reduced the grade of the remainder
in order to lessen their compensation
By this reduction it is believed by the Commissioner
that the expenditures will be brought
within the receipts. I
pension office.
The casualties of the conflict in which the
Government is now engaged will increase the
list of pensioners very largely. The amount
of increase cannot be estimated, as it will I
depend upon the duration of the war. The I
large amount of business which will necessarily
be thrown upon the office from this cause will
render an increase of the clerical force em- I
ployed indispensable.
The Commissioner of Pensions, with the
concurrence of the Department, has construed
the pension laws now in forco as authorising
the granting of pensiens to invalids and the
Jj ren ?f d<*0"?d soldiers who
have been killed or wounded In the existing
insurrection. If this construction of the laws I
should be deemed improper the corrective is I
with Congress.
