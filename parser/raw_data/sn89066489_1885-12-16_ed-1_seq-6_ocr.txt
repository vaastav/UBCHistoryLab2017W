WEDNESDAY,! DEC. iC,
The president's message, which
.vas read to c--tigress last week, wi
full of good, plain, hart! sense and
practicable cuggetions.
Col. ( rockttt, ot the Nevada
Democrat, denies the statement that
Mayor Gillespie wi 1 take charge of
iis paper after h.s enstallment as I.
Mat that place.
Senatorial candidates announced
are; Judge Sherwood, . N. Uurnes
and F. M. Cockrell. We would
like to I ear fiom some man that has
.lot been holding; office a lifetime.
The gts works at Kansas City
were blown upTuesday ot last week,
jtnd tor a tune the city was left in
total daiknes. Coal oil lamps and

now answer as a substitute.
The tear i an utbieak of the
Mormons has cau-ed the govern
ment to dispatch Company IK with
6 field pieces and 400 troops from
Ft. Omaha. Salt Luke City is now
picketed with U S n.. (.

ihe time has been when he would
Jet up in the middle of the night to
work for Frank Cockrell, but certain
.developments ot late have some
what changed his mind, and he can
low be found on the tence.
We see from the Columbia Herald
?hat Capt. J. W. Kneislev, ex rep
resentative of that county has been
appointed custodian of the public
'Holdings jn Si Louis. Wonder if
the oh' man will ''hoof it" to St
Louis, us he did to Jefferson the
inie he was elected representative?
A special dispatch from Washing
ton to the Globe-Democrat an
nounce that in all probability out ot
the naif dozen senators selected bv
the president to represent the ad
ministration on the floor of the
senate, George G. Vest has been
chosen , the mouth-piece through
.vhom the president will talk.
The Lamar Democrat thinks Berry
Thurman, of that city, will be the
next man to keep Judge Burton's
seat warm in the judicial chair ot
ihat circuit. Thurman, Thurman?
Well, that is a very familiar name
to us and we rather like it. Suppose
Ihe democracy of that district try him
one term. We believe he would
uit all right.
Affairs in Utah are taking rather
queer turn. The Mormons are
retaliating; on the Gentiles for inter
ering witli their polygamous habits
by having; some of the high officials
of the State arrested on the same
charges. This is accomplished by
getting women to entice the unms
meeting officials into forbidden paths
and then "chirp on them.
Tax Payer, through the columns
oi last week's Rockville Globe, does
considerable figuring in regard to
ihe bonds of that township. Tax

The Democrat is right; it is about
time that this question was being
discussed and decided upon by the
democrats of Dates county. The
..1 11 i...v-..i:.-
campaign will, in an piuu.i..,
open up by the February term ot
circuit court. In fact, many of the
bovs are already champing the bit
a.id anxiously awaiting the drum tap
to be off. The rules governing the
1 .... k.il' !.. iti
r ice, as to wnemei c
primary or convention system, is of
i.otiance to the iimes, except
X
so far as the good of the party is
concerned. The prunar system
gave very general satisfaction betote
and all the cry, which usually fol
lows a convention, and m most cases
justly so, of ring, combustions,
trades, etc., was avoided. Of course
it is poisible to have frauds in pri
maries such as repeaters and ille
gal voters, but if good and compe
tent officers are selected to conduct
the election all this can be avoided
Then every democrat has an equal
voice in saving who the party candi
date .shall be, and not be compelled
to vote for a man whom a ie-vv
political bosses dictates, and w hose
only qualifications tor office is that
he happens to stand in with the ring.
We repeat that cither sVtm would
be pertectlv satisfactory wiilt llie
Times; but, tor the good ' the
democratic partv, we are co.npeiied
to favor the Democrat's suggestion,
and 00 not see that the party could
do better than by retaining ihe ii i
mary election system. We would
like to hear from good democrats ali
over the county 011 this subject. The
democratic county central committee
will have jurisdiction in the matter,
but of course they will be governed
by the wishes of the people.
JOHN P- WILLIS-
On Monday last Colonel Elijah
Gates, United States 'Maishal, ap
pointed John I. Willis his first or
circuit deputy Marsha!, lie was
sworn in before the U. S. Ciicuit
Court and commissioned the same
day. This is a splendid appoint
ment for Mr. Willis, and the people
of Bates county irrespective ot poli
tics will reioice over his success.
Mr.' Willis is a live energetic man,
a sterling democrat, generous to a
fault and is as brave as a lion in the
discharge of his duties, and will nev
er falter or shirk no matter how haz
ardous the undertaking. Col. Gates
could not have selected a better man
for the position or one who would
have given better satisfaction to the
people ot Bates county. Mr. Willis
was a prominent candidate for the
Marshalship and was strongly recom
mended from all over the State.
The Times greatly rejoices over the
recognition ot a Bates county man
and heaitily congratulates Mr. Wil
lis on his appointment.

The following ftVurc- ;(re based
on statement's from official sources.
I commend them to the careful con
sideration of tax-payt-rs. The 3gent

the bonds seems to be unwilling or
unable to make a full statement ot
the condition of matters entrusted to
his care and it 1- eminent. y prepet
that tax-pavers shouul take care to
protect tneir interests.
It these figures ::rc' materially
wrong, let who can correct them. If
tliev are substantially correct, if ihe
diacrepency shown is ita!. let the
people see to it in lime. In anv
event it is the people's right to know

The appointment of Mr. Garth
settles the fact that Juefge Gantt, ot
Henry county, will be in the field for
congress next fall, and it is well known
that he will worry the modern Cicero
ot the Southwest no little in the
nominating Convention. Mr. Stone's
popularity does not rest on as hich a
plane as it did one year ago, and if
appearances denote anything he will
never write a book entitled "Twenty
years in Congress" or even four
years. Appleton City Journal.
Judge Gantt has a host of warm
friends throughout this county, who
are only waiting for him to say the
word and hit the brush. Liates county
will nor be alone, the bands fvill le
gm to plav a!! along the line.
1 here is a strong undercurrent at
woik among the republicans to op
pose, in tl e Senate, Mr. Cleveland's
appointees wr.o were put in ovei
displaced republicans. We opine s
t..at tins i onlv a false alarm, ami
only a few isolated cases of the kind
may be looked for. and those tor just
cause. This -fyth Congress is very
similar to its predecessors in the tact
that it will not wilfully and malic
iously ttample upon established
customs which htsve been in vciie
ror so manv wh. m iti
Total S70.31S.65
That is to say, our compromise
bonds and payments added to bonds
and interest yet outstanding repre
sent an original indebtedness of
$70,218.65, which is $13,2 iS. 65
greater than the bonds of 1S71 anil
interest would have reached had
there been no adjustment of the
debt.
Let the people see to it and find
out the truth 111 the premises. The
longer it is put off the more difficult
it will be to get a proper understand
ing of the matter. Delay is danger

If the above statement is correct,
the tax payers of that territory should
call a halt in proceedings and de
mand an investigation ; if not correct,
the financial agent, Mr. Catron,
should explain awav discrepencies.
In either event it is but justice to
these people that a full and com-
pletegstatement ot this whole affair.
from the issue of the bonds to the
compromise recently consumated, be
made out by the financial agent and
submittedfto them ; then, it there has
been any fraud in the management,
it can easily be discovered.
