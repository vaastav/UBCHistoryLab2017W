A fiUautge 8trr Oo tb 18th of April, 1868, in tha rioo of Villarica, (.Province of Mi ne tieraen, in Brazil, two men nnin d Arerio and Car i lies woro executed at the bam litno. in Brazil, exe cution take place with cloned door, tu the interior of tho prion. Dr. Lorenao y Curino, of Jiio Janeiro, vuli knowu by cervant for his re markable works on electricity ap plied to physiology, hie eurgical tkill, and his ucce in autoplastic operaliona, obtained pormission to profil by this ovent, in order to ex periment on the power of electrici ty, and to illuDlruto its analogy with aume of the phenomena of lifo. The uaraerou exporiments hitherto ut tanipted have been undo ou tho bead and trunk aepurately. Dr. Lo re u coy Carnio's dexign was, il'possi bU, to uoile lb head after decupi tation. The head of tho two criminal (II. within a few minutes of ench ether, into the namo baskot first that of Carincs, then that of Avciro. Immediately after this second exo cation a compression was effected by a pupil of Dr. Lorenzo on tho carotid artery of one of the beadH, eo as to stop the hemorrhage. The body was thon placed on & bod al ready prepared, and Dr. Loronao atnek the bead as exactly as possi ble en the section, and kept it in tbat position. The cells of a powor ral electric pilo wore applied to the base of the neck and en the breast. Under this influence, as in former experiments, the respiratory movo nents were at once perceptible. As tb blood which penetrated in abun dance through the surface of the tear threatened to stop the passage f tbe air, Dr. Lorenzo had recourse to tracheotomy. J(epirntion men .naned reinilarlv. I ho head was batened to the body by stitchos and by a special apparatus. The physi uliwin wished to ascertain for how long a time this appearance of life avuld thus be artificially maintained. His astonishment was groat wbon ksaw at the end of two hours not slid respiration still continue under, tfae influence of tho electric current, but that circulation hnd even re canted cetain regularity. The palie beat feebly but Bonsibly. The tperiment was continued without iotermission. At the end of 72 hours it was evident, to tho astonishinont f every rno that a process of cica trization had commenced on the lips of the section. A little later aigna of life manifested themselves spontaneously in the bead and limbs, till then deprived of motion. At this moment the director of the prison, arriving for the first time in the experiment room, observed that by a singular mistake duo to tho baste of the operation, the head of Cannes bad been taken for that of Aveiro, and bad been applied to tho kody of the luttor. The experiment was continued notwithstanding. Thro days luter the respiratory movements reproduced themselves, end electricity waa suppressed. Dr. Lorenzo y Carmo ana bis assistaut wer stupefied, frightened at a r aU so unexpected, and at the power of In agent which, in their band, bad restored life to a body whoso right to exist tbelaw had lorfeited. ?Th learned surgeon, who bad only had in view a aimplo physiol ogical experiment, employed all his skill to continue this work, which science, aided, against all expecta tion by nature, bad eo singularly commenced. He assisted tb pro re of cicatrization, which progress ed ander th mst favorable condi lione. By means of an orspphagian probe, liquid nourishment waa In troduced into tb Btomach.

Be il as il may, a strange inertia seems to possoss lbs mass es. There seams to be no end to their tame submission to tbe most outragoous cots of the bald villsius who are enriching themselves by taxing tbe property of'lbe poor everywhere, aud heaping tbe most onerous hardens upon both rich and poor in the manacled South.
