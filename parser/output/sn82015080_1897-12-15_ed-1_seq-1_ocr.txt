The city of Topeka, the capital city of Kansas, through its council, has passed an ordinance, under and by authority of chapter 82, session laws of 1897, requiring a reduction of 20 per cent, in all water rates. This action is significant in that by unani mous vote of the city fatv-ers of our capital city, advantage is taken of the provisions of a law, scorned by Re publican leaders, and dubbed by Re publican journals as "s cialUtic," "anarchistic," and "foolish." When this law was adopted by the the Populist legislature of 1897, it aroused such remarkable degree of criticism and ridicule that it was tak en up by Eastern contemporaries and brooted about as one of the crank freaks of the Western advocate of re form. We were told by these gentle men that it was decidedly comical the way a lot of Kansas "grangers" had attempted to formulate a law regula ting and restricting corporate jriv ilege as applied to municipal govern ments; that they possibly knew suffici ent of the needs of cities to make themselves generally ridiculous, and that they could more properly repre sent their constituency by "directing the channels of legislation to the prop er building of stone fence and the raising of Berkshire pigs." Prior to that time, however, our railroads wcie run as suited the rail roads for favors received; wild cat and other insurance schemes were reg ulated by a hireling stationed at To peka for the purpose of making rates to suit the schemes; our school books were costing us SO per cent, more than they are at present, and the school book trust was a synonym of good government; federal injunction was the sovereign will of the, universe; our state treasury was the receptacle for illegal vouchers paid for work never performed; a restriction of the right to municipal franchises at pleasure was acontlnguency not to be tolerated; our state government was figure-head, as costly as it was inanimate, and the people were presumed to be satisfied with the disguised methods employed by these "benefactors" to deceive them into submission. But now? But observation is unnecessary. The Topeka Water company is told in plain terms that its rates must be re duced; that the Pop law is a good one, and Topeka means to utilize it for self protection; that unless such reduction of rates is made within a reasonable time, Topeka, the capital city of Kan sas, will proceed under this Pop law to condemn its water works, take con structive possession of its plant, direct its operation, and take charge of its receipts and disbursements allowing it 6 per cent, on the actnal capital in vested. And what is of still greater impor tance is the fact that this Pop law . furnishes Topeke the constitutional means of accomplishing that desirable end. Score another against the Pops. AN EfllNENT JURIST Endorne Uovrrnor Leedy'a "Public L'tlllty" Recommendations. Special Correspordent. The Kansas City World of Thurs day evening says: There is a striking similarity in Governor Leedy's message vetoing the railroad bill and the article written by Judge Walter Clatk, associate justice of the supreme court of North Caro lina, entitled "Rights of the Public Over Quasi Public Services," which appeared in the October number of the Arena. The similarity is in the thought rather than in the language. In fact there is hardly a single sentence in either production which would sub stantiate the charge of plagiarism. Governor Leedy s message was transmitted on March 9, nearly eight months before Judge Clark's article appeared, so that if either plagiarized the thought, the credit of originality must be given to Governor Leedy. Ia the last naif of his message, Gov ernor Leedy discussed the proposition of the right of a state to regulate quasi public concerns and to pass laws fixing a schedule of maximum rates to - be charged. The same proposition is the subject of Judge Clark's article. Both Governor Leedy and Judge Clark started out by quoting Justice Sir Mathew Hale, as" the preliminary foundation for the argument. They treated the subject the same way, ad' - dressed the same propositions, cited the same authorities and arrived at the same conclusions. ' In his message Governor Leedy cited decisions of the United States supreme court in . the following cases: Munn vs. Illinois, Ruggles vs. Illinois, Budd Y. New York? Bross vs. North Dako- ta,, Regan vs. Trust company, Stone vs. Farmers' company, Dow vs. Beidle man. Judge Clark cited every one of the above cased in almost the same order. He cited a few more cases, but they were merely inc:dental. His entire argument was built -upon the above list of decisions. Both Judge Clark and Governor Leedy arrived at the same conclusion, that the state has the right, under the constitution and according to the de cisions of the United State's supreme court, to regulate quasi public con cerns and establish a schedule of max imum rates for them to charge. Judge.Clark is one of the most ad vanced thinkers of the present time. He contributes frequently to leading magazines, and his articles never fail to attract widespread attention. His name has frequently been mentioned in connection with the Democratic vice presidential nomination three years hence as a running mate for W. J. Bryan. Governor Leedy feels quite compli mented that his position has been sus tained and indorsed by a man of the high judicial position of Judge Clark. ncKINKEY'S 

EFFORT. Approve tlte Monetary Scheme f Necretary Unite. Washington, D. C, The message of President McKinley is a lengthy document, and is taken up largely with explanations of why certain things have not been done, and as to methods of doing nothing with refer ence to certain questions now confront ing the people. As the currency and Cuban ques tions are the only ones discussed of special importancet we give the rec ommendations on those questions in full: "It is manifest that we must devise some plan to protect the government against bond issues for repeated re demptions. We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our demand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We have $900,000,000 of currency which the government by solemn en actment has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is obliged to re deem in gold but the government. The banks are not required to redeem in gold. The government is obliged to keep equal with gold all its out standing currency and coin obliga tions, while its receipts are not re quired to be paid in gold. They are paid in every kind of money but gold, nd the only means by which the gov ernment can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can get it in no other way when it most needs it. 

GOVERNMENT AT A DISADVANTAGE. The government without any fixed gold revenues is pledged to maintain gold redemption, which it has steadily and faithfully done, and which, under authority now given, it will continue to do. ' The law which requires the govern ment after having redeemed its notes to pay them out again as current funds demands a constant replenishment of the gold reserve. This is especially so n time of business panic and when the revenues are insufficient to meet the expenses of the government. At such time the government has no other way to supply its deficit and maintain redemption but throught the increase of its bonded debt, as was done under the administration of my predecessor, when $262,315,400 of 44 percent, bonds were issued and sold and the proceeds used to pay the ex penses of the government in excess of the revenues and sustain the gold re serve. While it is true that the great er part of the proceeds of these bonds were used to supply deficient revenues, a considerable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve. MUST ISSUE BONDS. With our revenues equal to our ex penses, there would be no deficit, re quiring the is uance of bonds. But if the gold reserve falls below $100,000,- 000 how will it be replenished except by selling more bonds? Is there any other way practicable under the exist ing law? The serious question then is, shall we continue the policy that has- been pursued in the past, that is, when the gold reserve reaches the point of danger, issue more bonds and supply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means to prevent these recurring drains upon the gold reserve? If no further legislation is had, and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then Congress should give the Secretary of the Treasury author! ty to sell bonds at long or short per iods, bearing a less rate of interest than is now authorized by law. x earnestly recommend as soon as trie receipts oi tne government are quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government that when any of the United States notes are presented tor redemption in gold and are re deemed in gold: such notes shall be kept and set apart, and only- paid out in exenange lor gold. xms is an obvious duty. If the holders of the United. States note prefers the gold and gets it from the government he should not receive back from the gov eminent a United States note without paying gold in exchange for it. The reason for this is made all the more apparent when the government issues an extra bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes a non-interest bearing debt. Surely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put ou: in any other way, they may return again to be followed by another bond issue to redeem a non-interest bearing debt. In my view it is of the utmost im portance that the government should be relieved from the business of pro viding all the gold required for ex changes and export. This responsi bility is alone borne by the govern ment without any of the usual and ne cessary banking powers to help itself. The banks do not feel the strain of the gold redemption. The whole strain rests upon the government and the size of the gold reserve in the treas ury has come to be, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of se curity. This ought to be stopped. If we are to have an era of prosper- ty in the country with sufficient re ceipts for the expenses of the govern ment, we may feel no immediate em barrassment from our present cur rency; but the danger still exists and will be ever present, menacing us as long as the existing system continues. And besides it is in times of adequate revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst. We cannot avoid without serious consequences of wise consider ation and prompt solution of this question. The secretary of the treasury has outlined a plan in great detail for the purpose of removing the threatened recurrence of a depleted gold reserve and save us from future embarrass ment on that account. To this plan I nvite your careful consideration. I concur with the secretary of the treasury in his recommendation that national banks be allowed to issue notes to the face value of the bonds which they have deposited for circula tion, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduced to one-half of one per cent. :r annum. I also join him in recommending that authoritt be given for the estab lishment of national banks with a minimum capital of $25,000. This will nable the smaller villages and agri cultural regions of the country to be supplied with currency to meet their needs. I recommend that the issue of na tional bank notes be restricted to the denomination of ten dollars and pwards. If the suggestions I have herein made shall have the approval of Con gress, then I would recommend that national banks be required to redeem their notes in gold. 

CUBA. Turning to the practical aspects of a recognition of belligerency and re viewing its inconveniences and posi tive dangers, still further pertinent considerations appear. In the code of nations there is no such thing as a naked recognition of belligerency un accompanied by the assumption of in ternational neutrality. Such recogni tion without more will not confer upon either party to a Democratic conflict a status not therefore actually possessed or affect the relation of either party to other states. The act of recognition usually takes the form of a solemn proclamation of neutrality which recites the de facto condition of belligerency as its mo tives. It announces a Democratic law of neutrality in the declaring state. It assumes the international obligations of a neutral power in the presence of a public state of war. It warns all citi zens and others within the jurisdiction of the proclaim ant that they vie late those righteous obligations at their own peril and cannot exoect to be shielded from the consequences. The right of visit of search on the seas and seizure of vessels and cargoes and con traband of war and good prize under admiralty law must under internation al law be admitted as a legitimate con sequence of a proclamation of belliger ency. IT WOULD HEW SPAIN. While according equal belligerent rights, defined by public law, to ach party in our ports, disfavors would be imposed on both, which while nomin ally equal would weigh heavily in be half of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and controlling the ports of Cuba her maritime rights could be asserted not only for the military investment of the island, but up to the margin of our own territorial waters and a con dition of things would exist for which the Cubans within their own dominion could not hope to create a parallel; while its creation through aid or sym pathy from within our dominion would oe even more impossiDie tuan now with the additional obligations of in ternational neutrality we would per force ttssume. The enforcement of this enlarged and onerous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own jurisdiction by land and sea and ap plicable by our own instrumentalities, It could impart to the United States no jurisdiction between Spain and the insurgents. It would give the United States no right of intervention to en force the conduct of the strife within the paramount authority of Spain ac cording to the international code of war. INTERVENTION. For these reasons, I regard the recog' nition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents as now unwise and there lore inadvisable, should that step hereafter be deemed wise as a meas ure or right and duty, the executive will take it. Intervention upon humanitarian grounds has been frequently suggested and has not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest consideration. But sh uld such a step be now taken when it is apparent that a hopeful change has supervened in the policy of Spain toward Cuba? A new gov ernment has taken office in the mother country. It is pledged in advance to the declaration that all the effort in the world can not suffice to maintain peace in Cuba by the bayonet; that vague promises of reform after subju gation afford no solution of the insular problem; that with a substitution of commanders must come a change of the past system of warfare for one in harmony with a new policy which shall no longer aim to drive the Cubans to the "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or succumbing in misery," that reforms must be institu ted in connection with the needs and circumstances of time, and that these reforms, while designed to give full autonomy to the colony and to creat a virtual entity and self controlled ad ministration, shall yet conserve and affirm the sovereignty of Spain by a just distribution of powers and bur dens upon a basis of mutual interest untainted by methods of selfish ex pec" iency. The first acts of the new government lie in these honorable paths. The pol icy of cruel rapine and extermination that so long shocked the universal sen timent of humanity has been reversed. Under the new military commander a broad clemency is proffered. Measures have already been set on foot to re lieve the horrors of starvation. The power of the Spanish armies, it is asserted, is to be used not to spread ruin and desolation, but to protect the resumption of peaceful agricultural I pursuits and productive industries. That past methods to force peace by subjugation are futile, is freely admit ted, and that ruin without conciliation must inevitably fail to win for Spain the fidelity of a contented dependency. The special committee appointed by the Wellingtdn council to sink a well the western "part of the city to ascertain if there is not an inexhaust ible supply of water underlying that part of the earth's surface, are meet ing with varied success. When a sufficient depth has been reached to warrant a test of the water supply, a pump, which will elevate to the sur face 1,000 gallons per minute, will be placed in operation and a thorough test will be made. If the water supply withstands the test, another pump of equal capacity with the first, will be nserted into the well and a still further test made. These pumps will be operated by an engine. CONGRESSIONAL SUMMARY.fi Washington, December 11. Kansas will be divided into two federal judi cial districts, if the efforts of Senator Baker has anything to do with it. The prospects for the ratification of the Hawaiian treaty are anything but flattering. The Senate was in session one hour on the 8th.

The county attorney of Ellis county has been instructed to bring an action against all parties who have failed to pay their seed grain notes for seed furnished in 1895. The county treas urer has sent out seven notices to each person since 1895, or about 4,200 in all at an expense to the county of at least $75, for postage, etc., the last notice being sent out just prior to the last harvest. In 1895 and 1896 the county treasurer collected and paid to the state treasurer $940.85. In 1897 to date, the total collected . amounts to but $668.27, leaving yet a balance of Tover $1,900 unpaid. In view of the abundant harvest it was confidently expected that these notes would be paid, as in no case the amount with interest exceeded $5.90, The second annual exhibition of the Southwestern Poultry association will be held in Topeka December 27 to 31. A large number oi entries have al ready been made, and many more are expected before the time for the close of the entries December 26.

Norris was 29 years old and single. Parsons is now connected with the natural gas fields of Kansas, the Par sons Natural Gas company completing the piping of that city. A blow out was given in which thousands of citi zens witnessed the display. Every thing passed off without the slightest mishap and Parsons people will be burning natural gas as fuel. Russell Avery has arrived at Wester ley, R. I., having gone overland all the way from Kansas in a prairie schooner. The start was made Au gust 25. He was alone and came I through St. Joseph, Mo., Springfield, 111., and Columbus, O., across Pennsy- vania, through the lower portion of New York state and across Connecti cut to Westerly. He calculates that he has traveled 2,000 miles. A large number of cattle in Graham county have died from running in corn fields. James Gordon lost four. F. D. Turck lost four.

Judge Foster of the federal court has continued the McNall contempt cas;, argued before him, until the next term of court, which will be held in March Judge Foster announced yesterday that he would decide the case Saturday and ordered both sides to be ready for trial on that day. The continuance is believed to be the result of his partial examination of the case and the con clusion that there is nothing in the in dictment, charging McNall with con tempt. It is believed by many that this is the end of the case, and that it will not be called up again. The opponents of County Attorney J. L. Sheppard of Bourbon county in his effort to enforce the prohibition law in this city today scored another victory when they induced the county commissioners to release irom jail three prominent jointists who had been severely sentenced by Judge Simons as an example to others. They were fined $300 and refused to pay but on the contrary went to jail and start ed their friends to circulating petitions to the board for their release. A re monstrance signed by 1,000 people, mostly women, was filed and the board at first refused to release them but to day the petitions were quietly resur rected and granted.' This action is re garded by the county attorney as an affront to Judge Simons and himself. and as an encouragement to violations The men had been in jail two months. A Herrington man has written to Gov. Leedy negotiating the sale of some jack rabbits. The state has rested its case, and the defense is on in the Sheesley mur der trial for the killing of Daniel Mc Faggart at Independence. One Martin, a sensational religious fake, who has been vlllifying the citi zens of Florence, has been shipped from that town with instructions not to return. Rollo Schofield, of Chapman, was fined $30 in police court for shooting d.uail for market. When caught he had in his possession 665 birds and had been shipping for a month. While playing with a dog the 3-year-old son of Mrs. McGinncss, of Topeka, who is visiting her father, William Jackson, near independence, was probably fatally bitten. The animal's teeth penetrated the boy's eyelids, and probably destroyed the sight. The number of raobit scalps re ceived at the Sumner county clerk's office in one day was 5,000, for which $150 in bounty was paid. The total number of scalps received since the bounty was offered, is 18,000, repre senting a cost to the county of $540 for these pests. Wm. V. Aultman, a farmer living 15 miles west of St. Francis, has been sentenced to the penitentiary f6r one year. Mr. Aultman is the sou of a minister. His crime was the continu ous theft of harness from his neigh bors, which he burned or buried, and never attempted to sell or use. A. H. Davenport, aged 35, of Wan- sau, is., died of hemorrhage of the lungs while in the waiting room of the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Mem phis depot. He was well dressed but had little money. From papers found it was shown that he had traveled all over the country in search of health. Shortly after noon Thursday Dr. Henry H. Deal, one of the leading dentists of Clay Center,, was found dead on the floor of . his office. Upon examination it was found that death was caused by a revolver shot, the bullet having penetrated the heart. The wound was evidently self inflicted. Cottonwood Falls, Dec. 9. Paul Norris, a single man, aged 29 years, was instantly killed on the Santa Fe railroad at a crossing on the Clover Cliff far-, ten miles west of this city. He had driven across the track with, a load of fodder and went back to close gate, when itn. a freight train struck J. H.

The county commissioners of Pratt county have closed a deal with Spitzer & Co., of Toledo, O., for the refunding of $100,000 D. M. & A. bonds, paying them a commission of $3,065 for get- ing in the old bonds. The old bonds were 15-30 6 per cent bonds and the new ones are the same kind, bearing. 4 per cent interest. John E. Gilbert, a Kansas stockman, has brought suit in the common pleas court of Kansas City, Kan., against the Missouri Pacific and Rock Island railroad companies, jointly, to recover $1,799.85 damages. Gilbert charges that the railroads failed to disinfect cattle cars after cattle afflicted with Texas fever had been shipped in them. The state has paid to John A. Klein- hans, to whom the claim was assigned, 9,000 due Judge W. C. Webb for his compilation of the statutes of Kansas. The amount which was appropriated for Mr . Webb was $10,000. The thous and dollars of the amount went to John S. Parks, the state printer, who printed and bound the books. Judge Webb gets $9,000 for the work. There will be a national convention of fish commissioners and others inter ested in that class of work at Tampa, Fla. , January 18. In response to a re quest from the governor of Florida, Governor Leedy, some time ago, ap pointed delegates to represent Kansas. All of them declined to go, but Orrin Nelson, register of deeds of Elk coun ty, has written to the governor saying . he would like to represent the state at the convention. If Mr. Nelson cares to go and pay his own expenses the governor will accord him that privi lege, but the contingent fund is not available for such purposes.
