REDUCE ACREAGE HARVIE JORDAN ISSUES APPEAL TO SOUTHERN FARMERS. LÂW QF SUPPLY AND DEMAND This Constitution, Says Jordan. Only True Medium of Regulating Cotton Prices. Atlanta. Ga.. Dec. 11. -Présider.* Harvie Jordan fir the Southern Cot ton Growers' Association issued a cir cular letter to the farmers of the South yesterday regarding a ledu duction in cotton acreage for 190M. The letter says in part: "The Southern Cotton Growers' As sociation will not ask the farmers of i me South to reduce the cotton acreage for 1900 less than that planted m 1 ;k)7,. The association does ask an insist with all the force at its com mand, however, that the acreage plant ed in cotton throughout the belt in 1905 be not increased during the planting season of 1906. Let. the watchword of every Southern farmer be "Divrsification,' and through that agency produce an abundance of looi supplies to maintain each farm. "The present estimated 27,000,000 acres planted in cotton is sufficient under normal climatic conditions to produce enough cotton to meet the demands of spinners for the Ameri can staple. Any material increase in the cotton acreage for 1906 will tend to stagnate tho depress prices below their legitimate value. The legitimate laws of supply and demand Is the only true medium of regulating fair and legitimate prices for our great staple product." President Jordan closes the letter with a strong appeal to the farmers to plant an abundance of small gram, corn and side crops and urges them to raise more hay, cattle, hogs, etc.. that, the farmers may become more self sustaining. . * .,, >tton market and National Farmers' Union. Texarkana, Texas: The executive committee of the National Farmers' Union did not leave for home until Saturday night, and one of them re mained over until Sunday morning, it is learned now that a meeting of the committee was quietly planned Satur day afternoon, but nothing was done farther than to decide on a meeting of the committee to be held at Dallas oa Jan. 7. At that, meeting plans will oe discussed and adopted for the publica tion of a national newspaper organ. Tho question of a national headquar ters will also be settled, aud from what could be learned the choice of this honor will be between Dallas and Tex arlrana. Other matters of importance to the order will also be taken up and disposed of at the meeting. Bullet Hole in His Breast. Memphis, Tonn.: B. L. Cox, a cloth ing salesman, was found dead on the Fort Pickering road in South Mem phis, with a bullet hole in his breast.

Panama: Guatemala cables that the agent of the Panama ailroad mak ?s the official announcement that he will accept, freight from those countries via that Une from any steamer, thus abol ishing the Pacific Mail monopoly. This will mean a big increase in coastwise trade and German steamers will prob ably go Into the trade, resulting in an increase of Panama Railroad freight and saving of the trip around the Horn. Luke Wright in Washington. Chicago: Governor General Luke T.

HOLD FOR 15c. Cheatham Urges the Southern Cotton Planter to Stand His Ground. ■ (»a. De 1 I .—Richard rotary of the Southern rs' Association, issued to the cotton growers yesterday. in which he hold for cotton. 11 > Atlanta, Cheatham, sc C-otton Cr.w an open lettt ol' tho South urges them i< '.says in pan: -The cotton growers ol' 'he South. ! ,trough and with the assistance of I their organization, the Southern Cot j ton Growers' Association, are slowly I but surely winning the greatest com • mercial battle ever known to the ! world. "On September 7 the association ad | vised the farmers to ask 11c for their « cotton, as c onditions fully warranted Manv fixed that and j that prie ! sold for it. i "Now on December 1 the fact that j the crop is a very short one has been ! established beyond a shadow of a ; doubt, and only a small remnant of j that left unsold, also that the markets I are bare of dry goods, with future • prices formally advanced, cotton mills ! loaded down with contracts and orders for goods for several months ahead and oniy with about one-half enough cotton in sight to fill them. Will they pay 15c for cotton? Why, of course they will, if you ask it. If you do not they will take it. at 5c, as they have done in the past. "Decide for yourselves—let them have it its actual value, 15c, or let them take it at their price, 5c—it 5s yours, do as you please, but remember that if you sell for less than its value, 15c, you are not only injuring your ' self, but every other owner of cotton is being denied his price while you are giving yours away, which pre vents the advance as long as they can get it at less than its value. "Hundreds of thousands of bales aie being pledged to the Southern Cotton Growers' Association for 3 5c, enough to force the price to its value very soon unless buyers can continue to get yours that is not pledged at their price; in this event the price cannot reach its value until yours has been taken out of the way and at their price—then the loyal ones will again reap the benefit of their association's hard work in their behalf." A Kentucky Killing. Lexington, Ky.: In attempting to arrest Jake Noble at Jackson yester day, Grant. Holliday, a deputy sheriff, j was shot and killed. Holliday had a ! warrant charging a misdemeanor and j sought out Noble in the suburbs. It J is no known what words passed be tweeh them, but Holliday shot Noble in tho face with a shotgun.

VP/S2V&T C47&S8£ZZ-u The political crisis in the united kingdom reached a climax Dec. 4, when Arthur J. Balfour, tho premier, formally tendered the resignation of himself and the members of his cabi net, to King Edward, who accepted them. His majesty intrusted Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman with the task of forming a new cabinet. "C.-B." has been leader of the op position since 1899, when Lord Rose bery resigned the position. He dis tinguished himself by his fight on the government's South African pol icy and by his opposition to the war POSTAL REVENUES ARE LARGE. Enormous Increase Shown in Receipts in Recent Years. Mercury the 1 messenger in his my riad personality of the United States postal service has swelled to a gi gantically prosperous race. The pos tal revenues for 1904-05 wen; greater by $10,000,000 than those for 190;!-04. and oui side the rural brauch of the service, which has been vastly ex tended in free deliveries, receipts now balance expenditures. The mon ey order business reached $1,000,01)0, 000, a gain of more than 20 per cent, and 6,000,000,000 more postal cards, stamps, and stamped wrappers were used last year than the year previous. Were it. not for the deficit entailed by the rural free delivery the depart ment could at the present more than pay its way and within the next five or ten years might be in a position to recommend congress some mate rial reduction in postal rates. As a means of education and of national development the rural free delivery has already proved its worth, and as the system grows it will becoggt more and more self-supporting. It™mefits trade by bringing the country into easy communication with the city and increases enlightenment, contentment and comfort in rural districts.—Chi cago Tribune. Making Statistics Attractive. Secretary Wilson knows as well as another that to the average man mere statistics are unattractive and large ly meaningless. When he says that "every sunset during the last five years has registered an increase of $3,400,000 in the value of American farms" the fact sticks. When he states and proves that "the man with the hoe has become the man with the harvester and the depositor and share holder of the bank" he tells a monu mental truth that will bear some dec orative detail, l^et the good work go on. If the purpose of a department report is to tell the people what it is doing for them it should be set forth in terms that can be under standed of the people and remember ed by them. Figures alone will not serve.—Cleveland Plain Dealer. Authors in Collaboration The announcement of the death of the widow of James Rice recalls the notable collaboration between James Rice and Walter Besant. It was like the partnership of Erckmann .and Cha trian. To-day we have the example of the Castles, mother and son, writ ing novels in collaboration, and other modern instances can be cited. An drew Lang said years ago: "As a rule in collaboration one man does the work while the other looks on." Another opinion is that of Dumas, who wrote: "One is always the dupe and he is the man of talent." Those who knew the two men said that it was Jameg Rice who supplied the in genious plots and Walter Besant. who worked out the detail. Deaf Mutes Makers of Telephones. Past masters of at least ote trade are the deaf mutes, who have been found far to excel the ordinary ar tisan in one sort of telephone mak ing. A telephone factory of Chicago, after a series of experiments, discov ered that to the manufacture of the modern telephone and its delicate mechanism the deaf mute, by reason of manual deftness incident to con stant use of the sipn language, is pe culiarly adapted. This factory is now employing at standard wages 150 peo ple without speech or hearing. Provides Labor for Converts. A company has recently been or ganized in Fatehargh, India, "to pro vide remunerative labor for Indian Christians," thus striving te overcome the difficulty of furnishing support for native Christians who have be come outcasts for the sake of gos pel. The company is conducted on the profit -sharing plan, one-fourth of all the profits being divided among those in service for six months or more, in proportion to the size of their wages. with the Boers. He is 69 years oid, was born in Scotland, and has been a member of the house of commons uninterruptedly since 1868. He was financial secretary from 1871. to 1874, and from 188'» to 1882. From 1882 until his party went out in 1885 he was Irish secretary. In 1886, when Gladstone returned to office. Sir Henry was made secretary of war When Gladstone was defeated on the Irish home rule bill Sir Henry went out with the rest. He returned to the war office under Lord Rosebery itt 1892, and remained unril the defeat of the liberals in 1895. He was knighted in 1895. 

CHANGE IN NUMERAL SYSTEM Use of Duodecimals Instead of Deci mals Suggested. Duodecimals instead of decimals are offered from England. A notation founded on twelve instead of ten is believed w have been in use by the Chaldeans, and since twelve is divisi ble by two, three, four, and six, this is manifestly superior to ten, which in divisible only by two and five. It would be necessary to forego the use of the Arabic system of numerals and have eleven new ones and zero before the undoubted advantages of the duodeci mal system could be realized in prac tice. It is argued that there is no necessity of displacing the old nota tion but merely to teach every child the new system also. The extra con venience in calculation would soon leave the Arabic figures stranded as historical curiosities. It is incon ceivable once a man acquires the hab it of reckoning by twelves that he should ever voluntarily return to tens. It ia suggested that, a beginning be made with scientific and technical students, a picked class of intelligent minds which would readily understand the value of a duodecimal notation and not grudge the small amount of trouble necessary for memorizing. Japan Sends Best Sulphur. liook in Japan for good sulphur The yield of sulphur from Japanese ore is probably the highest in the world. It reaches 50 per cent in the north, where ore of less than 38 per cent is rejected. In Sicily 20 per cent ore is considered workable. Japan's output has grown from 10,000 tons in 1900 to above 20,000 tons in 190*, and is likely to grow still further. Domestic consumption takes only a quarter of the output, the consuming industries being the manufacture of matches, for which there are numerous plants, of explosives and of chemi cals. Exports amouht to H.OOO or 15, 000 Ums per year, the western coast of the United States and Australia being the largest consumers. The process of extraction is still primitive and in northern Japan snow inter rupts activities for five months every year. Claiming Victory for Turbines. The advantages claimed for the tur bine justified thus far by experiment are economy in coal consumption smaller engine-room, lessened vibra tion, reduced cost of attendance, over hauling and of oils and stores. The defects heretofore pointed out—tho in efficiency of turbines at low speed and poor reversing and maneuvering qua! ities—are now said to have been over come and the turbinates are asserting a complete victory. It is confidently believed that the time is not far dis tant when, utilizing the saved space for larger turbine batteri(?s, passenger steamers will be propelled at thirty five statute miles an hour, or as fast as the ordinary railway traiu. Career of Richard A. McCurdy. Richard A. McCurdy, who has re signed the presidency of the Mutual Life company, is a lawyer by profes sion. having graduated from Harvard in 1855 with the degree of LL. B. Lat er he practiced law in New York with Lucius Robinson, afterward governor of the state. He first became identl fied with the Mutual in 1860 as its counsel and has been drawing salary from the corporation ever since. A few years ago he built a house in Morrlstown, N. J., which cost about $1,000,000. Modern Inventions for Ships. All of the water-tight doors con necting compartments of the hold ot one of the greatest ocean liners can be closed in a few seconds, from the bridge of the steamer, by simply pressing an elcctric button. Another useful application of science to the protection of passengers is the fitting of the latest type of ocean steamships with apparatus whereby sulphuric acid gas can be forced into a fire iu any part of the vessel. Immediately attar it is discovered. THE 

MAILED HAND ^"ACTION AND REVOLUTION CON FRONT EACH CTHEn. ARMED REVOLUTION PLASHED. Durnovo Claims Irrefutable Proof Agair.st Krustaleff, the Strike Lead cr—Wittc's Ministry To'/:rr. St. I taiîuul rrn nu*; i; ni vor favor » ;n hi 1) thorit it has finally d sal suffrage and jf the old proj wo i knien tension oi payers. irg. De-. 1-. t is ascei .- the gov ■d agains practically I of 'wenty-oi representatives and the e: the ballot to the small rei erehants and the edueat; classes. However, the lav. must till pass the Council of the Empire tin receive imperial approval. The railroad men claim that t hey have been informed thai several sec tions of the southwestern .systems have already t sponded to the appeal for a general strike. Cooler heads, however, are advising against precip itating action which might result in failure and are urging a postponement of action until the organizations throughout the country have been con sulted. It is believed that if the attempt at reaction is persisted in, the Moder ate Liberal.-, who are disgusted with the tactics of the revolutionaries, fear ing anarchy, will surely be driven back into the camp of the extremists. Premier Witte's friends declare em phatically that he has never been in favor of an armed repression, ami they intimate strongly that the arrest of the strike leaders must be charged to Interior Minister Durnovo, who ir< sisted that he had proof, which couid be established In the courts, that M. Krustaleff was planning an armed revolution and that, besides attempt-) ing to subvert the government, he had attacked its credit in circulars advis ing the peasants and workmen to withdraw their funds from the sav ings banks. Notwithstanding this, doubt is expressed as to whether M. Durnovo can establish his ease, a.s the specific law making agitatien for po •litical strikes which interfere, with the railroads, telegraphs, posts, etc., a criminal offense, has not yet been pro mulgated. It is expected, however, that the law will be promulgated be fore the eiwl of the week, when it i> said the government can proceed le gaily against the present agitators. It is understood that Gen. Dedulin. Prefect of St. Petersburg, has refused to carry out Durnovo's orders, that he lias resigned and that 'ho has been. succeeded by Baron de Meyendorff, commander of Emperor Nicholas' bodyguard. A humorous sidelight on t.ho situa tion is the action of the cooks, laun dresses and porters of the asylum for the insane in striking and demanding that the chief physician bo chosen by the equal, direct and secret ballot of the employes. The printers of the Russ, the chief organ of the Liberals, an edition of which was seized last night, have now struck because the proprietor has re fused to pay them for tho- time lost during the strike. The situation is exceedingly omin ous. Public opinion is practically unani mous that the government has entered upon the fatal path of reaction und that Witte's ministry must. fall. Reaction and revolution confront each other in a death struggle. Both. Gen. Trepoff and Gen. Count Ignatieff, according to popular impression, ara being held in reserve to execute, the program of repression, it is again said that, the entire Cossack strength of 400,000 will be mobilized in a su preme effort to crush the revolution ary forces. Gen. Parseneff said: "I think we are coming to rivers of blood hi which the revolutionary party will lose their game and Russia her liberty." Certainly the appearance of street demonstrations yesterday seemed to justify this gloomy picture of the fii ture. The capital resembles a great military camp. The patrols every where were doubled, and grim looking cannon rumbled the streets. What happened smocked strongly of the old regime. A large workmen's meet ing was dispersed by Cossacks. Gonzales, Texas: L.- Martin ship ped one car of calves, and Houston & Boothe one car of cows to New Or leans Friday. Cut Off Postage Bills.
