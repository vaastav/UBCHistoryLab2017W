Not receiving an answer to bis hurried inquiry the youth withdrew hit bead and retired, leaving the Senate in a most decided state of merriment, and the clerk in convulsions. Some of the members turned suddenly about to see where the shrill, small voice came from bat tbe small boy had disappear ed as if the earth had swallowed him. S?-CiPT.

Nobody ever charged Mr. Nolan with brioging about the strike. His (Mr, Jeffera') ?rgQineutiwas<that Mr, Nolan was not pay ing enough for the use of the city's entry to his coal. banks. There wai; no doubt that the coal merchant* were imposing on consumers. Nolan had great*? , advanta ges than &ny> other merchant. He moved that six months be gl?an to Mr. Nolan to va cate the city's entry to bit banka. Mr. Donnel! gave a statement of the conditions of the contract with. Nolan. A Aa a member of the committee be had found notbiog to justify the city in giving Nolan notice to quit, besides neither the city or coal consumers woald reap any benefit from it. Mr. Hughea said that Nolao, by the privileges which he enjoyed under the con tract with the city, coritrdlled the coal iraidej and that he bad boasted to other merchants that be conld.and. would do it. He nad free access to bis banks from the other side ot the bill without the nse of the city's entry. , The report of the committee was adop ted. The committee appointed to report opon the matter of the distribution of coal to the poor, recommended that one member of Council from each ward be appointed to give out coal to the deaerring poor and that'the committed on Water Works have control of the system. Qp motion it was resolved that the Com mittee on Water Works, including the Su perintendent of the Works and the Collec tor Of the water Tents, be appointed to dis tiibute coal to the poor. Also that the City , Clerk be retjuired to procure blank orders for the use of said committee. On motion two fines, amounting to $20, imposed upon Alexander Bowman, for Bell ing liquor to soldiera were refunded.f It appeared from the evidence before the com mittee that Bowman refused to sell liquor to certain soldiers, who, out of.spite, pre-, ferred a false charge against him and sus tained it by false oaths. The license 5>f , John Booker to keep a coffee house was transferred to Augustus Rolf. .6 ::xru .fct On motion of Mr. Blair the matter of the purchase of certain coal belonging to Jph Nolan was referred to the committee o coal banks. i On motion of Mr. Uildreth the Council | adjotfrned.

M. j Between 4 and 6 o'clock this morning ttie fpontoon train in charge of the 17th And 30th N. Y. engineer! under commend of Ge^."Wo0dbar/jpropeedtd to the river bask whete with ju (fen try Support where attempt was made to throw 3 bridges across the river. The dull haze so obsenred the more* ment that for a time it was not discovered by the rebel pickets. Pontooniers had suc ceeded] in partially constructing bridges when the rebels suddenly opened * brisk and deadly fire musketry from along the banks of the river and windows of houses compelling cessation of works. Returning to cover vt the surrounding hills the men agaipe formed, and about 6 o'elock an at tempt'was renrwed but the rebels had now been thoroughly aroused and with rein forcements of sharpshooters swarmed to the opposite banks and honses. Nothing daunted by the hot fire which they poured in at the reappearance of our troops. The pontooniers went gallantly to work but in vain. A storm of ballets enveloped them. Planks and boats were riddled by every volley. Once more they were compelled to withdraw and fell back to cover of the ridge , hill# and running parallel with the 'river. It was evident the rebels determined to use the bouses of the city Tor a defence contrary to an implied agree ment. In a correspondence wihch recently passed by flag of truce orders were given to our artillerymen to open fire upon the city, accordingly Benjamin's, Edward's, Muhlenburg's and other batteries of the 9th corps together with other batteries of corps to the right and left of the city com menced on almost simultaneous bombard ment. The fog was so dense that it was impossible to see but a short distance be yood the edge of the river, the houses, however,1 In which the rebel sharpshooters had esconsed themselves were plainly, visi ble, and to them lire for a time was par ticularly directed, the effect was their par tial demolition in a short time. After the first fire they became untenable by rebel riflemen, who retreated to the rear of the town where they took shelter, behind as vet, unharmed buildings. By 7 o'clock the bombardmentbecame general and from that until 1 o'e|ock the roar of artillety was in cessant. The batteries ot the Oth raked the streets with shell, shrapnel and grape, though the fog still continued to obscure in a measure the results of these dischar ges. The rebels with the greatest stub borness still kept within the city, and at times partiosof them could be seen going from one point to another on double quick. The carnage cannot but be fearful amongst them. It is somewhat singular that the rebel batteries did not return the fire of our guns, lip to the preseut time they liave not opened. About 10 o'clock the engineers formed 'or the third attempt to construct bridges, lifter previous ineffectual attempts on the part of the engineers to cross a party of 80 men of the 8th Connecticut under Captain Marsh, volunteered to assist in this new mdeavor to finish the bridge, and once nore the column with this reinforcement itnrted under the direction of General Woodbury. They seised planks and serried out some doxen to the end of the string of boats and placed a part of them and were then compelled to retire under a very galling fire from the rebel sharpshooters, who were ensconsed tecurely in rifle pits below the range of artillery and within 15 or 20 feet of the river edge. The. Engiueers suffered se verely. The movements having been thus interrupted the whole party were ordered back to their regular position. At eleven Vcluck it was discovered that one of the houses was on fire. The lUmes which com menced in a westerly part of the city, soon spread and Fredcricksburg Is now envel oped in fire and smoke. An enfilading fire has been opened upon the rebel rifle pits up the river. It has been successful so far in driving the sharp shooters from the vicinity of the Railroad Depot. The Engineers are now constrncting bridges across the river. The rebels still maintain their grouud opposite the upper bridges. Cavalry are now passing Gen. Sumner's headquarters cn route to make a charge across the river at one of the fords. N?w York, Dec. 12.? The special Wash ington correspondent to the Philadelphia Press dated yesterday states private dis patches received to night from Fredericks burg say the .greater part of Franklin's division crossed safely, throwing out pick" ets to thope of Hooker's at Fredericksburg. The pickets advancing towards the ene my's operations The city is on fire but it is thought most of the buildings would be. sa,ved. The enemy skirmiebing till day with onr advance, but gradually falling back. Our losses are insignificant as far as known. General Parke telegraphed we are in full possession of Fredericksburg to>nigbt and our troops are crossing the river rapidly.

Message of the Governor of Horth Carolina. N'ivrku, N. C., Dec. 8.?By mail, the Message of Oor. Vance, of N. O., to the General Assemblj, dated Not. 17th, has been received; It is very lengthy and be trays nothing like Union sentiments, but appeals to that stern and determined devo tion to our cause which can alone sastaia a revolution. He reflects severely upon the conscript Uw and bitterly denounces the spirit of speculation and extortion per vading the State. He says flour can now be used only by the rich and everything bss a'tendency upward.^The pleuteousness of money and the high price of property, he alleges as a reason why men should be made Mr pay their debts. The North Car olina soldiers, be says, are still suffering greatly for want of shoes and clothing.? The present debt of the State is $20,983, 361. Be says that there is great danger of the lawless overrunning the land, and that the people are beginning to forget that there is such a thing as oisil law and alludes to the violent and law defying ten dencies of \tlie times t^nd to the frequency of murder, arson, disregard of obligations, oppression and injustice. Referring to the confinement in Sauls bury by the Confederate authorities of North Carolina, arrested for alleged politi cal offenses, he says what their guilt con sists of he does not know, but he does know that they were not Arrested by law ful process. He strongly denounces the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus, the power of which he says he learns from newspapers. Congress has conferred upon the President, and says that be in unwilling to see such powers entrusted to any living mau. He objects to the distillation of grain, and the diversion of the school fund to war purposes, and conoludes by urging upon the Legislatures the vital importance of bring ing forth all the powers and resources of the State for the common defense of onr country and our cause. The Raleigh Standard says: A gentle man of this StHte who lately escaped from the Yankee lines, informs us that while North he understood that the collection of forces at Suffolk and Newborn by the ene my was designed to advance upon Weldon, Qoldsboro and Raleigh. He. also says the taking of Wilmington is in the programme. It appears that Union and Free Labor meetings have been held ib this city and elsewhere for many weeks. There was a great free labor demonstration at Beaufort a few days ago, creating m profound sensa tion in the Department aud throughout the State. An organization of this movement is qnietly progressing and enlisting large uumber8 of adherents. Information has been received at head quarters which discloses the fact that a powerful reaction against the war is pro gressingiin the interior. Letters from all classes of people, intercepted by the cap tore of rebel mails, indicate a universal prayer for peace. Occupation of Fredericksburg?A Great Battle Impending? Rebels Fortified.
