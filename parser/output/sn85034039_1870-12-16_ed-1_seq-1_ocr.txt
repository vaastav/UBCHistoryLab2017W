I rcirret to sav tho that no conclusion has boon rcachod for tho adjustment of tho claims ngalnst Great lirltaln grow ing out of tho courso adoptod by that Government during the rebellion. Tho cabinet at London, so far as its vlows havo been expressed, docs not appear to bo willing to couccdo that hor Majesty's Government was guilty of negligence, or did, or permitted any act during tho war, uy which ino uuiicu states nas tist cause of complaint, but her linn, and nsthcuuatlcrahlo convictions arc di rectly tho rovcrsc, I, therefore, recom mend to Congiess to authorize Ilia up pointmcnt of a committee to tako a proof of the ntnnunls, the ownership and their claim', and to give notice to tho representative or Her .Majesty, at Washington, and that niithnrlly bo given for tho settlement of these claims by tho United States, so that tho government shall havo tho ownernhlp of ptivoto claims as well as tho rcipomlblo control of all doin.inds against Great Itrltain. It canno. ho ncctssary to add, mat whenever Her Majesty's government shall entertain n desiro for n full mid friendly adjustment or llicso claims, tho United StatoB will enter upon llicir con siderations with an earnest deslro for n conclusion with honor and dignity to both nntions. Tlio course pursued bv the Canadian authorities towards the llshcrtncti of tho United States during tlio past tctwon, has not been morked by n friendly feel ing. Ity the first artlclo of tho conven tion of 1818, between (.rent Ilritaln and tlio United StBtes, It was agreed that the Inhabitants of tlio United States should havo forever, In common with British sub ccts. tho light taking tlsh In certain waters Unrein defined. In the wators not included in tlio limits named in tho convention, within thrco miles of parts of the llrltlsh const, It has been iuu custom. lor manv venm, to gnu in tHiillnir fishermen of the United States a reasounblo warning of tho violation of the technical rights oi ureal iiriiniu. Tho Imperial government Is understood to have dclegnled Iho whole or a shara of Its jurIdictloii or control of thoso In shore fishing L'l'oiinds to tho Colonial authorities, known ns tnn wniiiininu oi Canada, and '.his soiiii-iiidcpcndent but Irresponsible agent has exorcised its de legated power lu unfrloiully ways. Vessels havo been seized without notice warning, in violation of tho custom nrevlnnslv prevailing, and havo been taken into Colonial ports, their voyages lirnucn up, mid tlio vessels concimuntu mere is reason to ticnovo that tins uu friendly and vexatious treatment was designed to bear harshly upon tho hardy shcrnien o tho l lilted males, wild a view of polltital effect upon this govern ment.

If such a ves sel Is found preparing to fish within three marine mllo of any such coasts, bays, creeks for harbors, without a li cense, or nftor tho expiration of tho pe rlop named in tho last liccn'o granted o It, they provide that thu vessel, with her tackle, &c.,&c., shall ho forfeited. It is not known that any condemnations been mado under this statute, Should tho authorities of Canada attempt to enforco It, it will bocomo my duty to take such steps as mav bn necessary to protect tho rights of the citizens of tho United States. It has bcon claimed by Her Mttjesty'j ofllcors that the fishing vosscU of the United States have no right to cuter tlio open ports of tlio British Possessions of North America, oxcent for tho purposo of shelter and repairing damages, of purchasing wood and obtaining water; that thoy havo no right to enter nt tho British custom houso!, or to trade, ex cept in tho purcliaso of wood and wntor; and that they must depart within twen-ty-four hours after notlco to leave. It Is not known that any seizuro of a fishing vcbscI carrying tin flag of tho United Statos has bcon mado lindor thin claim. So far as tho claim Is founded on alleged construction of tho convention of 1818, It cannot be acquiesced In by tho Uni ted States. It Is hoped Hint it will not bo luslstod upon by Her Majesty's gov eminent. During the conferences which preceded tho ncgotlnfion ot the coven tlon of 1818, tho Brltlili commissioners proposed to expressly cxcludo tho fisher men of tho United Stnts from tho piivl- jego of carrying on trado with any of His BritanioMnjesty's snblcctB residing within tho limit" Assigned for their me, and alsthat It should not bo lawful for tha.'Vfsels of tho United States, engaged l'Such fishery, to havo onboard any (goods, wares or merchandise whatover, exaopi siicu ns may oc nucDsinry im mu nrniinpiitlan of their vovnges to mid from said fishing grounds, anil any vobscI of tho united states which biiuii coniru, vone this regulation may bo seized, con, lntmieil nml confiscated with her cargo This proposition, which Is Identical with the construction now put upon n,i l an mi mm nf the Convention, was Vnpliaticaliy ticgaiivou ny uio .min oav Commissioner, and thereupon was nitiiniiniinii iiv ino lirmsn iiriiisu rioui- potentlarlos, and artlclo 1. as It stands In tho Convention, was substituted.

A like unfriendly disposition has been manifested on tlio part of Canada in tlio maintenance of it claim of tho right to exclude, the cltizcni of tlio United States from the navigation of the St. Law rence. This l iver constitutes a natural outlet to tho ocean furcightStatcs, witli nn nggreg.ito population of 17,(500,000 In habitants, ami with nil aggregate tonago of GtfI,5C7 tons upon thu wators which discharge into It. The foreign commerce of their porlx, on tbeso waters, Is open to British competition, and tho major part of it is dono in llrilish bottoms. If American eainen aro excluded from this natural avenue to tho ocean, tho monopoly of thu direct coiumsrco of tlio lako purls with tho Atlantic would bo lu foreign hands, their vessels on traus Atlautlc voyages having an access to our lako ports, which would bo denied to American vessels on similar voyages. To stato such appropriation, is tu ictuto Its justice. During tlio administration of Mr, John Oiiliicv Adams. Mr. Clav unmics- tlounblv demonstrated the natural light of the citizens of the United Statu to tho navigation of this river, claiming tho act of Congress of Vienna In opening of tho KIIIIIC. Illlll pllior rivora nil imuini", showed tho Judgment of European Ju rists ami statesmen, mat tiioiuiiaiiitanttj ol a country through which a uavigablo river passes, havo u natural right to en- oy the navigation or that river to mid uto tho sea, oven though passing thro' the territory of another power. This right does not exclude thoco-cqunl right of tho sovereign possessing tho territo ry through which mo river dobnuclics into tho sea to mnko, such regulations relaltvo to tlio policy of the negotiation ns may ho reasonably necessary, but thoso negotiations should be framed in a libera! spirit of comity, and should not impnso need, ess niirdcns upon tuo coiiimorco wlilrJi has tho right of trans it. It has beli. in practice, mora ad- antagenus IJ arrange these negotiations by mutual agreement. Thu United States aio ready to mako any reasonable arrangements as to Iho practical use of mo si. i.awrcnco which may no sugges ted by Great Britain. If the claim mado by Mr. Clay was Just when tho popula tion of tlio States bordering on tho shores of tlio lakes was only 8,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from tho increased population, wealth. production and tonnago of tho States on tlio Canadian ironticr. Since Mr. Clny advanced his argument on behalf ot our rights, the prlnclplo for which lie contended has been frequently and by various nations recognized by law or uy treaty, ami nas uecu cxicmicu to Bovcrnl othor great rivers. By tho treaty concluded nt Maycnce, in 1831, the uiuno was ueciareu irec irom tuo point whoro It was uavigablo to tha sea.

Tlio greatest living llrltlsh authority on this subject, while asserting the ab stract right of tho British claims, says It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her rofusal upon strict law, bill It is equally difficult to deny, first, that In so doing, she oxer clsos harshly an extreme and hard law ; secondly, that her conduct with respect to tlio navigation of tho St. I.awroiico Is a glaring and discreditable Inconsisten cy with her conduct with respect to tho navigation of tlio Mississippi, On the ground that sho possessed a small domain In which tho Mississippi takes its rlso, sho Insisted on tho right to nav igato tho entire volume of Its wntor. On tho ground that sho possessed both banks of the St. I.awrcnco wlicro It disem bogues Itsolf into tlio soa, sho denies to tlio United States tho right of naviga tion through about one-half of tho wat ers of lakes Ontario.

Our depressed commcrco is a sabjeel to which I callod your attontlon at tho last session. I suggested that wo will lu future have to look mora to eoltiTtrles lonth of us, and to China and Japan for Its revival. Our representatives to all these governments havo exerted their Influenco to encourago trado botweon tho United Stales and tho countries to which thoy aro accredited : but tho fact exists that the carrying Is done almost entirely in foreign vessels, and while this stato of affairs exists wo cannot con trol our duo sharo of Iho commerce of tho world. That between tho Pacific States and China and Japan, is about all the carrying frndo now conducted in American vessels. I would recommend n liberal policy towards that lino of American steamers ; one that will In sure Its success and oven Increased use fullness. The cost of building Iron ves- lscls, tho only ones that can compcto with rorclsu shins In Iho carrying trade. Is to much greater In Iho United Statos than III forolgu countries, thnL without somo assistance from the government they cannot bo successfully built hero. Thcro will be scvcrnl propositions laid beforo Congress In tho courso of tho pre sent scsilon, looking to it remedy for Ihls evil, oven II It should no at somo cost to tho national treasury. I hope such encouragement will bn given as will secure Amorirnu shipping on tlio high seas, and American ship building at homes. BTATH AllCIIIVKd. Tho condition of the archives at tho Department of Stat calls for tho early action of Congress. Tha building now occupied by that dopnrtmcut Is a frail structure, at an inconvenient distnuco from the oxcciltlvo mansion, and from tho other departments. It Is 111 adapted to Iho purposo for which It Ih used, has not capacity to accommodate tho ar chives, anil Is not fire-proof. Its rcmoto situation, its slight contriiciioii, nun l no absence ni n supply oi water in ino neighborhood leaves but llttlo liopo for tho safety ot cither tho building or Its contents in case of tlio accident of a fire. Its destruction won d Involve the loss of tho rolls containing tho original ucts and resolutions ol congress ; ni ino His tory and records ol t he Kovoliitiou, and of tho Confederation ; of tho whole fcrlos of diplomatic and consular nrchives sinco the adoption of the Constitution, and of the many other valtiablo records and iinnnrs lei t with that department when it was tho principal depository of government archives, l recommend t no appropriation oi an amount nf money for the construction of a building for tho Department of Stato. CHANCIER IN JIEI'AIITMKNTS I recommend to your reconsideration tho propriety of'transferrlng to tho De partment of'tho Interior, to which thoy seem more appropriately 10 uuiuhk, ui niiwor nu.l duties relating to tho tcl'I'l loi'!o, with willed tho Department of Stato Is now charged bylaw, orusuago; and rrom tho interior Department to tho War Department tlio Tension Ilu rciiu, so rar as It regulates mo payment of soldiers' pensions. I would further recommend that tho payment of naval pensions bo transferred to one ol tlio bureaus of tlio Navy Department. ESTIMATES OV EXPENSES.

The avcriigo valuoof gold as compar ed with national currency for tho wholo of the year 18U9 was about 1.94, ami ror tho eleven mouths of 1870 tha samo re la. tlvo value lias been about 1.10. Tho ap proach to a snecio basis Is very gratify ing, but the fact cannot bo denied that tiio instability of tho valuo of our cur renrv Is prejudicial to our prosperity. and tends to kcop up prices to tlio det riment oi trade, inooviis oi depre ciated and fluctuating currency aro so groat that now when tho premium on gold has fallen so much, It would scorn mat ms iiino nas arrived wuon, uy win and prudent legislation, Congress should look to a policy which would placo our currency at par with gold nt uo distant day. HEUUCTI0N OF TAXATION. Tho lax collcclod from tuo pcopio has beca red u cod moro than eighty million dollars por annum, and by steadiness in our prosout courso thcro Is no reason why In a few short years tho national tax gatlicror may not disappear from tho door of tho clllzcns nlmost entirely. Willi tho roventio stamps dispensed by postmasters In every community; a tax upon liquors of all BorU and tobacco In all Its forms, and by a wlso adjustment of tho tariff which will put a duty only upon thoso articles which wo could ills penso with, known as luxurios, and on thoso which wo mo moro of than wo produco, rovenuo enough tuny be raised after a faw years of peaco and careful reduction of Indebtedness, to fulfill all our obligations. A further reduction of expenses, In addition to a reduction of tlio Interest account, may bo relied on to mako this pracllblc. itovcnuo rctorm, If It means this, has my early support. If It Implies a collection of all the rev ontio for the support of tho government, for tho payment of principal and Inter est of tho publto debt, pensions, Sc., by directly taxing tlio people, then lam against revenue reform, and confidently bcllovo tho peopio ore with me. If It means failure to provide tho necessary means to defray all tho expenses of tho government, and thereby repudiation of tho public dent ami pensions, men I am still moro opposod to such kind of rove nuo reform. Itovcnuo reform has not been defined by nny of its advocates to my knowledge, but soems to bo accept ed as something which is losuppiy evory man's wants without any cost or effort on his pari. A truo revenue reform can not be mado In a day, but must bo the work of national legislation aud of tlmo, As loon as tho rovenuo can bo dlepons eC with, all dutlos should bo removed from coffoo, tea, and othor articles uni versal uso not produced by ourselves, Tho necessities of tho country compel us to collect rovenuo from our Imports, An nrmy of assessors and collectors Is not a pleasant sight to tho citizens; but to avoid that, a tariff, forrevenue neces sary.

HEIIUCTION OF TUB AHMY. Undor tho act ofCongres of tho loth day of July. 1870, tho army has gradual ly been reduced so that on tho 1st of January, 1871, tho number of commis sioned officers and men will not exceed tho number contemplated by law. WAlt UEl'A HTM KNT 1IUII.DINU. Tho War Department building is au old structliro, not fire-proof and entire ly Inadequate lu dlmcnilons to our pres ent wants. Many thousand of dollars aro now paid annually for rent of pri vate buildings to accommodato tho va rious bureaus of tho department. I rec ommend mi appropriation for a new wnr department building suited to tho present growing wants of the nation. Tho report of tlio Secrotary of War shows a very satisfactory reduction In tlio expenses of tho army for tho last fiscal year. For details you aro refor- roa to uis accompanying icpuri. TUB 

NAVY. Tho expenses of tho Navy for tho wholo of tlio last year, from December 1, 1869, the dtc of tlio last report, aro less thnti ifl8,000,000 or about $1,000,000 loss man nicy wcro tho previous year. Tho expenses sinco the commencement of this fiscal year, sinco July 1st, shows for the live months a decrcaso of $2,400, 000 from thoso of the corresponding months of last year. Tlio estimates Tor tha current yearn re $28,205,070 05, thoso ror tho next year aro i.u,ua,i4U w, with $9,510,000 additional for necessary and permanent Improvements. Thoso estimates nro mado closely for the Micro maintenance of Hip naval establishment as it now is without much in tho naluro of permanent Improvements. The ap propriations made lor ino iat nnti cur rent years wcro ovldcntly Intcdcd by Congress, and nro sufficient only to keep tho Navy on Its present footing by tho repairing and refitting of our old ships. This policy' must of courso grad ually but surely destroy tho Navy, and it is In itself far from economical, as each year that It Is pursued, tho neces sity lor mcro repairs on Biupa in navy yards becomes more Imporatlvo and mure costly nun our current expenses aro annually increased for tlio moro re pair of ships, many of which must soon become unseaworthy mid useless. I hope, during tho present session of Con gress, to bo able to submit a plan by which naval vcsscih can uo uuui uuu i im pairs mado with great saving upon tha iirecut cost. It can hardly ho wlso statcsminshlp In a government which represents a country wun over nny mou sand miles of const line on both oceans, cxcluslvo of Alaska, and containing; forty millions of progressive people, with relations of every nature, with al most every foreign country, to rest with such Inadequate means of enforcing any foreign policy, cither of protection or redress. Separated by tho ocean from tho nations of eastern continent, our na vy Is our only means of direct protec tion to our citizens abroad or for tho enforcement of any foreign policy. I'OHTOFFICi: 

DEI'AIITMENT. Tho accompanying- report of tlio Post master General sIiowh a most satisfac tory working of this department. With tho' adoption of the recommendations contained therein, particularly thoso ro tating to a reform In tho franking privi lege, and the adoption of a correspond ent card, a self-sustaining postal system may bo looked for at uo distant day, and a further reduction of tlio rato of post ago will soon bo nltaliiod. I recommend tho authorization by Congress to tho Postmaster Goneral aud Attorney General to Issuo all commis sions to officials nppoluted through their rcspoctivo departments. These commis sions, when appointments aro Presiden tial, aro issued by tho Stato Depart ment. Thu law lu all tho departments of tho government, except thoso of tho Postulllo and of Justice, authorizes each to Issuo Its own commissions, which always proves a practical reform. 

CIVIL 6EKVICE HEFOI1M. Always favoring practical reform, I respectfully call your attention to ono abuse of long standing which I would llko to sco remedies by this Congress. It Is a reform In tho civil scrvico of tho country. I would adylso that It go be yond tho mcro fixing of tho tenure of of llco of clorkn and omploycs who do not require tho advlco and consent of tho Scuato to mako theso appointments complete. I would have it govern not tho tcnuro but tho manner of making all appointments. There is no duty which so much em barrasses tho Executive and heads of dcpaitmcnts as that of appointments, nor Is thoro any such arduous and thank less labor Imposed on Senatore and Hop rcsoiitatlvcs as that of finding places for constituents. Tlio present system does not sccui'O tlio belt, and olton not even lit men for public places. Tho clova tion and purification of tho civil scrvico of the government will be hailed with approval by tho whole peopio of tho United States. 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Deform In tho management of Indian affairs has received the special attention of the administration from Its Inaugur ation to tho present day. Tho experi ment of making It a missionary work was tried with a few asoncles given to tlio denomination of Friends, and lias been found to work most advantage ously. All ageuclos and superintended clcs, not so disposed of, wero given to officers of tho army. Tho act of Con gress regulating tho army renders army officers ineligible for civil positions, and Indian agonclcs bolng civil offices, I de termined to glvo all tho agonclcs to such religious denominations as had heretofore established missionaries among tho Indians, and perhaps to somo othor denominations who would tinder tako tho work on the samo terms, '. e,, ns missionary work. The societies solccted are allowed to namo their own agents, subject to tho approval of tho Executive, aud aro ex pected to watch over them and aid them as missionaries, to christianize and civ illzo tho Indian, and to train him In tho arts of peace. Tho government watches over tho official acts of theso agents, and requires of them as strict an accounta bility as If thoy wore appointed In any other manner.! entertain tho hope that tho policies now pursued, will, In a fow years, bring all Indians upon reserva tions where thoy Will livo in houses, have school houses and churches, will be pursuing peaceful aud self-sustaining avocations, and where tbey may be as sisted by tho law-abiding white nan, with tho samo Impunity that he now visits tho civilized white settlements. I call your special attention to thejro port of the Commlsloner of Indian Af faire for full Information on this subject. Tin: I'um.ia domain. During tho last fiscal year 8,096,413
