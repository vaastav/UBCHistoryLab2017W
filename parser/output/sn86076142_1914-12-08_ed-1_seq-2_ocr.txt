It is commonplace to a degree, omitting many features which would interest the people of this country and expatiating on a lot of theories that com mand scarcely any attention from citizens at large Throughout the mes sage there is not an inkling of the truth concerning Mexico. There is neither apology nor explanation. No reason u assigned lor the occupation of Vera Cruz and citizens are left to conjecture if the military measure was not simply a demonstration of the efficiency of the American soldier as a scavenger. When the heaps ol garbage thai polluted the air ol the south ern gulf were removed and the town thoroughly disinfected, the troops were called home and Vera Cruz turned back to a lot of irresponsible revo lutionists whose chief occupation is the violation of defenceless women and the ruthless assassination of foreigners. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the American flag hax never been saluted, although 10,000 troops and an armada of battleships were paraded with the ostensible object of whip ping recalcitrant Mexico into subjection. Mexico remains obdurate Presi dent Wilson's message is eloquently silent on these points. On the matter of extending trade relations to the southern continent the president indulges In the sophistry that Iat in America needs our manu factures and cannot get along without them He takes the selfish view that the Spanish speaking people of South America are chiefly interesting to North Americans as consumers of commodiiies produced in this country. It might have come with better fitness had (he president suggested the cultivation of relations with South America by establishing a reciprocal trade and building up mutual interests The burden of the president's lamentation is directed at the decadence of the merchant marine, which he mourns as one of the lost treasures ot the nation. He frankly admits the fallacy of the several suggestions offered for regenerating the merchant marine by saying congress has erred Again he criticises others when the fault lies at the door of the present administra tion, which has done more than all previous administrations to check invest ment of capital in steamships flying the American flag. It was the Wilson administration that raised the cry of "The Steamship Ixibby" when it was proposed to admit foreign built vessels to American register with coasting privileges It was also the Wilson administration which shifted responsi bility to "The Steamship Trust" on the other side of the fence when con gress was occupied with the question of free tolls for vessels Hying the American flag. This preferential consideration was fought by the Uemo crata and defeated at the behest of Great llritain, notwithstanding the fact that Great Britain subsidizes British bottoms and therefore pays those Teasels engaged In the interoceanic trade a greater bonus than the remission of tolls to American vessels would amount to. The war in Europe is treated from a psyc hological standpoint as affect ing the American people and we are told not to grow hysterical over the debility of the army and navy, which are said to be strong enough with the aid of a rehabilitated national guard to meet all hostile demonstrations from abroad. No matter in what way the message is regarded it is a grave disappointment I Vf laoae ieie THE HAGl'E.
