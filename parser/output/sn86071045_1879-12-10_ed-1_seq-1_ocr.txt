HAYES TO CONGRESS. THE MESSAGE. The President's message is a long document, much of which is of no par ticular public interest. The principal topics treated of by the President are the financial operations of the fiscal year, the reform of the civil service, the suppression of polygamy, the fisheries and the Indian policy of Secretary Schurz. The President congratulates Con gress on the successful execution of the resumption act. Since the lst + of January United States notes have been redeemed in coin, but the demand has been comparatively small, and tU? voluntary deposit of coin and in exchange for notes has been vtry large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is about $40,000,000. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a very great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing for eign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold from the Ist of July last to N'ovemlwr 15th, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie pay ments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of tho public credit. The bonds of the Gov ernment, bearing only 4 per cent, in terest, have sold at or ab ive par, suf ficient in amount to pay off all the Na tional debt which was redeemable un der present laws. The amount of in terest saved annually by the process of refunding the debt since March Ist, 1877, is $ 14,207,177. Tho amount of the National debt which matures within less than two years is $792,- 121,700, of which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., aud the balance is in bonds bearing 6 per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of 4 per cent, bonds, and by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected about $11,000,000 can lie annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States f.irthcr legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session. 

SILVER COINAUE. The coinage of gold by the Mints of the United States during the last fiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of silver dollars since the pas sage of the act for that purpose, up to November Ist, 1879, was $45,000,850, of which $12,700,344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the possession of the Government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial Nations of Europe, to effect a perma nent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legis lation on tho general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming year, its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempting further experimental measures with tho coinage. 1 would, however, strongly urge upon Congress the im portance of authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the silver dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dol lar, it is obviously impracticable to maintain theni at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circula tion, it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole standard of value and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent v&lue, dollar for dollar, with the uni versally recognized money of the world. RETIRING UNITED STATES NOTES. The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with tho capac ity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress toward a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war, with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals, was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money for any protracted period of time after the accomplish ment of this purpose was not contem plated by the framcrs of the law un der which they were issued. They j anticipated the redemption and with- > drawal of these notes at the earliest | practicable period consistent with the attainment of the object for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Constitution, hus been to avoid the creation of a National debt, and when from neces sity, in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid oil' on the return of peace as rapidly as pos sible. With this view and for this purpose it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has showed that a d uty can be placed on tea and coffee which will not enhance the price of those articles to tho consumer and which will add several millions of dollars auuually to tho Treasury. TIIE sfrPRESSKW OF POLYGAMY. The President calls attrition to po lygamy in tltab, a'nd says the law for i ts suppression has been decided by the Supreme to be within the legislative pow<?r of Congress, and ,bindings am a rule of action, for all who residedwithin the Territories. There is no longer any reason-for delay or hesitation, in its enforcement.* It shall be firmly anu effectively exectfted. If not sufficiently stringent in its pro visions it should be amended,#nd, in aid of in view, I recom mend fhat more "comprehensive and more 'searching methods faf preveut igg, as well as punishing, tfcis crime Wi provided. * "*• * The President savsr-that the. elec tions of the past year. tWooffi occtfpfro only with State offices, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which attended them all over the coun try, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country towards a more general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom, in the exercise of the elective franchise. He appeals to the intelligence and pa triotism of all good citizens, of every part of the country, however much they may be divided in opinions on other political subject?, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. He urges Congress to sup ply any defects in these laws which experience has shown, and which it is within its power to remedy, and in vokes the co-operation of the Execu tive and legislative authorities of the States in this great purpose. The subject of civil service reform is next discussed, but the President has nothing new to say. He speaks of the gravo evils and perils of a par tisan-spoils system, and goes over the same ground as in his message last year. He also recommends that Con gress makes the necessary appropria tion fur the resumption of the work of the Civil Service Commission. He is convinced that if a just and definite test of merit is enforced for admission to the public service and in making promotions, such abuses as removal without good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper ex ercise of the appointing power, will, in large measure, disappear. THE FISHERIES. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled ques tions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fishermen. The United States Minister in London has been instructed to present a demand for $105,<505.02, in view of the dam ages received by American citizens at Fortune Hay on the 6th day of Janu ary, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British Gov ernment, and an early reply is antici pated. Upon the completion of the necessary preliminary examination the subject of our participation in the pro vincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government, with a view to an early and permanent settle ment of tho whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the ex portation of cattle to the United King dom. THE ISTHMUS CANAL. Diplomatic intercourse with Colom bia is again fully restored by the ar rival of a Minister from that country to the United States. This is especi ally fortunate, in view of the fact that the question of an interoceanic canal has recently assumed a new and im portant aspect and is now under dis cussion with tho Central American countries, through whoso territory the canal by the Nicaragua route would have to pass. It is trusted that en lightened statesmanship on their part will see that the early prosecution of such a work will largely enure to the benefit, not only of their own citizens and those of tin; United States, but of the commerce of the civilized world. It is not doubted that, should the work be undertaken under the pro tective auspices of the United States and upon satisfactory concessions for the right of way and its security by the Central American Governments, the capital for its completion would readily be furnished from this country and Europe which might, failing such guarantees, prove inaccessible. The portion of the message devoted to the army and navy is a mere sum mary of the reports of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy. The busi ness of the Supreme Court, the Presi dent says, is at present largely in ar rears. In the Courts of many of the circuits, also, the business has increased to such an extent that the delay of justice will call the attention of Con gress to an appropriate remedy. The remedy suggested by the Attorney General is the appointment of addi tional Circuit Judges ami the creation of an Intermediate Court of Errors and Appeals which shall relieve the Supreme Court of a part of its juris diction. The President next gives the figures published in the report of the Postmaster General an<l then takes up the report of Secretary Schurz. THE INDIANS. The Indian policy sketched in the report is endorsed. Its object, which is to make liberal provision for the ed ucation of Indian youth, to settle the Indians upon farm lots in severalty, to give them title in fee to their farms, inalienable for a certain number of : years, and when their wants are thus provided for to dispose by sale of the lands on their reservations not occu pied and used by them, a fund to be formed out of the proceeds for the ben | efit of the Indians, which will gradu ally relieve the Government of the ex penses now provided for by annual ap propriations, must commend itself as just and beneficial to the Indians, and as also calculated to remove those ob structions which the existence of large reservations presents to the settlement I and development of tho country. I therefore earnestly recommend the enactment of a law enabling the Gov ernment to give Indians a title iu fee, inalienable for twenty-five years, to the farm lands assigned to them by allot ment. I also repeat the recommenda tion made in my first annual message, that h law be passed admitting Indians who can give satisfactory proof of having by their own labor supported their families for a number of years, and who are willing to detach them selves from their tribal relations, to the benefit of the Homestead act, and to patents containing the samel^rovision of inalienability for a certain period. The President an nounces his intention of protecting the the Indian Territory, but as settlors work their way in the diffi culties will increase, and he approves of the advice given the Indians on a recent occasion, to divide among them selves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual titles in fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what man ner the balance of their lands may be disposed of by the Government for their benefit. The message concludes with urging a generous policy toward the District of Columbia. 110 W 

TIIE PENNS YL VA NIA RAILROAD IS INSPECTED. The annual inspection of the Penn sylvania railroad by the executive of ficers of the company began October 22nd, the inspectors traveling in four special trains. The observation trains consist of an engine drawing a hotel and dining room car, pushing a "gon dola," that is, a low, open platform car, with seats raised in tiers, the su perintendents occupying the first train, the civil engineers the second, the road supervisors the third, and the divison foremen the fourth. Each gentleman is provided with a printed form, on which ho makes on a scale of from 1 (very bad) to 10 (perfect) his estimate of each section of the roadbed. The verdict is reached by considering the condition of the track line, and the ballasting, ditching, draining, policing,'and neatness of the work. When the trip is completed these cards are made up and an aver age struck for each section. The highest average indicates to which of the supervisors shall be given the first prize, usually a chronometer gold watch and chain appropriately in scribed, and to which of the division foremen the second prize shall be given. There is great competition for these prizes, and the system begun some ten years ago has been found to be of the greatest value in getting the best kind of work done on the roadbed and lino of rail. Most of the superin tendents on this trip have intimate practical knowledge of what consti tutes a perfect road, for they have served the company of which they are now officers as roadmasters and divi sion supervisors, winning experience and promotion in that way. Last year the inspection was extended over all the leased lines of the company, the superintendents passing over on their trip more than two thousand six hundred miles of the company's track. In doing this, however, they were not able to give the track that close scru tiny which tho importance of their errand demanded. Therefore this year the trip will be confined to the main line and its im portant branch, the Northern Central Railroad from Ilarrisburg to Washing ton and Sunbury. Last year the sec tion south of Newark, a part of Su perintendent McCrea's division, won all the prizes.
