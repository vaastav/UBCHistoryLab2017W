2 The President's Message. Tothe Senate and Hwm of HcpnsehUitirat: Siuco the convening of Congress one year neo. the nation has undergone a prostration in business and industries such as has not been w itnessed with us for many years. Spe ulation ns to tho cause for this prostration might be indulged in without prolit, because as many theories would bo advanced as there would be inciepcnaem writers mose who exorcs&ed their own views. Without borrow fng upon the subject, and without indulging in theories as :o me cause 01 mis prosirawou, therefore, 1 will call your attention only to the fact, und to some questions as to which it would seem there should be r-o disagreement. During this prostration twoessential elements ol prosperity have been most abundant: la- bpr and capital. Uoth have boen largely unem ployed. WliCro security has been undoubted, capital has bean attniuablo nt very moderate rates. Where labor has been wanted, it has been found in abundance at cheap rates, com pared with what of tho necessaries and com forts of lifecould be purchased with the wages demanded? Two great elements of prosperity therefore have not been denied us. A third might be added. Our soil and climate are uncqualed within the limits of any contiguous territory under one nationali ty, for its varieties of products to feed and clothe the people, and in the amount of sur plus to spare to feed less-favored people. Therefore, with these facts in view, it seems to me that wise statesmanship at this session Congress would dictate ignoring the past and imsTimirrrox in toopeii channels these srreat elements of prosperity to any peo ple. l)ebt abroad is the only element that can, with always a sound currency, enter into our affairs to cause any continued depression in the industries and prosperity of our people. A great conflict for national existence made necessary, for temporary purposes, the raising or large sums ol money uum wuaiuyur source attainable, it mauc it necessary in the wisdom of Congress, and I do not doubt their wisdom in the premises.regarding the ne cessity of the times, to devise a system of na tional currency which proved to be 

1MPUSHIULE TO KEEI' ON A PAIt w ith the recognized currency of the civilized world. This begot a spirit of speculation, involving an extravagance and luxury not required tor the happiness or properity of a people, and involving, both directly and indi rectly, foreign indebtedness. The currency, being of such fluctuating value as .o be un safe to hold for legitimate transactions re quiring money, became a subject of specula tion in itself. These two causes, however, have involved us In a foreign indebtedness, contracted in good faith by borrower and len der, which SHOULD HK l'AIXJ IS COIN, and according to the bond agreed upon when the debt was contracted, gold or its cquiva- lent. The good faith of ttjet.overnment can not be violated toward creditors without na tional disgrace. Our commerce should be encouraged; American shipbuilding Und carrying capaci ty be increased ; foreign markets sought for the products of our soil and manufactories to the end that wc may be ablo to pay the debts. Where a market can be created for these sale of our products, cither of the soil, tho mine, or the manufactory, a new means is discover ed of utilizing idle capital and labor, to the advantage of the whole people. Hut, in my judg ment, the first step towards accomplish ing this object is to secure a currency HK)D WHF.IlEVEtt CIVILIZATION ItElONS; one which, If it becomes superabundant with one people, will find a market with some other; a currency wjliich has as its basis the labor necessary to produce it, which will give its value. Gold and silver are now the recog nized and mediums of exchange the civilized world over, and to this wc should return with the least practicable delay. In view of the pledges of the American Con gress when our present legal-tender system was adopted and debt contracted, there should be no delay certainly no unnecessary delay in fixing, by legislation, a method by which we will return to specie. To the accomplish ment of this end. I invite your special atten tion. I believe firmly that there can be no prosperous and permanent revival of business and industries until a policy is adopted, with legislation to carry it out, looking to A It KIT It X TO A 

SPECIE UASIH. It is easy to conceive Uiat the debtor ami tpeculalivo classes may think it of vnlue to make a so-called money abundant until th-y can throw a portion of their burdens upon otliers; but even these, I believe, would be tlisapjKiinted in tho result if a course- should be pursued which will keep in doubt the value of the legal-tender medium of exchange, a revival of productive Industries needed by all classes, by cone more than the holders of property of whatever sort, with debts to li quidate from realization upon its sale. Hut, admitting that the two classes of citizens are to be benefited by expansion, WoLl.b IT UE HON EST to give it V Would not the general loss be too great to justify such relief ' Would it not l)cjust as honest and prudent to authorize each d:bior,t issue his own legal-tenders to the extent of his liabilities its to do this? Would it not be safer, for tear of over-issues by unscrupulous creditors, to say that till debt-obligations are obliterated in th" United States, and now we commence anew, each possessing all he has at the tune, free front incumbrance These propositions mr ton absurd to lie en tertained for a moment ly thinking people, livery delay in preparation for tiual resump tion IMII i'AKK.S OF THE liHIIuM- I y, and is only less in degree as the hope is held out that a convenient season will at lat ar rive for the good work of redeeming our pledges to commerce. It will never come, in my opinion, except by positive action by Con. gress, or by .National disasters which will de stroy, for u time at least, the ciedit of individ u ds and the State at large. A sound curren y must be r"iicheil by total bankruptcy, or the credit and integrity of the nation and of individuals. 1 believe it is in the power of (.'oiign-ss, at this session, to devise such legislation as will renew confidence, revive all industries, start us on a career ol prosperity to last for many years, aud to save Uhm reditof the nation and of the people.

In a worse form does this apply lo Chinese wo men. Hardly a perceptible percentage ot them perform any honorable labor.

The Secretary of the Treasury, in his re- port, favors legislation looking t si'ci-pay-, meuis. thus supporting views previously ex pressed in this message. Hu also recom mends economy in appropriations calls at tention to the loss ol revenue from repealing the tax on tea and coffee, w ithout benefit to the consumer: recommends an increase of 10 cents a gallon on whisky; and, further, that no modification be made in the Hankim; number ot articles upou whteli dues aro lcvi- cd. I hose articles which i nter into our mail uiarmrcs, ana are nci prouueru at nomc, n seems to me should be entered free. Those articles of manufacture which we produce a constituent patt of. but do not produce the .whole, that pirt which we do not produce should enter fixe also. I will instance fine 12, !i74. ; I he higher grades of woolen goods. Chemi. ds used as dyes, compounded in medicines. and used in various ways in manufactures, come tinder this class. The introduction, free of dues, of such wools as we do not pro duce, should stipulate the manufacture of goods requiring these, as well as of those we do produce, mid therefore would be a benefit to home production. There are many articles entering into home lnanHfactures which we do not produce ouisclves, the tarill upon which increases the cost of producing the manufactured article. All corrections in this regard arc in the direction of bringing labor and capital in harmony with each other, and of supplying one of the elements of prosperi ty so much needed. THE AltMY. The report of the Secretary of War, here with attached, and forming a part of this message, gives all the information concern ing the operations, wants, and necessities of the army, and contains many suggestions and recommendations which I commend to your special attention. There is no cIhss of Gov. eminent, employees who are harder-worked than the army ofliccrs and men, none who perform their tasks more cheerfully and cMi cienily, and under circumstances of greater privations am! hardships. Legislation is de sirable to render more elllcieiit this brunch of ! the public service. I KKCOM l ENfHTI-'N;" OF Tin: SKCItl'.TAUY OF WAll. All the recommendations of the Secretary ()-jof War I retard ns judicious, and I especial ly Colli llieiiu uijiiui iiiit-uiiiui nit- n-iiiin ins . the consolidation of Government arsenals; the restoration of mileage toolilct rs traveling under orders; the exemption of money re ceived from the sale of sulsistenee Mores, without waiting tor the beginning of the fis cal year for which the appropriation is made; for additional appropriations for the collec tion of torpedo-material ; for increased ap preciations for the manufacture ot arms; for relieving the various States from indebt edness for iirms charged to them during the Kebellion; for dropping officers from the rolls of the army, w ithout trial, for the offense of drawing pay more than ouca for the same period ; for the discouragement of the plan to pay soldiers by checks; and for the establish inentot a Professorship of Rhetoric and Kit. glish Literature at West Point. The reasons for the recommendations are obvious, and are set forth sufficiently in the report attach t'd. tih; sT.'.i' v o.'i'.."s. I also lecomtnend that the Staff Corps of the army be status fixed, of the where this has not already been done, so that pro motions may be made, and vacancies filled as they occur in each grade, when reduced below the number to be fixed by law. The necessity for such legislation is specially felt now in the Pay Department the number of vacancies in that Department being below the number adequate to the performance of the duties required of them by law. THK NAVY. The efficiency of the navy has been in creased d iring'the lat year. Under the im pulse of the foreign complications which threatened us at the commencement of the last session of Congress, most of our efficient wooden ships were put in condition for im mediate service, and the repairs of our iron clad fleet were pushed w ith the utmost vigor. The result is, that most of these are in an ef fective condition, and need only to be mann ed and set in commission to go at once into service. Some of the new sloops authorized by Congress arc already in commission, most of the remainder are launched, and wait only the completion of their machinery to enable them to take their places as part of our effec tive force. Two iron torpedo-ships have been completed during the last year, and four of our large double-turreted iron-clads are now undergoing repairs. When these are finish ed, everything that is needful of our navy as now authorized will be in condition for ser vice; and with the advance in the science of torpedo-warfare, tho American navy, compar ativily small as it is, will be found at any time powerful for the purposes of a peaceful nation. SCIENCE. Much has also been accomplished, during the year, in aid of science, and to increase the sum of general knowledge, and further the interests of commerce and civilization. Kx tensivu and much-needed soundings have been made for hydrographic purposes, and to fix the proper routes of oceantelegraphs. Fur ther sui veys of the Darien Isthmus have been undertaken and completed; and two vessels of the navy are now employed, in conjunction with those ofKngland, France, Germany, and Russia, in observations connected with the transit of V'chus, useful and interesting to the scientific, world. NAVAL ESTIMATES. The estimates for this branch of the public service do not difl'er materially from those of last year, the general support of tho service being somewhat less, and those lor improve ments at the various stations rather larger, than the corresponding estimate made a year ago.

POSTAL CONVENTIONS. A Postal Convention lias liecn concluded with New South Wales; an exchange of pos tal cards established with Switzerland; and negotiations pending for evcral years with France have terminated in a convention w ith that country, which went into effect last August AN IN THUS TIONAl. 1'OsT l.

On the 14th of September lost the Governor of Louisiana called noon me, as provided bv the Constitution and laws of the United States, to aid iu suppressing domestic vio. l.ino.l in tli.i, C. ... 'I',.!- ...1. I......... in mm .juiiu. in is can was made in view oi a proclamation Issued on that day by 1). 15. Penn, stating that he was elected Lieu. tenant Governor iu 1872, and calling upon the militia of the State to arm, assemble, aud drive from power the usurpers, as ho desig nated the officers of the State government. On the next day I issued my proclamation,' commanding the insurgents to disperse w ith in five days from the date thereof, and subse quently learned that on that day they had taken forcible possession of the State House. Troops were taken by me to support the exis. ting aud recognized State Government, but before the expiration of the five days, the in surrectionary movement was practically abandoned, and the officers of the Statu Gov ernment, w ith soaic minor exceptions, resum ed their powers and duties. Considering that the present State administration of Louis iana had been the only government in that State for nearly two years; that it has been tacitly acknowledged and acquiesced is as such by congress and more than once ex pressly recognized by me, I regarded it asmv clear duty, when legally called upon for that purpose, to prevent Its overthrow by an armed mob, under pretense of fraud aud irregularity in the election of 1872. I have therefore call ed the attention of congress to this subject, stating that on account ot the frauds ajd for geries committed at said election, and because It appears that the returus thereof were never legally canvassed, it was impossible to tell thereby who were chosen, but from the best sourci's of informotion at my command 1 have always believed the present State officers received a majority of the legal Votes cast at that electiou. I repeat what I said in my special message of Jt'cb. lo, 1873, that ia tho event of no action by congress, 1 must con linue to recogLize the government heretofore recognized by me. I regret to say that w ith the preparations for the late election decided indications appeared in some localities the Southern States of a determination by in
