Mnt, the New Yerk anarchiat.has been sentenced to the penitentiary one year for using incendisry language Inching riot. The National Democratic committee hat been called to meet February a and to fix the titae aid place for holding the next National Convention. At the late election in Boston the dem ocrats elected the Mayor by a majority of nearly aooo. The common council stands 4 J democrats to 30 republicans. There are three preachers in the lower house of Congress, J. D. Stewart,of Geor gia, aad L. F. McKlnney, of New I lump hire, being democrats, and J. B. Cheadle, f Indiana, a republican. Hon. John S. Barbour has been nomin ated by the democratic caucus of the Vir ginia legislature to succeed Riddleberger la the United States Senate. He will be elected. I Rev. I. S. Kalloch, out of whose candi dacy for Mayer of San Francisco some years ago grew the trouble that resulted U the killing of De Young of the Chronicle, died coma days ago at his home in Sehome, Washington Territory. The Eugene City mi dm Is recalcitrat lag against the president's message in the seest refractory manner because the word does not appear in It. If ever the of the fool-killer were badly tt is in a newspaper office at Eu gone City. Carlisle asked the house to relieve him ad the duty of appointing a committee on elections for the house, on account of the fact that his own seat is contested. The house excused him and appointed a com snlttee Itself. While there Is no merit whatever In the contest against Carlisle yet courtesy required that he should not appoint a committee that should try his Two thousand members of the Evan gelical Alliance called upon the president at the White House the other day. Bishop Harris, of Michigan, told members of the Alliance that he considered the president's am ee sage magnificent, and that Cleveland waa the bravest president known to our generation.and that he should pray for his re-election. No class of people has suffered more from the effects of our robber tariff laws, nor received less benefits from them.than the farmer. If there is any such thing as men standing by their friend-, the farmer should stand by Cleveland in his effort to reduce taxation. We will now see what those newspapers will do that have pro teased to be the special friends of the farm- The Postmaster General has ordered a mail service to be established between this city aad Lebanon on the O. & C. railroad, hut the O. 8c C. refuse to accept the ser vice for the compensation offered by the department. Thus are we to be deprived of a much needed mail service through the niggardliness or contrariness of either the post office department or the rail road company. Mr. Hermann and Mr. Mitchell will now ask the department to restore the old star route service. While the latter is not what the people want, It would be a great improvement upon the present miserable service. Blaine has given his views of the tariff surplus question in a three column in terview. He frankly admits that our sur plus revenue ought to be reduced to the extent of $100,000,000 a year. He recom mends that the tobacco tax should be re pealed, but when told that thi, amounted to only about $20,000,000 per year he would not euggest any other reduction, hot contented himself with saying that a surplus is always easier to handle than a deficit," quoting from Fred Grant. Mr. Blaine will see sooner or later that the people are in no mood to be trifled with about this matter of tax and surplus relief, a Fred Grant lately found out in New York. The people want relief and they will not be trifled with. The National Republican committee wet at Washington City the other day and fixed June 19th, 1888, as the time,and Chi cago the place.for holding the next Nation ad Republican Convention. It is amusing to read Chairman Jones' speech calling the committee to order, wherein he descants upon the improved prospects ef the republican party to succeed next fall, a compared with the prospects four years ago. Now, four years ago the republican leaders held out the same glowing pros pects for the success of the party that they do now, and yet they were defeitcd. While we cannot assure our readers of democra tic success, we do not hesitate to say that democratic prospects are much brighter than they were four years ago. Republican organs,both large and small, any Cleveland's message means free trade. They all know better than this, but the highest conception they have of the way in which to treat the message is to gain a party advantage. Notwithstanding the recommendations in the message concern ing the reduction of duties on imports the president has a long way to go yet to be come a free trader. This raw-head-and-bloody-bones-acare-crow which republi cans are so wont to hold over the heads of timid people has lost all of its frighten Ing character and they will find it neces eary to devise something new to scare voters into the support of the plumed knight. The Chicago Tribune, the ablest repub lican paper in the west, has the following aneat on Blaine's interview concerning Cleveland's message I "Blaine, as might have been expected has presented high tariff protection from a partisan point of view as an opposition iaaue to the President's view on tariff re duction. Blaine's interview will have to stand upon its merit and will be endorsed or condemned in accordance with the value of the arguments set forth.and public judg ment will not be influenced by the distin guished name behind them. It is the weakest ground Blaine has ever yet occu pied, and no national party can expect to 0 Into a Presidential campaign on that sue, no matter who may be its leaders. The surplus question must be settled in some way, and in a very different way from what it has been settled. It cannot be settled in accordance with the Blaine Idea." This shows that many republicans of the Northwest 11s well as the East will not endorse Blaine as a candidate, on account of his tariff views as well as his genera witness for thu office. 

WHAT 18 FKKfc TRADK ? The Herald-th'sotminator aays To those who are shouting free trade n hoarsely feeble accents In the belief that thereby they are manufacturing wonder ful cap'ital to draw votes for future demo crattc candidates we commend these ex tracts from President Cleveland's mes sage." Will the Disseminator tell us what free trade Is I No, It will dodge the question as the Statesman,Sentinel, I laindea!er a n d ot h c r republican papers do. Except Frank Hurd, there U not a freetrader of any promin ence In the democratic party. l)oe our cotemporary think the sentiments ex pressed In the extracts from the message to which it refers, are new ? If it does, let Its editor read the democratic platform up on which Cle eland was elected, ami he will see that these sentiments are in per fect accord with that platform. The Dis- sassiseer knows.or should know. that there are none shouting free trade to get demo cratic votes. The truth is that the great predominant sentiment in the democratic party favors a moderate or low tariff, while the prevailing dominant sentiment in the republican party is in favor oft high.radi cal. protective tariff. This is vhe kind of tariff man our cotemporary is. We know this only in the fact that he is an ardent republican. The Disseminator fur ther say : "But the ndvocacv of free trade, tariff for revenue or protection straight i to be found among those individuals whose per sonal interest they suppose will be enhanc ed bvthe theory they advocate Irrespec tive of pa 1 1 v affiliation. This is a fa. t that cannot be denied or gainsaid." Well, then, all this profession of Interest in the welfare which Blaine, Sh-rman.Ed munds and Haw lev claim to have for the laboring man is mere de.iiairouv. AH v their pretense that they favor a high pro tective tariff in order to secure high wages for laborers U mere clotted nonsense Well, our neighbor Is right for once, but his sudden candor about the matter knocks every prop that sustains his political faith from under him. By the way the Dissem inator has long failed to let Its readers know how it stand on the following sub jects : Is It In favor of reducing the sur nlus now in the treasury of the I'nited m States, and If so how would It reduce it Would it make the reduction by making liberal, extravagant appropriations ? Or. would it reduce the surplus by removing the tax from whisky and tobacco.or would It make the reduction in ae-holc or in part by reducing the war customs tax upon the poor man's clothing, blanket, coal.lumber, salt and other necessaries of life ? These are burning questions, and farmers, me chanics, merchants, laborers and others are seriously inquiring about them. Will the Disseminator give its view on them NOT CAS DID. The free trade republican organ at Port land is opposed to any material reduction of the tariff, except on sugar. It wants sugar put on the free list. With a free trader, such a suggestion is coagulated torn-foolery, and shows at a glance that the organ i neither honest nor candid in making the suggestion. Every one knows that the United State, does not manufac ture one-third of the sugar consumed therein. The foreign manufacturers con trol the price of sugar in this country and would do so if the duty was removed en tirelv. Therefore the people would nol get cheap sugar, as the free trade organ suggest, but would have to pav iust as much as now. The $5000,000 collected as duties on sugar everv vear kocs into the treasury of the United States and not into the pockets of the protected sugar manufacturers of Iouisiana. Here the entire people of the country receive the benefit of this $50,000,000 paid as duties on foreign sugar. Not so, in the case of wool, woolen goods and many other arti cles indispensably necessary to the com fort of the poor of the country. On these articles the tariff is so high t hat.com para tively speaking, but few importations are made of such goods. Consequently the extra cost of such goods, in consequence of the tariff, goes Into the hands of the manufacturers and not into the coffers of the government. The Portland organ has but one motive in favoring the removal of the duty on sugar, and that is the hope of gaining a political advantage in the divi sion It might create among democrats. But men who love the ir country and de sire to see it prosper will rise above all party considerations in the adjustment of so grave a matter, and will be willing to yield many of their prejudices for the pub lic weal. For that reason we expect to see part of the duty taken from sugar, the tobacco tax repealed, and a number of ar ticles such as salt, lumber, etc., placed on the free list. Those who read the Port land organ will readily see that it would remove no duty that would affect a repub lican state and would leave none unre pealed that would affect a democratic state. When this Congress adjourns and the presidential election shall have passed, and another democratic president clectedt we shall then expect long articles in the free trade organ expatiating upon the beauties of free trade. Jimmy Blaine has been reading the president's message telegraphed to him in Paris. He don't like it. In fact the pres ident does very few tilings that Mr. Blaine does like.Qln fact, Blaine was very much put out when Cleveland was elected presi dent, and he has been in a growly .comba tive mood ever since. Blaine tells his views about the message and has them tel egraphed to the New York Tribune to be read by the voters of America as a kind of campaign stump speech. It is chock-full of demagogism. The artful politician is seen in every line. Its first and last salient point is a vulgar appeal to the anarchic socialistic clement of the country. If it has no other effect, it establishes the fact that Blaine is a candidate and signals his entrance upon the campaign for the nom ination. He will succeed, and, speaking from the standpoint of a partisan, we are glad of it, for the battle will then be easy for the democrats. If the republican party could not carry New York for Blaine in 1884 with only 25,000 prohibition votes and 40,000 demo crats voting for him, how can they carry it in 1888 with the prohibition vote in creased to 42,000 and no assurance of even 20,000 democrats to help them. This is a serious conumdrum for our republican friends to consider. Hats aad Caps At cost to close. N. II. Allen & Co., pro pose to sell every line of goods at cost. Call early and secure bargains.
