The contract for the woik was signed on the rfh of ctoler last ; the work it !f was commenced on the 20th of the same tuouth ; and there is now no doubt that the bat tery will be finished on or before the l.rth of Jan MR, ltiv.', wi'hin the specified period. About 10t0 skillful tnecJiitiics art- empleycd on various portions of the structure and its equipments, laboi is pn-Su-d both nighl itucj ilay. The central part of tiie huli and deck is nearly completed, at the Continental iron works, Greeu po::it. The principal engines and boilers and screws ate in an advanced sta;e, at the lMama ter iron works, foot of Thirteenth stre t. N. R The Novelty works are rapidly giving shape to the dcKth-dealiug turret Messrs. Club' Broth ers, of Sthenectady. will uot be behind with the turret engines and gnu-can iages. Three li:-c rolling mills iu this city are employing all their available forje in the production of iron plates. Captain Ericsson invests his undertaking with no mystery The public are free to know all about the plan, the dimensions, the armament, mid the most minute peculiarities of his unique iuvrution. The billowing description may cvu vey some idea of it : The battery rests upon two vessels, an upper one and a iower one. The upper is built of iroD, one hundred and sevcnty-toUT feet long, forty one feet four inches wide, and rive teet deep, with a draught of three to six inches, leaving only eighteeu inches of the sides exposed above the Wht -r lice. Th-sides are covered with a white oai bulwark, thirty inches thick, hut receive their principal protection from an a.mor of rolled plate iron, six inches thick The deck is male of oak beams, ten inches thick, covered with plank eight inches thick and a one-inch iron piate. The upper v-.vt- ! is Mjt-bottoined. and has a wedge-shaped s.cm and stern, l'he lower v. ssel, whih is entirely submerg.-d, is one Luudred and twenty four In t long, thirty four feet wide, and six teet six Lrches deep. It contains the working macLiuery. the rudder and i he anchor, housed away beyond reach of the enemy's shot. Upon the deck of the upper es :, and the only conspicuous object on this " low raking," and terrible craft, is the turret, twenty feet in diameter, nine feet high, and com posed 'of nine one-inch irou plates, lapped over each oilier and fastened with thousands of bolts. A shell-proof roof, six inches thick, covers the tdJTet, which is entered through hatchways from above. The total weight of the tunc! is one liundred and twenty tuns. The armament consists of two columbiad, which are preferable to rifle guns at short ranges) each carrying a ball of one hundred jjj I eighty pounds, and working through circu lar port holes three feet above the deck. The carnages are made of wrought irou. and move on tatged iron slides. The urret can ! turned " at pleasure by a spurwheel and gearing driven by a double-cylinder engine, and controlled by a lever iu tiie'tnrret. By thi contrivance the gacs can 1 aimed, almost instantly, at any ; 'jint of the Imriinii The rylindi rs for the ina'n engine are forty inches in diameter, with a piston stroke of twenty two inches. HmMH tor the boiler and for ventilation are worked by smell separate engines. The smoke is passed tin' through gratings in the deck. The entire cost of the battery will be VT.",000. Guns and men to work them will be furnished by the government. Among the requirements of the contract is one thut the battery sliall have a speed of not less than eight milts an hour. Captain Ericsson believes that this rate is easily attainable. There i- m.t " remaika'jle " provision, that the bat tery shall be tested at the shortest ranges before the enemy's guns. The inventor is not the bast aiaruird a! this prospective ordeal. It the uine iuch platings on the turret (she only exposed part) do not prove strong enough, three more inch plates can be put on without materially arTecting the draught or the salcty of the battery I'.ut it is believed nine inches will be a sufficient thickness. The best practicable thickness can tmly be ascertained by actual experiment. TLat i'nv and a half inches (the thickness of plates on ihe La (rlorre and Warrior) are not enough, was aouala.- torily proved by Captain Ericsson, :n experiua-ir. (.!:!:. te.1 ly him many years aT0- "Tbe test to wkUk lite battery will be subjected, w i.l probably sx-tt'e ail that is unknown about the resisting power of iron plates.

Khonld it not prove potent enough at the tirt iial about which no apprehension need be the additional plates can be attached iu a verv short time, and the success of the battery, iu the clc.l eugageu.euts and under the heaviest tire, be pla,loe'eiid any reasonable doubt. The practical results of this bold and original invention wi'l be Vvkni lor with great interest by military and scu .itiftc men in this country and Europe. K it, rmi Ki yaiu Irani Braufart. The Kew York Trilmnt's correspondence from lieaufort is to December "si, and what has been done since Dupott gave over the work to Sher man and his land force is summed up as fol lows : Reconnoissanct s of all the islands this side of Pert Koyal harbor, and of the wmJm laud from ,Sa wuah river up to Branfort have been care fully made. The damages to the captured forts liave ben repaired, and both put in perfect con dition for defense against any possible attack. Hilton Head Island, about twelve miles try seven, is wholly in miliury occupation, strong nSketa oceuDvin all imnonaut points, and Jlraddock's Point, at its extreme end. where guns were pointed to prevent the landiDg of our troops, is perinanen ly held. Intrenchmenls strengthen the positions and encampmtnU ot the whole of our force, not completed, but already extensive. Immense quantities of stores of every description have been lauded f;orn the transports, in lire most difficult circumstances, within adequate means and only by incredible lei.-''! Not less than fifteen hundred soldiers have been woiking day and night, much of the time in the water, aud without any but the simple! help for lifting aud transporting heavy weights. Everything has been brought on shore in small boats, the beach shelving gradually, and. until tfc'1 wL:,r: it finished, no launches or lighters beii.g able to approach within a con siderable distance. The wharf is well advanced in construction. built of htuzc nine lots, cut three to four miles away, partly dragged and partly floated Jowu4o ttie beach. A grea quantity 01 lumoer 101 oiuei nurnnses has been trot in the same way. That of which the storehouses were built, was brought in the transports. Of the storehouses, two are M by M feet each, two others each J25 feet by the same width. The stable is MO fret long and 3$ feet w ide, and about as much more is to be added. The h- avy labor imjiosed upon the jjoldiers by the refusal of the Va!lepartmeut to far-nisb laborers, and th large force required for the pickets, has interfered to some extent with drill tuid the regular routine of camp lite, yet a great deal has been done to improve the soldierly condition of the dii ision. Five to eight hours a day I am assured has been regularly devoted to drill, battalion and brigade movements, aud other instruction lor the xigencies of special service. The picket duty may be divided into two classes the inlyiDg. teat which is immediately about the brigades ; the outlying, much heavieand harder, ail over the island, holding roads and ferries and other important points. Add to this summary the expeditions in all directions, naval and m.litary, the occupation ol Tybee IglanFat Savannah and the possession ot St. Helena Sound to the north, twenty-five miles nearer Charleston than this harbaT, both having f ir'tieations which have been abandoned by the ebels, and I bebe some geneiai notion may ibe formed of the w ork accomplished up to the jpesx-nt date.

Some of the regiments are much better off than others : snd it is plain that their condi tion when 1 avk'g home has very much to d v. tb their present state. The Ix-st armed and officered regiment iic-re lias had perhaps tlie very hnrdest work to do, and still has not suffered so nuch as others. The knse ot feeling remains us 't was, and carries them through e erythiug. The contraband ouestum is not less interesting in its features than important in its relation to the expedition and the whole war. Eact are tm lumerous that the dirliculty is to select from the mass of materials those which are most im portant. I can only repeat, to-day, a few of the btateux nts. which come to me from the best of authority, Observing i:i the first place that there are not more than three hundred iu camp at pres ent. Their feeling of hostility to their late mas ters and gratitude to us is uumistakable and universal, and their readiness to work is shown in every way. The policy of Ctu. Sherman, or whoever is r sponsible for his remarkable proc lamation, I cannot pretend to fathom, nor am I able to see w hy their sei vices should not relieve the overworked soldiers from some of the heav iest tasks imposed upon them.

He was shot through the right wrist and side, and the upper portion ot the abdomen, the ball passing entirely i rough the body, aud lived from fl A. M , when he was wounded, till P. I saw him iu passing, a lew minutes after he was wouuded, and he recognized me, conversing freely but with pain, aud sliaking my hand on leaving him, lie requested me to state that he 'died the death of a brave soldier " as he did, iu every way worthy of his gallant and noble father. I left him in charge of my brigade and one other surgeon, with hospital attendants and a guard, and on mv return this morning from my camp ground, the hospital steward handed me a small blank memorandum book, in which was a history made bv his request, of which I luclose you a copy. He left his address, etc., with the chaplain of the. Tenth (Col. Lytle's) Ohio regi ment. Kev. H. E. O. Higgins, and told me that his family were residing iu X. wburg New i ork. I will endeavor to cominuuicate MB them as early as possible, and send each little memorial from him as 1 shall be able to collect them, for I yet cannot ascertain whtre most of his property Las gone, as the people of the house where he died would not attend to it. 1 liHve sent his re jiaius toward Eayetteviih-, where they will be iu i. it we are not able to take them to Cauley, tnougii I will, if possible, place the bdy therein a box with salt, to preserve it for his friends.

The New York Herald's llostou correspondent writes : The quarters selected for the use of the rebel commissioners are precisely the same as tjiose occupied by the other political prisoners. This room is a few doors from Coi. Dunmick's head quarters, in the same row, or rather under the same roof. The building is of beautiful New Hampshire granite, the roof forming the treplaiu af the work It has but one story above ground, which is divided into sev-ral fiue and airy apart ments. The basement contains all the neces saries for culinary operations, with quarters for servants, etc The largest rooms are about six teen feet square, with high ceilings, aud lighted by two large w indows. A marble mantel adorns the room, and a large grate furnishes the con venience for a good fire. The furniture of the room consists of a plain pine table, a few camp stools, the baggage of the occupants and a low wooden bedstead. A good straw mattress, M ith piilows of the same material, and heavy army blankets, make up the furniture of the room. To s..v the i'-ast, the ijuarters are moafc bett-r than liiey dese ve. As to living, they can mess w ith their friends IU the rate of one dollar per diem, having ail the staple OMBforts ot tiie mar ket ou the table.

In fai t, almost every thing but liberty is granted to them. Ow:u to the decision ot toe government iu relation to the usage of political prisoners, I think that some of those enjoyments wiil be curtailed u:it.i we can learn ttiat tzie gallant vorcoran ami others are treated better thau they have been. The PiraU- Miuilh uml Cel. Corcoran. The Philadelphia Laitr says : Wihiam Smith, who wa convicted of piracy. at the last term of the I niled States Circuit Court, occupies a cell along with his companiou Kocktnrd. ou the second corridor in the" untried depart meiit. and is in all respects treated as the other prisoners in tlie sine department, ins cell, like the others, is furnished wit a bed and bedstead, table and stools, aud is well lighted and ventilated. He.is allowed to see any of his triendi, and can receive auy articles from them but such as tlie rules of the prison prohibit and as to his fare, tlie government provides ample for that, the amounts allowed for the subsistence of each United States prisoner being forty-three cents per day. If Col. Corcorau, who, accor ding to the acting Secretary of War of the Con federate States, is to be confined in a cell appro propriated to convict felons, and to be treated iu all respects as if such convict, and to be held for execution in the same manner as Smith, the pi rate, now in Moyamensing, under conviction, only receives nan as good treatment as miui is j now receivmg, he will have no cause to com plain. Deem sentence is passed, prisoners are never treated as felons here. They remain ou toe untried side of the prison until the judgment of the court is pronounced. Smith has not been sentenced nor is it probable that he will soon bo. The trials of the other prisoners have been post poned until the next term of the circuit court, and it is not likely that he will be sentenced be fore that time. An Abelilieaiat Hrpndinlrd. The lutun Utmorrct, published at Dayton, Ohio, a paper which warmly advocated the Union movement at the last election, flying the Todd ticket at the head of its columns, says, in discuss ing the I n i -n State Senator question: The Cincinnati Emptirtr is right in its re marks. The I'uion Democrats made no bargain with Men. Wade. They don't owe lien. Wade anything. They regard Wade as a pestiferous politician. In Congress he w as against compro mise, aud has always been a bitter opponent of Democratic men and measures. We take it too, that the old Whigs are not under any obli gations to Wade. He once declared that " the Whig party is not only dead, but stiuketh " He helped to break up the Whig party. Conserva tive rueu of ail parties are not apt to look on Wad--! with favor. It ought not to astonish any man, t' erefore, if the I 'uion conservative men of Ohio should de sire the election of some one representing their views. They certainly are uot in favor of one who, in part, is responsible, by reas 'U of his ex treme views aud course as a politician, for the trouble uow afflicting the country. They are not in favor of oue who thinks the Chicago platform worth a civil war. They are not iu favor of oue who put party before country. The country can get along without lieu.

The general authorized the officer to have the offender arrested. The officer complaining took a squad of men w ith him, aud started in pursuit of the alleged vender of intoxicating drinks, and soon hatted in trout ol a carriage containing a basket of champagne, the contents of which were being Ii. . ly dispensed by the proprietor thereof. The officer made inquiry as to the name of the owner, anil w as iuformed that the proprietor of the team and champagne was Russell. "What Russell ;" asked the officer. "Kussell of the Loudon 7iw." "Are you selling this article ?" iu quired the officer, pointing to the champagne Selling the devil. Do you think I keep a grog shop "' responded Kussell.

Mr. Seward gives out, to s the German Erement element for himself, in the coming Presidential election, "did not consent to Fremont's removal until llie very last of the Cabinet," and thus opens a back fire upon Cameron, Chase, Iiiair, and even upon the President himself, who, at last, upou his own responsibility, ordered the removal, lor high cause. Cameron, th other aspirant for the Presidency, not to be outdone iu tactics, now becomes extreme anti-slavery from being the most conservative member of the Cabinet, chat ters abolition in Springfield, (Massachusetts.) and indorses it, Mhea, iu John Cochrane's army swell ' All this is but iutriirue intrieuc when the very existence of the nation is at stake, which everylsidv can see through. If Secretary Sew ard condemns President Lincoln's removal of i'reinont, and his revocation of Fremont's free ueero proclamation, it is his duty to leave the Cabinet. If Secretary Cameron is nut now of accord iu this and other matters, it is his duty to retire too. The President, iu this crisis, uoeds niity in his Cabiio t is entitled to it. Indeed ii is a calamiiy to his admiuistratiou that he has so many Presidential aspirants in it. A'eie York Erpresi. Baaa. Imta Price HI- Jlililac, Cnrrcr l.t itm Itf'suita. Ve take the following notice of Gen. Trice Irom the Richmond correspondence of the New ti leans Ihlla : I presume the history of this distinguished of ficer is familiar to you. It ought to be lamiiiar to tlie people of the Confederate Slates. It would show that in this age, as well as in farmer ages, circumstances develop genius, and that the pressure of events is enough to stimulate the lualitios of the hero, even when heroism his been latent and unsuspected. Gen Price s cam paign in Mexico was decidedly one of tlie most brilliant episodes of the war. His conquest M New Mexico with a slender force of volunteers; his fertility of resource and extraordinary energy aud enterprise, displayed iu suppressing the MD I irrr ' rebellion, and in his remarkable w inter campaign against the insurgent Indians, deserve to be recorded as the most shinir.g page ot the history of the Mexican war. Among the vieto rie.s gained by Geu. Price in that war were the l. i:ii.-s of Taos and Rosal-st the hrttef .ought against a greatly sucrior force, coinmin lod by I Tin Ainr: Tuna. Governor of Chihauhtta, a es-ntleman. who has, of late years, become well known in this country as a distinguished leader of the Mexioau leaders. The same characteris tics have marked Gen Price's recent campa'ii in Missouri: the same originality ol conception. nergv of action, readiness ol invention, and audacity of enterprise. 1 he attack upon Lex ington, which, after its successful finale, was ad- uittcd to bo one ot tlie most i aiians . . i . i the wuole war, was. it is unueiswou, imv aged here by the partisans !' the cautious and lilatory policy.

Western Stales The results flowing from a consummation of this kind cannot be over estimat -d. They extend far beyond the boundaries of Missouri. They reach the frontiers of New Mexico, and involve the destinies of Kansas, the Indian wenon, Arizona aud New Mexico.

BACUMUBB, upon whose staff the latter are. It was a noteworthy piece ot snobbishness. AOI-poiind shell was thrown yesterday from th" Lower Potomac rebel battery w ithiu a few feet of where the Is' Massachusetts regiment wasdrill iug. but failed to explode. Thirty-one slave women and children were brought up from the Sickles brigade yesterday, taken men the rebel plantations near Mathias Point. Tiie slave men taken at the same time are employed by Sickles as laborers. Mr. K.tliei idge, clerk of the I louse of Kepre sentalives. received letters from Tennessee last nie-ht. s'ating that the rebel leaden there had be cuu the impressment of minor men into the rebel army, and that hundreds ot loyal citizens were living into Kentucky. There are seventy fugitive slaxes at the Wash ing navy yard. They have all bcdi comfortably piovided by Secretary Welles, and most "f them are w orking for sylii a month. Marshal Lamon reports to the Senate that the imprisonment of slaves iu the government jail ot this city w as in strict accordance w ith the law s of the District of Columbia. The question of th exchange of prisoners seems to be fairly settl d. The New York exec utive committee had s- veral lengthy and inter esting interviews with the President, General McClellan, and Senators and members of the House, all ol whom favor it. The interview of the committee with Gen. McClellan was especi ally gratifying. He spoke of the subject briefly but warmly, and from his conversation, had evi dently given the su'ojec t much study. The military committees in b its houses have reported favorably on the subject, and a joint resolution, which passed the House, requesting the President to make an exchange, will pass the Senate to-morrow. Ati exchange has been practically going ou. Thirty prisoners were sent from h-re yesterday to FortMM Memo-, and a large number have been reSeassd from F-. rt Warren. WamiiikjtoN, December 11. There w as an alarm alohg the lines hurt night and the enemy was supposed to be apprcaehiug iu force. All night seven divisions of the grand army were under arms. The alarm proved to bo false, and at noon to-day all was quiet. The President has d ciined to conrmuuieate to Congress any communications addressed by tiie governments of England, France and Spain, iu regard to the armed intervention pi oposed by them iu the affairs of Mexico. He deems that it is inexpedient at this lime to do so. The statement that General McClelian hud in terfered with Secretary Cameron's report is false.

Jeaiiua K. lintdinu -liis.Fooli-li Coadnrl. The Montreal (Canada) Adrirtiser of Satur day hist contains the following : Colonel Dae Min. an English gentleman ot wealth and po-itioii, now staying in this ci.y, ie Oentij applied to Mr. Oiddiugs, the Coiled S'.ites consul, for a passport to pass through the United Stated en mutr for H ililax, to visit his daughter, married to an officer of oue of the reg bea ts there. Mr. Ci-ldiugs, not content with refusing a passport, did so in the most offensive manner, telliug Colonel Dawson that British sub-j-cts had no right to expert favors from the gov ernment of the Coi ted Statute, when they giveaid and sympathy to the Confederates; and liuaiiy gpniug into a furious eemliem, the consul de clared if Eugland wanted to fight, that she might come on, the 1 n o- l State, was leady for her. K- ararkitig oa the above, the Cincinnati Lit quirer says : Giddings ought to he romOTed from otiiec- at once for such rude ami unb-coming conduct, outrage.ins at any time, but specially foolish considering the dencete state of our foreign rela i. . -. When Giddings was Sent to Canada, the reason given was that we should be rid of a mis chievous agitator, wh ) would be harmless in a foreign mission, but wotiid lie dangerous if he remained at home, liut it seems "Old iid" is as troublesome in the farmer capacity as in the latter, and even more so. The Canada papers from which we quote adds : It is quite evident that Mr. Giddings is insane; the excitement of recent events has been too mash for ins mind, aud his trieuds should re move him to an asylum before he do s himself some mischief. We have thought Oildiugs waj insane for manv years, but it must be confessed these is "method iu his madness." It is high time that the administration closed his career iu Canada. Texas Items. We have Galveston papers to the lth instant. The firiwa of that date has the fellow iug: We are left alone la our glory ! Our e.otem porary of the fleees has sought the delightful sha les of Houston, w here his paper is to be pub lished. Yielding t" the apprehension of the peo ple generally, and believing it a duty, under the tiftnmstenrra, to place thai portion of our me lerial which we do not need, beyond the reach of danger, we shall send a c insidorable quanti ty to the up-country, retaining only enough to keep our business iu opera tioei ou a war basis. Notwithstanding all the stn'et talk about evac uation, etc , to be heard iu outside circles, aud which is gravely published, on the alleged au thority ot a council of war, by the Houston Ttltgrapk, we believe that should the enemy come, Geii. Hebert will afford fighting enough to accommodate the anxious gentlemen who haaahaan suilin' for a fight for the last ten years, aud who have retired to the up country in disgust, because they think he is disponed to dis turb their favorite pastime of demolishing Lin coluites. We believe fighting ground will be plenty ; and if Galveston should he attacked, und its fate should be to fall before superior strength and numbers, we expect to flaunt the last issue of the Cicttitn iu the fa.-e of tins foe, and if we can't move our type, sack a printing office and join our old neighbor and the balance of the rear guard.

If the destruction of life goes on at this rate, there is no doubt the allied powers now in the Gulf will interfere on the score of humanity. An Kxlraonliaaiy Sull Well. One of the most extraordinary salt wells on record, perhaps, is that now being operated at Wellsville, Colnmbiauu county, Ohio. The well sunk in auticinatiou of finding oil, but when at a depth of four hundred aud eighty feet, the borers struck a vein of gas, which burst forth with such violence as to eject all the toots used in boring, together with two hundred feet of pipe which had been previously iutrod .ced. The boring had developed a very strong vein of salt water, and the gas continued to spout the whole ... im'n afmmh and fresh water furnished by the well, to the height of one hundred aud fifty feet, for six months. The idea of manufacturing salt arka then conceived, and alter the nec-ssary nans, tanks, etc., were put up, the work was 'ominenccd. The gas was brought in pipes from the gasometer aud introduced into the tur h, var oits lets, which, ueinr nruiaju, v' form the whole office of eva- oration without any other fuel. The furnace glows with an intense heat, and the flames issue trom the lop oi ue The salt water flow? at th about six gallons per minute, and there is more than sufficient Eras to evaporate the whole. It rUlmi about a barrel of salt per hour. 1 he gas furnishes a pressure of one hundred and eighty- six pounds to the square inch, which is eighty or r. ,.i r iiu-h in, ue than is usually al- i i ,ns;, i hieoiiiotive entrine. 1 he well
