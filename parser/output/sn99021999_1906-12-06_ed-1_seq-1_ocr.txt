KENNEDY IN HOUSE DEBATE Oppoiet Bill to Permit Kational Eanki to Loan on Feal Estate. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST URBAN REALTY Congressman Moodell Introduces BUI to Give Homesteader, on the Shoshone Reserve More Time. (From a Staff Correspondent.) WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. (Special Tele gram.) One of the Interesting debates of the Fifty-ninth congress occurred today in the house on the bill permitting national banking associations to loan money on real estate and limit the time of said loan. This measure has had the earnest support of a very large portion of the west and south, the argument being that If the na tional banking; laws were amended so as to empower national banks to loan money on real estate for a fixed term It would go far towards popularixlng national bank ing Institutions, where now they are looked upon with a good deal of disfavor. Intro duced by a democrat from Georgia, It had the favorable recommendation of the com mittee on judiciary and many of the leiwl ing democrats. Including the minority 1 the Chase creek section. The principal street is near the beautiful stream and waa completely destroyed, It was there that the fatalities occurred, a the flood came in a head and engulfed the people without warning. The dead are mostly foreigners whoso names cannot be learned. Two Americans are known to have perished, one being caught on a pile of wrecka- fcnd drowned. North and South Clifton are swept by the current of San Francisco river. A new school building and scores of houses are washed away. The railway bridge 1 tottering. All information 1 vent out from a telephone office surrounded by water. The great smelting works of the Arisona Copper works are located at Clifton and the company's loss will be heavy. The Arisona dc New Mexico rail way will also be a heavy loser, as Its yards and shops are Inundated. Itimber of Dead Taknovrn. EL PASO, Tex., Dec . A special to the Herald from Cliftr.n, Arlx., the first au thentlo new out of that city since the flood prostrated all the wires, says: "The river 1 receding rapidly and the weather has cleared, hence no further damage la appre hended. Two bodies were recovered from the wreckage alone Chase creek, but the number of deaths cannot be told. Joe Throm, who waa rescued from the flood and whose wife waa lost, was taken to the hospital In a critical condition from bruises received, but will probably recover. Three Mexican, caught in tho act of looting mnd who refused to surrender to officers, were Shot and fatally wounded. The flood In Chase creek waa caused by the breaking of the dam of the Detroit Copper company, Impounding a vast amount of tailings, which ran down the creek with a seven-foot breast. Only one business bouse on Chase creek escaped damage, and many were entirely destroyed. The loss Is appalling. North Clifton was badly wrecked. Nearly all of the residence In that section were de stroyed or damaged. The , Becker-FTan Mercantile company. In that section, was damaged to the extent cf $10,000. The Colorado railroad suffered damage all the way from Clifton to Metcalf and It . will be several weeks before trains can pa over It lines.

There is a report in circulation that the Arisona Copper company will remove Its j points agreed upon wljl be submitted an early decision Is expected from the courts. When the attention of Presideift Allman waa called to that portion of the president' message made public yesterday, he aaid that the utterances of the president on the Japanese question, would have no effect on the action of the board. "We have simply put into effect a law passed by the law msking body of this state," he said. "In dividually and collectively, each and every member of the board, believes that it Is a good law. We will not recede from the position which we have taken, and believe that our action will be sustained by publio sentiment throughout the state, even If the court should declare It to be uncon stitutional or a violation of treaty rights 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. Inquiry todiy disclosed the fact that the legal proceed Ings to be taken In San Francisco by the TTnlted States district attorney in the mat ter of the admission of Japanese to the public schools of that city without dis crimination were Inspired by Secretary Root, who expressed the opinion that It would be one way of effectually disposing of the controversy. That the president's views on the sub.lect met with the hearty approval of the Japanese government was maae evident today when Viscount Aokl the Japanese ambassador, said that he had personally thanked the president for what he had said. A -rumor that a new treaty' Between tU United States and Japan was to be negotl ated, designed to remedy any detects in the one now la force, was set at rest today when both Viscount Aokl and Secretary Root unequivocally denied that such a thing waa now In contemplation. 

TOKIO, Dec. 6. The clear, firm and de termlned attitude of President Roosevelt In hla message In reference to the San Francisco school question and antl-Japa neee sentiment Is warmly praised. It Is felt that, however much the San Francisco school authorities may be affected by local sentiment, they can only yield to the moral weight which President Roosevelt's mes sage carrlea.

TO BREAK BONES Alleged Plugger Oars Cornelias Shea Ordered Men to Disable Xegro Tenmstera. CHICAGO. Dec. 6. A startling expose of the methods employed in the teamsters' strike was given In the trial of Cornelius P. Shea and his fellow labor leaders before Judge Ball In the criminal court today, when Joseph Schultx. alleged slugger, who with Albert, Toung, turned state evidence, waa on the stand as a witness for the state. Srhulta declared that Shea had told him to break the leg and arm of the strike breaker and especially to attack the negroes. When this means of bringing about defired result did not work satis factorily Schultx asserted that Shea ordered the hired pickets to throw eggs filled with acids at the horsea beln; driven by non union men. Aftr Schults had been on the stand several hours he was asked by Assistant State Attorney Miller: "What did Mr. Shea say concerning th negroes ?" "He said break their legs or their arms so they won't be able to work." "Do you remember In the early part of April, 16, seeing three negroes coming out of the alley back of the store of Mont gomery Ward & Co.?" "Tea." replied Schultx. "I saw tho men and Shea was there.

The opposition, however. was exceedingly strong, embracing as It did De Armond of Missouri, Weeks of Massachusetts and Hill of Connecticut. Congressman Kennedy took a hand in the general discussion and his questions and hla statements precipitated a general debute lasting for nearly two hours. Mr. Kennedy opposed the bill on the ground that If It was a proper measure It ought to Include city real estate as well as farm land, and that the bill as amended by the committee was class legislation. It was contended by the advocates of the bill that In all cities there were trust companies and savings banks to make such loans on city property, but Mr. Kennedy called attention to the fact that In the city of Omaha there were no trust compantea to make such loans and only two savings banks. The bill passed the house by a vote of Hi tq 51. but Its passage through the senate Is thought to be extremely doubtful. Kehraakan. at Capital. Henry T. Clarke and E. J.

Congressman Mondell of Wyoming today Introduced a bill giving homestead entry. men on lands formerly embraced in the Shoshone Indian reservation an additional tre months after the date of filing tfpon their lands, or until May 15, 1807, to estab lish a residence upon the lands entered by them. Under the original act of March 3, 1906, they would have to establish their residence on February 15, 1907, and as weather conditions in Wyoming are usually exceedingly unpropltlous in February, It has been deemed wise to extend the time I of establishing residence three months; longer.
