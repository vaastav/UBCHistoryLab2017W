MESSAGE. Theif must be Bomethiog in tb? chastening offices of adTorsity, for the present Message of the Presidenta written in the shadow of the November elections, is in many respects hi-* best. So fir as it. dials willi questions relat? ing to partisan polities, and to those involved m the government of the Southern states, it was not to be expected thai he could say anything which would meet the approval of those who, like Titi Titim n.-, have con? demned his a.'ii'ni in Louisiana from tho bc ginningm unlawful ami disastrous.

PRESIDENT A.\:> TOE snVTfT. (...i. (?rmt gives ootiee to Congress and tin- country t!:;it h- finds nothin : to regret in his past treatment if th? South, nnd has no eli ,?' re b. promise in his policy for the future. Ile h is (??.".' 1 the Knforc aienl laws ne? cording to their letter and their spirit, nnd he will rep al tho trnn actions of the recent cam? paign whenever tho occasion arises. He firmly believes in the storied .-T the lion? Charles Ii y and the Chattanooga Convention. He approves of Besch, Hester, and Hodgson, Ibj denounces t.ie Southern whites v.ith great bitterness for tho crines of murder, outrage, an.l intimidation by which they have attempted to control the vote of the freedmen; and while be admits that they have hid to livo und r rathi r "trying'' gov? ernments, bo Intimates that they grumble altogether too much. This is Bot a cheerful declaration from our Chief Executive, but it is precisely what might bave been expected from his obstinate character, and wo have not the slightest doubt thai he will cany on) his rough policy to tho end, nnlees ho is checked by Congress. Ho is right, ol coarse, in lus d?termination to execute the Enforce? ment laws so lung as tlmy remain upon the statute books; that is btS plain duty; but lu?. bas allowed the partisan coal of bis officers to carry them for beyond tho authorization of the law and to commit the most dangerous excesses in tim sacred name of justice. These are wrOBgS about which COBgTBBS will proba? bly have something to say before another opportunity is presented for their commission. In rcspmt to Louisiana the Profilent is complacent ?md resoluto. He repeats what be said long ago in his special message, that after once recognising the Kellogg Govern? ment be nhill feel justified in stn king to it until ?t le upset by a resolution of Congress, Ho cannot excuse his support of the usurpation ou any such ground u this, for it is n familiar rule of law that no man may take advantage of his own wrong. Kellogg \\;>s originally set up by a baud, in Which Gen. Grant was one of the chief movers, and it is monstrous to pretend that the President is not at liberty to reoogoiM tho trim Govern? ment beeauBe be baa heretofore unlawfully aided tin? false one. lint his determination, wrong as it is, throws upon Coogreeea reapon?? Hihilily which that body cannot ?illbrd to disre? gard. Gen. Grant would undoubtedly be very piad to get rid of Kellogg. The Republican party likewise fi els that it has carried that dirty burden quite long OBOBgh, and that it must loso no time iu unloading, if it ever means to run unotlii r race. We know of few things that would give the party moro valual.lo help with less trouble linn tim passing of nu ?iel immediately for the relief of LoniaiaBa. Upon the Whole WC take ii to be chiir from the Message that tbo South has aothiag to bops from Geo, Grant. Ho has learned ROthiog from the elections. He has no idea ol' in,iking any chango in his course. II another political campaign were to open to? morrow ho would give the Attorney -General and his deputy marshals longer ropo than ever. Tbe soflMuga of the Boothera whites do not ton h bim ; ho dorn not comprehend them; luv never did. And if Kollogg'a Ro t urning Hoard muster ROBTRge enough lo (heat tim people out of the election of last month as they did out of that of IfiQL they mar depend upon tho stiouort ot tho riiriiilcnt. If there m to beany help for the Prontrntn ?State? thin Winter it must como from CongKSS.
