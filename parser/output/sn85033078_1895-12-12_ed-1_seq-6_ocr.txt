Washington, D. C., Dec. 2. —The fifty fourth congress began its public ses sions at noon today with crowded gal leries. For the third time in the last twenty-one years the popular will found expression in a reversal of po litical dominance and the new con gress was called to order with demo i cratic ascendancy in the senate on the point of disappearing and the house overwhelmingly republican. There were fifteen nett faces among the sen ators, not counting Mr. Chilton, of Texas, who reoccupies a seat he once held before by appointment, and there were in addition thirteen re-elected senators to be sworn in by Vice Pres. Stevenson as their own successors. Of the holding-over senators, whose terms will expire two years from now, some of the most prominent, including Blackburn, Brice, Hill, Voorhees, Vest, Vilas and Peffer, took their seats with the shadow hanging over them of strong probability that their places might be filled by others when this congress expires. Promptly at noon Vice Pres. Stevenson tapped the gavsl and the blind chaplain of the senate, Mr. Milburn, offered prayer. The sen ators-elect were next sworn in. Mr. Sherman, republican, of Ohio, offered a resolution to inform the house that the senate was ready for business. On motion of Mr. Vilas, democrat, of Wis consin, a committee of two was ap pointed to join a similar committee on the part of the house to wait upon the president and the vice president naming as such committee Mr. Vilas and Mr. Allison. The senate then at 12:30 took a recess fer an hour. Im mediately after the senate resumed its session Mr. Sherman moved an ad journment. Washington, D. C., Dec. 2. —In ihe lower house before noon all the seats on both sides were occupied by those entitled to them— the 244 republicans occupying, as usual, the western side and the 105 democrats the eastern side. At noon Rev. Mr. Paghy, chap lain of the last house, offered prayer. Then Mr. Kerr, clerk of the last house, called the members to order and the roll of states was called, be ginning with Alabama. 341 members responding. Mr. Grosvenor of Ohio, republican, rose and said: “I have the honor to present the name of Thomas Brackett Reed, a representa tive in this body from the state of Maine for the office of speaker.” Be fore the sentence had teen finished a hand clapping was started among the republican members and for a min ute or so the clapping was kept up <>n the floor and repeated from the galler ies. Mr. Sayers of Texas, democrat, nominated Charles F. Crisp, of Geor gia. Mr. Reed was elected by a vote of 244 ayes against 95 for Mr. Crisp; 6 for Mr. Bell, pop., of Colorado, and 1 for Mr. Culberson, democrat, Texas. Mr. Reed made a short speech folio wr which the members drew seats. Washington, Dec. 3. —In the senate Cullom (rep.. 111.,) and Gallinger, (rep., N. H.,) offered memorials asking the government to take action con cerning the condition of affairs in Tur key. Dubois, (rep .)

Mass.) introduced a resolution forcibly approving the Monroe doctrine. Call (dem., Fla.) introduced a resolution di recting that the insurgents of Cuba be accorded belligerent lights.

Y.) chairman of the committee appointed to wait upon the president reported that Mr. Cleve land had sent his respectful saluta tions to congress and would communi cate in writing. Immediately thereafter Mr. Pruden, the president's executive clerk, ap peared with the message, which the speaker forthwith laid before the house. As the clerk commenced its reading the house became quiet and the members listened, some intently, but all respectfully, to the words of the chief executive. Washington, Dec. 4. —The senate worked today, while the house enjoyed a recess, but m'ost of the business transacted was of a routine character. Mr. Hoar showed a disposition toward co-operation with the president in dealing with the Turkish question by offering a resolution denouncing the recent atrocities in Turkey and assur ing the executive branch of cordial in dorsement by congress of a vigorous course for the protection of American citizens in Turkey and the suppres sion of the barbarities against Chris tianity. Mr. Hoar did not ask imme diate action on the resolution, but he secured the adoption of another reso lution requesting the president to sub mit to the senate all correspondence relating to Turkey. The resolution makes specific inquiry as to what American consuls are absent from their posts by reason of the disorder prevailing. The first formal speech of \he ses sion was made by Mr, Allen, of Ne braska, on Cuba and the Monroe doc trine. Mr. Allen urged the recogni tion of Cuban insurgents, tire annexa tion of Cuba and a strong foreign policy. The influx of bills continued, several hundred being added to those already introduced. Among them were the following: By Senator Lodge—To amend the immigration laws, excluding all immi grants between 14 and 60 years of age who cannot both read and write the English language. By Senator Gray—To incorporate the International American Bank in ac cordance with the recommendations of the international American conference. By Senator Cullom —Providing that no person shall be eligible as assignee or receiver of a bankrupt railroad who shall have been a director, officer or employe of*feuch road at any time within three years. By Senator Voo~hees —Increasing all pensions granted under the act of 1890 to sl2, and providing punishment for persons guilty of contempt of United States courts. The bill makes moving about, talking or the making of gestures while a court is sitting an act of contempt, and provides punish ment either by fine or imprisonment. Washington, D. C., Dec. 5. —The first bill introduced in the senate today was one by Mr. Mills (dem., Tex.) for the coinage of the silver in the treasury. A bill was introduced by Mr. Chand ler (rep., N. H.), for the coinage of sil ver at the ratio of 1S 1 to 1, the bill to become operative when England, Germany and France pass similar laws. Petitions from Florida for the rec ognition of Cuba and from the legis lature of Montana against further is suance of bonds were presented. A resolution offered by Mr. Call (dem., Fla.) was adopted, calling upon the secretary of state to send to the senate the correspondence relating to the case of Gen. Sanguilly, an Ameri can citizen, sentenced to life imprison ment for alleged complicity in the Cu ban revolution. Mr. Gallilnger (rep., N. H.) intro duced a resolution declaring it to be the sense of the senate that it was un wise and inexpedient to retire the greenbacks. Mr. Mitchell (rep., Ore.) introduced a resolution, which w’as agreed to, calling on the secretary of the treas ury to inform the senate why the con struction of the public building at Portland, Ore., for which an appropri ation was made by the last congress, was not proceeded with. Mr. Call (dem., Fla.) addressed the senate in the advocacy of his resolu tion for the recognition o f the bel ligerency of Cuban insurgents and for 4 strict neutrality by the United States in the war. The president left Washington Thursday night on the lighthouse ten der Maple to recuperate from the strain he has been under in the prep aration of his message to congress. He is on a hunting trip through the North Carolina sounds. With him are Dr. O'Reilly, Commander George F. F. Wilde and Commander Benjamin P. Lamberton. The vessel is well pro visioned and it is likely that if the weather is fair the president will not return to Washington before Decem ber 12 or 14. Washington, Dec. 6. —When the house met Mr. Baker (rep., N. H.) asked unanimous consent for the im mediate consideration of a resolution calling on the secretary of agriculture to report to the house whether he had expended the whole of any part of the appropriation made by the last con gress for the distribution of farmers’ bulletins, but Mr. McMillan (dem., Tenn.) objected. Mr. Walker (rep., Mass.) offered a petition in the form of a resolution from the naturalized Armenians of the United States against further out rages. A 

NICE WIDE OPENING. “Henry!” “Yes, your excellency?” “Senator Harris thinks he seen an opening for a free silver party.” “Is there one, sire?” “There is, Henry. There is an open ing big enough to bur” such a party.” —Pittsburg Chronicle. What is more exasperating than to forget a good thing just as you’re on the point of saying it. and then go groping round for it in the dark, with the tail just tickling the fringe of your recollection —and never get it? He —I suppose you consider me a roasted chestnut. I'm here so often. She —Hardly. A roasted chestnut pops. OUR GOLDEN WIDOWS NEW YORK THE MECCA OF HCS BANDLESS WOMEN. HOBBIES THAT DIVERT THEM A Few of Them Have a Fondness for Charities —Some Are Young and Lovely with Dollars on All Sides of Them —Gen. Grant's Faithful Companion. New York city must be a good pla?e for widows, if we are to judge by the numbers who go from all points of the compass to that great city. The Mrs. W. H. Vanderbilt. widowers are almost an unknown quantity. Old men are scarce as hen's teeth, and this leads one to believe that the good oid husbands and fathers in their efforts to provide choice food, goodly raiment and an occasional duke or prince for their womankind, wear themselves out, body and soul, early in the fray, and when they reach middle age, calmly betake themselves to a land where there is no more work. To Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt is ac credited the glory of owning more money than any other widow in town. She has eight sons and daughters and their wealth combined exceeds three hundred million dollars. In her own right she has an immense fortune, which is to go some day to her young est and favorite child, George Vander bilt. Mrs. Elliott F. Shepard, Mrs. Van derbilt’s eldest daughter, has been a widow for three years. She lives in one corner of the great Vanderbilt /V< ;v ". V 1 \ \ > y Mrs. Cannon. mansion on Fifth avenue, extending from Fifty-first to Fifty-second street. Mrs. Shepard has more than twenty million dollars, and the best portion of her income is spent in the splendid charities originated and operated by the Vanderbilt family. Her especial pride is the Margaret Louise Home, which she has given to the self-sus taining woman and girls of the coun try. Mrs. Harry Le Grand Cannon is the youngest of all the society widows. She is only twenty-three, and is as fair to look upon as when, five Shears ago, she came from the west and won the heart of the popular young cotillon leader. Mrs. Cannon was Miss Eliza beth Thompson, and she inherited a good many millions from the Brush estate, of electric light fame. Just a few blocks up Fifth avenue from Mrs. Cannon's artistic nome, lives the handsomest widow in New York society, Mrs. Samuel Colgate, who was Cora Smith, of New Orleans. Mrs. Colgate is tall, slender and grace ful, with an exquisitely modeled head, and a face good to look upon. She has not long passed thirty, and has eight m m Mrs. Shepard. million dollars to add to the fortune of her beautiful face. Mrs. Ward McAllister will continue to make her home in New York city, but few will benefit by her presence, for hers is one of the faces we never see. She has long been an invalid and never accompanied Mr. McAllister into the social life which was so very much a part of his very existence. Miss Louise McAllister took her mother’s place, and entertained for her father, and was always his companion and chum. Mrs. William Astor is one of the richest widows in America. She nas just moved into the magnificent pala'-e her son on upper Filth avenue. Mrs. Astor is rich in houses. She owns one In Paris, v/here slie spends the spring months; a palace at New port for July and August, and Fern cliffe. the country home at Rbinebeck, on the Hudson, which she visits in the early autumn, returning to her New York home when the horse show sets the social ball rolling in November of every year. Mrs. Kingdon, the mother of Mrs. George J. Gould, Mrs. Brockholst Cut ting. Mrs. Joseph W. Drexel and Mrs. Fred Wilson, Freddie Gebhardt’s sis- ter, are a group of women with dollars to right of them, dollars to Teft of them, and dollars just all around them. They have a good time in their own peculiar way. Mrs. Kingdon seems to find her greatest happiness in the royal good time her daughter, Mrs. Gouid, manages to have. Mrs. Cut ting is entirely devoted to her two sons, Brockie and Winkie. Mrs. Drexel is a superb musician, with three daughters, who are adepts on the harp and piano. The musicals Mrs. Drexel gives in her splendid home on Madison avenue are world-famous. Two of the most interesting widows in New York are Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant, wife of the great northern leader, and Mrs. Jefferson Davis, wife of the pres ident of the confederate states. Mrs Grant owns a magnificent home on the fashionable west side, near Riverside park. The halls, parlors and libraries are filled with reminders of the dis tinguished general. There are battle pictures hung with tattered old flags, busts in bronze and marble and won derful gifts from all sorts and condi tions of people. Mrs. Davis lives with her daughter, Miss Winnie Davis, at one of the fashionable hotels on Fifth avenue. Here she receives with old- Mrs. Colegate. fashioned southern hospitality, the flower of northern and southern chiv alry. It seems strange that these two women, whom the war left in such widely different spheres, one the wife of the conqueror, the other the wife of the conquered, should come after long years from the west and the south to live in New York. Strangest, of all is the fact that they are warm personal friends, and spend much of their time together. The Impressionist. I was late, but it \vas unavoidable, somebody else’s business detained me —I would not have allowed my own to —and consequently I felt somewiaat nervous as I was ushered in. “How good of you to come, after all,” she said. “I’m so glad! When 1 saw r it was raining—a little (it was really ‘cats and dogs’)—l was afraid you wouldn’t venture out! 1 suppose you waited to see if it would clear up.” “I knew you couldn’t resist the temptation to tease me,” was my smil ing reply, for I felt this time I had the better of her. “Victory for ycu,” she acknowl edged, pushing toward me my favorite chair, “and w r e are both in a good hu mor today, aren’t we?” “I am always in a good humor.” “Oh! So am I,” she answered. “Well, then, that’s settled,” and I sank into Ihe chair. “The next ques tion is how long are we to remain so?” “I don’t like to discuss periods of time with you. I notice you have only one series of adverbs, such as ‘always,’ ‘forever,’ and ‘as long as I live.’ “And you dislike them?” “I don’t say that; it depends—but they are a little extreme, don’t you think?” “Do you realize that I have called on you every day this week, and isn’t that a little extreme? This is the sixth visit.” “I don’t know if you are right in your calculations or not, but I’ll ask my sister-in-law. She’s sure to have kept count.” “But how will she know?” “I don’t know how. She has strange and, I believe, occult means of finding out everything. She is much more of an authority on my own af fairs than I am. For one thing, she has a window, in sight of which my front door naively is. Of course, she never watches, but she sits in that window, and naturally she doesn’t shut her eyes. Then she is very neigh borly, never misses a day coming over, and each one of her questions is sure to hit some nail on the head. Verifies her eyes through her ears, as it were. Don’t think I mean she’s prying, be cause she ain’t. She’s a dear soul and a born mother, that’s all, and, not hav ing any children, she has to take care of anything that comes her way, even a widowed sister-in-law very near her own age.” “If you need any one to take care of you,” I began. “Oh, dear, no!” she answered. “I am tired to death of it. I want to take care of somebody myself for a little while.” “You think I would be a difficult ob ject to handle?” “Yes,” she laughed. “I am afraid it would be a case of playing with fire and burning one’s fingers.” “I wish I did know your real opin ion of me,” I sighed. “Isn’t that a very courageous wish?” she suggested “Well, then, I’ll put it this way. I wish you could know my opinion of you.” “But I do know it.” “I never told you.” “Haven’t you? Oh, however, other people have.” “Who?” “Let me sec. My sister-in-law for one.” “Hang !” I stopped. “How is it out?” she asked. “Warm?” I laughed and broke up my anger. “Not so warm as indoors just at this moment,” I said. Then a brilliant idea came to me, and I added: “I’ll tell you what I’m going to do! I’m going to ask your sister-in-law to let me paint her portrait!” “Tow Bowles, do you care as much for me as all that?” “Do you think she’ll like the idea?” “Like! She’ll be flattered to death. Her personal appearance is her one weak point!” Of course I shall expect you to come with her and chaperon us during the sittings.” “Oh!” “And you must give me points to help me win her over to my side.” “Your side of what?” “Mrs. Turnbull, why do you hold me off so?” As I spoke I vowed to my self “now or never.” “ ‘Hold you off!' ” and she laughed, nervously. “What a remark. I don’t hold you in any way.” "I can’t. I won’t jest any more about it,” I said, "and if you are the woman I love you’ll listen to me.” “I’ll listen to you,” she answered with a final flicker of her teasing hu mor. “whether I am the lady you men tion or not,” “You know,” I continued, paying no attention to what, she said, “a busy man does not go to see a woman every day in the week simply to kill time! You know a man does not try to pro pose to a woman on an average of twice an afternoon for a week unless he means it! You know if a man can't take his eyes from your face that he loves you, and you have never seen my eyes wander You know, you must, that uncertainty even for an alumnus half-back is terrible. I’ve been on tiptoe night and day all week; I’ve been embracing the empty air, and kissing the unsubstantial sun shine and moonlight! My patience is all gone, but my love remains immov able. Why have you let me get so far toward asking you the one leading question in Cupid’s catechism, and then every time pulled me up short — breathless and angry? Why?” “I’ll tell you,” she said earnestly, interrupting me before I could say more. “The truth is, you’ve been so nervous about it, so timid, suggesting everything and saying nothing, beat ing around the bush, and leading up the point by easy stages, that by the time you were ready to say the word I was so nervous myself and fidgety, I was actually afraid! A sort of stage fright it was. T didn’t care to let you speak. If you had ever asked me straight out I don’t doubt I’d have ac cepted you long ago.” She paused only for breath, but I didn’t wait. “Will you marry me?” I asked, al most with a gasp. “Yes.” And that was all we said for a long, long time. —Clyde Fitch in Life.
