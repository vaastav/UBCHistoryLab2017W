FRANK L. HOOGS MANAGER TUESDAY DECEMBER 3, 1907 v-, : Roosevelt i On Hawaii V, urge can ....... ..v. President Roosevelt's message as far as it relates to Hawaii is as strong as we could have wished in Ir its recommendations of relief from I our transportation difficulties and ......... m. v.-. improvement ot reari naruor. 1 w " " " president, it is to be noted, does not cenmuinn nf the coastwise shipping laws, unless the remedy i. .L.i !, rvtlir w.iv. bv the cncouraircmcnt of American shinniwr. In this he is in line with a policy favored by many local business men and repeatedly urged in these columns, it win do time enough for Hawaii to ask that encouragement and aid be given to foreign steamers when it has been found that the American vessels cannot get the business. The President, however, recognizes that the subsidy plan may again fail, and he plainly states that if Congress is not prepared to encourage American shipping so as to give Hawaii re lief, the coastwise laws should be relaxed. There is reason to expect that in one way or the other, relief will be given. It is probable that the ship subsidy matter will be one of the great topics of the session. The bill which so nearly passed last time con tained no provision for a Pacific subsidy, except as between American and South American ports. The President's message, urging "aiding American vessels" and specifically calling attention to the harm done Hawaii by failure to protect shipping, brings these islands into the discussion. It is said on good authority that during the months which have elapsed since Congress last met, many converts to the subsidy plan have been made. There will be scarcely anything in the session more important to Hawaii in the long run than the fight to restore American shipping. Tales Woith Teltiug J THE 

FINAL. SHOWER, "And you say when the heiress be enmo tho wife of the forolRti noble mini it was a shower weddliiE?" "I should say o. Tho bride wore n shower bouauot." "Yes." "And then there was u shower of rice." "My!" "followed by a shower of congratula tions and old shoes." "Well! Well! And how did It end ui?" "Very embarrassing all around. The nobleman's creditors camo around and presented u shower of bills." w..vm:o:"I&4a A man on trial for the fourth : Courts In I A Tangle ? time, after having been found guil- t iy uy uie imics 111 unci; jitviuua trials, for a murder committed over seven years ago, is the spectacle . which the State of Kentucky pre sents in the hearing now going on of the charge against Caleb Powers, of murdering Governor Goebel, No matter what is the result of a trial like this, the machinery of jus tice has failed lamentably. Powers has spent his fortune during his seven years in jail, in efforts to prove the innocence he claims. Three times jurors all of one political party, led by partisanship on the bench, declared him guilty and the last time they declared for the death pen alty. The highest court in the state each time set aside the verdict. The murder was a political assassination and the task of getting at the truth in the heat of partisanship was too much for the courts. In an other conviction is had it is' safe to say that it will not now convince many of those who believe in Powers' innocence. Similarly if he is acquitte few minds will change, while his seven years of punishment will have been declared a hideous injustice. Those who oppose the jury system can find some fine material for argument in this and sqine other recent American cases. Probably, at heart, most of those who rejoice at the deserved conviction of Ma yer Schmitz, Louis Glass and other San Francisco grafters, felt that they didn't really have a fair trial. The effort to try Thaw on the grave charge of murder might be rendered into a farce comedy witli experts as leading men. In Idaho a couple of months were taken to try Haywood and the plain issue of his guilt or innocence became largely a political struggle before twelve sworn jurors'. And in Wash ington today the Thaw farce is being repeated, with twelve' laymen trying to reach a certain, conclusion as to which of disagreeing alien ists are right, obviously a thing logically impossible to do. Improving Currency I The establishment of postal sav ings bank is being discussed on the Mainland, as a means of improving financial 'conditions, and Drad street's says that it may be taken granted that the plan for supplying credit currencywhich was embod icd in a report adopted by the American Bankers' Association a short time ago will be actively pushed in Congress when that body gets fairly down to work at the next session. The money stringency .which lias been experienced of late will naturally be made the basis of a plea for changes intended to make the volume of the currency more responsive to the demands of commerce, particularly with the view of securing an ample supply of currency when needed. Of late, also, there has been a revival of the proposition to create a central bank, which was favored by the special currency committee of the New York Chamber of Commerce last year, and which has been suggested as a desirable solution of some of the country's currency difficulties by Lord Ave bun. It may be that some project of this nature mav be sutrcrested for the consideration of Congress. These and other plans arc deserving ot carciui scrutiny and discussion and should receive them. Every . plan for currency improvement should be examined in an unhurried way, without prejudice or prepossession, and the fact that it or snmn- thing like it has found a place in foreign systems should not prevent us uavnig consuieration in America. Apparently there is nothing in the President's message, in discuss ing Hawaii, about "small farmers" or immigration. President Roosevelt stands by hissguns. Panic or no panic, he in tends to keep up the warfare on "successful dishonesty." The Star yesterday inadvertently referred to the city of Atlanta as n the state of Alabama, instead of Georgia. It is not likely that Ala bama would feel complimented in view of some of Atlanta's recent performances, and The Star had no intention of depriving Hoke Smith's state of its own. ' WJ 

STRIPPED CLEAN. Tho hostile cruisers were anchored off tho Amorican coast. Suddenly they weighed anchor and put to sea at full speed. ''What caused tho sudden departure? asked tho war correspondent. "Tor pedo or mines?" "Neither," laughed tho general of tho fortress. "I just signaled that wo were about to strip each ship." "But they wero not afraid of our suns?" "No; they thought wo wero going to send souvenir hunters to do tho stripping." Tim awnnf oltlfrnt Irlnil In rnnnh C bVoro the stalwart supes could get the hook. "Ah, Gaston," sho chirped, "did you notice tho range in my voice." "Yes, Cleopatra," replied t;ho tall comedian in "a solemn voice, "and I would advise you to put some stove polish on tho range." "The idea! Why?" 'Because it ins getting a little rusty." QUIT ESS (Continued from Pago One.) "But a subsidy alone will not make a lino a success," lie said. "Let tho United States Government pass a hill like the Chineso prohibitive immigra tion enactment or the discouraging measure now in force with regard to the Japanese. Let these -companies suffer the loss of their emmicrant traffic and you will see their vessels tied up for lack of support. "What has tho United States cov crnmeut dono for us? Within a short period we were fined $421,000 for In fractions of the many regulations with which we have recently been hedged about Of this amount we paid some ?2GO,000, having managed to secure a reduction of tho original amount T,Now we have, had our entire carry ing trade our traffic taken away from us through the operations of the Interstate Commerce Commission How? Why, wo are now obliged to give .thirty days' notice of any change In rates. Other lines, not of registry here, can change their rates at any tlmo without notice, 'thus, when they lower their rates we are obliged under heavy penalty to give notice of our in tention to change ours in thirty days. Then, just three days before the month expires, our cut is met by a lower one.'! Then our books are always subject to inspection. Wo have about two ex pert accountants and half a dozen sleuths going over them all the time to find evidence of rebates. "The foreign lines, with their books far away from here, not subject to the same regulation, do as they please with regard to theso things, and the result Is that wo have suffered a loss of from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 while our rivals have added somo $5,000,000 to their transportation. That Is the plain, hard fact. That Is the way tho United States treats its shipping. "I can tell you now that our charter lapses on April ICth next and It is a very serious question whether the charter will be revived. Wo are going backward. There is nothing for us to gain under present conditions. About nineteen vessels will In all probability soon be tied up In San Francisco har bor, as are those already 01 tho Aus tralian service, becauso ot tho fact that they cannot ho mado to earn money as wo aro now being treated. "It's all tommy-rot to talk about sentimentally over tho Amorican mer chant marine. Wo can't view tho mer chant marine from a sentimental ttandpoint. Tho man who can do us good is not tho man who is going to deliver us with the big stick and an atmosphero of moonshine and splen dor. "Pardon me it I speak forcefully. It is hard, after ilfteen years of hard, ot fectlvo work, to bo on tho verge of losing ono's job, and that for some thing over which ho has no supervi sion. The idea that Mr. Hill or Mr, irarriman or Mr. Huntington should build ships and maintain them if tho project will not pay them, is all uon sense. If a man cannot mako money Investing it in steamships ho certainly will not put out his money that way." Editorially tho San Francisco Chro nicle of tho 2Gth says: "RIL P.
