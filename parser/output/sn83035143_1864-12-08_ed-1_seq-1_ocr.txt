VIVID PICTURE OF SHERMAN'S PROGRESS. The Adventures of a Skedaddling Rebel Legislator. One of the reM legislators that fled from MilleJgbvillo, thus describes his ei priencts aftor reachinir Katonton. They ' iimmh a good rictureof Georgia lifo un. der the reign of Mm.t General Sherman : We found Katonton si;ita(ed.: The streets were throungod with horsemen, some moving out to lock for the ncmy ar:a some pruaenuy moving ine otnar way. The windows and pi-zr.as were lined with ladies and children, many of the former, and all the latter very pretty, and all dreading the advent of the vile vandals, wnose despicable cnaracier is beet lllus. trated in thefa:t that they are a terror to tfee helpless. A village waiting lor the Yankees is a picture worthy a Hogarth. Leaving cur baggage, we took a hasty dinner, determined to keep the road to Jkladison until our pickets snouid ; notify us of the approach of the Yankees. I About three o'clock a scout came dashing down the road at a Gilpin speed, crying,,. "To the woods ! to the woods ! ' and ut woeoi. After waitiug several hours in the rain. under a rail pen, improvised for the occa sion, we uelermined to go out on the road to Bee what was going on. We had not travelled a hundred ysrds before a party of cerulean clad equestrians came dashing up, and in a very polite manner briefly re quested us to halt. - The rfn'i&'t was ac companied with most signiiicant cocking of carbines and pistols, which, brought to a horizontal attitude in one's front, are very per.-uasivrf, etpeviauy 10 an unarmed civil ian, anil we naltcd. Alter a brief and hur ried talk, in which we wero questioned very closely about tho country, troops in the vicinity, &e, they drove on ; we gath ered from their actions that they were the ii i...- ,4 vf ih ivrce irom Madison, and wire sporting to meet another force from Monticello at the fork noar by. Ap prehending that our overcoaU and small residue of cab, and other personal eifocta, would not be safe in the motly crew corn pricing the Yankee army, we resolved to kep the woods until they should pass. We therefore retrracd to our (en and staid until morning. We then proceeded through the woods, within hearing dis tance of the Toad. Late on Sunday their main column com menced pacsing, and we found it very difficult to avoid them. They swarmed through the fields, shooting cattle and plundering indiscriminately until late in the night. "We were more in dread of being shot as bushwhackers than we had of bring plundered, and probably should have kept the road; but we now had no chc U' but to avoid them if possible. Their were rumbling along the Monti- roilo road on our left and on tne Madison road on the right, while they swarmed in the country between. We could hear them talk and hear tbeir caps explode as they paped within a few itot of us. The night whs intensely cold, wet fcnd dirk, sve when the distant gleam of a burning house iighted up the horizon. Thc-ir main ci lunins were passing frcm about Awo o'clock on Sunday afternoon until about nine oVlock at niht. The next day they Wire posing during the morning, and we cor tinned in the wood?. This was on tho thi;d day out, dnrirg which time it had raii.ed continually, and we hud subsisted on parebtd corn. Un Tuesday morning we determiued to take, tho road and push on. Going to llcCrcdio's place we found his fire hmse in ashes and his gin-house burned, and every horse and mule gone, in his lot there were about one hundred cattle lying dead. They looked like good stock, and were evident:y killed to deprive the planter of them. Proceeding on we ioand every plantation 03 the road similarly desolated, except that no other dwelling houses were burned until we reached the line mansion of Hon. Joshua HilL Prouabiy the Hill who ran against Brown for Governor of Georgia. This is a perfect wreck ; a large gin-houM full of coUrn, corn-cribs, dwelling, all a smouldering ruin. His loss was gre ter than that of any planter in this section. Besides the cotton, several thousand bushels of corn, potatoes, toveral hundred of wheat, and murh other val uable property, with every horeo and mulo, and mar.y negroes, ere gone.

The St. Louis BepubUcan tells this story a brave woman : "On the night ef the 12th instant four armed men went to the residonco of J udgo John Gillett, who lives in Carro'l county, some nine miles west of Brunswick, and demanded admittance. Only Mr;. Gillett, little daughter of thirteen years, and five youcger children were at home. Mr. Gillett demanded of the men to know who they were and what they wanted. They replied that they were 'federals' and want- el to get any arms and money that niijrht be in the housa Mrs. Gillett reached. them an old pistol through the door, bir't refused to admit them unless thev woild say who they were. They then threaten to break in. The lady told tneK. to do that if thev dared. Meanwhile she hsd armed herself with .a cup of hot water, while her little daughter had secured a corn knife and another' cup of hot water, preparatory to delending her castle from assault. I'ne rascals at once proceeded to break down the door, and succeeded in getting it partially open, when Mrs. Gillett threw the hot water at them. Whether hitting him Or not she did not know, but they withdrew, cursing this unexpected weapon defenoe. One tf them then approached window in another room of the house and commenced smashing it in, calling to the men in the house to come out. and dared any one to put his head cut. Mrs. uu.ett said mere was ne man in tba houfe. and she did not intend to put her head out. All this while the thieving rascals were threatening to break in, while Mrs. Gillett' with a courage rare'v met with. dared them to enter her house upon their peril, finally, they cot on their horses and rode off, leaving this brave-biartel woman mistiess of her home and a courage piotectress of her six little ihildrt-a.

H. THOMAS Major General Commanding. All sorts oi news pervaded the city when the news that a Hag of truce had come in. Tbe general supposition was that Hood had demanded the surrender of the city. Generals AUlroy and rcosseaa are at Murfreesboro, which is amply garrisoned and defended against any rebel force which may attack it lesterday a DOdy oi re eels attacked block-houses six and seven, near Mur freesboro. They were gallantly fought by the garrison, and soon a body cf troops, sent by Milroy from Murfreesboro, arriv ed, who attacked the rebels with such eff!Ct thtt they were driven eff in confu sion, loiing six pieces of artillery and a number of prisoners. Matters at the frer.t to-day are quieter than usual. No artillery, that can be seen hvet been placed in position fcytie rebels.

We have some additional items from rebel sources, showing how the fright, at Sherman's approach to the sea coast ' spreading in Georgia and South Carolina. All tbe officials, civil and military, have issued fierce and feverish proclamations, caliiing on every male, old and young, ahle to shoulder a musket, to report im mediately for duty. Tbe Mayors of Savannah and Charles ton, as well as the rebel army cfS -ers com manding in those places, have i.tued to their already terrified eommunitk a. doca men'.s of this character probably by this means, adding considerabl to the panic. Governor Brown, of Georgia, hss issued three more proclamations on the crisis, but Charleston, according to the Republican that city, even these stirring papers do not brine out the citizens, for it appears that a military guard has to go around the town and drag them tut of their hiding p'aces.
