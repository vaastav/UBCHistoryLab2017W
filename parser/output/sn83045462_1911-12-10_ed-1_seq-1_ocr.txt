To hold a distorted mirror up to great men and show them there reflected in travestied but not unkindly fashion; to paraphrase politics, if you please, and to speed many a winged shaft of wit into j toe bull's-eye of comment on public affairs is within the province of a Gridiron Club's dinner. This was exemplified { In the first dinner of the season given by j the club last night at the New Willard, to the apparent amusement of a company of distinguished guests. The diners, to tlie number of some 230, guests and hosts, filed into the great banquet hall, the ITesident of the United States escorted by the vice president of the club, !x>uis Garthe, leading the way, while the Marine Band played an appropriate inarch.

AMOUNT MUST BE GIVEN Real Consideration, Not Fictitious, According to Measure. i WILL BE HELP TO ASSESSOR I i Official Then Has Opinion of Both Buyer and Seller Is Argument Advanced. I !A bill that !b liable to cause considerable commotion in local real esj tate circles was Introduced in the HflllRP UPStPrdn v hv rhnirmon Tr.hn . son of the District committee. It requires, in brief, that in all deeds, mortgages and deeds of trust recorded in the District of Columbia j the "real consideration*' must be stat- j ed. The measure is intended to aid J the board of assessors of the District j in their work of placing accurate and proper valuations tipon Improved and unimproved property. The following explanation of the bill was given out upon its introduction by Representative Henry George, a member of the House District committee: "Too frequently in the District the real consideration is not recited In deeds of conveyance. Often a con- ! sideration of only $1 is given as the price paid for a parcel of ground, when the newspapers state that $100,000 or $200,000 was paid instead of the traditional "one dollar." Help to the Assessor. "If the real < onsideration Is set out In the conveyance, then the assessor has the opinion of both buyer and ! seller as to what the property is | worth. We have here entirely too many instances where property is assessed for only a very small per cent of the reported consideration paid for the property. A disclosure of the real consideration will greatly aid the assessor in his official work." Following is the text of the measure: "Hereafter it sliall be unlawful for any officer, or any of his deputies or clerks, j whose duty it is or may hereafter become, to put to record any deed of conveyance for any real estate in the District of Columbia, or to put to record any mortgage or deed of trust upon any real estate in said District, unless said deed of conveyance, mortgage or deed of trust is accompanied by a statement, subscribed and sworn to before some one authorized to administer an oath, by the grantor in deeds of conveyance. or by the mortgagee in mortgages or deeds of trust, to the effect that tne consideration, as set out in the said deed of conveyance, mortgage, deed of trust or other like recordable paper, is the entire and real consideration actually passed or to be passed. Provision for Liens. "Neither shall any consideration greater that that fully expressed In the conveyance. mortgage or deed of trust, be or become a lien upon the property described in the said paper. "Neither shall any consideration for the execution of any such aforesaid paper, which is greater than the consideration mentioned therein, be collectible in any court of law or equity. "Any person who shall swear falsely in making tlie statement herein provided for shall be deemed guilty of perjury and subject to all the penalties imposed by law for that offense. "Any recording officer who shall violate the provisions of this act shall, upon conviction, be removed from office; and, in addition thereto, pay a fine of $HX>.

Peter P.oyd, a well know n member of the Philadelphia bar and president of the Tradesmen Trust t'otnpany of this city, ( which went into the hands of a rc- j reiver about two months ago, shot and killed himself today in his law ofliees on the thirteenth iloor of an office building.

The j trust company closed Its doors Sep-1 tember 18 In a statement to the do- ; positors Mr. Boyd said that inability to promptly realize on certain out- i standing loans impaired the bank's: ilnancial condition and promised to pay ; depositors dollar for dollar.

KEEPS WESECRET Details of Russia's Advance on Persia Not Made Known. ENGLAND'S DELICATE PLACE Fears to Take Hand Because of Possible War With Germany. SHUSTEK HELD RESPONSIBLE Believe He Is Efficient and Has Onnrl Intentions, But Not Considered Diplomatic. LONDON. December {*.?Details as t<> the advance of the Russian troops In Persia liave been kept for several days completely in the dark How large a force has been dispatched by the Russian government and particulars as to i its movements are unknown Jn London, but the public generaJly feel that the end will be that the establishment of a Russian protectorate over the best parts of Persia, Including two northern capitals, Tabriz and Teheran. Newspapers and politicians generally regard It as unlikely that Russia, oni? entrenched In Teheran, will ever withdraw. The Teheran correspondent of the Times predicts that Russia's first act will be to substitute a new form of government for that of the national council. Blow to British Prestige. Possible damage to British commercial Interests is absorbing much attention, but the blow to British prestige among orientals causes most anxiety. The Outlook says: "We are face to face with one of the gravest crises in the history of British policy in Asia '' The Nation says: "It means the worst blow which our prestige could suffer in the east. We appear as the weak partner. who dares not try to check his powerful and unscrupulous associate." Blame Placed on Shuster. W. Morgan Shuster, the American treasurer general in Persia, whose dismissal was demanded by Russia, is held responsible for bringing the Persian troubles to a crisis. He has been one of the most discussed men in England during the last week. All officials as well as the newspapers credit him with efficiency and good intentions, but accuse him of lacking diplomatic tact. The British cabinet is trying to Induce Russia to abate her demands, but the crux of the matter is the tension with Germany, which overshadows all other considerations. England needs Russia's support in case of a war with Germany, and therefore cannot afford to take a stand against her. DISSOLVING TOBACCO TBUST. son county circuit court decree today sustained the right of State Revenue Agent Adams to collect delinquent back taxes from naval stores corporations, about twenty in number, aggregating more than 11,000,000.

SCHEME TO CHECK WILSON. Plans of New Jersey Republicans to Pass Vetoed Bills. TRENTON, N. J., December ?.?The steering committees of the republican senators and assemblymen met in joint connreiicc ai tile statehoufe today to discuss the party program for the coming session of the legislature. In a general way it was decided to carry out the pledges that were embodied in the republican state platform during the fall campaign It was decided to a!so recommend to the senate and house caucuses that the plan of adjournment by followed, which would prevent the governor from acting upon a large batch of bills after the legislature had adjourned for the year. In accordance with this, after a session of the usual length, a temporary adjournment will be had for two or three weeks and then the two houses will reconvene and act upon any bills the governor in the meantime may have vetoed. In New Jersey the legislature may pass bills over the governor's veto by a majority .vote, so that any bill vetoed by j Gov Woodrow Wilson may be repassed by the republicans if they so desire.

FEATURES OF T FAILING TO GET JOB. ENDS HIS OWN LIFE C. 0. North Disappointed When Congressman Does Not Employ Him. i ??????? An unfavorable response to an application for employment received yesterday from a member of Congress, it is believed, was the last of a series of setbacks that led Charles O. North, a Spanish war veteran, to end his life last night by inhaling illuminating gas. North was found dead in bed in his room at the house of H. W. Quinn. 1227 O street northwest, shortly after a o'clock, about five hours after he received the disappointing message. A note he is thought to have written several days ago was found in a bureau drawer in his room. It reads: "If the pains are tolerable, 1 will bear- them, but if they are intolerable i 1 will not have to bear them long." Mrs. Quinn handed North the message from the representative alrout noon. He | seemed greatly disappointed at the contents of the communication and went to his room. That was the last time the young man was seen alive. His body was taken to the morgue last ntght, and Coroner Nevltt, after an investigation. issued a certificate of suicide. Was an Engineer. North was an engineer and had worked at the Woodward apartment house from' May until September. Since September he had not l>eeu employed, and Illness and failure- to get. employment made him de! spondent. The fleceased, who was thirty-five years old, had told Mr. Quinn that he served in a Colorado regiment during the Span: ish-Amertcan war, and that last year ho spent some time in the i-onvalescent camp at Nashville. Tenn., coming from that place to this city. A sister of the deceased, it is stated, lives at Walla Walla, Wash., and other relatives live at Latimer, Iowa, where he lived after the close of the war. The police will niako an effort to communicate with his relatives and advise them of his death. If they axe not found, it is likely that the body will be Interred at Arlington by the Spanish War Veterans. GETS UNWELCOME FREEDOM. ! Patrick Kiernan Will Soon Be Released From Sing Sing.

CHICAGO, December 0.?The fust suspicion of an attempt to tamper with the jury which is to try the ten Chicago beef i packers made its appearance today when IM. Veale, a venireman from Malta, III., ! told the court that he had been "spoken ! tr>" In the corridors of the Federal bulld| inc. Veale created a sensation when he declared that a Springfield tnan had ap: proached him and attempted to talk to him concerning his opinions in the case. An investigation was started immediately, but the man was not located. Veale said that he repulsed the man, and was . unahle to give an accurate description of ; him. "A man came up to me and asked me if 1 had been summoned as a Juror," said the talesman. "1 told him that I i had been, and he asked me whether I j had an opinion.

May Not Be Jury Tampering. i "It looked a little queer, hut may have been merely a passing incident," said District Attorney Wilkerson. "Veale cou.d not describe the man, so there is little chance of finding him. However, the Jury will be carefully guarded to prevent a repetition of the j oci'urrenee." Wlien the session closed at noon today the defense had practically selected eleven jurors after putting them over the difficult educational hurdles. Attorneys for i the puckers cominueu to appiy i?ychic | tests to tne jurors to determine their ae- ' curacy of observation and the analytical poweis of their minds. Of the eleven men apparently satisfactory to the defense six are of the original twelve tendered by the government and are certain of being accepted. Defense in First Challenge. The defense used its first peremptory challenge today to be rid of John I>. Brown, a contractor, tendered by the government. Brown went through all the tests Attorneys Payne and Miller couid devise, but they seemed afraid of him. Alonzo Kelley, one of the jurors who has puzzled the court and been the source of considerable perplexity to the indicted packers because of Ills brilliantly evolved replies to questions, was peremptorily challenged by the defense after he refused to state whether or not he had a fixed opinion. The name of Senator Kenyon, who will act as advisory counsel for the government. was brought Into the case when Kdward P. Skene, a land expert for the Illinois Central railroad, said that he knew the senator, as well as members of j the counsel for each side. He was left In the box tonieht. J. Ogden Armour and Edward Tilden led a delegation of seven of the ten packers into the courtroom just as the session oipened. The four days of the trial have begun to wear on the packers, and all took the proceedings more seriously than OA previous days. 5 V\ E GRIDIRON atTB.

F. T. Gates Takes Similar ^ Ground and Lays Stress on til? VptrarHon J NEW YORK, December 9.?John D.

Mr. Rockefeller's letter, iated at Pocantico Hills, December 0, and iddressed to Chairman Stanley, reads: "Dear Sir: The narration of Leonidas I ind Alfred Merrltt before your committee vas In substance the repetition of state- | nents made by them in a controversy j 1 dosed fifteen years ago.

I "Sixteen years ago the Merritts swore ' to these charges. Just as positively as they did before your comm.ttee. Then they signed a retraction of the whole thing. They acknowledge that retraction. "By those who believe in me, no denial before your committee is needed. | By those who believe in tiie Merritts no i testimony from me is needed to sub- , itantiate the Merritts' own acknowledged retraction. "To be sure, the Merritts now swear Jiat the retraction was not true.

Confronted With Retraction. 1 "When Leonidas Merritt, while testifying before your committee, was unexpectedly confronted with that fatal re- 1 traction, it is interesting to observe liis i confusion. The official record lies before me. He first blurted right out that it i was agreed between the attorneys that the thing signed should never be recorded; that it was to be kept secret be.ween :he parties. Did Mr. Merritt c^nie down j !rom Duluth to testify before your com- < mittee, supposing that that secret docu- ' ment would not confront him? If so, lie i r forgot that it was one of the very condl:lons agreed upon that the retraction night be published. j "I am interested to note that a few nio-' v nents later, the chairman interrupted toe ^ estirnony to make the following state- r nent: 0 " 'These gentlemen objected very strentously to coming before this committee; lid not want to talk with me, and begged v ae not to bring them here.' "No wonder. o "The story of the Merritts was contra- d ticted by Mr. Rockefeller and myself in c he United States circuit court in Duluth, r inder oatli and upon cross-examination.
