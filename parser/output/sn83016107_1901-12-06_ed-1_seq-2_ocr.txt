ELECTION CONTESTS. The recent talk of the Republicans about contesting the seats of the Democrats who have been returned elected members of the Legislature will doubtless re-act as a boomerang upon those who started the discus sion. The Democrats are holding under advisement the practicability of filing petitions for recounts in a large number of cases. Careful in vestigation has shown that, while the Republicans have been raising all the hue and cry about only Republi can ballots being rejected, it turns out in point of fact that the number of spoiled Democratic tickets is al most equally as large. In many cases, especially in Cecil county, where there was any doubt as to whether or not a ticket should be counted, the tendency was to lean towards the Republican contention in the case. Senator Crothers has been returned as being 199 votes behind his op ponent, Henry M. McCullough, and it is claimed that a recount would develop different results. In Balti more the majority of Senator Putzel is only slight and it would require but very little change to elect his Democratic opponent. A contest will probably also be made iu Somerset county where the result is exceedingly close. The Democrats cannot be blamed for making advantage of these re counts after the way that the Repub lican party has acted since the election. There was a disposition on the part of the dominant party to let the election day settle all matters in dispute and stand or fall by the official returns that were made up by the judges of the different election precincts ofthe State. This was not in accordance with Senator McComas’ liking; and hehascaused to be spread broadcast throughout the country the charges that there were gross election frauds from one end of the State to the other. If his assertions are to be believed Maryland must be as strongly Republican as Penn sylvania. No doubt she would be, if her election law was the same and administered by officials who owe their political creation to Senator Matthew Stanley Quay. It is the desire of every well-think ing person that the will of the ma jority of the voters of this State shall be respected. If a majority of the legal ballots cast at the election shows that the Fsepublicans are en titled to i he seats that the)- are now claiming, they should have them. On the other hand, however, if a re count shows that the Democrats have a majority of the legal votes cast, the committees should not hesi tate to seat them. We must confess that we were somewhat disappoint ed when the face of the returns show ed that the Democrats would not have a majority sufficient to pass the call for the proposed Constitutional Convention. It was our constant aim throughout the campaign to aid all that we could to bring about this result. But as sincerely as we desire to see the call for the new con vention pass, yet we earnestly op pose any movement looking to the unseating of members to bring about this result unless it is the will of the voters of the State. Like rpany other Democrats we will welcome a recount and be willing to stand or fall by its results. Politics should beconducted like other ordinary business affairs of life and we only ask that such steps should be taken as are not only within the letter, but the spirit of law. PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT’S MESSAGE. President Theodore Roosevelt com m unicated his first annual message to Congress on Tuesday. It contained no surprises, theoutlineshavingbeen intimated for some little time past in the recent press dispatches from Washington. It is a voluminous document and will probably be read at length by but few persons. It at tempts to deal upon almost every subject on which the President deems it is necessary for Congress to take action and this has necessarily con sumed a large amount of space. It would seem in these busy times it would be better, in order that the Chief Executive might havehis views discussed by the people at large, that he have a summary of the paper made which could be given to the public, while the details of his ideas could he communicated directly to Congress who alone are supposed to pass upon his suggestions. The message opens with a eulogy upon the character of Mr. McKinley and dwells at length upon the public and domestic virtues of the twenty-fifth Chief Executive. He calls attention to the fact that of the last seven elected Presidents Mr. McKinley is the third who has been murdered. Comment is made upon the fact that in the previous assassinations the murderers had some supposed motive on which to base their action, while in the case of Mr. McKinley the only cause whk+i can lie atwrited tor the deed was the hatred which the An archists bear against the heads of all civilized Governments. He dwells at large upon the dangers of Anarchy and suggests that remedial legislation should be passed which would give the Federal Courts the right to punish any one who should take the life or attempt to kill the President or any man who by law is in the line of succession for the Presidency, and that the punishment for an attempted assault should be proportionate to the enormity of the offense against our public institutions. He compli ments the strength of the Government in regard to the position it was placed immediately after the commission of the crime. “The people would have torn him( the assassin (limb from limb if it had not been that the law he defied was at once invoked in his behalf. So far from his deed being aimed on behalf of the people against the Government, the Government was obliged at once to exert its full police power to save him from instant death at the hands of the people. More over, his deed worked not the slightest dislocation in our Govern mental system and the danger of a recurrence of such deeds, no matter how great it would grow, would work only in the direction of strengthening and giving harshness to the forces of order. No man will ever be restrained from becoming President by any fear as to his personal safety. If the risk to the President’s life became great it would mean that the office would more and more come to be filled by men of a spirit which would make them reso lute and merciless in dealing with every friend of dishonor. This great country will not fall into Anarchy and if Anarchists should ever become a serious menace to its institutions they would not merely be stamped out, but would involve in their own ruin ever} 1 active or passive sympa thizer with their doctrines. The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame.” The subject of anti-trust legislation is handled in a very cautious manner. From the President’s previous utter ances on this important matter the foes of the illegal aggregation of money had hoped that he would take strong and unequivocal grounds against the corporate greeds. How ever, as this criticism is intended to be entirely non-partisan we will pass by without further discussing the matter. He warns against any thoughtless action and points out the dangers of haste and endeavors to show that industrial corporations have a good side as well as a bad side. On one point however, he does unloosen himself and that is theevils of over-capitalization. He expresses the mild opinion that trusts should b'e supervised and controlled within limits. Mr. Roosevelt thinks that the time has now approached when an ad ditional cabinet portfolio should be established, which would have au thority to deal directly with our commerce and industries and that the question of trusts should be put in charge of this branch of the public service. All contests between labor and capital should also be embodied within the scope of its authority. He expresses the greatest interest in the welfare of the wage earner. “If the farmer and the wage earner are well off it is absolutely certain that all others will be well off too.” He re commends the re-enactment of the law excluding Chinese labor and to strengthen it wherever necessar3 T in order to make its enforcement entire ly effective. He also recommends that the eight hour law for Govern ment labor be strictly enforced so far as practicable. He says that the great secret of suc cess of American wage earners is that they work with their heads as well as their hands. Moreover, they take a keen pride in what they are doing so that independent of reward they wish to turn out a perfect job. This is the great secret of success in competi tion with the labor of foreign coun tries. “The chief feature in the success of each man —wage worker, farmer and capitalist alike —must ever be a sum total of his own individual qualities and abilities.” He also recognized the wisdom of labor unions. The President calls attention to our present immigration laws and says that they are unsatisfactory and need changing. He also recommends the exclusion of the densely ignorant as they are so potent in producing envy, suspicion, malignant passion and hatred of order out of which Anarchistic sentiment inevitably springs. Both the educational and economic tests in a wise immigration law should be designed to protect and elevate the general body politic and social. On the subject of tariff, the Presi dent favors the pursuance of the line mapped out by the predecessors of his party. “The first requisite to our pros perity is the continuity and stabil ity of this economic policy. Nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time ***. Our experience in the past has shown that sweeping revisions ofthe tariff are apt to produce condi tions closely approaching panic in the business way. Yet it is not only pos sible but eminently desirable to com bine with the stability of our economic system, a supplementary system of reciprocal benefit, an ob ligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an incident and result of the firm establishment and preser vation of our present economic policy.” On the subject of merchant marine, the President is unequivocally in iavxir of the passage of Uw subsidy bill. “At present, America is under certain great disadvantages when put in competition with the shipping of foreign countries. Many of the fastest foreign steamships at a speed of fourteen knots or above, are sub sidized and all our ships, sailing ves sels and steamers alike, cargo carriers of slow speed and mail carriers of high speed, have to meet the fact that the original cost ofbuilding American ships is greater than is the case abroad. That the wages paid Ameri can officers and seamen are very much higher than those paid the officers and seamen of foreign competing countries and that the standard of living on the ships is far superior to the standard of living on the ships of our commercial rivals. Our Govern ment should take such action as will remedy these inequalities.” He dismisses the money question with a short paragraph f endorsing the wisdom of the passage of the act which establishes gold as the com mercial basis of this country and speaks in high praise of our credit with the civilized world. He urges a reduction of the inter nal revenue law so as to bring the receipts within the limits of our actual needs. The Inter-State Commerce Act, he believes, is not beingenforced as its framers intended that it should be. “The railway is a public servant, its rates should be just to, and open to all shippers alike. The Govern ment should see too that within its jurisdiction this is so and should pro vide a speedy, inexpensive and effec tive remedy to that end.” He urges the protection of Ameri can forests and says that the Govern ment should build irrigation works. The land reclaimed by them should be reserved for actual settlers and the cost of construction so far as possible be repaid by the land reclaim ed. On the subject of insular possessions the message is quite verbose. He thinks that in some cases the Gov ernment has been too kind in the treatment of its new subjects and that a sterner hand should hold them in check until they have in a measure learned to govern themselves. On the matter of self-government he says: “What has taken us thirty generations to achieve we cannot ex pect to see another race accomplish out of hand, especially when large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Philippine people we must show both patience and strength, forebearance and stead fast resolution.” He recommends that a pension should be given to aid the Macabebes, who have been con spicuous for their courage and de votion to the flag. He also urges immediate action towards connect ing this country with a direct cable across the Pacific to the Philippines and points in Asia. The Isthmian Canal and the Mon roe Doctrine are treated jointly as they go together hand in hand. He urges the adoption of the recent treaty with Great Britain which takes the place of the old Clayton— Bulwer treaty, so long recognized as inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American canal. The Monroe doctrine should be the cardi nal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas as it is of the United States. Just seventy-eight years have passed since President Monroe in his annual mes sage announced that “The American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future col onization by any European power.” In other words that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non-American Power at the expense of any American Power on American soil. He urges that that the work of in creasing the Navy be continued. “No one point of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this to the honor and material well fare and above all to the peace of our Nation in the future. Whether we desire it or not we must henceforth recognize that we have international duties no less than international rights, even if our flag were hauled down in the Philippines, and Porto Rico, even if we decided not to build the Isthmian Canal we should need a thoroughly trained navy of adequate size or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the idea that our Nation is among those whose sons goes down to the sea in ships, unless our commerce is always to be carried in foreign bottoms, we must have warcraft to protect it.” He also urges the highest efficiency iu American seamanship. For the Army, he considers the standing army as being large enough at present and is opposed to raising volunteer militia, which he regards as obsolete and worthless. “That the army is not at all a mere instru ment of destruction has been shown during the past three years. In the Philippines, Cuba and Porto Rico it has proved itself a great construction force, a potent implement for the up building of a peaceful civilization.” He praises both internal and inter national Expositions and recom mends their encouragement by the Government in every legitimate way. He also urges that the Census office lie made a permanent bureau as this would insure better, cheaper and more satisfactory work in the in terest not only of our business but of statistics, economic and social science. The postal service is also discussed and the free delivery system is especially praised. He indirectly favors its extension to all rural com munities. After touching on other matters of more or less importance including the Chinese question the message is closed with a glowing tribute to the late Quoen Victoria. A 

HOME COLLEGE COURSE. The Saturday Evening Post, of Phila delphia, announces two new departments which will challenge the interest ofyoung men and women throughout the country. “A Home College Course,” as one of them is called, has tieen designed to meet the wants of ambitious young people who have not had the advantages of a university training. This course will be conducted by a special faculty, composed of professors in leading colleges. The studies have been most carcfnlly chosen. Each will be treated in an interesting way, and helpful hints for outside read ing freely given. “To the Young Man Beginning Busi ness” is the second of these new depart ments. In it the most successful men in a dozen occupations will write about what helped them to the front in their own business, and gave a list of books and magazines liearing upon it. Their purpose will be to tell the beginner how he can make himself more valuable to his employers. These new departments will begin early in January, and will be made a permanent feature of The Evening Post. HOME AMD CHILD Does your horse “feel his oats" f What a difference be tween the grain-fed and the grass-fed horse! The first strong and full of ginger, the second flabby, weak and tired out before he begins. The feeding makes the difference. Children are not alike either. One is rosy, bright-eyed, full of life and laughter, another is pale, weak and dull. The feed ing again is responsible. Sickly children need special feeding. They don’t “feel their oats". Scott’s Emulsion adds just the right richness to their diet. It is like grain to the horse. The child gets new appetite and strong digestion. Scott’s Emulsion is more than food.
