In the public Interest, over the»« great corporations have to contend against twu sets of enemies, who. though nominally opposed to one another, are really allies In preventing a proper solution of the probten». There are, first, the hi g corporation men, and the extrem- Individualists among busi ness mtn, who genuinely bel lev*- In ut terly unregulated business that Is. In the reign of plutocracy: and. second, the men who. being blind to the econom ic movements of (ha day. believe | n a movement of repression rather than of regulation of corporations, and who de nounce both the power of ths railroads ond tlia exercise of the federal power width alone can really control ths rail roads Those who believe In efficient na tional control, on ths other hand, do not in ths least object to combinations: do not tn the least object to concentration lu »»usines* administration. On the con trary. they favor both, with the all-tmpor* tant proviso that there shall bs such pub licity about their workings, and such horoughgoitig control over them, as to Insure their being In the Interest, and t against the Interest, of the general bile. We do not object to the concen tration of wealth and administration, but do believe 1n the distribution of the ilth In profits to the real owners, and in securing to the public the full benefit the concentrated administration. W« believe that with concentration In ad ministration there cm come both the advantage of s larger owncshlp and of a more equitable distribution of profits, and at the same time « hotter service to the commonwealth We believe that tho dmlnlstruilon should be for the benefit f the maty; and that greed and ras ai H y , practiced on a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as If practiced or. a small scale. We do not for n moment believe that the problem will be solved hy any short and easy method. The solution will corns only hy pressing various concurrent remedies Rome of these remedies must outside the domain of all government, ne must lie otitald* the domain of the federal government. Hut there Is leg Islstlon which the federal government lone can enact and which Is absolutely liai In order to secure the attainment sf our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the na tional government of the great Interstate corporation*, including a simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short-time franchises for all corporations engaged In public business; Including the corporations which get power from water rights. There should he national as well as state guardtan»htp of mines ami forests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to should con currently h* enacted Into law. To accomplish this, means s certain In crease In the use of not the creation of power, by ths central government. The power already exists; It does not have to be created: the only question Is whether It shall he used or left Idle— ami meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain Idle. The danger to Amer ican democracy lies not In the least In Ihe concentration of administrative power In responsible and accountable hands. it lies In having the |m»w©i Insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for Its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account. Democracy Is In peril wherever the administration of po litical power Is scattered among a variety of men who work In secret, whose very names are un known to the common people H Is not In peril from any matt who derives au thority from the people, who exerefees It in sight of the people, anti who Is from time to time compelled to give an account of Its exercise to the people.

It Is humiliating that at Kuropean in ternational congresses on accidents the United Htates should he singled out as ths most belated among th© nations in r«*spect to smployers* liability legisla tion. This government Is Itself s large employer of labor .and In it* dealings with Its employes It should set a stan dard In this country which would place It on a par with ths most progressive countries In Rurope. The laws of the United Htates In this respect and the laws of Kuropean countries have been summarized In a recent bulletin of the bureau of labor, nnd no American who read* this summary can fall to he struck hy the great contrast b»*tween our practices and theirs a contrast not In any sense to nur credit. I renew my recommendation made In a previous message that half-holidays be granted during summer to all wage workers In government employ . I also renew my recommendation that the principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practi cable be extended to t^e entire work being carried on by tne government; the present law should bo amended to embrace contracts on those public work* which the present wording of ths not seems to exclude. Would Double Salaries of Judge«. I moat earnestly urge upon the con gress the duty of Increasing the totally Inadequate salurles now given to our Judges On the whole there Is no body of public servants who do ns valuable work, nor whose moneyed reward Is so Inadequate compared to their work. Be ginning with the sifpreme court the lodges should have their salaries dou bled. It Is not befitting tho dignity of ths nation that Its most honored public servants should he paid sugis so small compared to what they would earn In private life that ths performance of public service hy them implies an ex ceedingly heavy pecuniary sacrifice. It la earnestly to be desired that some method should he devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain In the administration of Justice, and which operate with peculiar sever ity against persons of small means, and favor only the very criminals whom It Is most desirable to punish These long delays in the final decisions of cases make In the aggregate a crying evil; and a remedy shout i he devised. Much of this Intolerable delay Is due to Improper regard paid to technicali ties which are a mere hlnderance to Justice. In some noted recent cases this over-regard for technicalities has re sulted In a striking denial of Justice, and fYagrant wrong tb th* body politic. Labor Leaders Criticised. At the l^iftt election certain leaders of organised'labor made n violent und »weeping attack upon the entire judi ciary of the country, an attack couched In such term* a* to include the most upright. honest and broad-minded Judges, no less than those of narrower ittind and more restricted outlook Last year, before the house com mittee on Judiciary. these same labor leaders formulate«} their de mand*. specifying * the bill that contained them, refusing all compro mise. stating thev wished the principle of that hill «>r nothing They Insisted on a provision that In a labor dispute no Injunction should Issue except to protect « property right, anti specifical ly provided that the right tn carry on business should n«»t he construed ms a property right, ami In a second provis ion their bill made legal In a labor dis pute sny a«-t or agreement by or be tween two «>r more persons that wmtld not have been unlawful If done by a single person In other words, this bill legalised blacklisting and boycotting In every form, legalising, for Instance, those forms of the secondary boycott which the anthracite (joal strike com mission so unreservedly condemned; while the right tn carry on a business was explicitly taken out from under that protection which the law throws over proper!* The demand was made that there should be trial by Jury In contempt case*, thereby most seriously Impairing the authority of the court* Ml this represented a course of policy which If carried out. would mean the enthronement of class privilege In Its « • u»b m mul most brut:»W'<i m. and th© destruction of one of the most essen uul functions «>f the JudUe.iry In all civ Mil d la Th« viole «•e of th h cisistion two truth they I the a de for thin complete faillir«' which It I* «seen ild learn In tin ght to teut'h th« the worker, that h proper and Imj r* n* they ing». • Is tion un tion ' ers.

Matter» for Thought for Labor. Buch proposals a* those mentioned shove as a«1vocate»l by the extreme labor leaders, contain th© vital error of being class legislation of the most offensive kind, and even If ena< t«-d Into law I be lieve that the law would rightly bo held un onstitutlonal. Moreover, the labor people are themselves now beginning to Invoke the use of the power of injunc tion During the last ten years, and within my own knowledge, at l«*ast fifty Injunctions huve been obtained by labor unhjns In New York city alone, most of them being to protect the union label ta ' property right"), but some being ob tained for other reasons against employ ers. Injunction Muit Remain. Th© power of injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against Its abuse. In substance, provision should be made that no Injunction or temporary re straining order Issue otherwise than on notice, except where Irreparable Injury would otherwise result; an«J in such case a hearing «»n the merits of the order should he had within a short fixed pe riod, and. If not then continued after hearing, It should forthwith lapse. De cisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimized In every way. M«>reover, I believe that the procedure should be sharply doflne<b anil the Judge required minutely to state tho particulars both of his action and of his rensons therefor, wo that the congress can If It «legirss examine and Investigate the same. For many of the shortcomings of Justice In our country our people as a whole are themselves to blame, and the Judges and Juries merely bear their share together with the public as a whole. It is discreditable to us as a people that there should he difficulty In convicting fnunlcrers, or in bringing to Justice men who as public servants have been guilty of corruption, or who have profited by the c«»rruptlon of public servants The result Is equally unfortunate, whether «lue to hairsplit ting technicalities In the interpretation of law by judges, to sentimentality and cla»s consciousness on the part of Juries, or to hysteria nnd sensational ism In the dally press. For much of this failure of justice no responsibility whatever lies on rich men as such. We who make up the mass of the people cannot shift the responsibility from our own shoulders. But there Is an impor tant part of the failure watch lias spe cially to do with inability to hold to proper account men of wealth who behave badly. The Modern Corporation. Th© hug© wealth that has been accu mulated by a few individuals of recent years, tn what has amounted to a so cial and Industrial revolution, has been »is regards some of these Individuals made possible only by the improper use of the modern corporation. A certain typ«^ of modern corporation, with Its officers nnd Hgents. Its many Issues of securities. an«l Its constant consolida tion with allied undertakings, finally become! an Instrument so complex as to contain a greater number of ele ments that, under various Judicial de cisions. lend themselves to fraud and oppression than any device yet evolved In the human brain. Corporations are necessary Instruments of modern busi ness. They have been permitted to become a menace largely because the governmental representatives of the people have worked slowly in provid ing for adequate control over them. ing ( >ur great clusters of corpora tic ms. hug«* trusts a nd fabulously W« rulthy inulttmllllomilr ch. employ the V# ry best lawyers they can obtain to pl< i'k (laws lu statut« •m a fter their passage, but they also empl oy a class «»f secret agents who i seek. under the Mil Ivlce «»f experts, to rend« t hostile to leglsla Ion Innocuous by making It un constltutlonal. «»ften through the inser tion of what appear on th« ir face to he (trusttc and sweeping provisions against the Interests of th«» parties inspiring them, while th© demagogues, th© «'«ir rupt creatures who Introduce black mailing schemes to '«trik«" corp«»ra tlons. ami all who demand extreme, and undesirably radical. measures, show themselves to be the worst ene mies «»f the very public whose loud mouthed champions they profess to be H«al dnmage has been »lone by the manifold and conflicting- Interpretation* o» the Interstate commerce law.

Plea for Inland Waterway». Action should be begun forthwith, dur present sessldn of th« congress. Improvement c»f our inland water ways action which w! us not only navigabl rivers. Until th© work of river Improvement Is und»rtaken In a modern way It can not have p-sults that will meet the needs of this modern nation. r I he plan which promises the best and quick est results Is that of a per manent commission authorized to co-or dinate the work of all the government departments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution of a comprehensive plan. Under such a commission the actual work of construc tion might be entrusted to the reclama tion service; or to the military engineers acting with a sufficient number of civili ans to continue th© work in time of war; or it might he divided between the rec lamation service ami the corps «>f en gineers. Funds should be provided from •urrent revenues If It Is deemed wise — >therwise from the sal© of bonds. The îsseiiiiHl thing is that the work should go forward under the best possible plan, and with the least possible delay. The tim© for playing with our waterways Is past. The country demands results. The president urges that national parks adjacent to national forests be placed under the control of the forest service of the agricultural depart ment; he also points out the benefits derived from pure food legislation. The message continues: Needs of the Secret Service. Last year an amendment was Incor porated In the measure providing for the secret service, which provided that there should be no detalf from the secret serv ice und no transfer therefrom. The amendment In question was of benefit to no on«* excepting criminals, and It seriously hampers the government in the detection of crime und tho securing «»f Justice. The chief argument in favor of the provision was that the congressmen did not them selves wish to be investigated by the secret service men. Very little of such investigation has been don© in the past: but it is true that the work of the secret service agents was partly responsible for the indictment and conviction of a sen ator and a congressman for land frauds In Oregon. I do not believe that it in in the public Interest to protect criminals In any branch of the publi«* service, and exactly as we have again and again dur ing the past seven years* prosecuted and convicted such criminals who were in the executive branch of the government, so In my belief we should be given ample means to prosecute them if found in the h'glslative branch. But If this is not considered desirable a special exception could be made in the law prohibiting the use of the secret service force In Inves tigating members of the congress. Postal Savings Banks. I again renew my recommendation for poHtal savings banks, for deposit ing saving* with the security of the government behind them. The object 1* to encourage thrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of mod erate means. It is believed that in the aggregate vast sums of money would be brought Into circulation through the In strumentality of the postal savings banks. Parcel Post. In my lust annual message I com mended the postmaster-general's recommendation for an extension of the parcel post on the rural routes. The « stablishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the farmer and thé country storekeeper, and It Is desirable that the routes, serving more than 15,000.000 people, should be utilized to the fullest practicable extent. Education. With the limited means hitherto pro vided. the bureau of e «location has rendered efficient service, but the con gress has neglect«'d to adequately sup ply the bureau with means to meet the educational growth of the country. I earnestly recommen«! that this un fortunate state of affairs as regards the national educational office be reme died b/ adequate appropriations. Tills recommendation is urged by the repre sentatives of »»ur common schools and great state universities and the lea«iing educators, who all unite in requesting favorable consideration and action by the congress upon this subject. The president points out the neces sity of better organization of the vari ous bureaus responsible for the public health, und urges the placing of all soldiers' homes under the Jurisdiction of the war department. Statehood. On the question of statehood the president says: I a<)v«>«'nt© th© immédiat© admission of New Mexico and Arizona a* Mint©*. This should I*© done at the present session of the congress. The people of the two ter ritori.'s have mack» tt evident by their vot«»8 that they will not com© in as one state. The only alternative is to admit them ns two. and 1 trust that this will be vltln ©lav. Interstate Fisheries. I call the attention of th© «'ongr©** to the Important'«* of the problem' of the fisheries in th© Interstate waters. On the «»rest IJkt-B w© are now. under the very wise treaty of April U of this year, en deavoring to come to an International agreement f«*r the preservation and sat isfactory use of the fisheries of these wa ter* which « Lake Krle, fresh water nth« for and this pr nances In , polit! examp fisheries In rolled by ti ir states, .vine- hy i llfferent ce w ise be a. ha» the the world: e statutes une divl ileved. •Ichest 1'Ut It it two province, V» different ordi intlcu.

This nation s foreign poller Is based on the theory that right must be done between nations precisely as between Individuals, and In our actions for the last ten years we have t„ this matter proven our faith by our deeds We have behaved, and are behaving to wards other nations. .„ | n p r t vat „ lif( , an honorable man would behave to want* his f#l)ow* Latin-American Republic*.

Tn Cuba our occupancy will cease In about two months' time: the Cubans huv© in orderly manner elected their own governmental authorities, and the Island will be turned over to them. Our occu pation on this occasion has lasted a llt ti,. over two years, and Cuba has thriv en and prospered under it. Our earnest hop© and one desire Is that the people of the Island shall now govern them selves with Justice, so that peace and or der may be secure. Japanese Exposition. Th© Japanese government has post poned until 1917 the date of th<* great international exposition, the action be ing taken so as to insure ample tlmo iri which to prepare t»> make the expo sition all that It should be made. Tho American commissioners have visited Japan and the postponement will mere ly give ampler opportunity for Ameri ca to he represented at the exposition. Not since the first international expo sition has there been one of greater importance than this will be. marking, as it does, the fiftieth anniversary of the ascension to the thron«' of the em peror of Japan. The extraordinary leap to the foremost place among the nations of the world made by Japan during this half century is something unparalleled in all previous history. I take this opportunity publicly to state my appreciation of the way In which in Japan, in Australia. In New Zealand, and in all the states of South America, the battle fleet has been re ceived on its practice voyage around the world. The American government can not too strongly express its appre ciation of the abounding and generous hospitality shown our ships in every port they visited. The Army. As regards the army I call attention to the fact that while our Junior offi cers and enlisted men stand very higlu the present system of promotion hy seniority results In bringing into the higher grades many men of mediocre capacity who have but a short time to serve. No man should regard It as his vested right to rise to the highest rank in the army any more than In any other profession. It is a curious and by no means creditable fact that there should he so «»ften a failure on the part of the public and its representa tives to understand the great need, from £ie standpoint of the service and the nation, of refusing to promote re spectable. elderly incompetents. Tho higher places should he given to the most deserving men without regard to seniority; at least seniority should be treated as only one consideration. In the stress of modern Industrial com petition no business firm could succeed if those responsible for its management were chosen simply on the ground that they were the oldest people In its em ployment; yet this is the course advo cated as regards the army, and qulred by law for all grades except those of general officer. As a matter of fact all of the best officers In the highest ranks of the army are those who have attained their present posi tion wholly or in part by a process of selection The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could con sider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secure a far more rigid enforcement than at present in Hie elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this plan is recommended only if the congress does not see fit to provhie what in my judgment is far better, that is. for selection in promotion, and f»»r elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rank by a cer tain age. should be retired—for in stance. if a man should not attain field rank by the time he Is 45 should of course be placed on the re tired list. General officers should be selected as at present, and one-third of the other promotions should made by selection, the selection to be made by the president or secretary of war from a list of at least two candi dates proposed for each vacancy by a board of officers from the arm of the service from which the promotion is to be made. A bill Is now before the congress having for its object to so cure the promotion of officers to vari ous grades at reasonable ages through a process of selection, by boards of of ficers. of the least efficient for retire ment with a percentage of their pay depending upon length of service. The hill, although not accomplishing ___ that should be done, is a long step in the right «lirection; and I earnestly recommend its passage, or that more completely effective measure. National Guard. Now that'the organized militia, the National Guard, has been incorporated with th© army as a part oi the national forces. It behooves the government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect its efficiency. It should be assisted in its instruction and other wise aided more liberally than hereto fore. 1 ho continuous services of many well-trained regular officers will bo essential in this connection. A bill is now pending before the congress creating a number of extra officers in th© army, which it passed, as it ought to b©. will enable more officers to be trained a* instructors of National Guard and assigned to tjmt duty. In case of war it will be of tho utmost importance to have a large number of train«*«! officers to us© for turning raw levies into good troops. The Navy. I approve the re«'ommendations of the general board for th© in crease of the navy, calling especial attention to the need of addi tional destroyers and colliers, and above all. of the four battleships. It is de sir able to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battleships of th© best existing type. I most earnestly recommend that ths general board be by law turned into a general staff. There is literally no ex cuse whatever for continuing the pres ent bureau organization of the navy. The navy should be treat'd as a purely mili tary organization, and everything should be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. a system of promotion by nit rit. either by selec tion or by exclusion, or by both processes, should be Introduced. It ts out of the question, if the present principle of promotion by mere seniority is kept, to expect to get the best results from the higher officers Our men come' to> old. and stay for too short a time, in th« high command positions. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of th© battle fleet around th« world Th# improvement of the ships tn every way has been extraordinary, and they have gained far more experience in battle tactics than they would have I gained if they had stayed In the Atlantic waters. The American people have cau»« for profound gratification, both In vi«w of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by this cruise, and in view of the improvement the cruise has worked in this already high condition. I do not believe that there is any other service in In the world In which the axera** of char- j acier and efficiency in the enlisted men as high as Is now the case In our own. j
