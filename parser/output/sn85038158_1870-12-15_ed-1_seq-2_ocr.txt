With an acquiescence n the part of (he whole people In the national oblixatlnna to pay the public debt created as the price of our union, the pensions to oar disabled oldiers and Bailors, and their widows and orphans, and In the changes to the Con aliuition which have been mnde neeeaaarv by a great rebellion, there ia no reason why we should not advance In material prosperity and hnpplness, as no other na tlon ever did after so protracted aud Ie vaUog a war. THE WAR IN 

EUROPE. The Presiient stntes that tfoon after the war broke out our Minister in Paris was instructed to afford protection to German and other oitisens iu the French Capital, whloh duty has been satisfactorily perform ed. Ou the proclamation of a Republic In France, our Minister waa Instructed to offer the congratulations of the President and people of this country. An appesl was made to our Government to join with the European powers In efforts to restore peace. The President replied that our e tablixhed policy forbade Us to Interfere In European affairs. He add: ''Should the time come when the action of the United Suites can hasten the return of peace by a single hour, that action will te heartily taken.' 

NEUTRALITY. In vlewf the large number of persons of French and German birth living In tbi country, It was deemed prudent to lxsue a proclamation soon after war waa declared, defining the duties of the t.overomeut td iia citizen In preserving neutrality, which materially assisted ia preventing ila viola tion. j CUBA AND SPAIN. Affalrsla'Cuba have not materially chang ed since the last session of Contrress. In the early part of the contest in that island nspeoted persons were subjected to ar bitrary arrest, imprisonment, military trial and execution, and coiiflm'ication of prop erty by the Cuban authorities. As far as these proceedings effected American eitl aens they were In violation of the treaty of 1795 between Spim and this country, and our Government was compelled to appeal to Madrid f ir redrew. A Joint tribunal wss proposed for the settlement of cluim of our citizens for past violations cf the treaty, and und"r tbis proposition the -dalrn of the American ship, "Lloyd As plnwail" for illegal seizure and dctentiou by the Cubin authorities, baa been settled by an award of il9.70'.i W to the U. S. foril owners. The cluim of the American whale ship "Canada" has been settled in like manner, the British Minister, .Sir Ed ward Thornton, having acted as aibilralor, and awarded the U. S. Sl00.7t0.09 In gold, which has been paid. It is hoped that Rpain will agr-e to settle all other pending claims in the same manner, and negotia tions with thtt object are still pending. It is also claimed by our Government that in future our treaty rights shall be fullhfully res pec ted in Cuba. SPANISH AMERICAN PEACE CONFERENCE, in pnrsuance 01 n rv!i;uijn i vmii of lRfi6, nor Government offered its friend ly offices to promote piace arid harmonv between Srmin and the allied'South Ameri can Republics. A conference was held In 1r..t,l..t.tn Ontntiar OCir 1, laat at tcktirlfrl hr the Ministers of Spsiu, Pt-ru, Chili, end Ecuador, and presided over by the Secre tary of State, but owing to the absence " of any representative from Bolivia, the con ference waa pontpon-d until that Stale could be represented. 

ACQUISITION OF SAN DOMINGO. The President rc-greta the failure of the treaty for the nnnevcation of g.,n Domingo, at the last session of Con crrra anrl stuffs his thorough eonvie- r. . . ..... n .. tion that "the best interests of th eouotry, commercially ami mflterially. demanded its ratification." Time, he says, has onTy confirmed him In this view. As the is one of tho most im portant parts of this Mea?e, we copy the Preaulent'a argument eatire. He eaysr I now ffrmTy bf Iieve that tbi met- ' ment It is known that th Unitea states have entirely abandoned the proj-'ct r accepting as a part of ita territory the Island of San Domingo, the estab lishment of a free port in the B iy ol raroana, anu a iarg? ciimiiin-ii cuj wiil apring op, to whieh we will b tributary withoot rfceivirtg corres ponding benefits. The natiotiHl folly of cur rejection is apparent. Th Gov ernmeDt id San Domingo has volunta rily sought this annexation. It is weak power, numbering probably ls than one hundred aud twenty thous und souls, and yet puksepsing odo of the richest territories uudt-r the sun. entitle of supporting a population of Kn millions of poople in luxury. The people of Sin Domingo are noi eapable of maintaining themselves in their present condition, and mu.-t look fr outside support.- They yntru for the protectioa of our institutions, our Ijrogress, end ot'r Hvtlizalinn, Sliall e refuse ihem ? The acquisition Ban DomingO is desirable because l-s geogmphical position. It com, --Hiands the entrance of the Carribbtuu eea, and the isthmus transit of com merce. It possesses the richest soil, best and most capacious harbors, and most salubrious climate and the most Valuable products of the forest, mine and soil of any of the West India Isl. nds. Its possession by the U. States . will, in few years, build up acoastwis-, eommerce of Immense luagnitude, which will' go Ikr toward restorwig cur lost merchant marine. It will give ua those articles which we con- eider of great value, aod do not pro duce ; thus equalizing our exports aud Imports. In case of foreign war til give us command- of all the West India I-knd, and thus prevent an fnetny from again posessiiig himself fcf a rendi zvotw upon our coast. At preseut our coast trade,, between the States bordering on the Atlantic and tbpse bordering on the. Gulf of Mexico, is by the JJuhumas and the Anlillt'S. ' " Twice we nit'st as it were, pass through foreign countries to get by sea from fi-orgia to liie east coast pr 1 londa. hun tsi VI i ioriu.t..Dn Domirjpo, With a stuble government, wadtr which her immense resources rin be deVfclopeJ, will give reiHuneri.- live WflCPS to tens of thousands of la borers not liCW ujjou ttelcLind. This in M labor will rak advantage of every available mearm of transportation to abandon the adjacent island and seek the blessing of freedom and ita stqaenee each inhabitant receiving the rewards of his own labor. Porto Ilico and Cuba will have to abolish slavery as a meas ure of self preservation to retain their laborer." Sin Domingo will become a large consumer of the products 01 Northern farmers and manufacturers. The cheap rate at which her citizens can be furnished with food, will make it necessary that contiguous island. shotiid have thesame advantages, in order to compete In the production of ugar, coffee, tobacco, tropical iruits, Ac. This will open to us a wider market for our producis. The production, in San Domingo, ebb fly of these articles, wiil eut off more- than one hundred millions ofur annual imports, becidcr increasing our expous. "With su-li a picture it Is easy to see how our Inrae dtbt abroad is Ul timately to be extinguished. With balance of trade against us, including Interest on bonds held by foreigners, and the tnne.v shipment of our clt-iz-uis traveling in foreign l.tnds, equal o the entire yield of precious metals in this country, it is not 60 easy to see liow this result is to be otherwise ac complished. The acquisition of Sau Domingo is an adhesion to the Monroe doctrine ; h it measure of national protection - it is an assertion of our just claim to a controlling influence over the great commercial truffle aoon to flow from west tieast by way ot the Isthmus of Darien ; it is to build up cur former merchant marine ; U is to furuisli a new market for , the pro duels of our farms, shops and manufact ure ; It is to make slavery Insuppor table in Cuba aud Por(o Kico at once and ultimately so in Brazil ; it is to settle the unhappy condition of Cubu, and end an exterminating conflict ; it is to providw honest means of paying our honest debts, without over, taxing the people ; it is to furnish our citizens with the necessaries of every day life .it cheaper rates than ever before ; and i( is. in fine, a rapid stride toward that greatness which the intelligence, indus try and enterpris - of the citizens of the United States entitle this coun ry to assume among nations. - -In view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon Con gress an early expression ol its views as to the best means of acquiring fcan Dominen. My suggestion is that by joint resolution of the two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission to negotitate for a treaty with theauthorities or Han Domingo, for the acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the expense of such ommission. The question may then be determined ty the action of the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution iif annexation, as in the case of Texas. "So convinced am I of the advant iges to follow from the acquisition of San Domingo, and of the great disad vantages I might say almost calam ines to flow from non-acquisition, that 1 believe the subject has only to be investigated to be approved." THE 

ALABAMA CLAIMS. copy iii full the portion of the Mes sage relating to these claims : "I regret to say no conclusion has been reached for the adjustment of claims aj.-Hiiit Great Kritaiu growing out of the course adopted by that Government during the rebellion. The Cabinet or London, so far as ita views have been e pressed, does not Hppear to be willing to concede that her Majesty's Government was guilty of negligence. "or did permit anything during the war by which the United States had just cause of complaint. My Hnn and un allerile oouvictious are unchanged, and therefore recommend to Congress to authorize the appointment -of a commis sion to lake proof of amounts and the ownership ol these claims, on notice to (he representatives of .her Majesty at Washington ; and the.t authority be given Ur the fcptth-ment of the claims by the United Suites, feo that the (government will possess the ownership of the pri vate claims, as well as me responsibility 01 an the demands ngaiust Great Uritain, "It cannot e necessary to add that whenever her Msjesty's Government shall entertain a desire lor a Iiul ana Irienuiy aijuslment of these claim, the Lulled Slates will enler upon their consideration. wilh an enruest deire for a conclusion consistent with the houor and dlguily of both.." THE FISHERY QUESTION. of of it - The President states that the authori ties ot the "Iiomiuiou of Canada" have recently manifested an unfriendly feeling towards our fishing vessels on theit coasts, Vessels fishing within three miles of the eoasts "have been seized without notice or warning, in violation of tre custom prev iously prevailing, and have been taken into the Colonial porta, their voyages broken tip and the vessels condemned." "The statutes of the Dominion of Canada assume still broader and more unteuuble jurisdiction over the vessels of the United States" even to declaring such vessels, their tackle, Ac. to be forfeited if found tishing within three miles of the British coast. .The President says: "It ia not known that any condemnations have been made under tbis statute. Should the au thorities of Canada attempt to enforce it, Hi become my duty to take such steps it as may be necessary to protect the rights ol the citizens of the United States." The claim is now set up by her Majesty officers tbat our fishing vessels have no riht to enter the British porta in North America for the purpose of trading, except to purcliase wuud aud water, and that they must depart within twenty-lour hours, af ter receiving notice to leave. It is not known that any of our vessels have- been seized under this claim,. but the President declares it caunot be acquiesced in by our Government, and that it Is contrary to the Convention of 18.18. Anticipating that these unfriendly acts of the Canadian au thorities may be repeated the coming tea sou, be recommends Congress to autho rise him to suspend by proclamation, operations of the laws authorizing transit of goods, wares and merchandize bond, or access to the territory of United States from Canada ; and further, should such an extreme measure become necessary, to suspend the operations any lata whereby the vessels of l be Do minion of Cinada are permitted to enter the waters of the United States." 

FREE KAVIOATIOS fiT TKB 8T. 'lAWBESCE. The President states that a similar un friendly disposition has been manifested by Canada, in claiming a right to exclude our citizens from the navigation of the Lawrence river. He says : "This river constitutes a natural outlet to the ocean for States of the Union with an aggregate population of about 17,600, 000 inhabitants, and with an aggregate rtonnage of 661,367 tons upon the waters which discharge into it. The foreign com merce of Our ports on these waters is open to British competition, and the major part of it is done in British bottoms. If American seamen be excluded from natural avenue to the ocean, the monopoly of the direct commerce of I lie lake ports with the Atlantic svouJd be in foreign hands, their vessels dn trans-Atlantic voy ages, tiavinir an- access to our lake ports wlj(.h w,,,,; 4, tfenifcd loaUoerican ves- ee8 on similar voyages. To state ouch proposition is to refute its justic." Tbe Preideut cites the example of other 'nations which have declared the naviga- tion of great riven fcee to tb peopl the countries bordering upon themj and states that Mr. Clay, during the adminis tration xif Jobs Quiney Adams, unques tionably demonstrated tha natural right of our citizens to the free navigation of the St. Lawrence to and into the sea, even though passing through the territory of another power.Tbe President says ; . ( "This right does not exclude the co-equal right of the sovereign possessing the terri tory througti whica tlie river debouches into Uie sea, to make such regulations re lative to the policy of navigation as may be reasonably 'necessary j but those regu lations should be framed in a spirit ol coutityk and should nut impose needless, burdens upon the commerce which has the right of transit. It has been found in practice more advantageous to arrange these regulations by tuutual agreements. The L ulled States are ready to make any arrangement as to the police of the St. Lawrence, which tuay U suggested by Great Britain. . ' v ' : ' ' The whole nation is interested In se curing cheap transportation from the agri cultural States ot the West to the Atlantic seaboard. To the citizens of those States it secures a greater return for their labor ; to the iubabilauts of the seaboard it offers cheaper food ; and to the nation an in crease in the annual surplus of wealth. It is hoped thai the Government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and Inconsistent claims to which uer Canadiau froviuces have urged her adherence." OUR 

DEPRESSED COMMERCE. The President refers to the fact that the greater share of our foreign commerce is now carried ou in foreigu vessels. He says t "The cost of building iron vessels, the only ones that can compete with foreign ships in the carrying trade, is so much greater in tho United States than in for eign countries, that without some assist ance from the Government they cannot successfully be built here. There will lie several propositions laid before Congress in the course of the present session, loot ing to a remedy for this evil. . Even if it should be at some cost to the National Trensurv. I hope such encouragement will be given as will secure American shipping on . the high seas, aud American ship building at home." 1HI 

FINANCES OF TAB GOVERNMENT, We copy In full (ho paragraphs of the Message referring to tbis important 8ub ject, and commend them to the special at tion of our readers : The estimates for the expenses of the Government for the next fiscal year are $18,244,346.01 less than forthecurrent one, but exceed the appropriations for the pres ent year fot the same items, $8,972,127.55. in the estimate, however, is iucluded $22, 338,278.37 for public works heretofore be gun under Congressional provision, and of which only so much Is asked as Congress may choose to give. The appropriation for the same works for the present fiscal year was $11,984,818.08. , The average Value of gold, as compared with national currency, for the whole of the year lbti9, waa about 134, and for eleven months of 1870 the same relative value has been about 115. The approach to a specie basis is very gratifying, but the fact can not be denied that the instability of the values of our currency is prejudicial to our prosperity, and tends to keep up prices, to the detriment - of trade. The evils of a depreciated aud fluctuating cur rency are so grest that now, when the premium on gold bus fallen so much. It would seem that the time has arrived when, by wise and prudent legislation. Congress 'should look to a policy which would place our currency nt par with gold at no distant day. The tax collected Irom the people has been reduced more than eighty million dollars per anuum. By steadiness in our preseut course, there is no reason why in a few short years the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the dour of the citizen almost entire ly. With tho revenue stamps dispensed by the poslmasiars in every community; a tx upou liquors of all sorts, and tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tarill', which will put a duty ouly upon those articles which one could dis pense with, known as luxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be pro duced after a lew years of peace and the consequent reduciiou of indebtedness, to fulfill all our obligations. A lurcher re duction of the interest account may te ro lled on to make this practicable. 

REVENUE REFORM. If it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the reve nue for the support of Government, for the PHvment of principal and interest of the public debt, pensions, etc, by directly taxing the people, then 1 am against ''reve nue reform," aud confidently believe tho ueoule are with me. If it means failure to provide the uecessarv means to defray all expenses of the Government and thereby repudiation ol the public debt and pen sions, then I am still more opposed to such kind of "leveuue reform." "Reve nue reform" lias not been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to Biipply every man's wants without any cost or effort on his part. . A true rev enue reform cannot be made in a day, but must ia) the work of national legislation and of time. As soon as the revenue can be dispensed wilh, all duty should be re moved from coll ee, tea, aud other articles of universal use, not produced by our belves. The necessities of the country compel us to collect revenue from our im ports. An armv of Assessors and Collect- ! o:s is not a pleasant sight to the citizens, but that or a tariff Tor revenue is necessa ry. Such a tariff, so far as it acta in en couragement to home products, atTords employment to labor at living wages, in oontrnat to the pauper labor of the Old World, and, also, aids iu the developemeut of home re&ources. . ARMY AND NAVY. the the in the of St. the The army has been gradually reduced j ud the act of July, 1870, and it will not exceed, at the beiriuning ol next year, tne number authorized by law. A very sat isfactory reduction Is shown in the ex penses of the army for the last year, for details of which Congress' is referred the report of the Secretary of War. The President recommends an appro priation for a new building f.r the War Department. The expenses of the Navy were reduced last year about one million below those the previous yeur, or to less than nineteen millions. The estimates for the current year are $28,205,G78.37. The appropriations made for the last and current years, were evidently intend ed by Congress to be, and are sufficient oujy to ker p the navy ou its present .foot ing, and for thereparing and refitting our old Rhlps. This policy mnst. of conrse, gradually but surely destroy the navy, and is, itself, far from economical, as each year that it ia pursued the necessity for more repairs in ships and navy yards be comes more imperative and more costly, and our current expenses are increased the mere repair of ships, many of which must soon be unseawortby aud useless. I hope during the present sesaidn Congress to be able to submit to it a plan by which naval vessels ran tie built and repairs made with a great Saving upon the present cost. It can hardly be wise statesmanship in a Government which represents a country with over five thou sand miles of coast line, on both oeeans, exclusive of Alaska, aud containing 40, 000,000 of progressive people, with rela tions of every nature with almost every foreign country, to rest with such inade quate means of enforcing any foreign pol icy, either of protection or redress. Separated by the ocean from the nations the eastern continent, onr Navy is our on ly means of direct protection to our citizens abroad, or for th enforcement of any for eign policy. 

POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT. a of The accompanying report of the Post master General shows a most satisfactory working Of the Department. With fbe adoption of the recommendations con tained therein, particularly those relating to a reform in the franking privilege and adoption of correspondence cards, a self- sustaining postal spstem may speedily looked lor, and at no distant day, a furth er reduction of the rats of postals will . attained. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM Alwsvs favoring practical reforms, I respectfully call your attention to one abuse of long standing which I would like to see remedied by this Congress. It is a reform in the civil service ol the country. I would have it go beyond the mere tenure of office of clerks or employes who do not require the advice and consent of the Sen ate to make their appointments complete. I would have it govern, not the tenure, but the manner of making all appoint ments. ' - - There Is no duty which so much embar- asses the Executive and heads of Depart ments as that of appointments, nor is there any such arduous and thankless labor im posed on Senators and Kepresentatlves as that of finding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men and often not even nt men for public places. The elevation and purifi cation of the civil service of the Govern ment will be bailed with approval by the w hole people of the United Slates. -" 

INDIAN AFFAIRS. Reform In the management of Indian af fairs has received the special attention of the Administration from its inauguration to the present day. The experiment of making it a'missionary work, was tried with a few agencies given to the denomin ation of Friends, and has been found to work most advantageously. All agencies and superintendencles not so disposed of were given to officers of the army. The act of Congress reducing the army renders army officers ineligible for civil positions, Iudian agents being civil offi ces, I determined to give all the agencies to such religious denominations as had heretofore established missions among the Indians, and perhaps to some other de nominations which would undertake '.the work ou the suuie terms,ta3 a missionary work. The societies selected are allowed to name their own agents, subject to the ap proval of the Executive, and are expected to watch over them and aid ibem aa mis sionaries and christians, and civilize the Indian, and to train bim in the arts of oeace. The Government watches over the official acts of these agents, and re quires of them as strict an accountability asiftttev were appointed in any other manner.- I entertain the confident hope that the policy now pursued will iu a few years bring ail the Indians upon a reser vation where they will live in houses, and have school houses and churches, and where they will be pursuing peaceful and self-sustaining avocations, aud where they may be visited by the law-ahidin white man with the same impunity that he now visits the civilized white settlements. I call your special attention to the report of the Commisioner of Indian Affairs for full Information oh this subject. THE 

PUBLIC LANDS. ' of of During tho last fiscal yenr 8,095,413 acres of public lane's w-ts disposed of. Of this quantity, 3,693.05 acres were taken under the homestead law, and 2,159.515 81 acres sold for cash. The remainder was located with military warrant, agricultural college or Indi an scrip, or applied in satisfaction of grants to various railroads, or for other public uses. The entries under tho homestead law, dqring the past yea?, covered 961,541.55 acres, mr than those during the preceding year. Surveys have been vigorously proseeuted to the extent of the means applicable to the purpose. The quan tit' of land in market will amply supply the present demand. Tho President refers to tho existing laws which secure . homcpteads to actual settlers on' public lands on much more liberal terms than former ly, and which place a home within the reach of all. Ho approves this pol'cy, and also the setting apart to new States of certain lands for educa tional purpose,'. Ho adds : When ample provisions shall have been made for this object, I submit as a question worthy ot serious consider ation, whether the residue of our na tional domain should not be wholly disposed of under the provisions of the homestead ana pre-emption laws In addition to the nvnran and overflowed lands granted to the States in which they arc situated, the lands tuaen under tho Agricultural College acts, and tor internal improvements, or improvement purposes, under the act ot September, 1811, and the nets supplemental thereto, there had been convoyed up to tho close of the last fiscal year, by 'patent or other equiva letit evidence of title, to Slates and coipiratior s, 2.733 25 and 13 100 acres for railways, canstls and wagon rouds It is tstimatcd that an addi tional qnanthy, ot 1 i 4,i M,iS.i acres is btiil duo under grants lor like uses. The policy ot mus aiuing tne Stales in building works of internal improvements was inaugurated more than forty years since by grants to Indiana and Illinois, to aid them in opening canals to connect the wa ters of the Wabash with those of Lake Eric, and the waters of the Illinois with those of Lake Michigan. It was followed with somo modifica tion in the grant to Illinois of alter nate sections of public land within certain limits to tho Illinois Central Railway. Fourteen States and sundry corpo rations have received similar subsi dies, in connection with railways com pleted or in process of construction. As the reserved sections are rated at the double minimum, the sale of them at the enhanced price has thus in many instances indemnified the treas ury for the granted lands. The con struction of some of these thorough fares has undoubtedly given' vigorous impetus to tho developemeot of our resources and the . settlement ol the more distant portions of the country. It raaj-, however, be well insisted that much of our legislation in this regard has been cbaructerizod by in discriminate and pi;ofi!icliberality. The United Slates should not loan their credit in aid of any enterprise undertaken by Suites or corporations, unless the projected' works ate cf acknowledged national importance. I am strongly inclined to tho opinion that it is expedient and necessary to stop subsidies of either description, but should Congress determine otherwise, I earnestly recommend that the rights of settlers, and of the public, be more effectually secured by appropriate legislation. , THE 

PATENT OFFICE. of Durinr the year ending Septem ber 20, 1870, there were filed in the Patent Office 19,411 applications lor the extension of patents ; 6,bZi pat ents, Including reissues and designs, wore issued ; 110 extended ; and 1,080 allowed but not issued by reason ot the non-payment of final fees. The receipts of the office during the fiscal year were $130,31)4.29 in excess of its expenditures. THE CENSUS. of be be The work of the Census Bureau has been energetically propecnteJ; the preliminary report, containing much information of special value and in terest, will be rady lor delivery during lhe present eession. The re maining volumes will be completed ni h all dispatch consisteet with perfect ocouracy in . arranging nd classifying tho returns. We ehall thus ut no distant day bo furnished with an authentic record of our condition and resources. It will, I doubt not, attest the growing prosperity of the tountry, although during the decaao which has just closed, it was so se verely tried by tbe great wit Waged to maintain its integrity and to secure and perpetuate our fred institu tional , ;.---'. 

PENSIONS. During the last fiscal year the sum paid to pensioners, including the cost of disbursement, was $27,780,81 I II," and 1,758 bounty land warrants were issued. ' At its' close 198,680 names were on the pension rolls. The labors of the Pension Offlco have been directed to a severe sciu inyofthe ev! dence submitted in favor of controvert ed claims, and to " tho- 'discovery- of fictitious claims which have boon heretofore allowed. The appropria tion for the employment of special agents for the investigation of frauds has been judiciously used'and tho results obtained have been of unques tionable benefit to the Borvice. EDUCATION AND AGRICULTURE. The eubjeets of education aud agri culture " are of' great interest to the success of our Republican institutions, happiness and grandeur as a nation. In tho interests of one a buroau has been established in the Interior De partment, the Bureau of Education ; and in the interests ot tho other a separate Dopartment, that of Agri culture. I believe great general good is to follow from the operations of both these bureaus, if properly fostered. I can not commend to your careful consideration too highly the reports of the Commissioners of Education and ot Agriculture, nor urge too strongly liberal legislation to secure their efficiency. MISCELLANEOUS. Treaties for the extradition of crim inals have beea coucluded with sever al of the Central American republics, and others are in pr6gress. The early action of Congress U re. quested in regard to the commission heretofore appointed oa claims against Venezuela, The President states that after the recent massacre of French and ltussian residents in China, he requested France and Germany to suspend hostilities in that quarter, and to direct their naval officers to act with ours in the future protection of Americans and Eu ropeans in China. The naturalization, treaty, and the treaty abolishing mixed courts for the suppression of the slave trade, have been ratified with Great Britain An error was discovered last April in the boundary line between the U States and British Possessions,' near Pembiana, by which the fort of the Hudson's Bay Company is found to be within the real limits of the U. States. The President consented that the British occupation of the Fort should continue for the present ; and he rec ommends the appointment of a joint commission to fix the true boundary line from the Lake of the Woods to the summit of the Rocky Mountains. A new building is needed for the preservation of the Government ar chives in tho State department, and Congress is asked for a suitable appro priation. The President recommends that all powers and duties in relation to the Territories, with which the State De partment is now charged, be trans ferred to the Interior Department and that the payment of soldiers' pen sions bo transferred from the Interior to the. War Department, and that naval pensions to the Navy Depart ment. He also recommends that the Postmaster Oeneral and Attorney General be authorized to issue all com missions to officers appointed in their respective departments Tne' Message very appropriately concludes with the following clear and Intelligent statement of the
