Upon the arrival of the editors by the afternoon train, they were met at the depot by a committee, with carriages, and from there were driven through the city, visiting a'l pole ts of interest; and after the| drive through the city, weredrivenj up to view the magnificent steel ' railroad bridge in course of con struction at this place. At 6 p. m. the editors had a business meeting in the parlors of the Park Central, which continued in session until 8 p. m. After adjournment, the edi tors were banqueted by the Board of Trade at the Park Central dining rooms. About one hundred of the prominent citizens of Gallipolis, ?together with the editors?made up the party. It was a grand af fair, and we have been at many an editorial banquet, but we never saw a table bo loaded with good things as wo helped devour at the Park Central. Tho Board of Trade itnd business mon of Gallipolisdid themselves proud upon this occa sion; and all the editors went away determined to say something nice about Gallipolis and its citizens. The talk about the election of Cleveland having had much to do wi>h the existing hard limes is tho shoerest ? nonsonse. Tho Republi can press and stump orators did what they could during the cam puiizn tu alarm tho maufacturing and mining interests of tho coun try over the free trade bugaboo,1 und in measure succeeded, bur everybody who has tuken the luub-o to do his own thinking since the election has cleraly seen that there was nothing in the Re publican cry on this subject. Wo have nover had free trade in this country. We vory much doubt whether we will huve it within the life time of any person now living. So fur as the incoming Administration will be concerned there will bo no moro danger of even nn approximation to frco trade than thoro would have been had Mr. Blaino succeeded. The Scnnte is Republican. Tho Demo cratic House cannot make laws by itself. Tho Senato must concur. There will, therefore, be no tarifl legislation that the Senate docs not want, or that the Rcpulican party does not want. But the Democratic party is as much interested in the growth and prosperity of tho country, to say the least, as the Republican party. It will lend its best efforts to pro mote these objects. It will do uothing in tho contrary direction. f course tho croakers and prop hets of evil omen can do much to hioder and dolay the party in the accomplishment of its beneficent deigns, but the business of the country cannot bo permanently in j urod by these dolorous fellows.? Kx, A few days ago Governor Hoadly, of Ohio, received a communication from the Trades Assembly of Cin cinnati demading the removal of t he Pinkorton guards, of Chicago, from the Hocking Valley. Tho lutler alleged that the "importation of armed tnon into the State is con trary to the lawd of Ohio and the United Slates." "It has also been represented to us," says the letter, "that these men commit many oulragos upon citizens of that lo cality undor cover and authority of law." The opinion is expressed that many of the unlawful acts committed in that vicinity havo been instigated or carried out by theio men in ordor to prolong tho necessity for their presence. There are pome astouuding frauds boing unearthed in the Navy De partment, but it won't ho a side show, ravs an exchange, to tho cir cus thero will be when tho Demo crats begin to rip up things. The Wetzel Deinocral, says Gen. John A. Logan was onco a Demo crat, und this accounts for tho fact that he is a much decenter and bel ter man than Blaine. A man who lias never been u Democrat, is to be pitied, A Parkorsburg correspondent of the Wheeling Register says that lion. D. H. Leonard will probably bo the next Democratic candidate for Congress from tho Fourth Dis trict. Tho man who believes that the rebels will pension robel soldiers is an idiot and the man who tells it, talks lUce & fool. The official returns of the Octo her election as compiled at the Stats House, Wheeling, makes Mr. Wilson'* majority for Governor, 4,985. So those who bet ou 5,000 Uvj lost. LETTEB [From our Regular Correspondent. Washi.notos, Doc^fl, 188f The first week of the second iea ?!on of (be Forty-eighth Congreai has ended. Already both of the Legislative bodies have settled down to work. Thia they did al mott m naturally and quietly as if only a weok instead of fire months bad intervened between the last and present meeting. On last Monday when the Pre?! dent of the Senate and the Speaker of the House brought down their gavels exactly at no'on, thus open ing Congress, crowds of visitors filled the galleries; both chambers bad aD air of freshness, and clean liness, and the desks of Senators and Representatives wero loaded with ilotrers. Otherwise there was but liitle to indicate that it was the beginning of a new session. One interesting and decidedly unusual feature of the occasion was the good naturod charting indulged in by the Democrats at tho expense of their Republican friendrf, over the result of the Presidential elec tion. The Republicans took Ihc bantering in good part, and no bit torness was manifested. Congress man Cox, of Now York, was con spicuously busy in offering coni'.a lence to his political opponents. The democrats are in C.nu spirits, but the Republicans vkillfully con ceal any dejection they may feel. The Southern members are not so demonstrate as it was predicted they would bo. They congratula ted ?ach other on the Democratic victory, but they seemed to be im pressed with the-duty of restrain ing hilarity in presence of their defeated opponents. The President's message was lis tened to in both liouses with the usual inattention. The proportion of Senators and Members who lounged and looked bored, and tried tokilltimo whs considerably greater than tho number of attentive lis teners. Congressmen consider the oflicial reading of clerks very mo notonous, and prefer to get their impressions of an Executive docu mi-nt from their own perusal of it. After an extended inquiry among them 1 learn that, an a wholo, thoy think President Arthur's las't an nual me.-sago is his best. They praiso it for its dignity, for its torn por, and for the clearness und sim plicity of its style. But the report of the Secrotaryof the Treasury is more commented upon than the Presidents message. It has been callcd tho most vigor ous presentation of the financial condition of the country that has ever been made. Mr. McCulloch has pleased the friends of lower taxes in hia Tariff recommenda tions, hut his position will doubt less excise a great dissent iu his own party. The first sensation of the session was raised in the Ilonse of Repre sentatives by Congressman Follett's impeachment resolutions. He brought charges against Marshall Wright in connection with the employment of deputy Marshals at the election in Cincinnati. A short, bitter debato followed in which Messers Convorso, Hiscock, Reed, Brum, Miller, and ex-Speak er Koiffer took part, and tho reso lutions wore Dually adopted. Tho new Senator, Mr. Sheffield, who is the temporary successor of the late Senator Anthony of Rhode Island is about sixty years old.? He is quito lame and walks labor iously with the assistance of a large cano. Ho has a few straggling locks of hair, which he combs over a bald head, a benevolent counten ance, and prefers, for an every day garment, a la Senator Conger, and Representative Poland, a swallow tailed coat. Senator Logan occupies hi* old seat in the Senate chamber between the two Maine Senators, and was the first man to break tho brief si lence after the chaplains prayer ou opening day. Democrats as well as Republicans bought the first op portunity to shake hands with the defeated candidate and pass some words of friendly greeting. Gen. Logan met them all with a smile and ready reply, but it was evident that his old time cxuberunce of spirits could nut bo summoned at will. D. In West Virginia you can't go behind tho returns in an election :u*e. In Illinois you can. That is j just thodiflerenco between a Demo cratic and a Republican State. Cleveland and Hendricks will prove uo dead heads in the entor | prise of managing their own busi ness. They are ijbout as lively a pair of rattlers as ever bulged through the pines.?Democrat. Lot Wright the U. S. Marshal, who armed rutlians at the October polls in Cincinnati, lias boon im peached by lion. Jno. F. Fullott, on the floor of the House, and will bo investigated. The Presidential Electors for this 8tate met at Wheeling Wednesday, and cast the vote of West Virginia fur Cleveland and Iloodricki. Representative Hopkins' bill to establish the olBoe of a Government Architect, provide* that the Prwi; dent ?hall Appoint a Government architect to bold office four yean, who iball receive an annual salary of dollars, When the erection of a public building shall be deter mined upon the architect shall ad verliie for competitive plana and specifications, accompanied with id estimate of coat, which shall be submitted together with the archi tect's own recommendations to a board composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, Poatmaster-General, Secretary of the Interior and At tornny General. Tbe plan ap proved by tbe Board shall be carried out in tbe construction of the build ing and no change shall he allowed except with the sanction of the Board, upon tbe recommendation of the Government architect. Tbo architect whose plans are adapted shall receive the usual compensa tion. The bill provides that the office of Supervising Architect of the Treasury and Architect of tbe Capitol shell cease to exist April i, 1885. Tbe Ohio Klver itullroud. Preparations for the extension of the Ohio Rivor R. R. are being pushed with great energy. Mason city hus granted the. right of way through her street.') and will soon vote on a proposition to issue 86, 000 to the company fur right of way purposes. The surveying corps have com pleted their work, and nothing is in the way of letting contracts ox cept the right of way, und several persous ure busily engaged in se curing that. If the right of way is secured the building of the exten sion to Point Pleusant will begin with theopeningofspring. Sever ul of tho capitalists of the company ivere here recently and expressed themselves as very much pleased with tbo upper end of the line, and anxious for the completion of the lower ond. The road is a success and its valuo to tbe people between here and Wheeling during the pust summer cannot be estimated, and it will be worth when completed millions of dollars to the people be tween here and the Kanawha. Any obstruction to the building of the road is an injury to their own interests. They should give it all possible encouragement uud aid.? Sentinel Col. W. N.Chanoellor ttnd Joseph Xeul, E<i|., of Purkersburg, ctune upon the Ohio Rivor road, Satur day. liotb of them say that the extension of the now roud to Point Pleasant is un assured fact. The running uf tho lino has been prog ressing with general rapidilv. Tho mattorof tho right of way 'is causing some little trouble. Not any mor?, however, than is inci dent to such enterprise. "It will cost fifty or sixty thousand dollars," said Col. Chancellor, "and we think that Wheeling should do much to ward helping us out in this mutter. Wheeling lias been the great bene ficiary of tho coming of the road now in operation. TheOhio River road carries a greater number of passengers into that city than any road running into it. The open ing up of that great stretch of wealthy country intervening be tween Piirkersburg and Pt. Pleas ant cannot fuil to inure to hor ben efit. Owing to low stages of wntor on tho upper Ohio tho products of this stretch go down the river. Wheeling has as good a market and offers shippers as good udvan tngo as points abovo and below. It is nearer than Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, and any effort mado to get ttode by Wheeling would he, [ think, successful. Wheeling should contribute at least twenty thousand dollars townrd perfecting this enterprise."? Intelligencer. IIihImod nud U illlnuiHOU.

Tho cuso has attracted more atten tion than any ever tried in this court for years. Tho cuso originat ed hist summer, ufler the sudden departure of Mr. it. 11. Hudson, mention of which was made in these colums at that time. Willi amson had heen endorsing notes for Hudson prior to his departure, and was to receive 85 for every one to which bo attached his signature. His part was ull right, hut as soon as Hudson left Capt. Williamson began to get uneasy, as he hail no idea how much paper ho had en dorsed, as he nevor kept a memor andum of tho notes. Afier Hudson had got safely away Capt. William son set up a cry that ull the notes in excess of 80,500 that had his signature as endorser upon them wore forgeries. The Ohio Valley Hank, of Gullipnlis, which held threo notes calling for 8500 each, and which were claimed by Willi amson as forgeries, brought suit to test tho genuineness of them. Cashiers of nearly all tho banks in this vicinity nmf a number of busi ess men of this city, who wore acquainted with thu signature of Capt. Williamson, wpre put upon the witness stand, and their testi mony nearly all went to show that the notoB were genuine. Tho nppearance of Mr. Hudson in court caused the dofense to look a little blue, as they supposed he was in Canada, or "some other sea port." There aro about fifty more [cases similar to tho above, against Mr. Williamson. Tho ovideiico in the case was all in Wednesday night, and Thursday morning the case was argued by the attorneys, Messrs. Orosvenor & Vorhes and Itussel! ? Russell appeared fur tho plaintiff, and Guthrie <fc Giles and J.Q Speaker for the defendants. The case has excited moro than usual interest on aooount of the high standing of tho parties in this community. The total amount in Tbe abort caw was given to the ay Wedneiday evening, and after ng out but about three boars the "noble twelve" brought in a verdict in favor of tbe plaintiff Ca(>t. Williamson et al. will be compelled to par the Ohio Valley Bank the principal and interest on iHjPiSS n?tM' "mounting to ?1,652.95, and costs in the case. The attorneys for the defendants will (ile their mutioc for a new trial. The decision of the case brought by the Ohio Valley Bank has settl ed the matter of forgery, ind the probabilities are that Capt. Willi amson will be compelled to pay tbe interest and principal on all the notes which he haj indorsed for Hudson.?ilotquito. A DUtremitiig Accident. Last Thursday evening Mis* Annie Hubbard, second daughter of Mr. John F. Hubbard, Sheriff of Kanawha county, jumped from a buggy while tbe horse attached to. it was running away, and was hurled to ground with great force, her head striking against a piece of lumber projecting from a pile where sho fell, from which she sus tained such sorious injury that she ha* been lying in an itnconiteliiS condition ever since. Immediately after the accident, which occurred on Washington street, she was car ried to her home where she has re ceived the best medical attendance, The preceding incidents, were: Mr. Julius Staling, clerk at Noyes', was driving and a portion of the back harness became unloosed. Mr. Staling reached over the dash board to fasten it and the dash board broke, throwing him on the horses legs. Tho horses became! frightened and jum|>ed and ran. Mr. Staling wan thrown to the ground and the horse went on with Miss Hubbard, with the result a* above stated. Information received this morning, shows that ber con dition is very dangeiuim.

A woman named Carrie Scott, living in upppr Hinton, while carelessly handling a pistol on Tuesday morning, accidentally discharged it, and fell a victim to her own imprudence, as the ball took effect in her head, causing almost instant death. There was no one presnnt but a negro woman and Her child. The woman says that Carrie Scott took tbe pistol fiom the shelf, and was looking in the muzzle when itlired and she fell. Tho ball entered near the noao, and penetrated the brain. An inquest was held, and a ver dict rondered iu accordance'with the above facts. Elias Surbaugh, a stepson of Mr. John L.
