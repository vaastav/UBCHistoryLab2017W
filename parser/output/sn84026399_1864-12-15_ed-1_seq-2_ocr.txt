possession exhaustion ; that we are gath ering strength, aud niay;if need he, iriain taiu'the contest indefinitely. This, as to men. Natural resources are now mpre com plete and ahundant than ever. The na tional resources, then, are unexhauste'd, aud, as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to reestablish and main tain the uatinnal authority is unchanged, aud, as we believe, unchangeable. The manuer of continuing-tho effort remains to choose. On careful consideration of ull the evidence accessible, it seems to me that no attempt at negotiation with the insurgent leader could result in any good. He would accent of nothing short of the severance of the Union. His declara tions to effect are explicit and oft-repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us. He affords us no excuse to deceive ourselves. We cannot Toluntarily yield it. Between him and us the issue is distinct, simple and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war, and decided by vic- lf we yield, we are beaten;' if the Southern people fail bim, he is beaten either way it would be the victory and defeat following war. What is true, how ever, of and him who holds the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he caunot rcaccept the Union, they cau. Some of them, w.e know, already desire peace and reuuion. The number of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace .imply by laying down their arms and submitting to the National authority an der the Constitution. After so much the Governmuut could not, if it would, main tain war against them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If ques tions should remain we would adjust them by the peaceful means oflegislation, con ference, counts and votes. Operating only in constitutional and lawful channels, some certain and other possible questions are and would be bey ond the Executive power to adjust for instance, the admission of members into Congress, and whatever might require the appropriation of money. The Excutive power itself would be really diminished by the ocssation of ac tual war. Pardons and remissions of for fciture, however, would still be within Executive control, In what spirt and temper tins control would be exercised can be fairly judged of by the past. A year ago geueral pardon and amucsty up on specified terms were offered to all ex cept certain designated classes, and it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within con templation of special clemency. During the year many availed them selves of the ceneral provision and many more would, only that the sijns of bad iaith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical pro ;ccse less easy aud certain. During the same time, also, special pardons been granted to individuals ol excepted classes. and no voluntary application has beeu denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all, except such as were not in condition to make free choice ; that is, such as were in custody or under constraint. It is still so open to all, but the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed, and that in Jieu more virorou.-- measures than heretofore shall be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the National authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indis pensable condition to ending the war on the part of the Government, I retract no thing heretofore said as to Slavery. I re peat the declaration made a year ago, and that while I remain in my present posi tion 1 shall notattempt to retractor modify iho Emancipation Proclamtion. Nor shall I return to Slavery any person who is free by the return of that Proclamation or by the Acts of Congress- If the people' should, by whatever mode or means, make it an executive duty to re-enslave such persons, another, and not I, must be their instrument to perforin it. In stating a single condition of peace. I mean simply to say, that the war will cease on the part of the Government whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it.

The December term of our 'Courts commence on Monday a week. This will afford those of our subscribers, and our Job aud Advertising patrons. whoae in arrears an opportunity to call, or send, and pay up. Snow. W Snow fell at this place on Friday night last to the depth of nearly a foot. As the "round was iu good order to receive it. and a slight sprinkling of rain on Satur day packed it sufficiently to prevent drif ting, those ot our citizens who have, the means or conveniences, have now anwop ortunity. of enjoying as good sleighiug as we have had for many years. Of course we do uot rauk with the fortunate ones. The snowstorm extended over sl large scope of country. The Enrollment,Board, Has now been hi session in our borough for uearly two weeks, and will probably leave for Easton on Saturday. Since the Board has been in session here numbers of our own citizens, and citizens of the other couutics of the District, have trans acted business with it, aud we have yet to hear the first word of complaint. All with one accord speak in the highest terms of the gentlemanly manner in which they have beeu treated, and the prompt ness with which everything in the way of business has been done. Men who had been prejudiced by the evil reports which had reached them were the loudest in praise of the Board, and its clever Clerks Donations. In view of tlrt high price of every thing eatable and wearable, and of the fact that ministers salaries have not been increased, it becomes the especial duty of the public to make their donations as liberal as their means will allow. We hope this duty has not been overlooked thus far, this season, and that it will not be iu the douations yet to come off The card for Mr. Seifcrt's donation will be found in this paper. The President's Message. This State paper will be found in our paper, this week, entire. It is a plain straight forward document, and should be read by every man who feels an interest in the country and its welfare. No one reading it can arise from the pleasant task with misgivings as to what the Pres ident intends to do or not to do. His language has none of the subtlety of di plomacy about it, but on the coutrary is clear, and within the comprehension of every man. n e retrain irom noticing all its good points, because we want eve ry body to read it for himself, and thus be satisfied as to what the President actu ally says and means. ESSIn criticising our notice ot the large Buck shot by Mr. Moses Coolbaugh of Middle Smithfield. which appeared in the Jeffcrsonian, a couple of week? ago, a correspondent of the Monroe Democrat says, that Mr. Coolbaugh voted early in the morning, and left the election grounds immediately after he voted, and that he did not make his appearance there again that day. If this is so how comes it that Mr. Coolbaugh 's name is the two hundred and ninth on the list of persons who vo ted, as kept by the clerks of the election. The names on these lists are usually put in regular order as their owners vote, and we do not believe that the rule was de parted from iu this instance, We can come to no other conclusion than that either the Clerks of the election board, or the Democrats correspondent fib it most abominably, and we don't much be lieve it was the Clerks. Special Notice. Persons desiring to send letters to Pris oners or other persons within the Rebel lines, must observe the following : Rules and Regulations governing "Flag of Truce Letters," established by Major- Gen. J. J?. iJutier : First. No letter must exceed one page of a letter sheet, and must relate purely to domestic matters. Second. All letters (including prison ers') must be sent with five ceuts, postage enclosed, it to go to llichmond, and ten ceuts if beyond. Third, Every letter must be signed by the writer's name iu full, and l. O. ad dress. Fourth. All letters must be inclosed to the Commanding General of the De partment of Virginia and North Carolina, Fortress Monroe, indorsed "Via Fla" of Truce." Fijth. No money will be forwarded except to "Prisoners of War." Sixth. All letters sent to Fortress Monroe without a strict compliance with these rules will be transmitted tothe Dead Letter Office.., Deserter Shot. Mr., Thomas Christman, of Jloss town ship, in this county,.was shot and almost in stantly killed, on Monday;night last Itap pears that Thomasas a. deserter from the army, and tha on the evening in question several of the cavalrymen stationed at tin's place, surrounded the house in which he was residing, preparatory to arresting Jiim. After placing One' of their number as a" guard at the door, th rest of the men entered the house and made inquiry for Christman, who was secreted behind the door. While the questions concerning him were being asked and answered, Thomas, with axe in hand sprang out, struck at the' guard, but fortu nately missed him, and made for the moun tain. The cavalryman immediately started in pursuit, and repeatedly called on him to stop, which he refused to do, Soveral shots were then fired at him, ono of which took effect in his head, and caused "his death al most instantly. While the cavalrymen were in search of a deserter in Lehman township, Pike Co., on Thursday night last, Mr. Jacob Cprtright. a drafted man who had not reported, as was his duty, fearing that he was the man wan ted, made a desperate effort to place a a swamp, in the neighborhood, between him self and the soldiers. He, too,, was repeat edly ordered to stop, but paid no heed to the orders, when he was fired on, and received a severe flesh wound in one of his shoulders. We are pleased to learn that his wound is rapidly healing. We have heard rumon of another affray between the cavalrymen and a deserter in Pike county, in which it is alleged that one of the soldiers received a flesh wound in the leg, and that the deserter was shot in the hip, but we have as yet received no well au thenticated account of the transaction. These cases should be sufficient to con vince all pf the extreme folly of attempting to resist the military officers in the prompt execution of their duty. It is right that de serters should be arrested and returned to the service, which they legitimately owe their country. The preservation of the Government acquires this, and those at the head of affairs are determined that it must be done. The laws of the land make resis tance to or interference with the military au thorities punishable with death. The de sorters well know tin's, and if, knowing it, they are still bent upon resistence, their blood must be upon their own heads. Meeting of the Electoral College The Eeectoral College of Pennsylva nia met m the Senate Chamber at Harris burg at 12 o'clock, on Wednesday the 7th lust. On motion, the Hon. Morton M 'Mich ael was choson president of the College Mr. M'Michael on bcinsr conducted to the chair addressed the College in au able and eloqueut manner. Geo. W. Hamcrsly, Esq., was elected Clerk.

A committee, consisting of three, was appointed to wait upon the Governor and inform him that the Electoral College was in session aud ready to receive his communication. After a short interval the Secretary of the Commonwealth was introduced and presented a massage from the Governor declaring the following gentlemen as duly elected Eleotors, viz : Senatorial.

Blauchard. All the Electors except John Wister having answered to their names, the Col lege weut into an election to supply the vacancy, and the Hon. John P. Clark, of Perry County, was chosen to supply the same. The College then proceeded to ballot for a President of the United States. Tellers were duly appointed. The ballots of all the Electors having beau taken, they were severally opened aud read by the President, and recorded by the Tellers j and the ballots and tally papers corresponding, it appeared and was declared by the President that. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, of Illinois, had received twenty-six votes for Presi dent of the United States. The College then proceeded to a simi lar ballot, and the President declared that ANDREW JOHNSON, of Tennessee, had twenty-six votes for Vice President of the Union States. JOHN A.

After signing the necessary certifi cates the College adjourned sine die. Exemption from the draft. The last draft uroved a failure in not producing the full number of men drawn and called lor, there being u deficiency ol say one-fourth in the aggregate. To com pensate for this dehciency, recourse is to be had to a liberal system of recruitment particularly-of veterans exempt from the draft, and another conscription. The failure of the first draft was attributed to the 3300 clause, aud consequently that the lack of full ranks is to be attributed to the wholesale desertion of bounty-jump ers and others who "O assubstitutcs. Consequently in the coming draft, the provision ot substitution will be with drawn, and personal service of the con script required' as the only method of filling up the ranks. We have no one to blame for this rig orus course of rccruitmcnt'but ourselves, for men in many localities, instead of equalizing the chances of the draft, by aiding in the enrollment aud thereby augmenting the number to be drawn, have done every thing in their power to encumber the enrolling officer, and to aid in the desertion of those declared for service. There is another important duty which falls upon every citizen, and that is the correction of the rolls by the erasure ot the names of such a3 are exempt by rea son of a;j;e, disease or other cause. As every name stricken, off reduces the pro portion of the district quota, our mutual burden is lessened, and assuredly it is more convenient to tender the ground ex emption in advance, than to await the happening of a chance iu drawiug. As far as our district is concerned, we trust that our citizens will see the importance of this forethought and act upon it at once. The provost-marshal invites inspection and correction of his records, as well for his own satisfaction as that of the com munity. Northern Eagle. From bad to Worse. When a man once taiust himself with immorality, there is no limit to his deg radation, and particularly is this remark true with respect to the numerous scions of the F. F V's., who have undergone a preliminary training in the peculiar school of larceny, which constitutes a dis tinctive branch of Confederate warfare, and which ennobles poultry theft, while canonizing bank robbery and arson. Some weeks back a Mexican mail coach was robbed by a party of armed banditte. Among the felons cajitured, was discove red a Captain Vance of the rebel Colonel Forde's staff, and son to the ijovernor of North Carolina, who was at the time, as discovered by documents on his person, absent from his command "on special ser vice." This service appears of a similar character with that devolving upon the Canadian refugees, who, we presume, have equal license to rob a mail bug of Her Majesty, as Vance assumes on the Texan border, provided the patriotic de predators escape irregular detection.
