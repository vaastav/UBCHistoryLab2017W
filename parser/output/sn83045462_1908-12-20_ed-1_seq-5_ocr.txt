Indeed, except for these few weeks be- b fore the yuletide season, that dear old r gentleman, whose memory is a benedlc- P tion, whose smile is a caress, who lives ^ away up yonder near the north pole In a y snug little corner of the toy shop of the world, is very much neglected. But don't you believe he minds. He doesn't; not even a little bit. First off, n he's very, very busy, even in the summer i time. And really, if he weren't a'terribly ' Industrious old gentleman he never in tte " world would have everything ready to p start out promptly at sundown on Christ. y mas eve, as he has for hundreds and hundreds of years, behind his prancing reindeer team, in his great big sleigh, ? with his fat and bulging packs just r crammed with toys and candies and n goodies and such. * Promises to Be Good. c And so for daj'3 all the little folks have P been writing letters to Santa Claus, telling him how good they've been, how good n they're going to be, and mentioning some b tilings they would so much like to have. I Of course, all these letters didn't go to Santa Claus direct. Years and years ago little boys and girls didn't have nearly eo much trouble with their letters. They just wrote them off?and If they were very little mamma or papa helped?and put them up the chimney. And of course that very night Santa Claus, or one of the clever little elfs that work for him, came around. It must I have been that way, for next day the aIt I letters were always gone. th But, nowadays, chimneys, except in the most delightful of old-fashioned houses, c" are really dreadfully small, and any one wa of his little elfs, let alone big fat old ha' Santa Claus, would have a most mussy h.? time getting down. Then, too, these four and five room flats sometimes don't have any chimneys at all. frc And it isn't very pleasant to <alk about, j but there are tots and lots of good little w boys and girls that live in horrid dark rooms that sometimes haven't so much t?1< as a window to let in the fresh air. litl And so, some letters written to the pa- Joj , A V,., iron Baim UI mm ^Iiiiauiiiu nine Ujr Uic U^I] little people he loves are a long time on th? the way, and a few?a very few, let us let hope?never get to him at all. wh Many little ones?those who do not live / /n delightful old-fashioned houses witn th< chimneys?send their letters to Santa wh Claus in care of The Star. And these nei reach their destination, for The Star go: knows where Santa Claus lives and sends to the letters straight to him. One Letter on Brown Paper. Once upon a time, though it wasn't so very long ago, the man who reads the Co Santa Claus letters before he sends them along to Santa himself came across one rj that was different from the rest. The envelope was torn and scratched and most outrageously dirty. And Inside was a piece of brown paper, the kind that butch- ve ers wrap up things in. And written on obr the brown paper?the writer staggered up wl and down and crosswise?was a note, most frc dreadfully misspelled, that said: . "Mr. Santa Claus?My mama works so aa hard and cries and her clothes is tore and ste we don't have much to eat and won t you D bring hpr everything she wants because I to love her and it makes me cry too, and if be you have any left I would like a piece of w. candy." fo, Well, the man who reads the Santa q Claus letters looked at the piece of nQ brown paper for a long time. And then he blew his nose out loud and read the .. brown paper letter again. After awhile he put it in his pocket. Then he thought about his own little M. sunny-haired boy at home, tucked away safe in his little bed, with the tree that jc Santa Claus bad trimmed and the toys that Santa Slaus had brought, waiting right there for him to see when he open- ?j ed his eyes. For this was Christmas Ya eve. . And then the man who reads the Santa na Claus letters blew his nose again. And to then he put on his coat and went out. flo Yop see, it was so late that there CO] wasn't time to tell Santa Claus about the brown paper letter and the little boy ar' whose mamma worked so hard and cried, up But the man knew Santa Claus wouldn't tai care if he attended to things himself. m, And so he did. Most of the stores were closed up. He an found some nice things to eat, however, and some candy and some toys. And he tb put some money in a letter. And then hii he went to the place where the brown w paper letter came from. w( That Nose Needed Blowing Again. tei And the man who reads the Santa pr Claus letters had to blow his nose again, awful loud when he stepped" inside the door. You see, he wasn't a real Santa I Claus, and didn't know how to come eri down the chimney. trl For the room was damp and cold. And ln1 the little boy's mamma was sitting by a ^ little table, on which there was a tiny by piece of candle, tying a bit of ribbon ? around a really, truly peppermint cane. Co From the back of a chair hung the lit- th< tie boy's stocking?empty?and the peppermint cane all sticky from tears. The man who reads the Santa Claus letters felt a big lump come up in his 1 throat, and tlie candle looked to him sort Xrt - APPEAL Hi ioi>a^'y\sluj* 1 Ur, (Stu. h * /v\xLr,u*oxJlyx^i. i?? w Jlu.

Veil, the little boy's mamma read that *r ter, and then she ran to a ragged lit- *>f bed in the corner and lifted the sleepy ?l :le boy in her arms. n? ind the man turned his head and blew i nose again, and he felt mighty good d mighty bad at the same time away wn inside. He kissed the rosy mouth de the drowsy little brown-paper boy and ^ me away. p, *ext day it was Christmas. And one " te, all of a sudden, the man who reads ll< j Santa Claus letters picked up his ill "n little boy and held him close and ised him ever so many times. Then he t him down softly and blew his nose of 3 wiped his eyes. "Goodness, but this ol a fine and dandy Christmas," said the or ui. T1 10 that's what happened as a result of ro it one Santa Claus letter that came to df e Star. Of course, all the letters?very CI v of them, in fact?are not from little H ys whose mothers work hard and cry 1 d are very, very poor. Some of them are 8; ?m tiny folk who have lots and lots of m ngti and whom Santa never has any ai luble to find, but who like to write to tli ) dear old gentleman just the same. of Some Letters to North Pole. to lere are a few of the many that came w The Star yesterday: T1 Dear Santa Claus: I wish you would ring me a little tricycle that I can ?? ide on; a little patrol wagon with cj olicemen in It; a row of soldiers on ^ locks.
