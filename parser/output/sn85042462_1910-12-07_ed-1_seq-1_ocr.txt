CURTISS HERE TO CONDUCT AIR EXPERIMENTS Famous Aviator Brings an Entire Workshop and Twelve - ' ' ' ' ■ r.' ' Aeroplanes on Cars WILL ATTEMPT SEA FLYING Man Bird to Pass the Winter in Southern California. Wife Is 111 ; Glenn H. Curtlss, r the aviator who entertained thousands of Southern Cali fornia people with his daring in the air at the aviation meet held here last January, returned to Los Angeles yes terday and will make his home here during the coming winter. > He Is In Southern California to conduct a num ber of experiments, among others the difficult feat of starting and alighting on the water. Mrs. Curtiss accom panies him. She - became 111 while en route, but her illness is not considered serious. . , Mr. Curtis brought his entire work shop with him from his home in New York. There are several cars filled with machinery, designed especially for airship construction, a carload of aero plane parts and twelve 'machines com plete. With these to work with Mr. Curtiss will conduct his experiments as soon as he is able to get a suitable place to work. " -. Mr, Curtiss has retired from exhibi tion flying and now devotes his time to the construction of I airships and to experimenting with them. He Is ' endeavoring at the present time to work out and perfect some method by which an aeroplane may be used at sea. :\ ■ ' ■ ■ '■ "Southern California has the finest climate and atmospheric conditions known of for flying," said Mr. Cur tiss last evening. "With perfect days throughout the year It Is the ideal spot for experimenting, as no time will be lost in waiting for good weather to try out new ideas. '••',• TO 

MAKE SEA FLIGHTS "At present the experiment ln which I am most interested is the use of the aeroplane at sea. I have experimented to a certain extent with my machines 'on the water and am going to do a whole lot more of It while here. The j difficult feature to solve - is starting the machine and- getting It success fully in the air while aboard a steamer, for i there .Is I little. space , aboard in which to start. *On the ground one has an opportunity 'to I speed . up . and run along the ground until the air lifts the planes of the machine. But on the water no such opportunity la of fered and before aviation at sea be comes a success some other manner of. starting the air craft off must bo found. It la to find such a method that I am here. I shall devote the. greater j part of my time '■ to working ion this ' problem and have hopes of solving it. There are other experiments which . I wish to make hut that is the most Important one." ■-••-■ For the purpose of making experi ments a lease on the Motordrome at Playa del Rey has been secured by Mr. Curtiss and he will do much of his flying there. In all probability he will open a work shop In Los Angeles also i to have the advantage of good machine shops and machinery' near at hand. He is shipping his automobiles to Los An geles and will use them in going back and forth . from the Motordrome. Mrs. Curtiss was taken ill on the i train coming to Los Angeles. She is ! ;at the Alexandria. ' Mr. Curtiss stated ; last evening that he was not prepared \ to talk about the proposed aviation i meet ln Los Angeles this year as he had not taken that matter up since, his arrival. • \&s *■€#;,r\* .''. **

WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 7, 1910. ENGLISH VOTING CONTINUES CLOSE; LIBERALS GAINING Government Has One More Mem ber Than in Last Parlia ment from Same Seats TARIFF PLEA FAILS TO WIN Unionists Lose Laboring District Where Shutting Off U. S. Competition Featured tAssociated Press] / LONDON, Dec. 6.— the close of today's polling the complexion of the house of commons stood: Government coalition: Liberals, 106; Labor, 20; Nationalists, 26; total, 152. Opposition: Unionists, 147. A situation has developed almost phenomenal ln the closeness of the race between the government coalition par ties and the Unionists. The pendulum swung slightly toward the government today, and the result of three days' voting. In which 299 seats have been filled, gives the coalition one more member than In . the last parliament from the same seats. Up to last night the Unionists had a gain of five. The returns tonight showed the Un ionists had regained St. Helens from the laborltes. This borough, • with the exception of last election, had been Unionist since 1906. " The Liberals gained Southwark west: Burnley and Coventry and the labor ltes gained Woolwich and Whitehaven, all from the Unionists, while this morning's returns " from Sunderland showed the liberal candidate, Green wood, and the laborite, Goldstone, had replaced the two Unionists there. The turning of the tide toward lib eralism Is a surprise and a great dis appointment for the ■ Unionists, -who counted on capturing half a dozen seats from the enemy.' The greatest surprise was In Coventry, because of the fact that It Is the seat of motor manufacturing and the protectionists had put great stress on their plea that tariff reform would prevent the grow ing competition from American ma chines. ■ ■ ' ' '■'■ '■_ f _. The Liberals hardly expected to win Burnley, because the Socialist, Hind man, was in the field and hoped to take part of the labor vote. The bat tle in Woolwich was one of the hard est. Will Crooks', a workingman, who was turned out in the last election, re captured his seat by 236. * - _ -'■■ The Unionists. concentrated their heavy- fire on Battcrsea, but John Burns, president of the local govern ment board, ■ again surprised them, bringing up his majority from 655 IrA the last election to 1292. ■ The betting on the stock evchange before election wSs that the coalition majority would . drop to 65. < As the elections progressed the bet ting favored 80, then. 90. .It is now conceded that the government will have 106 majority. ■' .N . 

JOHN BURNS A VICTOR BY GREATLY INCREASED VOTE Dillon and Redmond Re-Elected Without Opposition LONDON, Dec, x 6.—Among the re sults at the parliamentary polling to day was the re-election of John Burns, Liberal, and president of the local gov ernment board. His majority ■in the Battersea district ; over Sir John Har rington, Unionist, was 1292, and over Shaw, Socialist, 7349. His majority over the Unionist candidate last election was 555. ."* '- * '. Among nationalists re-elected with out ' contest were . John Dillon, east division of Mayo, and William H. K. Redmond, east division of Clare. . ' Among the Unionists unopposed was James ,W.

Twelve degrees below zero at Canton, N. V., was the lowest temperature recorded. The . storm centered over the lower Chesapeake Bay this morning, and rain, snow or sleet fell over the entire country from Virginia northeast and through the New England ■ States. A high north east ■ wind roused the ocean, and four ocean steamships which crept - into port today had to anchor in the bay because of the blinding snow. Ship ping was held in port until better weather. • • One of the heaviest snows in many years fell in Kentucky last night and today. The fall In the mountains was two feet, while the lowlands were cov ered with ten inches of snow. Busi ness in the mountain districts is en tirely-suspended.

As the regulations provide, the fife and drum corps, followed by the cadet corps, fell in at the front on the ap pearance of the coffin. The flfers' breath 'froze on their instruments as they shrilled the slow measures of the dead march. Behind them clanked the escorting battery. Then came the coffin, draped in the colors, followed by the pallbearers, mourners and at tending civilians. As the long procession moved through the darkness, the flash of the minute gun flared for an Instant across the shrouded fields, and the dull Jar of the report sounded solemnly across the river. Thirteen guns were fired. Lanterns guided the procession to the grave, and there, while the mourners stood bareheaded In the snow, the coffin was lowered into its resting place, the words of the burial service were spoken; the three crashing vol leys echoed across the river, the bugle sounded "taps," and again the minute guns took up their count.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.—Congress ' gave respectful attention to President! Taft's message today, but there were comparatively few members who were willing to concede the probability of favorable action at the present session' on many of the recommendations con tained . therein. . This was In view of t'-e fact that the sess.on will clo&e 1 March 4. The message was delivered to "both" houses by Secretary.Latta soon after they convened at noon. Mr. Latta made his first appearance in the senate, arriving immedi tly after the an nouncement of the president's intention to communicate his views "in writing." ' This announcement ■ was made by Senator Cullom on behalf of himself and Senator Money, who constitute.! the senatorial committee to Inform the* president that the senate was prepared to receive .recommendations from him. Almost immediately afterward, Mr. Latta delivered the message to the house. The reading of the document, which was of unusual length, was begun at 12:19 p. m. in tho senate. At first most of the senators listened attentively, bv.t gradually this attention ceased on the part of most of them, and those who remained in the chamber devoted them selves to printed copies before them. This also was t,he case in the house. - To the Senate and House of Representatives: I During the past year the foreign relations or the United States have continued upon a ba*t» of friendship and good understanding. Arbitration The year has been notable as witnessing t'i;» pacific settlement of the two important Inter national controversies before the pennant r court of The Hague. The arbitration of fisheries dispute bet n the United States and Great I Britain, j whl '. has been the source of nearly continuous dp ? matte correspondence since the fisheries -".o'- ventlon of 1818, has given an award which it satisfactory to both parties. This arbitral!

' The tribunal constituted at Th* Hague by the governments of the United States and Venezuela baa completed Its deliberations and has rendered an award la th* ' case if the Orinoco Steamship company against Venezuela:; The award may be regarded as satlst. cietf, since It has, pursuant to th* contentl >na of the United States, recognised a number or Im portant principles making for a judicial aft!-' tude in th* determining of International <!!» putes. .
