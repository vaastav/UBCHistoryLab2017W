THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE tfIS ANNUAL REVIEW O THE NATION'S AFFAIRS. 3The President Recommends That Tariff Revision Be Left to the Next fongressA Gener al Review of Affairs and Pro gress of the JMatlon. Washington, Dec. 6.President Harrison's message reads as follows: To the Senate and House of Representa tives: In submitting my annual message to Congress I have great satisfaction in being able to say that the general conditions -affecting the commercial and induseiial In terests of the United States are in the high est degree favorable. A comparison of the existing conditions with those of the most favored period in the history of the country will. I believe, show that so high a degree of prosperity and so general a diffusion of tUe comforts of life were nev-r before en tayed by our people. The total wealth of the country in 1800 was $16,159,616,068. In 1800 it amounted to 862,610,000,000, an Increase of 287 per cent. Xlie total mileage of railways In the United States In 1860 was 30,626 in 1890 it was 167,741. an Increase of 448 per cent: and it fa estimated that there will be about 4,000 mites of track added by the close of the year 1S92. The official returns of the ^teventh^census and those of the tenth een as for seventy-five leading cities furnished the basis for the following comparisons: In 1SS0 the capital invested in manufac turing was $1,232,839,670. In 1800 the capi tal Invested in manufacturing was $2,000,- 335,884. In 1880 the number of employes was 1.301,383. In 1S90 the number of employes was 2,251,134. In 1880 the wages earned were $501,065,- 778. In 1S9 lUid wages earned were $1,221,- 170,454. In 1880 the value of the product was $2.- 711,579,890. In 1890 the value of the product was $4,S60 286.837. I aia informed by the superintendent of -the census that the omission of certain in dustries In 1SS0 which were included in 1890 accounts in part for the remarkable in crease thus shown, but after making full allowances for differences of method and deducting the returns for all Industries In cluded In the cersus of 1880, there remain Sn the reports from these seventy-five cities an increase in the capital employed of $1,- 332.745 604: in the value of the pro'duct of f2.O24.236.106 in wages earned of $677,943.- 909. and in the number of earners employed f 856,029. The wage earnings not only *how an Increased aggregate, but nn in crease per capita from $3S6 in 1880 to 547 ifa 1890, or 41.71 per cent. THE NEW

'Ike Textile VVoild for July, 1S92, states that duiing the hn six montub of the present calendar year 135 new factories wexe bult, of which forty are cot rioa mills, 48 knitting mills, 26 woolen mills, 15 silk mills, 4 plush mills and 2 linen mills. Of the 40 cotton mills 21 fcavc been built lif the Southern states. A. B. Shephenson, of the Isew York TJotton exchange, estimates the number of working aplndle^ In the United States on Sept. 1, 3892, at 15,200,000, an increase of ObO.OOO aver the ^ear 1891. The consumption of cotton by American mills in 1891 was 2,390,- u bales and in 1892 2,534,000 bales, an in -crease of 188,000 bales. From the year I860 1802 inclusive there has been an increase to the consumption of cotton in Europe of "S2 per cent, while during the same period the increased consumption in the United -States has been about 150 per cent. The report of Ira Ayer, special agent of -tte treasury department shows that at the -date of Sept. 30, 1892, there were thirty "two companies manufacturing tin and terne plate in the United States and four teen companies building new works for such marufacture. The estimated investment in traildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June, 30, 1893. if existing con Iltion were to be continued, was $=,00 000," and the estimated rate of production 200.- O00 000 pounds per annum. The actual ?892, roductlon of the quarter ending Sept. 30, was 10.952.725 pounds. The report of Xabor Commissioner I*eek of New York hows that during the year 1891. in about .000 mnmifacturin P- pstahlishments in that state, embraced within the special inrmirv Tiurt bv him and representing '67 different Industries therp was a net in*rpis over the vear 1800 of $31,31 i 68 in the value of th product and of $0,377.925 09 in the Trne of wages paid.

Tae value of the imports of merchandise -entered free of duty in 1892 was 55.3a uer ceat of the total value of imports, as com juured with 43.35 pel- cent in. Ib'Jl and 33.66 .per cent in 1890. In our coastwise trade a most encourag ing development is in progress, there hav Jng beenel*in the. last four yearcommerce an increase 5 A8 cent Internal the statistics show that no such period of pros ifferity has ever before existed. The freight carried in the coastwise trude of the creat lakes in 1890 aggregated 28,205,959 tons. Oa the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio riv ers and tributaries In the same year the ttrafBc aggregated 20,405,046 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit river during that year was 21,684,- rflOO tons. The vessel tonnage entered and cleared lu the foreign trade of London dur Mg 1890 amounted to 13,480,707 tons, and of ^Liverpool 10,9*1,800 tons, a total for these *ro great shipping ports of 24,422.508 tons, -only slightly In excess of the vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit river. And it ,should be Bald that the season of the De troit river was but 228 days, while, of -coarse, in London and Liverpool, the season was for the entire year. The vessel ton yaage passing through the St. Mary's canal -br the fiscal year 1892 amounted to 0.828.- ST4 tons, and the freight tonnage of the De troit river is estimated for that year at -25.000,000 tons, against 23,209.615 tons In 1891. The aggrentate traffic on our railroads -for the yea* 1891 amounted to 704.398,600 tons of frefeht, compared with 001.344.437 tons In 1890. r,n increase of 13,054,172 tons. .Another indication of THK GKNFRAIi PROBPIfRITY of the country Is found in the fact that the number of depositors In savings banks in reased from 693,870 iu 1860 to 4,258,803 in 100, an increase of 513 per cent, and the amount of deposits from $149,277,504 in 1860 to $1,524,844,500 In .1800, an increase of 21 per cent. In 1891 the amount of depos its la savings banks was $1,623,070,749. It Is estimated that 90 per cent of these de- \i,-tsslt8 represent the savings of wage earn The bank clearances for nine months LLgndlnff Sept. 30, 1891, amounted to $41,049,- |j For the same montl|p in 1892 they amounted to $45,180,601,947, an excess for the qine months of $4,140,211,139. There has never been a time in our history when work was so abundant or when wages were as high, whether measured by the currency on which they are paid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat ,have boen low. It is one of the unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer cannot produce upon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the ag giegate production of the year, and is sub ject to the depreciation which follows over pi oductlon. But while tlio faot I have stated is true as to the crops mentioned, the general average of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fair participa tion In the general prosperity* The value of our total farm products has increased from $1.S63,646,S66 in I860 to $4,500,000,000 in 1S01. as estimated by statisticians, an in crease of 280 per cent. The number of hogs Jan. 1, 1801. was 50,025,106, and their value $2,101,193,525 on Jan. 1, 1892, the number was 52,408,019 and the value $241,031,415. On Jan. 1, 1891, the number of cattle was 36,875,048 and the value $544,127,908 on Jan. 1, 1802, the numebr was 37,Q51,235 and the value $570,749,155. If anv are discontented with their state here, If any believe that the wages or prices, thp returns for honest toil are inadequate, they should not fall to remember that there is no other country in the world where the conditions that seem to them hard would .not be accepted as highly prosperous. The English agriculturist would be glad to ex change the returns of his labor for those of the farmer, and the Manchester workmen their wages for those of their fellows at Fall River. I believe that the protective system which now for something like thirty years has pre ailed in our legislation has been a mighty lustrrument for the development of our na tional wealth and a most powerful agency in protecting the homes of our worklngmen from the iuvasion of want. I have felt a most solicitous interest to preserve to our working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread, but supply a com fortable margin for those home attractions and family cemfcrts and enjoyments with out which life is neither hopeful nor sweet. They are American citizensa part of the great people for whom our constitution and government were framed and instituted and it cannot be a perversion of that con stitution to so legislate as to preserve in their homes the comfort, independence, loy alty and sense of interest in the government which are essential to good citizenship in peace and which will bring\ this stalwart throng, as in 1861. to the defense of the flag when it Is assailed. RBGAIDING THE TARIFF It is not my purpose to renew here the ar gument in favor of a protective tariff. The result of the recent election must be ac cepted as having introduced a new policy. We must assume that the present tariff, constructed upon the lines of protection, Is to be repealed, and that there is to be sub stituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference to revenue that no duty is to be higher because the increase will keep open an American mill or keep up the wages of an American workman, but that in every case such a rate of duty is to be imposed as will briug to the treasury of fhe United States the largest returns of revenue. The contest not being between schedules, hut between principles, it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing sarty will not carry into legislation the principles advocat ed by it and the pledges given to the people. The tariff bills passed by the house of repre sentatives at the last session were, as I sup posed, even in the opinion of their promot ers, inadequate and justified only oy the fact that the senate and house of represen tatives were not in accord and that a gen eral revision should not, therefore, be un dertaken. I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the Incoming con gress. It is a matter of regret that this \voik must be delayed for at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes introduces so much uncertainty that an amount not easily estimated of business in action and of diminished production will necessarily result. It is possible also that this uncertainty may result in decreased revenues from customs duties, for ournier clrnts will make cautions orders for for eign goods in view of the prospect of tariff reductions and the uncertainty as to when it will take effect. Those "who have advo cated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous forecasts of a change of policy disappointed. If a system of cus toms duties can be framed that will set the idle wheels and looms of Europe In motion and crowd our warehouses with foreign made goods and at the same time keep ours own mills busy that will give us an in 'creased participation in the "markets of the world" of greater value than the home mar ket we surrender that will give increased work to foreign workmen.upon products to be consumed by our people without dimin ishing the amount of work to be done here that will enable the American manufacturer to pay his workmen 

FROM 50 TO 100 PER CENT nrore in wages than is paid in the foreign mill and yet to compete in our market and in foreign markets with the foreign prcduoer that will further reduce the cost of ai tides of wear and food without re ducing the wages of those who produce them that can be celebrated after its ef fects have been realized, as its expecta tion has been, in European as well as in American cities, the authors and piomoters of it will be entitled to the highest praise. We have had in our history several ex periences of contrasted effects of a revenue and of a protective tariff but this genera tion has not felt them, and the experience of one gereration is not highly instructive to the next. The friends of the protective sys tem, with undiminished confidence in tha principles they have advocated, will await the tesults of the new experiment. The strained and too often disturbed relations existing between the employe and the employers in our great manufacturing establishments have not been favorable to a calm consideration by the wage earners of their effect upon wages. The facts that his wages were the high est paid in like callings in the world and that a maintenance of this rate of wages, in the absence of protective duties upon the pioduct of his labor was impossible, were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests. He may now be able to review the question In the light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby maintained or increased, either absolutely or in their purchasing power and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this country is increased, or even maintained, so that there are more or as many dnys work in a year at as good or better wages for the American work u-gmaa as has been the case under the I,rtectiv system, eyrfy one will rejoice. A gencial process of wage reductions can not be contemplated by any patriotic citi?tn without the trravest apprelienslon. It may be, indeed I believe is, possible for the American manufacturer to compete si cce&sfully with his fore'gn rival in many blanches of production without the de ft nse of protective duties, if the pay rolls are equalized, but the conflict that stands between the producer and that result and the distress of itur working people when it is attained are not pleasant to contemplate. The society of the unemployed, now hold ing its frequent and threatening- parades in the streets of foreign citieH should not be allowed to acquire an American domi c'le. 

WORK OF TITR AriMINTRTTtVriON. The reports of the heads of the several executive departments which are herewith submittd have very naturallythincluded sumo of the whole a re of administra- (,work tion, with the transactions of the last fiscal year. The attention not only of congress but of the country is again invited to the methods of administration which have been pursued and to the results which have been attained. Public revenues amounting to $1,- 414,070,202.28 have been collected and dis bursed without loss from misappropriation, without a single defalcation of such Impor tance as to attract the public attention, and at a diminished per cent of cost for collec tion. The public business has been trans acted not only with fidelity but progressive the fullest possible way the good service es- tween the Great Lakes and one of our own tabllshed and maintained for their protection and comfort. Our relations with other nations are now undisturbedly any serious controversy. The complicated and thi*eatening differences with Germany and England relating to Saflman affairs, with'England In relation to the seal fisheries in the Bering sea, and with Chile growing out of the Baltimore affair have been adjusted. There has been adjusted under section 3 of the tariff law commercial agreements re lating to reciprocal trade with the following countries: Brazil, Dominican republic. Spain for Cuba and Puerto ltico, Gautomala, San Salvador, the German empire, Great Britain for certain West Indian colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras and Austro Hungary. Of these, those with Gautomala. Honduras and Austro-Hungriry have been concluded since my last annual message. Under these trade arrangements a free, fa vored admission has been secured in every case for an important list of American pro ducts. Especial care has been taken to se cure markets for farm products in order to relieve that great Industry lying under de pression for the lack of an adequate foreign market. FOR OUH SURPLUS PRODUCTtOH, also for our manufactured productions, which will, i if this policy is maintained, greatly augment our export trade. The full benefits of these arrangements cannot be realized Instantly. New lines of trade are to be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the field. The manufacturer must adapt his goods to the-new markets and facilities for exchange must be established. This work has been well begun our mer chants and manufacturers have entered the now fields with courage and enterprise. In the ease of food products, and specially with Cuba, the trado did not need to wait and tho immediate results have been gratifying. It the policy of these trade arrangements can be continued in force and aided by the es tablishmoul of American steamship lines, I do not doubt that we shall, within ,a short period, secure fully one-third of the total trade of the countries of Central and South America, which now amounts to about $600,- 000,000 annually. In 1885 we had only 8 per cent of this trade. The following statistics show the increase in every trade with the countries with which we have reciprocal trade agreements from the date when such agreements went into effect up to Sept. 30, 1892, the increase be ing in some almost wholly and in others in an important degree the result of this agree ment: The domestic exports to Germany and Austria-Hungary have increased in value from $47,073,750 to $57,073,064, an Increase of $10,319,308, or 23.63 per cent. With American countries the value of our exports has increased from $44,160,2S5 to $54,013,598. an increase of 10,653,313, or 23.67 per cent. The total increase in the value of exports to all countries with which we have recipro cal agreements has been $20,772,621. This increase is chiefly wheat, flour, meat and dairy products and manufactures of iron and steel and lumber. There has been a large" increase in the value of imports from all these ^countries since the commercial agree ments went into effect, amounting to $74,- 294,293. It has been entirely in imports from the American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, India rubber and crude drugs. The alarmed attention of onr European competitors for the South Ameri can market has been attracted to the new American policy and to our acquisition and their loss of South American trade. BERIKG SEA. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain and the United States as to the killing of seals in the Bering sea was concluded on the 29th of February last. This treaty was accom plished by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration, and a vig orous effort was made during this season to drive out all poaching sealers from the Ber ing sea. Six naval vessels, three revenue cutters and one vessels from the fish com mission, ail under the command of Com mander Evans, of the navy, were sent into the sea, which was systematically patrolled. Some seizures were made, and it is believed that the catch in the Bering sea by poachers amounted to less than 700 seals. It is true, however, that in the North Pacific, while the seal herds were on their way to the parses bejtween the Aleutian islands, a very large number, probably 45,000, were taken. The existing statutes of the United Slates do not restrain our citizens from taking seals in the Pacific ocean, and perhaps should not unless the prohibition can be extended to the citizens of other nations. I recommend that power be#given to the president, by proclamation, to prohibit the taking- of seals in the Noith Pacific by American vessels, so that, regardless of the result, of findings of the tribunal of arbitration or otherwise, the restiaints can be applied to the vessels of all countries. The case of the United States for the tribunal of arbitration has been prepared with great care and industry by Hon. John W. Fester, and the counsel who represent this government express con fidence that a result substantially establish ing our claims and preserving this great in dustry to the benefit of all nations will be attained/'' 

OANADHS QUESTIONS. During the past year a suggestion was re ceived from i he Uritish mimster that the Canadian government would like to comer as to the possibility of enlarging upon terms of mutual advantage to advance the commercial exchanges of Canada and of the United States, and a conference was held, with Mr. Blaine acting for this government and the British minister at this capital and three members of the dominion cabinet acting as commissioners on the part of Great Britain. The conference developed the fact that the Canadian government was only prepared to offer of the United States, in exchange for the concessions asked, the admission of ^at--1 ural products. The statement was frankly made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother country. This admission, which was fore seen, necessarily teimiuated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an ex change of natural products would be almost wholly with the people of Canada. Some other topics of interest were considered in the conference, and resulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alaskan boundary and the waters of Passainaquoddy bay adjacent to Eastport, Me., and in the initiation of an arrangement for the protec tion of fish life In the coterminous and neighboring waters of our northern border. The controversy as to the tolls upon the Welland canal, which was presented con gress at the last session by presidential message, having failed of adjustment, I felt constrained to exercise the authority con ferred by the act of July 16, 1892, and to pioclalm a suspension of the free use of St. Mary's falls to cargoes In tiansport in Can ada. The secretary of the treasury estab lished such tolls as were thought to be equivalent to the exactions unjustly loied upon our commerce in the Canadian canals. If. as we must suppose, the political rela tions of Canada and the disposition of the Canadian government a'-e to remain un changed, a somewhat radical revision of our trade relations should, I think, be made. Our relations must continue to be intimate and they should be friendly. I regret to say, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those as to the fisheries on tlie At lantic, the sealing interests on the Pacific and canal tolls, oar negotiations with Great Britain have continuously been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable and unfriendly objections and protests from Can ada. In the matter of the canal tolls our treaty rights WERE FLAGRANTLY DISREGARDED. It is hardly too much to say that the Ca naumu jrucinc and oiuer lullway lines whiuu parallel our Northei'u oouuuary are sus tained by commerce nawiug eituer its origin or tel-niinus or both, In tne United States. Canadian railroads compete with those of the united states for our trathc and with out the lestramts of our iutei state commerce act. Their cuis pass almost without deten tion into and out of our teiritoiy. 'lhe Cana dian Paclnc railway brought into the United States fiom China and Japan via British Columbia, during the year ended June d0, 1892, 23,239,685 pounds of freight, und it carried fioin the United States to be shipped to China and Japan via British Columbia, 24,068,346 pounds of freight. There were also shipped from the United States over this route for Eastern ports of tne United States from Pacific ports during the same year, 13,912,013 pounds of freight, and there were received over* this road at. the United States Eastern -ports from ports on the Pacific coast 13,2i3,31 pounds of freight. Mr. Joseph Nimmo, Jr. former chief of the bureau of statistics, when be fore the senate select committee on rela tions with Canada April 26, 1890, said that "the value of goods thus .transported be tween different points in the United States across Canadian territory probably, amounts to more than $100,000,000 a year. There is no disposition on the part of the people or government of the United States to interfere in the smallest degree with the political relations of Canada. That question is wholly with her own people. It is time for us, however,,, to consider whether, If the present state of things and trend of things is to continue, our exchanges upon lines of land transportation should not bo put upon a different basis, and our entire independence of Canadian canals and of the St. Lawrence, as an outlet (to the sea se cured by the construction of an Amerl seaports. We should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our groat natural trade ad vantages. Wo should withdraw the sup port which is given to tbfc railroads and steamship lines of Canada by a traffic that properly belongs to us. and to no longer furnish the earnings which lighten tho oth erwise crushing weight of the enormous public subsidies that have been given to them. Tho subject of tho power of the treasury to dcpl with this matter without further legislation hns been under consider ation, hut circumstances have postponed a conclusion.e Ipropriety is probable that a considera tion1 1 of th of a modification or abrogation of the article of the treaty of Washington relating to the trnnslt of goods In bond is advisable as a complete solution ef tho uucslion. THE 

CHILEAN TROUBLE. Congress at tho last session was kept advised of the progress of the serious and for a time threatening differences between the United States and Chile. It gives me now great gratification to report that the Chilean, government in a most friendly and claims under Mexican, grants have so long If iMm: $* I i honorable spirit has tendered una paid as an indemnity to the families of lbe sailors of the Baltimore who were killed and to those who were injured in the outbreak to the city of Valparaiso the sum of $75,000. This has been accepted, not only as an indemnity for a wrong done, but as a most gratifying evi dence that the government of Chile rightly appreciates the disposition of this' govern ment to act in a spirit of absolute fairness and friendliness in our intercourse with that brave people. A further and conclusive evi dence of the mutuul respect and confidence now existing is furnished by the fact that a convention submitting to arbitration the mu tual claims of the citizens of the respective governments has been agreed upon. .Some of these claims have been pending for many years ancLhave been the occasion of much unsatisfactory diplomatic correspondence. DEPARTMENT -OF JUSTICE- ~fh"e~report or" ..no attorney" general Is by law submitted directjy to eorgress, but I cannot refrain from saying that he has eon ducted the inert aslng work of the depart ment of justice with great professional skill. He has in several directions secured from the courts decisions giving increased protection to the oitfeers of the United States and bringing some classes of 'crime that 'escaped local cognisance and punish m-at unto the tribunals the United States whilenumerous they could be tried ih applicationsinfoimpartiality. executive clemency presented In behalf of persons convicted fn the United States courts and given penitentiary sentences have called my attention to a fact referred to by tho attorney general in bis report, namely, that a time allowance for good behavior for such prisoners is presci-ibed by the federal stat utes only where the state In which the pen ite tiary is located had made no such pro vision. Prisoners are given the benefit of the provisions of the state law regulating the penitentiary to which they may he 'sent. These are various, some too liberal and some peihaps too illiberal. The result Is a sentence for five years means one thing if the prisoner is sen to one state for con finement and quite a different thing if le is sent to another. I leeomniend that a uni form credit for good behavior be prescribed by congress. The aggregate of claims pending against the government in the court of claims is enormous. Claims to the'amount of nearly $400,000,000 for the taking of or injury to the property of persons claiming to be loyal during the war are now before that court for examination. Wnen the otheis are added, the Indian depredation claims and the French spoliation claims, the aggregate is reached that is indeed startling. In the defense of these claims this government is at a disadvantage. The claimants have pre served their evidence, whereas the govern ment -has to send agents to rummage the field for what they can find. This difficulty is peculiarly great where the fact to be established is the disloyalty of the claimant during the war. If this great threat against our revenues is to have no other checa, cer tainly congress should supply the depart ment of justice with appropriations suffi ciently liberal to secure the best legal talent in the defense of the claims and to pursue it3 vague search for evidence effectively. OUR NEW NAVY. The report of the secretary of the navy exhibits great progress in the construction of our new navy. When the present secJe tary entered upon his duties only three mod ern steel vessels were In commission. The vessels since put in commission and to be put in commission during the winter will make a total of nineteen during Ails adminis tration of the department. During the cur rent year ten war vessels and three navy tugs have been launched, and during the four years twenty-nve vessels will havbeen launched. Two other large ships and a tor pedo boat are under contract and the work on them well advanced, and the four mon itors are awaiting only the arrival of their armor, which has been unexpectedly delayed or they would have been before this in com mission. Contracts have been let during this ad ministration, under the appropriations for the increase of the navy, including new ves sels and their appurtenances, to the amount of $35,000,000, and there has been expended during the same period for labor at na\y yards upon similar work $8,000,000, without the smallest scandal or charge of fraud or partiality. The enthusiasm and interest of our naval officers, both of the staff and line, have been greatly kindled. They re sponded magnificently to the confidence of congress, and have demonstrated to the world an unexcelled capacity to construct in ordnance and in everything involved in the building, equipping and sailing of great 'water,ships. At the beginning of Secretary Tracy's administratioa several difficult prob lems remained to be^ grappled with and 'solved before the efficiency in action of our ships could be secured. It is"believed that as the result of new processes in the con struction of armor plate our 'later ship^s will be clothed with defensive plates of higher resisting power than are found on ANY WAR 

VESSEL AFLOAT. We were without torpedoes. The testr have been made to asceitaiu the lelative efficiency of different consti uctions. and a toiptdo has been adopted and the work of eorstructicn is now biing carried on sue c.-ffully. We were without armor pieio ing shells, and without a shop constructed and eqtiipped the construction of them. We are now making what is belifvei to bo a projective supeiior to any before in use. A smokeless powder has been developed and a slpw burning powder for guns of large caliber. A high explosive, capable of use in si ells fired from service gvna, has been found and the manufacture of gua cotton has been developed so that the question of supply is no longer in doubt. The develop ment of a naval militia, which has been, or ganized in eight states and brought into ccdial and co-operative relation wiMi the navy, is another important achievement There are now enlisted in these organiza tions 1,800 men, and tliey are likely to be greatly extended. I recommend such legis lation and appropriations as will encourage and develop this movement. The recom mendations of the secretary will, I do aot doubt,, receive the friendly consideration of congress, for he has enjoyed, as he has deserved, the confidence of all those in terested In the development of our navy without any division on partisan lines. I earnestly express the hope that a work which has made such noble progress may not now be stayed. The wholesome influ ence for the peace and increased sense of security which our citizens domiciled in other lands feel when these magnificent ships under the American flag appear is already most gratefully apparent. The ships from our navy which will appear in the naval parade next April in the harbor of New York will be a convincing demonstra tion to the world that the United States is again a naval power. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT. The work of the interior department, al ways very burdensome, has been larger than ever before during the administration of Secretary Noble. The disability pension law, taking of the eleventh census, the opening of vast areas of Indian lands to set tlement, the organization of Oklahoma and the negotiations for the cession of Indian lands, furnishork some of the increased wT Ey particularachievee du of th and the results testify to the ability, fidelity and industry of the head of the department andhis efficient assistants. Several important agreements for the cession of Indian lands negotiated by the commission appointed under the act of March 2, 1889, are awaiting the action of congress. Perhaps the most important of these Is that for the cession of the Cherokee strip. -This region has been the .source of great vexation to the executive department, and friction ang great unrest to settlers who desire to occupy It and the Indians who as sert title. The agreement which has been made by the commission is perhaps the most satisfactory that could liave been reached. It will be noticed that it is con ditioned upon its ratification by congress be fore March-=4, 1893. The secretary of the In terior, who has given 43fte Stibjec very care ful thought, recqntmenas the ratification of the agreement, and I am inclined to follow his roconfmendatlon. Certain it Is that some action by which this controversy shall bo brought to on end and these lauds opened to settlement is urgent. The,foKm,of.cp^emmpnt provided by con gross* on May 17, iSsOor Alaska wos, In Its frame and purpose, temporary. The increase of population and the development of some Important mining and commercial Interests make it imperative that the law be revised and better provision made for the arrest and punishment of criminals. The report of the so letary shows a very gratifying state of affairs as to the condition of the g. neral laud office. The work of is suing agricultural patents, which seemed to be hopelessly in arrears when the present secretary undertook the duties of his oflice, has been so expedited that the bureau is now upon current business. The relief thus afforded to honest and worthy settlers upon the public lands, by giving to them an as sured title to their entries, has been of In calculable benefit lu developing the new states and the territories. The court of private land claims, estab lished by congress for the promotion of this policy of .speedily settling contested land titles, is making satisfactory progress in its work, and when the work is completed a great impetus will be given to the develop ment of those regions where unsettled n*mft?Vi exertifffN! their repressive Influence. When all results .ore added, the enormous cessions of Indian lands which bare been opened to settlement, aggregating during this admin istration nearly 26,000,000 acres and the agreements negotiated and now pending in congress for raflfioation, by which about ten million additional acres will be opened to settlement, it will be seen how much has been accomplished. The report of the commissioner of pen sions, to which extended notice Is given by tho beeretary of tue Interior in bis report, will attract great attention. Judged by the aggregate amount of work done, the last year has been tho greatest lu the history of the office. I believe that the organization of the officers is efficient and that the work bus been done with fidelity. The passage of what is known as the disability bill, bas, as was foreseen, very largely increased the an nual disbursements to the disabled veterans of the civil war. Tho estimate for this fis cal year was $144,950,000 and that amount was appropriated. A deficiency amounting to $10,058,621 must be provided for at this session. The estimate for pensions for tho fiscal year ending June 80T 1894, is $165,- 000,000. The commissioner of pensions be lieves that if the present methods are main tained and further additions to the pension laws ore not made, the maximum expendi tures for pensions will be reached June 30, 1894, and will be at the highest point $188,- 000,000 per annum. 

QUARANTINE REGULATIONS. The subjoct of quarantine regulations, in spection and control was brought suddenly to my attention by the arrival at our ports In August last of vessels infected with chol era. Quarantine regulations should be uniform at all ports. Under the constitution they are plainly within the exclusive federal Juris diction when aud so far as congress will legislate. In my opinion the whole subject should be taken into national control, and adequate power given to the executive to protect people against plague invasions. On the 1st of September last I approved regulations establishing a twenty-day quar antine for all vessels bringing immi grants from foreign ports. This order will be continued in force. Some loss aud suffering have resulted fo passen gers, but a due care for the homes of our people justifies in such cases the utmost pre caution. There is danger that with the com ing spring, cholera will again appearand a liberal appropriation should be made at this session to enable our quarantine and port officials to exclude the deadly piague. But the most careful and stringent quaran tine regulations may not be sufficient ab solutely to exclude the disease. The progress of medical and sanitary science has been such, however, that if approved precau tions are taken at once to put all of our cities and towns in the best sanitary condi tion, and a provision is made for isolating any sporadic cases and for a thorough dis infection, an epidemic con, I am sure, be avoided. This work appertains to the local authorities, and the responsibility and the penalty will be appalling if it is neglected or unduly delayed. W are peculiarly subject I our great orts to the spread of infectious diseases reason of the fact that unrestricted im migration brings to us out of European cities in. the overcrowded steerages of great steamships a large number of persons whose surroundings make them the easy victims of the plague. This consideration, a wellesas those affecting the political, moral and in dustrial interests ofo country, lead me to renew the suggestion that admission, to our country to the high privileges of its citizenship should be more restricted "and mor,e9 careful. We have, I think, a right tand a pecially to our working people, not only to keep out the vicious, the ignorant, the civil disturbers the .pauper and the contract laborer, but to check the too great flow of immigration now coming by further limita tions. NICARAGUA CANAL. I repeat with great earnestness the rocomnurdation which I have made in seveial previous messages that prompt and adequate support be given the American company engaged in the construction of the Mcasagua ship canal. It Is impossible to o^ei state the value from every stand point of this great enterprise, and I hope that there may be time, even in this con gress, to give to it an impetus that will insure the early completion of the canal and seenre to the United States its proper lolations to it when completed. Congress has been already advised that the invitations of this government for the assembling of an international monetary conference to consider the question of an enlarged issue of silver was accepted bv the nations to which they were Issued1 The conference, assembled at Brussels on' the 22d of November, and has entered upon the consideration of this great ques tion. I have not doubted, and have talien occasion to express that belief, aS* well in the invitations issued for this conference as in my public messages, that the free coinage of silver upon an agreed interna tional ratio would greatly promote the in teiests of our people and equally those of other nations. It is too early to predict what results may be accomplished by the conference. If any temporary che-- or de lay itervenes, I believe that very soon conrmercial conditions will compel the now reluctant governments to unite with us in' this movement to secure the enlargement of the volume of money needed for the trans action of the business of the world. PURITY OF THE BALLOT. I have, in each three annual messages which it has been my duty to submit to con gress, called attention to the evils and dan gers connected with our election methods and practices as they are related to the choice of officers of the national government. In my last annual message, I endeavored to invoke serious attention to the evils of un fair apportionments for congress. I cannot close this message without again calling at tention to these grave and threatening evils. I had hoped that it was possible to secure a non-partisan inquiry, by means of a com mission, Into evils the existence of which is known to all, and that out of this might grow legislation from which all thought of partisan advantages should be eliminated and only the higher thought appear, of maintaining the freedom and purity of the ballot and the equality of the elector with out the- guaranty of which the government could never have been formed, and without the continuance of which it cannot continue to exist in peace and prosperity, it is time that mutual charges of unfairness and fraud between the great parties should cease and that the sincerity of those who profess a de-j sire for pure and honest elections should bo brought to the test of their willingness to free our legislation and our election methods from everything that tends to impair the public confidence in their announced "result. The necessity for an inquiry and for legis lation by congress upon this subject is emj phaslzed by the fact that the tendency of legislation in some states in recent years has in some important particulars been away from and not toward free and fair elections and equal apportionments. Is it not time that we should come together upen the high plane of patriotism while we devise methods that shall secure the right of any man qual ified by law. TO CAST A FREE BALLOT and give to every such ballot an equal value In choosing our public officers and In direct-* ing the policy of the government? Lawless ness is not less such, but more, where it usuips fhe,functions of the peace officer and*" of the courts. TJie frequent lynchings of colorea people accused of crime is without the excuse which has sometimes been urged by niqhs for a failure to pursue the ap pointed methods for the -punishment of crime .that the accused has had an undue influence over courts^and Juries. Such acts are a reproach to the community where they occur, and BO far as they can be.ajade sub ject of federal jurisdiction the strongest re pressive legislation is demanded. A public sentiment that will sustain the officers of the law in resisting mobs and protecting ac cused persons in their custoqy should bo promoted by every possible means. The of ficer who gives his life in the brave dis charge of this duty is worthy of special ^honor. No lesson needs to be so urgently im pressed upon our people as this, that no worthy end or cause can be promoted by lawlessness. This exhibit of the .work of the executivo department is submitted to congress and to the public in the hope that .there will be found in it a due sense of responsibility and nn earnest purpose to maintain the national honor and to promote the happiness and prosperity of alt our people. And this brief exhibit of the growth and prosperity of the country will give us a level from which to note the increase or decadence that new leg' lslatlve policies may, bring to us. There is no reason why the national influence, power and prosperity should not observe the same rates of increase that have characterized the past thirty years. We carry the great impulse and increase of these years into the future. There is, no reason why in many lines of the production we should not sur pass nil other nations, as we have alrendy done In some. There nA nea^ frontier- wUTSTor BENJAMIN HARRISON.

All his friends were ve*. oorry he was so stingy, and talked v. him about it but he couldn't see any reason why he should giveaway what he wanted himself. "If I didn't want it," he would say, p'r'aps I would give it awaybu why should I give it away when I want it myself?" "Because it is nice to be generous said his mother, "and thi nk about the happiness of other people. I ntakes you feel happier and better yourself. If you give your sled to lit tle ragged Johnny, who neyer had one in his life, you will feel a thousand times better watching his enjoyment of it than if you had kept it yourself." "Well," said Jimmy, "I'll try it." The sledwent off. "How soon shali 1 feel better?" he asked, by and by I don't feel as well as I did when I had the sled. Are you sure I shall feel better?" "Certainly," answered his mother, "but if you should keep on giving something away you would feel better all the sooner." Then he gave away his kite, and thought he did not feel quite so well as before. gave away his silver piece he meant to spend for taffy. Then he said: I don't like this giving things it doesn't agree with me. I don't feel any better. Ilikebeingstingy better." Just then ragged Johnny came up the street dragging the sled, looking proud as a prince^ and asking all the bo ys to take a slide with him, and taid: "You might give Johnny my old overcoat he's littler than "lam, aivl he doesn't seem to ha ve one.

The recently published "Memorial s" of Mrs. Polk, the wife of the eleventh president of the United States, de scribes an adventu re which for a few minutes threatened the life of the fu ture "lady of the White House." Her husband was then a member of Con gress, and the pa ir were riding in a coach in Tennessee. The driver ventured into a swollen stream, where presently the horses got beyond their depth and com menced swimming. A little more, and the coach would h^ve been engulfed. At that moment a man came up the bank on horseback, and shouted to the driver to sto p. The danger seemed imminent, a nd Mr. Polk, who could not swim, called out from his seat inside the coach, of fering any amount of money to any one who would save his wife. The man on horseback seemed afraid to venture to the rescue, but Mr. Gran ville Pillow, who was sittina beside Mrs. Polk, threw off his coat, exclaim- ing,"! will take you out, madam." swam to thebank^ compelled the man to give up hiahorse. mounted it, plunged i the rapid current, came up behind the'stage, and told Mrs. Polk to step on the high hind wheel, and thence upon the shoulder of the horse. held her firmly inhis arms, a nd borehei safely totfce bank.
