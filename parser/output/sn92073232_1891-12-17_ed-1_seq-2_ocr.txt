But np to Monday nhxht last $05,000 worth had been drawn out and shipped to other points. It is said that tht penny-in-the-slot business caused a greater demand for them. Unity is just as essential in the Democratic majority of the house as if that majority were not ov erwhelmingly larjre. To allow the breaches created by the speakership fight to go unclosed will certainly imperil, if it does not make impossible, Democratic success in '92. A long, a very long time ago, Russell Harrison's paper an nounced. that Blaine's f jrmal re fusal of the presidential nomina tion would soon be forthcoming. Months and months have passed, and Blaine i yet silent. His si lence, it may be, speaks louder than words. bays the Chicago Herald on the President's message : The message, unlike the soul of wit, is long; and unlika charity, it begins abroad, according to immemorial custom. Beginning abroad it stays there to the lim it of four columns, or not much less than one half the entire length of the document, roaming all the way from Russia to Hawaii. 

BATLBOAD COMMISSIONERS. The Iowa commissioners claim that railroad earnings in "that state have increased $6,000,000 in the two years since rates were made by the commission, and that for the three preceding years, when the companies made their own rates, there was a decrease. Well this is iiist about what most sensible people expected, that the workings of- the com missioners would tend to increase the net earnings of the railroad companies. But then the com missioners tret good salaries so they are not kicking especially about what the railroads earn. We have a little home affair of a railroad commission in our state. Its a good place and its good pay but who will erer hear of mos't friendly spirit, and the "latest information is that con stitutioual government has been re-established without blood shed." 6. Thelynching at New Or leans of eleven members of the Mafia Society is. spoken of as "deplorable and discreditable.' He believes that a friendly con clusion of theunsettled questions with Italy is "attainable." The withdrawal of the Italian Minis ter from Washington is referred to as "tht temporary absence of the Minister Plenipotentiary of Italy." He thinks it "would be entirely competent for Congres to make offences against the treaty-rights of foreigners domi ciled in the United States cogniz able in the Federal courts." It seems to him, in the absence of such a law, "that, the officers of the State charged with police and jucicial powers in such cases must, in the consideration of in temational questions, be regard ed as Federal agents," and this view "makes this Government answerable for their act where it would be answerable if the United States had used its con stitutional power to define and punish crime against treaty rijrhta." The whole tone of this part of the message is concilia tory, and is intended, no doubt, to cause Italy to resume the cor- responden 7. Much is said concerning our relations with Chile. The Itnta incident is rehearsed. The poli -v of the Government with refer ence to Balmaceda is defended. "No official complaint f the con duct of our Miuister, or of our naral officers during the strug gle has been present, d to thi Government. The treatment ot our .Minister ior a rime was such as to call for a decided pro test, aud thereupon the "un friendly measures" were relaxed. The attack upon our sailors at Valparaiso is related at some length. A correspondence had with the Chilean Government eyoked a letter "in an offensive tone." At present he is await- mgthe result of the investigation being madein theCriminal Court of alparaiso, and he will, if nee essary, send in a special message on tnetubject. 8. I here is an insurrection in China and violence has been done to some foreigners. The Chinese Government h.s declined is "still" of the opinion "that the free coinage of silver would dis astrously affect our business in terests at home and abroad. full corn-use of silver should be made "just as soon as the co-op nation of other nations can be secured and a ratio fixed that will give circulation equally to gold and silver. Our circula tion per capita is now $24.38 15. The War Department through its Secretary reports that desertions from th. army are now" fewer than ever before in its history. Progress is being made in shore defences. It is re commended that smokeless pow der and better rifles be given the enlisted men. The e"penmentu enlisting Indians has been satis iactory. mere are now seven companies and sevtn more are being organized. 16. Chinese are still stealing into the United States bv way oi British Columbia. Defects in the law should be remedied. 17. He recommends that the jurisdiction of the United States Con 'ts be extended so "as to make triable therein any felonv committed while in the act of violating a law of the United States." This refers to the kill ing of court officers, jurors, &c. while in the discharge of their duties. 18. Various postal reforms are recommended including free de liveries in smaller., cities and towns. He also recommends "a modified use of the telegraph" in connection with the postal ser vice, b-iccess is claimed for the ocean-mail subsidy law. li). lo our Navy the Newark, Concord, Bennington, and Mian- Kmomah have been added during the year with an aggregate of more than ll.UOO tons, while twenty-four war-ships of all classes are now under construc tion in the navy-yards and pri vate shops. K a r rmi I w 1 zv. ine inaian uuestion is briefly discussed and schools and farms for them, suggested. He also intimates his belief that the five independent tribes should accept citizenship and be given a representative ia Congress. 21. The administration of the Pension Bureau, he says, "has been charaterized by great dil igence." 1 nenumber of pensions January 1, 1891, was 676,160. 22. A commission for dealing with subsidized railroads against which the Government has claims is recommended. 23. The Census Bureau's work is commended as "careful and in- that ie was "a participant, while " anV, alIe8ed thafc. osivt n l tn thaanortfmnAf if itnii I "CMS Chinese laws. This view thei President holds to be untenable. 9. He recommends thatwe ac cept Spain's invitation to partic ipate in the celebration, at Ma drid in 1892. of the fnnr-hnnrl. - i - i Ci.j i 't.

It was a very eco nomical legislature that appoin ted it, that is so to speak, when you have no special inclination to btvhV fhf tmrh. The members A. - went in as a farmers legislature, a kind of economical .movement on a reform basis, and they got there Eli to a tune of increased taxes of about sixty., thousand dollars and in order to meet this increase expenditure' a tax was levied upon the gross earnings of the day laborer. A. thing that -would " have been pretty well suited as an emergency, tor raise money to feed a starving' army, but it comes in bad taste in time of peace.' . - " - The railroad commitaiori is a ' od thing to exliaust state -Vill it do any oth:r friendly spirit, but witk much earnentness, to the Government of the Czar its serious concern be cause of the harsh measures now beings enforced against the He- I rews in Kussia. . "It is estima ted that over one -million will be forced from Russia in a.few years ' - - . -. .- . - .' 11. The jNicnraguan Uanal en terprise is commended.

A Constitutional Amend ment regulating the election of electors for President and Vice President is recommended. An offensive patronizing air to ward foreign governments, a narrow centralizing bias in home politics, a nauseously self-complacent satisfac tion with the exploits of the present admiaistration . and " the reoom menclation of a non parti zan Force Bill, which in the end, should it be come a law, would be nothing better than a sugar coated 'dose .with the i a me ingredients, as the one prepared y the last Republican CQngress, are the moft striking; teatures ot as ry and platitudinous . a .message as was ever fird at a community by the. chief executi ye of a great coun- try. it u a strong republican doc ument, aud the intense partisanship of,the. author shows through "every line. .

As to the McKinley tari3. r e aocamenc are wey wormy oi "rtdttatbtica araproduccd to public attert:on. New York Times, ind.: That the independent vote which has poured into the exhausted frame of the old Democratic party thi new strength show by the greal majority in the House can be re tained if the forces that have dominated the Dem cratic cau cus are to control the action of the party in Congress and out of it i-, of course, impossible. The election of Mr. Crisp by the coali tion of the demagogy of Hill, the spoilsmongering of Tainmany, the protectionism of G irnian and Briee, the half-corrupt half fanatijal free-silver movement and the old South must inevit tably 'give pause', to the men who have believed that the Dem ocratic party would be a fit in strumentality for the accomp lishment of tariff reform and fo the clean and honest administra tion of the government. New Yotk Herald, ind.: All this Jbdlloting.has been worse than useless. The object of the Representatives has not been to elect a fitting and Veil-equipped chairman simply, but to push the claims of Mr. Cleveland or Mr. Hill in the coming "presidential campaign. The fight was wag ed in the interest of a favorite candidate, who stood in the background, but who hopes to come to the front next year. In other vords, the sole purpose in view has been to tell the people of this country that they shall vote on this and thatissue, for this man or that man, in 1892, and for no other issue and no other man. New York World, deni. : Ob stinate as the contest has been, it has involved no vital question, no question whatever of broad party policy. All the candidates have been men who are of one mind as to the great issue of present politics. All are tariff reformer, inflexibly opposed to the monstrous system of protec tive legislation embodied in law by the billion-dollar Congress All clealy understand the com mission given t o the Democratic party by the people in the extra ordinary v te of 1890. None is clearer in this understanding or more faithfully devoted to the execution ot that commission AT THE

I was told at the Treasury Depart ment this morning that the Exami ner's report on the condition of the First National Bank of Wilmington had not yet been received and that nothing would be done until the re port was in and examined. If the directors make necessary arrange ments. the Bank will be allowed to resume business, it not, a receiver wdl be appointed and the gentleman will probably be Mr. W..S. O. B.

Tbei-e were 800 people of various naiionaiitias, in cluding Russians, Poles. Bohemians, Italians, Jews, Germans and a fow Americans. In an inflamatOTr speech Mrs. 1 arsons scored the mayor, the police and the capitalistic presc, and, pointing to an American flaij imme diately above her, she said: That flag is an infamous lie.

Every stsjr in that flajr is but to hi 4 party in Congress in ac eepting this nomination were a pledge to "take no step back ward in tariff reform." The Richmond Times, dem.: The nomination of Mr. ("Visp for Speaker of the House of Repre tatives was a tribute to the ster ling Democracy of that gentle man, and to his great personal popularity, and it was a victory of which his friends may well be proud. The Democracy of Mr. Crisp cannot be doubted. His earnest and able fight against the force bill in tho Fifty-first Congress entitles him to the last ing gratitude of his party, while his acknowledged ability is a guarantee that he will adminis ter his high office with honor to himself, his party and his coun try The Washington Post, rep.: n the nomination of Mr. Crisp the Democrats have made selec tion of a Speaker who will do honor to the position and dis charge its duties to the entire ac ceptationof both majority and minority. He has served upon the bench and is a man of emi nently judicial temperament. He has been eight years in Congress, one of the foremost members of that body in usefulness, ability and leadership, and is an excel lent parliamentarian. - Philadelphia Press, rep.: But the anti-Cleveland end of the par ty has won a great victory. It is doe partly to the fear of tt.e party to enter upon a" campaign under the banner of Roger Q. Mills,., and partly to the skillful eadership of those democrats who are not .' willing to have Grover Cleveland again nomina ted for the presidency.

Why They Emigrate. It is a significant fact, t hat a great many of the immigrants from Europe who are now arriving say that they have been induced to emigrate through the fear that there will be a war in Europe next year: AVhethea these immigrants really know any thing about the prospect of war may be questioned, but it would seem clear that where there 1 general 1 fear among the people tnat war is imminent there must be some foun dation for it. The leading nations of continental Europe are under such a heavy strain to preserve their milita ry establishments that it would not be surprising if they were to seek relief in war. If so, they would be prompt ed by- tbe hop4? that a war would so far settle international European Questions that there would no longer be any necessity for the maintenance of large standing armies lor the pres ervation of peace. Bever Republican. King of Medicines Scrofulous Humor A. Cure -"Almost Miraculous." " When I was 14 years oi age I bad a severe attack of rheumatism, and after I recovered had to go on crotches. A year later, scrofula, in the form of white swellings, appeared on various parts of my body, and for 11 years I was an invalid, being confined to my bed years. In that time ten or eleven sores ap peared and broke, causing me great pain and suffering. I feared I never should get well. " Early in 18S6 1 went to Chicago to visit a sister, but was confined to my bed most of the time I was there. In July I read a book, A Day with a Circus,' in which were statements of cures by Hood's Sarsaparilla. I was so Im pressed with the success of this medicine that I decided to try it. To my great gratification the sores soon decreased, and I began to feel better and in a short time I was up and out of doors. I continued to take Hood's Sar saparilla for about a year, when, having used six bottles, I had become so fully released from the disease that I went to work for the Flint St Waning MIg. Co., and since then 

BATS HOT LOST A SINGLE DAT on account of sickness. I believe the disease 13 expelled from my system, I always feel wen, am in good spirits and have a good appetite. I am now 27 years of age and car. walk as well as any one, except that one limb Is a little shorter tlian the other, owing to the loss of bone, and the sores formerly on my right leg.
