They did not wait for any encounter with our reinforcements. Reports sent about Gen. Blcnkcr's resi"- -nation are incorrect. Gen. McClellan and Blenkcr's command have the greatest confi- dence in him, and Lis resignation would not be accepted if offered. The affair grew out of -a .letter sent by General Dlcnkcr to 'General McClellan, which contained ex pressions which General McClellan rebuked 'Iiitn'for, but said he presumed it was Gen. Blenker's impel feet knowledge of English which caused the impioper expressions, and the affair is considered satifactorily "settled. The rebel Uiigadier-Gcneral George B. L-iittcndcn, brother of John J. Crittenden, Federal General, has been promoted to a Major Generalship, and assigned to the department of-Oumberland Gap. The lebel -convention at Itussellville, Kentucky,-made a Declaration of Indepen dence, passed an Ordinance of Secession, and adopted resr.lutnns declaring that the laws and Constitution of Kentucky were not consistent -vuii tue acts or the rebel Govern mciit. The privateer Suniplcr is reported cop tured off the CQzil of Texas by the frigate jNiaga:a. Adjutant General Thomas sent instruc tions to Gencrr.l Sherman at Beaufort, to take possession -of all crops on the island, and to ship cotton and other crops not .wanted for the army to New Yoik, to be sold for Government use. The slaves are to secure the crops. The rebels are falling back from the Potomac before the slow but certain ad vance of the Union forces. They have hardly offered resistance to our vessels the last few da-s. Tho Richmond Dispatch reports three thousand Unionists in the mountains of East Tennessee, under Parson Brownlow and Major Gillham, doing moic mischief !, than the Yankees in Kentucky. The Dispatch proposes the abandonment I of Norfolk, in tho event of an attack, and ,j begs the reinforcement of Richmond and il9 Yorktown. Thirty thousand troops are expected at Fortress Monroe, and an order was read to those there on Monday that they will not be furnished winter quarters. This seems to indicate an advance. rm. wr,.i.: i. n 7 7 i II from Winchester, Virginia, stating that Jackson, one of the rebel Generals, is drill ing a regiment composed wholly of slaves in that city, and that the negroes arc to be made to fight against the Federal troops. According to present indications the president's Message will not bo seut henee iu advance of deliver to Congress. The reason for this is the fact that it, as well as the reports of the Secretaries of War and Navy will be kept until the latest moment in order to make such additions and altera tions as the constantly recurring events may require. Dispatches received to day at the Navy Department from Flag-officer Dupont, dated Port Royal, November 25th, gives the gratifying intelligence that the flag of the United States is flying over the territory of the State of Georgia. Tybee island which ho says is within easy mortar distance of Fort Pulaski has been taken possession of and the approaches to Savannah completely cut off. On the island is a strong martillo tower with a battery at its base. Dispatches to the New York Herald says that Fort Pickens opened fire on Saturday cjnorning, but the firing was wild. It was stated that Pickens had been breeched when the firing ceased. The reb els sustained no loss, but the loss of the Union forces was heavy. The wildest excitement existed at Norfolk. Brag had sent congratulatory dispatches all over the South. From the same source it is learned that at 15eauiort three compa- nies of Sherman's command had an engage- j jnent with the rebels, and were forced to retreat, with a loss of eight men. Beaufort is being entrenched by our forces. )t ttitixnt. --.-, -

We would call the attention of pleasure goers to the announcement in another column, of a grand Cotillion Party to be given at Wil son's Hall, Christmas Eve. Being acquainted with the gettcrs-up of -the affair, and knowing their taste for such matters, we predict a pleas ant time to all who attend. STATE ITEMS. The enormous vote cast at Lawrence at the late election is still a matter of dispute among the papers of the eastern portion of the State. The Republican and Journal of Lawrence are Btill harping on the subject, and indulging in ill-natured flingl at one another about it. Give it a legal airing, gentlemen, or else " dry up." The Journal advocates the remission of the war tax apportioned to Kansas. A correpondent in the same paper gives some very good end patriotic reasons for not asking its remission, but nbt sufficient we think to counterbalance the inability of our people to pay the tax. It was rumored in Leavenworth that General Lane had been captured in Missouri by the rebels, who had hung and quartered him. The public mind will be greatly eased by the an nouncement of his safe arrival in Chicago. Captain Abernathy's company, Eighth regi ment, made a haul of two noted Javhawkers-, named Gale and Trickey, at Topeka. Horesea and mules were found in their possession, and other evidences of guilt observed. They were taken to the camp in Lawrence, where they were placed in close confinement. The Burlington Register gives tht! official vote of Coffee county, Crawford and the State ticket received 532 votes every vote in the county. We clip the following items of State news froni the Times and Conservative : Lane's Brigade, excepting Colonel Judsoh's regiment, has left Fort Scott, and is marching m onn near tne border. The order for the removal of the First Kansas regiment from Tipton to Kansas, has been coun termanded by General Halleck. It will remain for the present at Tipton. Brigadier-General James W. Denver, at one time Governor of the Territory, has arrived at for the I Leavenworth. He has been assigned to a com- It is pro- mand in this Department. General Denver is a man of decided ability, and we doubt not, will greatly distinguish himself as a commander. He has been eminently successful in every posi tion in life that he has held, (and he has held many public offices of high trust.) "We doubt not that his military career will add lustre to his name. Let our people feel assured that if General Hunter they have the right man in the right place. He i at work vigorously, surely, and in ine ngnc direction.

These, with the West ern troops going forward, will swell the vt cstern and southwestern armies to vast proportions. Out of those pushing on into Missouri, another wing will be formed, un der a new cotnmarid, to proceed with the new gun boats and transport steamers down the Mississippi during the autumn months.

At least the people will not expect such conduct from the officers who serve in their armies.'' Iu a recent speech in New York, Briga dier General Iiurnside, of lthode Island, a Democrat, said: " We have had it thrown in our face tbrtt tne very cause of this rebellion is a strength to the enemy.

Jayhawking. This term has hecome vul garized. The word originated among the Free State settlers during the dark days of Border Ruffian misrule, who were manfully comhatting the agressions of the Slave power, and devoting all their energies towards dedicating our fair prairies to Free Labor. Its definition is, ' the accomplishment of justice "by irregular means." The settlers then meant by it, all honorable means, in warfare, of crippling their oppres sors. Now, it is applied to all manner of Crime, from the stealing of a pin te that of a horse, and the pillaging of a city. We hear reports from different portions of this and Dickinsos county of tho arrival of strange horses, which are offered for sale at unusually low prices. Such animals are "jay hawked." or in plainer lan guage, stolen. We would therefore warn ow people against investing largely in horse flesh at the present time. Its " mighty unsartain," and there is no telling when the real owner may come along and relieve you of the charge.
