What Kisd f a Government Have We 1 This (|UCBlioo wualil pimlc the Wain I (f the meet sfcious, and we doubt if satisfactory answer could be given. I lint, aa the will of Congress is the u | preste law of the hind, aud that will be ing swayed by Jiutlor, Sumner and Wil i sou, wo thiub it ia nearer a triumvirate 1 than anything elao. There was a time when the I‘resident J was a barrier to linooottitutisoal legts ; hit too, but that time has passed. Gen ii era! Grant has thrown himself at the [ feet of Cawgrcss and promises to do ’ their bidding. By promising “ rigid • tidherencc to the law" ho virtually gives I up the veto power. All he wauls is to I hate the tenure of-ofiicc act repealed, I so that he may appoint his relations to • office, and his is willing to strictly cn | farce the laws of Congress, uo matter - whether they are just or adjust. If | Congress grants this only wish of the • President, they may make soy laws they choose and ho will cause a “ rigid • adherence" to them. One brooch of | the government has thus given in to Congress, and the other—the Supreme Court—ia in danger of being made to ncquicsoe. Already two bills have been presented to Congress to limit its juris- I diction. One, presented by Mr. Sum • nor, deprircs the court of all jurisdic lion over appellate cases brought before it on writs of kubeo* enrptu- The oth -1 or, introduced by Mr. Drake, is still more sweeping. It provides “ that no I court created by an act of Congress, or , judge thereof, shall have power iu any t ease to adjudge or hold any uct or joint I resolution of Congress invalid, in whole • or id part, for any supposed repugnancy between such act or joint resolution and I llie Constitution of the United Slates, or J forauy supposed want cfautbority iu said t onstitution for the same. Nor shall the appellate jurisdiction of the Su preiis Court of the United Stales be , construed to authorise that Court, in a*y ante now pending, or hereafter before it, (u affirm that any or dcr, judgment or decree shall, for that t|tusc, bo reversed, vacated and annull ed. Nor shall any juatice of said Su pronto Court, in furtherance of the ox etcistj of such appellate jurisdiction make any order, or authorize or issue aoy writ or process, nr taks any pro ceeding based upon any such adjudging or bolding by him, or by the said Su preme Court." The States, too, have lost their sover eignty. The President in bis message to Congress recommends (he reconstruc lion uf Gegia. She has been rcoa strutted once, and formally admitted in to the Union, yet her representatives haw been denied their seats because she has not rstiied the Fifteenth Amendment. Rejecting this Amend ment constitutes her disloyalty and she must undergo souther process of re coo struction. What right has Congress to force the Southern States to edopt the IBth Amendment, any than she has to •wake New York, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, or any other State ? She baa none, and she knows it. They dare not attempt such a thing in these States, aud it is only because they know that the Southern States can't help themselves, and have to submit before Congress end the federal bsyoests, that they force (hem to adopt measures so averse to their convictions, asd make tools of them that they may keep in power and eorry out their cotigna. lennesace. Which hUs lately rejected, the 15th Amendment, we suppose, will also have to undergo another rcmcdel llng.aa General Butler, chairman of ihe reconstruction committee, said lately, is reply to a delegation from Virginia wishing to have that State admitted, “it has been given out (hat I intended to oppose the admission of Virginia ; this is incorrect, lam only desirous tobecautiuus. Congress admitted Geor gia, and shs has broken her faith; she adopted the constitution and gare all her citizens free and eryaal right*, but as soon as she was admitted lute the sisterhood of States she Dot only abro gated many of the republican princi ples of hor constitution, but denied the right to colored members to hold seats in the Legislature. Georgia has gained admission by fraud, and as ail frauds eon he and most bo summarily dealt with, Congress will onmpell Georgia to keep hor plighted faith.

If the proposed interference with Georgia be interpreted as no more than proper, aud * within (ho purview of the powc* of f Congress, then indeed the States are at j ■ an cods even in the mildest form of , * their existence. Our Commerce. Before the late unhappy civil war our cominerciul marine exceeded that of any other country, England not ex oepted. The Uuitcd States hud a grea ter amount of tonage than any other nation, and it was our pride and boast that we were the greatest luaratiuio power of the world. The commerce of 1 the country was chiefly iu the hands of * New England, and its profits helped to * swell her plethoric coffers. Hut the * war came—a New England war, iu its origin at least—and our handsome clip pers were swept from the seas. Our rich argosies were the prey of the Ala baoias and the Florida* set utio.it by that unnatural strife, aud all the boats i |. which were not captured were speedily disposed of to foreigners, and put to sea * under the flags of foreign power. A high destructive tariff, another New England measure, was urged through Congress to meet the war debt, and the ; duty oo much of the material required j .for boat building so enhanced the price of that species of properly, as to make it unprofitable, if not ruinous, to engage j iu it to any exteut. Thu consequence • , arc, that our ship yards arc idle, aud our gallant tars have sought employ- | 1 moot abroad, and our commerce ia not J restored. New England policy, for once, , has over readied itself But, it is seek , ing to regain, in another way, wh.it it has lost through the tariff and the ‘ war. Congress is to be urged to grant subsidies to ocean steamers, and plans!- i blc but unsound arguments arc not 1 wanting to commend such a "policy to 1 that body. The Treasury of the United j States is expected to pay back to New I England, the sum of wealth which New 1 England cupidity has lost. But this ‘ expedient will out avail to restore a J ruined commerce, even though a plastic ] Congress should grant their requests, i The tariff must bo greatly modified, and our currency brought to a specie stand ard, so that labor will not bo so far in excess of European rates as to exclude I our industrious ship builders from a 1 fair competition with those of other ' countries, before wo can regain what , we have lost and reinstate ourselves in t our former prosperous mnmtimc coudi- I tiou. Temporary expedients, or special ‘ legislation, will not cure the evil; there must be a thorough change iu our policy, if wc would again secure the largest * share of the commerce of the world.— ( It is strange that the New England , mind, over alive to its material interests, I controlling as it docs the policy of this ' country, has not perceived this truth. * aud squared its action accordingly. A blind fatuity, however, seems to lead it, j like the will-o’-the wisp, over the bogs and feus of error. W e.stkun Maryland 11. It—An 1 ordinance is now before the City Coon oil of Baltimore, authorizing and re- j quiriug the Register of the city to s endorse or guarantee the bonds of the 1 \\ estern Maryland Railroad Company, c for the sum of $1,300,000. This or ' dioance has to be submitted to the Leg Ulataro for their action, aud if an act 1 is passed by them, authorizing such cn- * dorsement, then it goes before the peo * pie of the city of Baltimore for their a approval or disapproval. We hope this 1 question will soon get before the peo pie, when, we have uo doubt, this aid will be quickly giv.u us. by -i ♦ i U the Union a Curse —Here is ' 1 the way the New York Pbut “goes for’' ; those who urge the necessity of a higher i tariff for protection : If there is any such necessity for i “ protecting” industry as some people ‘ | imagine, it would seem that such pro . tection is far more urgently needed be ' tweeu the States of this Union than 1 between our country and others separa ted from it by a wide ocean. about a quarter more, for instance, to produce iron io Pennsylva nia than in Missouri Ought not the poor Pennsylvania us to tie protected against the Missourians ? Cotton goods can bo produced more cheaply in Mas sachusetts than in Michigan; ought not j the Michigan manufacturers to be pro- j tested against their rival* in the East? i Again, if “protection” is necessary | to establish “intant manufactures,” do not the ftouthern States need to be pro tected against the Northern ? Do not the Western States need protection against the Eastern? ft is oo wonder some of the protec- i tionist chiefs were willing to “let the i 805th go” io 1861. Oo their theory, t to destroy the Union would have been to benefit all the fragments of it. j t mt { Alabama Legislature.—ln the i House on Friday last, Mr. Brown, dem- i ocrat, of Chambers, war voted out of his seat and was refused the privilege < of spreading his protest on the journal. .

In the House, the various subjects mentioned in the Presidents message were referred to appropriate committees Hills were introduced and referred to reorganise the Treasury Department; to repeal the tenure of office act; to es tablish a uniform system of naturalise lion ; to prohibit sales of coin in behalf of tho foiled Slates, and to provide for the redemption nf legal tender notes in emu at par. Messrs Heflin, Dos, Hays and Shenard, members elect from Alabama, were admitted to their seals The Senate on Wednesday, the Bth, elected the members of the several standing committees ns previously sc looted by the republican caucus. A lining the bills introduced and referred was one to repeal the lost oath act. Mr. Kerry, who introduced this hill, made some very sensible remarks on tlie sub ject. A resolution was adopted request mg the committee on military affairs to inquire whether any legislation is nec essary to secure to colored citizens who j have served in the armies of the United i M l ua * 1 iglils with white citizens. | The joint resolution to remove all polili | oal disabilities upon the ratification of j the til tee nth amendment was, after some ; debate, adopted .V resolution was in .

It was referred to the committee on wavs and means I -fir. Cobb, ol North Carolina, offered a , resolution in favor of the recognition of the independence of Cuba, and declaring that the House will support the Presi dent of tho United States in iis recog liitioi). ihe rcsoluliau was not enter tallied.

The census bill was then tukeu up in committee of tho whole, when a spirited debate ensued, but no result was‘arrived af, and the House adjourned. The Senate was not in session on rriday. In the House the census bill was again discussed and atueuded. but no final vote was taken A motion to strike out the enacting clause was voted down by a Urge majority. The princi pal objection to tho bill seems to be that it creates too many federal office holders. A largo im.; her of bills were introduced and referred, among them one to relieve farmers who sell their own products from the necessity of tak ing out license us produce brokers, and another to make monthly sales of coin in the United States t.easury, except such us may be necessary for the pay ment of the interest on the bonds of tho United States. The Senate was not in session on Saturday. In the House, tho ways and means committee wore directed .to in quire into tho cxpediuncy of reporting a bill to repeal so much of the internal revenue law as imposes a manufacturer's tax on provision dealers, and to roliuve the provision dealers, and to relieve the provision traJe from all taxation. Mr. IngcfHoll again offered his bill to nn thorixe an additional issue of forty four millions of legal tender notes. A mo tion was made to lay tho bill on the table, but it was negatived by 88 nays to 04 yeus. It was then, by almost a similar vote, referred to the committee on banking and currency. The com mittcu on reconstruction submitted v -eral documents in relation to the ud mission of the Stale of Virginia. A bill wns introduced and referred to dis pense with spies and informers in tho internal revenue offices. The consider ation of the census bill was then re sumed, and continued until the hour of . adjournment. In the Senate on Monday, the 13th. a large number of memorials were pre ’ acoted, and a bill introduced to abolish I fho franking privilege. Tho bill to , further define and regulate the juris j diction of the courts of the United States was taken up and discussed nt length. A bill was introduced provid ing for tho farther “reconstruction” of j the State of Georgia. In the House, Mr. Butler, from the committee on reconstruction, reported i thrOe bills looking to the early admis •ion of the Slate of Virginia. There I does not seem now to be much doubt of the admission of tho Slate before the , holidays, although the House has re solved to adjourn over from the 22d of [ December to the sth of January. A i bill was passed to remove political dis f abilities from a number of Southern i citizens 1 The whole number of letters received at the dead letter office during tho year was 3,962.802 About $82,570 of i money contained in those letters was delivered to the proper persons, and • the sum deposited in the treasury un claimed $14,585.
