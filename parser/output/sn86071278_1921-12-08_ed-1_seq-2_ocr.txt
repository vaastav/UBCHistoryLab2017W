To safeguard properly the interests of the Japanese empire the ratio of 70 per cent la tonnage of capital ships is necessary, Vice Ad miral Kanji Kato, president of the Jap anese naval college and chief naval adviser to the Japanese delegation to the Washington conference, said to the Associated Press recently In an interview. Vice Admiral Kato, who ia regarded as the leading Japanese authority on naval strategy, declared that the main issue for the conference on limitation of armament was the reduction of armament burdens. "Japan accepts this issue whole heartedly," he continued, "and Is quite prepared to scrap capital ships under construction and old battleships. The naval ratio is a question of grave con cern to the security of the nations hope the United States will accept the 70 per cent for Japan which is the minimum of strength required for her security." The vice admiral remarked that the agreement to limit armaments must be accomplished by a thorough un derstanding of all those participating. "People of all countries, .he said, "must be in full agreement, otherwise even though an agreement be made it might create an unpleasant feeling and defeat Its purpose. To meet the desires of the Japanese people, as to their national defense, I believe that a 70 per cent ratio as compared with the United States and Great Britain is necessary." "The main issue inthe limitation of armament, as I have stated above, is to relieve the burdens of the nations Japan has shown her hearty accord to the idea and has agreed to the wholesale scrapping of capital ships under construction as well as old ships. This practically means that the great purpose of the conference has been attained, because it Indicates that In the future there will come about huge reduction in naval expenditure, There is another point to which would like to call your attention. When you think about the sacrifice made by the nations represented at this confer ence, it seems clear that the degree of sacrifice is very great for Japan I mean that it will be felt more keenly by us than by the United States be cause our industrial and shipbuilding power cannot be compared to that of America. "When it comes to national aspira tions and the general security of the state, I believe it best for the country concerned to decide what these nation al aspirations are and what security is needed to safeguard them. "The preamble to the American pro posals specifically says that the United States believes that the plan later, pre sented safeguards the Interests of all concerned. Let me emphasize again that in order to safeguard the inter ests of the Japanese empire 70 per cent is necessary. If the ratio of 70 per cent is accorded to Japan this does not mean the purpose of the confer ence is defeated, because, as I have pointed out before, the main purpose of the present meeting in Washington is limitation of armaments. The rela tivity of tonnage is not the 'principal issue." $50,000,000

Chicago. Fifty million dollars is trimmed from railroad payrolls by the decision of the United States rail road labor board, made public, an nouncing the new working rules for six shop craft federations. While the decision is in the main a pronounced victory for the carriers, as it greatly modifies the majority of the working rules granted the shop crafts under federal control, not all of the requests of the carriers are granted and some of the older rules sanctioned by long experience are re tained practically unchanged. The new rules go into effecf immediately. This decision is regarded by the railroad labor board as the most sig nificant work it has done to date. These rules and others about to be an nounced, had to be formulated before wage considerations could be taken up. Ben W. Hooper, vice chairman of the board, announced that the board is not in a position to take up wage matters and the controversy between the transportation heads and the big five brotherhoods, which recently near ly resulted in a widespread strike, is expected to be resumed almost imme diately. Railroads hurried to notify employ ees that a 10 per cent wage cut is contemplated. This question will be before the board formally within six weeks. - : The bulk of the modification in shop crafts working rules were made on privileges granted by the sovernment during the war. These rules have been bitterly assailed by the carriers as the cause of inefficient manage ment. Machinists were forbidden to tow:.h' anything but repairs. They coild not disconnect wiring. This had to be done by electricians. . They could no; touch pipe connection because this ws the work of sheet metal workers ouly, ;. ; Unskilled , labororsi' could not dis mantle wooden freight cars This was the work of carmen. No employee could touch an engine grate except a boilermaker. - It was this condition that caused the protests of the railroads. Under the new rules, much of this condition is done away with. . The classification of the work of electric ians, carmen, sheet metal workers, boilermakers, blacksmiths, machinists, and iron shipbuilders, iseo broadened that any employee can step in and do most any job that requires attention. Some of the rules are discontinued altogether, and the complaint of the railroads that "it takes ten men to do four men's work" is removed. Thus, a controversy of eighteen months ends with victory in the hands of railroad management. The fact that the decision was filed with no dis senting opinion of labor members of the board Is taken as acquiescence on the part of the shop craft union lead ers to changes in rules they did not hope to maintain.

There were two jurors who voted for conviction, according to Fritze. His statement follows : "I make this statement as a duty to the public. "There was a tacit understanding that the members of the jury would not make individual statements. I have learned since that a number of the jury have, however, done so, and I believe, as foreman, that it is well for those interested in the administra tion of justice that the citizens of San Francisco should have facts. "The ten members of the jury who voted on the last ballot for acquittal felt that they voted on the evidence fully considering it all. One of the two minority refused to consider the evidence from the beginning and said at the opening of the proceedings that she would cast her ballot and would not change it until hell froze over. -The other was fluctuating, sometimes casting a blan ballot sometimes vot- casting a blank ballot sometimes vot ing for the prosecution. "Considering all the evidence, " it seemed to us that the prosecution's case was an insult to the intelligence of the jury. It asked us to substitute conjecture for facts without showing what had been done, and asked us to guess what might have been done, and to guess only one way.

After a ten-day rest from fhe labors of the extra session, house and senate return to the capitol to face tasks which leaders predict will occupy prob ably seven months, dovetailing into the next congressional campaign. Nearly a dozen questions of legisla tive policy confront the members while pcore3 of lesser matters, long' pent up in the crowded calendar of business, will be pressed for action by their sponsors. President Harding plans jto give his message to the new session soon. New and added prominence promises to be given it, from the fact that probably for the first time in American history the message to congress will be de livered in the presence of members of an international conference. Any action by the conference on naval or army reduction is regarded as certain to be reflected in appro priation bills for those services, and leaders say there probably will be fre quent outbreaks of discussion on the floor concerning the arms conference and its doings. Panama canal tolls and funding of the allied debt are two other measures which appear to be linked up with the arms conference in so far as de bate is concerned. Some leaders in sisted the tolls bill would remain in committee until an ' agreement is reached by the conference. Money back without question if
