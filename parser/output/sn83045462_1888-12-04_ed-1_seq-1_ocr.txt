PROSPECTS OF THE SESSION. Appropriation Bills the Only Measures that are Sure of Passing. LITTLE CHANCE OF TARKIFF LEGISLATION?THE DISTRICT-TAX BILL MAY SQUEEZE THROUGH, ONLY TO BE VETOED?PROBABILITY OF A COM PROMISE IN ADMITTING NEW STATES. The House committee on rules will try and get together late this afternoon or to-morrow morning to consider the plans for the session. Those whose judgment is most apt to dominate are of the opinion that no great amount of work beyond the routine appropriation meas ures will be disposed of. The purpose is to pass the appropriation bills as early in the ses sion as possible, and to clear up all the neces sary routine business so that there may be no excuge for an extra session chargeable to the neglect of this Horme. THE DISTRICT APPROPRIATION BILL is now ready for consideration, as soon as the necessary printing can be done, and the com mittee is in a condition to report the other bills about as fast as the House can dispose of them. THE DIRECT-TAX BILL. It is generally conceded that the good faith of the party demands that a vote on the direct tax bill should be permitted, and there is not room for doubt that it will come up on Thurs day. the chances are, then, that very little else will be allowed to get in the way of appropria tion bills for a moment. THE SENATE TARIFF BILL. There is a probability that the Senate tariflf bill may be passed by the Senate without many changes from its present form. This will be as an indication of good faith on their part. There has been some gossip to the effect that the House would then take it tip and pass it. The Star reporter has the best authority for saving that tliere is no possible chance of the House passing the bill while it retains any thing of its present form. The chance of a tariff bill passing through Congress this winter is not worth discussing. Apparently the only measures of any general importance th it stand any chance for consideration in the House, be sides the appropriation bills, are those pro posing THE 

ADMISSION OF TERRITORIES AS STATES into the Union, and the bill to organize the territory of Oklahoma. Whether any of these will pass is a question that must be settled when the vote is taken. They are too much in doubt to make it profitable to guess at their fate. The only thing that seems certain is that the committee on rules will give these bills a chance for a hearing. Considerable opposition to the Oklahoma bill has developed, und the territory matter can be settled only bv com promise. The republicans are opposed to the admission of New Mexico, and insist upon dividing Dakota. The democrats are willing to admit Dakota as a whole only, and want New Mexico to come in with the rest. A POSSIBLE COMPROMISE. There is a chance that a compromise may be agreed upon by which New Mexico may be admitted and the south half of Dakota ad mitted as a state and the north half organized as a territory. The republicans appear willing to follow this course as to Dakota. THE BLAIR EDUCATIONAL BILL. Some Jof the southern members who favor the Blair educational bill. have hopes of secur ing its passage this winter, upon the argument that if the democrat* refuse to pass it the re Sublicans will smash the solid south with it uring the Fifty-first Congress. But they have in their way the fact that there is a most de termined minority opposed to the bill, and that if it should by any possibility pass the Presi dent would veto it The best informed demo crats believe that the bill will get no considera tion this winter. TIB PACIFIC RAILROAD FUNDING BILL in the Senate is the same as that in the House. It is thought likely that the Senate will pass it, bnt its chances are not good in the House. Nearly two-thirds of the members would prob ably vote for it if they had a chance, but the opposition is of a character to defeat its con sideration. Mr. Outhwaite, the author of the bill and chairman of the committee in charge of it, says he has not yet decided on the course be will purine. He intends to try to pass the bill if the Senate adopts It, but he has not conferred with his colleagues. It is more than likely that the direct-tax bill will pass, after some opposition. It is thought then that the President will veto it. AT THE 

CAPITOL TO-DAY. DISTRICT LAND PURCHASES. House Resolution tolnyestigate SENATE TARIFF BILL GOES OYER. Democratio Amendments Hot Yet Beady. The Senate. \ arious annual report*, including that of the Secretary of the Treasury, were presented and appropriately referred in the Senate to-day. Numerousbills were also introduced and re ferred, including one for the construction of two steel rams, to be armed with heavy rifled dynamite guns; and one for the construction of two steel cruisers, to be armed with dyna mite guns. Mr. Frye. at 12:30, moved to proceed to the consideration of TUB UNION PACIFIC SETTLEMENT BILL. Mr. Mitchell opposed the motion on the ground that he had had no time to examine the report. It was a matter that should be looked into. The Senate might go on to-day with something that Senators knew more about. THE TARIFF BILL. Mr. Teller also favored a postponement of the matter. So far as he understood the bill he was not hostile to it; but he had had no op portunity to read the report and investigate the subject. Mr. Frye said he did not, of course, wish to urge the bill on the Senate if sufficient oppor tunity had not been given for reading the report and investigating the subject; but ?he matter was a very familiar one to the Senate. It had been discussed over and over again, session after session. A select committee had been appointed early last session to consider it, and had devoted much time to the investigation. The commit tee had found that the two Pacific railroad companies (the Union and the Central) could not be connected on account of the difference in conditions and capacities of the two corpo rations. Therefore the committee had unani mously reported a bill touching the Union Pacific only. The report had been made in writing, and had beeu printed as long ago as July last. The bill (he thought) could be dis posed of in four or five morning hours. Mr. Plumb regarded the bill as being a mat ter more of private than of public interest. There was no particular reason for haste, as the debt would not mature for nine years. In the present temper of the public mind, and in view of some promises rather recently made, there was some obligation resting on the Senate to discharge public business before it took up any matter of private concern. The Senator from Maine was. ne thought, mistaken in his esti mate that the bill could be disposed of in four or five morning hours. In his (Mr. Plumb's) judgment, it would require a good deal of debate. Without saying what might eventually become of the bill, he thought it would be found to be one of rather more im portance than the Senator from Maifie seemed to think. He, therefore, hoped that if there was any spare time between now and 2 o'clock, when the tariff bill was to come up, the Senate would utilize that time by taking up the tariff bill at once. Mr. Frve said he was entirely willing to have a reassignment of the special order and to have the bill set down for next Tuesday after the morning routine business. He asked unani mous consent to have that order made. Mr. l'lunib objected. Mr. Frye said he would submit a motion to that effect at 2 o'clock to-day. THE 

TAXIFF BILL. * On motion of Mr. Allison, the tariff bill was then, at 12:30. taken up for consideration. Mr. Allison asked that the formal reading of the Senate substitute be waived, and that the substitute be read by paragraphs for amend ment. Mr. Vance objected, and the chair proceeded to read the substitute in full. After some time being consumed in this manner the presiding officer discovered that a motion to dispense with the formal reading of the bill had been made aud agreed to last session, and he read the report of that proceed ing from the Record.

KNQIt During the closing days of latft session Mr. Dingley (Me.) succeeded in having made a special order for to-day a bill /or the erection of a monument to Major-Gei/ Henry Knox, at Thomas ton. Me., but subsequently Mr. Kilgore (Tex.) entered a motion to reconsider the vote by which the order was madd. Mr. Dingley to-dav called Jp this motion and moved to lay it on the table. I MR. KJLOORB KlaES. Mr. Kilgore opposed the latter motion, de claring that there was no warrant in the Con stitution for the appropriation of #25,000 aa proposed by the bill. \ On a standing vote Mr. Dingle^s motion was carried?H6 to 42?bnt Mr. Kilgore^raised the point of "no QUORUM," this eliciting the remark of "That sounds nat ural," from the republican side. mk. dinolet's motion prevails. The yeas and nays ware ordered, and Mr. Dingley's motion prevailed. Yeas, 126; nays, 53. The House then proceeded to the considera tion of the bill, and Mr. Dingley explained that it was a Senate bill, but had been reported to the House unanimously by the oommittee on library. He briefly sketched the public service of OenT Knox, and declared that if there waa any revolutionary hero whom the people of this country might well honor, and whoee memory they might perpetuate, it waa the associate and aid and counsellor of Washington daring the eight years' straggle for independence. Mr. Kilgore agreed with anything that could be said in praise of Gen. Knox, bat he did not think that Oen. Knox's reputation was superior to the constitution of the United Statea. In hia opinion Congress exceeded its authority in using the money wrung from the people by (nation to erect monuments in Maine or Ten* r Colorado. Mr. Bland (Mo.) commented on the fact that the people of Maine had not gone down into their own pockets and built a monument to one of the state's patriots who had died nearly ninety years ago. MR. breckinridge, OF KXTTCKT. Mr. Breckinridge (Ky.) said that there were upon the calendar twelve bills for the erection of monuments throughout the country, the appropriations contained therein aggregating ?276,000. It seemed to him that the govern ment was going into the monument business rather at wholesale. Mr. McMillin (Tenn.), while expressing his reverence for the memory of the revolutionary heroes, entered his protest against the genera^ government going into the states for the pjtr purpose of erecting monuments. IN THE CITT or washington. Mr. Mansur (Mo.) favored the erection of ! the monument in the city of Washington in stead of at Thomas ton, Me. Mr. Spinola (N. Y.), while opposed to ex travagant public expenditures, felt it his duty to support a measure which would transmit to coming generations the memory of one of I those men who underwent hardship and suffer I ing in order that the republic might be cre ated. again HO QUOKUX. On the demand for the previous question the | vote stood?yeas, 111; nays, 46?no quorum, ! and a call of the House was ordered and 205 members responded to their names. Capitol Talk About the Message. DEMOCRATS SAT IT IB A GOOD 'CN?REPUBLIC ANB BAT: "LIT HIM 0OOLD." The President's message has provoked but little comment at the capitoL The republicans are inclined, as they say, '-to let him scold," since they have got the victory. They all say about the same thing, dismissing it with a few words. Democrats, without an exception speak in praise of it, and the enthusiastic tariff re formers are especially pleased at the manly way in which he stands by the principles they advocate. They speak of the message as the best ot Mr. Cleveland's state papers. The fact that nothing is expected to come of the mes sage under present conditions discourages its extended discussion. Made Out of Whole Cloth. MR. 

ALLISON SATS HZ HAS NOT BEEN OFFERED THE SECRETARYSHIP OF THE TREASURY. Senator Allison's attention was called by an Associated Press reporter to a telegram from Lima, Ohio, quoting Railroad Commissioner ! Campbell, of Iowa, as authority for the state ment that Mr. Allison had been offered the Secretaryship of the Treasury by President elect Harrison. Said Mr. Allison: "I know Mr. Campbell very well. He is an excellent gentleman. I have not seen him since the election, nor communicated with him by letter, and he has not written to me. I have not been offered the Secretaryship of the Treasury nor have I accepted it. I should say that that paragraph is pretty nearly made out of whole cloth." Capitol Topics.

"I haven't made up my mind vet and neither has Gen. Harrison. Til tell Wi what I do know, though, and that is that thetsjiuing President has not come to any con clubiotK as to any one of his cabinet officers.

The escape was a very narrow one. ENGLISH OPINION. The "Standard" Severe on the Presi dent's Reference to Sackvllle. London.

We did not expect to find him repeating his origi nal error to show that he was not ashamed of himself." After quoting the references to the Sackville matter in the message the Standard proceeds in a similar strain and ruin through sentence after > sentence of solemn froth. "Englishmen." it says, "can afford to smile at such puerile non sense, and even Americans will not pretend to take it in good earnest Doubtless Lord Sack ville was technically wrong, but Ministers Low ell and Phelps committed themselves in the same w^y, though not in the same degree, scores of times in their addresses to English men, which we treated with much edification and not the smallest trace of resentment."
