Washington, Dec, C; President Mc kinley's message to congress is an , exhaustive? s.tate, paper, cpntalnlng about 18,00P words, each subject being tjreateil vyith carefully collated detail. The ensuing abstract gives the salient features of the message, while the most Important portions of the mes sage ate given verbatim: To the Senate anil. House ot Representa tives: At the outgo!)!); of the old unit the incoming ot the "i'v century you be .gju the lust session of the Flftj'-slx.h con gress with -evidences on every hiiuil of Individual anil national piospcrlty and proof of growing strength and In creasing, potter for tint good ot lepub llcan institutions. Your eouutrymen vl;i Join with you In felicitation that Ameri can liberty lb more llrmly established lh.ui ever before, und that love for It and the determination to preserve it me more un. versul than at any former period of our history. The republic was never so strong, be. cause never so strongly entrenched in the hearts of the people us now. The constl- tutldn, with few amendments, exists as It left the bauds of Its authors. The addi tions which have been made to It procmlni larger freedom and more extended citizen ship. Popular government has demonstrated li. its 1124 years of trial here its stability and its etlicleuey as the best Instrument of national development and the best safe guard to human rights. Progress- oft a Century. When the Sixth congress assembled in November,' 1S00, the population of the Uulted States was 5,308,483,. It Is now 7U,304,7l. Then we had 10 states. Now, -we have 4fj, Then our territory consisted ,of 0(Kf,050 square miles. It is now 3,840,- 51)5 square tulles. Education, religion and morality have kept pace with our advunce- meut in other directions and while extend- .lug Its power the goeynment has adhered to Its foundation principles and abated , none of them In dealing with our peoples and possessions, A nation so preserved and blessed gives reverent thanks to God and Invokes Ills guidance and the eon.lu ounce of his care un , favor. In our foreign Intercourse the dominant question has been the treatment of the Chinese problem. Apart fiom this our re lations with the powers have been happy. The Chi ti est; Question. ' The recent troubles In China spring from the untl-foreign agitation which for the past three years has gained strength In the northern provinces. Their origin lies deep in the character of the Chinese races, und In the traditions of their government. The Talplng rebellion and tho opening of Chinese ports to foreign trade and settle ment disturbs alike tho homogeneity und tbt seclusion of, China. Meanwhile foreign activity made Itself felt In all quarters, not alone on the coast, but along the great river arteries and In tho remoter districts, carrying new Ideas - and Introducing, ue,w associations among a primitive people, which hud pursued for centuries u national iwllcy of Isolation. For several years before the present trou- . bh"? ll the resources of foreign diplomacy, tyucked by moral, demonstrations of the physical forcu of fleets and arms have been needed to sectye due respect of treaty rights of foreigners to obtain satisfaction from responsible authorities for the spor adic out rages upon the persons and property of unoffending sojourners, which from tltne to. time occurred ut widely separated points In the northern provinces, as In the cuse of the' outbreaks In Sze-Chnun and Shun Tung, Posting of nntl-forelgn placards be came n dully occurrence, which the repeat ed reprobation of the Imperial power failed, to check or punish. These Inflammatory' appeals to the Ignorance and superstition of tho masses, mciida'dous and absurd In 1.1) el r accusations and deeply hostile In their spirit, could not but woik cumulative harm, They alined at no purtlculur class of foreigners; they were Impartial in at tacking everything foreign, An outbreak lit Shun Tung, in which Ger man missionaries weie slain was the too uuturul result of these malevolent teach lugs. Tho posting of seditions placards, exhorting to the utter destruction of for eigners and of every foreign thing, contin ued, unrebnked. Hostile demonstration toward the stranger gained strength by ' organization. , The1 sect, commonly styled the Itoxcrs, developed -greatly In tho provinces north -of the. Yang-tse, nipl with the collusion of many notable otlleluls, lpeludlng some In tho' Immediate councils of the throne Itself,, became ulunilngly aggressive. No f A-i.tiiiii.l lift, Stllt.jt.1fl tf i l.i rwn, .-.., l' treaty 'norts, was safe. No forelgu Intercut was secured fiom spoliation. The Increasing: gravity of the conditions 'in China and I he Imminence of peril to our own diversified Intercuts In the empire, ns wrll as to those of nil the other treaty gpverniiejit,s, were soon, appreciated by this government, causing It profound so licitude. The United States from the earli est of foreign Intercourse with China had fallowed, a policy of, peace, omitting no oc casions to testify good' will, to further the extensions of lawful trade, to respect the sovereignty of. Its government, and td In sure by all legitimate nwl kindly but earn est menus the fullest measure of protec tion for the lives and, property of. our law- f abiding citron and for the exercise of their beneficent callings among the Chinese people. The Ope.it Door. Here follows a resume, of negotiation 'wltri the powers occupying spheres of In fluence In China, which resulted In the "opendoor" agreement announced March 30, 1000, which, It'was hoped, would nlluy ' the troubled state of affairs In China, and was for owed by withdrawing the jaarlne guard and a resort to diplomatic discourse. The message continues: The UhlufcKe government proved, how ever, unable to check the rising strength of the Itoxcrs and appeared to be a piey to Internal dlsseutlous. In the unequal contest the nntl-forelgn Influences soon gained the ascendency under the leader ship of Prince Tuun. Organized utniles of lloxers, with which the Imperial forces uflllluted, held the country between Peking and the coast, penetrated Into Mumhuna up to the Russian border, und thiough their emissaries threatened u like ilslug thioughout northern China. Attacks upon fotelgners, destruction of their property tnd slaughter of native converts were re ported from all sides. The Tsung 1,1 Va Juan, already permeated with hostile sym pathies, could, make no. effective response to the oppeuls of the legations. At this critical Juncture, In the early spiing of the year, a proposal was made by tip." other powers that a combined fleet should be as sembled In Chinese uters as a moral dem onstration, under cover of which to ex.iyt of the Chinese government respect for for eign treaty rights and the suppression of the lloxers. The United States, while not participating In the Joint demonstration, promptly sent fiom the Philippines all the ships that could be spared from service on the Chinese coast. A small force of marines was lauded ut Taku and sent to Peking for the protection of the Ameilcan legation. Other powers took similar action until some -100 men were assembled lu the capltul-us legation guards. Still the peril Increased. The legations reported the development of the seditious movement in Peking und the need of In creasd provision for defense against It. While preparations were in progress for n larger expedition, to strengthen the lega tion guards and keep tl" railroad open, an attempt of the forelgusblps to make a landing at Taku was met by tire fiom the1 Chinese forts. The forts were there upon shelled by the foreign vessels, the American admiral taking no part lu the attack, on the ground thut we weie not at war with China, and thut u hostile dem onstration might consolidate the nntl-forelgn element! nnd strengthen the Huxers to oppose the relieving column. Two days later tho Taku forts were captured, after a sanguinary conflict, Severence of com munication with Peking followed, und a combined force of additional guards, which was advancing to Peking by the l'el Ho, was. cheeked at Lung Kung. The Uolatton of the legations was complete. Aftt;r recltjng the thrilling history of the relief of the besieged legations, the assas sination of Huron Von Ketteler, the Her man minister, June 20, the campaign of the allied forces from Tien Tsln to Peking nnd the rescue, Aug, 14, In which the con duct of the Uulted States, soldiers and sailors Is highly commended, the flight of the Imperial family, the message says the announced policy of tho United States us not being nt war with China was scrupu lously carried out. Then follows n re hearsal of the negotiations for peace along the lines of the Itusslan and French piopo- sltlons. The message says: The disposition of the emperor's government to admit lia bility for wrongs done to foreign govern ments and their nationals, und to act upon such addlounl designation of guilty per sons ns the foreign ministers at Peking may bo in a position to make, gives hope of a complete settlement of all questions Involved, assuring foreign rights ot resi dence, and intercourse on terms of equality for all the world. I reguid us one of the essential factors of a duruble adjustment the seeuieinent of adequate guarantees for liberty of faith, since Insecurity of those natives who may embrace alien creeds Is scarcely less effec tual assault upon the rights of foreign worship nnd teaching thnu would be the direct invasion thereof. The mntter of Indemnity for our wronged citizens Is n question of grave concern. Measured in money alone, n suillclcnt rep aration may prove to be beyond the ability of China tq meet. All the powers concur in emphatic disclaimers of any purpose of aggrandizement through the dismember ment of the empire, I um disposed to think that due compensation may be made in part by Increased guarantees of secur ity for foreign rights and Immunities, and, most important of all, by the opening, of China to the equal commerce of all the worldi These views have been and v'lll be earnestly advocated by our representa tives. Tho government of Russia 1ms put for ward a suggestion, that In the event of protracted divergencies ot views In regard to indemnities the matter may be rele gated to tho court of arbitration at The Hague. I favorably Incline to this, bellev; Irig that high tribunal could, not full to rench a solution no less, conducive to tho stability and enlarged prosperity of China Itself than immediately beneficial to the po,wers. Various Foreign Affairs. Under tills head nre epltoiulzed tlic rati ftcaUon of an. cxtradltlou treaty with Ar gentine, Jt.no 2; protest against arrest Of. naturalized citizens by the Austr6-IIuu-garlan government; the International con vention to regulate the liquor trade hi Africa, citing that compliance is withheld, pending rutUlcatlon by tho eenatc, and favoring Its extension by International agreement to the restriction of tho liquor tratllc among all uncivilized peoples, espe cially In the western Pacific; und n resume of relations with South American govern ments', Purls Kjtpos'tloo," The message dwells at length upon tho Paris exposition, expressing gratification over the exhibits of this country as being the largest foreign display and receiving the greatest number of awards distributed among 'the exhibiting nations. Apart from the exposition several occa sions for showing International good will occurred. The Inauguration In Paris of the Lafayette monument, presented by the school children of the United States," and the designing of a commemorative coin by our mint and. the. presentation of the tlrst piece stiuck to the president of the re public, miiiked by appropriate ceremonies, and the Fourth of Judy, was esiieciallv observed lu the French capital. flood Will With (Jernini.y. Good will prevails In our relations wjth Ihe Uerman empire. Air amlcuble adjourn ment of the long pending question of ad mission of our life Insurance companies to do business In Prussia has been reached. One of the principal companies has also been le.idmltted, and the way Is opened for the others to share the privileges. The settlement of the Sumoan problem, to which I adverted lu my last message, has accomplished good tesults. Peace and content piewill in the Islands, especially In T-Jtllu, where a convenient administra tion that has won the conildeuce and es teem of the kindly disposed natives has been organized under the direction of the comi miner of the United States naval r.fr tlon at Pago Pago. An Imperial meat Inspection law has been cno'-ted, fpr Germany. Wlrile It may simplify the Inspections, It prohibits cer tain pioducts heretofore admitted. There Is still great uiucrtulnty as to whether our well-tiU'h extinguished German trade In meat pioducts can revive under Its new burdens. Much will depend upon regula tions not yet piomulgated, which we con fidently hope will he fiee from the dis criminations which attend the enforcement of the old statutes. The remaining link In the new lines of direct telegraphic communication between the United States and the German empire has recently been completed, affording a gratifying occasion for exchange of friend ly congruttOullous with the Gcrmuu em peicr. . Friendly With Great Britain. Our friendly relations with Great Urltaln continue. The war In South Africa Intro duced llriiiuillUit questions. A condition unusual la international wars was pre sented In thut while one belligerent hud control of the. seas, the other had no ports, thlpplng or direct trade, but was only uc feasible thiough the territory of a neutral. Vexatious questions arose through Gieat IJritaln's action In respect to neutral ear roes, not lontrabund In their own u.ituie, shipped to Portuguese South Africa, cm the score of probable or suspected ulti mate destination to the lloer siates. Such consignments In Iiililsh sWps, by which nhvie direct trade Is kept up be tween our ports and Southern Africa, weie seized In application of a law prohibiting Hrltlsh vessels from trading with the ene my without legstrd to any contraband char acter of the goods, while cargoes shipped lo Dclago.t bay lu neutral bottoms were arrested on the ground of alleged destina tion to enemy's country. Appropriate rep lesentntlons on, our part resulted In the Urltlsh government ngreelng to purchase outright all such goods shown to be ac tual property of American citizens, thus closing the Incident to the satisfaction of the Immediately Interested parties, al though unfortunately without n bioud set tlement of the question of a neutral's right to send goods not contraband per se to u neutral port adjacent to a lielllgernnt urea. The work of marking certain piovlslonal boundnry points, for convenience of ad ministration, around the hejd of Lynn cunal, In accordance with the temporary arrangement of October, 1S0!, 'was com pleted by a Joint survey In July last. The modus tlreiidi has so far woiked without friction, and the dominion government has provided rules and regulations for seeming to our citizens the benefit of the recipro cal stipulation that the citizens or subjects of either power found by that air.iiigeuient within the temporary Jurisdiction of the other shall suffer no diminution of the rights ami privileges they have hitherto enjoyed, Hut, however necessary such an expedient may have been to title over the grave emergencies of the situation. It Is at best but an unsatisfactory makeshift, which should not he suffered to delay the speedy and complete establishment of tne fiontler Hue to which we are entitled un der the Kiisso-Auieilcau treaty for the ces sion of Alu.dai. Jn this relation I may refer to the need of definitely marking the Alaskan lourulnry where It follows the one bundled and forty-first met Minn. A convention to that end has been before the senate for some two years, but as no action has been taken I contemplate negotiating a new conven tion for Joint determination of the meridian by telegraphic observations. These. It Is believed, will give more unquestionable re sults, as the Sidereal methods heretofore Independently followed, which, as Is known, proved discrepant at several points on the line, although not varying ut any place more than 700 feet, Italy. Respectful reference Is mndo jo the ns sasslnailon Of King Humbert. heuewed reeonimendntlon is mude that congress should confer on federal courts Jurisdiction in lnternutlouul cuses, us In the case of the five ItulfuUs lynched at Talluhih, ami the passage of pending bills to that end Is urged. Incidentally, on the subject of lynching, the president quotes and reiter ates his utterances on the subject lu hid Inaugural nddress. ltelatlons with Jupun and Mexico are dis cussed, showing satisfactory conditions. Tito Jlttguo Convention. It Is wlfb satisfaction that I am able to announce the forniul nntltlcatlomi at The Hague, Sept. 4, of the deposit of rutlilca- , tlons, of the convention for the pacific set tlement or tne international disputes by 111 powers, namely, the United State, Austria, Itelglum, Denmark, Hnglund, France, Germany, Italy, Persia, Portugal, Koumaniu, Itussla, Slam, Spain, Sweden and Norway and the Netherlands. Japan also has since ratified the convention. Tho administrative council of the per manent court of arbitration has been or- . ganlzed, and has adopted rules of order nnd a constitution for the international arbitration bureau, In accordance with Article 

XXIII, providing for each slgnn. ' tory power In questions of International rliiw as arbitrators, I have appointed, as members of this court, llou, llcnjaudn Harrison of Indiana, ex-prertuetit; lion. Melville W. Fuller of Illinois, chief Jus tice of the United States; Hon. J.W.Griggs of New Jersey, attorney general of the United Stntcs. and Hon. George Gray of I Delaware, Judge of the circuit court of the ! United States. ' XUutrngUHii Canal. ! The all Important matter of an Inter oceanic canal has assumed a new phase. Adhering to Its refusal to reopen the ques tion of the forfeit in e of the contract of Ihe Maritime Canal company, which was ter minated for alleged nonexecuilon lu Octo ber, lb'.Ht, the government of Nicaragua has since supplemented that action by de claring the so-styled Uyre-Craiuln option void for nonpayment of the stipulated ad vance. Piotests In ictiiru to these acts have been filed lu the state department and me under consideration. Deeming It self lell-m-d from existing engagements, the Nlcaruguuu government shows a dis position to deal freely with the canal quts lion, either In the way of negotiations with the United States or by taking meas ures to promote the waterway. 0ertutes for a convention to examine the bulldlug of the canal under the aus pices of the United States aie under con sideration, in the meantime the lews of congiess upon the Milder. In the light of the report of the commission appointed to examine the comparative nieiits of the various truiislsthmlun ship canal projects, may be awaited. 1 commend to the eaily attention of the senate the convention with Great Hiituln to facilitate the t (instruction of such a cunal and, to remote any objection which might arise out of the convention com monly called the Claytoii-IIulwer treaty. Attention Is given the recent settlement of the long standing contention with Por tugal by the payment of the Delagoa bay awuid. Itnsslu Is thanked for aid lu Si beria to American mlsslomules fleeing from Manchuria. The iceeiit purchase for ?10D, 000 of two Islands In the Philippine group not Included lu the traty of pitce with Spain will be submitted to the senate for ratification. The Sumoan claims tire pend ing arbitration. Reciprocity treaties with Portugal, Italy and tlermany have been piotiulmed. ISeelprpclty. The policy of leclpioclty so manifestly rests upon the principles of International equity and has been so tepeatedly ap proved by the people of the United States, that there ought to he no hesitation lu either branch of the longress lu giving to It full effect. This government desires to preserve the most Just and amicable commercial rela tions with all foreign commies, uumoted by the Industrial rivalries necessarily de veloped in the expansion of International trade. It Is believed that the foreign gov ernments generally entertain the same pur pose, although lu some Instances theie are clamorous demands upon them for legis lation specifically hostile to American In terests. Should these demands prevail 1 shall coi.inuulcute with the congress wltb the view of advising sunn legislation ns may be necessary to meet the emergency. The presldeut expresses giatlflcutlon over the progress being made for the Pau-Ainer-lean exiwsltton at ilufl.ilo next jeur. The work of the- bureau of American lepubllcs Is approve!. The consular service Is ou mended for Its Wticlency. KIs. al AlT.ilrs. It Is gratifying to be nble to stnte that the surplus revvfiues for the fiscal .tear ended June 30, IP00. were $TU,!J2T,(KiU.lii. For the six preceding years We had" only ietlclts", the aggregate of which from lbW to lgl)(, Inclusive, amounted to lf2S3,0,. 41U.14. The receipts for the year from all sources, exclusive of postal revenues, ag gregated $307,'.M0,!51.8!l, and expelidituus for all purposes except for the adminis tration of the postul department, aggre gated ?487,718,7H1.71.

Tho receipts fiom Internal revenue were M)5,:n7,tUU,70, an Increase of f.'J.hVO, 705.25 over ISiO. The receipts from mis cellaneous sources were $3.S,745,05U.!I7, as against .1(i,:!!M,l7G.9'J for the previous year. It Is gratifying also to note that dining the year a considerable i eduction Is shown In the expenditures of the got eminent. The war department expenditures for the fiscal year

The details of the sink Ing fund are set forth In the report of the secretary of the treasury, to which 1 In vite attention. The secretary of the treas ury estimates thut the receipts of the coun try for the Uscal year will nggregate $5C0, 000,000 and the expenditures 300,000,000, leaving (in excess of revenues over expend Itures of $iid,000,000. The condition of the treasury Is one of undoubted strength. It will be the duty, ns I am sure It trill be the disposition of congress to protlde whatever further legislation is needed to Insure the continued purity under all con ditions between our two forms of metallic money, silver nud gold. Our surplus revenues have permitted the secretary of tho treasury since the elns ,of the llseal year to call in the funded loan or jmii couiiiiueu at - per cent, in the cum of $23,J4,ooO, To nnd Including Nov. :;o, fU3,458.UKl of theie bonds have been paid, This sum, together with the amount which may accrue from further redemptions under the call, will be ap plied to the sinking fund. The law of Mnrch 1,4, 1000, provides for refunding into 2 percent 30- year bonds, payable, principal and Interest, In gold' coin of the present standard value, that portion of the public debt represented by the 3 per cent bonds of 1U08, the 4 per cents of 1007, uhd the 5 per cents of 1004, of which thero was outstanding, nt the date ot said law $ai9,l-tlMW. The holders of the old" bonds presented thciu for ex change between ,Mdi-cli 14 and Nov. !!0 to the amount of f'JO-l,p43,7r.0, The net sav ing to the government on these transac tions aggregates if 0.100,10(1. Auothercffect of the operation, as stated Is to reduce tlie cli.ir.te JUH l ill- milium iutvui m duced by the sum of more than N.'.OO .W . nml for the Ut months ending Aug. 1. 11108. by about .$1,000.1)1)0.

The beneficial effect if the financial net of WOO, so fur us It relates to the moilltl catlon of the national banking act. Is al ready appaient. The provision for the lu corpoiatiiiii of national banks with a capi tal of not less than .2.'i.0O0, In places nut exceeding H.noo Inhabitants, has resulted In the 'extension of hanking facilities to many small communities hltheito unable to provide themselves with banking Insti tutions under the national system. There were organized fiom the enactment of the law up to nml Including Nov. 30, 3ti!l na tional banks.of which L'dd were with capital less than $50,000, and 103 with capital ot, $50,000 or more. It Is worthy of mention that the greater number of banks being organized under the new law are In spetlons whole the need of banking facilities has been most pronounced. Tea, Oklahoma. Indian Ter ritory ami western sections of the country have availed themselves largely of the pilv lieges under the new law. The Increase In circulating notes from March 14 to Nov. 30 Is $77.OJO(r.70. The patty In power Is commit led to such legislation' as will better make the cur rency lesponslve to the varying needs of business ut all seasons ami In all sections. Koreljrn Trade. Our foreign trade shows a remarkable record of commercial and Industrial pn gress. The total of Imports and exports for the llrst time In the history of the country exceeded $'J.O00,0oo.niH). The ex ports are gieater than they have ever been before, the total for the flseal .tear l!.s being ?l,:SM,4h3,0S'J, an luciease oter 1M.M of $107,450,780, mi Incie.ise oter 1s'.S of $1(13,000,7.''-', over 1S07 of S343,4tl!,.V'(i, iiliti greater than 1MK1 by $511,870,144. The growth of lumiufactutes lu the Unit ed States Is evident cd by the fact that ex ports of manufactured products largely ex ceed those of any previous year, tlntr value for 1000 being $433.S51.75(i. against $33'.i,. 30J.140 In lMi'.i. an Increase of US per cent. Agtlciiltural products were :ilo expoiteil during 1000 In greater olunie than In 1S!). tho total for the year being $t35,MS,l-,S, against $7S4.77(i,14,J In 1MI0. The Imports for the year amounted to $8U1,941,1S4, an Increase over INK! of $15'. 702,005. This Increase Is largely lu ma terial for Sail Fianclsco, and Is icspoiisc to the rapid development of manufactur ing In the United States. While theie was Imported for use !u the manufactures for 1000 material to the value of $7H,7iiS.U7'J In excess of IS'.'O. It is le.issurlng to ob serve that theie Is a tendency towuitl de crease In the importation of articles manu factured n'ady for consumption, which In 11)00 rorineil i.i.i per cem oi me lowu im ports, against 15.54 in 1MI0, and 21,00 In IsOl). Heduce War Kevenue. I recommend that the congress at Its present session reduce the Internal lev enue taxes Imposed to meet the expeu of the war with Spain In the sum of $:;o, 000,000. This reduction should be seemed by the remission of those tuxes which ex perience has shown to be the most bur densome to the Industries of the people. I specially urge that there he included lu whatever reduction Is made the legacy tax. bequests for public uses of a literary, edu cutlouul or charitable character. Merchant .Ma line. American vessels during the past three years have curried about 9 per, cent of out exports and Imports. Foreign ships should carry the least, uot the greatest, part of American trade. The remarkable growth of our steel litiustiles, the progress of shipbuilding tor th4 domestic trade, nud our steadily maintained expenditures for the navy hate created an opportunity, to place the United States In the first rank nf commercial maritime powers. I um satisfied the judgment of the coun try favors the policy of aid to our mer chant murine, which will broaden our com meice und markets and up-bulld our sea currying capacity for the products of agri culture and inuiiiitucttiic, which, with the lucreuse of our navy, mean more work and wages to our countrymen, as well as a cafe guuid to Aiueiicuu lutcibsU lu every part of the world. The Tru ts. fa my last annual messnge to the con gress I called attention to the necessity for early action to remedy such evils as might be found to exist In connection with combiuutlonsi of capital organized Into trusts, und again Invite attention to my discussion of the subject at that time. The whole question Is so Important and far-reaching that I am sure no part of it will be lightly considered, but every phase of It will have the studlod deliberation of the congress, resulting In wise and JudU, clous action. Restraint upon such combinations as nro lnJurlou$ and which are within foderal Jurisdiction should bo promptly applied by the congress. r The Philippines: In my last annual, message I dwelt at ome length upon the condition of affair's In tho Philippines.
