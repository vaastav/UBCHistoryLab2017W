The experiment of sending a number of Indian Children, of both sexes, to the Hampton Normal ami Agricultural Institute, in Virginia, to receive uuelonieniarv Kn*. h education and practical In struction in fanning and other nselnt industries, has led to results to promising, that it was thought expedient to turn over ihe cavalry barracks at Carlisle, in iVnusvlvania, to the interior depart ment for Iho e.-iaulishmcnt of an Indian school on a larger scale. Tho school has now one hun dred ami fifty .eight pupils, selected from various tribes, and is in full operation. Arrangements arc also made fur the education of a number of Indian hoys uud girls belonging to tribes on Ihe Pacific slope, in a similar manner, at Forest (irove, in Oregon, These institutions will com mend themselves to the liberality of congress, and to tho pUilautlnoptc munificence ol the American people.
