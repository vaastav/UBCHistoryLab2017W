Not even the Ander son McColmick ?lection law ?an the Democratic party from the consequences of such niismauage ment. Hut we hope, and firmly be? lieve, Hi.it the ie'xirt Is a groundless .ion, and that our resources ?ire nut only eqial to all present demands, but that the next assess uieiif, now near at hauil, will in our revenues beyond all probable need. ? Index Appeal. Ni.v let every paper In the state r?veil e'.ite I his sentiment, and the ?lebt question will be quickly ad? justed. 11. Jit'./ trouble about this debt mutter has arisen out of a cross between the SnorlKwrne.*! and the Ididocracy of the Press, and the Hostings. Gentlemen let us elimi? nate tin? question now and forever. .Senator Vance is in hot pursuit of the eivll service law. So is Farewell of Illinois. < '.ingress organized Monday and our Virginia General Assembly on Wednesday. Too early for pro en dings. The President message on the 1 Muir Educational I?ill" i* worth the while of each and everj man and woman to read it. lhe railroad men will burrah themselves as hoarse as the whistle 00 a H. ?ti O. passenger train when they road his recommendation in their behalf. I he Piesiilent'H suggestions and recomonilatioiis iu relation to the ml Intiks will be approve?! by every taxpayer, an I opposed only by the stockholder. We omit several of the most able bodied editorials we have read since Horace Greely laid down the pen for the Presidency and took u, the grave, if we?losay it ourselves. Probably nobody etse will say it for us when some, or all, of them appear. Gentlemen, take time to think ! Tins Administration has been but nine months in its incumbency. We shall certainly take weeks and months in consenting its first tries i?'??! ling as bis cotemporaries shall p?ss upon its meaning and . and he himself shall further explain, as lie must. Tin if .ne several things in the President's message to commend themselves to the reader and think? er without regard to party. Next week we shall publish the message of (.overnor Fitz Lee, which ?'..s sent in yeaterday. Our paper is homemade. We i?, picture books. We must take things as thev come. liead the message through and through. Tuen begin to think. What we give von was the bust obtainable on iy evening, and is the gistot the document. We shall comment on it when we have read and studied it. Mr. Pr?sidant ' Heware of Ex tradition Treaties ! >Ve have com marcial relations witn sucb (Joun tins as our domestic industries would suggest as wholesome, un? less, is vi i any, China. Be ware, Mr. Harrison, beware! Do not, we pritl.ee, tease the American citizen with another extradition Treaty, foisembef the Winslow l"> member last Session ! The Republican Press of the Country endorses the President's Messae?-. A number of Independ? ent papers do likewise. Rut his recommend .nions in regard to Civil Bigbteand National Elections will bring the wrath of the Democ? racy of the Nation on bis head. N e have no*, space for our own comment on these. Covernor I/ee's Message will settle the Debt question. It will now be understood that there are to Is- no more Commissions, and no more ??shenanegan.'' What a pity General M abone could not take the start in bis Norfolk plat? form and Abingdon esaay. lie bad approved the Kiddlaberger Illll for ten years. Comedown, Mr. bond conspira? tors! Come down, Judge Itond ! Throe hundred and sixty thousand unite?! voters, determined not to pay West Virginia's share of the debt, will go straight over tbe breastworks. General Mahouel will be badly left at Abingdon. !
