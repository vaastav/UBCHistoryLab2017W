ROOSEVEIT10 IDE LAWMAKERS President Says Financial Stand ing of Nation is Excellent —Taxes Reduced. Repeats Recommendations Re garding Corporations Doaag Interstate Business. During the period from July 1, 1901, to Sept. 30, the balance between 1 The railroads of the country should be put completely under the interstate commerce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. Th" jHiwer of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and con trol over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways has been one of the most valuable features in recent legislation. Power to make combinations and traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission of the com mission being first gained and the com bination or agreement being published in all its details. In the interest of the public the representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their duty by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is done the railroads. The shareholders, the em ployes and the shippers all have inter ests that must be guarded. It Is to the interest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, and that there should be no Improper issuance of securities. There must be no defrauding of investors, oppression of farmers and business men who ship freight, or callous dis regard of the rights and needs of em ployes. Rates must be made as low as Is compatible with giving proper re turns to the shareholders but they must not, for instance, be reduced in such.a fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of employes or the aboli tion of the proper and legitimate profits* of honest shareholders. As fir as possible he hopes to see a frank recognition of the advantages eonferred by machinery, organliati"n *nd division of labor, accompanied by an effort to brinjr about a larger share in the ownership by wage-worker of railway, rnlll and factory. The regulation of the national high ways must be such that they shall serve all people with equal justice. Corporate finances must be supervised so as to inake It far safer than .*t present for thw man of small means to invest his money in stocks. There must be prohibition of child labor sto-. k watering should be prohibited, and stock gambling so far as possible discouraged. There should be a pro gressive inheritance tax on large frr» tunes. Industrial education should ba encouraged. Aa far ar possible v.* should lighten the burden of taxation on the small man. We should put a premium on thrift, hard work and business energy. It is eminently right that the nation should fix the terms upon which the great fortunes are in herited. They rarely do good and they often do harm to those who in herit them in their entirety. The The following Is a synopsis of the president's message to congress: The financial standing of the nation above is the merest sketch, hardly even at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's Interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system is imperfect, and it is earnestly to be hop that the cur rency commission will be able to pro pose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. sketch in outline, of the reforms for which we should work. But there is one matter with which congress should deal at this session. There should no longer be any paltering with the ques tion of taking care of the wage-work ers who. under our present industrial system, become killed, crippled or worn out as part of the regular incidents of a given business. The majority of wage-workers must have their rights secured for them bv state action but the net ordinary receipts and the net Jhe national government should legis ordinary expenses of the government showed a surplus of nearly $100,000,000 of receipts over expenditures, a reduo tion of the Interest In aring deht by i *90,000,000, in spite of the extraordi- nary expense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. Then- have been no new taxes on the contrary, some taxes have been taken off there has been a reduction of taxation, As regards the great corporations engaged in interstate business, and es pecially the railroads, I can only re peat what I have al- Corporations ready again and at'ain said in my messages to congress. I believe that under the Interstate clause of the con stitution the United States has com plete and paramount right to control all agencies of Interstate commerce, and 1 believe that the national govern ment alone can exercise this right with wisdom and effectiveness, so as both to secure justice from, and to do jus tice to, the great corporations which are the most important factors in mod ern business. I believe that it Is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all combinations as is done by the Sher man anti-trust law. because such a law can be enforced only imperf. ctly and unequally, and its enforcement works almost as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an unwise effort to prohibit all com binations. there shall be substituted a law which shall exprtssly pc-rmit com binations which are in the interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to siime agency of the national government full power of control and supervision over them. One of the chief features of this control should be late iu thoroughgoing and far-reach ing fashion not only for all employes of the national government, but for all persons engaged in interstate com merce. The object sought for could be achieved to a measurable degree, as far as those killed or crippled are con cerned. by proper employers' liability laws. As far as concerns those who have been worn out. definite steps toward providing old-age pensions nave been taken in many of our pri vate industries. To strengthen these practical measures should be our im mediate duty. When a workman is •injured what he needs is not an ex pensive and doubtful lawsuit, but the certainty of relief through immediate administrative action. The law passed at the last session of crngress granting compensation to cer tain clas es of employes of the gov ernment should be extended to include all employes of the government and should be made more liberal in its terms. Congress should without further delay pass a model employers' liability law :'or the district of Columbia. The president recommends that the principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as practicable be extended to the entire work being car ried on by the 'government. The president urges upon congress the duly of increasing the salaries now given our judges. Begiryiing with the supreme court, he says, the judges should have their salaries doubled. Court*. It is earnestly to be desired that some method should be devised for doing away with the long delays which now obtain in the administration of justice, and which operate with pe culiar severity against persons of securing entire publicity in all matters small means, and favor only the very criminals whom it is most desirable to punish. These long delays iri the final decisions of cases make in the aggregate a crying evil and a remedy should be devised. which the public has a right to know, and furthermore, th- power, not by judicial, but by executive action, to pre vent or put a stop to every form of Improper favoritism or other wrong doing. Our judicial system is sound and ef fective at core, and it remains, and must be maintained, as the safeguard of those principles of liberty and justice which stand at the foundation cf American institutions. The presi dent thinks there is ground for the belief that substantial injustice is often suffered by employes in conse quence of the custom of the courts is suing temporary injunctions without notice to them, and punishing for con tempt of court in instances where, as a matter of fact, they have no knowledge of any proceedings. There is a widespread feeling that this sys tem often works great injustice to wageworkers when their efforts to better their working condition result in industrial disputes. A temporary injunction procured ex parte may as a matter of fact have all the effect of a permanent injunction in causing disaster to the wageworker's side in such a dispute. Organized labor is chafing under tlv unjust restraint which comes from repeated resort to this plan of procedure. Its discontent has been unwisely expressed, and often improperly expressed, but there is a sound basis for it, and the order ly and law-abiding people of a com munity would be in a far stronger position for upholding the courts if the undoubtedly existing abuses could be provided against. Such proposals as advocated by some of the extreme labor leaders contain the vital error of being class legislation of the most offensive kind, and even if enacted into law would rightly be declared unconstitutional. The power of Injunction is a great equitable remedy, which should on no account be destroyed. But safeguards should be erected against its abuse Provision should be made that no in junction or restraining order issue otherwise than on notice, except where irreparable injury would otherwise result and in such a case a hearing on the merits of the order should be had within a short fixed period, and. if not then continued alter hearing it should forthwith lapse. Decisions should be rendered immediately, and the chance of delay minimized in every way. Telegraph and telephone companies engaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the in terstate commerce commission. 1 he fight against adequate govern ment control and supervision of indi vidual, and especially of corporate wealth engaged In interstate business 1» chiefly done under cover and espe cially under cover of an appeal to states rights. Forty or fifty separate state governments cannot exercise con trol over corporations doing business in most or all of them. Such divided authority cannot regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central government is the only power which without oppression, can thoroughly and adequately control ami supervise the large corporations. There is legisla tion which the federal government alone can enact and which is absolute ly vital in order to secure the attain ment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the national government of the great interstate corporations, including years, undo the mischief being done a simple method of account keeping publicity, supervision of the issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short time franchises for all corpora tions engaged in public business, in cluding the corporations which get power from water rights. There should be national as well as state guardian ship of mines and forests. The labor legislation hereinafter referred to should concurrently be enacted Into law. To omplish this, means, of course, a certain Increase in the use of—not the creation of—power, by the central government. The power already ex-, ists it does not have to be created, the only question is whether It shall P* used or left idle—and meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain Idle. If there is any one duty which more than another we owe it to our-chil dren and our children's Forests, children to perform at once, it is to save the forests of this country, for they constitute the first and most important element in the conservation ot the natural re sources of the country. Thanks to our own recklessness in the use of our splendid forests, we have already i rossed the verge of a timber famine in this country, and no measures that we now take can, at least for many and it would be in the highest degree reprehensible to let any consideration of temporary convenience or tempo lary cost interfere with such action, especially as regards the national forests which the nation can now, at this very moment, control. Nothing should be permitted to stand in the way of the preservation of the forests, and it is criminal to permit Individuals to purchase a little gain for themselves through thr- de struction of forests when this destruc tion is fatal to the wellbeing of the whole country in the future. Action should be begun forthwith, during the present session of congress for the improvement Inland of our inland water Waterways. ways—action which will result in giving us not only navigable but navigated rivers. We have spent hundreds of «Meeting labor and the millions upon these waterways, yet traffic on nearly all of them is steadily declining. This condition is the di/ect result of the absence of any comprehensive and far-seeing plan of waterway improvement. It is poor business to spend money for inland navigation unless we get it. u» v.uii^ iauui status of the wage-worker are called to the attention of Labor. congress by the presi v. dent.

These needs should be met without further dilly-dallying or delay. The plan which promises the best and quickest results is that of a permanent commission authorized to co-ordinate the work of all the government depart ments relating to waterways, and to frame and supervise the execution ot a comprehensive plan. Tho pure food legislation has al ready wc^ked a ben Pure Food. efit difficult to over estimate. The president renews his recom mendation for postal savings banks, for depositing Postal savings with the Savings Banks, security of the government be hind them. The object is to encourage tnrift and economy in the wage-earner and person of moderate means. Postal savings banks are now in operation in practically all the great civilized coun tries with the exception of the United States. The establishment of a local parcel post on rural routes would be to the mutual benefit of the Parcel Post, farmer and the country storekeeper, and it is desirable that the routes, serving more than 13,000,000 people should be utilized to the fullest prac ticable extent. The postmaster gen eral estimates that the revenue derived from the opratlon of such a system on all the rural routes would amount to many million dollars. The president urges that the request of the director of the census in connec tion with the dec--n- Census. nial work so soon to be begun, be com plied with and that the appointment to the census force be placed under the civil service law, waiving geographical requirements. All soldiers' homes should be placed under the complete Soldiers' control of the war Homes. department. The immediate admission of New Mexico and Arizona as states is ad vocated by the president. This should be done, he says, at Statehood. the present session of congress. The people of the two territories have made it evi dent by their votes that they will not come In as one state. The only al ternative is to admit them as two, and this should be done without delay. The work on the Panama canal is being done with speed, efficiency and entire devotion to duty, which make it a model for all work Panama Canal, of the kind. No task of such mag nitude has ever before been undertaken by any nation and no task of the kind has ever been better performed. The importance of those islands is apparent, says the president, and the need of improving their condition is urgent. The nation- Hawaii. al government must provide the neces sary harbor Improvements on each Isl and, so that the agricultural products can lie carried to the marftets of the world. The coastwise shipping laws should be amended to meet the special needs of the islands, and the alien contract labor law should be so modi fied In its application to Hawaii as to enable American and European labor to be brought thither. The Filipino people, through their officials, are making real steps in the direction of self-government. Under the present system The Philippines, of just laws and sympathetic admin istration. we have every reason to be lieve that they are gradually acquiring the character which lies at the basis of self-government. The president trusts that within a generation the time will arrive when the Philippines can decide for themselves whether it is well for them to become inde pendent, or to continue under the pro tection of a strong and disinterested power, able to guarantee to the islands order at home and protection from foreign invasion. The president again recommends that American citizenship Porto Rico. be conferred upon the people of Porto Rico. In Cuba our ocrtipancy will cease is about two months' time the Cubans have in an orderly manner elected their own governmental Cuba. authorities, and the islands w ill be turned over to them. Our occupation on this occasion has lasted a little over two years, and Cuba has thriven and pros pered under it. As regards the army the president calls attention to the fact that while our junior officers and enlisted men stand very high, tho The Army. present system of promotion by senior ity results in bringing into the higher grades many men of mediocre capacity, who have but a short time to serve. I The scope of retiring boards should be extended so that they could consider general unfitness to command for any cause, in order to secufe a far more rigid enforcement than at present in the elimination of officers for mental, physical or temperamental disabilities. But this plan Is recommended only if congress does not see fit to provide what in the president's judgment is far better that is, for selection in promotion, and for elimination for age. Officers who fail to attain a certain rank by a certain age should be retired. Now that tho organized militia, the national guard, has been incorporated with the army as a National Guard, part of the national forces, it behooves the government to do every reasonable thing in its power to perfect its effi ciency. It should be assisted in its in struction and aided more liberally than heretofore. There should be legisla tion to provide a complete plan for or ganizing the great body of volunteers behind the regular army and national guard when war has come. The president approves the recom mendations of the general board foi the increase of the The Navy. navy, calling especial attention to the need of additional destroyers and colliers, and above all, of the four battleships. It is desirable to complete as soon as possible a squadron of eight battle ships of thu best existing type. The North Dakota, Delaware, Florida and Utah will form the first division of this squadron. The four vessels proposed will form the second division. It will be an improvement on the first, the ships being of the heavy, single cali ber, all big gun type. The president most earnestly recommends that the general board be by law turned into a general staff. There is literally no ex cuse for continuing the present bureau organization of the navy. The navy should be treated as a purely military organization, and everything should be subordinated to the one object of se curing military efficiency. Nothing better for the navy from every standpoint has ever occurred than the cruise of the battle fleet around the world. The improvement of the ships in every way has been ex traordinary. and they have gained far more experience In battle tactics than they would have gained if they stayed •in Atlantic waters. The American people have cause for profound grati tude. both in view of the excellent condition of the fleet as shown by thl» cruise, and in view of the improve ment the cruise has worked In thla already high condition.

PROSECUTE SHELTER TRUST Government's Right to Protect Forest Reserves Guides President in Decision. BIG SMELTERS MAY BE CLOSED President Orders Bill in Equity Filed Against Copper Trust's Ana* mmii Plant. Washington, "Dec. 8. President Roosevelt has decided that the right of the government, to protect its own property gives him sufficient authori ty to proceed against the Anaconda properties of the smelting trust, and inasmuch as thousands of acres of forest reserves are alleged to be in danger of destruction from the poison ous fumes from the smelters, he has the proper officials actively at work on plans to end the nuisance. The attorney general had advised that a bill in equity be filed in the United States courts in Montana to this end. The president, after consul tation with department officials, in cluding Solicitor General Hoyt. agreed that a bill in equity was the best means presented, out he was anxious that there be a certainty of results if the bill was filed and the suits be gun. Agent to Investigate. He therefore gave instructions that an agent of the department of justice should procced to the mines and make a thorough report as to the actual damage done and whether it was like ly to Increase. This step of the president had the efTect of increasing the alarm of the trust people, who expected to dispose of the whole matter at a conference With the president Saturday. Department officials who talked on the subject yesterday said that the case was a very plain one and no court could fail to sustain a bill in equity when filed by the department. It is because of the determination of the government to proceed at once •with its strong hand that the mine owners and smelters are afraid that an injunction would either cause grave and expensive changes in their ways of doing business, or restrict their output, which would cause a loss running up into the millions. A big fight is therefore expected when the bill in equity is filed. The ability of the trust to flght the government is only measured by its money, which is practically unlimited. If the smelters are actually closed down from 12,000 to 15.000 men will be thrown out of work and the output of the company immensely decreased. Poisons Self and Child. Holley Grove. Ark.. Dec. 8.
