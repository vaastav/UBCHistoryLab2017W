SENATOR REED ASKS A PERTINENT QUESTION If He Was Right in His Contention Then Is He Now Entitled to Justice Sustains His Position by Quoting from Message of President Wilson Delivered Last Week Senator James A. need Is now at I hls'post In Washington, and Is feeling, according to his letter, more satisfied with the course that he pursued laat session than he was before President Wilson delivered his great message to Congress In Joint assembly nt the con venlng of the piesent session. The whole country rend, and knew of his efforts In the rename In reference to the proposed food administration of this country when It was proposed at the last session and the efforts that he made to defeat or modify certain parts of It and also the criticism to which he fell heir on nccount of those efforts on his-pait. Now that Presi dent Wilson has delivered his message Senator Reed points out the features of the Hoover bill ,to which he took exception and cites Presldenf Wilson's message as proof. In the following letter sent out to the Mlsouil press Senator Heed says: To the Members of the Missouri press 

"WASHINGTON, Dec. 7, 1917. At the time the Food Control Bill was before Congress I contended that It would work an Injustice to the farmer because It proposed to control the prices or restrict the free market of the things the farmer had to jsell, but did not protect him against ex cessive prices on the things he had to buy, and that the bill thus framed was. Inequitable. I Insisted that It the price of the farmer's products iv ere to be controlled then the pi ice of those tilings he used must be simi larly controlled. These statements I repeated from i1t 4 r Aat anil In tit f v frtrmo R. raiiRA T iiiM Hn I wtn iiinnitnc!Pfi n an " .. obstructor and b some een us an enemv of the Kepubllc and hb a friend of Germany.

REED." From the ConxrcKsloiuiI Ilecortl Senator Heed's predictions as to the workings of the Food Control Bill for which he was criticised as fighting tho President, June 29 and August 4, 1917: t' "Mr. need. What I am trjlnjr, to lm-pi-cM niton the Senator Is tliat If jou deny to the fanner the benerit of the competition of the world for that which ho produces, ou must give to him a protection against tho compe tition of tho world In that which ho Is to purcluise, . "Now, I call the Senator's attention to this fact: The farmer Is a con sumer as well as a producer, and on the average he consumes Just exactly s much as any other man. He has to have boots and shoes; and If you make him sell his wheat In a con trolled market, you must give him his boots and shoes from that same market, so that he gets them equit ably. He must have barbed wire for his fences. He must have agricultur al Implements to till his fields. He must have wagons. He must have harness. He must have groceries. "He must have sugar and tea and coffee. He must have everything that every ordinary person Jn the world amount as the discretion of the fed has. Now, If you inako him sell In a'eral court may direct. controlled market, must you not In the very nature of thlucn glvo lilm tlio benefit of purchasing In tlmt same controlled market, niWt put It all with in one agency? Where can you stop? Mr, Page, "May I ask the Senator If he is without any qualification In favor of covering all of the neces ;sarles of life by this bill and allowing 2Mr. Hoover, or anyone for him, to make the price?" Mr. Ileedi-"I am If we pans the bill giving control of the farmer's product; then I shall Insist upon the other, "My own theory about the matter Is that the thing to do Is to get the spec ulator and attend to him wherever he exist, to get the hoarder and at tend to him wherever he exists, and we have laws that govern that al ready; to give a control over the ex changes of the country so that all gambling can be taken out, and we have already passed that statute through the Senate, although it has not been accepted by the House. My theory, then. Is that having done those things e should do everything possi ble to promote as large a production we can. and that then we would have to protect our country against the sGUIon of Europe the term used and that that In lt-lf Is going to con- tiol the farmer's prices a good deal, It Is a very dangerous power unless It is very carefully emplojed, but 1 am' willing to give that, and my theory is that that is about all we can do.
