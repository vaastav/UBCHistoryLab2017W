Hftcvea, of this cify, as President of tin- American Public Health Association, appears iu full on another page. Dr. KiBVfS makes the strong point that the Government owes to the public health h practical and liberal care, and this idea ho f .jjiportH with" forcible argument. His addrw* i.? n highly creditable production, and o iglit to bo widely read. Tut sudden death of William II. Vanderb'lt will hatdiyshoek tho country, for Mr. Vanderbfftand the public hnvc never been en good terms. He has indeed devoid t* benevolent use some of his colof*al fortune, but there is abroad a wellwflul belief that such an accumulation of wealth cannot lo fairly made in two gene 4lior.H, and [ho public haB felt that it hul an unsettled account with Willism ii. Vanderbiit and[his father. The sudden death teaches the uncertainty of life, but tho death of a man who works lor a dollar a day brings tho same leMori. The bulk of Mr. Vanderbilt's c*ute is likely to he kept within the /itniiy limits, hs his father's wo? before, e > that (here ii not likely to be any /(real chango ia tho management of the Vanderbilt railroad inten-flts. Tun President's cues sage contMna much that ii well conceived, many suggestions for tlie advancement of the public welfare, and somo very blunt drives at his prtfiltrojwors of another party which give to the document something of the'east of h partisan pamphlet. The feature of the mewaije thut will llrst attract attention is ito great and unusual length. Surely thoru is nothing in the "utato of tho Union" which requires so elaborate and minute a review of the country's affairs; nor waiJt nemwry to ar*uo at so groat a length ' proportion* which have all tho force c( axioms. The President goes step by step over trouim whieb, has been thoroughly covered iu the departmental reports, which in their turn have been devoid largely to reviewing by departments tho operations <A the Government trout it* foundation. Tiie aim of tho President, it may bo presumed, is to havo his communication real by t'.>ngress and by tho country, the 1 pruujiumv ui nuiui uuinaum DUu ? inveree ratio to the length of the document. It a incase of this length is to come often newspiipera which aim at "many things, uot much," will he forced to "boil it down," or bo condemned for , printing long-winded productions which nobody has the patience to wade through. The next fair criticism is that the Presldent does not employ the English language ni(h facility, lie writes as one who labors , at the t&bk, and aorao of hia sentences are m )re involved than they need be. In this lu)t respect, however, he does not equal tho Secretary of tho Treasury, whoae atyla ii slovenly, involved and etrikingly lack- i in< perspicuity. Mr. Cleveland iu not the only President who has written long menaces, hut ho will hold hia own with the longest-winded of them all. . * ' (Juugrontluuul HiiUiri.

Pending them* occurrences a (juustlon of much importance whs presented by decreea of tho Columbian government proclaiming tho closure of certain ports tnen in tho hands of the revolutionists to be practical and liablo to capture by aay power. To neither of these propositions could tho United Status assent an effective closure of ports not in possession of the Government, but held by hostile partisans, could not hu recognized. Neither conld the vessels ol insurgents against the legitimate sovereignty bo .deemed hotta humanl unit within the precincts of international I law, whatever might be the definition and Knalty of their acta under the municipal v of the State against whose authority I they were in revolt. The denial by this Government ui tuo Columbian propositions did not. however, imply the admis* tion of a belligerent status on the part ol the insurgents. The Columbian government has expressed ita willingness to negotiate conventions for the adjustment by arbitration of claims by foreign citizens arising out of the destruction of the city of Aspinwali by the insurrectionary forces. AH AMBB1CAX CANALTIIKOl'UII TIIB IBTIIMCS. The intorest of the United States in a practicable transit of ships across the strip q( land separating the Atlantic from the Pacific ho0 boon repeatedly manifested during the last half century. My immediate predecessor caused to bo negotiated with Nicaragua a treaty lor the construction by and at tlx* 00)0 voat nl tho United States ol a canal through Nicaragua territory and laid it before the Senate. Pending the action of that body thereon, 1 withdrew the treaty lor reexamination. Attentive considerations ol it* provision* leads mo to withoid it from resubmission to thn Senate, maintaining aI do, the tenet* of alien precedents, from Washington's day. which pro*cribo entangling alliance* with foreign states. I do not favor a policy of acquisition of new and distant territory oi the incoriioraUon ol remote interest* with onrowu. The lawn of progress are vita: and organic, ami we luuet bo conscious of that irrefutable tido of commercial expansion, which, uh the concomitant of our Motive civilisation day by day, is being urgeu ob wan I by those i across-rig facilities 01 production, transportation and communication to which btcam and electricity hav? given birth. Hut our duty in the present instructs ua to address ourselves mainly t< the development of the van: re*oarcea 01 the great urea committed to our charge and the cultivation of the art* of peace within our borders, though jealously aleri in preventing the American hemtrphere froin being involved in the political problem! and com plications of distant governmentfl. Therefore, I am unable to recommend propositions involving permanen; privileges of ownership or right outside 01 our own territory when coupled with ab solute and unlimited engagements to defend the territorial integrity of the StaU where such interests lie. While iho general project of coonectin# the two oceans by mean! of a canal i? to y be encouraged, 1 aiu of the opinion tha: | any scheme to that end to bo considered with favor should be free from the feature alluded to. The Tehiuntepeeroate is do clared, by engineera ol the highest repute and by competent Scientists, to afford at t entirely practicable transit for vessels ami ( cargoes by moans of a ship railway iron , the Atlantic to the Peddc. The ohviont c advantages of such a route, if feasible, ] over others more remote from the axia v lines of traJlic between Kurope and the Pacific, ami particularly between the Val- , ley of tlii) Mississippi and tho westen. M joast of North and South America, are de- ( icrving of consideration. ^ icrona tijfc? bar/ifrdividing the twogreatest . inaritinio areas of the wodd, n uube fothe world's benefit, a trust for mankind t< , be removed from the chance of doininv , uon by any singlo power, nor become * point of invasion for liostiliUim or prist j for warlike ambition. An engagemen' combining the construction, ownership ind operation of such a work by this gov arnment with an offensive ami defensive 1 allianctS for its protection witn the foroigr h itate, whose responsibilities and iij(hta w? A would share, is, in my judgment, inconlisteut with Mien deification to universe tnd noutral iue. and would, moreover, s entail measures for its realization beyond c Lhe scope of our national polity or present * means. ti The lapse of roars has abundantly confirmed the wisjom and foresight of thosi r, earlier administrations which, long before o Lhe conditions of maritime intercoms, n were changed and enlarged by the progress c 3i ago proclaimed the vital need of inter* ? jceanie transit across the American Isth- .j musand cons-crate 1 in advance to the u :ommon use of mankind by their pasitivo I declarations and through the formal oldi ij jation of treaties. Toward such realiz iion the efforts of tuy administration will a 36 applied, evur bearing in mind the prin- d ;iples on which it must rest, unit which c were declared in no uocerUin tones by h Mr. Cass, who while Secretary of State in ii 1858, announced, that '-What the Uuited h Stales wants in Central America m xt to a lhe happiness of its people is the securitv v IUUuuuiiwmy uiiukoiutcauibiguug mum o ead through it." The cotwUuc- d ion of these trans-continental lints of ci ail way, all in successful operations,wholly c within our territory, uniting the Atlantic b ind Pacific oceans, has been accompanied a; )V result* of a uiost interesting and '"> irrssive nature, and bos created new con- tl litiona not ii> the rmjtes of commerce only u jut in political geography, which power- ii lullv affect our relations toward and neces- it lariiy increase our interests in any trans ? athmjun route Jwftlch may ho opened and tl miplayed for the enda of peace and tratlic, 1 >r in other contingencies, for uses iuimi- ii 'ttl to hath. a Transportation is a factor in tho cost cf d :onunoditiea scarcely socond to that of p heir production, and weighs oa heavily lpon.thp couaumer.

TIIK ALASKA IIOl'KOAnr.
