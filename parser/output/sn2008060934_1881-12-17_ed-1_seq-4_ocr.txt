A story of a wolf's affection for a man is told by F. Cuvier. The animal had been brought up like a puppy, and con tinued with its owner until full grown, when it was presented to the menagerie at Paris. For several weeks it was so disconsolate at the separation from its master, who had been obliged to travel, and so persistently deolined food, that it was feared it would die. Eventually, however, its grief moderated, it took food, and was supposed to have forgotten its former owner. But at the expira tion of eighteen months the master re turned ; the wolf recognized his voice amid the crowd in the gardens, and upon being released from confinement bounded toward him, exhibiitng violent joy. Agaiu separated from its master, the faithfnl creature was once more afflicted as on the former occasion, until after an absence of three years the object of its affection revisited the gardens. It was evening, and the wolf's den had been shut up for the night ; but the instant the man's voice was audible the poor animal began to utter such anxious cries that the door of its cage was opened, when it darted to wards its friend, leaped upon him and caressed him, and threatened the keepers when they attempted to sepa rate them. When its old master finally left it, the animal became ill, refused all food, and although it reoovered aftet a long time, it grew fierce and resented the familiarities of all strangers. After having once given its affection, it seemed to scorn any further objects of friendship. Magnificent pine forests have lately been discovered on tho upper waters of the Saskatchewan, and explorers have traced them fifty miles up the shonlder 

FARM, (UROEN AND HOUSEHOLD. Household Hints. Dip bowl in boiling water before creaming your butter. . Always use knives for catting, not for stirring or chopping. White pepper should bo used for delicate dishes. In beating butter always take the back of your spoon. Yeast is best kept in glass jars, cov ered. Two double kettles prevent danger of burning, and liquid boils quicker on account of heat on all sides. When breaking eggs be careful not to let the yolk of the egg touch the sharp edge of the egg shell. Tablespoonful of flour is to be piled high, but butter must be level with the edges of the spoon. Success with Hniall Fruits. E. T. Bowe, in an address to the New York Horticultural Society, says : "To give tho secret of success in small fruit culture in a brief formula, I should say that it is contained in two stimulation, restriction. By stimulation I mean a deep, thor oughly pulverized and enriched soil. This is especially essential to the straw berry, the foreign raspberry, and all the currants. A rampant growing rasp berry, like the Outhbert or Turner, and our vigorous blackberries,, do not require stimulation, but they do restriction. You cannot make the ground too deep, too rich, for the straw berry if there is adequato restriction. By restriction I mean the-develop ment of fruit rather than wood or vines. Set out a strawberry plant in very deep, rich, moist soil, and its first tendency is to follow the great law of nature and propagate itself, but to the degree that it makes plants it cannot make fruit. Out off every runner and enormous fruit buds are developed. The sap is dammed up as a miller restricts a stream, and the result is strawberries that are double in size and quantity. This is equally true of raspberries. To the degree that there are suckers there is less fruit. If a currant bush is crowded with wood— too old or too young—there are few currants. Moreover, by cutting back a raspberry cane in spring one-third, yon add one-third to tho size and abundance of the fruit. • Shelter Snves Fond—ls l*r»fitnhli>. Every keeper of animals would actu ally profit by a little study of chemistry and physiology. Here is a short lesson . All kinds of food, as hay, grain, bread, meat, etc., are, like wood, mainly com posed of charcoal (carbon) and water, with considerable nitrogen in some of them. To prove this, strongly heat any of the above food materials in a coalpit, or better, under glass. Water, with some nitrogen gas, will be driven off and can be found in the glass receiver, while only charcoal wiil remain. Let in more air and the charcoal itself will unite with the oxygon of the atmos phere, and also go off as a transparent, invisible carbonic acid gas. This chem ical notion sets at liberty heat that was before concealed or insensible, the same as when wood or coal is burned rapidly in a stove, producing an active firo ; or as when wood decays, but gives off heat so slow as not to be observed. Exactly the same thing occurs when any food is dissolved (digested) in the stomach of animals or men, and is taken* into the blood and carried lo all parts of the body. The blood gets oxygen also from the air in the lungs, and car ries it all through the body. The atoms of oxygen meet the atoms of digested food, here, there and everywhere in the blood vessels. The two unite just as they do in a stove; heat is produced, only in minute quantity at any one point, but a great deal of it, taking the whole blood circulation together, and so the whole body is kept warm, though heat is constantly escaping from the whole outside surface. Nature provides that the body shall always be kept warm, otherwise it would quickly perish ; and so if the oxygen in the blood don't find food enough to loop up the internal heat, it will attack and consnme any fat or flesh stored in the body, and thus make the animal poor. We miml have an ever-burning-fire in both the animal and hnman system. If the surrounding atmosphere is oold, and oirries off heat rapidly from the surface of the body, we must increase the internal production of heat by putting in more food, or by surround ing the body with a covering that will prevent the escape of much boat. Is it not plain, thou, that by keeping animals warm by means of close build ings, or shelter against heat-stealing winds, less food will be needed, and there will be less waste of flesh in making heat? Any arrangement of shelter, cover, stable, shed, blankets— anything that will prevent the natural warmth from passing away from the surfaoe of any animal—will be a great saving of food required to keep np the absolutely necessary internal life warmth ; will prevent loss of flesh ; will allow the food to go moro to adding to weight of flesh, or the yield of mijk, o r of wool. Shelter and external warmth in cold weather are most economical and therefore profitable in the keeping of farm stock. ' The Farmer's Oorn. At early dawn, when on the leaves The hoar-frost creeps and steals their bloom, When trees Bland stiff in gloonl Beneath the sunless morn, Old Farmer John salutes his sheaves ? Of ripened oorn. Bright jewels 'mong the stuhblo gleam, And sparkle from his caroless tread, And gossamer, outspread. Unrobes the naked thorn ; Bnt Farmer John, to all a-dream, Moves through his corn. The startled hare before him springs, And down the furrow speeds like wind, While crisp leaves spirt behind ; The yellow mists up-borne, Skim o'er the vale'on noiseless wings Above the corn. But Farmer John, with anxious eyes, The struggling streaks of dawn surveys And, through the spreading bane That veils the face of morn, A blood-rod rim ho sees ariso To greet his com. And fear creeps through his trembling veins As the rising sun dilates in red, And, as each mountain's head His crimson hues adorn, John quakes to thiuk the coming rains May Swamp his corn. Still high o'erhcad the waning moon Revoals a patch of clearing blue, And hope comes peeriug through With Luna's welcome horn, That yot a favoring sky at noon Will bless the corn. The changeful sun, erst steeped in fire, Behold, pours forth rich amber streams That quench with bright joy-gleams The frowns his face had worn, For heaven and he may now conspiro • To save tho corn. See, o'or the oast a golden mantle's flung ! Fast moves the inißt from out tho north, Aud, as the winds come forth, To littlo shreds aro torn The groat cloud-massos that o'orhun _ Tho golden corn. And lo ! the wakened crows soar high ; How arrow-straight they upward fly O'er bits of dappled sky ; Ami leave the earth forlorn ; While clouds of lazy rooks float by The tempting corn. What smiles sloop in tho farmer's eyes ! To-day he'll "in" that precious grain, For ho who knows the rain, Such boilings dares not scorn. So, whistling thanks to sun md skies, He leaves the corn.
