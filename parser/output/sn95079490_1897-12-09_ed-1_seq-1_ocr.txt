THR WKATIIBH. ) ROAN< NO CURRENCY LEGISLATION. Impossible to Carry Out the Ad? ministration's Plan. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY . DIVI? DED?THE SENATE WILL NOT TOLERATE THE IDEA OP DE? STROYING THE GREENBACKS. SENATORS AND REPKESENTA TIVES DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT AND INDULGING IN ADVERSE CRITICISM. Washington,Dec. 8.?The impossibility of I ho Republicans effecting any legisla? tion on the currency question at this ses? sion of Congress wia strikingly ^illustra? ted yesterday by the family row in the House ovei the disposition of that part of I he message relating to monetary mat? ters. While this was,being discussed on tho one side, Senators wore quietly talk inu about tho possibility of doing any? thing in the Senate. Leaders of the finance committee have looked into the question, and one of the most prou: incut last evening said that ^it would be au ab? solute waste of time to attempt to do anyt hing: that '.the .situation would be made even worse than it *in and that the suio result of the agitation of the sub? ject would be a fiee coinage bill. The severe criticism of the President's message has only been accentuated by the annual report of Secretary .(Jage and his recommendations. Tho President might have been a little ambiguous, but there is no ambiaulty about what Secre? tary Gage seeks to accomplish. '.Both the message and the report will be ignored. Not one republican could 'be fouud yes torday who would express the belief that, there wa? the 'least possible chance for legislation. If the leaders in tho Senate have[their way they will avoid courting responsi? bility. Debate cannot, however, be stilled,and there will be much said about thu money question, but the passage of the bi'l by the House would eventually bring the matter heforo the Senate,where it would remain as a standing subject for discussion for iveeks. Republicans who talk freely in private are condemning the President for forcing this matter upon the Congress. Oue of the most influential Senators on tho Re? publican side said yesterday that the President was urged not to take this sub? ject up seriously for the reason that his own party was not agreed upon it and the recommendations would only show tho weakness of the party to ^the opposi? tion. It is clear that the. President, with the lack of decision characteristic of him.has sought to straddle the currency question. He has at tempted to"ionciliale the gold men with the indirect suggestion of the retirement of the greenbacks, and lias thrown out a palpable bid for silver friendship by suggesting the possibility of something further from tho Wo'cott commission. The silver men ncce) t the challenge, thai has been given them, anil in Iiis messaub Mr. McKinley has given the Democrats some of the best campaign literature they have had since the money question became the gieat issue of the day. No party can go before tho people advocating the retirement oT the green? back and the substitution of a non j interest-bearing debt for ono that drawl interest. t Several Senators are preparing to rip this message open and show its weak? ness in debate. Never before has the ab? solute statement been made by any Pres? ident that tho greenbacks should be re? deemed In geld. It is net a matter of law, but of Treasury regulation, and public men point out tho self-evident fact that the whole problem, so far as the "ieen backo are orncerned, would be solved, if the regulat ions were changed so as to re? quire the Treasury anil not the holders of these notes, to designate in what kind of money they shall be redeemed. Senator Bacon, of Georgia, character? izes tho currency scheme as only a shift to supply the deficiency in the quantity of the currency bv fictitious and repre? sentative money instead of real money. Senator Vest says there i re a great manv men in both the President's prrty who will not agree to the retirement of the greenbacks nor to their conversion into gold notes. Nor does he believe tho plan to reduce the taxation upon national bank notes aud give, tho banks power to issue circulation to tlie face va'ue of the security bouds will he adopted. Senator ..ones ihinks the Wnicott com? mission is referred to only to be let down easily To suggest that we may e>pect anything from the work of that commis? sion is, he says, utterly absurd.

H.?In the gentral war to be made on all appropriations and the light for reductions of salaries of public, officials the educational institutions can hardlv escape. Mr. Feat herst one, of Campbell, maintains that if the officers are reduced the colleges must lose the same proportion of their appropriations that is taken from the public, servants. The University gets generally about$45, 000. Of course part of this money goes to pay the "alaries of professors and other officials of that greit institution of learning. It is argued that if the State ollicials have their compensation cur? tailed, why should not the University people have their cut. too. This argu? ment will be pushed for all it is worth when the reform war comes up in the two I bouses.

The Spanish official report describes tho territlc eflects of tho pneumatic dyna? mite gun used ty Gen. Garcia. The in? surgents tired ^seventy two shots on tho fort. Each shot wrought terrible havoc. The gun was operated at a short dis? tance from town. Not a house remains. Besides the dynamite gun the insurgents used two Held pieces, six and eight pounders. Gen. Garcia sent word to tho Spaniards beforo the bombardment that they wonltl be pardoned if they would surrender. Tho only answer Was a shout of "Long live Spain," and a general volley from all the forts. Col. Tovar commands 'ho Spanish brl gado of Manzanillo.

If General P,\udo starts foi Bayamo severe lighting is expected on the road between the two small towns of Pernlejos and Harrain os, where the insurgents are verv strong. The town of [Gisa had 8,000 inhabi? tants. It was only six miles from Bay? amo. In Bayamo .the Spanish garrison number 11,000 men, and it is strange that no attempt was made from Bayamo to save Geisa from utter destruction. An abstract of President McKinley's message to Congress was published by newspapers here last night. The Span? ish authorities, as well as the different political parties, are highly pleased with the conservative trend of the message. As a rule tne secessionists feel greatly disappointed at the President's utter? ances, but many of them declare, that the message nctually favors theii cause, and express confidence that Congress will, at, an early date, take seme definite action as regards Cuba.
