PRATT WANTS TO KILL MORE MEN (Continued from First Page.) Mrs. Sharp, who fired two of the shots that struck Policeman Mullane, was confined in the city jail. Mrs. Pratt bemoaned the death of her daughter, 'Lulu, aged 13, who was shot during ,the second stage of yester day's battle, when the women and children, took a row boat on the 'Mis souri river and attempted to escape. At the hospital this morning..it was said that Patrolman Mullane had small Chances of recovery but that Sergeant Patrick Clark's condition was slightly improved. A. J. Selzer, the bystander, who was hit by a bullet, also is ex pected to recover. 'Mary Pratt, the little 11-year old sister of the dead girl, displayed the same remarkable coolness shown 'by her elders, when questioned by the police. She did not cry when told of her sister's death ':She died for her i God," 'was the child's remark. Mrs. Pratt, in a, statement, told of a the band's work. "Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, our leaders," said Mrs. Pratt, "were known to us d as Adam and Eve and we believed their teachings. It was revealed to Mrs. Sharp last summer that our meetings were not to be interfered with again. We armed ourselves 'If the police attempt to arrest us, shoot,' said our leader. 'They cannot kil me. I'll live 'forever.' The first I heard of i the tragedy yesterday was when Lulu. I and Mary came running down to the boat and told me that the shooting I was going on. "Then the officers dame and wanted to take us away. I got my Winchester downccf the wall; told'Lulu tq get a gun. and we all got into a skidff that was tied to the houseboat. I sat in the bow with mly gun in my hands. I was not going to shoot unless I had to because I had no chance to ask either Adam or Eve what to do. I am .sorrPy I did not resist. i'm afraid I have lost my eternal life, 'becaise I think Adam would have advised me to shoot. "Lulu got into the back of the skif, which was covered, and Mary took the oars and we started across the river. The officers began shooting at the boat. We drifted up to the bank and 'when I saw blood 'on Lulu's ear I knew that she was shot. Then Mary and I got out and hung on the side of the boat until they captured us," Mrs. Melissa Sharp, a slender wo man of middle age, whose statement was taken by anOther officer, detailed the occurrences leading p to yeate day's fight and then told of t.he rwn derings of the band. ITwag born in ifetind a 'r o 37 years ago, on a'fEl" s;i' Sharp. "I married Sharp, a far.4 ;20@ yearis ago and we went to.,it f Later we went to Oki.hola and tai+ up a claim. We had atsla , Albout six years:ago my hiss band came home one night; and said he dldL iot-think we were living right. He had' hasd a revelation o9pihc. faitih of God.; We began to reid thie Bble'..td a week later, I got the revelation. Then we both repented for two weeks, we mourned-not because we wanteld to, but because we could not help it. The spirit of God came to us the same as it came to Adam, David and Christ. We then sold our farm and gave =the money 'away to people who needed it and started out to preach. "Since then we have traveled through Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois. Then we went north to Minnesota and last summer spent some time in North Dakota. One man vvho found the light sald allfhis property and 'put $7,000 l' a common fund. "About last August when we came back from Canada we built a house. boat and started down the Missouri river from a place in~ontana near White Earth. "We floated down the river stopping and preaching at (towns and some times camping in the woods. In many places we have been persecuted by the officers who 'wanted to take our chil dren away from us and make them go to school. "Me 'have been armed 'for many months. I have 'practiced shooting and 'my older children have practiced shooting. None of the children can read' or write. We teach them, but we teach them righteousness. Paul says 'the wisdom of the world is foolish. Christ chose his disciples from ignor. ant people. Christ did not 'go to school. My husband and I 'can read and write. That is enough to teach the Bible." Chief of Police Ahearn announiced that yesterday's bloodshed affair would mark an end to street meetings in Kansas City and ordered his men to allow no more speakers to address crowds on public thoroughfares.
