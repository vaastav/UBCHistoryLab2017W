PAINTER & HERR, Editors and Business Manager?. WEDNESDAY, DEC. 13, 1S99. OFFICIAL CITY PAPER. We hear considerable roar ing about high taxes, especi ally in and around Medicine Lodge. They are getting what they voted for. It's hard on the innocent ones, though. Not one of our republican exchanges (excepting the Ki owa News) has a kind word for Jo Hudson and the Tope ka Capital since that paper has been taking the epider mis off of Cy LelancTs car cass. They are nearly all terrorized by the bosses. Secretary Gage, in his re port to congress, asks for ap propriations for the year be ginning June au, iyuu, m the amount of $631,000,000. 00. This is 34,000,000.00 dollars more than the amount appropiated last year. You can hear plenty of men talk who voted for Mc Kinley three years ago who say they will not do it again without going away "on the cars." The people have had about enough imperialism, gold standard and monopoly supremacy The Topeka Capital de votes one-half of its editorial space to denouncing trusts, and the other half to sup porting the party and the system which foster trusts and protects them in robbing the people. Consistency! We submit that if the re publican leaders in Barber county read Oscar Haberlein out of the republican party and boycott his paper, they ought to boycott the Topeka capital also. VYeiiKeto see consistency in politics as wel as in every-day business. The Boers are putting up a mucli better ngnt man John Bull expected. Of course, England will ulti mately win because of her superior numbers but it will require millions more of "The best message ever writ ten since the time of Lincoln" has again made its appear ance, according to the repub lican press. They said the same thing of Harrison's mes sages, and of McKinley's mes sage last year. It's an old stereotyped g. o. p. phrase which is called into service every year. Judge Francis C. Price has tenderd his resignation to Gov. Stanley, effective Jan. 1 1900, and will remove to Ohio and engage in an exten blood and .treasure than!sive law Practice. Judge British statesmen calculated. The wholesale grocers of Kansas and Missouri are in a great stew on account of the manner in which the trusts are serving them especially the continental tobacco com pany. All profit on tobacco has been cut off, excepting what is bought through H. D. Lee, a broker selected by the company to become its agent. The continental com pany holds the key , to the situation and the dealers can do nothing more than kick. They're getting it all along the line. Good! - The republican claim that Kansas is stronger republi can this fall than she was a year ago, is not founded on fact. A comparison of the re turns of '98-99 shows that the republicans sustained a loss of 10 per cent this year. Barber is the only county in the southern part of the state in which the republicans gained over .last year1s vote. In Harper, Kingman, Pratt. Sumner, Comanche, Sedg wick, Harvey, Reno and. Cow ley the Populist trains are tremendous. We admit that the republican brag and bluster, so far as Barber county is concerned, is back ed up .by. the returns, but when you cross the line in any direction the time chang es, ' - Price sits in the district west comprising Comanche, Clark T71 3 3 l . r oru ana several otner coun ties. He has been j udge of the district since the spring of 1889. The president's message has all the earmarks necessary to convince any well informed man tbt it was written according to the dictation of combined wealth. The people are gettinsr what they voted for. ' '; : Thebe is nothing in the Baker-Burton row except a question as to where the senatorial plum shall land. If the people of Kansas are awake to their in terests they will elect a Populist legis lature and shut out both ot those political frauds. ' Between Baser and Barton there Is no choice. They are both corporation lawyers. The "national excellence of our food products" receives some consideration in the president's message, which re minds us that as a matter of fact there is very little pure food of any kind on the market. It is all adulterated so that in the majority of cases it is . not only poor in quality but injurious to the system all because it is handled by corporations for profit. The man wno wrote tne message displayed re markable skill in evndins the facts. There is at at least one republican in Barber couuty who needs to cultivate a little more of the product known as common sense. The gentleman in question is not an Index subscriber but he borrows the paper and reads it every week. Last week he read what was said about Judge Hook and his de cision on the court of visitation, and he was horrified, incensed and almost demented. He thought it was evidence of much cheek for such a small paper to criticise such a great man as Judge Hook. The fact alone that a man was able to land a life-time federal job ought to forever exempt him from crit icism, except, perhaps, from those in equally high places; but our republican friend thinks it is almost treason for a weekly newspaper in this neck-of-the- woods to do aught but pay tribute to the talents of the great man at the pi9 counter who, he imagines, are only sec ond to the Omnipotent himself. In answer to our republican critic, we have this to say: In the first place it is a fact known to every man who is in the least Informed, that of ten-times of ficial positions are held by very ordi nary men. The fact tnat a man holds an office, federal or otherwise, does not make him a Solon nor a saint. Indeed it is often the case that the chump of the greatest caliber can be found at the pie counter enjoying a princely salary. Sometimes a veritable ignoramus has a pull with a sleek politician at his back and thus becomes a child of fortune gets a good office, when he really hasn't sufficient talent of bis own to steel a superannuated biscuit out of a swill barrel. In the second place, admitting that the officeholders are eminently wise, is it not a matter of history that they bave been known to lose sight of the public good in order that they might themselves wax the fatter and improve their financial condition? Of fice-seekers are necessarily ambitions, and ambition prompts men to strive for wealth and power, and the only question is the means to an end. Hence when wealth goes into a tribun al out of the reach of the people for special favors they are granted in most cases. There is nothing surprising about it it is naturally to be expected under the present system. But the surprising thing is that when somebody protests against the system and ad vocates a change for the better, some fool nincompoop who is being pressed to the wall as rapidly as any of us, will b )b up and grunt about it simply be cause the system which is criticised is supported by men in lucrative positions while those who protest against the in equality are in the common walks of life. Our good friend only portrays the length of his ears when he prates about "wisdom" and "ignorance" in that strain of. language. The arousing tarce of . sending petl tious to congress has begun again There are a whole lot of people in this country who are etill green enough to think that sending an instrument of that kind to Washington will get them something. With all their opportuni ties to inform themselves they bave not yet learned that a congressman treats a petition with silent contempt ' and hurries it to the waste basket before reading a half a dozn words.

Congressman Roberts shot a heavy load iuto the admin istration when he said in the House the other day that the president has appointed many avowed polygamists to responsible federal positions in Utah. Every member of the tribe of Hanna squirmed when Roberts spoke. The extra session of the Kansas legislature created the Court of Visitation and gave it powers to regulate railroad and telegraph rates. In creating this court the legislature aimed to avoid the effect of the decision of the U. S. Supreme Court in the Nebraska case. But on Monday, of this week, U. S. Judge Hook, holding court at Topeka, held the law granting powers to the court of Visitation to determine the reasonableness of railroad rates to be unconstitutional. Government ownership seems to be the only remedy. Mo. World. The Cresset throws slurs at Oscar Haberlein because he wasHhe republican candidate for representative in 1896 and went down to defeat. The Cresset's ridicule and satire does not cut much ice, how ever. Mr. Haberlein got more votes than vlcKiuley and the state ticket did that year, and only twoi "candidates on the county ticket polled a larger vote. If the Cresset measures Mr. Haberlein's popularity by the vote he received in 1896, he is considerably alive. II. n. Case is agent for the "Rein deer" Bicycle, a high grade wheel, at a close price. Call and see sample. ' - HOT sHOT- National New Era. We people must govern before we will have a good goyernment. Revolutions never go backward, but they sometimes stop to take breath. The man who is not willing to trust the people is a dangerous man for the people to trust: Greed would destroy liberty all over the world, and rivet shackles upon the mass of mankind. There is no power that can lift a peo ple out of bond age but the power of their own manhood. ' The right of people to rule cannot te questioned by anyone who believes in a free government. And now the people will bave time to think about the problem, "What did the election settle?" We are all joint heirs of nature's bounties, and any man or corporatiou that keeps yon from your sbare.ia rob bing you. Irue statesmanship includes secur ing the greatest good to the greatest number and no barm to any number. Is it not a little inconsistent for peo ple to claim. that high pripea cause pios perity and then rail against the trusts for causing high prices? - " ' " The American people are slow to act in resisting evil, but when they are once fully aroused they will make short work of our present system. What is the use of talking about set tling the financial question until we first settle the question of who ' shall haye the the' power of settling all ques tions. . ' . , ',. ; , Despotism consists in being governed by another. It does not chango the fact of despotism that you are permit ted to choose the person who. is to gov ern yon. ' ;' ... There is one thing certain about the present congress, and that is that the masses will not be disappointed whatever it may do or may not do. Nothing has been promised except a continua tion of the goldstandard,high tariff, imperialism, polygamy and monopolistic supremacy. Very few, if any, measures will be enacted. The agents and lobbyists for these insti tutions have already secured all they demanded and there is little left for such a con gress to do but to expend or atory anc heap up expenses by the millions for the peo ple to pay. Instead of taking steps to restrain combined wealth from further oppres sing the people, our congress of corporation hirelings will place a lever irT their hands with which to do the work more easily and with less ex pense. Perhaps it ia all for the best maybe it will be the means of awakening the people to the necessity of self defense, the sooner. THE
