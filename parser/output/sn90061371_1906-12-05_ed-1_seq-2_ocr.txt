PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE Recommends Legislation on New and Important Subjects. INCOME -INHERITANCE TAX He Believes Such Laws Would Curb Growth of Fortunes to Dan gerous Proportions. His Views on Negro Question Asks for Currency Reform, and Shipping Bill Would Make Citizens of Japs Many Other Important Subjects Discussed. Washington, Dec. t. The notable fea tures of President Roosevelt's annual message to congress are his appeal for the enactment into law of several bills Introduced into congress last winter and spring: his views on the negro problem; the scoring he gives those whom he terms "preachers of discontent;" the stand he takes for the control of corpor ations by the federal government under the interstate commerce clause of the constitution, and his recommendation for an inheritance and income tax law. Many other subjects common to mes sages of the chief executive are touched upon, but the ones mentioned are by far of the greatest Importance. He es pecially urges the passage of the bill prohibiting corporations from contribut ing to campaign funds, and also that one which would give the government the right of appeal in criminal cases. Of this he says: "Another bill which has Just past one house of the congress and which Is ur- Jcently necessary should be enacted into aw is that conferring upon the govern ment the right of appeal in criminal cases on questions of law. This right exists in many of the states; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the congress. It Is of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the de fendant on the merits should be set aside. Recently in one district where the government had Indicted certain per sons for conspiracy in connection with rebates, the court sustained the defend ant's demurrer; while in another juris diction an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained under it, and two defendants sentenced to impris onment. The two cases referred to may not be in real conflict with each other, but it Is unfortunate that there should even be an apparent conflict. At pres ent there Is no way by which the gov ernment can cause such a conflict, when it occurs, to be solved by an appeal to a higher court; and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the question. I can not too strongly urge the passage of the bill In question. A failure to pass will result in seriously hampering the government in its effort to obtain justice, especially against wealthy Individuals or corporations who do wrong; and may also prevent the government from obtaining justice for Wageworkers who are not themselves able effectively to contest a case were the judgment of an inferior court has been against them. 1 have specifically in view a recent decision by a district judge leaving railway employees with out remedy for violation of a certain so called labor statute. It seems an absurd ity to permit a single district Judge, against what may be the Judgment of the Immense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare a law solemnly enacted by the congress to be "uncon stitutional," and then to deny to the government the right to have the su preme court definitely decide the ques tion.'; Injunctions. On the subject of the abolition of In junctions in labor disputes, he says: "In my last message I suggested the en actment of a law in connection with the issuance of injunctions, attention hav ing been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of apply ing injunctions in labor cases should be wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolishing altogether the use of Injunctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts; In which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong altogether to prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy with criminals to weaken our hands in upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no impairment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible the abuse of. the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. The Negro Problem. The negro problem Is given considera ble attention, after calling attention to the fact that no section of the country Is free from faults, and that no section has occasion to jeer at the shortcomings of any other section, he turns to the sub ject of lynchings, and especially as ap plied to the negro of the south. He says the greatest existing cause for mob law Is the perpetration by the blacks of tie crime of rape, a crime which he terms even worse than murder. He quotes the admonitions to the white people spoken by Gov. Candler, of Georgia, some years ago, and by Gov. Jelks, of Alabama, re cently, and then says: "Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race is the negro criminal, and above all the ne gro criminal who commits the dread ful crime of rape; and it should be felt as in the highest degree an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race in particular, for a colored man to fall to help the officers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as is the case with murder: assault with in tent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least in the discretion of the court; and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow immediately upon the heels of the offense; while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not be wantonly shamed while giving tes timony, and that the least possible publicity shall be given to the details. The members of the white race on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a loosening of the bands of civ ilization: that the spirit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part In the torture of a hu man being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means Just so much moral deterioration in all the children who have any knowledge of it. and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next generation of Americans. "Let justice be both sure and swift; but let it be Justice under the" law, and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mi. Capital and Labor. On the subject of capital and labor the president takes the agitators of class hatred to task and says "to preaca hatred to the rich man, a3 such. . . . to seek to mislead and inflame to mad ness honest men whose li ves are hard and who have not the kind of mental training which wlil permit them to ap preciate the danger in the doctrines preached is to commit a crime against the body politic and to be false to every Worthy principle and tradition of Amer ican national life." Continuing on this subject he says: "The plain people who think the mechanics, farmers, merchants, work ers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given pop ular government is to elect an un worthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy. Whenever such an issue is raised In this country nothing can be gaineti by flinching from it, for in such case dem ocracy is itself on trial, popular self government under republican forms is itself on trial. The triumph of the mob is just as evil a thing as the tri umph of the plutocracy, and to have escaped one danger avails nothing whatever if we sucuumb to the other. In the end the honest man.whether rich or poor, who earns his own living and tries to deal justly by his fellows, has as much to fear from the insincere and unworthy demagog, promising much and performing nothing, or else performing nothing? bn evil. wh would act on the mob to plunder the rich, as from the crafty corruptionist. who. for Ilia awn ends, would permit the common people to be exploited by tbe very wealthy. If we ever let this government fall into the hands of men of either of these two classes, we shall show ourselves false to America' past. Moreover, the demagog and corrup tionist often work hand In hand. There are at this moment wealthy reaction aries of such obtuse morality that they regard the public servant who prose cutes them when they violate the law, or who seeks to main them bear their S roper share of tbe public burdens, as eing even more objectionable than the violent agitator who hounds on the mob to plunder the rich. There Is nothing to ch?ose between such a re actionary and such an agitator; funda mentally they are alike In their selfish disregard of the rights of others; and it is natural that they should join in opposition to any movement of which the aim is fearlessly to do exact and even Justice to all." Railroad Employees Hours. He asks for the passing of the bill lim iting the number of hours of employment of railroad employes, and classes the measure as a very moderate one. He says the aim of all should be to steadily reduce the number of hours of labor, with a a goal the general in troduction of an eight-hour day, but in sists that on the Isthmus of Panama the conditions are so different from what they are here that the introduction of an eight-hour day on the canal would be absurd, and continues, "Just about as ab surd as it is, so far as the isthmus is concerned, where white labor cannot be employed, to bother as to whether the work is done by alien black men or alien vellow men " He urges the enactment of a drastic child labor law for the District of Co lumbia and the territories, and a federal investigation of the subject of child and female labor throughout the country. He reviews the work of the commission appointed to investigate labor conditions in the coal fields of Pennsylvania in 1902, and refers to the wish of the commission "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may be called the compulsory investiga tion of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." "In this age of great corporate and la bor combinations, neither employers nor employees should be left completely at the mercy of the stronger party to a dis pute, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be In the line of securing recognition of the fact that in many strikes the public has itself an interest which cannot wisely be disregarded; an interest not merely of general conven ience, for the question of a Just and proper public policy must also be con sidered. In all legislation of this kind it is well to advance cautiously, testing each step by the actual results; the step proposed can surely be safely taken, for the decisions of the commission would not bind the parties in legal fashidn, and yet would give a chance for public opin ion to exert its full force for the right." Control of Corporations. A considerable portion of the message Is devoted to the subject of federal con trol of corporations in what he refers to the passage at the last session of the rate, meat inspection and food laws, and says that all of these have already justi fied their enactment, but recommends the amendment of the meat inspection law so as to put dates on the labels of meat products, and also to place the cost of inspection on the packers rather than on the government. Continuing on this subject of the control of corporations by the federal government he says: "It cannot too often be repeated that ex perience has conclusively shown the im possibility of securing by the actions of nearly half a hundred different state legislatures anything but ineffective chaos In the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state. In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more complete control than at present over these great corpora tionsa control that will among other things prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization, and that will compel the disclosures by each big corporation of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the secur ing of inordinate profits by favored individuals at the expense whether of the general public, the stockholders, or the wageworkers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to supervise and control it as to see that it results in no harm to thw people. The reactionary or ultracon servative apologists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a step toward socialism. As a matter of fact It is these reactionaries and ultraconservatives who are them selves mosi potent in increasing socialis tic feeling. One of the most efficient methods of averting the consequences of a dangerous agitation, which is 80 per cent, wrong, is to remedy the 20 per cent, of evil as to which the agitation is well founded. The best way to avert the very undesirable move for the governmental ownership of railways is to secure by the government on behalf of the people as a whole such adequate control and regulation of the great interstate com mon carriers as will do away with the evils which give rise to the agitation against them. So the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper legislation and execu tive action the abolition of the grave abuses which actually do obtain in con nection with the business use of wealth under our present system or rather no svstem of failure to exercise any ade quate control at all. Some persons speak as if the exercise of such governmental control would do away with the freedom of individual initiative and dwarf Indi vidual effort. This is not a fact. It would be a veritable calamity to fail to put a premium upon Individual Initiative, individual capacity and effort; upon the energy, character and foresight which it Is so important to encourage in the individual. But as a matter of fact the deadening and degrading effect or pure socialism, and especially of its extreme form communism, and the destruction of individual character which they would bring about, are in part achieved by the wholly unregulated competition which results In a single individual or corpor ation rising at the expense of all others until his or its rise effectually checks all competition and reduces former competi tors to a position of utter inferiority and subordination. Inheritance and Income Tax. It was expected that the president would refer in some way to his- belief In the necessity for the curbing of enor mous fortunes, and he has done so by recommending legislation for both In come and an inheritance tax. He be lieves the government should impose a graduated inheritance t and. if yiossi ble. a graduated Income tax. He says: "I am well aware that such a subject as this needs long and careful study in order that the people may become famil iar with what is proposed to be done, may clearly see the necessity of proceed ing with wisdom and self-restraint, and may make up their minds just how far they are willing to go in the matter; while only trained legislators tan work out the project in necessary detail. But I feel that in the near future our nation al legislators should enact a law provid ing fr a graduated inheritance tax by which a steadily increasing rate of duty should be put upon all moneys or other valuables coming by gift, bequest, or devise to any individual or coloration. It may be well to make the tax heavy in proportion as the individual benefited is remote of kin. In any event, in my judgment the pro rata of the tax should increase very heavily with the increase of the amount left to any one individual after a certain point has been reached. It is most desirable to encourage thrift and ambition, and a potent source of thrift and ambition is the desire on the part of the breadwinner to leave his chil dren well off. This object can be attained by making the tax very small on moder ate amounts of property left; because the prime object should be to put a con stantly increasing burden on the. inher itance of thrtse swollen fortunes which it is certainly of no benefit to this coun try to perpetuate. There ca-Q be no question of the eth ical propriety of the government thuB de termining the conditions upon which any gift or inheritance should be received. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an Incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of the enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need not approximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. Agricultural Interests. He appeals for every encouragement that the congress can give to the agri cultural interests of the country. - He points to the good that is being done by the various forms of grange organiza tions, and says: "Several factors must cooperate in the improvement of the farmer's condition. He must havo the chance to be educated in the widest possible sense ..v the sense which keeps ever in view the intimate relationship between the theory of edu cation and the facts of life. In all education we should widen our alms. It is a good thing to produce a certain num ber ol trained scholars and students; bat the education superintended T h stats must seek rather to produce a hun dred good citizens than merely one scholar, and It must be turned now and then from the class hook to the study of the great book of nature itself. Th Is especially true of the farmer, as ha been pointed out again and again by alt observers moat competent to pass, prac tical judgment on the problems of our country life. All students now realize that education must seek to train the executive powers of young people and to confer more real significance upon the phrase "dignity of labor," and to pre pare the pupils so that in addition to each developing in the highest degree his individual capacity for work, they may together help create a right public opinion, and show in many ways social and cooperative spirit. Organization has become necessary in the business world; and it has accomplished much for good In the world of labor. It is no less neces sary for farmers. Euch a movement as the grange movement is good in itself and is capable of a well-nigh infinite fur ther extension for good so long as it is kept to its own legitimate business. The benefits to be derived by the association of farmers for mutual advantage are partly economic and partly sociological. Marriage and Divorce. As a means of bringing about national regulation of marriage and divorce he suggests a constitutional amendment, and says it is not safe to leave these ques tions to be dealt with by the various states. Continuing on this subject he says: When home ties are loosened: when men and women cease to regard a worthy family lire, with all its duties fully performed, and all its responsi bilities lived up to. as the life best worth living; then evil days for the commonwealth are at hand. There are regions in our land, and classes of our population, where the birth rate has sunk below the death rate. Surely it should need no demonstration to show that wilful sterility is, from the standpoint of the nation, from me standpoint of the human race, the one sin for which the penalty is national death, race death; a sin for which there is no atonement; a sin which ts the more dreadful exactly in propor tion as the men and women guilty thereof are In other respects. In char acter, and bodily and mental powers, those whom for the sake of the state it would be well to see the fathers and mothers of many healthy children, well brought up in homes made happy by their presence. No man, no woman, can shirk the primary duties of life, whether for love of ease and pleasure, or for any other cause, and retain his or her self-respect. The president asks for the enactment Into law of a shipping bill that will place American Interests on the seas on a par with those of other countries, and urges especially that something be done that will establish direct steamship commu nication with South American ports. Currency Reform. Amendments to the present currency laws are asked for, and after showing that present laws are inadequate because of the wide fluctuation of interest charges, he says: "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system ts seri ously defective. There is ned of a change. Unfortunately, however, manv of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are complicated, are not easy of compre hension, and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out any plan which would ma terially impair the value of the L'nited States two per cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, the issue of which was made under conditions pe culiarly creditable to the treasury. I do not press any special plan. Various plans have recently been proposed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possibly feasible and which certainly should receive your consideration is that repeatedly brought to your attention by the pres ent secretary of the treasury, the es sential features of which have been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this plan national banks should be per mitted to issue a specified proportion of their capital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the nates back when not wanted in legitimate trade. This plan would not permit the issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emergency pre sented by times of stringency. He again asks for free trade with this country for the Philippines and in the same connection reviews the work done by this country in the islands, and says "If we have erred In the Philippines It has been in proceeding too rapidly In the direction of granting a large meas ure of self-government." Naturalization of Japs. President Roosevelt scores San Fran cisco and other Pacific coast cities for their treatment of the Japanese, and makes the following recommendations: "I recommend to the congress that an act be passed specifically provding for the naturalization of Japanese who come here intending to become American cit izens. One of the great embarrassments attending the performance of our in ternational obligations is the fact that the statutes of the United States gov ernment are entirely Inadequate. They fail to give to the national government sufficiently ample power, through United States courts and by the use of the army and navy, to protect aliens In the rights secured to them under solemn treaties which are the law of the land. I therefore earnestly recommend that the criminal and civil statutes of the United States be so amended and ad-led to as to enable the president, acting for the United States government, which is responsible in our international rela tions, to enforce the rights of aliens un der treaties. Even as the law now is something can be done by the federal government toward this end. and in the matter now before me affecting the Jap anese, everything that it is in my power to do will be done, and all of the forces, military and civil, of the United States which I may lawfully employ will be so employed. There should, however, be no particle of doubt as to the power of the national government completely to perform and enforce its own obligations to other nations. The mob of a single city may at any time perform acts of lawless violence against some class of foreigners which would plunge us into war. The city by Itself would be power less to make defense against the for eign power thus assaulted, and if Inde pendent of this government it would never venture to perform or permit the performance of the acts complained of. The entire power and the whole duty to protect the offending city or the offend ing community lies in the hands of the ! United States government. It is un thinkable that we should continue a pol icy under which a given locality may be allowed to commit a crime against a friendly nation, and the United States government limited, not to preventing the commission of the crime, but. in the last resort, to defending the people who have committed It against the conse quences of their own wrongdoing." American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico. The harbor of San Juan in Porto Riro should be dredged anvl improved. The expenses of the federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. The administration of the af fairs of Porto Rico, together with those of the Philippines. Hawaii and our other insular possessions, should all be direct ed under one executive department: by preference the department of state or the department of war. Cuban Intervention. The rebellion in Cuba and the inci dents leading up to the establishment cf the provisional government is reviewed, and the president says: "When the election has been held and the new government Inaugurated in peaceful and orderly fashion of the provi sional government will come to an end. I take this opportunity of expressing upon behalf of the American people, with all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will realize the imperative need of pre serving justice and keeping order in the island. The United States wishes noth ing of Cuba except that it shall prosper morally and materially, and wishes noth ing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to preserve order among them selves and therefore to preserve their independence. If the elections become a farce, and if the insurrectionary habit becomes confirmed in the island, it Is ab solutely out of the question that the Island should continue Independent; and the United States, which has assumed the sporsorship before the civilized world for Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to intervene and to see that the government was managed In such orderly fashion as to secure the safety of life and property. The path to be trodden by those who exercise self-government is always hard, and we should have every charity and patience with the Cubans as they tread this difficult parth. I have the utmost sympathy with, and regard for, them; but I most earnestly adjure them solemnly to weigh their re sponsibilities and to see that when their new government is started it Bhall run smoothly, and with freedom from fla grant, denial of right on the one hand, and from insurrectionary disturbances on the other." On the subject of the Panama canal he promises a special message in the near future. Considerable space is devoted to the international conference of American re publics and the visit of Secretary Root to South America, and points to the fact that our efforts in behalf of TSie nations of that country are appreciated by them. It 

CONGRESS PASSAGE OF APPROPRIATION BILLS AND LITTLE OTHER LEGISLATION. A BILLION DOLLAR BODY The Ship Subsidy Bill May Be Brought to the Front, and Currency and the Tariff Discussed The Smoot Case. Washington The passage of the appropriation bills and as little other general legislation as possible. Such in brief is the forecast for tha short session of the Fifty-ninth congress, it is evident that for various reasons It will not be possible to do much on the appropriation bills before the holidays and this circumstance wil practically have the effect of con densing the consideration of the 14 large supply measures into two months. Considering that the aggre gate of the appropriations to be will approximate one billion dollars, some senators and members express the opinion that congress cannot do bet ter than give all of its time to these measures. The Ship Subsidy Bill. The ship subsidy bill probably will be an exception to the rule for no general legislation. The friends of that measure have never been more insistent than now. They are extreme ly hopeful and yet very apprehensive. The bill has passed the senate and is In committee in the house. The committee has heretofore been quite evenly divided, but the advocat.s of the bill believe that they will be able to get it out in due season, and they hope for It3 consideration when once reported to the house. One incident that is very materially helping the subsidy is the recent speech of Secre tary Root in support of it. Currency and Inheritance Tax. Not a few members of both houses are anxious to meet the demands of the bankers and others for a more elastic currency, and it is quite cer tain that there will be efforts to sup ply this want, but there are so many plans that even the most sincere be lievers in the necessity almost despair cf accomplishing anything in that dt rection during a short session. The recommendations of tha presid?nt in the interest of a national inheritance tax is awaited with eager interest by many, and there is no doubt that a large following could be secured for a measure of the character he will out line. The Tariff and Other Questions. Among the questions slattd for a liberal share of discussion, the tariff stands at the head of ths list, bu"; no one has the least idea that any seri ous effort will now be made to secure the modifications which even many republicans think desirable. The pres ident, who himself desires some changes, has recently promised his congressional callers that he will not ask to have the subject taken up at this time. The Japanese question, the discharge of the negro soldiers, the desirability of an income tax law, the result of the late eleclins an i the trusts are also slated for d'scuision. Senator Smoot's Case. The senate will give at:ention to the case 'of Senator Reed Smoot. but what it will do about it not even the senate wishes now to contemplate. There has from the first b en a dis position to put the Smoot matter aside, but with the report of the com mittee on privileges and elections oa the calendar, and Chairman Burrows quite determined to press considera tion, the fact that the matter must be dealt with is beginning to impress itself upon members, and they are preparing seriously for its considera tion. The Michigan senator will set the ball rolling Monday, the 10th inst The Panama Canal. Much interest attaches to the presi dent's forthcoming recommendations concerning the Panama canal, espe cially because of his recent visit to the canal zone. It is not expected that he will ask much legislation be yond the necessary appropriations, and there is a general dispisitin to grant these. The increase of the navy will receive much consideration, but there is still opposition to the proposed ship of the Dreadnaught class.

JAPAN AND AMERICA LONDON MAIL SAYS JAPAN WILL NOT ENFORCE RIGHTS. FRISCO INCIDENT WILL PASS Yet Sooner or Later, Paper Declares, Westerners Must Recognize Asiatic Equality. London The Daily Mall publishes an editorial on the difficulties of the United States with Japan over the school question in San Francisco. The paper is of the opinion that In spite of the gravity of the situation, owing to the fact that President Roosevelt has not power to coerce California, It is foolish to suggest that Japan would enforce her rights at the cannon's mouth.

SENATOR FORAKER EXPLAINS. His Resolution of Inquiry, He Says, Speaks for Itself. Washington Senator Foraker ex plained the purposes of his resolution of inquiry in regard to the discharge of negro soldiers from the Twenty fifth infantry in the following inter view: "The resolution speaks for Itself. I cannot discuss it. I will say, however, I have no purpose of raising the race question. The question involved is broader. It would be unfortunate to have it narrowed down by drawing the color line. It concerns white as well as colored soldiers. It is a question of constitutional power on the one hand and constitutional and statutory rights on the other. Until we have a complete record, I do not know just what question will arise; but we may have to consider whether a man can be convicted of felony by order, and whether following such a conviction, sentence may be imposed and punish ment inflicted by order. Discharges without honor may be granted where they are cot based on an offense against the law of the land the com mission of which is denied, and where no punishment follows. But where there is conviction, sentence and pun ishment, I have always supposed that there would have to be also trial."' NEW ISLE OF PINES TREATY.
