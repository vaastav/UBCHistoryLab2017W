' The disposition to re- fuse a prompt and hearty obedience to ' the eoual riehts amendments to the con atltution, is all that now stands in the way of a com Diets obliteration of section al lines in our political contests.

This determination pro ceeds irom no hostile sentiment or leei- try. or to any of their interests. The in violability of the amendments rests upon the fundamental principle of our gov ernment. They are the solemn expres sion of the will of the people of the Unit- ed States. The sentiment that the constitutional rights of our citizens must be maintained does not grow weaker. It will continue, to control the government of the country. Happily the history of the late election shows that in many parts of the country wnere oppusiuuu w w uunutu imsuu ment has heretofore prevailed, it is di minishing, and is likely to cease alto gether, if firm and well-considered action La taken by congress. I trust the house of representatives and the senate, which have the right to judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members, wiu see to It that every case of violation of the letter or spirit of the fif teenth amendment is thoroughly invest!- Bted, and that no benefit from such vlo Lion shall accrue to any person or par ty. It will be the duty of the executive, with sufficient appropriations for the urpose,to prosecute unsparingly all who ave been engaged in depriving citizens of the tights guaranteed to them by the constitution. ' eOVKRNMEKTAt AID TO EDUCATION. It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest guaraniee 01 tne prim ary rights of citizenship is to be found in that caoaclty for seir protection wnicn - can belong only to a people whose right to universal sunrsge is supported dj un- lTeraau ouucnuuut wnu, tus command of the local and state authori ties are, in many cases, wholly inade quate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true, where, before, emancipation, the educa tion of the people was neglected or pre - Vented, in the interest of slavery. Flrm . ly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest attention ' ot the people Of the whole country, with v view to wise and comprehensive action bv the government of the United States. , I respectfully recommend thatcongress by ; suitable legislation and with proper safe guards, supplement the local educational junds in the several states where the grave duties and responsibilities of citi senshlp have been devolved upon unedu - cat ed people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the publlo lands, and If, necess ary, by appropriations from the treasury ment can iairiy uo to promote iree popu . lar education ought to be done. Wher - ever general education is found, peace. virtue an d social order prevail, and civil and roligious liberty are secure. , . ' CIVIX. SEBVICS BEVOBM.' In ray former annual messages X have ' asked the attention of congress to the ur gent necessity of a reform stlon of the civil service system of the govern Trent. My views concerning' the dangers' of pat ronage or appointments for personal or partisan considerations hve been string . thened by my. observation and experience , in the executive office and I believe '.these dangers threaten the stability of - the government. Abuses ao serious In ; their nature cannotjbe permanently toler a ted. They iend to become mote, alarm - lfltr with the enlargement of admlntstra ttve ervlce, as the growth ot tho country in nonn1atlnn"lncTAasa tha nnnthur t1 rr- v y r- officers and placemen employed. The reasons sre , imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appointments, promotions and re mo r H, establishing uniform method, hav ing exclusively, in view, in every in stance, the attainment of the best quali fications or i the posiftlon in question. Such method alone is consistent with the eaual risrhts ot all citizens, and the most eonomVcal and efficient adminis tration of the publlo business. Competitive-examinations, In aid of Impartial appointments and promotions, have been conducted for some years past in ve verai or tne executive departments, and by my direction thla system has been adopted In the custom houses and poatofficesof the larger cities of the coun try. In the city ot New York over 2,000 nl 1 .v. .1.11 Km . pVBlhtUIia HI

Tbereaults of these practical trials have been very satisfactory, and hsve confirmed my -opinion in fsvor of this system ot 'selection. All are sub jected co the same tests, and the result is XreefJpni preludlce by personal favor or -partisan Influence, It secures fof the txtoltiOn, applied Tor tne pest quninca- f(loant. It is an effectual- protection roan the pressure of importunity which, under any other course pursued, -largely ftxscta the Cme and attention of appoint ing officers, to thair great detriment In the discharge of other official duties, f preventing the abuse or the service for he mere furtherance of private or parly purposes, and leaving the employe of the government, rreed irom tne oDiigatioia im potted by patronage, to depend solely upon merit for retention aud advance ment, and with this oonstant incentive to exertion and improvement. These invaluable results have been at tained in a high degree in the offices where the rule for appointment by com petitive examination nave been applied A method which has so approved It self by experimental tests at points where such tests msy be fairly consider ed conclusive, should be extended to all subordinate positions under the govern ment. I believe that a strong and grow iBg publlo sentiment demands Immediate measures tor securing ana eniorcing tne highest possible efficiency in the civil service, and its protection from recogniz ed abuses, and mat tne experience reier red to has demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations In the custom houses and postofflces have been held under mmv Amhsjrasanienta and without pro vision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the officers wno nave nonduoted them, and whose commenda ble Interest in tne improvement 01 tue mibJio service has Induced this devotion of time and labor without pecuniary re ward. A continuance of these laoors ffiatultouslvoucbtnot to be expected aud without an appropriation Dy congress ior compensation, it la not practicaDie to ex tend tbe svstem or examinations gener all v throu shout the civil service It is . ui niarmv imnnruni inu ail i mien mx . j - . .- . . , . , aminatlons anouid do conuueteu upon a uniform system and under general super vision. Section 1753 of the revised statutes authorizes the President to pre scribe the regulations for admlssiou to the civil service of the united states, ana for this purpose to employ suitable per sons to conduct the requisite inquiries with reference to ''the ntness or eacn candidate in respect to age, health, char acter, knowledge and ability for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter;" but the law Is practically luoo eratlve for want of the requisite appro nriatlon ' I therefore recommend an sppropila tion of $25,000 per annum to meet the ex- Eenses of commission, to do appoimeu y the President in accordance with the terms ol this section, whose duty it shall be to devise a Just, uniform and efficient system of competitive examinations, ana to supervise the application of the same throughout tne euure civu service 01 tue government. I am persuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for testing the fitness of those who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of congress as it will be to the President and heads of HonnrtmnntM. but that It will also frreatlv tend to remove the causes of embarass- ment which now inevitably and con stantly attend the conflicting claims ol patronage between the legislative and executive departments. The most effect uaicbeck uoon tne pernicious com pen tlon of Influence and official favoritism in the bestowal of office, will be the sub stltution ofan open competition ot merit between tne applicants, in wnicn every ore can make his own record with the assurance that his success will depend upon this alone, 1' also recommend such legislation as, while leaving every officer as free as any other citizen to express his political opm ion, and to use his means for their ad vancement. shall also enable him to feel as safe as any private citizen in refusing all demands upon his salary tor political purposes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and Justice to all who are engaged in the public service, and likewise contain stringent provisions ssalnst the use or official authority to co erse the political action of private citizens or of official subo-dlnatos, is greatly to be desired. The most serious obstacle, however, to an improvement of the civil service, and especially to a reform in the method of appointment and removal has been fouud to bo the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, by wbicn tne ap poiniiocr power has been so largely en croacbed upon by members of congress, The first step In the reform of the civil service must be a complete divorce be tween congress and the executive in tho matter of appointments. The corrupting doctrine that ''to the victors belong the SDolle." is inscperable from contrresslon al patronage as the established rule and practice of parties In power. It comes to be understood by applicants for office, and bv the people uenerally, that repre sentatives and senators are entitled to disburse the patronage of their respective districts and states. It is "not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this invasion of the executive functions. The true principles of government in the national conventions or tne leaaing par ties of the country, hsve again end sgain been spproved by the American people, and have not been called In question In any quarter. These authentlo ex presslons of public opinion upon this all important sublect are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure of the government. "Under the constitution the President and heads of departments are to make nominations for office. The senate Is to advise and consent to appointments, and the house of representatives Is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. The best Interest in the publlo service demands that these distinctions bo respected; that senators and representatives, who may be Judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office." To this end the co-operation nf the legislative depart ment of the government is required, alike by the necessities of the rase and by pub llo opinion. Members of congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with reference to appoint ments to omce until, Dy legislative en actment, the pernicious practice Is con' demned and forbidden. - It is therefore recommended (hat an act be Dassed defining the relations of, mem bers of congress with respect to appoint ment to office by the Presldent.ana I also recommend that the provisions of section 1757. and of the sections following, of the Ravised Statutes, comprising the tenure of office act of March 2, 1867. be repealed. Believing that to reform the system and methods of the civil service in our coun try is one of the highest and most imper atlve duties of statesmanship, and that it can be permanently done only by the co-operation or the legislative ana execu tive departments of the government, I strain commend the whole subject to your considerate attention. 

FOLTOAMT ' It is the recognized duty and purpose of the people or tne united states to sup press polygamy where It now exists in our territories, and to prevent its exten sion. Faithful and zealous efforts hsve been made by the United States authori ties in Utah to enforce the lews against It. Exnerience has shown that the legis lation uoon this subject, to be (fftctlve. rennlres extensive modification and amendment. The longer action is delay ed, the more difficult it will be to accom ni anwnat is aesireu. rromp. ana a elded measures are necessary. The Mormon sectarian organization which upholds polygamy haa the whole power or making and executing the local legis lation of the territory. By Its control of the grand and petit juries, it possesses large influence over the administration of Justloe. Exercising, as the heads of this sect do, the local political power of the territory, they are able to make ef fective their hostility to the law of con gress on the subject of polygamy, snd, in fact, do prevent - its enforcement. Polygamy will not . be abolished if the enforcement ot the law de- Kndsupon those who practice and up Id the crime. It can only be suppressed by taking away the political power of the sect which encourages and austains it. The power or congress to enact suitable laws to protect the territory is ample. It is not a case for half-way measures. - The Klltlcsl power of theMormon sect Is ;reasing; It controls new one of oar wealthiest and most populous territories. It Is extending steaditr into other terri tories. Wherever It goes.lt establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and the family relation are . the corner stone 0 our American society and civilization. He Ifglous liberty and the nepara ion of church and state are among the elemen tary ideas of free Institutions. To re establish the Interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonism have imperilled, and to fully reopen to Intelli gent and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain, whleh has been. In a great degree, closed to f;eneral immigration by Intolerant and mmotal institutions, it is recommended that the government or the territory of Utah be reorganized. I recommend thatcongress provide for the rovernment ef Utah by a governor and judges, or opmmltaloners. appointed y the President and con Aimed by the senate a government analogoua to the utovit-lonal government established ror the territory northwest of Ohio, by the ordinance of 1767. If, however, it is deeuuul best to oontluue the existing form of local government. I recommend that the right to vote, hold office, and ait on Juries In the territory of Utah, bacon- nned to those woo neitner practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough meas ures sre adopted, It is believed that with in a few yeara the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradicated, and that thla territory will In good time become oneot the most prosperous and attractive ot the new states 01 the Union. RELATIONS WITH GREAT BRITAIN Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed poace, and have presented no occasion for con cern as to their continued maintenance. My anticipation of an early reply from the British government to the demand of indemnity to our fishermen for the in I Dr ies sufiered by that Industry at Fortune bay, in January, 1878. wuicn I expressed In my last annual message, waa disap pointed, 'inia answer was received only n mo isuer part or April in tne present year, ana, wnen received, ex molted a failure of accord between the two govern ments as to ine measure or tne inshore fishing privilege securod to our fisher men by the treaty ot Washington, of so serious a character that I made it the sub ject of a communication to congress, in wnicn 1 reoommenaeu ine adoption or the measures which seemed to me proper to ue lauen oy mis government in main tenance of the rights accorded to our fishermen under the treaty, and toward securing an indemnity lor the injury these lctereits nau suuerea. a Dili to carry out these - recommendations was under consideration oy me Douse or rep resent atlves at the time of the adjourn ment of congress in June last. within a lew weeks x nave received a communication from her majesty's gov ernment, renewing tho consideration of the subject, both of the indemnity for the injuries at Fortune bay, and of the interpretation of the treaty in which the previous correspondence had shown the two governments to be at variance. Upon both these topics the disposition towards a friendly agreement is manifes ted by a recognition of our right to an in demnity for the transaction at Fortune bay. leaving the measure of such Indem nity to further conference, and by an assent to the view of this government, presented in thj rrevlou correspon dence, that the regulation of cov.fllcilng interests of the shore fishery of the prov incial seacoasts, and the vessel fishery of our nsnermen, should he made the subject of conference and concurrent ar rangemont between the two govern ments. I sincerely hone that the basis may be found for a speedy adjustment of the very serious divergence of views iu the interpretation of the fishery clauses ot the treaty of Washington, which, as the correspondence between tne two govern ments stood at the close of the last session of congress, seemed to be irreconcilable 

GENERAL FOREIGN RELATIONS. In the important exhibition of arts and indusiiiea, which was held last year at Sydney, New boutn waies, as wen as in that now iu progress at Melbourne, the United States have been efficiently and honorably represented. The exhibitors from this country at the former place re celved a large number of awards in some of the most considerable departments and the participation of 1 he United States was recognized by a special mark or dlS' tinction. In the exhibition at Melbourne, the share taken by our country is nolens notable, and an tqual degree of success is confidently expected. The stite ot peace and tranquility now enjoyed hy all the nations or the conti ueut ot Europe has its favorable itflu ence upon our diplomatic and commerc ial relations with them, we have con eluded and ratified a convention with tho Frenoh republic for the settlement of claims or the citizens or eitner. country against the other. Under this convention a com mission, me.sided over hvadla tintruished publicist, appointed in our suanoe of the request of both nations, by his malcsty the Emperor of Brazil, has begun its sessions in this city. A con gress to consider means for the protec tion or industrial property has recently been in sebslou at Paris, to which I have appointed the ministers or the united States in France and in Belgium as dele gates, xne intei national commission upon weights and measures slso contln ues its work In Paris. 1 invite your at tention to the necessity of an appropria tion to be made in time to enable tbi government to comply with its obliga tions under tne metrical convention, Our friendly relations with the German empire cotitiuue without interruption. At the rocent international exhibition of fish and fisheries at Berlin, the partici pation oitlie United States. notw?thstaud ing the haste with which the commission was forced to mako its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious. winning for private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class, and for the coun try at large the principle prize of honor offered by his majesty the emperor. The results of this great success cannot but be advantageous to this Important and grow lng Industry. There have been some questions raided between the two govern ments as to the proper effect and Inter pretation of our treaties of naturalization. but recent dispatches from our minister at Berlin show that favorable progress! making toward an understanding, In ao cordance with the views of this govern' ment, which makes and admits no dis tinction whatever between the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen or the United Slates. In practice, the complaints of molestation suffered by naturalized citizens abroad have never been fewer than at present. There is nothing of Importance to note in our unbroken friendly relations with the governments or Austria-Hungary Russia, Portugal. Sweden and Norway, Switzerland. Turkey and Greece. During the last summer several vessels belonging to the merchant marine of this country, saillngjln neutral waters of the West Indies, were fired at, boarded, and searched by an armed cruiser of the Hpan lsh Government. The circumstances, as reported, luvolve not only a private in- Jury to the persons concerned, but also seemed a little observant of the friendly relations exlstlog between this country and Spain. The wrong was brought to the attention of the Spanish Government In a serious protest and remonstrance, and the matter is undergoing investiga tion by the royal authorities, with a view to such explanation or reparation as may be called for by the facts. The commission sitting In this city for the adjudication of claims of our citizens against ine government ot Spain is, I hope, approaching the termination of its labors. The claims sgainst the United States under the Florida treaty with Spain were submitted to congrof s for Its action at the late session, and I again invite your at tention to this . long-standing question, with a view to a final disposition of the matter. At the invitation of the Spanish gov ernment, a conference has recently been held at the city of Madrid to consider the subject of protection by foreign powers of native Moors In the empire of Moroo co. The minister ol tho Upited States, In Spain, was directed to take part In the de liberations of this conference, the result of which is a convention togned on be half ot all the powers represented. The Instrument will be laid before the senate for Its consideration. The government of the United States has also lost no op portunity to urge upon that of the empe ror of Morocco the necessity, In accord ance v? 1th the humane and enlightened spirit of the age. ot putting an end to the Krsecutions, which have been so preva lt in that country, of persons of faith other tbsn the Moslem, and especially of the Hebrew residents of Morrooco. The oonsular treaty concluded with Belgium has not yet been officially pro mulgated, owing to the alteration of a word in the text by the senate of the United States, which occasioned a delay, during which the time allowed for ratifi cation expired. The Senato will be asked to extend the period for ratification. . The attempt to negotiate a treaty of ex tradition with Denmark failed on ac count of the objection of the Danish gov ernment to the usual clause providing that each nation should pay the expense of the arrest of the persons whose extra dition tt asks. THB CniflESB TB BATIKS. The provision made by congress, at Its last session, for the expense of the com mlslon which bad been appointed to en ter upon negotiations with the imperial foverument of China, on subjects of great nterest to the relations of the two coun tries, enabled the com mission era to pro ceed at onoe upon their com tn 1m Ion. The Imperial government waa prepared to give prompt and respectful attention to the matters brought under negotiations. and the conference proceeded with such rapidity and nieces that, on the 17 lu 01 November last, two treaties were signed at Pekin, one relating to the introduction of Cblneae into this oountry and one relating to commerce. Mr. Treacot, one of the commissioner, is now on his way home bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they will bo received in aeason to be laid before the aeuate early In January. MINOR FOREIGN MATTERS. Our minister in Japan haa negotiated a convention for the reciprocal relief of ahlp wrecked seamen. I tske occasion to urge once more upon congress the pro- Etrlety of making provision fortbeereo iou of suitable tire-proof buildings at the Japanese capital for t he uae of the Ameri can legation, and the court house and Jail connected with it. The J apaneae govern- ment.witb great generosity and courtesy. has offored for this purpose an eligible piece of land. In my laat message I Invited the atten tion of congress 10 the subject of the indemnity funds received some yeara ago from uhina and Japan. 1 renew the recommendation then made, that what ever portions of these fuuds are due to Americau citizens should be promptly paia, ana tne resiaue returned to me nations, resoeotivelv. to which thev luat- ly and equitably belong. Tne extradition treaty with the king dom of the Netherlands, whloh has been for some time in course of negotiation. has, during the past year, been concluded and duly ratified. Kelationa of friendship and amity have Deen established between the govern ment of the United States and that of Roumanla. We have sent a diplomatic le present at! ye to Bucharest, and have received at this capital the special envoy, wno nas been cnargeu by nis royal high ness, Prince Charles, to announce the Independent sovereignty of Koumania. We hope lor a speedy development of commercial relations between tne two countries. In my last annual message Iexpresaod the hope that the prevalence olquluton the border between thla (ouniry and Mexico would soon become so assured as to Justify the modification of the orders men in iorceto our military commander, iu regara 10 crossing tne frontier, witn out encouraging men disturbances s would endanger the peace of the two countries. Events moved In accordance with these expectations, and the orders were accordingly wlthdrawn.to the entire satisfaction of our own citizens and the Mexican government. Subsequently the peace or tne border was again dls turbed by a savage foray, uuder the command of the Chief Victorio, but by the combined and harmonious action of the military forces of both countries, his band nas been broken up and tubs tan tially destroyed. There is reason to believe that the obstacles which have so long prevented rapid and convenient communication between the United States and Mexico by railways, are on the point of disappearing. and that several important enterprises of this character will soon be set on foot which cannot fail to contribute largely to inn prosperity or botn countries. New envoys from Guatemala. Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela and Nlcarauga have lecently arrived at this capital, whose distinction and enlightenment sfford the best guarantee of the continuance of friendly relations between ourselvet and theso sister republics. THE 

PANAMA CANAL. The relations between this government and that of the United States of Colombia have engaged public attention during the past year, mainly by reason of the project of an Interooeaulo canal across the isth mus of Pauama, to be built by private capital under a concession from the Colombian government tor that purpose. ine treaty obligations subsisting be tween the United States and Colombia, by which we guarantee I ho neutrality 01 mo transit and tne sovereignty and prop erty of Colombia in the isthmus, make it necessary that the conditions under which so stupendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effdoted transferring, as it would. this isthmus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Into a gate way and thoroughfare between them, tor the natives, and the merchant a hi pa of the world should receive the approval ot this government, as being compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our Interests as the principal commercial power of the western hemisphere. The views which I expressed in a special message to congress in March last, - in relation to this project, 1 deem it my duty to press upon your attention, sub sequent consideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it Is the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain sucn supervision and authority over any Interoreaniu canal across the Isthmus that connects North and South America as wlii protect our national interest." OTHER MINOR FOREIGN TOPICS. The war between the republic of Chili on the one hand, and the allied republics of Peru and Bolivia on the other, stl.l continues. This government has not felt called upon te interfere in a contest that is within the belligerent rights of the parties as Independent states. W e have however, always held ourselves In readl ness to aid In accommodating their diff erence, and have at different times re minded both belligerents of our willing ness to render such service. Our good offices. In this direction, were recently accepted by all the belligerents, and It was hoped they would prove effi cacious; but I regret to announce that the measures, which the ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with a view to bring about a peace, were not successful. In the course of the warworn e'questlons have arlsn effecting neutral rights; in all of these the ministers of.the United States have, under their instructions, acted with promptness and energy in protection of American Interests. The relations of the United States with the empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, and their commercial Intercourse steadily Increases, to their mutual ad vantage. The Internal disorders with which the Argentine republic has tor sometime past been afflicted, and which have more or less influenced its external trade, are understood to nave been brought to a close. Tnis nsppy result may be expect ed to redound to the benefit ot the foreign oommerco of the republic as well as to the developement of its vast interior resources. In Samoa, the government of King Malletoa, under the support and recog nition of the consular representatives of the united states, ureat Britain 'and Germany, seems to have given peace and tranquilly to the islands. While it doea not appear desirable to adopt as a whole the scheme of tripartite local govern ment, which has been proposed, the common Interests of the three great treaty powers require harmony in their rela tions to the native frame of government, and this may be best secured by a simple diplomatic agreement between them. It would be well if the consular Jurisdiction of our representative at Apia were in creased In extent and importance so as to guard American interest! In the surrounding and outlying Islands of Oceanloa The obelisk, generously presented by the khedive of Egypt to the city of New York, hss safely arrived In this oountry, and will aoon be erected in that metropo lis. A commission for the liquidation of the Egyptian debt has lately concluded ita work, and the government, at the earnest solicitation of the khedive, has acceded to the provisions adopted by it, which will be laid before congress for Its information. A commission for the re vision of the Judicial code of the reform tribunal of Eypt is now In session in Cairo Mr. Farman. oonsul general, and J. M. Batchelder, E q., have been ap- Interest In these efforts, as developed In ' our commercial com munition, and the value of tue information secured by thla means, to the trade and manufactures of the oountry, werereoognlzed by oongres at ita last sessloo.snd provision waa made for tne more rrequent publication or oon sular and other reports by the depart ment 01 state, ine nrst issue 01 tuis publication has now been prepared and subsequent issues may regularly be expeoted. The importance and interest attached to the reports of consular officers are witnessed by the general demand for them by an classes or merchants and manufacturers engaged in our foreign trade. It is believed that the vystem of such publications Is deserving of the ap proval of con nress, and that the neces sary appropriations for Its continuance and enlargement wiu commend itself to your consideration. GOVERN BENT AID TO TORSION COMMERCE. The prosperous energies of our domestic in dustries, and their Immense production of the subjects ot foreign commerce, Invite, and even require, an active development ol the wishes and interests ot our people in that direc tion. Especially Important la It that our commercial relations with the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and Gulf of Mexico should be direct, ana not tnrougn tne circuit or European ays terns, and should be carried on lu our ewn bot toms. The full appreciation of the opportuni ties which our front on the Pacific ocean gives to commerce witn japan, L'hina, and the least Indies, with Australia and the island groups which lie along these routes of navigation, should Inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, a due proportion ot this trade- whatever modifications or our regulations of trade and navigation may be necessary or use ful to meet and direct these Impulses to the enlargement of our exchanges snd ot our car rying trade. I am sure the wisdom of congress will te reaay to auppiy. une initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to press It uoon your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular ateam postal com munication, dj aia rroin tne government, has been the forerunner of the commercial ore- dominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share In whose trade la now the desire and the Intent ot our people. It is also manifest that the efforts of other Euro pean nations to contend with Great Britain for a ahare of thla commerce have been successful In proportion with their adoption of regular steam postal conimunlcatien with the markets whose trade they sought Mexico and the states of South America are anxious to re ceive such postal communications with this country, and to aid in their development. Sim liar co-operation may be looked for, la due time, from the eastern nations and from Aus tralia, it is dllUcult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private inter ests. In respect of foreign commerce, quite as much as in internal trade, postal communica tion seems necessarily a matter of common and public administration, and thus pertaining to government I respectfully recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development or our foreign commercial exchanges and the Duuaing up 01 our carrying trade. In this connection I desire also to suggest the very great service which might be expect ed in enlarging and facilitating our commerce on the Pacific ocean, were a transmarine cable laid from sau Francisco to the Sandwich is lands, and thence to Japan at the north and Australia at the south. The great Influence of sucn means or communication on these routes of navigation, In developing and securing the due share of our Pacific coast in the commerce of the world, needs no Illustration or enforce ment It may be that such an enterprise, use ful and in the end profitable as it would prove to private investment, may need to be acceler ated by prudent legislation by congress in Its aid, and 1 submit the matter to your careful consideration. An additional, and not unimportant, although seconsary, reason ior restoring ana enlarging the navy may be found in the unquestionable service to tne expansion or our commerce, which would be rendered by the freouent cir culation of naval ships In the seas and ports of all quarters of the globe. Ships of the proper construction ana equipment to ue or tne great' est efficiency in case of maritime war lultrht be made constant and active agents in time of peace iu the advancement and protection of our foreign trade, and In the nurture and dis cipline of young seamen who would naturally, in some numbers, mix with and improve the crews of our merchant ships. Our merchants at home and abroad recognize the value to for eign commerce of an active movement of our naval vessels, ana the intelligence and patriot ic zeal of our naval officers in promoting every interest in their countrymen is a Just subject or national pnae. THB FINANCES. The condition of the financial affairs of the government as shown by the report of the sec retary of the treasury, la very satisfactory.

In pursuance of the act passed at the last sepsioft of congress, invitations have been extended to foreign maritime states tojolain a sanitary conference In Wash ington, beginning the first of January, The acceptance of this Invitation by many prominent powers gives promise of success in this important measure, de signed to establish a system of interna tional notification by which the spread of Infections or epidemic diseases msy be more effectively checked or prevented. The attention of congress Is invited to the necessary appropriations for carrying into effect the provisions of the act refer red to. The efforts of the department of state to enlarge the trade and commeroe ef the United States, through the active agency of consular offioers and through the dissemination of information obtained from them, have been unrelaxed.

There was spoiled thereto the sum ot 973,904,617 41, being 935, 072,973 86 In excess of the actual requirements for the year. The aggregate of the revenues from sll sources during the fiscal year ended June 80, 1880, waa 9333,526,610 98, an Increase over the receding year of 959,699,426 52. The receipts bus far, of the current year, together with the estimated receipts for the remainder of the year, amount to 9350,000,000, which will be sufficient to meet the estimated expenditures of the year, and leave a aurplua of 990,000,000. It is fortunate that this large aurplua revenue occurs at a period when It may be directly ap- Elled to the payment of the puolle debt aoon to s redeemable. Ho more public duty has been more constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the nation's debt as rapidly aa possible. The debt of tha United States, less rash In the treasury and exclusive of accruing interest attained Its maximum of 92,756,431371 43 ln August 1865, and hss sines that time been re duced to 186,019,504 65. Of the principal of the debt (108,758,100 haa been paid since Lurch :, 1877, ejecting an Annual aanng or in terest of 96,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale ot bonds bearing a low rate of interest and the applica tion of the proceeds to the redemption ot bonds bearing a higher rate. The annual sav ing thuaaecured since March L 1877, is 91V 290,453 50. Within a abort period over 9600,000,000 of five and six per cent bonds will become re deemable. This presents a very favorable op portunity not only to further reduce the prin cipal of the debt but also to reduce the rate of Interest on that which will remain ucpald. I call the attention of congress to the views ex pressed on this subject by the secretary of the treasury in bis annual report ana recommend prompt legislation, to enable the treasury de- Sartment to complete the rerunaing or the ebt which la about to mature. The continuance of specie payment haa not been interrupted or endangered since the date of resumption. It haa contributed greatly to the revival or business snd to our remarkable prosperity. The fears that preceded and ac companied resumption have proved ground less. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums ot gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the mints and exchanged for coin or notes. The In crease of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is estimated at 9227,-899,428. There sre aim in existence, uncancelled, 9346,681,015 of United States legal tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war measure, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the United States was then engaged. The preservation of the na tion's existence required, ln the judgment of congress, an Issue of legal tender paper mouey. That it served well the purpose ror whicn it was created is not questioned, but the employ. ment of the notes as paper money indefinitely. after the accomplishment of the object for which they were provided, was not contem- lated by the framers of the law under which iev were Issued. These notes long since be came like any other pecuniary obligation of the government a debt to be paid, and, when Eaid. to be cancelled as mere evidence or an idebtedness no longer existing. I therefore repeat what was said ln the anoual message of last year, that the retirement from circulation ot United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender iu private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress toward a sore ana stable, currency, which should be accepted, as the policy and duty of the government and the interest and security oi the people. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of sliver dollars. fixing their value and giving them legal tender character, it was believed by many of the sup- porters of the measure that the sliver dollar. which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubt ed as to the probAuuiiy or una result never theiess were wining to give the proposed ex perlment a fair trial, with a view to stop the coinage If experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued to be of less commercial valuo than the stand ard gold dollar. The coinage or stiver dollars under the net referred to began lu March, 1878, and has been continued as reaulred by tho act The aver age rate per mouth to the present time has been 92,276,492. The total amount coined orlor to the first of November last was 972,' 847,750. Of this amount 917,084,450 remain lnthe treasury, and only 925.76&291 are in the hands of the people. A constant effort has been made to keep this currency in circula tion and considerable expense has been necessarily incurred for this purpose, but its return to the treasury Is prompt and sure. Contrary to the confident anticipation ot the friends of the measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the stiver dollar, con taining 41214 grains of silver, has not increas ed. During the-year prior to the passage of the bill authorizing its coinage the market value of the silver which It contained was from 90 to 92 cents, as compared with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average market value of the silver dollar has been'88 It 1 obvious, that the legislation of the last congress la regard toj silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in the value of sll veras a result of that legislation, has failed to produce the effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in re ality, is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that ttiis country wui oe iorcea to ac cent a single metal as the sole legal standard ot value, in circulation, and this a standard of less value than it purports to be worth in the recognized money or the world. The constitution of the United States, sound financial principles, and our best interests, all renulre that the country should have as its legal tender money, both gold and silver coin, of an intrinsic value, ns bullion, equivalent to that winch, upon Its lace, it purports to pos sess. The constitution, in express terms, re cognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal tender money. To banish either of these metals from our currency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange to the disparagement of important interests. The United States produces more silver than any other country, and Is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious met als which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, ln my Judgment contribute to this result It congress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dol lars containing 4iz groins or silver, ana in Its stead will authorize the secretary of the treasury to coin sliver dollars of equivalent value as bullion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will be ln accordance with familiar precedents. Congress, on several occasions, has altered the ratio of value be tween gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance witn the actual ra tlo of value between the two metals. In financial legislation every measure In the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations, has been found by ex ierience to dimmish the rates of interest which debtors. are required to pay, and to increase the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history shows how surely money be comes abundant whenever confidence In the ex-a-t performance of moneyed obligations is es tablished TEE WAB
