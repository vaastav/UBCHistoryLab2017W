CONYERS' ALLEGED CONFESSION "Members of Co. B, 25th Infantry, Implicated in the Shooting Up of the Texas City. 

POINTS IN THE BROWNE REPORT ON BROWNSVILLE ______ Ex-Private Boyd Conyers of Company B, llJth Infantry, now at Monroe, Ga., told WUIIum Lawson, a detective in the employ of Capt. I William G. Baldwin of Roanoke. | Va.. that he and three (or four) other men of the 25th Infantry were the leaders in the Brownsvide raid. This information was obtained at different dut s during the month of June, l'JOS. Conye.rs tried to commit suicide after he found that he had made his statement to a detective, declaring that the other negroes would kill him when it got out. T'ne list of participants given in this report Conyers furnished me personally. 1 believe it is substantially correct, hut with the influences shown to be backing Conyers to adhere to his false testimony given before the Senate committee still being exerted he cannot be relied on to support his own confession until it is thoroughly sus: tained from other sources. The investigation lias been conducted with strict recognition of the advisability of preserving seerecy and with discr-tion. No promises of Immunity were made. The issue has evidently become racial. The colored detectives would be confronted in the smaller towns where these men are living with a demand from colored men for information as to their business. We have located over 130 of these ex-soldiers, and have been in thirty states in quest of Information. The appendices give statements as to the results obtained. They Indicate a general knowledge on the part of the ex-6oldlers that the raid came from Inside the fort, and that the soldiers of Company B were the guilty parties. We earnestly urge that we be permitted to continue the investigation. Several detectives are still In the field, and with'n the coming week a number of affidavits will be forthcoming. The President sent the following special message, with inelosures, to the Senate today: To the Senate: I inclose herewith a letter from the Secretary of War transmitting a report of t?he investigation made by Mr. Herbert J. Browne-, employed by the department in conjunction with Capt. W. G. Baldwin to investigate as far as possible what happened at Brownsville on the l!>th and 14th of August, 1906. The report and documents contain some information of great value and some statements that are obviously worthless, but I submit them in their entirety. This report enables us to fix with tolerable definlteness at least some of the criminals wiho took the lead in the murderous shooting of private citizens at Brownsville. It establishes clearly the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting; but upon this point further record was unnecessary, us the fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting has already been established beyond all possibility of doubt. The investigation has not gone far enough to enable us to determine ail the facts, and we will proceed with it; but it has gone far enough to determine with sufficient accuracy certain facts of enough importance to make it advisable that l place the report beiore you. It appears that almost all the members of Company B must havl been actively concerned in the shooting, either to the extent of being participants or to the extent of virtually encouraging those who were participants. As to Companies C and D, there can be no question that practically every man in them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of the soldiers of B Troop, and possibiy by one or two others in one of tihe other troops. This concealment was Itself a grave offense, which was greatly aggravated by their testifying before the Senate commltfoA lVi.it 1k/v.i i _ mai mcy wtrc ignorant or what they must have known. Nevertheless, it is to be said in partial extenuation that they were probably ?owe<l by threats, made by the more desperate of the men who had actually been engaged in the shooting, as to wnat would happen to any man who failed to proteet ;ht wrongdoers. Moreover, there are circumstances tending to show that these misguided men were encouraged by outsiders to persist in their course of concealment and denial. 1 feel, therefore that the guilt of the men who. after the event, thus shielded the perpetrators o| the wrong by refusing to tell the truth about them, though serious, was in part ciue to the unw.se and improper attitude of others, and that some measure of allowance Should be made for the misconduct In oilier words. I believe we can afforc t? reinstate any of these men who now truthfully tell what has happened, give all the aid they can to iix the resnonsihlt in upon those who are really guilty, and show that they themselves had no guiltj knowledge beforehand and were In nc way implicated in the affair, save by having knowledge of It afterward and failing and refusing to divulge it. I'nder the circumstances. and in view of the length 01 time ihey have been out of the service and their loss of the benefit that woulc have accrued to them by continuous long time service, we can afford to treat tin (Continued on Twelfth 1'age.)

Representative Burton of Ohio, whose political future is interesting many people just n6w. spent some time with President Roosevelt today. Leaving the White House he reiterated former statements as | to his program. "I ant a candidate for i United States senator from Ohio," he declared. "and I am leaving for home tonight to get into the middle of the fray. No. I am not thinking about any other place, but propose to give all my time from now on to working for the senatorship." "Is it true that you contemplate resigning as chairman of the rivers and harbors committee of the House?" I "Well, as I have told you, I am not bothering with anything now but the senatorship.

Mr. Burton declared he had no opinion to express on the proposition that has been put forth to have the election take place in the open legislature, without preliminary caucus by the republicans. This proposition is receiving some support throughout the state, and it is said that Mr. Burton would not be averse to everything taking place in the open. The Ohio machine is now supposed to be wi.ii C. JP. Taft. and it will be able to do considerable work in a caucus that would not take place in the open. *The candidates for the succession to Senator Forakev are Mr. Burton. C. P. Taft. Gov. Harris. Representative Keifer and Harry Daugherty. The fight, however. is conceded to be between Taft and Burton. The belief is pretty general among Ohio people that if Mr. Burton fails of election as senator the Cleveland statesman will be offered a position in the .Taft cabinet either as Secretary of State or Secretary of the Treasury. Sanatn. V?a. 41? "-VI 4 WMWI.V4 auu vuc ^auiuoi. Senator Knox today declined to discuss the gossip connecting his name with the Taft cabinet. From Pittsburg come dispatches announcing that Senator Knox has given leading Pittsburg' republicans who are afflicted tf-ith the buzzing of the senatorial bee to understand that he does pot propose to leave the Senate and has no idea of going into the cabinet, no matter what position he may be offered. The situation, though. is#a delicate one. and Mr. Knox, who was at the White House today, prefers not to refer to it. We does not want to be put in the position of de-' clining something that may not be offered him, but It Is the opinion of his closest friends that no cabinet position could induce him to leave tiie Senate. Senator Knox likes his work in the Senate. He likes the opportunity lie has in vacation period to attend to his private work or enjoy a rest. When in the cabinet, he sefused an offer of a position on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States and to some close friends he is said to have indicated that if he ; siiould fail to return to the Senate lie would go back to private life, which lit left at great loss to himself, giving up a law practice worth over $50,000 a year. Examination of Postmasters. Should a man have to stand an examination in geometry, spelling, literary composition and a few other things to get a fourth-class post offlce paying him $50 k year? Would a man be able to pass a creditable examination in these subjects take a position paying $50 a year? These and similar questions growing out of the recent classification by President Roosevelt of fourth-das* postmasters were discussed at a conference at the White House today, those with the President being Senator Penrose and Repiosentatlve Overstreet, chairmen, respectively, of the Senate and Horn* committees on post offices and post roads, and Postmaster General Meyer. Fourth-class post offices ard those paying less than a year to the postmasters. Over that the office becomes a presidential appointment, is the examination for llfty-dollar offices to be the same as that for nine-hundred-dollar offices? Would the same class of men respond for one as the other?

Congress is not to be asked to aid the administration in solving the problems ' coming up, bat the views of the men at the Capitol familiar with post office operations were asked, so that as much light as possible might be thrown on the subject. The President and the Postmaster General will further thresh oat the questions, probably at the cabinet meeting tomorrow, and will talk further with Chairmen Penrose and G\erstreet. | African Insects Most Dangerous. j President Roosevelt was told today that I ills greatest dangers in Africa will not ! bo from wild beauts or reptiles, from .! which he can defend himself, but from , poisonous insects. He received a call from J. O. Thompson of Richmond. Ind.. . who has spent much time in Africa. Mr. Thompson was introduced by Representa. tlve Rede. [ African insects frequently produce blood nni^Gninif Mr. Thomoson told the I'resi dent. and others bring on what is called the s eeping slekness, not to spent of malaria from mosquitoes. The sleeping slekness is said to result from the sting . of the tse-tse fly. and has baffl'd the ;> vsic'aus qf Africa. It is largely confined , to natives, however. 1 The President asked Mr. Thompson to i rite for him all the information he fett I would be of value on the trip, and Mr. , Thompson will do this.

J ISTRICT BILLS DEBATED reposition to Establish Free Lecture Course Defeated. j ojsuLisa fiUUJUil biiuns i issage of the Bill After Proposed Amendment Had Been Ruled Out on a Point of Order. The House of Representatives, sitting i a board of aldermen of the District of lumbia, today considered a number of Istriet measures. The most important action taken by the j onse up to the time The Star's report osed was the passage of a bill llxlng i annual tax of $UX) on all dealers In garottes and cigarette papers. This oposition was offered by Representative ann of Illinois as an amendment to the mmittee bill, eaMcd up by the chairman nitli, imposing a tax of ?1- a year on 1 dealers handling manufactured to.000 products. Mr. Mann criticised the committee for acing the same tax on cigarettes, or offin nails," as he described them, and her manufactured products. Hisamendent was adopted by practically a unanious vote. The House killed the bill providing for ee lectures in the District by a decided ajority and after a long discussion, irticipated in by Representative Olcott, charge of the bill, and other members the District committee, supported by epresentative Parsons of New York, epresentative Golden of New York and vera! others, and opposed on the floor r Representatives Simms of Tennessee, ann of Illinois and half a dozen more. Other District business was being disissed when The Star's report closed. District Business Delayed. Chairman Smith of the House District mmlttee was on the alert when the ouse of Representatives met at noon to. iy, and after the reading of the journal id been finished he jumped to his feet id endeavored to get the Speaker's eye I call up the first of the District meaa es. But Sereno Payne, the majority ader. was ahead of him with a tnotion lay on the table the democratic ap;al from the decision of the chair, pendg since Saturday. There was a roll call i this motion, which resulted in the ap al being smothered by a vote of 170 to f. So it was fifteen minutes of l o'clock ffore Mr. Smith was recognized to move lat the House go into committee of le whole House on the state of the nion to consider bills on that calendar, he Speaker called Representative Town>nd of Michigan to the chair. Mr. Smith then called up House bill WHO. providing for the payment of an inual license tax of SI- bv dealers in 1 forms of manufactured tobacco in the istriet of Columbia. After the clerk had read the unaniously favorable report of the committee i the measure. Representative Mann of linois, the "great objector," asked why higher tax had not been inforced on the le of cigarettes. "Think of !t," he said. "Here is a pro>sal to charge an additional dollar a onth for the privilege of selling coffin tils." Mr. Mann moved to strike the "cigitte privilege" out of the bill, and a viva . >ce vote ieit some douot as to the relit. Mr. Mann explained that he wanted ' offer an amendment fixing a much glier rate for the .sale of cigarettes. Eleary Tax on Cigarette Dealers.

On the suggestion of a member Mr. ann included cigarette papers in the 00 a year list. Then the vote was taken and the bill issed, Representative Longworth of hio laughingly registering the only nepive vote as he waved his hand at the porters in the press gallery. Mr. Smith then called up House bill ?W>. providing for a disbursing ottlcer r the Government Hospital lor the Inine. across the river. Representative Icott of New York, who had the bill in large, explained t?liat it merely provided r this disbursing officer in question. 1th no additional expense entailed, the eation of the position being designed to; 'sist materially the proper admintstraon of the affairs of the hospital. Representative Johnson of South Carona wanted to know who had been dtslrsing the money up to tills time. Mr. icott explained t.hat this was a part or le superintendent's job. The bill was issed. Proposed Free Lectures. The House then took up the Olcott bill lthorlzlng the board of education to aintain a course of scries of free eveng lectures, some of them to be held some of the public school buildings. 4r. Mann wanted to know how much oney the free lectures would cost and ggested that the bill was nothing but 1 X?g on which to hang a future approbation." In reply to a statement by r. Olcott thftt only a small amount of oney would be needed for the lectures. Mr. Mann sarcastically rejoined that ice lie had voted for an appropriation of O.uOO for rural free delivery and had en that appropriation grow to ?4000t>,0 a year. He didn't like indeterminate opositlons where money was concerned. "Anyhow." cried Mr. Mann, "liow far is is tiling of 'pleasing the people' going go? We are as bad as the old Romans th their feasts and tights, etc., for the nefit of the people.'1 Mr. Olcott suggested that other cities id free lecture courses. 'Yes." cried Mr. Mann, "and those ci'.ies y their own bills. Here the people of e United States have to pay half the lis at least." Representative Goulden of .New York eaded for the lecture course, and ofred wh'lc the yonse laughed, to deliver lecture free himself if the bill passed. K-p. esentative Giilett of Massachusetts Id the matter had been threshed out by e appropriations committee several >ars ago. and that committee had deled the lectures were not necessarily ong the line of education, but were a cans of gratifying the tastes of the peoe who attended. It was not in the evince ol' Congress to go into the busisss of entertaining the people of the istrlct of Columbia. Representative Foster of Vermont antunced himself heartily in favor of the opositlon. The free lectures, he ought, constituted a step toward ideal hool system conditions.

In the amendment he named the following as members of the commission: Lieut. Gens. Chaff eo and Bates, Maj. Gens. Davis and Jesse Lee and Brig. Gen. Daggett, all retired army officers. Wants Fair Tribunal. He explained that his purpose in introducing this amendment was to provide a ; tribunal where the accused soldiers might ! confront their accusers and answer testl[ mony with testimony. He had not be lleved sucli a move would be necessary, he said, but during the summer vacation he received .letters from several of the soldiers, who said that government detectives. or men who said they were government detectives, had been trying to get them to make confessions by telling them that their comrades had confessed and by threatening them with summary action on Xhe part of the Texas authorities,, to whom they might be turned over if they were not careful. "Of course these were not secret service men," declared Mr. Foraker, "because that would be contrary to law." He read one of the letters in which a, soldier declared that a Texas detective tokl him that It had been proven that Company B did the shooting and that the government knew already the names of three of the men, "but we want to know the whole gang." He said*the detectives had asked him whether Mr. Foraker had told him how to swear, and he had replied in the negative. He said also that the detectives had told him that if he did not confess he wou'.d be sent to Texas and might never return. Mr. Foraker declared that this letter showed what efforts the government was making to find out the names. Contrary to Constitution. "I believe none of the soldiers did the shooting." he went on, "but I may bo mistaken. But there is a right way and a. wrong way to do this sort of thing. These men shou.d have an opportunity to confront their accusers. Anything else is contrary to tHe spirit of the Constitution. It is time this whole matter was brought into the open." At this point Senator Culberson of Texas said that he understood the Pres.dent had sent a special message to Congress today on the subject of the Brownsville raid, and lie asked that it be read at once. The President's message was then read. Air- Culberson then asked that the report of He.rbert J. Brown, the governments detective. should be read in full, and this was done. This report accompanied tha message. During the reading Senator Foraker waited very impatiently, and aa aoon aa it was over he took the floor again and declared that his information about the employment of the secret service detectives by the government had merely beeu corroborated by the President's statement and the report of Mr. Brown. He believed the testimony of the colored boIoie.s betore tne Senate committee on military affairs had been the truth. Signed "His Mark.*' "I call attention to the fact," he said, "that the negro Lawson, who makes such a smooth and high-sounding statement, signed It with his mark." Thlr- reference to one of the affidavit* contained in tho President's message caused much laughter. "Oh. Mr. President, we haven't got to the bottom of the matter yet, and I believe when wo do wo will be very mucli ashamed of it." Several letters from Boyd Conyers, one I of the discharged soldiers, now living at Monroe. (5a., were read by Mr. Foraker. The Conyert' '.etters told of the efforts of a colored detective to "pick" him about the Brownsville affair, and how he had succeeded in making the detective leave town after the detective had tried la vain to make him teil lies, Mr. Foraker then read (our letters wlilclt nan passed between himself and Conyer^ and when lie tiad flms/ied them oeciared that they were the entire correspondence wnich was referred to hy the President, lie asked if exception could be laaen to any of thern. Sixth Time on Trial. "Is anything more atrocious than thm treatment of tnese men?" he asked. "TtUe is the sixtih time they have been placed on trial, and. I believe, acquitted. "On. shame upon ? government that will employ all of Its power not to protect men who are charged with crime and give them a fair trial, but to prove an Innocent man to be guilty. It is the most cowardly thing I can conceive of. "I did not know the President would send a message today on ' thin matter until I got Into the chamber. That did not make me offer my amendment nor did it deter me. Let us give these men a chance before an Independent and juat tribunal." Mr. F'oraker was still speaking whta jrhe Star's report closed. v
