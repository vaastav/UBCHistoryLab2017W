Congress convened last Monday, Let's have another railroad or two. Enforce the local option ordinance m a Let us have an electric fire alarm sys tem. Washington 0. H. is now a city of the second class. John G. Carlisle was re-elected Speak er of the Honse. Isn't it time for Cleveland's "veto" mill to commence grinding ? a e The trial of Harper, of Fidelity Bank fame, is in progress at Cincinnati. "More action and less talk" should be the motto of the present Congress. Other towns enforce the local option ordinance. Why can not Hillsboro ? w Now that the French have lost their Orevy oleomargarine will be greatly in demand. The county seat of Fayette county is to have another newspaper. It will be Democratic in politics. a If, as the Qazette claims, tho saloon keepers sell more liquor now than they did before the ordinance was passed, why is it that the saloon keepers wish the ordinance repealed ? e e Now that the post-office department has become self-BUstaining, and as the surplus is now entirely too large, why should not Congress cut down the post age rate on letters to one cent per ounce and the rate on papers in proportion ? sab Georgia's vote,which elects ten Demo cratic Congressmen, is a little over one- third of that Dakota, yet the Democracy claims that there is no injustice in keep ing that great territory out of tho Union until after the presidential election of 188S. a The Board of State Charities, compos ed of gentlemen belonging to both poli tical parties, represent that the State in stitutions are in better condition now than they ever before found them. All this Messrs. Powell & Co. to the contrary notwithstanding. The Presidents message, for the first time in the historv of our country, dis cusses but one question the tariff. The President regards the reduction and revision of the tariff as of paramomt and vital importance, and for that reason treats of it alone. As to the af fairs of the different departments he re fers Congress to the reports of the vari ous Cabinet officers. At the first opportunity Senator Pal mer, of Michigan, will present to Con gress a bill which should by all means bo adopted. The bill is intended to regulate immigration to this country, and will make it necessary for immi grants to secure from the United States Consul of the district from which they come certificates as to their good char acter. The passage of this bill would prevent the overrunning of our country by Nihilists, Anarchists, Socialists, and the slum of all foreign countries.
