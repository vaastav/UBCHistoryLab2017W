Senate* The opening ol the session la the Senate was pr?ceeded by a lively hail hour of handshaking and gossip between Senators and their friends. Several of the desks of Senators were decorated with floral tributes sent by their admirers, the most favored in chls respect being Senator liormau. The galleries were, as is usual on opening days, well filled with strangers. Promptly at noon the President of the senate caileu the body to order. Prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. liuutley, chaplain of the Senate, On morion of Mr. Logan, the secretary was Instructed to inform the House of Representatives that a quorum of the Senate was assembled, and that tlie senate was ready to proceed to business.

Sheilleld, who had been apppoiilted by tlie governor of Hliode Island to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Anthouy. On motion of Mr. Cockre'l the Senate then, at 12:10, took a recess of half nn hour. At th3 expiration of the recess the senate proceeded to the consideration oi tne usual morning ; Lusiuess. bills introduced. Bills were Introduced and appropriately referred, among them the following: By Mr. CuHorn?To prohibit distinctions b?ing made in the military service of the United Stat es against any class of i American citizens. To enable officers of the army to be retired with the rank and full pay of the grade to which they may have been so promoted lor gallant services during the warof the rebellion, and to relieve from active service upon their own application oUlcers of the army who served in the war of the rebellion. By Mr. Dolph?to authorize the transfer of one l of the vessels of the Greely n-iier expedition to the t Treasury department for a revenue cutter, and the retention of the other two for use In the navy. A message was received from the House of Represent itives, announcing that body tobereadv'to proceed to business. 

FENCES II.Lf2lsA.LLV ERKC7KD OS THE FCELIC DOMAIN. Mr. Ingalls offered a resolution, which was agreed to, instructing tlie committee on public lands to report such legislation as may be necessary to authorize the Sucretary of the Interior lo summariiy remove all feuoes Illegally constructed i on the public domain of tlie United States. On motion or Mr. Hawley, at 12:55 p. ia., another ' recess of half an hour was taken. jj Atl::55 p. in. the President's message was re, ceivcd by tiif Senate, and Its reading was at once i proceeded with. senator anthony's death announced. The reading of the message was listened to with deej) interest. It was concluded at 2:25, when Mr. Aktrlcli. in a few feeling words, made formal announcement of senator Autiiony's death. adjourned. As a mark of respect to senator Anthonys mem* ory the Senate then, at 2:25 p. m., on Mr. Aldrlch's motion, adjourned till to-morrow. Il??u?e of liepresentatives. Though the galleries of the House were wellfllled this morning with spectators anxious to view the proceedings attendant on the first day of a session, tlu-re was an absence of that crush of visitors which usually characterizes guch an occasion. Numerous floral designs ornamented rne desks of favorite members. Promptly at noon the speaker's gavel called the House to order. In his np. nlug prayer the chaplain gave thanks that the members had beeu permitted to return in health and safety to their legislative dutl?s. 220 members present. Tne roll call disclosed the presence of 222 members?more than a quorum?and the clerk was directed to inform tlie Senate that the House was ready to proceed to business. The Speaker appointed Messrs. Randall. Cox, of X?*w York, and Browne, of Indiana, as a committee to wait upon the President, in conjunction, with a similar committee from the Senate, and Inform him that Congress is ready to receive anv communication he may be pleased to make. a new member sworn in. Mr. Ilolman (Ind.) presented the credentials of B. T. Shively, as member-elect from the 13th Indiana district, to bucceed W. H. Calkins, resigned, and that gentleman appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of office. At 12:35 the House took a recess for fifteen minutes. heading the message. After the expiration of the recess tne House waited Idly until the President's private secretary, Mr. Pruden, appeared (at 1:40 p.m) with the President's annual message, and it was immediately read by the clerk. After the messaee was read the nouse adjourned out of respect to the memory of Representatives Duncan and Evlns, recently uei-eased. Capitol Topic*. flowers for senator tforman. Senator Gorrtian's desk In the Senate to-day was almost hidden beneath two large and handsome floral pieces constructed by J. 1L Small, the florist, to express the admiration of the Senator's friends for his labors In the campaign. One of the pieces represented a vacant senatorial chair, which bore the suggestive legend, '-Reserved for Arthur P. Gorman in 1877," when the Senator's present term expires. Tne other was a gigantic rooster, of the approved democratic species, which seemed about to Pap its perlumed wings and startle the Senate by a vigorous crow. republican senators wn.l not be obstructionists. Senator McMillan, of Minnesota, does not believe that the republican majority of the next Senate will refuse to confirm Cleveland's appointments, lie says the republican Senators will not put themselves in the attitude of obstructionists. speaker carlisle thinks the tariff question had better oo over till next session. Speaker Carllsie Bays he tiilhks any attempt to bring up the tariff question tlU3 session would meet with the same fate It did la3t winter. The same forces, he says, would be at work, and another deieat would be prejudicial to the cause. Tiiererore, he thinks, it better that the matter should go over until next session, when they will Lave plenty of lime, and the relosmers will be unquestionably in power. A proper revision of the tariff, he thinks, could then be naa. caucus of republican senators. After the adjournment of the Senate the republican Senators met in caucus. A omuiittee was appointed to rearrange the mem bershlp of committees, more especial'y to fill the vacancies e used by the death of Setiatur Anthony. The caucus was In session only five minutes. th3 senate di*tmct committer wiil retain't* former -lay of meeting. Friday, and to-duy a call lor a meeting next Friday was issued. Chairman Jngails said to a Stap reporter that the i pending District business would be promptly taken | up and evei y effort made to dispose of it. .?i ! Defensive Works on I.aiul and Wafer. ! appropriations likely to be made for fortifications and the navy. The questions of fortifying the country and reconstructing the navy will receive serious consideration from tho House appropriations committee this session. A number of members of the committee with whom a Star reporter has talked have come to the conclusion that the time has come when the defenses of the country should be looked after. Members who opposed the expenditure of money ror constructing fortifications last session have expressed their willingness to supDort an appropriation for that purpose now. They say al.-.o that there no longer remains an excuse for not. reviving the navy, and that they expect steps to be taken soon to make it one of the most perfect? though not the largest?in the world. The commerce of the country they expect to be built up by the democratic policy, and a navy will be necessary for its protection. The trade with the South American states and the West Indies is expected to be largely extended. A tangled condition of affairs Is likely to arise from any action on the part of tuls country to enforce the "American policy" with relation to the construction or the Panama canal, and the existence of an effective navy might serve to facilitate a peaceful settlement of the matter. The Allejjod Navy Department Frands* another defendant files demurrers. In the. Criminal Court, Judge Wylie, to-day, Mr. Bell Mann, one of the parties charged with presenting false vouchers to the Navy department, filed demurrers to the Indictments agaln&t him. - A Convention ol Post Office Clerks. This morning, delegates representing the post office clerks met here to frame a bill and procure . legislation by Congress so as to place the post office clerks on the same footing as clerks In other departments. There were delegates present from Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, Buffalo and Lou is vine, a room was procured at Abner's, and a recess was taken till 8 o'clock. A Straw Bond Case.
