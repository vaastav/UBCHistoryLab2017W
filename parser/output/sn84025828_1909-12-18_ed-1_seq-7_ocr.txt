Another meeting will be held to-night. "There are two ways of stopping the wholesale slaughter of our Inhabit ants," said Professor Morris. "Ono Is to elevate the tracks and the other Is to take them out. I am Informed that the Illinois Central Railroad Company has threatened to take out Its tracks if we Insist on elevation. We are a nation of poker players, and I believe that we recognize this as a bluff, and I am ready to call their bluff." Before the meeting closed a commit tee to visit the city track elevation expert Saturday morning and talk with him 'about methods to pursue In seeking elevation was appointed. LIBRARY BOARD CHANGES. By a reclassification of tho service of the Chicago public library, as pro posed to the directors Monday night by Director Graham Taylor, chairman of a special committee appointed for that purpose, employes may be pro moted by merit from one grade or position to another In direct line ac cording to civil servlco rules. The re port was laid over until the next reg ular meeting. Circulating branch li braries will be opened at the follow ing reading rooms: Ogden Park, Da vis Square, Russell Square, Hamilton Park, Sherman Park, West Park No. 1 and West Park No. 2. The-AuBtln branch library will be opened early In January and the one at Lincoln Cen ter about Feb. 1. FOR PROTECTION FOR THE PEO PLE. After a conference Wednesday be tween Commissioner of Track Eleva tion Walter J. Raymer and Aldermen of the Twenty-second, Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth and Twen-tj-elxta wards. It was announced that an agreement had been reached where by the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Road will be asked to elevate the tracks of Its Evaniton branch by sec tions, beginning at tho north end of the extension. The estimated cost is about 12,500,000. Alderman Jacob A. Hey, of the Twenty-third Ward, will ask Corpora tion Counsel Brundage to determine the validity of the St., Paul company's claim to right of occupancy In Bloom Ingdale Toad. Hlbbard, Spencer, Bartlett ft Co. sell a great deal of hardware to tho city. More or, less several tnousona col lars' worth' annually. A. C. Bartlett is the managing genius for this concern, It Is claimed. A. C. Bartlett Is a member of the Merrlam Commission. He ts talked of for Governor, for Senator, for Mayor. He Is talked of as a city contractor who is Investigating his own con tracts. There Is n good deal of gossip about this, as Mr. Bartlett Is looked upon as a great reformer. How men like Mn Bartlett and that $10,000 beauty, Walter L. Fisher, can have the nervo to investigate McGov em and Cumralngs and others under the circumstances Is past finding out. The people do not think that Mr. Bartlett or Mr. Fisher or any one else Is too good to Investigate. The Idea of their investigating other lovers of money Is something laugh aWe, Isn't It? The city purchasing agent must go. This is agreed upon on all sides, although the manner of his going Is not. That Comptroller Wilson is a good man to Investigate him is also Home what questionable. But to Bartlett and Fisher but one reply can be. They hall from "Business Methods" and Its famous apple tree. As a fruit of those business methods report also sought to connect Mr. Cole man's brother-in-law, William A. Pros ser, 1537 East Sixty-sixth street, with city purchasos. Mr. Coleman, though, said there was no foundation In truth for this. ' ,.., "iMr. Prosser Is my brother-in-law," Mr. Coleman said, "but ho Is not In business for himself. Ho works for Hlbbard, Spencer, Bartlett ft Co., and is a department manager. Yes. that company sells supplies to the city, but not because of Mr. Pressor's connoc tlon with It. The annual purchases from that, concern are not more than $3,000, and every Item is on compotl tlve bidding." Chris. Carr, who is a brother of Commissioner Hanberg's wife, 1? said to ihave sold annually about $4,000 worth of lesser hardware to tho city. At Mr. Coleman's office It was said Mr. Carr bad ibeen selling to the city for eighteen years. Why Investigate Chris. Carr and leave Mr. Bartlett's firm out? The Merrlam Commission U asked to look Into the deals of the following Arms with the purchasing agent's of fice: Hlbbard, Spencer, Bartlett ft Co., of which Investigator Bartlett Is the lead ing light. T. A. Cummtngs Foundry Company; castings. Seven lumber companies. Western Engineers' Supply Com pany; oils, packings, etc. Robert R. Campbell; paints. Christian Carr, Jr.; hardware. Standard Oil Company; gasoline and kerosene. M, H. Rogers & Co., Mueller Coal Company; coal. J. W. Fernald Company; straw and feed, McLaughlin Building Material Com pany; sand and stone. f Parker-Washington Co.; crushed atone. George B. Llmbert ft Co.; pipe and fittings. John Mohr ft Sons; boiler parts. 'Machinist Supply Company; tools, screws, etc. , D. J. Gallagher ft Co.; cotton waste. W. H. Salisbury; rubber goods. H. Channon Company; cordage, nails, etc. Chicago Fire Hose Company. American Development and Engi neering Company. Chicago Steel and Brass Company. And a hundred others. We do not look for results from the Merrlam Commission. But there are a hundred firms that ought to bo asked by somebody as to what their relations have been with tho city. How many firms doing business with the purchasing agent's office have been asked to extend favors to "friends" of that office? A grand jury might find out. Other people can. Because other people have found out. It the purchasing agent's office Is run on business principles, there should be no good reason for writ ing letters to, people asking favors for others, simply because these people sell goods to the city. How many city contractors have been asked to favor this one, or that one, because the city buys from them? This should not be hard to find out, from what we hear. The purchasing agent's office Is in for it. It will get what It has been look ing for. Following are the latest discoveries In the city purchasing agent's Investi gation: That a largo amount of material, such as cement, brick, sand, and grav el for the Board of Local Improve ments and the Department of Public Works Is bought on requisition, with out any saving to the city over the competitive bid and contract plan. That there has been n change In the method of handling requisitions from the purchasing agent's department since Nov. 11. Complete information regarding all purchases is now sent to the Comptroller's office. That W. H. Gnntz, audit clerk in the Comptroller's office, Is supposed to check tho prices on all purchases made by the business agent. That thero was collusion among tho contractors who sold feed to tho city previous to the time William Coleman became business agent. " That the Merrlam commission pro poses to scrutinize the purchases made through Business Agent Coleman from the following fifteen companies, firms, and Individuals: T. A. Cummlngs Foun dry Company,' Garden City Sand Com pany, General Electric Company, West ern Electric Company, Illinois Fire proof Covering Co., George B. Llmbert & Co., Mencham ft Wlght, National Tubo Company, Peerless Light Com pany, J. W. Fernald Company, R. R. Campbell, McLaughlin Building Mate rial Company, Peter OIsou & Co. The city purchasing agent's depart ment Is helping out too many "official publications," according to many firms who sell goods to the city. This sort of hold-up was "all right" under Dunne and Harrison, but wo don't think Busse will stand for what has boon done with city contractors. Mayor Busse wants a free, full and fair Investigation by tho Merrlam Commission. Ho sent the following to tho City Council on tho subject: "It has come to my notice through newspaper reports and otherwise that somo opposition may develop In your honorablo body to nn additional ap propriation to pay the expenses of the commission on municipal expenditures.- I hope these reports are un founded. Strict official etiquette would prescribe that I refrain from express ing an opinion on the subject at this time (before the subject is officially before me), but the unusual character of the situation will excuse me, I hope, for taking the step, "I am In favorof providing for the commission on municipal expenditures all the money it may need for carry tng, to the sarltMt possible conclu- r. i ' ' 1 -I , "-, 'y r- ' slon, the most thorough possible In- qulry Into municipal expenditures. I hope such provision will bo made without delay. All of us, tho mem bers of your honorablo body as well as tho members of tho executive and administrative branches of the muni cipal government, ought to bo Inter ested in having tho work of this com mission done as thoroughly as pos sible and as quickly as Is consistent with searching work to tho end that wo may get n report which will In fairness and completeness Justify tho undertaking. "I appointed this commission on municipal expenditures by your au thority. Three of Its members arc members of your honorablo body, Ald erman Merrlam, Alderman Snow, and Alderman Finn. The other members are Walter H. Wilson, controller of the city of Chicago; David R. Forgan, A. C. Bartlett, Frank I. Bennett, Wil liam A. Tllden, John W. Alvord, George O. Tunell and Wnlter L. Fish er. I appointed these men because I had confidence In their Integrity, their Judgment, their fairness and their ability to make an Inquiry of this kind. "Somo of them agreed to servo only at my earnest personal solicitation. For this reason, If for no other, I would regret to sco any action tnken by your honorablo body which might be construed by prejudiced minds to look like a disposition to hamper tho commission's operations. "But the main reason for being lib oral with this commission Is thnt wo all want the Inquiry Into municipal expenditures to be as thorough as pos sible. "I hope it will go Into the' expen ditures of every department and bu reau of the municipal government every pumping station, every engine house, every police station, every nook and cranny. It should cover not only the workvof the various departments and bureaus to-day, but the work of these departments and bureaus In tho past. "It should devolop the loose prac tices and customs that havo grown up with the years of shirting admin istrations. It should concern Itself with nil the transactions of tho re spective departments, not merely with scattered incidents. It should concern itself, with getting at tho facts nil tho facts concerning each depart ment." Hero's nnothor good reason for abolishing the purchasing agent's of fice: During tho last eleven years about $260,000 worth of city property has been sold Illegally. Tho solos of Junk and unusablo material by city busi ness agents since that office was creat ed In 1808 hnvo been contrary to tho State law. By coincidence alone and not as an effect of the attack on tho methods of tho present bustnoss agent, Howard W. Hayes, assistant corporation coun sel, who Is revising tho city codo, re cently gave an opinion that tho city council has no statutory power to delegate its powers of sale to any offi cial. The opinion wns given Nov. 3 that Is, beforo tho expose of tho Cummlngs foundry affair and othor, matters In connection with tho department of supplies but It now is given added Importance becauso tho sales of Junk and old material amounting to $20, 151, In 1908 havo begun tov receive tho samo attention given to tho pur chases by tho samo office.
