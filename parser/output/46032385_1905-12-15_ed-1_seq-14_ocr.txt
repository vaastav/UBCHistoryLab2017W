He said that Mr. Roosevolt had givon con gress "excellont advice In rather a voluminous style," but he Intimated that the president ought to see to it that tho policyholders money, con tributed to his campaign fund, was re turned. He told the senate bluntly that "it is considered by the American peoplo to be corruptible and corrupt ed. It is believed to bo influenced by corporations." He added: "We are not all in jail, but there are sbrno lame 'duchs among us. For my part I would be glad if we could clean the Augean stable and lift the senate out of the fog of dishonor and disgrace which now invests it." A dispatch to the New York World, under date of Peoria, 111., November 20. follows: "An electrical paddling machine, invented by Prof. Dennis, iB now in operation in the public school in East Penna, a suburb." The mode of operation is to place the recalcitrant pupil over a chair near the" spanking machine, press a but ton and the flow of electricity starts a 'series of paddles in operation which play upon the anatomy of the spankee. Residents of the village have protest ed and declare they will take their children from school if the use of the machine is not stopped."

The fore going constitute the cabinet. The fol lowing' are not in the cabinet? Lord lieutenant of Ireland, the Earl of Ab eiden; lord chancellor of Ireland, Right Hon Samuel Walker; first com missioner of works and public build ings, Lewis Vernon Harcourt." New York Press, (Republican,) Fortunately the prosident begins with the railroads, the most important problem before the country; and the, public may be urged to push on cour ageously through that part. Let us get at it, then. Wisely, vigorously and with conviction the president re peats his demand for rate legislation that will cure, not prolong the rebate disease. In somewhat guarded and entirely polite language he exposes the Foraker fraud bills and the Elkiiis trust bulletins but clearly, and with force, he reiterates what ought to be done, what must be done, if the Amer ican people aro not to make of the transportation systems a public, in stitution like the postofllce. New York Tribune, (Republican,)-4 President Roosevelt is not making merely conventional recommendations.. He evidently feels that he has issueB to deal with profoundly affecting the, moral fiber and the social life, of the people and that the smallest part vb his mission is to tell congress what bills should in his opinion be passed He must also appeal to the people,, show them the reasonableness of what they might otherwise consider danger-i ous innovations and argue the vexed questions out in their larger aspects. Some of his suggestions involve, if not novel conceptions of the function; of the federal government, far-readh-ing efforts to adapt its instrumental- ities to the new conditions under which, with the evolution of our bush ness life, they must work. . New York Evening Post, (Independ ent,) To judge by his message, Presi dent Roosevelt has become the weak-i est of stand patters one without real) convictions, that is, and swayed only, by political expediency. He masses the futilities for doing nothing with the tariff in the most approyed man ner in a manner, we add, that will be approved by those life insurance officials and othejs who paid money to the republican committee last year on the distinct understanding that thel tariff plunder was to be let alone. This suggests another part of liis mes sage which is disappointly feeble., His references to political corruption; and especially to contributions to cam the' paign committees by corporations, are the not what was expected of Theodore Roosevelt. He perfunctorily renews his recommendation that there be publication of campaign expenditures and would have all contributions by corporations forbidden by law; but he makes no allusion to the scandal ous diversion of trust- funds "to aid in his own election; has no word of in dignant repudiation of his own agents who sought and received such unlaw ful contributions. To this, then, his reported- byster Bay indignation has simmered down. New York Herald, (Independent,) Centralization of power in Washing ton, federal control of pretty nearly everything and everybody, is the dominant tone of the president's views, and which he urges congress to back up and make possible by federal tlaws. He uses the undemo cratic word "sovereign" in speaking of the power that should control and supervise the doings of corporations. It is a word, by the way, that may stick unpleasantly in the public mind, excellent as tho idea may be that un ruly corporations need the president to go after. them with his "big stick." New York Sun, (Independent,) It will be seqn from our skeleton of President Roosevelt's elaborate and earnest presentation of his' views on rate fixing, that he lias receded in nowise from 'his former position con cerning the essential point of differ ence. Chicago Tribime, (Republican,) The president has much to say on the subject of railroad rates, but little that is new. The tariff revision ques tion is one which the president con siders of secondary importance or too delicate for discussion. If the presi dent could only condense a diffuse sentence into a few weighty words his messages would be state docu ments that allv would read and enjoy. Chicago Record-Herald, (Republi can,) -Li we were askedt to give a general idea of the president's mes sage in the fewest possible words we should say that the writer "stands pat." This would cover the passages on the absorbing topic of railroad rates pretty thoroughly. Such changes as are made .from the message of last year indicate no change what ever in spirit and purpose. The one distinctly disappointing passage in the message relates to the general tariff question. It contains nothing to en courage'tfte advocates of tariff reform. Kansas ity Journal, (Republican,) That portion of the message dealing; with raiiroads will no doubt prove ,a surprise to those who have been prod ding the .president to take an .extreme attitude. ' Sioux City Journal, (Republican,) The Roosevelt revealed in the .mes sage is a positive Roosevelt, but not a. radical.

He advises that the power bo given to this commission or, "to some other administrative body created bv congress." This alternate e will give the railroads the chance to seek to divide the forces favoring regulation It complicates the situation. It opens the door to the railroads for possible escape. "Give the commission power" was a simple .remedy. It was a de mand presenting a plain issue. The alternative means more machinery and gives the railroads the chance to help make and control the machinery. Later in his message the president refers constantly to the "commission" as the regulating body and this fact indicates probably his preference for the commission rather than for a new body.' St. Louis Globe Democrat, (Repub lican,) As was expected, the leading place in the massage is given to the necessity of railroad rate regulation by the national government, but thi3 'is only a small part of the scheme of governmental supervision over the great activities which he proposes. "In order to insure a healthy social and industrial life," he says, "every big corporation should he held respon sible by and accountable to some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct," and, obviously, tho only power adequate to this task is tho government of the United States. Ho repeats and emphasizes his recom mendation of 1904 for a supervision and regulation by the national govern ment of interstate transactions in in surance. Denver News, (Democrat,) The president in his message came down in the square-toed fashion expected of him pn the question of railroad rate regulation. But he placed the matter in its true perspective by showing that it is a part of the general prob lem of corporation control, of first importance because so closely related to all other forms of corporate activity!
