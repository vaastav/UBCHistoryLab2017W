THE Del .Jit', .Ml/., tier. 10, ISOO. Congrop.: aid tho P.-ctidont’s Hexane. Tlie following is tlic uoikloiibcil Account of tho I'o-usscmliling of Congress :uu\, (lie President's Message, taken from tlie Halti mnre Sun of Tuesday, as also tin* report of tlie Postmaster General: TUB REASSEMBLING OF CONOHKSS. The second session of the fortieth Congress commenced at Washington yesterday.— There was a quorum present in both hou ses, and soon after meeting a committee was appointed to wait on the President, who sent in his annual message. In both houses a large number of bills, pending at the last session, were introduced and re ferred. In the House objections were made to swearing in Messrs. Sherrard and Dix, of Alabama, and they were directed to “stand aside” until their credentials are ex amined. A bill was introduced to admit the Representatives of Virginia immediate ly, but it was ruled out of order, and sub sequently referred to the committee on elections, as was also the case of tho mem bers from Mississippi. the president's message. The president’s message has at leas! tlie merit of brevity, and it-is to lie hoped may become a model in that respect for the com munications oi his successor's. After enumerating tho various blessings which wc enjoy as a people, the President refers to what has been accomplished in the matter of restoring the State govern ments and to the special case of Georgia, in whichjhe seems to think that reconstruc tion in that instance requires to be recon structed, and recommends a law author izing the Governor of that State to con vene all the members originally elected to tho Legislature, requiring each member to take tho oath prescribed by the reconstruc tion acts, and none to be admitted who are ineligible under the third clause of tho fourteenth amendment. The loss of our commerce, resulting, as is alleged, from the war, will be the subject of a special message. The restoration of Virginia is recommended, and hope expressed that the acts of the Texas and Mississippi Leg islatures, when they meet, may bo such ns to receive the approval of Congress, and close the work of reconstruction. On the subject of tho finances the tone of the President: is generally healthy, though cautious and very conservative. He shows an earnest appreciation of the evils of an irredeemable and fluctuating currency and the necessity for a return to the specie basis, for which, he admits, no substitute can be devised. Immediate resumption of specie payments, however, if practicable, is not considered desirable, and such legis lation is recommended as will ensure a gradual return to it. To put “an immedi ate stop to fluctuation in the value of tlie currency,” it is suggested that tlie treasury lie authorized to redeem its own paper, at a fixed price, whenever presented, and to withhold from circulation all currency so redeemed until sold again for gold. In view of our increasing ability to pay, the President suggests also as feasible the policy of redeeming our 5 and 0 per cent, loans as they become; subject to be called in, by the negotiafum of other bonds bear ing 4 and 4-j per cent, interest. The Pres ident recommends the postponement of a general revision of the tariff and taxation laws for the present, but suggests a re newal Of the tax on incomes,"at a reduced rate, say of 3 per cent., and this to expire in three years. The revenues of this coun try afo greater than tho requirements, and may with safety be reduced; but £Ts the fund ing in a 4 or a 4J per cent, loan would re duce the annual current expenses largely, thu,s after funding, justifying a greater re duction of taxes than would how be ex pected, be suggests the postponement of the question till the next Congress, though in stances of burdensome discrimination might now lie modified. In regard to Cuba, while sympathizing with it, tlie contest lias at no time assumed a condition sufficient to justify a recogni tion of belligerency, but tlie principle is maintained that this government is its own judge when to accord that right. It is hoped that the good offices of the Uni ted States may yet prove advantageous for a settlement* Tho subject of tho Darien canal is favor ably mentioned. The only grave question which the Union lias with any foreign na tion is that concerning the Alabama claims. Tlie President regarded the late conven tion as misconceived in its scope, and not calculated to secure a hearty settlement, and therefore approved its rejection by tlie Senate as in the interests of peace. Ho makes quite a summary of the con siderations to lie provided for, beyond mere commercial claims, and hopes the time will soon arrive when the two governments can approacli the solution of the momentous subject satisfactorily. Tlie question of the Spanish gunboats it is briefly stated lias been referred to the courts. The remainder of the message treats of tlie landing of the French telegraphic ca ble upon our soil, and promisee endeavors to secure by negotiation an abandonment of the principle of monopolies in ocean telegraphic cables; citizenship of tlie Un ited States; our relations to China and Ja pan, and such legislation as will preclude tlie enslavement of the Chinese under the name pf coolies; recommendation of a total repeat of thotcnure-of-oflice nct; and, in re gard to the Indians, of placing them on large reservations as speedily ns cop be done. Reference is made also to the reports of the various heads of departments. The message is in general a clear and coprehcn sive documents, and wc may hereafter have •occasion to refer more specially, to some of its most important recommendations.
