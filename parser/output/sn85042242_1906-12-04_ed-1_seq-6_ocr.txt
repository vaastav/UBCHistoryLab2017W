THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The Tribune gives today the full text of President Roosevelt's mes­ sage to congress. As usual, the presi­ dent's recommendations are vigorous and will repay careful reading. The •conservatives will differ- with him on some of his recommendations, but he has the faculty of appealing to the great mass of the people and of ob­ taining from congress what legislation he desires. He touches a vital truth when he deprecates the preaching of "mere discontent" by labor agitators, and his views on the race question are the well known ones he has been known always to maintain. His demand for more complete control of corporations is in line with the trend of public sentiment. His advocacy of an in­ heritance and income tax will be popular with (those who have been educated to believe that too large fortunes are a menace to the average welfare of all the people. It is a serious question whether congress should penalize large accumulations •of wealth toy a tax such as has been suggested and congress will no doubt hear some brilliant debates on this question. Other recommendations in the message deal largely with depart­ mental questions and do not touch any un«s«al topics. It will suggest itself to Jibe reader, that the presi­ dent's strenuosity is reflected in the amplitude and scoge of his message and that his Is a remarkable mentality that can find tinr#-*W deal 'sto 'fully with so many que^ens, fai addition to1 performing'* his 'Villiferous executive duties. 3^ The length of President Roosevelt's message and the" multiplicity of the subjects covered adds another chapter to the remarkable career of this re­ markable man. us -when the presi­ dent finds time to devote to so much library work is one of the enigmas of this administration and an evidence -Of the strenuosity of the life of the man. Not only is the president pro­ lific 'but he is interesting. He writes nothing that is bad. His composition is good and his conclusions sound. He probably makes many mistakes hut the people either do not see them or overlook thein. Few can be found who are bold enough to criticise Roosevek.. There is a boldness about hl3 manner—a departure from the 'Customary—that pleases the people. Contingencies may arise that will cause republicans to regret he has •Ijeen so positive in Mg assertions" that lie will not accept a renomination for another term. The great task that now seems to burden the state democracy—as she fe writ in the democratic" press—is the selection .of the next republican candi­ date for United States senator In thi" state. The democrats do not need to worry about that. There'll be plenty Of "fern under the primary election law. Now that "geottte" is on the Grand Forks 'Press no other paper can com .pete with the democratic organ—in "pi»e" dreams—and Jud LaMoure's fecent visit was a great inspiration for "spooks." Governor-elect Burke is discovering nany tried and true democrats and admiring republicans who "helped do it"—an4 want to continue tbeir services-Hlfe already is any $fM,ifflt a pleasant dream.

ADVERSE TO THE MEN s!? SUPREME COURT LDEClO£S THE HABEAS CORPUS CASE8 0F MOYER AND OTHER! MUST REMAIN IN JAIL IN IDAHO PRISONERS CHARGED WITH COM­ PLICITY IN MURDER OF FOR- MER GOVERNOR. Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme court of the United States has de­ cided the habeas corpus cases of Moyer, Haywood and Pettibone, the representatives of the Western Fed­ eration of Miners who are now held in prison in Idaho on the charge of com­ plicity in the murder of former Gov­ ernor Steunenberg, adversely to the ipen. The opinion was by Justice Har­ lan. The effect of the decision will be to continue to hold' the men in con­ finement for trial in Idaho. Of the men involved Charles H. Moyer is president, W. D. Haywooid secretary-treasure*- and George A. Pet­ tibone a member of the Western Fed­ eration of Miners. They are now in prison in Idaho, under a charge of mur­ dering former Governor Stuenenberg of that state, although it was not charged that they were present when the crime was committed. The cases came to this court on an appeal from a decision of the Idaho federal court refusing to grant writs of habeas cor­ pus. The principal point of contro­ versy was the method by which the Idaho authorities secured jurisdiction over the men. All of them are resi­ dents of Colorado and it was alleged on behalf of Moyer and his associ­ ates that they were kidnapped in pur­ suance of conspiracy to which the gov­ ernor of Colorado and the Idaho au­ thorities were parties and thus juris diction was acquired by federal court. Justice Harlan said in the habeas corpus proceedings in the United States court the matter of extradition of the defendants was not material. The merits of the case were not in­ volved, as that phase wa°s not pre­ sented. The only question there in­ volved was the right of the state courts to proceed with the cases, of which there could be no doubt. 

UNDER ANTI-TRUST LAW. City of Atlanta Wins Suit Against Pipe Combine.' Washington, Dec. 4.—The supreme court of the United States has decjded the case of the city of Atlanta, 6a.,' against the so-called "pipe line trust" in favor of the city. The title of the case as it was presented to the court was the Chattanooga Foundry and Pipe Works and South Pittsburg Pipe company vs. the city of Atlanta, the case coming to this court in pursu­ ance of an effort by the pipe manu­ facturers to secure the reversal of a decision by the circuit court of ap­ peals, which was unfavorable to them. The suit was instituted by the city under the Sherman anti-trust law on the complaint that by the combina­ tion of the manufacturers the munici­ pality had been compelled to paj an excess of $15,000 over a fair price on orders for pipe amounting to $66,000. The city asked damages in the sum of $45,000, or three times the amount of loss, but the court of appeals, affirming a decision by the circuit court for East Tennessee, allowed $7,000. The essential violation of the law alleged was that all the pipemakers had so manipulated their bids as to throw the contracts to the Annlston Pipe and Foundry company of Anniston, Ala., rendering that company's bids the lowest offered, notwithstanding they were still exorbitant. "SHOT UP" DAKOTA TOWN. Disclosure Concerning Past Record of Colored Troops. Washington, Dec. 4.—The war de­ partment is preparing for an investi­ gation by congress of the case of the companies of the Twenty-fifth infantry, recently discharged without honor by order of President Roosevelt, and to this end has compiled a record of negro troops dating back to the Civil war. It is said that this record dis­ closes a Btate of affairs not generally known—that once before at least the Twenty-fifth infantry "shot up a town." The affair happened In 1885 at Fort Sturgis, S. D. Some of the negro soldiers went on a rampage similar to that at Brownsville, Tex., fend one of their number killed a citi ren. In that case, however, the citi­ zens took the matter in their own hands, forced the troopers tinder pain of death to disclose the name of the man who did the killing and thep took him out and lynehed him,

TUESDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1906. THOUSANDS OF CHILD^AL&VES. Northern Capital Blamed for CondU tions In South. New York,' Dec. 4.—That there are thousands of child slaves, mostly little girls, working in the textile mills of the South and theft Northern capital ts to blame for this condition, was the declaration of Mrs. Frederick Na­ than of the Consumers' league, who addressed an audience of about 1,500 persons at the first winter session of the "people's forum" in the New Rochelle theater. "The capital of the country is liter­ ally devouring little children," said Mrs. Nathan. "When one of the negro slaves of the South died he had to be replaced, but these child slaves work where the dust chokes them tod gives them tuberculosis and nobody cares. Many of them die, but there are al­ ways others. "At a. time'When these little chil­ dren should nestling in- their beds they are aroused by the shrill sound of the factory whistle and compelled to go to work that lasts, sometimes, far into the night Others are em­ ployed all night and when morning comes they may be found lying around the factory on benches because they are too worn out to go home for break­ fast." TRIAL PROGRESSES SLOWLY DEFENSE REPEATEDLY OBJECTS TO TESTIMONY IN 8WEA CASE AT CHICAGO. Chicago, Dec. 4.—Albert Young, the former president of the Teamsters' I union and the present head of the United Teamsters of America, was again called to the stand when the trial of Cornelius P. Shea, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, was resumed. The attorneys for the defense en­ tered vehement protests to nearly every answer given by Young to the questions of Assistant State's Attor­ ney Miller and the trial progressed slowly. The state at the opening of the session sought to prove in a gen­ eral way through Young conversations said to have taken place between Shea and pickets placed by the Teamsters' union. The attorneys for the defense Insisted that the witness should con­ fine himself to specific Instances and the state declared that a general ex­ amination was legal and proper. Judge Ball ruled that the witness must des­ ignate the time and place of all con­ versations and if possible^ make elpar the Identity of all persons taking part in the conversations. Young was asked if he 'ftad dorie picket duty himself and replied: "Yes, I did." rij "Do you remember,, an ,Qccn£renQjB that took place during the strike near the Washington street tunnel?" "I do." vi. "Who was there at the time?" "Jerry McCarthy, business agent of the Truck Drivers', union, and myself." "What happened there?" "I saw a man hit a driver employed by Franklin MacVeagh & Co. and knock him down. When the man got up I hit him myself." The witness declared that the pick­ ets stationed around the stores where strikes had been declared made fre­ quent reports to President Shea and that he personally heard many of them. 

SAID TO BE AGAINST JAPS. Metcalfs Report on San Francisco Incident. San Francisco, Dec. 4.—The Call says: School Director D. H. Oliver states that. Secretary Metcalf, before his de­ parture for Washington, told school directors that he believed they were clearly within their rights in estab­ lishing a separate school for Japanese pupils. This would tend to correct the impression that Secretary Metcalf had decided to favor the Japanese In his report to the president. The sec­ retary's report, it may be assumed, will conform to his assurances to the school board. Attorneys versed in international law believe that the treaty between Japan and America in no way coverB the crisis at issue and the best that the United States can do for the Island empire is to institute a test in the federal courts, which has already been done. That the matter will be taken to the supreme court for decision is now quite evident and if it is decided there that the Japanese are not Mongolians, a contention raised to divert the enforcement of the law re­ quiring that race to be taught in sep­ arate schools, it is now quite certain a new law will be passed by the leg­ islature next session to keep the Japa­ nese out of schools in which Caucas »i*e taneht.
