FOLLOWING is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate and house at the beginning of the Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress—Since 1 last had the privilege of addressing you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea, which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope until it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of the globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, has altered the whole face of international affairs, and now presents a prospect of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upon to attempt before. The president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time comes for readjustment and recuperation this country will be of infinite service. Re ferring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has Inspired us throughout the whole life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mex ico by the course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in iter own hands. But we have at least proved that we will _not take_ advan- O E THE

Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country Comes From Within Our Bor ders. trine is, "That government is or ought to be instituted for the common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or community that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is capable of producing the greatest de gree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration. ui~d that when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community hath an indubitable, inalienable and indefeasible right to reform, alter or abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in the radical but nec essary process. We will aid and be friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Eeonomie Adjustments Inevitable With* in the Next Generation. The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op erating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in interna tional affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as in a very deep and true sense a unit in world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to gether, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of hos tile rivalries united in spirit and pur pose, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. The president calls attention to the meeting in Washington recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment is, inevitable in the ne^t gen eration. No one who really comprehends the spirit of the great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fail to per ceive that their passion is for peace, their genius best displayed ih the prac tice of the arts of peace. Great democ racies are not belligerent They do not 'ppk or desire war. Their thonght's of individual liberty and of the free labor that supports life and the un censored thought that quickens it. Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to pur princi ples. But just because we demand un molested development and the undis tnrbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter tt may come, the aggression we ourselves will not practice. We Insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development We do more than that We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for Individual liberty and free national development to the Inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wher ever there Is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed It as important that our neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be have set America aside as a whole for the new of Independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of assertlng the rlghts of a peo ple against aggression* And we are as fiercely Jealous of .coercive or dicta torial power within oar own nation as of aggression from without We will not maintain a. standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary In tlmee of peace aa In times of war.
