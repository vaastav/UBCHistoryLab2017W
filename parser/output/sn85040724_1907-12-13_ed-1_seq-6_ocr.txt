NO TARIFF CHANGES NOW. Leave Schedules Alone Until After Elec tion —Federal Control of Inter state Corporations. TAKES WHACK AT INJUNCTIONS. WASHINGTON, D. C., Deo. 3. While urging upon Congress the neces sity or immediate action regarding cur rency legislation. President Roosevelt does not commit himself and the admin istration to any one plan of action in his annual message read to the Senate and House ox Representatives today. Rather he suggests that something must he done at once to solve the problem, hut leaves it entirely to Congress to de vise the ways and means. Need More Elastic Currency. “We need a greater elasticity in our currency; provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency,” says the President. “There must always he tin most rigid examination by the national authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emer gency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emergency issue must he based on adequate securities approved by the government, and must he issued under a heavy lax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its re tirement as the demand fell off. It is worth investigating to determine wheth i Government to Pay L Campaign Expenses. ([ 

WASHINGTON, D. C., Dec. 3.-[Spe- f clnl.]—A novel feature of the Presi- A dent’s message is his recommendations ) • regarding campaign expenses for ( presidential eloetions. Ho says; j “Under our form of government voting I is not merely a right but a duty, and, > moreover, a fundamental and necessary < ) duty if a man is to be a good citizen. N It is well to provide that corporations ) shall not contribute to presidential or ( national campaigns, and furthermore to i 'i provide for the publication of both con- / i 1 trlbutlons and expenditures. There is, A however, always danger of laws of this > kind, which from their very nature are ( difficult of enforcement; the danger be- j / ing lest they he obeyed only by the ) I(| honest, and disobeyed by the un- ( I S scrupulous, so as lo act only as a pen j ) ally upon honest men. Moreover, no / J such law would hamper an unscrupulous < / man of unlimited means from buying ) his own way into office.

Must Cease Speculative Folly. “Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guar antee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than it ecu guarantee an individual against the results of his extravagance. When an individual mortgages his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy men. or men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolish ly eager to become such, indulge in reck less speculation—especially if it is ac companied by dishonesty—they jeopardize not only their own future but the fu ture of all their in*ocent fellow citi zens, for thc> expose the whole b.isines.s community to panic and distress.’’ No Reason to Hoard Money. The President points out that no na tion has greater resources than ours and the citizens of no nation possess greater industry aud industrial ability. He continues: “In no nation are the fun damental business conditions sounder than in ours at this very moment; and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keep ing it in sound hanks: for it is such hoarding that is the immediate occasion of money stringency. Moreover, as a rule, the business of our people is con ducted with honesty and probity, and this applies alike to farms and factories, to railroads and hanks, to all our le gitimate commercial enterprises.

Unflinching perseverance in war against successful dishonesty. There must be no halt in the course re garding interstate commerce which the nation has elected to pursue. There should be either a national incorporation act or a law licensing interstate railway companies. The interstate commerce commission should be given power to pass upon the future issues of railway securities. Ample means should be pro vided to enable the commission to make a physical valuation of railroads. Roads should be allowed to enter into agree ments. There should be additional legislation looking to the proper control of the great business concerns engaged in interstate business, this control to be exercised for their own benefit aud prosperity no less than for the protection of investors and of the general public. Business combina tions are necessary and it is as idle to desire to put an end to all corporations, to ail big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to combinations of labor. It is profoundly immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public mo rality, that really puts a premium upon public immorality, by undertaking to for bid honest men from doing what must be done under modern business condi tions, so that the law itself provides that its own infraction must be the condition precedent upon business success. The antitrust law should be made more efficient and more in harmony with act ual conditions. It should be so amended us to forbid only the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an incident of, a grant of sup ervisory power to the government over these big concerns engaged in interstate business. This should be accompanied by provision for the compulsory publica tion of accounts and the subjection of books and papers to the inspection of the government ofiiciaks. The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injustice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public. A combination should not be tolerated if it abuse the power acquired by combination to the public detriment. No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstate commerce that is formed for the purpose of, or whose operations create, a monopoly or general control of the production, sale, or dis tribution of any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of general use and necessity. Congress has the power to charter cor porations to engage in interstate and for eign commerce, and a general law’ can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corporations could take out fed eral charters and new federal corpora tions could be created. An essential provision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some fed eral board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an misdeeds with irapnity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men are business men of great sagacity and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where the conditions are such that they are without supervision or control and at first without effective check from public opin ion, they delude many innocent people into making investments or embarking in kinds of business that are really un sound When the misdeeds of these suc cessfully dishonest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it occurs; and, naturally, when it does occur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both wise and proper to endeavor so far as pos sible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ultimate causes of the suffering, and, as a means to this end. where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental policies; but surely there can be no such differences as to the need of unflinching perseverance in the war against successful dishonesty.” Wants Federal Control. The President insists that federal con trol of all corporations doing an inter state business is necessary and that it would benefit alike the corporations and the public, lie wants the Sherman anti trust law strengthened and changed so that while it will permit certain business combinations, which are right and prop er. it will not allow harmful trusts to exist. He recognizes that certain com binations and merging of vast corpora tions are proper and urges that the act be so amended that this can be law fully accomplished. He sayo the rail roads should welcome federal control as it will save them from a multitude of conflicting laws passed by the various states. Leave the Tariff Alone. This being a presidential year, Mr. Roosevelt does not think that the tariff ought to bo touched until after election. He says; This country is definitely committed to S the protective system and any effort to | uproot it could not but cause widespread j industrial disaster. In other words, the i principle of the present tariff law could i not with wisdom be changed. But in a j country of such phenomenal growth as | ours it.is probably well that every dozen j years of so the tariff laws should be care -1 fully scrutinized so as to see that no ex | cessive or improper benefits are cou j ferred thereby, that proper revenue is provided, and that our foreign trade is encouraged. There must be as a : minimum a tariff which will not only S allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of production i here and abroad; that is, the difference in | the labor cost here and abroad, for the ; well-being of tlie wake-worker must ever | be a cardinal point of American policy. I Ihe question should be approached pure ! ly from a business standpoint; both the j time and the manner of the change being j such as to arouse the minimum of agita- I thui and disturbance in the business world, and to give the least play for sel fish and factional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of changes represents the pub lic good. This means that the subject cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the

Immediate action to currency laws is ; necessary. A greater elasticity in our currency is needed. Provision should be | made tor au emergency currency. The | emergency issue should be made with an effective guarauty, and upon condi tions carefully prescribed by the gov ernment. Such emergency issue must be based ou adequate securities approved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its re- , tirement as the demand fell off. It is ; worth investigating to determine whether j officers and directors of national banks ] should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should be sub ject to the same supervision as banks. Nothing should be done with the tariff this session in view of the coming presi i deiitial election. After the election cer ! tain schedules should be reduced. ; Waen the national tax system is re -1 vised, provision should be made for an ! income and inheritance tax. j Abuse in issuing injunctions in labor 1 disputes must cease. National inspection of railroads, along the lines of steamboat inspection, should be provided so as to prevent numerous wrecks.

Law should j be such that payment of damages to 1 injured workmen should be automatic instead of being a matter of lawsuits. Advocates extension of eight-hour leg islation. Recommends compulsory investigation by the government of all industrial dis putes. Legislation regulating the employment of women and children is needed. Development of our natural water ways. Public land laws should be strength ened to prevent fraud and to punish “grabbers.” Natural resources must be protected. Tariff on forest products should be re moved. especially on wood pulp. Recommends postal savings bank sys tem. Parcel post system should be extended. Bureau of mines should be created.

Four new battleships are needed this year. This country should make a liberal exhibit at the Japanese fair to be held in 1912. year preceding a presidential election, because as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such election.” Income and Inheritance Taxes. The President repeats his recommenda tions of last year for national inherit ance and income taxes. He thinks that when our system of taxes is revised, Congress should adopt Ids suggestions. Lie points out that the cry of a few years ago that wealthy offenders escaped the penalty of the law, can not be raised now as the department of justice “has been as prompt to proceed against the wealthiest malefactor whose crime was one of greed and cunning as to proceed against the agitator who incites to brutal violence. Everything that can be done under the existing law, ai'd with the existing state of public opinion, which so profoundly influences both the courts and juries, has been done.” Too Many Unjust Injunctions. Regarding injunctions, the President says: “Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in the minds of those who feel that their rights are being invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues likewise to grow. Much of the attack on the use of the process of in junction is wholly without warrant; but I am constrained to express the belief that for some of it there is warrant. This question is becoming more and more oue of prime importance, and un less the courts will themselves deal with it in effective manner, it is certain ulti mately to demand some form of legisla tive action. It would be most unfortu nate for our social welfare if we should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that they had just cause for regarding our courts with hostility. I earnestly commend to the attention of the Congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions and protect those rights which from time to time it unwarrantably invades. Moreover, dis content is often expressed with the use of the process of injunction by the courts, not only in labor disputes, but where state laws are concerned. I re frain from discussion of this question as I am informed that it will soon receive the consideration of the supreme court. “The federal courts must of course de cide ultimately what are the respective spheres of state and nation in connection with any law. state or national, and they must decide definitely and finally in matters affecting individual citizens, not only as to the rights and wrongs of labor but as to the rights and wrongs of capi tal; and the national government must always see that the decision of the court is put into effect. The process of injunc tion is an essential adjunct of the courts doing its work well and as preventive measures are always better than re medial. the wise use of this process is from every standpoint commendable But where it is recklessly or unnecessar ily used,, the abuse should be censured, above all by the very men who are prop erly anxious to prevent any effort to shear the courts of this necessary power. The court’s decision must be final: the protest is only against the conduct of individual judges in needlessly anticipat ing such final decisu a, or in the tyranni cal use of what is nominally a temporary TO

Many of the recommendations made in his message of 19015 are repeated in the the message read today. MR.

Struggle with Renewed Energy Hoping to Explore Balance of Entries at Fayette City. PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec. 3. —Twenty-five of the miners caught by an explosion of fire damp Sunday night in the Naomi mine of the United Coal company, located near Fayette City, had been reached by the rescuers this morning. All were dead and charred almost beyond recognition. The rescuers are now nearing the end of the workings and they have found no sign of liie anywhere. In the opinion taf the owners of the mine few if any more victims will be found, but among miners and others in the village there is a firm belief that the total number of victims is between forty and fifty. After finding eleven bodies near the twenty-ninth entry shortly before mid night, the rescuers went to work with re newed energy to explore the remaining seven entries. There are thirty-six entries in all, and until the last of these has been searched, the full extent of the dis aster will not be known. Because of the accumulation of gas, the work of rescue in the remote sections of the mine is greatly impeded. A second explosion is a constant men ace and every precaution is being taken to avert such a catastrophe. Scores of frenzied women c instantly surround the pit mouth and the special detail of officers have much trouble in keeping them from interfering with the work of the rescuers. The cause of I lie explosion has not yet been ascertained. One theory is that it resulted from the explosion of black damp in an unused entry when a miner carrying an open lamp crossed the “dead line.” Another is that a spark from the trolly line over which cars are hauled from the workings to the mouth of the shaft ignited a pocket of gas in the mine.

MADISON, Wis., Dec. 7.—[Special.] Believing that the conditions of caring for the Indians on the Oneida reservation by the government should be improved, and inspired with a zeal that their fu ture lies in education, Miss Laura M. Cornelius, an Indian girl, whose home is in Seymour, is at the university as a junior, preparing for her life’s work. “1 am here at Wisconsin to interest the yell known professors of sociology at the pniversity in the settlement of the Oneida/’ paid Miss Cornelius, in dis cussing her plans. “We need an agricul tural experiment station, organization of industry, and a township organization. Our school system needs reorganization. Our education of the children is being reduced to institutionalism; the work is not being done by real teachers. The superintendents generally are not college bred men, a condition which unfortunate ly exists at most of the Indian reserva tions. Start with Oneidas. “I intend to begin at the Oneida reser vation, where I am the most familiar with conditions, and what I accomplish there I shall repeat wherever Indians have land tenure. I am neither a mis sionary nor a philanthropist. I like any constructive work, and it because of this fact, together with the feeling in me that I should advance the interests of my people, that I have begun this task. “The Indian reservation system is rank to the core. People never can ex pect any civilization to come from it. 1 would reorganize them, not as reser vations. but as modified bodies politic, a compromise between the reservation and American citizenship. I would not grant the Indians complete citizenship because they must come prepared to re ceive it: otherwise they will lose what they have. Hopes for Dairy Farms. “As for the organization of industry which 1 consider the most essential, I hope to see a great dairy industry built up at the Oneida reservation and 1 ex pect the co-operation of the university in my efforts to firmly establish such an industry. “By sending settlement workers among the Indians, giving lantern slide lectures on agriculture and dairy sub jects and generally trying to interest them in the better life. I believe that an organization of industry may be effected at the Oneida reservation in a short time. In Need of Money. “The third step which I advocate to improve conditions is the establishment of local banks at each of the Indian reservations, so that money may be placed in circulation, as the Indian na tions need money badly. My idea is to secure the consent of the government to have the principal of the Indian land fund paid over to the banks. Up to this time only the interest on the fund has been paid out.
