With the tariff as n issue, the Rever end Burchard and his three R's will not be worth three cents a, ton next year. Three-fourths of the states will rote for Cleveland. It is refreshing to readjthe proposition of the monopolists, to extravagantly ex pend all of the surplus in pensions, for tifications and the like. It will ease the mind of the man who, though half starved, obliged to pay out more than his earnings for taxes to know that It is being donated to'other people,. Hhe Wanted the Karlk. Chicago society has been regaled with the developments of the divorce suit brought by a Mrs. Leslie Carter on the ground, among others, that her husband refused to provide ber with money suffi cient to gratify her luxurious wants. Her husband seems to have been moder ately generous with her, but she evident ly "wanted the earth,"so to sneak. The following expense account ap peared for the years 1882345: In 1883 her husband paid Dills for her to the amount of $17,140 06; in 1884, 19.710, 03; and.in I885,'t15,80l 41. Traveling and hotel expenses, $4,088 25; personal apparel, $3,818.46; pair of horses, f 750; pocket money, $6.U8; jewelrv, $055 67; besides $6.38 for household expenses largely incidental to her social life. In 1884 she had $:t.406 for her personal ap parel, $1,689 for 1 jewelry .hotel bills ex ceeding, 800,'nod traveling expenses to the amount of over $2 400. In 1885 she bad 4or traveling expense! over $6,300; for personal apparel, $1,778; for jew elry, $1,079, and for general expenses, $1,088. An allowance that would enable i woman to muke such expenditures as these ought to satisfy almost anybody. but it did not satisfy Mrs. Leslie Carter Sue is a handsome woman, and a gay woman. She flitted from poinlto point. visited watering placeWn this country, made tours to Europe, "flirted" some with the men, and generally had a good time. Finally her doting husband, una ble longer to staud the drain on bis re sources, called a halt, and Mrs. Leslie Carter, who appears to think that the sole mission of a wife is to absorb her huslwud's earnings, flew to a divorce court and demanded a dissolution of the marital partnership. The skeleton inthe Carter closet is not a new one. It will be found in every household where the wife setsup for her idols dress, fashionable society, travel and "flirtation." For Mtate Officer.

Point! of the Bill That Will jt Loom th Winds In ConffreMt the AdmlnUtmtton Tariff Proposition The Commotion Started In the Senate Fairehl Id to Bigg Ins Capital Miscellany. Washington City, Dec, SO. The adminis tration tariff bill, which will go before the ways and means committee with the indorse moot of Speaker Carlisle after the holiday recess, as the basis of revenue reform, coo templates a redaction of $62,000,000 annual revenue. Of this amount $50,000,000 is to come from redactions of duties, chiefly on manufactures, and $12,000,000 from adding wool, salt, lomher. coal, etc, to the free list The bill aims at a very extensive revision of present methods of administering the tariff law and at remedying inconsistencies and in equalities in the law, as well as a general re duction of the rate of tariff taxes. It proposes thesubstitution of specific for ad valorem rates, where toe latter are diftVult of enforcement. In the chemical, earthen, and glassware schedules numerous reductions are proposed. In metals material reductions on iron and steel are recommended. In the wool and woolen schedule, raw wool being made free, tberates on woolen fabrics are so reduced as ts takeaway about $10, 00,000 upon the basis of last year'B importations. Inconsistencies as to rates on worsted and woolen cloths are corrected, and here occur some of the most Important changes proposed in the bill The bill embraces the schedules prepared for congress last winter by Secretary Fairchild, substituting specific for ad valorem duties on silks, gloves and embroideries. It also in cludes the Hewitt plan for reform of the cus toms administrative service, with some changes and additions suggested by treasury experience since Hewitt's bill was first intro duced. The senate finance committee has author ized Allison to report to the senate the bill compiled by the special committee of under valuations, which has for two years been studying the subject of reform of the cus toms administrative law1, relating to the ap praisemenbi of imported merchandise. The bill contains 2. sections and repeals all other laws as to appraisements and cus tom ad m in istra lion. It does away with merchant appraisers, and with the right of importers to appeal from reap apraisements to the courts, or the secretary of the treasury. It provides for nine gen eral appraisers at salaries of .$5,000, to whom are given the ' power of final decision m all questions of classification and appraisement The duties ofcustoms officers and the require ments as to invoices, entries, etc., are all more clearly defined. Penalties for offering or accepting bribes and for attempted evasions of duty are made more Severn It is provided that invoices must give the actual market value of imported merchandise at the place of purchase or production. Ap praising officers are authorized to use every proper means to ascertain the correctness of invoices, and in cases of undervaluation to the extent of 5 per cent penalties will at tach, and' forfeiture in cases of 30 par cent undervaluation, i he burden ox proof is placed upon the importers instead of cus toms officers in cases of apparent fraud. The system of damage allowances is wholly abol ished. Coverings m which merchandise is imported are to be included in estimating the valne upon which doty is assessed. The bonded warehouse system is not in any way changed by the bill. Fees and oaths are done away with as far as possible. THE

INTERNATIONAL MIIL KILRAIN SURPRISES THE STOCKY CHAMPION OF ENGLAND. A Fight for Two and m Half Hoars, In Which the American Showed Jnls Met tle and Did Himself Proud Both Men Game for 100 Rounds, Bat Darkness Stops the Fight and They Call Et a Draw. London. Dec. 20. The great international battle between Smith and Kilrain was per haps the gamest on record, and the conduct of the spectators and all interested parties was most exemplary throughout St Pierre Island, near Vernon, where tbe fight oo- JAKB KILRAIN. curred, is beyond the reach of the Fren ch gend'armes, and completely isolated, even from telegraph st ations. Some of the press representatives employed pigeons for the pur pose of communication and the first meagre announcement of the result reached London by way of Vernon, all of the reporters making a break for Paris as soon as the fight was over in order to avail themselves of the telegraphic facilities. In the first and second rounds Smith forced tbe figh ting. The ex changes were rapid and promptly met on both sides. During the ne xt few rounds Kil rain displayed splendid judgment, landing bis blows in a style very effective. Smith fought for tbe face with his left and at the same time endeavored to reach - Kilraiu's body with his right hut usually without effect The sixth round was in Smith's favor and the betting was 4 and 5 to 5 on him, with no takers. The seventh round was a repetition of the sixth and the eighth shewed no dif ference, both men working hard. There was considerable wrestling, which was de precated by the spectators. In these bouts Kilrain invariably had the best of the clinches. Round after round now followed, Kilrain holding his own, but getting no advantage, and Smith generally leading with his right and stopping Kih-ain's counters. Kilrain did JEM SMITH. the most damage with bis right but always before much harm bar been done tile i closed and fell together. In the eighteenth round Kilrain knocked Smith clean off his legs with a right-hander. and raised a lump on his ear as big as an egg. After this Kilrain seemed to be Jess dis tressed than Smith, who continued his en deavors to force the pace. In the twentieth round Smith made a desperate effort to put Kilrain on the defensive, bnt was unable to establish a lead. By this time Kilrain's right eye was closed and smith's left ear was in creasing in size. In the twenty -second round Smith was badly punished, Kilrain finishing the round bv falling heavily upon him. In the twenty-fifth round Smith was very weak and sparred for wind to the end of the round. In the thirtieth round Smith's condition was much improved, and be fought desperately. Charley Mitchell appealed to tbe referee to allow a foul against Baldock, one of Smith's seconds, for gouging Kilrain while separating tbemen at the end of the thirty- first round, but the ruisree would not al low it Tbe next four rounds were in Smith's favor, and then matters became equal again. The weather was cold and very trying to tbe men. Kilrain's right eye was closed, but Smith's swelled ear burst and relieved him of the acute pain it had caused him. Smith rallied in tbe thirty -sixth round. though a minute before he bad looked like a sure loser. The seconds now busied them selves with both men and so handled them that at the fortieth round both were stronger, though Kilrain was tbe better of the two. Indeed, it soon became apparent to Smith that be was, as be found himself obliged to fall frequently to avoid tbe pun ishment the American was beginning to deal out to bun. 1 be odds now veered tu favor of Kilrain, though in tbe forty-fifth both men grew weak again. They fought deter minedly, however, but there was more clos ing and wrestltfig than fighting. From this point to tbe ninetieth round the friends of Smith did not conceal their anx iety. Kilrain held a very decided advan tage, and knocked Smith down three times, though Smith returned the compliment ounce. One hundred rounds were fought in two hours and twenty minutes. Both men were still strong in the legs, but the light of day was fast fading and the cold increased. Smith's seconds repeatedly urged the referee to stop tbe fight claiming that the time keepers could not see their watches, and the referee himself could not see whether a fool occurred or not Smith appeared to im prove in the last six rounds, but Kilrain kept on in hn old style, cool, collected and wary. At the l(6th and last round both men wexe fighting as fast as at tbe start, but as it was now quite dark Referee Atkinson ordered the fight adjourned until Tuesday, amid the cheers of tbe spectators. .Later Hmith and Kilrain met on board the steamer and agreed to call the fight a draw, as both wished to fight Sullivan and a resumption of the battle would debar the loser from chal lenging the Boston fighter. Coanterparts of the colors worn by both- men were largely worn bv the rival bands of spectators. The colors of Kilrain bore tbe stars and stripes. the harp of Ireland and a portrait of him self. Smith's colors were a portrait of him self and the royal standard surmounted by the typical sporting pelican. New York. Dec. 30.

She was rich, having inherited considerable money from ner father, who was one of the origi nal makers of papar collars. After her divorce she came back to Troy and married CrandelL her former husband's friend. He was a talL powerful man, and quite hand some. He soon began to spend his wife's money freely, and then they quarreled. Mrs. Crandeirs mother, Mrs. Stone, who was also wealthy, sided with her daughter. Cran- dell's wife shut off his money allowance and be could not get whisky, and it is supposed that his enforced temperance made him crazy. He circulated stories detrimental to his wife's character, and he supposed she was going to get a divorce from him. bile the family were at breakfast Mon day he learned that his wife and her daugh ter were going to Troy. "Now is my time," he said, and be drew a revolver and shot Miss Bulkley. She fell dead. Then he shot Mrs. Stone, and she ran from tbe house. He followed her to the door and fired another shot, and she fell dead in the snow. Mrs. Ellis, a sister of Mrs. Stone, escaped from the room, a shot aimed at her failing to hit the mark. Crandell then puttwo shots into his wife's body near the groin, but she was alive Monday evemug. He then went into the cupola of the house and fired two bullets into his own breast killing himself. During the firing he stopped to reload the revolver. It was an old-fashioned weapon, and carried a ball weighing nearly two ounces.
