That |s bad, but the theft was doubtless the result of bablts formed by the boy The boy Is said to have committed the theft about 5 o'clock In the' morning. Possibly the boy had been out al> nigbt. The theft indicates that. Would it not bo wise for parents to pee to it that the children arc at home gt night? They owe that duty to their 0htlc|ren. m - .Empty coal cars, standing on side tracks at the coal mines is evidence! pf .Democratic "prosperity." The I president made no allusion to these empty cars in his message. It may be possible that be really doeB not hnow business conditions. The message indicates as much 'or if he does know his ideas of business prosperity are different front those who would like to work and see business good like it used to be. ':Idle cars on sidetracks at coal milnes in the region can be seen IV... t)very day and the operator counts, himself lucky If he sees a chance to load them soon. A different condi tion used to prevail in this region ,.y and there was daily complaint of a shortage of cars. Now there is no Occasion to load cars and, of course, oars are not In demand. This change in conditions-should impress [ itself on every mining community y yrhore the empty, standing'cars are. Jy, There is apolitical lessou to learn &j>mthe.-present situation. Not only ' , (ioal miners suffer. The merchant jj?f - feels, it,, too. |'S J ' Prodding the People, 5* John J. Cornwell, well known v ; . Domooratic editor and legislator, casta aside partisanship and very - - frankly admits that the Democratic party has done an unpopular thing in imposing '"war" taxes ot> the people. fS He declares that the party should better look out and It is an unwise s thing to prod the people. Editor Cornwall says in the current number ffii of the Hampshire Review: |te . Much confusion and trouble were jjt-'.Y. occasioned in the large towns and |rv cities from inability,on the part of ;;* * the public to procure the "war tax" ?. stamps before the law became effectHK1 ,'ivo. Shippers bver railroad and express lines suffered the greatest inconvenience, asv each freight bill requires a stamp. The revenue department'in Washington had failed to furnish a sufficient supply, the bureau of engraving and printing having 7 been taxed to its limit in getting them .. put. It is a' great pity the president and Congress could not have devised gpme way for raising the additional revenue without resorting to a stamp ' tax, the means used in actual war time. It is bound to prove very un.' popular because of the trouble, rather than, the expense, . Too many governmental activities as against the In dividual citizens will create a resentment no political party ca,n withstand. As long as government restrictions and regulations are confuted to corporations It is ail well and good but when Uncle Sam begins ttf, prod the citizen?look out. ' CormveU on Davis, ' In view of the fact that the following editorial was penned by John J. Cornwell, erstwhile Democratic leader and Idol In this slate, it Is What the Telegram calls rich: "We have some very distressing irfiuro fp/ttn W ncTitnnrf ati Wn rllolibo & f to make It public but Inasmuch as It -to a matter of public moment, we re^ It as our solemn duty to do It. ? It.relates to the Hon. John W. Davis, .formerly the brilliant representative Wj&.v -from the First congressional district TVest Virginia, perhaps, never had ' a more brilliant representative in K);, Congress than John Davis. And popHL' , ular? Everybody liked. John Davis. Est . He was the very life of every gatbering he attended. He could "go gfciy otlt with the hoys" and engine in their Innocent pastimes and bv Just *. as much at ease as when attending a Presbyterian prayer meeting. He p.,. Jcaew everybody and had a friendly f/ . word and a cheerful greeting for R?v-' every person he met, old or young. rich or poor. 'Always'handsome of I face and dignjflpfj of hearing he was i no dude,'our John Davis was not. i No wonder he had- friends galore : and could get elected frgm a Repub- ] lican district. < But there seems to have come a > change since he left us and became i a-high muck-a-muck in the national ' administration, at Washington. We ' did not think the appointment of So- ' ljcitor General of the United States I would go to' bis head. But it has, < evidently. We have the word of J Charles P. Light for it, and who 1 would dare question Charley Light's J word? John Davis, according to Charley Lfght, has taken to wearing a silk hat?plqg, they call It down there?a long tall coat, with braid I on It and carries a cane. Now, we 1 .could forgive him ir he walked with J the stick but he actually allows it t to dangle from his left arm. Worse \ yet, he has been knowp to pass peo- t pie on tbe street without as much as 1 saying "good morning" to thep. i We realize that this news will dis- 1 tress John Davis's other West Virr s glnlq friends as it distresses us. Nq t wonder the Alfalfa Club threatens j to expel him. Good bye, John, you < evidently do not Intend to come back \ to'West Virginia. ^ t Fake Advertising. c In another. column Is an article a stating that W. A. Hcrscb, president t of the United Woolen Milis Company, i is onertng a reward for the arrest o" fake advertisers, and what the Parkcrsburg Dispatch-News says on the subject as follows applies here: Mr. "W. A. Hersch, president of the United Woolen Mills Company, has taken up the cudgel against fraudulent advertisers and fraudulent advertising. It has been his hobby for some time, and he has before agitated the subject, but he ,is now prepared to take definite steps to carry out his ideas. There it a law in Ohio, in whiph state Mr. Hersch operates extensively, and he has offered to the Advertisers' Club of Cincinnati the sum of |oD for each arrest?up to a total qf six?made of merchant tailor advertisers for specious advertising. He does not make conviction a condition. He will contribute so soon as the formal charge is uttered. The legal phase .of the action taken is only incidental sfr far as Parkers- t burg and West Virginia are concerned. , The moral is a strong ope.. ? Here we have an extensive user of ad- c vertising space, not only insistent that c his own advertising shall be compati-'. t ble with his merchandise hut willing t to contribute' to a propaganda to make t the high standard he sets for himself* r applicable to all. i While there have been few evl-j, dences of the need in Parkersburg, thei need nevertnolesB obtains, lor pro-;, i tectlng the consumer against false and fraudulent advertising matter^ j Honest values have been the rule t here and so far as Parkepsburg Is con- ( oerped no concern that employed'ad- t vertlsing for purposes of deceit could j long withstand. This is the general i rule. But there may be exceptions',. 1 and there Is, so long as there Is no law to the contrary, always.the po- 1 tentlal danger of exceptions. A law j that would compel the truth in advert , tlslng would not (jt(l?. provc.a.prolec tlon to those merchants 'wh'if dedicate 1 their advertising, to, the truth but It would be a lasting boon to the public.

Tilden. 1 The following short and simple i annals of the poor who became i richer are set down here not because i they nre startling stories of success, but just because they aru such ex- I laniples as the average person of am- ! bittop can hope to emulate success- | fully. tVe cannot all become enormously rich, but It Is possible for | most of us to acquire a competence i if we go about It in the] right way. i j Back in the eighties a young man 1 In northern New York state took 1 Horace Greeley's advice and went i west to grow up with the country, i He settled in what is now a prosper, < ous state in the Northwest, taking) hp there a free government,homestead claim oh the praries. As the t country became more settled land i values rose. Soon there was agita- 1 tion for the establishment of a state ' agricultural college In the nearby | county seat. In the meantime the young man had sold his farm at a < profit and with some of.the money went to Chicago to tnke a course in 1 pharmacy. He returned just iff ' time to secure-a position on the fac- I ulty of the new agricultural college. He is now head of a depart- t ment there and has become comfort- ; ably well off bfr saving from his in- i come and investing in farms' andjl farm mortgages in his neighborhood.! A Bohemian servant girl was mar.I' ried the other day. The comfortable1] 'and well furnished home Into which ] she and her husband moved is a , striking illustration of the thrift for ' which this element of our foreign- ] born population is noted. The little house in the country was built from the young man's savings and a large part of tbe furnishings cama-i from the young woman's' savings;! from her earnings of (en years as nil hous? servant. They were good things, too-^substantial furniture and reai silver. Industry and thrift will make this couple comfortably j well off In time. A "city dentist 32 years old moved bis family into a home of their own in the suburbs during the last , summer. He has been practicing his : (profession for almost ten years, but i the very substantial cash down pay1 ments he was able to make on his .home did not como entirely from his : savings, because quite a good deal of it was profit on a previous real! estate transaction.

Our >'ary Situation. ! It is very evident that the United states navy is not what it ought to b.e. t is true that world-pegce sentiment nay cause a hesitation on the part of he government to make the navy \ hat It ought to be. That same seniment was supposed to be possessing European nations Just beforethe war >wke out. It is fine sentiment and U realization would mark an ideal iununit in civilization, but it is not tere yet and may not come' for many -'eurs. ' In the meantime the United States can not afford to act as if{ vorld-ipeace actually exists! Our rather 'weak navy condition is imptyaslzed by Read Admiral Fletcher, commander of the Atlantic fleet, i man whose credibility, apd judgment ire not to be discounted, else the istion has made a grave mistake to intrust bim with the fleet. Admiral rletcber is in position to know and le is not a man to exaggerate. He oust/be taken at his word, despite >eace sentiment. iRear Admiral Fletcher has just tola lie House naval committee that the Jnited States navy is unprepared to :ope with the most powerful navy In he world. True, his words giye the nference that be regards the navy itrong, but the fact that there is at east-one stronger places the nation it disadvantage in case of war. He eatifled that "we are not prepared or the worst emergency that might irise to protect ourselves from the ;reatest force available. We would lave to greatly enlarge our fleet to irotect American interests against all lossible combinations against ub to :ontrol the ocean. We would have 0 take the offensive when we have 1 strong enough fleet." It js true one sees in his testimony i high degree of efficiency op the part >t our navy, but Admiral Fletcher! :ertalnly clearly conveys the* idea bat something great is lacking. He ells us that we are not fully pre>ared for the dcfcnslye if the greatest lavy comes against us and not at all eady to take the offensive, both of vhich would be necessary In case of var with at least one of the great latlons. ' Information such as Is given by Idmlral Fletcher ought to arouse acton. While no one wants war and ivery one will do his best to keep out >f it, there is sanity in being ready 'or it, whenever It comes. ' We can lot count on others taking care of us. IVc must do that ourselves. I THE

The president's message, delivered to the short term of the Sixty-third Congress yesterday, is in the president's usually clear English and discloses a literary style unimpaired by the nation-wide repudiation' of the. fine spun theories in promotion of which it had been heretofore employed. But the context of' the message discloses to a degree the sobering effect of the recent election; nowhere perhaps more than in the plea of economy. Whether the words in the president's message are as hollow and meaningless as in the platform on which he was elected remains to be seen. Surely, so far as the first half of his administration is I concerned the president is locking the stable after the horse is stolen.
