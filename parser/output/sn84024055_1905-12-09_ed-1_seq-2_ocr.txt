(Concluded from Page 1). resolved to dip his pen in gall and burning fire, and enter the arena, and to do battle unto death with that hy dnt&eaded monster slavery! Immediately after William Lloyd Garrison took upon himself a solemn vow of perpetual consecration to the slave; which was as follows:, "Before God and our country, we give our pledge that the liberation of the en slaved Africans shall always be up permost in our pursuits:" he Jeft Bos ton, and became a resident of Ben nington Vermont, where he assumed the edlforslhp of The Journal of the Times, and in closing his connection with that paper In 1829, he declared "that he had been Invited to occupy a broader field, and to engage In a high er enterprise: that field embraces the whole country that enterprise is in behalf of the slave population." On August 29th 1829, William Lloyd Garrison, bid farewell to his friends In Boston and set out for Baltimore where he was to assist Ben. Lundy In the editorship of his paper The Gen ius of Universal Emancipation, for the first two or three months they pro gressed very nicely; but at the end of that time, William Lloyd Gar rison bitterly assailed Francis Todd, a merchant of . Newburyport for allowing one of his vessels to sail for New Orleans, with a gang of seventy-five slaves; at the instance of Francis Todd, William Llyod Garrison was arrested for publishing a "gross and malicious libel," He was Indict ed by the Grand Jury for Baltimore, and one the first of March 1830, he was convicted, and not being able to pay his fine of fifty dollars and cost which amounted to almost one hund red dollars, he was committed to Jail for seven weeks, and Just forty-nine days after entering the Baltimore Jail as a priosner, Arthur Tappan, a rich New York, merchant sent him one hundred dollars to pay his fine, and he was willing to advance another hundred dollars for the further pur pose of reviving the paper which had suspended, but as William Lloyd Gar rison aptly, put it "he could knock a dozen subscribers off, while friend Lundy could secure one," and on March 5 1830 The Genius, went glimm ering through the dream of things that were no more, after his second fail ure in fiie Journalistic world he again returned to Boston, and on January 1, 1831, his new paper The Liberator made its first appearance in the world. It was an insignificant sheet, consisting of four columns to the page, measuring fourteen inches one way and nine and a quarter the other. Oliver Johnson, has left behind him a vivid dlscripllon of the office of The Liberator, "Its dingy walls: the small windows in the merchant's hall building bespattered with prin ter's Ink; the press standing In one corner; the composing stands oppo site; the long editorial and mailing table, covered with newspapers; the bed of the editor and publisher on the floor; a Negro boy who cleaned up the office his chief campion," and for the first two years every one connected with The Liberator which ran for thirty-five years, labored fourteen hours each day, subsisted mostly upon bread and milk, a few cakes, and a little fruit, which they obtained from a baker's shop near by. Within a few weeks alTer The Liber ator had blazed forth, within sight of Bunker Hill, where Crispus Attucks fell, it contained the following senti ments: T solicit no man's praise.' "I tear no man's censure." "Our trust for victory is solely in God. We may be personally defeated, but our principles, never I" "I am in earnest" T will not equivocate." "I will not retreat a single inch." "And I Will Be Heard." ' The Southern slave-holders and their sympathizers throughout the North suddenly became alarmed 'at his. bold or daring declarations, and the legislature of the state of Geor gia, offered a reward of "Ave thous and dollars "for the body of William Lloyd Garrison, dead or alive:" the head officials of many other Southern states were perfectly willing to follow suit, and while the people in the sorth were hotly daxnmorlBg for bis warm liberty loving blood, lie was 'at tacked by & sob composed of Christ ian gentlemen, and dragged through the' streets of Bottom with a rope around Ms aeckv and in order lb save his We, the Kayor of that city with tie aid of; oScers rescsed Mm from tke jBiob asd placed aim In jaiL wkea ho emerged from, prison he. was still cool -aad collected, aad ke costkuted to thunder fortfettkroagk the eeUwwff of The JJbearatot. la farer eMjaate- at, -- tlon. He. in conection with Oliver Johnson, Robert B. Hall, Arnold Buffum, Winiara J. Snelllng, John E. Fuller Moses Thatcher, Josh ua Coffin Stlllman, B. Newcomb, Benjamin C. Bacon, Isaac Khapp, and Henry K. Stockton, met one dis mal night in the African Baptist Church on Belknap street and organ ized the first Garrisonlan Society for the abolition of slavery in the United States; he and his apostolic band also founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society. The Liberator become the official organ of both bodies and its editor was chosen as their general agent, and chief lecture, and as such he raised his eloquent voice in behalf, of the slave in chains,.througbouf the North and In England, and he never faltered In his labors until slavery was no more. In December 1865 ho discontinued the publication of The Liberator, af ter the" completion of Its thirty-fifth volume, but until the day of his death which occurred at the home of his daughter Mrs. Henry Vlllard, In New York City may 24, 1879; he breathed words of hope and encouragement for the ex-slave, and among the last words spoken by the great apostle of liber ty were: "My country Is the world! my coun trymen are all mankind!" In celebrating the one hundreth an niversary of hlB birth, it is well to re fnember, that his breast was full of the milk of human kindness, that his love for his fellow creatures was as broad as the universe, that he -wore himself out in the service of his country, and that among the greatest champions of the rights of man, who have been sprawned upon the face of the earth, none of them were born greater than William Llyod Garrison. -e Mr. and Mrs. J.

GARRISONTHE NON-RESISTANT.- The. great apostle of abolition, Wil Han Lloyd Garrison, was born in Newburyport, Mass., December 10, 1805. The centenary of his birth is suitably marked by the publication of Ernest Grosby's notable book "Garri son the Non-Resistant" It Is a sympathetic sketch of Gar rison's career which considers sla very and the Civil War from an en tirely original point of view. In the opinion of the author President Lin coln made a radical mistake in under taking to coerce the seceding States, and the enthusiasm for the '"Union" of sections which hated each other he regards as Immoral in Itself and the source of prolific subsequent evils, in cluding the growth of the sentiments of Imperialism and militarism, to gether with the foundation of the trusts and the aggravation of the la bor problem. That the war failed to settle the race question Is obvious. If the "erring sisters" had been al lowed to go, slavery would, he thinks, have died a natural death, and the States would have reunited, the race question having been peacefully and genuinely solved. f Even, those who fall to accept this view of (history will find it Interest ing and full of suggestion and the acocunt of Garrison's life and the record of the personal observations of the author in the South of today are both vivid and entertaining.

Three-piece suits are always suitable Cor sightseeing. Thin silk blouses matching in color the rest of the cos tume are convenient in that they do not require constant laundering. Worn ! with fine lingerie sets, especially with the high cuffs so much in vogue, these blouses are very modish and becoming. A gun-metal mohair, with a raised fig ure, made a very stylish three-piece suit The skirt was box-plaited, and quite severely stitched, and the sim ple little Eton Jacket was relieved from plainness only by the beautiful lingerie collar which fell over the shoulders and down the front The Jacket was closed to the waist line with fastenings of black braid, and the folded girdle of the material was also fastened with braid ornaments. The blouse was of gun-metal radium silk, and was heart-shaped in front, with a gulmpe to match the coat col lar. The blouse was shirred on heavy cords on the shoulders, and was very full over the bust. The full sleeves were longer than the jacket sleeves, and were decorated with high white cuffs like the collar and gulmpe. Cashmere in light weight makes ex cellent gowns for traveling. Cash mere is the Ideal material for de signs using drapery, being very pliable, and yet very substantial. A lovely model in tobacco-brown was perhaps a little elaborate for a utility gown, but was too attractive to pass over. The skirt was full and plain, and was rather longer than walking gowns usu ally are. It barely escaped the ground, and would have to be held up wherever the ground was wet or dusty. The length was made necessary, from the aesthetic point of view, on account of the length of the redlngote, which. reached within, eight Inches of the hem. The skirt of the redlngote was full and plain, and all 'met in the front The points were- rounded, which gave a more open effect but the general effect was of a double skirt The blouse part of the redlngote wa3 full, -and rather loose in effect It opened in front over a short waist coat of brown satin elaborately em broidered in dull oriental colors, fas tened with small gold buttons. The blouse was broad, square revers of the satin, the embroidery partly covered with very loose meshed lace, coffee colored in hue. The full sleeves end ed at the elbow in cuffs, which matched the revers, and a foil of coffee-colored lace. The girdle wa3 of the cashmere, and was narrow rather than wide. FOR BATHING COSTUME.
