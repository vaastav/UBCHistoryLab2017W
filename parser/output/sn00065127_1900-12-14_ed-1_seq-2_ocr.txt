MANY CATTLE ARE DYING Cornstalk Poisoning Causing Heavy Loss in South Dakota. Cattle are dying all oyer South Dakota because of some hidden poison in ihe corn stalks. This year, however, there is a poison in some of the fields and catti turned into them die within ten hours alter having eaten of the stalks. The animals die in horrible agony, suddenly collapsing, dropping to the earth and suffering con vulsions of the most excruciating charac ter. In Yankton County a very large number of cattle have died from the effects of the poison. Four carloads of hides from cattle that have died from this poison were shipped from the town of Davis last wees. Young cattle are more often the victims, the older animals seeming to be able to detect and avoid the poison, or more able to detect it. Many farmers who have so far saved their herds have various reme dies which may or may hot be the cause of their good fortune, The most common preventive and the one easiest to put into practice is to give the cattle plenty of salt and water. The salt is only given to ex cite thirst, as the water in large quantities is supposed to be the means of preventing loss. VERDICT IN M'BRIDE CASE. Jury at Mitchell Awards the Plain tifT $700 Damages. The jury in the case of Bob McBride, who sued forty Mitchell citizens for $20,000 for the destruction of his newspaper office nearly five years ago, rendered a verdict for the plaintiff. The verdict awarded McBride damages to the amount of $700, the jury declining to give any exemplary damages, these being offset by the scurril ous articles in the sheet. Of the forty de fendants.at least ten were released by the jury from'the judgment returned, as they were not found to be associated in any way with the destruction of the newspaper. McBride is quoted as having said that he was satisfied with the verdict, which is also regaled as a complete vindication of the citizens who were associated in the destruction of the outfit. The amount awarded McBride is regarded as the hon est commercial value of the newspaper plant when it was burned, and the citizens were willing to pay that at any time, and never expected to escape it.
