Apparently the only means of escape from an Indefinite per iod of profitless operation is opened to some companies In this way. lgioallzing j Influenco of excessive freight rates is ' one factor which is forcing serious con sideration to be given to the possibilities | 1 of a national distribution through seat- i tered works . Distinct from the out standing plan to combine the number of l leading Independent companies, no loss J than three negotiations toward the con ' solldatlon of the plants are under way. Approximately a 50 per cent market continues in iron and steel with indica tions that this will taper off rather than ; expand during the closing weeks of the j ? year. November made a surprisingly good showing in pig ifon production, ? continuing the gain of two previous months to the extent of 180,901) tons. | The total for the month was 1,414,958 ; tons compared with 39,8-1 tons in Octo ber. This is a gain of 15.4 per cent. The number of furnaces In blast on the last day of November was 120, against' 9." on the corresponding dnte in October ' und 76 In Septemebr . The prinelpul feature of the pig iron market is the growing inquiry for first quarter metal. Oil field demands again stand out prom j inently in this week's business. Recent orders for pipe lines call f?>r approxl ' mntely 45,000 tons of steel. Railroad . buying offers encouragement because of Its sustained character, rKom 125.- . 000 to 150,000 tons of rails for the New York Central system has been allotted for 1922 delivery . Tho Texas l'aciflc I railroad has closed for 15,000 tons. New ? car and repair orders this week total 6,000 tons. The Iron Trade Review's weekly com posite index of 14 iron and steel pro ducts continues to slightly recede This week It is |1I4.29 as against $34.7! for November. $35.46 for October, and $23.29 for December, 1913. A leading Associa tion independent st-el-mnker is negotia ting In London for 25O.000 puis <,f steel scrap, ltrltleh contractors are unublo to obtain deliveries In Germany where the business first was'placed and have ! inquired in this country for 20,no<> tons of plates for the Bombay pipe line.

RECOMMENDS BUREAU TO DEVELOP AVIATION Washington, Dec. 7.?President aHrd Ing transmitted to congress today the ' annua! report o the national advisory : ~ commitete for aeronautics, with the re commendation that a bureau for the j regulation and development of air navl- ? gallon be cstabllshedi In the appoint-! Jiicnt of commissioners proposed by the commitete. There can be no doubt, the president i stated, in a message which accompanied j the report, "that the developments of ]. aviation will become of great import- ; anee for the purposes of commerce, as well as national defense. While the material progress la aircraft has been remarkable, the use has not as yet been extensively developed In America. This . has been due. In the main, to lack of 1 wise and necessary legislation. Avla-1 1 tion Is destined to make strides, and f ! Believe that America, Its birthplace, can J ! and should be foremost In its develop ? ment." , A bill to create such a bureau Is now ' pending before the house commerce i committee. ! ^i I . .
