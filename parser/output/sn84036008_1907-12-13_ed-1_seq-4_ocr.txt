Once again President Roosevelt has announced, in language more decided than ever, that he will not be a can didate for a third term and will posi tively not accept a nomination. Such an announcement was to be expected, in view of the movement which was gaining strength to force him to run. The friends of the president thought that his previous statements were so worded as to indicate that, if forced, he would take the nomination. But his statement of Thursday will con vince them of their errsr. The men who have studied' the president the hardest expected him to make the an nouncement that came. They real ized that he meant what he said three years ago, when he declared he would not be a candidate for a third term. and they knew that, once having made such a statement, he would not re tract it. They realized that he pos sesses a respect for American cus toms and appreciates the wisdom of American precedents, one of the most important of which is that no man shall serve as president more than eight years. The fact that the presi dent is highly patriotic should have been sufficient to have prevented the third term talk. Undoubtedly, there is no man in the nation better equipped to 1ll the of flee of chief executive. 'Theodore Roosevelt seems to have been created for the place. He has not only been one of the most popular, but one of the best presidents in the history of the nation. He has inaugurated great movements and great reforms. He is especially equipped to carry them through. But to say he is the only man in the nation who could carry them out would be doing a great in justice to the other great statesmen of 'the age. It will now be the duty of the repub lican party to choose a successor to Mr. Roosevelt. In the search that will be made it will be well to bear in mind that what is needed is another man of the Roosevelt type. Conditions de mand a man that will carry out the ideas and policies of the present ad ministration. Only' such a man can be elected president. But there are scores of them in the ranks of the party. The refusal of President Roosevelt to take a third term, which there i1 little doubt but what he could secure, shows the patriotism of the man and his respect for the traditions and precedents of the nation. He will re tire to private life, but will be suc ceeded by a man who will carry out his ideas and his policies. Who be will be is as yet impossible to pre dict. President Roosevelt will retire the nation's greatest citizen, but even in retirement the influence of his ideas and policies will undoubtedly be seen in the administration of the govern ment. In that.alone there will be greater glory than in being the first man to. break the precedent of the nation and serve more than two terms as presi dent. ·-------o------ 

LIGHT THE CROSSINGS. Travel on Twenty-seventh and Twenty-ninth streets across the North. ern Pacific is becoming so heavy at night that there is urgent need of bet ter lights on the crossings. It is more than probable that unless the cross ings are better lighted some accident will occur on one of them. In their present condition, with an are light no nearer than half a block away, it is exceedingly dangerous for women and children, and even for careless men, to cross the tracks after dark. Frequent ceomplaints have been made because of the dark condition of the crossings after night, and there have been several narrow escapes from accidents. It is almost impossi ble for a person to see a train back ing into the station, it is so dark. Lights are needed at both crossings, and they should be so placed that they will light the track for a considerable distance on both sides of the cross ings. :Either the city council or the rail road company, probably the former, should take steps to have such lights hung. Dark crossings in the heart of the city are entirely too dangerous, and they should be lighted. AN 

EXCELLENT 81OWING. The present county officials are to be congratulated on the excellent financial showing which will be made in their annual reports. As a result of threir careful and businesslike man a,·e~ nt of county affairs the indebt edea. of Yellowstone county has been de ea la the past year 24,261.86. chave just been com pleted show that the total indebted- I ness of the county November 30, 1906, was $101,169.06, and on November 30, 1907, it was $76,901.20. In the face of a remarkable increase in the business done by the county, and the cost of operation, this is a most -remarkable showing. It reduces the indebtedness of the county to a sum less than the indebtedness of almost any other county in the state. But it is probable that in the amount of delinquent taxes Yellow stone county will this year have the record for the whole northwest. There was less than 4 per cent. of the tax payers delinquent. The entire tax to be collected was $484,817.75, on an as sessment roll of $13,522,764. This certainly is a most- excellent showing. It proves that Yellowstone county is enjoying an era of wonder ful prosperity, despite the fact that there is said to be a great financial de pression and shortage of money throughout the country. It speaks well for the county and well for the offi cials who have succeeded in bringing about such a result. --------o------- 

DON'T GO TOO FAR. The spread of the anti-liquor senti ment throughout the country has been the means of electing to office many fanatics and radicals. The acts, as of ficials, of some such public servants have already been the cause of much comment throughout the nation, and it is probable that, unless the real friends of prohibition take some steps to restrain them, their cause will be considerably damaged. At this time it is well to urge upon the prohibition advocates in the coun try that it would be wise to be sane and to use horse sense in the enforce ment of the law. It was undoubtedly the intention of the legislators that passed Sunday closing and early clos ing laws to restrain the liquor traffic and it was never intended that legiti mate channels of business should be interfered with or that man should be prohibited from buying the necessities of life on Sunday and between mid night and early morning. But in New York, in some places in Kansas and in many other communi ties where they have recently been en acted laws or where some old law has been dug up for enforcement, radical officials have so interpreted it. In many places it has become impossible to purchase even medicines on Sun day. Such interpretation of the law will harm the cause of prohibition, and may eventually cause a reaction that will give the liquor traffic sway over territory where it is now prohibited. What is needed is the enforcement of the new laws in the spirit in which they were enacted. But if radicals are allowed to carry them to extremes, the prohibition movement will have to be saved from its friends. -------o---~---- . GOING TO INVESTIGATE. While there are probably some who think that President Roosevelt should have had a persogal investigation made of conditions in the Nevada gold nelds before he ordered federal troops there, he probably adopted the wisest course. At the most, only the violators of the law need fear. But all will probably unite in the latest move at Washington. President Roosevelt has instructed three of his most reliable lieutenants, Assistant Secretary Murray of the department of commerce and labor; Labor Com missioned Charles H. Neil and Herbert Knox Smith, commissioner of conpo rations, to go to Goldfield and inves tigate the trouble between the m.ue operators and the miners. 'rTh per sonnel of his committee or representa tives assures a fair and impartili in vestigation. They are men ski led in sociology and economics, and their in vestigation will undoubtedly be thor ough. Undoubtedly the president has adopted a wise course. When the re port of the investigators is made pub lic, the American people will for thle first time have an unbiased statement of the difficulties in the mining camps laid before them. Those who hav3 read the one-sided accounts of (ho troubles in Idaho, Colorado and now in Goldfield realize that the same condi tions have produced them all. The sending of soldiers into the disputed district will enable the authorities to preserve the peace, but will not ei:'mi nate the conditions that produce labor wars. An investigation, such as Messrs. Murray, Smith and Knox will make, will probably reveal the cause and enable the government to prevent labor disputes in the mining camps it the future. ----0--o---- 

BUTTE'S FOOTBALL TEAM. It is really hard to believe that the faculty of any high school would will ingly certify to the eligibility of a foot ball player who was really not eligible to play on the team, simply for the sake of winning a few games. Such an act would be entirely foreign to the spirit of amatuer athletics. Yet this appears to be what the faculty of the Butte high school did during the past football season, if the charges made by the Spokane football team are true. Spokane claims that Butte's two best players were not eligible to play under the rules governing contests among the high schools of the state and backs up the assertion with proof. If the statement of Spokane's high school athletic association is proved then it is probable that all the games Butte played the past year will be disallowed. That would .make Spo kane champion of the northwest and Billings champion of the state. After Butte had won the list of vic tories accredited to her team, it is too bad that such a charge should be made, but it should be sifted to the bottom. If it is found after careful in vestigation that the Butte school is guilty, then not only should her vic tories of the past season be disallow ed, but the other schools of the state should refuse to have further athletic relations with her. Butte must be punished if guilty and steps must be taken to keep high school athletic contests in Montana on the square. --------- JAPANESE SUPREMACY. The head of one of the largest Brit ish Oriental steamship companies, at the annual meeting of the company in London yesterday, declared that Japa nese competition has driven his com pany from the far east, and that Japa nese sailing companies have practical ly usurped the entire trade between Japan and Bombay. There is a note of warning in this statement to other foreign steamship companies doing business in the far east. It will certainly be but a short time till many of them will be in a like position. The Japanese are an aggressive lit tle people. They go after commerce with the same energy that they make war. Japanese are flocking into the countries in far eastern Asia, and Japanese influence in those countries will aid the Japanese navigators in securing the trade of the far east. At the present rate it will not De many years till Europeans and Ameli cans will be supplanted in their trade relations in the far east. The flna-* ciers who are building such commerce now of course will not believe such a statement, but they will realize the truth of it in years to come. Adolph Busch, the St. Louis brew er, has evidently learned, what other brewers will have to learn sooner or later-the people will not allow obnoxious saloons to exist. Mr. Busch favors local option to vote them out. It will be the only salva tion of the liquor interests. The ob noxious saloons will have to go or the entire liquor traffic must cease. These two facts are apparent. ---o- If Heney is forced to grant Abe Ruef immunity to convict the San Francisco grafters the public will reach the conclusion that Abe was a whole lot wiser than people thought he was. It will be a case of convict ing the cats paw and letting the cat go free. -o Heinze flayed the Amalgamated, then the Amalgamated interests flayed him until now he has practi cally been eliminated from Montana mining operations, so they say, but it seems as if the courts can not get rid of the litigation he started. -0 Eastward the trend of saloon oppo sition in Montana wends its way. First there was early and Sunday closing in Missoula. Then Anaconda got into line. Next was Butte and then Hel ena, and 'now Livingston has the fever. Will Billings be next? -0--o--- The Anaconda Standard says it is too bad to be bald. The Butte Miner, whose editor lacks the required amount of locks, declares it is better to be bald than hair brained. And the unkind reader will probably remark that it is too bad to be both. F. Augustus Heinze has sold his in terest in the Butte Savings bank in Butte and announced that he has re tired from the banking business. There are people in Butte who wish he had retired from the banking business be fore he started. -o-- If Montana can secure her share of that river and harbor appropriation and the western states can get a just proportion of the legislation, the rivers and harbors bill will probably not be talked to death in the coming session of congress. ---o-- Harry Orchard seems to be keeping up his record as the arch fiend of the age. When a man can sit before a jury and recount tales of crimes as he does, it is no wonder that little confidence is placed in his statements. -----o--- For one who censures the president for his "butting in," as it terms it, it comes with bad grace for the Butte Miner to attempt to "butt in" on re publican politics. Yet it is a mighty cold day when the Miner don't try it. I --o-- I One trouble with Senator Tillman is that he always belongs to the "Wants to know class." And it is the men in that class who hinder the work of public officials who do things. -o-- First in sheep, first in oats, first in' wheat, first in alfalfa, first in sugar beets, first in potatoes-the Yellow stone valley is undoubtedly the finest agricultural district in the country. ---- The amount of space taken up by the newspapers to tell of the "suc cessful dishonest" would lead to the conclusion that they were in the ma jority in the successful column. -0-------. Boston has gone republican. That must lessen William A. Douglas' chances for securing the second place on the presidential ticket to be named by the democrats. This is December 13. Christmas is only twelve days .away, and yet we have heard nothing about a coal short age. All our worry last summer was apparently with out cause. - -o-~-- . It is to be hoped that none of the Colorado political methods will be per mitted to corrupt the national demo cratic convention when it meets. in Denver. -----o-- At the present rate the American public will soon have committed to memory the evidence in the Pettibone and Powers trials. They have read it often enough. Carnegie's $2,000,000 gift to his in stitute would indicate that even a financial stringency cannot stop his money supply. -0-- General Funston will probably have a harder job pacifying the mine own ers and miners of Goldfield than he had pacifying the Filipinos. - -o Every time the win4 blows right hard or the mercury takes a drop, one realizes the importance of Carbon county and her coal fields. Let us not forget that even the financial stringency will not affect the young child's belief in Santa Claus and act accordingly. -0-- If the currency bills introduced in congress could be used for currency, the money stringency might be re lieved. -----o--- If Senator Tillman don't watch out, Jeff Davis will usurp his place as fire eater of the senate. ---0~-- It is only the. uccessful man that the knockers attack.

GREAT FLEET IS ALL READY PREPARATIONS FOR TRIP TO PA CIFIC COMPLETED. SUPPLIES ON BOARD Every Preparation Completed the Same as Though the Fleet Were Preparing for a War Cruise-Could Take Trip Around the Globe. Old Point Comfort, Va., Dec. 12. Final word of "ready" was flashed from every vessel in the battleship fleet today. This signal meant that the 16 most powerful armorclads of the American navy were ready not only to start next Monday morning on their projected cruise to the western seas, but are just as ready to go any where in the two hemispheres of the world and do any work. It means that the hulls are sweet and clean; that the giant compound engines are restless to be at their tasks; that officers hnd men are trained to the hour;. that bunkers are overflowing with the best steam coal that the mines can produce; that the larders are choked with provisions, and that magazine doors are closed upon the greatest stores of ammuni tion ever placed on board American vessels of war. The care with which the ships have been groomed for their forthcoming voyage and the completeness with which they have been stored with all the necessities of a battleship's use fulness in peace or war, leave no doubt of the mobility and self-reliance of the great armed force. Even the officers themselves are just a little bit surprised at the amount of work that has been accomplished and the quiet confidence that has marked every step of preparation. If the ships were destined for im mediate conflict little more could be done to make them ready for the fray. The distinctive white and buff paint, which has brought so much ad miration to the American ships when pitted on parade against the grimy hulled navies of other nations, would, of course, have to give way in favor of the safer tone of leaden gray, but that is a matter of only a. few hours' work. Maps of the Course. There is an entire absence of en thusiasm, but a manifest atmosphere of serious devotion to duty surround ing the departure of the fleet. The or ders and the published itinerary has manifested much interest and amuse ment on the route. One of the points of complete read iness marking the present status of the fleet is to be found in the chart houses of the navigating officers. When the fleet was first expected to prepare for a Pacific voyage the nav igators of each ship were supplied with special prepared charts leading down the south Atlantic coast, leading through the treacherous waters of Magellan straits and along the Pacific coast to San Francisco. Several weeks ago these charts were supple mented by others showing the way to Manila. Then more recently have come lately revised charts capable of guid ing the fleet all the way to Gibraltar. The furnishing of these charts has given rise to gossip that the fleet is destined eventually to circle the globe and that there may be something more beyond Magdalene bay than San San Francisco. The Mayflower will arrive goon af ter 8 a. m. and after being saluted with 21. guns, will anchor near the center of the filet. Flag and com manding officers will repair on board and be received by the president. The fleet will sail about 10 a. m., being pre ceded to the Horseshoe in Chesapeake bay by the Mayflower, which will anchor. The fleet then will pass in review at 10 knots an hour and in sin gle column. Saluting again as they pass, the ships will proceed to sea. A searchlight drill tonight by all the vessels was a brilliant spectacle. 

HEADQUARTERS OF CANDIDATES MANAGERS OF ASPIRANTS SE CURE ROOMS IN CHICAGO. HANNA'S ROOM TO TAFT Representatives of Taft, Fairbanks and Hughes Making Preparations for Quarters in Auditorium Annex in Chicago-Cummins May Run. Chicago, Dec. 12.-Contracts were closed at the Auditorium hotel today for the quarters which the managers of Secretary Taft's candidacy cam paign are to 'occupy during the repub lican convention in June, 1908. Rooms were also secured for the Ohio, New York and Indiana delegations and for the managers of Vice President Fair banks' interests. C. S. Watts of Columbus, Ohio, act. ed for Arthur Voris, Secretary Taft's campaign manager, and selected the suit in the Auditorium Annex from which Mark Hanna directed two cam paigns for William McKinley. The Young Men's Blaine club of Cincin nati, the Tippacanoe club of Cleveland, and the Young Men's Republican club of Columbus, will occupy adjoining apartments. J. P. Goodrich of Indianapolis signed the contracts for the Indian quarters, from which the vice president's cam paign will be directed. The Indiana delegates and several political organ izations of the state will be on the same ~loor. The New York delegates will occupy the same rooms which they had in 1904, the south parlor of the Audi torium proper. Arrangements to this effect were completed by Lafayette Gleason of New York, who has been here for a week. Reports that he was acting for Governor Hughes were de nied tonight by Mr. Gleason. Want Cummins to Run. Des Moines, Ia., Dec. 12.-Governor Cummins was urged today to announce himself a candidate for the republican party presidential nomination, and it is likely that he will do so following a conference of prominent Iowa re publicans to be called soon to canvass the situation.

LONGWORTH HAS APPENDICITIS OPERATION PERFORMED AT THE WHITE HOUSE. Washington, Dec. 12.-Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, daughter of President Roosevelt, was operated on for appen dicitis at the white house this mo-n ing. The operation was successful, the patient rallying quickly. At the conclusion of the operation, which was successful in every res:,ect according to the physicians, Mrs. Longworth emerged from the influence of the anesthetic in a very short time, and after exchanging a few words with Mrs. Cowles, her aunt, and with her husband, she fell asleep naturally and enjoyed a nap lasting two hours. Her condition was such that Presi dent Roosevelt felt little apprehension, and, in fact, did not hesitate to en gage in his afternoon tennis game with Ambassador Jusserand, Gifford Pinchot and Assistant Attorpey Gen eral Cooley. About a week ago preparations were begun for the operation, which was de cided on after she had suffered for a month.
