THE LEDGER. THURSDAY, DECEMBER S. The wooden stile blocks nmst go. Those who want Mexico real estate should buy this fall. The wooden awnings on the west side of the square will go next. Patkoxize home institutions and buy your goods from local mer chants. W. J. Stone, Governor-elect of Missouii, is in New York to attend the tariff reform banquet given to President-elect Cleveland. Some of the business men of Mex ico who claim that advertising in local papers does not pay, never let an opportunity pass to patronize traveling snaps and fakirs. The removal of the wooden awn ings on the north side of the square is now in order. Dobyns A Ciibbs are very anxious to have theirs taken down. J. 1$. Clauk, of Rush Hill, Mo., is prominently mentioned as the next postmaster of that place under the Democratic administration. We understand there will be several other applications. Col. Richard Dalto.v, of Ralls county, has been mentioned for nearly ever' office, appointive or elective, in Missouri excepting that of postmaster of Saverton, Ralls eounty, Missouri. It strikes us that Congress should meet on the 4 th of March following the November election regularly, in stead of the 2nd of December fol lowing. We see no reason why the date should not be changed. The Republicans in and around Rush Hill, we are informed, expect to hold the position of postmaster four years longer by having the present incumbent resign and a new man appointed. Rush Hill will have a Democratic postmaster long before the boys celebrate the 4th of July. The Chinese registration law, which requires Mongolian laborers to furnish photographs of themselves for purposes of indentification, is re ported to be a failure. It could not have been otherwise, so far as the provision relating to the photographs was concerned. All Chinamen look alike. One of Mexico's largest adver tisers is arranging to place in the Ledger a test advertisement. Some time between now and the middle of January he will insert an advertisement in this paper offerine; an inducement to those who read it "txr -nrrimi-r. Wc ro nire -that fa will le better satisfied than ever that advertising pays. Hon. J. T.Bradshaw,editor of the Lebanon (Mo.) Rustic, is promi nently mentioned by his friends for Postmaster at Lebanon, the home of "Silver Dick" Bland. Mr. Brad shaw is one of Missouri's most ac tive and energetic Democratic edi tors aud if he will accept the post office he should have it without any opposition. Col. Johx E. Hlttox delivered his lecture at Auxvasse to a small but appreciative audience. There would have been a great many more present to hear him if the lec ture had been properly advertised and a mistake had not been made in the time and place. Those who listened to the Colonel pronounce his lecture very fine. Col. Hutton wc- understand, will connect him self with some large Eastern lecture bureau and deliver his lecture in the larger cities throughout the United States this winter. There are still a very few people who do not think advertisements are reaa. some oi these same people think newspapers are as a rule, not generally read by the pub lie. The Callaway Gazette stands ready to test this matter. It offers to publish free of cost a proposition from any merchant to "give one dollars' worth of sugar for each cat delivered at his place of business within ten days." The Gazette is willing ' to place the advertisement in the most obscure corner of the paper. The Ledger will localize and thereby double the number of pounds of sugar offered. Quite a number of newspapers throughout the country are hopping on to the bones of Jay Gould like human vultures. These papers find it popular with certain classes and not at all dangerous to abuse a man after he is dead. Referring to this matter the Kansas City Star says: Now that Mr. Gould is dead any number of persons are announc ing that he was all sorts of mean things and claiming that his success was due to his cold-blooded enn nmg. It has come out in the biographies that Gould was a very hard working man ; that, as a bov, he was used to getting up at 4 o'clock in the morning to study, while the other youth of the generation that is abusing him were getting their "beauty sleep." It haa also been found that he was regular and meth odical in his work, and it is likely tnat there was not so much luck and cold-bloodedness in hia success as the unthinking were likely to sur mise. Mr. Gould was not a proper character to walk up and down the pages of a Sunday School book, be cause his ambition was not of a high order, but such as it was he stuck to it and kept it before him early and late, and finally satisfied it. That is something to one's credit ven if the ambition is not the best. Is this issue of the Ledokk will be found President Harrison's last annual message to Congress. The peculiar interest attaching to this document is, that it is the last mes sage from a Republican president that any one now living will ever have an opportunity to read. Those who contemplate buying Christmas presents should examine the stocks of goods on exhibition in this city before sending away. The merchants of Mexico are carrying larger and better lines of goods than ever before. There is no necessity for sending to St. Louis to purchase your Christmas presents. X A 

RTIS SB t BUI FfcM S. Correspondent of the L axlgt-r. Martixseiru, Mo., Dec. 7, Sunday is a very popular day at Martinsburg for Wellsville folks, Mrs. Crigler, of Mexico, vit-ited among her many friends here last week. The meeting at the Christian church closed at the end of two weeks with twenty additions. Everybody has got a bad cold. There is lots of sickness in this end of the county. Among the births during the lastj week or so are: To Mr. and Mrs. Wm. Pike, a daughter; to Mr. and Mrs. Benny Kimnoe, a son ; to Mr. and Mrs. Nelson, a son ; to M.r and Mrs. Ruschenburg, a son. Our county papers have been booming our town considerable of late, but not more than is due it. Coal is being shipped out in large quantities every day besides sup plying the local demand which is great. More hands are wanted at the pit and there is no excuse for idle bones around here and no room for them either. What we need and are going to continue to need Lots of hands at the pit. Moneyed men who are not afraid to build a lot of houses for rent, thereby realizing more than 10 per cent, upon principal invested. We are sure that a miniature race track here for some of our amateur race horses should be built. We are sure that a bank at this place would do well. Why shouldn't it? We need a delivery arrangement here and the first firm starting one out is going to get all the town trade "and don't you forget it." And we need another shaft at the west end of town to balance with the east end, and guess we'll have it, too,as we hear that a company is or ganized for that purpose. Messrs. Glass, Cale and Cash Copeland and Messrs. Travis, Rob ert, Shaner and Harris formed a hunting crowd who spent a part of last week near Shamrock and re turned loaded dowri"'wTagarne Of various kinds. Mr. and Mrs. Williams are absent on a visit through the east. A Union Sunday School has been organized by Prof. Settles which is proving quite a success. We are sure to have a Christmas tree laden with the fruit of the purse as a good committee is already in charge of it. BESTOS CITY ITEMS. Correspondence of the Ledger. Bextox City, Mo., Dec. 6. We had the ' pleasure of attending a crystal wedding at the residence of Mr. and Mrs. J. W. McCormick, where a large crowd of friends and relatives had gathered to celebrate their fifteenth anniversary. It was the most enjoyable affair we have attended for some timer At 10 o'clock an excellent supper was set which the crowd all did justice to. A large table was entirely covered witn presents among which we noticed a set of solid silver knives, forks and spoons, given by Reuben Harris, of Nevada, Mo. Mr. Mc Cormick treated all those that en joyed smoking to choice Havana cigars. At midnight the crowd left wishing Mr. and Mrs. McCormick many happy anniversaries. Dr. J. J. Ilalley will return Thurs day from St. Louis where he has been attending his brother Sam who is some better. Jas.

The averaed an nual value of our imports and exports of iner cbardise for the ten fl-tcal years prior to 1SU was $1.4o7.i..01u. It will be observed that our foreign trade for 1SU2 exceeded this annual av erage value by $4U0.a58.3ul, au increase of 7.47 per t?ent. The signlncance and valne of this in crease are shown by the fact that the excess iu the Trade of 1H9? over 1?1 was wholly in the value of exports, for there was a decrease in the value of exports or $17,813,761 The value of our export during the fiscal year ltW reached the highest figure in the history of the government, amounting to Sl,f)Ji7f!,14 exce ding by 145.77 338 the ex- Kirts of 11. and exceeding the value of the iports by Ji)li.l75,6(ta. A comparison of the value of our exports (or 192 with the annnal average for the ten years prior to 1891 shows an exc 'S3 of $2tV.14?.6Tl. or of H4.65 per cent. The value of onr imports of merchandise for 1p92, which was $K3),40.'.462 also exceeded the annual average value of th ten years prior to 18SH bv Sl;!5.215.940- During the fljeal year li?3. the valne of imports free of duty amounted to 4o7,yp9,8'H. the largest aggregate in the history of our commerce. Tue value of the imports of merchandise en tered free of duty in IMT-i was 55.35 per cent, of the total value of the import, as compared witb 43.35 per " "ut ia ls"i and 33.60 per cent, in 185HI. OOASTWISB TRADE AND INTKRXAL COMMERCE. In our coastwise trade a most encouraging development ia in progress, there having beeu in th last four years an increase of 18 per cent. In internal commerce the etatietica show that no s'icb period of prosperity has ever before existed. T:;e freight carried in the coastwise trade of the great lakes in 18i0 aggregated 28, 2Si5.9.'0 tons. Ou the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers and tributaries, in the same year the traffic ag gregated 29.404, 4te3 tons, and the total vessel tonnage passing tbrongh the Detroit river dur ing tnat year was 21.u3l.9UU ton. The vessel tonnage entered aud cleared in the foreign trade of London during lt90 amounted to 13. 4 0,7ti7 tons, and of Liverpool 10.941.200 tons, a total for these two great shipping points of 24, 422. 7 tons, oniy slightly in excess of the vessel tonnage passing through the Detroit rivsr. And iHrllouM be said that the season for the Detroit VTr?T -C fwi-aw-i.j.i- n Aol.i m - n w London and Liverpool the season waa for the entire year. The veesel tonnage passing through tbf St. Marv'a canal for the fiscal year 192 amounted to 9.28,874 tons, and the freight tonnage of the Detroit river is estimated for that year at 25.0UU.0W tons, against 23.3in.610 tons in 1891. Tne aggregate traffic on onr rail roa lf for the year 181 amounted to 704.P95.8uR. tons of freight, compared with 601.344,437 tons In 10. an increase of 13,054,172 tons. ANOTHER INDICATION OF PROSPBRITT. Another indication of the general prosperity of tfee country is found in the fact that the nnmlter of d-potoia in aavinrs hanks in creased from H93.870 in 18J to 4.25S.S93 in 1890, an iniiraase of bli per cent., and the amount of deponits from ,14'i.277.504 in 18i0 to $1,524,844. 604 in 1890. an increase of 921 per cent. Au 1891 the nnionnt of deposits in savings uanks was $1,8J,079,749. It is antimated that 90 per cent. of these deims its represent the savings of wage earners. The bank of clearances for nine months ending Heptember 30, iK91, amounted to $41,049,390,51)8. For the same mouths in 1892 they amounted to $i5.18,r!ol.947, an eicesa for tLe nine months of $4,139,211,139- WORK AND WAGRS. There never has been a time in onr history when work was so abundant or when wages Were as high, whether injasureii by the cur rency iu which they are paid or by their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It is true that the market prices of cotton ani wheat have been low. It is one of the unfavorable incideiita of agriculture that the ' farmer can not prodnce upon orders. He must sow and reap iu ignorance of the aggregate production of the year, and is peculiarly sub ject to the depreciation which fol owa over production. But while the fact I have stated is true as to the crops I have mentioned, the geneial average of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in th? gf.n?ral prosperity. The value of our total farm products has iucreased from 1.363. 646.86$,ii00 in I860 to$4,5UO,onOin 1891.aseitimated by !-t.'iiitici.in, an increase o' 10 per cent, T,;e linmberof hoga January 1, 191. was ou.tiio, ln. aid their valu $210,193.92 ; on January 1, 1892. the number waa f2,398,019. aud the value $241 91,415. On Jauuary 1. 131. the numb t of cattle wa 36.i 75.648, and the valuo $544,127,908; on January 1. 1892. the nnmber was 37.651.239, and the valua $ .70,749,155. If any are dlacouteuted with their state here, if any believe that tha wages or prices, the re turus for hooest toil are inadequate, the; siiotil.1 not fail to remerutier that thjre is no other country in the world wh--re the condi tion that seem to them hard would not lie ac cente as hiiih'v prosperous. The English agnciilturist would be glad to exchange the re turn of his labor for those of the American farmer, and the Manchester workmen then wagi for those of their ellowa at Fall River THK PROTKCTIVB SYSTEM. I believe that the protective ay&t9m. which now lor aouietuing nxe cmrty years nas pre. vniimi in our l.-fftelatioa. has been a mightv in strum-.-nt fur the development of our natioual wwaltb. aad a most powerful agency in protect iua- the hoflaes of ur workinguten from the in- vasiouof want.

Tho proposition to elect United States Senators by popular vote has been carried in California by a large majority. The movement to this end, originating in Illinois, is meet ing with much favor in all sections, and it seems probable that at no re mote period the Upper House of Congress will spring as directly from the people as now does the body which forms its complement in leg islation. The popularization of our house of lords will be a long stride in the pathway of Democratic pro gress. Cold Ware Comlnir Get ready for it.

The strained aud too often disturbed rela tions oxietitig betwaeu the employe aud the em ployer iu our great manufacturing eutablleli innuta have nut beeu favorable to calm con sideration by tha wage-earnera of the eff ort upon wages of the protective avaiem. The fact that bis wanes were tha hlgbeat paid la like callings in the world, and that a main tenance of this rate ef wage in the absence of protectee duties upon tha product of hia lHtor was impossible, were obacured by the paaaion evoked by these contests, lie may now tw able to review i he question in the I ght of hia personal xperlnnoa uader the operation of a tariff for rev-nue only. If that expeviauce aball demonstrate that present rates of waxes are thereby uiaintaiued or increased, either absolutely or in their purobaaiug power and that the aggregate volume of work to be done in this com. try is increased, or avan main tained so that there are more or so. many day' work In a year at aa good, or better, wages tor the American workman a baa been the caae under tha protective ays tain, everyone will rejoice.

POHSIQN UEIJiTONS. Our relations with othsr milious are now un disturlHtd tiy any serious controversy. Tha complicated and threatening differences with ilermany and England r;l iting to Samoan affairs, with Ruglaud it) relation to the seal nshoc?os in the Beliring sea. and with Chili growing out of th- Baltimore affair, baiebeen adjusted. REtlPBOCITT AQRKItMKNTS, There bavo been negotiates! aud concluded, uuder section A of the taritf law, commercial agreements relating to reciprocal trade with the following countries: Hra7.il, Dominican, Republic. 8paiu for Cuba an 1 i'ortn Rico. Uua tfnmla. Ssivadoc. the C rimn empiro. Great Britaui for certain West ludia colonies and British Guiana, Nicaragua, Honduras aud Austria-Hungary. Of these, tliese with Gua temala, S.ilva.lor. th Goririau empire. Great Britain. Nicaragua, Honduras and Austria Hungary have heu concludeil sines my lastau uual mess iRe. Under these tm-te arrangements, a f l a f a v red admission his been seeur.'d in every case for au inumrtan. list of American products. Eipecial care has lasen taken to se cure msrk-ts for farm products in order to re lieve that great uuderlyin iniustry of ths de pression which the lack of an adequate foreign market for our surplus oft u brings. An open ing has also been made fo manufactured prod uces that will un ioubte ily, if this policy is maintained, greatly augme it our export trade. Tue full beuenisof these arrangements can not 1m realized blatantly. N w lines of trade are to be opened. The commercial traveler must survey the nsid. The ;na mfacturer must adapt bis goods to the new mrrkets an 1 faci.i tiee for exchange must b- established. This work has been well begun; onr merchants and manuf act urers bave entered the new fields with courage and enterprise. In the case of food products and siiecial lilies of trade with Cuba, tha trade did not n-ed to wait and the imme diate results have been most gratifying. If this policy and the trade arrangements can be contluued in force and aided by tbe establishment of American ateamshlo linfs, I do not donbt that we shall w.thin a short period, secure fully one-third of tbe total trade of tbe countries of Central and South America, which now amounts to about tfj(W.iW0,i) annually. In 1B05 we had only 8 per cent, of this trade. TUB BBUftlNQ SKA QIIBSTIO-f. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the dispute between Great Britain and the United States as to the killing of fcesls in the Behring aea was concluded on the 3Jth of Febrnary last. This treaty was accompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arbitration, and a vigoroua effort waa made during this season to drive out all poaching steamers from the Behriug sea. Six naval ves sels three revenue cutters, ani one vessel from the fish -OTnrtwms, ui mm1 - 41. 4uimroand jjt Commander Evans, of the navy. were sent into the aa, which was systematically patroled. riome seizures were made, and it ia believed that tbe catch iu the Behrinr sea by poachers amounted to less than 500 sQals- It is true, however, that in the Xorih Pacific, while the seal herds were on their way to t he passes be tween the Alutian islands, a very large uum ber, and probably 30,(100. were taken. Tbe ex isting statutes of the United States do not restrain our citizens from talcing seals in the Pacific ocean, and perhaps should not, un less the prohibition can bj extended to the citizens of other nations. 1 reco nmend that power be given to the president, by proclama tion, prohibit the taking of seals in the North Pacific by An.arii.-an vesse's ia se either, as to the result of findings of the tribunal of arbi tration or otherwise, tbe restraints can be ap plied to the vessels of all countries. The case of the United Stntes for the tribunal of arbi tration lias b en prepared wiih gr at care and industiy by Hon. John W. Foster, and the counsel who represent this government exnresa confidence that a result substantially establish ing our claims and preserving this great indus try to the benefit of all nations will be at tained. BBClPROCrTV 

WITH C AS ADA. During the past year a suggestion waa re ceived turougo tbe British Minister that the Canadian government would like to confer as to tbe possibility of enlarging, upon terms of mutual a Ivautag . the commercial exchanges of Canada a-id or the United Sl ates, and a con feraiice was held at Washington, with Mr. Blaine acting for this gove-nment, and the Britis-i minister at this capital and tbr -e mem bers of the Dominion cabinet acting as com missioners on tha part of Great Britain. Tho conference developed the fact that the Canadian government was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for the concessione a-;ked the admission of natural products. The statement was frankly luade that favored rates could not be given to tbe United Stalea as against the mother country. This admission, which was foreseen, necessarily terminated the conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange of the natural products would be almost wholly with the peo ple of Canada. Ober tcpics of interest were considered in the couferene) and have resulted in the making of a convention for examining the Alas'tan boundary, tbe waters of Passama quoddy bay a-l jaoeat to E.istpjrt, Me., and on the initiation of an arrangement for tbe pro tection of fish life in the coterminous and neighboring waters of our nor boundary. THE CAXAX. TOLLS COXTHOVBRST. The controversy as to the tolls npon tba Weliand canal which was presented to congress at the last session by special message, having faile 1 of adjustment, 1 felt constrained to ex ercise the authority conferred by the act of July 26, 192, a-id to proclaim a susiiensien of the free use of St. Mary-s Falls- canal to oar getin iu transit to ports in Canada. The secre tary of the treasury established suck toils as were thought to bo equiv alent to the exactions uajustly levied np ou ourco-nmerce in the Canadian oaaala. If. as we must suppose, the political relation of Canada ani tje disposition of the Canadian government are to remain unchanged, a some what ra'Iicat revision of our trade relations should, I thiuk. b) made. Our relations must continue to be intimste, aud tbey should ba tnendly.

His unrufiled coolness under all circumstances, keen . perception, prompt decision and action, as well as remarkable memory, were the strong, natural factors that made his career successful.

TUBCKNTBAL AND SOOTH AUIIK1CA BBFUBUOS. I have endeavored in eery way to aasure our aiater republics of Csntritl aud noulh America that tbe United States government and its peo ple bave ouly the roost friendly disposition to ward them all. We do tmt covet their terri tory. We bave no diap-iaftiom tu be oppressive or eiai'tlng in our dealings with any of them, even the weakest. Our interests and our hopes for them all lie in tue direction of atable ovsrntnenta by their people and of the argest development of their great com mercial retouroee. The mutual benefits of eularged commercial rxebaugea and of a more familiar and frien Uy intercourse betweeu our people we do desire, aud la thia bave sought their friendly co operation. I have believed, however, while holding these sentiments in tbe greatest sincerity, that wa must insist npon a just reapniisihillty for any injuriea inflicted upon onr official representa tives or niton onr citizens. This insistence, kindly and justlv, bat firmly ma le. will, I be lieve, promote peace and mutual r -apeot. OUR RELATION WITH HAWAII. Our relations with Hawaii bava been such as to attract an increased interest and must con tinue to do so. I deem it of great importance that the projected submarine cabl, a survey for whxh has been made, Khonld be promoted. Both for naval and commercial uses, we should bava quick communication with Honolulu. We ahould before this have availed ourselves of the concession made many years ago to this government for a harbor and naval station at Pjarl river. Many evi dences of tbe friendliness of tbe Ha waiian government have bson given in the past, and it ia gratifying to believe that tbe advantage and necessitv of a continuauca of very cloae relations la appreciated. THB NBW O BLEAKS LVNCHINO. Tba friendly act of this government in ex pressing to tbe government of Italy ita repro bation and abhorrence of tbe lynching of Ital ian aubjscts in Saw Orleans by the payment of lV&.OOU franca, or $24.SJ 9U, was accepted by tbe king of Itaiv with every manifestation of gra cious appreciation, and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and gool will. A PROTEST TO PBANCS. In consequence of tbe action of tbe French government in proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal diatnots ot the west coast of Africa, eastward of the Sau Pedro rivr. I have felt constrained to make protest against thia encroachment npon the territory of a republic wb ch was founded by citizens of the United States, and towards which this country baa for many yeara held the intimate relation of a friendly counslr. OOOD WILL TO MEXICO. The recant disturbancea of tbe pub lic peace by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican frontier bava afforded tha govarnm-nt an opportunity to testify its good will for Mexico and its earoeat purpose to ful fill the obligations of international friendship by pursuing and dispersing tbe evil doers. Tbs work of re-locating tha boundary of the treaty of-Gaudaloupe Hidalgo westward from El Paso ia progressing favorably. PBIHIfBLT WITH BPAIX. Our intercourse with Spain continues on a friendly footing. I regret however, not to be sole to report as yet the adjustment of the claims of tbe American missionaries arising from the disorders at Ponupe in the Caroline ialands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjust ment in view of renewed and urgent represen tatives to tbs government at Madrid. CONTROVERSY WITH TUBBBT. The treatment of tba religions and educa tional establishments of American citisens in Turkey has ot late called for mors than the usual share of attention. A tendency to T-?- toleration which has beneficially prevailed la discernible, and has called forth the earnest remonstrances of this government. Harraasing regulations in regard to schools and churches have been attempted ia certain localities, but not with out due protest and tbs assertion of tbe in herent and conventional righta of oar country men. Violations ot domlcle and search of the persons and effects of citizens of the United States by apparently irresponsible offlcia s in tbs Asia;1c vilaysts bavs from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of injury to tbe property of an American missionary at Bourdeur. in the province of Konia, called forth an argent claim for repa ration, which I am pleased to say was prompt ly heeded by tbs government of the Porta. In terference with the trading ventures of our citi zens in Asia Miner is also reported, and tbe lack of consular representation in that region is a serious drawback to instant and effective Srotection. I can not believe that these ind ents represent a settled policy and shall not cease to urge the adoption of proper remedies. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. International copyright has bean extended to Italy by proclamation in conformity with the act of March 3, 1891. npon assurance being given that Italian law permits to citizens of tne United States tbe benefit of copyright on substantially tho same basts as tbs subjects ot Italy. By a special convention, proclamation Jan uary 15, 1892, reciprocal provisions of copyright hsva been applied between the United States and Germany. Negotiations are in progress with otber oountries to ths same and. THE NICARAGUA CANAL. I repeat with groat earnestness tha recom mendation wjich I bays made mention of in a previous messiges to the inadequate support given the American company engaged in the conatructton of the Nicaragua ship canal. It is impossible to overstate the value from every standpoint of this great enterprise, and I hope that there may bs tims given in this congress to give to it an impetua that will inturj the early completion of the canal and aecure to tbe United States its proper relations to it when completed. TBI MONETARY CONFERENCE. The congress has been already advised that tbe invitations ot this government for ths as sembling of an international monetary confer ence to consider the question of an enlarged issue of silver accepted by tbe nations to which they were issued. The conference assembled at Brussels on ths 22d of November, and has entered npon tbe consideration of this great question. I bava not doubted, and nave taken occasion to express tbat belief, as well in the invitations issued for this conference as in my public messages, that tha f res coinage of silver upon an agreed international ratio would greatly promote the interests of our people and equally those of other nations. It la too early to prediot what results may b acoompliehed oy tbe conference. If any temporary check or delav Intervenes, I believe that very aeon commercial eenditleaa will compel ths now reluctant governments to unite with as in this movement to secure the enlsrsrement of the volame of mantr needed tor the transaction of the bnslness of tbe world.

TUB DKAIK OF OOLD. Tba public confidence in tbs purpose and ability of tha government to maintain tho parity of all our money lasues, whether twin or paper, moat remain unshaken. The demand for gold in Europe, and tba consequent calls upon us. are in a considerable degree tbe reault of tbe efforts of soma of the European govern ments to Increase their gold reserves, aud tfaeas efforts should be met by appropriations npon our part. Tbe conditions tbat hava created tbis drain of tha treasury gold are in an important degree polit ical and not commercial. Iu view of tbe fact tbat a general revision of our revenue isws in tbe near futnre seems to be probable, it would be better that any changes ahould b a part of tbat revision rather than ot a temporary na ture. Unriug the last fiscal year tie s cvtary pnr-cbas-d. under tbe act of July 14, IK9-J. 54 h 718 ounc"s of silver, and Issued m paym tnt thereof f51, 1116.508 iu notes.

Tbe report of tbe secretary of war brings again to the attention of congress aome im portant auggestious aa to the re-organization of tbs infantry and artillery arms ot the serv ice, which his predecessors bave before urged that tbay be pressed. Our army is small, but its organisation should all tbe more be put upon tba most approved modern basis. The condi tions upou what we have ceded the "frontier" heretofore required 'the main tenance of many small pos:s, but now tbe policy of concentration is obviously the right one. Ths new posts should bave ths proper strategic relations to tbaoulr "frontiers-1 we bow nave, toose of tbe sea ooaBt and of tha northern and part ot our southern boun dary. I do not think tbat auy question of ad vantage in localities or t ttea shoul i determine the location of tha new posts. Tbs organi sation and enlargement of ths bureau of military information which the secretary has eUectad is a work the usefulness of which will become svsry ysar more apparent. Tbs work of building heavy guns an 1 the construction of coast defenses has been well begun aud ahould be carried on without ch -ok. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The report of the attorney-general is by law aubmitted directly to congress, but I can not refrain from saying tbat he has conducted tbe increasing work of tbs departm jnt of justice witb great professional skill. He basin several directions secured from ths courts decisions giving increased protection to the officers of tbe Un ted States and bringing soma classes of crims that escaped local cognizance and pnniahmsnt into tbe tribnnals of the United states, where they could bs tried with impartiality. I have heretofore expressed my concurrence in the recommendation of the attorney general that degreea of murder should b.i roc jgnixed in the federal statutea as they are, I believe, in all tbe states. These Igrades are founded on cor rect distinctions la crime. The recognition of them would enable tbe courts to ex ircse some discretion in apportioning punisbmont aud would greatly reliavs the executive of what is coming to be a 'very heavy burden the exam ination of these cases on application for com mutation. THE COURT OF CLAIMS. The aggregate of claims pending against tha government in the court of claimsis enormous. Claima to tbe amount of nearly $400,000,000 for taking of property. f..r injury of persons c.aim- lug ro OS loytfl uuilug ebe ww are now beloce that oourt for examination. Wbeu to those are added tbe Indian depredations claims and the French spoliation claims, an aggregate la reached tbat ia indeed atartling. In the defense ot these claims tbe gov ernment is at a great disadvantage. Tbe claimants have preserved their evidence, whereas the government has to send agents to rumage the field for what they can not find. Tbis difficulty is peculiarly great where tbe fact to be established is the dis loyalty of tbe claimant during the war. If this great threat against our revenues is to have no other check, certainly congress should aupply the department of justice with appropriations sufficiently liberal to secure the best legal talent in the defense of these claims and to pursue its vague search for evidence. THB POST OFFICE DBPABTMBNT. The report of the postmaster-general sbows a most gratifying increase and a moat efficient and progressiva management of ths great busi ness of tbat department. The remarkable in crease in revenues. in the number ot post-offices and in tbe miles of mail interchange furnishes further svidenoes of tbe high state ot pros perity which our people are enjoying New offices mean new hamleta and towns; new routes mean ths extension of our border set tlements and increase 1 revenues mean activa commerce. The postmaster-general reviews the whole period of his administration of the office aud brings soma of bis statistics down to the month of Novsm bsr last. The postal revenues have increased during ths laat year nearly S5.000.0i0. Ths deficit for the year ending June 30. 1892, is 848,341 less than that deficiency of tbs preced ing year. The deficiency of tl.e present fiscal year, it is sstimatsd, will be reduced to (1,552. 488. which will not only bs extinguished during the next fiscal year, but a surplus ot nearly (1,000.000 soonld then be shown. In the calculations t i payments to bo made nnder ths contracts for 'K:ean mail serv.ee have not been included. There have been added 1,060 new mail routes Outing ths year witb a mileage of 8,863 miles, and the total number of new miles of mail trips added during tbe year is nearly 17.000.000. The number of milea of mail journeys added during the last four vears is about "6,00 1,000. tbis addition being 21.000,000 of miles mors than were in operation in the whole country in 1801. The number of pest offics has been tn creaaed by 2,790 during the ysar, and during the past four years, up to October 2t last, ths total increase in the numbsr of offices has been nearly 9.000. The numbir of ire t-dellviry offices haa been nearly doubled in the past four years, aud tbe number of money-order offices more than doubled within thtt time. For three years ending Jane : 0, 18HS, tbe postage revenue amounted to $187,741,362, wbi b was an increase of $52,243,150 ever ths revenue for the three years euded Jnie 30, 1888, the increase during tue laat three years being more than three and a balf timea aa great as tbe increase during the three years ending June SO, 1881. No suck increase as tbat ahown for these thrss years has aver previously appeared in the revenues of the de partment. The postmaster-general has ex tended to the post offices iu the larger cities ths msi It system of promotion, introduced by my dirsction into the dspar.meuts uere, and it hi:a resulted there, as ia the departments, ia a large vela we of work and that better done.

From the legislature to jail is not an unheard-of thing in the history of state governments, but in going from jail to the legislature Judge Lane, presiding judge of the County Court of Cass county, Missouri, will have rather exceeded the record. Jud6e Lane is an official resident of one of those counties sweating under the burden of a great railroad debt. The duty of the judge was to have levied a tax to meet interest on these bonds, but, leaning in his sympathies toward the tax-payers, he refused. For this he was sen tenced to jail by a United States Judge. While in jail the populace, relieved of an impending financial stress by his action, nominated him for representative.

THE liTTBBIOB DBPABTH BUT. The work of tbe interior department, always very burdensome, haa been larger than ever befera during the administration of Secretary Noble. Tbe disability psnsion law. taking ef tbe eleventh census, the opening of vast areas of Indian lands to settlement, the organization of Oklahoma, and the negotiations for tbe ces sion of Indian lands furnish some of the nar- ticulara of the increased work: and the results achieved testify to the abilltv. fldelitv and In dostry of the bead of the department and hia emctent assistants. THB aOVEHNHIST OP ALASKA. Tha form of srovernBsent nrovided hv eon- gross on May 17, 1884, for Alaska, waa, to its frame and purpose, temporary. The increase of ooDulatiou and the development of some lm portent mining and commercial interests make it imperative that tbe law should be revised and better provision made for the arrest and punishment or criminals. THE GENERAL LAND OFFICE. The report of the secretary shows a very gratifying state of affairs aa to the condition of tbe general land office.
