Mr. ViniACK fl'em., Ind.) suggested that thle pro ject would entail Immense patronage on the Ad ministration, wnlch would bavo the appointment or at least eight thousand emploieea to lake charge or the telegraphic business, which lad made the pro position an apoalllug one to blm, and would control hla vole ngalnsl It. Mr. Dawis admitted that there were undoubtedly difficulties In the way, but thai fct rather ren ered It more appropriate that the aubject should be re. ferred lo n select committee.

The mlnotlty of the committee had etiteu In Us report last Congress the great ob jection lo the project nas that the Government tel egraph would be uied for political purposes tnrough in urmy of officeholders, The facilities for thus using ti.e wire would be temptation so strong, and would be so difficult to detect, that it might well be doubted whether tl.e Administration vtuuld refrain from such use of them. I billete thai tLe committee on Appropriations Is the proper com. tnltteo lu consider the subject ; for that Committee would be very rarelul In recommending anything that would take from the people not IM.tOO.lKO but nearly TU.(MJ,liO. He did not believe thst the Com mittee would ever sanction sucn a ic.icme or evtn consider It lor a moment. Mr. JlANDALL(Detn., Pa.), rrmtrked that It waa coito-nirr wLeu a select committee was to be ap pointed on anr given aubject to choose msjorltt of those who were favorable to the proposlllon, and thrtr li wlabed lo iror mis acngui or rixxttn rlahl l lie U resboid.

Dills restoring to them their confiscated estates and all tbetr rights aa citizens or France are preparing, and will be Introduced at an early day. It Is antld pated that these measures will give rise to lorn and exciting debate. Ihe extreme Left Wing will meet them with propositions lor a general amnesty, whlcb, setting tree the thoosands of Communists still held prlsonsrs In the hulks and elsewhere, will be considered only an equitable complement of the act of Justice proposed lo be done lo the House of Orleana.

O'Concr at this point desired to read an afft darlt In answer to the pliers served on them Mr. Heynoidi objected, ot the ground thst tbe motion was made on the paper on which the order of arrest was granted. He said t "Itwe move ad ditional papers, ther mar reply with additional pa pers, but not otherwise.

Tne ob. Jed of ball Is slmplr to preserve the defendsnl in ihe Jurisdiction of t.ie Court. One million dollara might be regarded as excessive ball In regard to the greatest criminal under the most tyrannical Oovcrn mcnts. The complaint reads like a newspaper aril cle. It la written loosely, and not with precision It ll well to be ipecluc In allegation, and true In fact, In iuc.1 a case aa tbla, Uraat tbat Hall, Tweed, and Company are as bad aa they sre claimed lo be, ana have raised money improoerly on bond; there Is no allegation that these defendants sre hot aula to pay, or tiat ther think of fleeing, I only debate the right or wrong of these defendants from the complaint, but 1 rtn ss) that tbe ball Is excessive; It operates as a great oppression, and I atk your Honor, on the eaine papers which were betore mu mmed to yon, to reduce the amount. The Treas urrr of the State of New York, who bis sometimes f lO.CXU WMJ under his control, Is ouly required lo give hall in (.V),UO.

The plot lual some one other tnan tho people or New York were the proper plalntltla, and tho like, was not le letantto the motion to reduce bill I Hold that our duly tiere is nuiplr on the atumpilon that urtion was brought, and lo argue wheluer the ball should be altered, Mr Hetnoldt replied, that the order of arreit as regards Tweed, the defendant, snuuid bo vacated, 'In at wis part of their motion ; or if IwceUwae held, that his ball should be much reduced ilr. O'couor inquired ol the Judge, if, on motion to reduce ball, he would hear it motion to vacate ar reit. Ju Ige Learned decided that he would, and theie upon Mr () Conor sal down Mr l'lldin Iheu addtf-cd the Judge In opposi tion tu li e motion. He screed with the counsel on the other side as to the object cf ball, He auppoaed Twinl could pay fO.IIW.iK)). The other side ad mitted ta much tu their argument, A aum of money large for ono man would not be excessive for an other. Hie amount to be recovered was Immense, ami I doubtless was easier for Tweed to give ball In $1.0X1000, than for llurr In 10 000, or Jed Davie lnlioo.000.

Whenever Oirver collected a warrant, he paid over OA pir cent, to Woodward, and 31 percent, to Tweed. There were sonis twsntr-slx settlements, and Tweed got Ihe same percentage every time, without more than a very elltht variation. This Is not "Information an belief."

Ai lo Hie matter of bonds, tne law of 1S1 requir ing the Supervisors to limit this power of t, union to certain aum on Ihe money they raised, t'ley left out provision for these bonds. There Is no war lo piy them. Tne Stale can't be made lot nt anilnlng as a debt, An obligation resting on the State la worth nothing save br the Justice of the Legisla ture. A State Is bound morally lo pay the bonds under Its sanction, and there It baa an action agaln't those who disposed of tho bonds In question. It la contended that this action ihoulJ have been brought bv ihe county of New York rather lain bv the State.
