The Htrald'a special, dated' Fairfax, Dec. Is" pays: The expedition under General Stahl was undoubtedly one of the must brilliant and successful affaire of the war, both in its con ception and execution. Its principal object was to ascertain the whereabouts of Stone wall Jackson, and what forces were ou the right. This, and more, was accomplished. Jackson, with both the Hills, passed through Newmarket last Wednesday, on his way South. It is presumed he has gone to inter rupt Gen. Cox’s advance. Prisoners captured by Stahl report Waite, tne leader of White’s cavalry, twice wounded in a skirmish at Berryville, The New York Tima? Falmouth special dis patch states that two deserters from the reb els report their force at 73,000 to 70AK)9 —it does certainly not exceed the latter. Though Buffering from want of clothing and many kinds of supplies, still they are apparently hopeful of final success. Lee and his associates are puzzled over the movements of our army, which they do xot seem folly to comprehend, and have Dually concluded that the advance upon Fred ericksburg was & feint, designed to amuse them, while the main attack upon Richmond is to come from another quarter. Upon this theory they now beUeveourforce 5n front of Fredericksburg iu reality to be small, and that Immense hosts are being em barked at Bell Plains and conveyed in trans ports up the James River. Acting upon this idea, they have re-commenced erecting earth works for the protection of a garrison force, while the mein body of their army has com menced moving toward Richmond, A special dispatch is as follows: . Opposite Fredericksburg, Nov. 30.— The rebels still continue to forlity vigorously on their second line.

Tt is believed in official quarters that the rebel force about Fredericksburg and within call is from 100,000 to 133,000. No supplies of vegetables have yet been distributed, though they were promised sever* si days ago. Billions diseases and symptoms cf scurvy grow worse.

Ho clue has been obtained to the perpetrators. McYickeh’s Theatre. —Mr. Booth was welcomed on Monday night by a large audi ence, and last evening by a still larger one, both of which were delighted with his deline ation. TTis engagement bids fair to be the most successful of the present prosperous season at the theaire. To-night he appears in Shylock, the Jew, in.Shakespeare’s play of the “Merchant of Venice,” with Miss Hosmer as Portia, and Mr. McVickcr as Launcelot Gobbo. Funs.—Thos. B, Morris & Co., 107 Randolph street, state that, notwithstanding the great scarcity and high price of mink skins, they have now on hand ne of the largest stocks of Ladles’ Mink Furs in the city, in all the most fashionable shapes now worn, and manufac tured in a manner that cannot be surpassed. They have, also, a large stock ot other fur goods—Hats and Caps—which they announce their readiness to tell as low as they can be purchased in New York. Cheap Books. —lt is a well known fact that paper, and the other component parts neces* eary to make a*hcok, have recently advanced about 100 per cent. We may therefore readi ly suppose that there is to a less number of books published than formerly, while the price of those hereafter issued from the press will he about doubled. In view of these facta a handsome margin is affording by purchasing books* at Bamford & Baldwin’s, No. 13 Lake street. They arc said to he selling new books at one-hall the old rates, though this chance will not he offered hut for a few days to come. Tire Soldiers’ Aid Festival.— There was a fine company at Bryan Hall last evening, and the receipts, we are happy to say, reached a handsome sum.

Lectukes on Astbonomt,— By the’advertlsc ment in another column It will ho seen that at the earnest solicitation of some of our lead ing citizens, Prof. .Tory, of New York, mil commence a course of lectures on Astronomy at Bryan Hall, Thursday evening, December 4th. ‘The character of the gentlemen who have invited Prof. F. is a guarantee to our citizens that the course will be no ordinary affair, hut one thoroughly worthy of their pat ronage. Persons who have heard his lectures in the East speak of them as deeply interest ing, and, though eminently scientific, yet brilliant and popular In form, hitting the tastes alike of educated men and the million. The subject is one of the loftiest that can en gage human attention; the object of the lec tures—viz ;to provide an Astronomical Ob servatory, with a powerful telescope, for our city is one which shgnld appeal to the local pride of all our citizens. Xlie Joint Committee on the Canal Enlargement.

COOK COUNTY POO a HOUSE. Annual Visit ot the Board of Super* Tlsoni. According to previous notice given on Mon day, the Board of Supervisors met yesterday morning, at 10 o’clock, and at once proceed ed in carriages to the County Poor House, ar riving there at half past twelve. It is located In the town of Jefferson, about ten miles from the city limits in a northwesterly direction. After “thawing out,” (for the ride was an exceedingly cold one,) the official visitors were shown through the various buildings, and received explanations In regard to matters of importance, from Mr. Benj. Chase, who has had charge of the institution for the past three years. He has made extensive improve ments in every department, and a member who has for several years made an annual visit to the Institution, says he has never seen matters both Inside the house and upon the farm in as good condition as they appear to be at present. The matron, Mrs. Chase, and her assistants, keep the interior remarkably neat, notwithstanding the adverse character of the mass of inmates. THE HOSPITALS. In the Male Department there are on an average about fifty patients; the number in the winter always being much larger than during the summer. Most of the cases are of a chronic and incurable character, such as rheumatism, ulcers, consumption, and para lysed limbs. One of the inmates has both legs amputated, from having been frost bit ten ; another has completely lost the use of his limbs, and several are deformed. The principal inmates of the Female De partment are aged women, who have no special diseases, except those Incident to old age. There is one case of rheumatism, com pletely disabling the patient. The room oc cupied as a nursery has now four young in fants with their nurses. Two old German women, who have each been there seven years, attracted considerable attention. Cath arine Singer is cighty-two years old, and seems patiently waiting for the end of life; the other does not remember her age, but says she is “plenty old.” Both are happy and contented. THE INSANE WARD, The number of insane, of both sexes Is thirty-six, about equally divided—the males slightly predominating. Of these probably one-third are incurable. The number of inmates on the 30th of May, was 203; The present number 180. Two years agp the building was fall, now there are sev eral vacant rooms. THE 

FARM. In the farm there are about 200 acres. It is eligibly situatedupon the first elevated ground northwest from the city, and is being rapidly brought to a good state of cultivation. The farm produced 1,000 bu. potatoes, 100 bu. on ions, CO bu. navy beans, 900 bu. beets, and all the hay, com, oats, &c., that will be needed up to the next harvest. Last year the broom, com was raised and 800 excellent brooms manufactured, about fifty dozen are still ou hand. This year enough broom com has been produced for 1,000 brooms, but having no workmen, the com will be held over. These brooms are generally made by the pau pers, the only cost to the county being the handles and wire. Enough flax was raised to manufacture 200 yards of coarse linen. The stock consists of nine milch cows, five year lings, and six horses—all good stock, and in' good condition. The improvements made in the out-build ings, as well as In the various departments of the main building, and the condition of affairs everywhere, indicate that Mr. Chase is doing his duty faithfully. The Board enjoyed the hospitality of the "Warden, in the shape of an excellent dinner, which would indicate anything else than Poo r fare. The guests awarded just credit to the managers of the culinary department The company reached the city about 8 p. m., apparently well satisfied with what they had stem BOARD OF EDUCATION. The members of the Board of Education held their regular monthly meeting yesterday aitemoon at their rooms. President Haven occupied the chair, and there was present Messrs.

Dickenson, assistant in same school; Celia E. Stowe, as sistant In same school; Sophronia A. Barker, assistant in the Scammon school; Miss Fair man, at large. JANITORS. Mr. Sheehan, from the proper committee, said it was very difficult to Hud janitors who would work for the salary allowed by the Board, and the Committee had been compelled to advance the wages. He offered the follow ing: Ordered, That the Committee oh Janitors and Supplies*, and any other committee that may now or hereafter have authority to increase the expen ditures of the Board, bo required to report from time to time a detailed statement of each expendi tures. Mr. Wentworth wanted to know if any com mittee of this Board had the right to expend the school fund ad libitum, The President replied that the Committee on Janitors had been authorized to employ janitors and pay them. Mr. Sbeaban explained that all committees, in his opinion, ought to report monies paid, to the Beard. He instanced the committee hav ing the cut of Haven School in charge, of which Mr, Wentworth is a member. Mr. Wentworth answered that all he paid for cuts, the gentlemanjcould put in his eye. The resolution of Mr. SUeahan wasadopted. ' men school. Mr, Taft said that Mr. Merrymsn had pro cured better furniture for the High School than was ordered by the committee, and it was right that an amount equal to the extra expenditure he has made, be refunded. The subject, on his motion was referred to the com mittee on apparatus and furniture. . Many complaints having been made touch ing the heating apparatus in the High School, Mr. Ward explained that the furnaces did. not work well and it was not easy to keep the house warm in cold weather. He thought, however, that there was no suffering on the part of the children from cold. By next win ter the present apparatus would be worn out and then a new one can be-pnt in. Mr. Wicker asked what would become of the children’s health in the meantime. Mr. Ward thought there would be no diffi culty of that kind. THE 

SLIPPER QUESTION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL, Mr. Wentworth had been informed that on the next day after the last meeting some of the boys at the High School had crowed over their teacher, ou account of what they sup posed to have been the action of the Board in relation to wearing slippers in the school He asked that the rule instituted by the Prin cipal might be either rescinded or adopted by this Board. Hr. "Wicker presented a petition from the male students of tlie High School, setting forth their grievances, and in choice, though positive language, they declared themselves “ free and independent” of slippers, for ever* more—provided the Board willing. Hr. "Wentworth felt disposed to oppose the abrogation of the role. The bays were “on their Fourth of July,” and need combing down. Mr. Carpenter was opposed to any such rule. Slippers were good In their place; bat they were ont of place when compelled to be worn in a cold room with the thermometer at 50 deg. Hr. Taft held the same views. Mr. Holden deemed it a fight, aided mate rially by the Board, between the boys and the teacher. He opposed an abrogation ol the rule, as it would give the boys a comoiete triumph over the teacher. The boots do make a great deal of noise, particularly when the boys feel that the Board Is backing them up. Through this petition the boys expect to com plete theirtriumph. Hr. Newberry was not in favor of accept ing the petition. The precedent was not a good one. It would induce insubordination. Hr. Prinderville believed it to be impossi ble 1 o heat a room so that it would be healthy, and still have one floor sufficiently comforta ble to wesr slippers without injury. Hr. Newberry was decidedly anti-slipper, he want ed that understood. Hr. "Wentworth suggested a pathological examination. Let the delicate ones wear their boots if necessary, hut do not do away the rule at present. Hr. Carpenter said the boys had borne with the slipper orders, but rebelled when the heels were directed to be taken off The question was, heels or so heels. Several of the gentlemen became quite ani mated in their remarks, and the president thonghttbe Board had “an elephant to dispose of.” __ Hr. Steele knew that the boys who had signed the memorial believed the matter in volved to he of more importance than Bum side did the attack on Fredericksburg. Hr. Wicker.—Undoubtedly. After some dozen or two resolutions, amendments, substitutes, and divers other matters, had been offered, seconded, debated and withdrawn, the following resolutions of fered by Hr. Sbeahan, were adopted: JStsrJved, That the Board decline repealing the rule of the High School requiring the use of slip pers by the boys during school hours. Beiotvedy That the rules-of the High School be referred to the Committee on High School for such examination and revirion as they may deem ad visable. , ' : 

AMENDING THE BULBS. The able report nude by Ur. Sheahan at the last regular meeting on “Head Assistants In the primary schools” was then taken up arid the rules of the Board were amended so as to conform to the recommendations in that re port, and The Board adjourned. iiA.tr intelligence, Settlement of tlie Suits Against the Illinois Central Railroad for Sam ages at tlioHyae I'arK Accident.

The trial of these suits, it was expected, would occupy tbe greater part of the present term of the Superior Court, nnd the counsel who represented both norcies had made ample preparation lor a spirited contest. "We feel a pleasure in announcing this result under all the circumstances so satisfactory. We congrat ulate the public* who are spared a pain ful review of a terrible disaster,—the Court and jury, who are relieved from a tedious investigation, and the company for an exhibition of a liberality which goes far to prove tbat, although destitute of a soul, It has at least the elements of a conscience.

M.OJS BTAKT. Tuesdat Evenino, Dec. 2,1565. The money market continues active; but bust- i ness is moving along so gently and smoothly that scarcely any variation can be noticed from day to day. Bankers report a good supply of paper mak ing, and on all hands notes are promptly met. The very small margin between the buying and selllugratCß of exchange is just now their only source of complaint. The vast amount of -busi ness now doing and its safe and substantial char acter, we doubt not will folly make up for the low rates of exchange. They are strictly just, as there can scarcely be a doubt that for many months past the balance of trade has been in favor of our city and of the Northwest, and to our mercantile community they are specially acceptable. New York exchange remains at yesterday’s quo tations, viz: par buying and tf selling. Some of the heavier discount bouses sell round lots at 1-10 ; to best customers. A few leading houses sell at u premium, but the rate is above the market. The brokers bought gold to-day at 30 percent, premium. We refer to our dispatches for the fig ures ruling ic New York. • The first dispatches made the rate there 3ltf. Old Demand Treasury Notes ■were "bought at 24. Silver, large coins, 2ft@,23.

During the past week the grocery market has ruled rather inactive, although at the.time we write, there is a slight improvement, as country merchants are beginning to make their appear ance, in order to purchase their supplies .for the coming holidays. The market for Haw Sugars is quiet and tends to a slight decline, consequent upon tne large re ceipts expected from the sugar districts of Louis iana. Our latest advices from New Orleans state that there have been receipts of the new crop, and although being light, they exceed the demand. There is no disposition on the part of purchasers to operate at the present prices, owing to the an ticipated liberal receipts from the upper dis tiicte. Eeftnzd are quiet at a decline of H . Coffees are in a light supply, and the market is quiet at Sl@34K for common to prime Bio, and 36@88 for Java.

Java in small lots is still selling at 85. ana St. Domingo at 89c fi fi>, cash. The imports during the present year have thus far fallen tbort of those of last up wards of 20 COO hags* and it is understood there is more on the way from or loading at Kio, for the ’United States. . The estimated stocks of Bio in first hands in the principal markets are, accorcing to the circu lar of Wm, Scott & Sons, as follows: Baltimore, 2.0C0 lags; Philadelphia, none; New York, 87,933 hags.
