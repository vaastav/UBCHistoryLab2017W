PRESIDENT'S MESSAGI. bl r,:pesident Cleveland has given hiis last message to congress. Like mtost I of Mr. Cluesveai.d's state papers i. i tl rdlumto, ous ; muoch too long for:. tjhe t splac,.f .a .veekly papIer. Therere.-are te only a few.: portions needing corn-. :nent, and, thesos mainly beeause of tle splace the president has taicn in w licl to- say practically. nothing. Mr. Cleveland has. n solaution.for the d Armenian question,. only a delusive " hope that the Turk will stop killing inoffensive people before the race is. extinct. Ills reference to the ques tion closes with this platitude: "I r do not believe that the present som ber prospect in Turkey will be long d permi.tted to offend the sight r of. Crhristendoomt:. IZt so, mars the t uqmlane and. enliglhtened,. etLili'a tign thbat bclpngs to the close of the f nipeteentlt,century, that it seems Tlardly .posible that the earnest de- a mrnd of good people throughout the a Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered." As if trusting in the eflicacy of;prayer t to stay the hancl of murderous Turks : whecre their o n.. religion teaches to I kill. The .president; is. a- master of the art of saying notllisrg gracefully. 1ile would zoal:e a. goeo pastor for a . ahllionable-ohurclr. On the Culan question. Cleveland it- equaily non-committal. 1e .is . wasteful with words, but they seem to be used mainly in justifying his o'6Wn course on the question. lIe gies the struggling Cubans no hope ofhlelp from tire present administra tion, and only declares that, a time may come at solne ,li.stan.day, when, after having gain..Lliberty through their own valor and .suffTring,.the patriouts of Cuba may expect that recognition from. the lUnited..States that can ie- longer be witlhheld. This portion of the nmessage is decid edly disappointing to th!e nlat5ss of the American people.. The rest of the message is mainly devoted to statistics. It gan.not be accorded veery high ranc ,asa..state paper.

SENATO'RS. i They Arc Invited to Attend a R-gular. ai: Republican Caucus. Washimngton, Dec. .--When the Tit D determination was reached to hold a fr: t republican caucus tomorrow, an in- th a teresting situation at once presented M itsecf. The silver republican sena- m tors who bolted the St. Louis plat- do form and. ticket, were an unakeown quaptity iy n. thlcirpresent, affiliations,. and whetlpr or.not to invite them to attend thec caucus was .at, undecided bi e matter. MIany conferene0s were held: Sen atbo Chandler being particularly ac r tive in recommending that the bolt s ers be notified of tile caucus which is o practically an invitation to attend. Senator Chandler took the position of that the votes of these men would - be needed in passing a tariff bill, a Senator Quay, it is understood,.took, the same view. It was linally con eluded that.noti es should be sent. to, tbem as before. This result placed ; the burden of action on the silvecr re :m publicans. They conferred until late. his in the night to settle the line of Ie policy. Senator Dubois of Idaho is, or was, ) secretary of the caucus. 11 . will re a- sign this place, as lie hias been more me active than many of tile others in Sthe recelnt campaign and was one of Sthe most urgent in the adv ocacy of a bogl lt at St. Louis. TIhere lhs been a the tendency amonlg some republicans to hlt pursue a conciliatory course towards t is the silver republicans, and especially as a number:nof tlhent have declared in favor of protection,. and Senator - Mantle's paper has been quite positive of in this direction. It is not believed eitller Senators PIttigrew., Mantle or my Cannon will attend the caucus, al thouiigh they would not be required be to give their views. ate 'he cancus is to outline a program for the session.

Dec. 6.-A and- special .to the Citizen from Key West :ton, says:- The steamer Whitney brought the Blavana .news this morning in rela d by tion to Maceo and Weyler. . Passen ident gers state that- ..Weyler himself is t re- now encamped ten miles from Ar er to temisa and his army is -scattered cs.- ;ilong the trocha and through the Pinar del Rio district. When MaC6o :tman retreated. from Weyler in his first isn't campaign his first' plan was to sur~ erb b prise Weyler at the first opportuni Wel , ty.and now Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler and they are en he .haing daily skirmishes, Weyler is completely surrounded and if he shalil atteimpt to move he will be cut.us cosipelled to go to Arteinisa.

Butte hunters who have been gun Iiuig for fowl, jack rabbits and other game ill ti vicinity of Sheridan during tlhe past fall, report a strange bird i!l thla llucality. Tile feathered strlanger is supp1osed to be a white groseo, but old.iunters say that such a thijgi wise nev'er.known and all at tempts to cultivate the acquaintance of the bird have be.n repulsed. Tile winged anomaly is the, leader of a flock of groouse whlose headquarters are in a rookery near the town of Sheridan. No gunner, be he over so expert, has been able to get, withlin shooting distance of tle flook, andi they were never surprised but once. That was when. "'Punk" artlett a. few weeks ago camped on their trail for a whole. da., resolved to isoe tile mystery of the white- bird. 'iefore lie couldt get his shpoting ironls ad justed the :whitewasbhea leader scent ed dasnger and. gave tho alarm. Mr. Bartlett swears that the bird. whis tled "Just tell them that you saw me" as it. passed over his. head, and recovering from his surprise, he took aim.and fired.. The shot, tore out two white tati feathers which, Mr. STBartlett now pouoidly exhibits to his f Sfriends. l-e is still wondering what the "doggoned" bird is doing on 1 Montana soil and thinks it will be a Smascot for the man that brings it down,--lnotr Mountain.0 . An Extra Session. e Washington,. Dee.. 3.--"It would be dilliult to say. what we did not discuiss- at, Canton: yesterday," said Congressman Babcock this afternoon, ii "for I believe President-elect Mc Kinley and. myself discussed eyory- b i thing in tile range: of personal.. and . politicial affairs during my visit. i Lt was ,an enjoy'able visit in every i sense and I was surprised to find how a well Major McKinley has .borne.up under the strain to which he has n been subjected for so many months. le was apparently as fresh as. the day we started the campaign and sh.owed none-, of tle effects that r O might have been expected from the arduous labors imposed upon him. '"One thiing may be set down as certain, there will be an extra ses r- sion of congress and a new tariff bill. ie It is the desire of the president-elect in that this course shall be pursued, and f inaturally enough his wishes will be d'eferred to. In regard to the con i tinuance of headquarters. at Wash rl ington, that depends in a. measure on the wishes of the national commit ry Lee.. As soon as congress meets oour committee will be called togeth er for :a conference with t-hemembers of the national body, so that onr ac tr rionis may. be hlurmonious. Runt Pardoned But Executed.. Paul Key West, .Fla., Dec. 7.-Nearly erval every day something develops to add Sh to the infamy of Weyler. It nowrroci transp!res, thatr. when Lopez. Coloma Davi was shot: Weyler. had been. notified ,thei that tile queen had pardoned- the liabi prisoner. Coloma surrendered under ,mm the amnesty proclamation issued by Martinez Campos when the latter In was captlin-general. Campos was last indignant at Wexyler's conduct in or- of g dering Coloma shot, and appealed to post the queen. The latter signed a par- to a don for Coloma and it was cabled to envi Weyler, reachi'ng him at noon on the T day set for Coloma's execution. Wcy- con. ler put the pardon in his pocket and mot ordered thel execution to proceed, ard and the prisoner was shot a. .5 p. m., wa5 five hours after Weyler had been ty t notitied the queen had granted a: lie pardon. en tt No Pardon For Allen. 1 Governor Rickards spent a few fre moments in Deer Lodge Saturday on to his way to Butte.. While there the "li governor was presented with a plea bri for clemency for old man Allen, sue n whose conviction for. manslaughter a Ice Ae few weeks ago,. is- still fresh in the t a public mind. The. petition was pre n sented by Attorney' J. H. Duffy,. of pU le Anaconda,.and was signed by all of ba le the twelve jlurors who convicted ni e Allen. The plea set forth that on pe a account of tile old age and infirmity go an of the murderer and the. fact that he ti s- has a brother in Ohio who ha.s offered 'w re to care for him the remainder of his ci is days, the state executive is ask.d, to or- exercise his power.of.pardon... nd Governor RlickaTde,; in replying to on Mr Duffy, said:.;:"Under no consid oration can: .enttertain::.the. matter O seriously.: it is out of :tlo:.question toconsider such a proposition com ingiso soon after the maons con-vic ht: tion.' m The governor further said he er- would file the document in his ofice, . ionI but would, not hold out any hope'for t ;on- the granting of the petition.
