Washington, Dec. 9.—Members of the South Dakota delegation in con gress commented on. President Taft's message as follows:" Senator Gamble—"I regard the message as able, clear and compre hensive. I especially commend the position of the president in the use he is to make cf the new tariff board in securing data as to the cost or production of manufactured articles at home and abroad. The recom mendation in regard to the economi cal administration of the government will meet the approval of the country. 1 am confident the special messages which he has prom.sed on these and related subjects will meet the ap proval and expectation of the people.' Senator Crawford—"1 am especial ly pleased with the construction the president places' upon the maximum and minimum clause in the tariff act. He makes it very clear that in his judgment the cases will be rare in deed in which the maximum rate will be enforced, if ever. 1 am also much pleased with his declared intention to make the utmost out of the pro vision for a tariff commission in the new tariff law, and liis further state ment that if the facts' secured by the tariff board show generally that the rates imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection as described in the party platform, he will not hesitate to call the attention of congress to the situ ation and necessity for reductions in the duties in such cases. As to the recommendation of the president concerning ship subsidies I do not wish to commit myself until I have seen the full text of the bills which may be offered. My expressions have not been favorable to legislation granting bounties to ship owners, and I do not believe the people of South Dakota are friendly to the pin ciple. Representative Martin— "On the subjects the president touches in his message, his views are quits satis itetory to me and to the western country. I am disappointed that he iias postponed most v: th-j impor tant items until later messages. I be ii ve this delay has somewhat weak ened Lis position on tln^ij more ser ious subjects. I am i" full accord with the presidents views on pootal savings banks and other subjects dis cussed by him, except the ship sub jsidy, which I am opposed to The president's interpretation of the, au thority of the tariff commission is 'very gratifying and a decided ste I in the direction of gathering imomia tion l'cr tariff purposes." Representative Burl'?.—"I am es pecially pleased with the president's statement that to continue the dis cussion of the tariff revision would be harmful to the business interests of the country, and I am glad he came out squarely in discouraging further legislation on the tariff at this time, in the main it is a message such as would be expected from Taft, con servative, and yet he shows he expects to take a stand and support legisla tion in favor of the people."

VESSEY ON TAFT'S MESSAGE. Pierre, S. D., Dec. 13.—Governor Vessey on being asked his views on HI I 57 the message of President ftlt, gave out the following: "That message re cently transmitted to coiigress by President Taft is, generally speaking a comprehensive one. The decided stand taken In regard to reducing the cost of administration Is import ant and especially so In connection with the army, and navy depart ments. 5 "The formation of a tariff board and Its compilation of an encyclo paedia of the terms used and articles embraced In the tariff law is judi cious. I appreciate the statement that there will be a revision of the tariff law if it should result that the platform pledges are not observed or are Insufficient. "The especial attention which the Sherman Anti-Trust and similar laws will receive is commendable. The
