S. Trude is practically in charge of Dan Coughlin' defense, nnd that every move made on be- Itnlf of the prisoner has been done at the suggestion or by direction of that promi nent attorney. Mr. Trude lias not ap peared openly in the rase as yet, but it is said that when the hearing reaches the stage where the evidence is to bs pre sented he will take his seat at the table ot counsel for the defense. It is known to the state, so it is said, that the different moves of the defense ever since Coughlin's return from Ji.liet prisou were made only after the plans l.ad been submitted to Mr. Trude and approved by him. His valuable counsel h is hceu sought at every point, and great hones have been fostered in the breasts of Coughlin's frietrls because of the understand,:!;; that Mr. Trude would help the defcii?.

He is not nearly so hopeful now as he was during the lirst trial. Three years m the penitentiary has almost broken his spirit, and his extierience in the stoneyard at Joliet imbued hitu with so great a hor ror of piisou that he sj'i.l to a reporter recently that he won id rather be hangi than sent back to Joliet, and he added: "If 1 knew nnv story that could buy by lib erty Id only bu too glad to tell it." Defense in Sore atraits. The defense not Pan Coughliu alone, but those, also, whose association with the crime is felt rather than known has des perate need just now of such a man. The fabric of conspiracy, lyiug, .perjury and murder that houstd them from the public gazs is going to pieces fast aud may cjiue tumbling down about their ears like a house of cards at any moment. Money tor the Defense. Where the money rtquired to pay tka great expense of the ileiense in this trial came from was a puzzle to the prosecution until &u investigation was set ou foot which discovered the source of revenue. In the last trial the "camps" of the Clan na-(lael which remained loyal to the anti Crouiu faction voluntarily assessed themselves to pay the cost of defending men who had ouly killed "spv," which they did not regard mur der. Now, however, tbe coutrol of the Clan-na-Gael has passed absolutely from the hands of the murder eud of the orgau izatjon. Besides that, a number of tho leading Irishmen of Chicago, men w hose names have never been mentioned in connection with the factional rights of the clan, nave tabeu the matter up am have declared that no money raised to aid the Irish iu Ireland shall be applied to the. defense of Coughliu. It is said that funds for the defense in the present triil came from local politicians of loth par ties.
