PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. To tfce Senate ltd House of Representatives: In transmitting to you my fourth annual message, it is with thankful ness to the Giver of all good, that as a nation we have been blessed for the last year with peace at home and aoroad, and a general prosperity vouchsafed to but few people. With the exception of the recent devastat ing fire, which swept from earth with & breath, as it were, millions of accu mulated wealth in the city of Boston, there has been no overshadowing calamities within the year to record. It is gratifying to note how like their fellow citizens of the city of Chica go under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston . are rallying under their misfortune, and the prospect is that their ener gy and perseverance will overcome all obstacles and show the same prosperity sexm that they would have shown, had not disaster befal len them. Otherwise, we have been free from pestilence, war, and calam ities, which often overtake nations, and as far as human judgment can penetrate the future, no cause seems to exist to threaten our present peace. THE 

ALABAMA ARBITRATION. Vhen Congress last, a question had been raised by Great Britain and was then pending, which for a time seriously imperil led the settlement by friendly arbi tration of the differences existing between this government and that of Her Britannic Majesty by the treaty of Washington had been referred to the tribunal of arbitration which had met at Geneva in Switzerland. The arbitrators, however, disposed of the question which had jeopardized the whole of the treaty, and seriously threatened to involve the two na tions in most unhappy relations to wards each other. In a manner en tirely satisfactory to this Govern ment, and in accordance with the views and the policy which it had maintained, the Tribunal which had convened at Geneva m December, concluded its laborious session on the 14th day of September last, on which day having availed itself of the discretionary power erven to it by the Treaty, to award a sum in gross, it made its decision whereby it awarded the sum of $15,500,000 in gold as the indemnity to be paid by Great Britain to the United States, for the satisfaction of all the claims referred to its consideration. This decision happily disposes of a long standing difference between the - two Governments, and in connection with another award made by the German Emperor, under a reference to him by the 6arae treaty, leaves these two Governments without a shadow upon the friendly relations which it is my sincere hope may for ever remain equally unclouded. The report of the agent of the United States appointed to attend the Gene va Tribunal, accompanied by the protocols of the proceedings of the arbitrators, the arguments of the counsel of both Governments, the award of the Tribunal, and the opin- ions given by the several arbitrators, is transmitted herewith. OUR GRATITUDE. 1 nave eaused to be communicat ed to the heads of the three friendly JAJltCH KUU CUIiipueU Wlbli me JOini request made to them under the Treaty, the thanks of this Govern ment for the appointment of arbitra tors made by them respectively, and also my tnanks to the eminent per nonages named by them, and my ap preciation of the dignity, patience, impartiality and great ability with which they discharged their arduous and high functions. Her Majesty's Government has communicated to me its appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and indefatigable in- dustry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator named on the part of this during the political in- quiries and discussions of the Trib-1 unal I cordially unite with Her Maj- esty in tnis appreciation. It is due to the agent of the U. S. before the tribunal to record my high apprecia tion ot tue marked ability unwearied . patience, and the prudence and dis cretion with which he has conduct- ed the very responsible and delicate duties committed to mm, and it is aho due to the learned and eminent counsel who attended the Tribunal on the part of this government, to express my sense of the talent and wisdom which they brought to bear on the argument and result so hap- pily reached. It will be in the prov- idence of Congress to provide for the distribution among those who may be entitled to it of their respective suares oi tne money to oe paid, Although the sum awarded is not payaDie until a year lrom the date of the award, it is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of the several cases in wnicn inaemnincation may due. I consequently recommend the creation of a Board of Commis Bioners for the THE SAN JUAN CASE. By the thirty-fourth article of the Treaty of Washington, the resoec tive claims of the United States and of Great Britain in their construction of the Treaty of the 15th of June. 1846, defining the boundary line be- tween tneir respective territories were submitted to the arbitration. and the award of his Majesty the Jbmperor or Germany, to decide which of those claims is most in ac cordance with the true interpreta tion oi tne treaty or 1846. His maj esty, tne emperor ot Germany, hay- ing been pleased to undertake the arbitration, has the earnest thanks ui mio huv eminent ana oi tne PeoDle line unitea states ior the labor, pains and care which he has devot ed to the consideration of this lon- pending difference. I have caused an expression of my thanks to be communicated to nis majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this Government at Berlin conducted the case and prepared the statement on the the part of the United States with the ability that his past ser vice justified the public in expecting at nis Hands. As a member of the Cabinet at the date of the treaty, which has given rise to the discus- eion between the two governments; as me .minister to Great Britain when the construction now pro- nouncea uniounaed was first advanr, ed; and as the agent and represent- ative oi uie government, to present case and to receive the award J Tie has been associated with the ques- won uiauui its pnases, and in every eiage ua manuesiea a patriotic zeal and earnestness in tne maintenance of the claim of the United States. He is entitled to much credit for the success which has attended the sub mission. After a patient investiga tion of the case and of the stat- menis oi eacn party. His JVlaiestv. the Emperor, on the 21st day of Oc- jober last, signed his award in writ- ing, decreeing that the claim of the trovernment of the United States. . . t v, i- . f T'- nMivJf'1 ntines of her BntannicMaiestv nH 1 .

It is my grateful duty to acknowl edge the prompt and spontaneous action of Her Majesty's Government in giving effect to the award, in an ticipation of any request from this government and before the reception in the United States of the award signed by the Emperor. Her Majes ty had given instructions for the re moval of hex troops which had been stationed there, and for the cessa tion of all exercise or claim of juris diction, so as to leave the United States in exclusive possession of the lately disputed territory. I am grateful to be able to announce that the orders for the removal of the troops have been executed and the military joint occupation of San Ju an has ceased. The islands are now in the exclusive possession of the United States. THE 

DECISION ACKNOWLEDGED. It now becomes necessary to com plete the survey and determination of that portion of the boundary line tnrougu tlic Haro Channel upon which the Commission which deter mined the remaining part of the line were unable to agree. I recommend the appointment of a Commission to act jointly with one which maybe named ry tier Majesty tor tnat pur- pose. Experience ot tne dmiculties attending the determination of our admitted line of boundary after the occupation of the territory and its settlement cy tnose owing auegi- giance to the respective govern I ments, points to the importance of establishing by natural objects or otner monuments, tne actual line be- tween the territory acquired by pur chase from Russia and the adjoining possessions of Her Britannic JMajes ty. The region is now so sparcely oc cupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or of jurisdiction are likely to interfere to the delay or embarrassment of the actual location of the line. If deferred until popu lation 6hall enter and occupy the territory some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two governments in antagonism. I there fore recommend the appointment of a commission to act jointly with one that may be appointed on the part of Great Britain to determine the line of our territory of Alaska and the entermmous possessions of Great Britain. THE CANADA FISHERIES. I I whether any action by Congress in the direction indicated would be government come important. This question has I I In my last annual message I. rec ommended the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles of I MC a-scuty w iiiguuigwuui -luaj 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other matters touching the relations of the United States toward the British North American possessions to become operative so soon as the proper legislation should be had on the part of Gieat Britain and the I North American Possessions. That legislation on the part of Great Brit- ain and its possessions had not then been had, and during the session of Congress a question was raised which for a time raised a doubt since been discussed, and I have re- ceived notice that the Imperial Par- uanient ana tne legislature or the provincial government have passed awe to carry the provisions of the treaty in the matter referred to into operation. I therefore recommend your early adoption of the legisla- I tion in the same direction necessary on tne part oi this government The joint commission for deter mining the boundary line between the United States and British pos sessions, between the Lake of the Woods and the Rocky Mountains, has organized and entered upon its work. It is desirable that the force be increased, in order that the com pletion of the survey and the d termination of the line may the soon er oe attained, to this end. and I recommend that a sufficient appro pnation be made. FOREIGN RELATIONS. I mena oi tne United fctates, Ger be many, with whose government and our ally.

I commend the subject strongly to your consid eration, and recommend that an ad equate appropriation be made for the purpose to further aid the American exhibitors at the Vienna Exposition. 1 would recommend in addition to an appropriation of money, that the Secretary of the Navy be author ized to fit up two naval vessels to transport between our Atlantic cities and Trieste or the most convenient port to Vienna, and back, their ar ticles for exhibition. MATTERS IN MEXICO. Since your last session the Presi dent of the Mexican Republic, dis tinguished by his character and by his services to his country, has died. His temporary successor .has now been elected witn great unanimity by the people, a proof of confidence on their part in his patriatism and wisdom which it is believed will be confirmed by the results of his ad ministration. It is particularly de sirable that nothing should be left undone by the Government or eitoer Republic to strengthen their rela tions as neighbors and friends. It is much to be regretted that many law less acts continue to disturb the quiet of the settlements on the bor der between our territory and that of Mexico, and that the complaints of wrong to American citizens in various parts of the country are made. The revolutionary condition in which the neighboring Republic has so long been involved, has in some degree contributed to this dis turbance. It is to be hoped that with a more settled rule of order through the Republic, which may be expected from the present govern ment, the acts of which just com plaint is made will cease. The pro ceedings of the commission under convention with Mexico, of 4th of July, 1868, on the subject of claims, have unfortunately beeu checked by an obstacle, for the removal of which measures have been taken by the two governments, which it is be lieved will prove successful. The Commissioners appointed pursuant to the joint sessions of Congress of the 7th of May last, to inquire into the depredations on the Texas fron tier, have diligently made investiga tions in that quarter. That report upon the subject will be communi cated to you. Their researches were necessarily incomplete, partly on ac count of the limited appropriation made by the Congress. Mexico, on the part of that government, has ap pointed a similar commission to in vestigate these outrages. It 13 not announced ollicially, but the press of that country states that the fullest investigation is desired, and that the co-operation of all parties concerned is invited, to secure that end therefore recommend that a special appropriation be made at the earh est dar practicable to enable the Commissioners on the part of the United States to return to their la bors without delay. THE 

CONDITION OF CUBA. It is with regret that I have again to announce the continuance of the disturbed condition of the Island of Cuba. No advance toward the pa cification of the discontented part of the population has been made, while the insurrection has gained vantages and exhibit no more elements of power or of the prospect of ultimate success, than were exhib - ited a year ago. Spam, on the other hand, nas not succeeded in its re pression, and the parties stand ap parently in the same relative attitude which they have occupied for a long time past. This contest has lasted now for more than four j-ears. Were it seen at a distance from our neigh borhood, we might be indifferent to its result, although humanity could not be unmoved by many of its inci dents, whereever they might occur. It is, however, at our door. I can not doubt that the continued main tamance ol slavery in Cuba, is among the strongest inducements to the continnance of this strife. A terrible wrong, is the natural cause of a terrible evil. The abolition of slavery and the introduction of oth-1 er reforms in the administration of government fh Cuba, could not fail to advance the restoration of peace and order. It is especially to be hoped, that the present liberal government of Spain will voluntarily adopt this view, no ad-1 of the THE 

OUTRAGE OF HUMAN BONDAGE. The law of emancipation, which was passed more than two years since, has remained unexecuted. In the absence of regulations for its en forcement, it was but a leeble step toward emancipation, but it was the recognition of right and was hailed as such and exhibited Spam in bar mony with sentiments of humanity and justice, and in sympathy with t.h nt.hcr mwcnnf tllo hn'olian 7 . . r civilized world. Within the past few weeks the regulations for carry- ilftt.iona for narrtr. ing out the laws of emancipation have been announced, giving evi-1 dence or the sincerity of the mten- tion of the present Government to carry into effect the law of 1870. I hfLve not fnilpri to lirae the fnnairloi.- justice of a more effective system for the abolition of a great evil which oppressed a race and continues a b.oody and destructive contest close to our borders,as well as the expedi ency and the justice of conceding reiorms ot which tne propriety is not questioner, deeply impressed with the conviction that the continuance of slavery is one of the most active causes of the continuance of the un. happy condition in Cuba, I regret to believe that citizens of tne United States, or those claiming to be such. large noiuers in uuba of what is claimed as property, but which is -wuuv, ujr uitmiis of the Lnited btates.

In my last annual message I referred to this subject, and I again recommend such legislation as inv be proper to denounce, and if not to prevent, at least to discourage Amer ican citizens from holding or dealing in siaves. - OUR 

NEIGHBORS IN PEACE. It is gratifying to announce that tlie ratilication ot the convention unaer tne auspices oi tnis govern ment, between Spain, on the one part ana tne Auiea Jttepuoncs or tne Fa cine on the other, providing for an armistioe, nave been exchanged. A copy of the instrument is herewith submitted. It is hoped that this may be followed by a permanent peace between the same parties. THE SOCTn AMERICAN STATES.

This- subject is again recommended to the attention of Congress for such action as may be deemed proper. THE ASIATIC NATIONS. , I Our treaty relations with Japan remain uncuangea. An imposing embassy from that interesting and progressive nation visited this count ry during the year that is passing, but being unprovided with powers for the signing of a convention in this country, no conclusion in that direction was reached. It is hoped. however,that the interchange of opin ion which took place during their stay in this country has led to a mu tual appreciation of the interests which may be promoted when revis ion of the present treaty shall be undertaken. In this connection I renew my recommendation of one year ago, tnat to give importance and to add to tne efficiency oi our diplomatic relations with Japan and China, and to further aid in retain ing the good opinion of these peo ple, and to secure to the United States its share of the commerce destined to flow between these na tions and the balance of the commer cial world, an appropriation be made to support at least four American youths in each of these countries, to serve as a part ot tue omciai iam ily of our minister. Our representa tives would not even then be placed upon an equal with the representa tives of Great Britian or some other powers. As now stated, our repre sentatives in Japan and China have to depend for interpreters and trans lators upon natives of those countris who know our language imperfectly or procure for the occasion the serv ices of employees in foreign business or the interpreters of other foreign Ministers. I renew the recommendation made on a previous occasion of the transfer to the Department ot the Interior, to which they seem more appropriately to belong, of all the power and duties in relation to the Territories, with which the Department of State is now charged by law or by custom. ' 

RELIEF FOR THE DISTRESSED. Congress, from the begining of the government, has wisely made provis - ion for the relief of distressed seamen in foreign countries. No similar provision, however, has hitherto been made tor tne reliet ot citizens in distress abroad other than seamen It is understood to be customary with other governments to authorize consuls to extend such relief to their citizens of subjects in certain cases. A similar authority and an appropn ation to carry it into effect are sug gested in case of citizens of the United State destitute or sick. Un der such circumstences, it is well known that such citizens went to foreign countries in great numbers. there are some who through accident 1 or otherwise became penniless and I Have no mends at Home able to sue - cor tnem.

REVENUES. With the great redaction of taxation bv the acts of Congress at its last session, the expen ditures of the government in collecting the revenue will be much reduced for the next fiscal year. It is very doubtful however, whether any further reduction of so vexatious a burthen upon the people will be practicable tor tne present, ac au events, as a measure o justice to the holders of the nation's certifi catea of indebtedness, 1 would recommend that no, more legislation be had on this sub ject, unless it be to correct errors of omission or commission m the present law until sum cient time has elapsed to prove that it can be done and still leave euflicient revenue to meet the current expenses of the government, pay the interest on the publio debt, and provide lor tue sinajiig iiuiu esuioiisuea oy law.

THE PARDON OF KU KLUX. Applications have been made to me for the pardon of persons convicted of a violation of said acts, upon the ground that clemency in such cases would tend to tranquiliz th pub lio mind; and to test the virtue of that potior. I am disposed, as far aa my senses of justice wiu permit, to give to t&ese applications a fa vorable consideration; but any action thereon is not to be construed as indicating any change in my aetermination to emorce with vigor such an act so long aa the conspiracies and combinations therein named disturbed the peace of the country. It is much to be re gretted, and is regretted by non more than myself, that a necessity has ever existed to execute the Enforcement Act. . No one can desire more than I that the necessity for ap- jiiy wg it uamj never again oe uemanaeo. -DEPASTXXKT OT THB tBTEBIOB. The Secretary of the Interior reports satis factory improvement and progression in each ot the several bureaus under the control of the Interior Department. The work, which in some of them for some years has been, in arrears, has been brought down to a recent date, and in all the current business has been promptly despatched. THE INDIAN POLICY. The policy which was adopted at the begin ning of the Adminstratioa with remrd to the management of the Indians, has bean as sac- cesslul as its most ardent r"n" anticipated, within so short a time. It has reduced the ex penses of their management, decreased their forages npon white settlements, leaves the largest opportunity to the extension of the great Railway through the public domain. and the pushing of settlements into the more remote districts of the country, and at the same time improve the condition of the Indi ans. The policy will be maintained without any change, excepting such as further ex pen eace may show to be necessary to render it more efficient, lie subject of con verting the so caUea Indian territory south of Kansas into a noma ior tne Indians, ana erecting thereon a territorial form of government, is on ot great importance as a complement of the ex isting luoian policy j ne question of remov al to the territory has bees, unseated to man of the tribes resident upon other and less de sirable portions of the publio domain, and ha generally oeen received by them with favor. As preliminary step to the organization of such a territory, it will be necessaay to confine the Indians now resident therein to farm of proper size, which should be secured for them in tne residue to be used for the settlement of other friendly Indians. E Sorts wiU be made in the immediate future to iuduoe the removal of as many peaceably disposed Indians only to the Inuian lerritory as can be settled proper ly without disturoing the harmony of tnose already there. There is bo other location now availauie where a people who axe endeavoring to acquire a knowledge ot pastoral and agri cultural pursuits can be as weU accommodated as npon the unoccupied lauds in the Indian Territory. A Territorial Government should, however, protect the Indians from the inroads of whites ior a term of years, until they be come sufficiently advanced ia the arts and civ ilization to guard their owa. right and from the disposal of lands held by them. THE 

PUBLIC LANDS. From the same period during last fiscal year there were disposed of out ei the public lana ii,bO,tio acres, a quantity greater by 1,099.275 acres than was disposed of the Dre- vious year. Gf this amount 1,260,320 acres were sold for cash, 389.460 acres located with military warrants, 4,071,332 asn ti for homesteads, 693,613 acres located col lege crip, 3,564,887 acres granted to Uiuu ids, 4 bo, 31 7 acres granted to wagon roads, 711,265 acres given to States as swamp lands, a.740 acres located by Indian scrip. Tue cash re ceipts lrom all sources- in the L ind Office amounted to $3,218,100 during the same period About 22,016,608 seres of the Public Lands surveyed, which, added to the quanta tv before surveyed, amounts to 583,363,730 acres, leav ing lOifboo.bZo acres ol the publio lands still unsurreyed. The reports from the subordi nates of tne liand umoe contain lntereatinir in fjrmalim in regard to their le pective dis tricts. They uniformly mention the fruit lessness of the soil during the past season, ana in increasea yieta ot au Kinds cf pro duce, and evince that in those 8tatea and Territories where mining is the prineipsl easiness agricultural proaacts nave exceeded the local demand, and liberal shipments nave oeen maae to aistant PATENT OFFICE MATTERS. During the year ending September 30th. 1872, there were issued from the Patent Office 13,626 patents, 233 extensions, and 666 certifi cates and registers of trade marks. During the same time 19,687 applications for patents, including re-issues and design have been re ceived, and 100 caveat hied. The fees re ceived during the same perioal - amounted to t'),uytj,ttS and the total expenditures to 162, 355,390, making the net -receipts over the ex penditures (7,740,056. Since 1836 200,000 ap plications for patents have been tiled, and about 134,000 patents issued, the fhoe bains oonductedt under the same laws and general organuaooe as were aaoptea at tne original inauguration, when only from 100 to 600 ap plications were made per annum. The Com missioner shows that the office ha outgrown the original plan, and that a new organization has become nececessary. This subject was presented to Congress in a special communica tion in February last which bad mv SDDroval and the approval of the Secretary of the Inter ior, and the suggestions contained in said com munication were embraced m bill that was reported to the House by the Committee of Parents at the last session. The subject of th reorganization of the Patent Offio as con templated by the bill referred, is of such im portance to the industrial interest of the coun try that I commend it to the attention of Con gress. Ihe Commissioner also treats the subject of tne separation or tne jrateai uoa rxou (n Department of the Interior. Mtus subject is also emoracea in tne mil neretotore referred to. The Commissioner complains of the want of room for the model galiery, and for the work ing force and necessary nis of th omee. It is impossible to transact the business oi the office property without more room in which to arrange he files and drawings that must be consulted hourly in the transaction ot busi ness. The whole of the Patent O trice build ing will soon be needed if it is not already, for tue accommodation of the business ot the Patent Office. THE WARDS OF THE NATION. The amount paid for the neaetoa the last fiscal year was $30,169,340, an amount larger by $3,708,434 than was paid during the preced ing year, ui uiis amount J.-sv were paid under the act of Congress of Febrnary 17, 1871, to the survivors of the war of 1812. The annual increase of pensious by the treislation of Congress has moro than kept pace with th natural yearly losses from the rolis. lbs act of Congress of June 8th, 1872, has added an estimated amount ot $7a,0O9 per annum to the rolls without increasing the number of pension era. We counot thereiore look for auy sub stantial uevraase in toe expenditures in this Department for some time tu come, or so Ions H, V,,im-M PnnHnn.. U ,1 .J .l-l oi pensiou. me wnoie numoer ot soldiers enlisted m the rebellion was 2,688,523. The total num ber ot claims for invalid pensions are 176,000, being but six per cent, ot the whole uumtwr of enlisted men. The totiw number of claims on hand at the besinmnz of ihe vear w:m UI'.. OOJ. ihe number received clonus the vear 178, making a net sain of 1.264. The numiwr no iu,t;(i, xue uumoer ait-Doseu ot wss 3.).- of claims now on file is 79.085. On the :)th oi J une, 1872, there were on the rolls the names of 95,405 invalid military pensioners. 113,018 widows, orphans and dspendeut rela tives, making an aggregate of 208,902 army pensioners. At the same time there were on the rolls the names of 1.449 navv tkiiiniouers. and 1,730 widows, orphans and dependent rel atives, making the wnole number of Naval pensioners 3,179. There have been received since the passage of the act tu provide pen sions for tne survivors of the war of 1812, 36,- ool applications prior to June 30tb, 1872. Of these tliera were allowed during the nut hsc 1 year 20,126 claims, and 2, M0 were rejected du ring the year, leaving i 1,581) claims peuding at uuw aate. i.ne number of pensions of all claims fl ran ted n urine the last hseal vaar was M,83i. During that period there dropped uum me roils ior various cause y.itHl name, leaving a grand total of 232,229, pensions on the roils on tbe 30th ol June 1872. It is thought that the claims for pensions on ac count of the war of 1812 will all be disposed the first of May 1873. It is estimated that $30,480,000 will be required for the pen sion service during the next fiscal year. THE CENSUS. Ths ninth census is about com Dieted. It com pletion is a subject of congratulation, inasmuch as tbe use to be mtde of the statistics therein con tained depends very greatly on the promptitude publication The Secretary of the interior rec ommends that a census 09 taicea in is,j, wnicn recommendation should receive the ready atten tion of Congress. The interval' at present aatab lisbed between the Federal census is so long that informal ion obtained at t he decimal penrds to material conditition, wants and resources of nation is of Uttie prtctical value after tbe ex piration of tbe first half of the period.
