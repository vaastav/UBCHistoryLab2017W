ASHTAllULA: Saturday Morning, December 14, 1861. Congress shows a determination to look after the causes of failure In connection with tbe movements of our army. This Is right A military commirsion or a court marshal may be a convenient way of overhauling delinquents. or supposed delinquents and pass off as an oE rial investigation duty reported to superiors, while the whole nation is left to guess aodwon der at changes tbat seem to vitally affect the country. Thin has been true in connection with Oen, Fremont, as well as several other officers of the army. Up to thin "late the nation is left to pculuto us to tlio reasons for tho removal of Fremont. Gtn. Thomas hot-hasto sick-bed report as news paper insinuations from St. Louis contained just enough to pamper tbe prejudice and ill-will of his enemies whils i' cast a cloud over his friends.

Wten wo come at Tacts and circumstance?, it mny put a different aspect on the subject- Now these facts nre what the people want to insiire confi- ilence in our public mcu. Perhaps it wilt oe soiil, wo ought to have confideece in our rul ers our Geneials and the men v. bo represent us iu our notional offiiirs. It don't hart honest men to watch them. Aud then, bow can the people be blamed for demanding reasons and facts while our public men set us the example of superceding those whom tley have honored with their bichost confidence ! How do the people know but that such meo nre victims of Ignorance or selfislmess. " o-day balr tie na tion believe that Fremont is a persecuted, in jured niau. Tbo confidence of hundreds of thousands has been shaken, and they are now asking for the reasous tbat decided tbe question of bis removul. Wby have not tboso reasous been given to tho couotry ? Now wc ure glad Congress is disposed to look iuto such matters, and hurry rp tho investigations of our military courts. We dou't believe iu that slow-aud-cusy polity which after laying men under offi cial ban, leaves them to die onJer the cruel tor. lure of suspense-, 'i'ue linj.'er;ii of such cases, creates tho impresaiou that somebody is afraid to fuco the music Let Congress by Us com petent committee, call for persons uud paper, investigate, and Icy the results before the people, and if ull is right, it will strengthen confidence a thousand fold.

Nautical men in England express very dis couraging opinious in regard to the Great Eastern. They thiuk it doubtful whether she will ever make another sea trip, and think that after remaining a while at Mil ford Ilaven she will be converted Into bath house or a floating hospital. Tbe captain and crew have bceo paid iff, and the unlucky shareholder are called upon for more money for repairs. Uniforms oit i f Place. Tho fact that some of the Rebel rcgimeuts over the Fo tome have been recently supplied with new uniforms of bluo, like those of the soldiers from N. Y. State, and adorned with the regular N.

Of whom were they obtained by what route were tbey shipped to their destination and what was tbe object of supplyiug rebel troops with this particular, kiud of uui foim.

The Case of the Nashville. a By the arrival of the Africa at JTew York we bave full pttliculars of the steamer Nitshvilio utT-iir, which was briefly referred to by tolcgruph. Trie circumstances of the case are these : Tue rebel steamer Na!i left Charleston ou the night of the 35ib ot October, ruuing the blockade. She pro ceeded to Uui mu Ja wbcre she was allowed ull possible privileges, live cowownder aud officers being treated witli all. kiuduees and oiielitioii by the br.tisb array and navy of ficers there stutioiied, aud every facility af forded for getliug coal ana oilier supplies. Tno Nasbvillo sailed fruin Rumuda upon the Jjihot iNovemncr aud ou tue lull foil in witb ibe Aincncuti sbtp Ilurvey 13ircli, Capt.

A auot was fired Torn the Xasiiville 10 to bring ber to, and ibe order given to haul down the United States fl .g, which was done. Capt.

NeNuu uud mate were allowed the freedom of the ship, but the crew were putip irons, and in that coud tion carried to Southamp ton, aEuglud, where tbe Nashville arrived on the 21st. Tbe oaih not to beaf armi ngaiust the Confederate States wai oflcred to the men, but they would not take it. At Southampton the prisoners were set free, but were not put on shore, the being obliged to charter a lug boat to convey tbem from tbe steamer to tbe dock.' luuy waited noon tbo American consul aud Capt. Nelson afterwards went up to London to sea Minister Adams. Cant. Fegram "of the Nashville, made do defense of his conduct except upon tile principle of retaliation upon the federal Government and the Northern States- He put his steamer alongside the docks at Southampton, saying that she needed re pairs, and at tbe sailing of Iho Africa sue was sua there. The action of tlio Nashville in going Into an English port after having captured aud destroyed a valuable prize belonging lo a power friendly to England, is exciting a great deal of comment, and our miwstfr iu London is very properly waved in the mat ter. Capt. fegram uolds a cotmnusion from the rebel government, upon the etrettgtb of which be claims immunity from interfer ence in England. Upon landing, be vent up to Londou to ooosolt with tbe rube Yancey. Tbat allowing the Nashvfle to thus enter an English port, with tbo svow ed purpose of fitting out as a war vessel against tbe V. b. is a violation or iwgiisQ neutrality, even tbe bnglisn papers cinnoi conceal. Tbey attempt to justify it ly say- itiff that they most treat the two belliger ents alike, bnt it is evident they are bol-t- eringona had cause. This however may have an Important bearing upon im case of the Trent. The Nashville affair, ia one of wbicb our government haa cause of com plaint, and it is highly probable mil even if Englaud desired to make trouble of out of tbe trent affair, she will be very toady to let one offset tbe other. 1 of .

It si a pity aq icn valor ncniq hare been wasted. Washington.—Dec. 10. The Case of the Nashville. The President and the Secretary of War. The rimn Washington correspondent writes : The account given by a Jew York paper, of the difference between tbe President and Mr. Camekow in regard io amending the report of the latter, is grossly unlnst to the President. It represents Mr. Cameron as obMlnatciT remsing to sinae from his report matter that the President regarded as extraneous, ana conniving bi the publication or tne report an rriftiiianj written,, in defiance of tha wisbas and com mands, even, of tbe Tresidcnt. It is suffi cient to sy that the President would never have tolerated any ucn contumacy, h had been exhibited, and It is equally cleor that Mr. Cameron understsnds the propri eties of ofBeiol life too well to have coduct ed In sochastvle. The truth that Mr. Cameros yielded to the suggestions of the President, and hunseir amended nis report br striking out such parts as the President objected to, agreeing to spport the Presi dent's views fully and cordially. On no other eomli'ion would be, or could be, bave remained an hour in the Cabinet. Consistency. Davh, iu bis late messago ssys the blockade is totally inefficient, and proposes to invoke tbe aid of European nat ions in breaking it up. On the other hand Mr. Yancky, in his spcach to tho fishmon gers at London, soys that the Confederate States, "thougcut off by block from nil foreign trade, have been able from their internal resources alone to equiq and maintain iu the field an army of over 250,- 000 troops." The Richmond- papers mention a corres- pondeneu between Lieut. Manry and the Grand Duke Constantlne of Russia, in re lation to an offer of service made by tbe Grand Admiral of Russia to tbe runaway Director of the- Washington Observatory Perhaps tbe precise dato of such an offer i' one was really made wonld explain its opportuneness ; but at any rato, wc are sure that the correspondence between the two parties went through some secret and underground channel, as the Russian legut ion in Washington faithfully avoids an show of sympathy aud any contact w the Secessionists. Judge Trumbull has given notice of a bill or gauizing the Supreme Court, ob the basis population, and makes Ohio and Keutucky one circuit, and provide for tbo appointment of new Judges, A resolution looking to the recognition the independence of Hayti and Iberia was doptcd witb theamedment that the Committee oa Foreign Affairs enquire futo the expediency of doing so. Missouri—Sedalia, Mo. Dec. 11. It is reported that a Gght took place yester- dao near Waveply, Layfayette Co., between body of rebels under the notorious Joe Shelby and a detachment of Federal cavalry. They are fighting again this morning, but no particu lars ate given. Another "Sharp Engagement." A depatch from Fortress Monroe of the 7tb inst gives the following account of another those desperately bloodless engagements which tbat region ia getting to be somewhat famous. "The steamer S. It. Spanldinsr, arrived here this morning from Hatteras Inlet, and brihgR intelligence of a naval entraeement between V. S. (runboati Stars and Stripes.

The proof of the pudding is in tho eating. I am now in tha daily receipt of NEW GOODS, purchased in New York wilb tho cauh at tbe very lowest prices, by an experience cd buyer, and can offer extra inducements in the way of Good Goods, at Low Pricas. My stock comprises' almost everything tbat is needful fur comfort or luxury, and to enumer ate all the diQcrent styles, would, requiro more room than the printer could well spare in, the present crowded, stole of tbe advertising list. But just remember three things : Remember' That all that glisteos isnot gold, neither are all telegraphic dispatches reliable. Remember' Tbat most merchants claim to sell goods for the fun of the thing, but that I do it because I like it, and make money by it.. Rem ember That cash buys cheaper any-, where, than credit for credit is a slow coach that requires a vast deal of labor to keep in raoning order. 4)(f Don't Forget : ' To call and look before you buy elsewhere. To bring your money wilb yon. If yon don't. spend it, it will do to keep. Rut above all Dou't forget to keep your credit good by a prompt fulfillment of all promises. All kinds of Produce taken ia Exchange for goods at tlioJiighest market prices, and on ac count, at cask, prices. November 21, 1861. . t, jiorbisow.
