Coffeyville ought to be glad to see people who live in glass houses throw clones st one another, since that is vhere they make the glass. IA. college professor lias attacked the nebular hypothesis. A man must be pretty hard up for something to attack, to jump on to a thing like that. Just watch how hilarious the iailroad magnates don't get when they see how ihe people do not fail to enthuse over the Roosevelt late regulation bill: Home of the insurance officials are likely to be indicted for forgery in the ihird degree. They could be indicted for grafting- in the thirty-second degree. Probably the czar would appreciate it more than anything' else to wake up on Christmas morning- and find an as surance of internal peace in his stocking-. In speaking of Roosevelt luck, how the emperor of Japan must admire the si bit: and efficient corps of illustrious ancestors that our president keeps in stocL. So far the sultan of Tuikey has not "nindifltd" his views any more than has President lioosevelt; or if he has the modifications arc not visible to the nuked eve. Since Probate Judge Ilayden has de cided that cigars are not drugs, the Kansas City Star suspects that he may decide, one of these days, that tending bar is not pharmacy. T. T. Kelly told a reporter in Kan sas City that he is "out of politics for the present." The people of Kansas, however, will undoubtedly give him a permanent leave of absence. 'Although flowers are ao longer allow ed on the desks of the members in con gress, no rule like that will keep the Third district newspapers from throw ing bouquets at Phil Campbell. Naval battles are fought construc tively In giving the navy practice. iVVhy not introduce fist fighting con structively into the naval academy, and thus avoid the disagreeable fea tures attending the killing of a cadet? Coffeyville has decided to have a population, of 25,000 in time for the 1310 census and Coffeyville gen erally gets what it goes after. Like 3 not Coffeyville will be wanting to ennexChcrryvale and Independence as suburbs before 1910. "If Senator Burton," says the Chi cago News, "were just bright enough, to tender his resignation, Kansas prob ably would get up three hours earlier than usual in the morning to accept it." T"ut Kansas has little prospect of being compelled to do any such an early ris ing stunt. When congress actually met and Gov ernor LaFoilette saw the battle for fair railroad rates waging from afar, he couldn't keep out of it, but announced that he would take the senatorship. La Eollette would not miss a chance like that, even to be governor o Wiscon- While it is now possible to ship grain 4,000 or 6,000 miles from Kansas City to Europe for 28 'j cents a hundred, it still costs 50(2 cent;: to ship it the 600 miles from the Kansas wheat belt to the Gulf and 14'j cents to ship it the 200 miles from the wheat belt to Kansas City. The confession of Senator Piatt that lie collected annual contributions varying from ten thousand dollars down from each of the big insurance companies, leads the Pratt Republi can to believe that Burton might do better if he had another chance and "tciler opportunities. Judging from the howls about the "car famine" which you constantly hear, you would never suppose that the jailroads have placed orders for 217,000 height cars in the past year. And in addition to the freight cars they have ordered 2,300 passenger cars and 4. ICS locomotives. There is certainly no lack of business for the railroads. X'scernber second was the forty- zih anniversary of the hanging of John Brown at Harper's Ferry. Xu one in Kansas would have thought of it had not John Gilmore of the Fre- donia citizen, come forward with the information. John Gilmore remem bers more early Kansas history from personal recollections than even George Martin. THE 

RQOSEVELT BILE. While the rate regulation measure that was introduced in the lower house of congress Wednesday by Congress man Townsend is said to be the Esch Townsend bill revised, if. follows so closely the recommendations and ideas of President Roosevelt as to be in toto a Roosevelt bill. It seems to be, and undoubtedly is, purely an administra tion measure. In addition to following closely the ideas end recommendations of the president, the new bill supplies the de tails which the president did not sug gest in his message, but left to the judgment of congress to formulate for itself. The president did not specify whether the commission to which should be given the power regulating rates should be the interstate com merce commission or some other, but he insisied that it should be a purely administrative body. The new bill gives the power to the interstate com merce commission, but increases its membership to seven and makes their salaries $10,000 a year. This, it is believed, will be high enough to se cure the services of the best rate ex perts in the country, and that is what the commission needs. The length of the terms of the members of the com mission is also increased to seven years, so that there will not be a con stant change in the policy of the com mission. Another feature, perhaps one of the most important, is the provision for expediting the business of the commis sion and deciding controverted rates as speedily as possible. At present the commission is sometimes two or three years in reaching a decision, and if the railroads desire they can delay the operation of its findings two or three years longer by appealing to the courts, 110 matter how just the findings may be. The new bill provides that the com mission shall investigate rates alleged to be unjust and render a decision I within ninety days, and if they estab lish a new rate, that rate shall become , effective within thirty days thereafter. This would give a shipper relief within four months from the date of his com plaint. Provision is made for carrying a rate into the federal courts, and when this is done an "expedition court." composed of three federal judges, shall hear the appeal as soon as possible. From their decision appeals can be carried to the United States supreme court. But in the meantime tne rate as fixed by the commission shall re main in force unless it is enjoined by the court, and the courts will probably be extremely careful about enjoining. ex parte, a rate that a commission of experts has decided is just and rea sonable. Among other things the bill provides against a railroad giving some favored shipper a tip that a low emergency rate will be established at a certain time and allowing that shipper to make preparations therefore. 

JOHN SHARP W1LMA5IS' IDEA. It is with considerable indignation, feigned or otherwise, that Congress man John Sharp Williams, who marches at the head of the minority in the lower house of congress, denies that he is following President Roose velt in the matter of railroad regula tion. On the contrary he expresses the idea that President Roosevelt is follow ing him. In other words, the brilliant con gressman from the sunny south seems to think that he is heading the pro cession. Perhaps he is like the cow catcher. But the cow-catcher, you know, would never get anywhere were it not for the force and energy and power that comes behind it. If it will give him any satisfaction there will probably be no objection to consider ing John Sharp Williams the cow catcher of the rate regulation move ment. - 

1VH.VT S Tills?7 In the Republican state convention of 1003. Mr. Bone was a candidate for at torney general, but a long spell of sick ness had kept him from canvassing for the place, and a railroad combination gave it to C. C. Coleman. Tooeka Cap ita!. What! Does the Capital presume to say that its great and good friend, Mr. Coleman, whose administration as at torney geneial it has so valiantly up held: whose record as a member of the board of railroad assessors and the school fund commission it has found blameless does the Capital presume to say that Mr. Coleman was named for his job by the railroads? Astounding! CVLTII1E AT DODGE. Carry the news to Alfred Henry Lewis' Whisper it gently to Mr. Bat Mastei-son! Dodge City, once the rendezvous of the cow puncher and the "bad man," Is, by the grace of Andrew Carnegie, to attain the heights of cul ture represented by a public library costing something like ten thousand dollars. The pictures of Dodge portrayed by the exceeding graphic pen of Mr. Lewis, and the character of its inhab itants as told in the stories of the sturdy and strong Mr. Masterson, are not true of the Dodge of today. During the stone age Dodge was the ren dezvous of the plains gambler and the all-around tough. It was by no means unusual for its citizens to die with their boots on. The advocate of culture and refinement in those days in Dodge would have exposed himself to ridicule if not to a rope with a noose in the business end. But those days are far gone. Mr. Lewis and Mr. Masterson are no longer citizens of Dodge but are residents of the effete east, the one entertaining and edifying the American people with his virile pen or typewriter the oth er an officer of the law in the nation's metropolis. Dodge today is quiet and peaceable. The averag-e intelligence of its people is probably considerably above that of the average New Eng land village of its size. It knows Shakespeare and economics. The pu pils in its schools read of the cam paigns of Caesar's legions and learn the rules of rhetoric. And how it is to have a Carnegie library! Dodge is rearing a citizenship today that will doubtless be "as great a credit to it as that which it has sent forth in the past. Its future citizenship will be more conventional, and in some ways it will be less masterful than that of old. Perhaps we have lost something of value in the passing of the old Dodge. But the new Dodge, with its Carnegie library and its culture away out where the Short Grass grows, is something Kansas is truly proud of.

Santa Claus would make a big hit with most people by putting the cash in their stockings before spending it. Dowie has come out in favor of Roosevelt for a third term, but we hope this won't be laid up against the president. Although it has been two da-s since the president's message was made pub lie, the corporations have not yet got over their headache. p Very likely you did not read the president's message. Well, Roosevelt is likely to treat you that way when you get to be president, m m We have been scanning the news columns in vain for a list of the killed and injured caused by the crush at the door of the Mutual w hen the McCurdvs made a rush to get out.

There s cms to be an impression around every neighborhood that when father scolds there is nothing to scold a bout. If a. boy is active and lively his mother discovers every day that there are new ways in which a boy could be killed. The great trouble is that when a man sows his wild oats sonic innocent member o his family has to help gather the crop. When a country boy visits In a big city he notices how few barns there are nnd wonders where the fathers take their boys to whip them. It often occurs to a man whose daugh ters demand pretty dresses and tickets that the Quakers frowned on all amuse ments partly from economic reasons. Tnere is this usually to the credit of a woman who scolds a great deal: She can make the broom and the scrubbing brush move faster than any woman in the neiehborhood. One way to compliment n. woman is to ask her at the dinner table what brand of coffee she uses: The nuestion may mean that it is not good coffee, but she will not take it that way. An Atchison boy of five has the whoop ing cough and when the neighbors run over to sec bow he is. lie proceeds to whoop to show them that he is a very sick boy. His mother has discovered that when the neighbors don't come in, he does very little coughing, and some days doesn't whoop all day. but when there "is an audience h" will whoop till he is black in the face. That boy is growing un to be a man like the kind every woman knows. REFLECTIONS OP A BACHELOR. From the New York Press. There wouldn't be much satisfaction in getting mad if there were no swear words. Mourning would not be so bad if you could pick out those you had to wear it for. The only time a girl is more miserable Char, when she isn't in love is when She is. You can't take the nride out of some people even by seeing them slip down on the ice. It is easier to be rich than to be happy but nobody ever got any satisfaction out of that thought. A good way to supply your wife with pin money is to leave it In your pockets when iou undress.

Of the benefit that will accrue to Korea from a Japanese protectorate there can be no two opinions. Korea has been called the "land of the morn ing calm," but it would fully as well be designated the land of the after noon slumber. Its government has been a despotism, accentuated by oc casional massacres. The Japanese ad ministration will direct itself to de veloping the resources of the land. It will set the Koreans to work, but it will see that they are paid wages, and it will introduce modern, enlightened ideas of justice and the rights of the citizen. Existence will not be so sooth ingly stagnant to the Koreans as here tofore, but they will be safe from the caprices of a gloomy despotism for tified at Seoul. Their native misgov ernment will be succeeded by an im ported government, energetic, tireless, but humane. Boston Transcript. o MISFORTUNES.

In the World's Work for December c- B- Schillings tells, in the storv- of Gun and Camera in African Wilds," some thrilling adventures of photo graphing big game in its native haunts. Ihe following describes his encounter with a rhinoceros: In the course of a year I saw more than six hundred rhinoceroses and the tracks of thousands. The sight of these gigantic beasts standing in the moonshine on the snow-white steppes is still vivid in my memory. I have never encountered more than four at one time, though I have seen as manv as eight together. Their appearance when in a sitting posture is very like the stump of a tree. While resting, the rhinoceros often resigns himself to his feathered friends, who alight upon his body and serve the double purpose of freeing his skin from parasites and giving warning of danger. It is a case of partnership between an animal with a keen sense of smell and birds with keen eyes. The horns of the African rhinoceros sometimes attain a length of nearly five feet, and when he lifts up his voice the whole world seems to tremble. The sound is so tremendous that the effect is startling in the ex treme. Never shall I forget my first en counter the uncouth animal mass illuminated by the setting sun, its mighty horns pointing upward and its gigantic form outlined against the red of the evening sky. At a hundred paces I discharged my elephant gun and he came snorting toward me; at my second shot, when he was almost upon me, he turned in flight, and the apparent uselessness of my weapon was so crushing that all previous im pressions of the rhinoceros were cha nged. My greatest risks, however, were in connection with efforts to photograph the rhinoceros. The beast is most ac tive when the sky is cloudy, and it is difficult to get within range when the light is favorable. Besides, it is trying on the nerves (already unsteadied by malaria) to hold a camera still. How ever. 1 was successful, and it was a genuine delight to watch the negatives develop. President Jordan's Views oil Football. "I have liked many things about foot ball, but the game has been improved (save the mark) out of all semblance of sport. It is an abnormallj; special ized machine, and all spontaneity has been carefully eliminated by the gentle men who rule its destinies. Even the bleachers must be organized after the machine pattern, with yell leaders who operate the so-called cheering after the fashion of the automatic fog-signals in San Francisco harbor. As a disgruntled student once remarked to me: " 'Sometimes I feel like yelling at a game, and sometimes I don't. And when I don't feel like it, I've got to open my mouth and bark because a man waves his arms at me, or be accused of having no college spirit.' "Football has bred many fine and man ly young men, and it has developed wholesome and sturdy qualities of man hood in its day. I do not want to see it killed by its alleged friends, and I don't see how an open game will make it less dangerous to play. But there is no doubt that the game will kill itself If left alone, it is doomed unless it can be simplified and diversified. I cannot class it as a college sport today. And because of its arduous complexity, and the extraordinary demands upon the minds and bodies of the players, the professional coach holds a position of abnormal and demoralizing importance in campus life. His Influence is often bad and vicious upon the student morale because his gospel of thought and action is 'anything to win.' " From an interview published in the School and College World in The Outing Mag azine for December. Alma Mater's Honor. Fancy the following conversation between an enthusiastic college alumnus and a scholarly prep, school student: "Where are you going next year?" "To Alevard." "We'd like to come to Harnell."
