Are you satisfied with your fall If you are not, then ad business? vertise for more The Socialist ticket made a very poor showing in the late presidential election. For the same period The government cotton report given out in Washington Wednesday places the cott-m yield for this year at 6,182,970,000 pounds or 12,920,000 hales of 500 pounds each. According to figures recently made public by the census bureau, during the last twenty years, 1887-1306, there were 945,625 divorces in the United States, prior to thai time there were 328,716 severances of marriage ties. It is said that the cannibals in the Congo district Africa never allow their women to eat human flesh which, causes the New York World to remark that even in darkest Afri ca the cyrant keeps the best things in life from his wife and daughters. Prof. George B.

President Roosevelt issued a pro clamation a few days ago naming two more national forests. One was the Ocala National Forest in Marion county Florida which contains 201,* 480 acres, and the other in Billings county North Dokato. There are now nineteen states, besides Alaska, that have forest reservations under the care of the national government. A. W.

Walker Wood, former editor and ownerof the Democrat. In whatever he engages, he will have the best wishes of the newspaper fraternity of Mississippi. We Premature Politics. The announcement given out with a flourish of triumpetsa few days ago in Jackson that the Hon. Chas. Scott was again a candidate for Governor seems to have met a cold reception at the hands of the press of the state. The fact is, the public is in no frame of mind now to tolerate the opening of a state campaign, and that more that two years ahead of time. The people are applying them selves to the improvement of their social, educational and business con ditions and they shudder, almost, at the thought of warm political cam paign. Our political contests are no doubt, one of the most potent means of healthy politics and the develop ment of our country along civic and economic lines, nevertheless, the peo ple stand on the brink, as it were, and view the gathering of the ele ments for the issues of a state and county campaign, with some little 5 % t J t t t t trepidation. In a certain sense, they dread the intensity and excitement of it. They know from experience how John, Joe, Henry and Jim and every body else gets wrapped up in our state primaries. They know that there has not been an election for state an county officers for years over which friends have not separated and wounds were not made that the soothing voice of time only can rectify. It is human nature to defer the evil day as long as possible, hence it is but natural that the people would prefer to defer the turmoil incident to state politics to the last moment. And the man that truly loves his state and his people will not be the means or instru ment of feeding the flames of politics all the time. Good government in Mississippi is not dependent upon the political success of any one man. To say that Mr. Scott will get the vote he got before, all of Noel's vote and the greater part of Truly's vote does seem to show a super-abundance' of ego and to those making any such calculations, we would say keep in mind the "bare-foot orphan boy" of Coahoma county, unless they expect their figures to be very much disturb ed. A premature birth rarely ends well aud it would appear that the wet nurses of Mr. Scott's political fortunes hive blundered again. lie - Bouquets for The South. President-Elect Taft delivered a notable address to the North Caro lina society of Now York City on Tuesday night. The speech can hut make the heart of every Southerner warm towards Mr. Taft. He empha sized the idea that there should he no sectional lines in his administration and he said, i?, as President, he could do anything to bring the North and | the South more closely in touch with each other he felt that he would be entitled to the everlasting gratitude of his countrymen. ne admonished the South that her political policy was suicidal and that this section vir tually had no voice in governmental affairs. He irsisted that there was no longer any need to fear negro domi nation and that the North was willing to stand by any election laws the South passed that squared with the fifteenth amendment. Touching the institution of slavery, Mr. Taft said: It is of no purpose to point out that early in the history of the coun try the North was as responsible for hr.nging slaves here as the South, be cause we are not concerned with whose fault it was that there was such an institution as slavery. Nor are we concerned with the probability that, had the Northerners been in terested in slaves they would have viewed the institution exactly as the Southerners viewed it and would have fought to defend it because it was as sacred as the institution of private property itself. "It does net help in the slightest degree in the present day to stir up the embers of the controversy of the J past by attempting to fix blame o.j 4 4 If one part of the country or the in respect to an institution which has other gone. We believe the President-elect is perfectly sincere in his utterances and that our people will show their ap preciation of his bouquets, theless we do not believe it would be wise to step out on tee political plat form with Mr. Taft and his fellows.
