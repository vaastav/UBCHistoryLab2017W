Rumor that the successor to a former ?distilling company will pay its dividends in good, old liquor that it has in bond should ^ausc a rush of investors for its stocks at advancing prices, that will more than re imburse it for the loss of its sales. ; fable dispatches say that a British pro fessor has rediscovered the ancient secret of transmutation of metals. Now if some one ^vill perfect, a perpetual motion devico, the fcrcuter part of the earth's labor can go on atrikc and stay there without appreciable *JTcct. ; Gabrlele d'Annunzio is quoted as declar- I Jug that if he and his forces are made to give UP tbeir battle for the retention of Fiume, he tall throw up his commission, send his deco rations back to the King and become a pri vate in an Arditti regiment. This suggests tjhe question, Who would the joke be on, the King. D'Annunzio or the regiment? At a hearing recently a steel striker in the Pittsburgh district stated that his sole grievance against the company arose from the fact that it had neglected to provldo a parking place In the works for his automo bile. As Charles Dickens put it in the mouth of one of liis characters to say: "The bear ing of this observation lays in the appli cation on it." Miles Poindcxter is now recognized offi cially as a candidate for tho -Republican nomination for the presidency. His petition has been filed with the Secretary of State of South Dakota, and hiE name will be on the ballot in tho JVlarcJi primary. Evidently the Washington Senator pays no regard to the ancient proverb that "the first shall be last." but In his case its truthfulness is more than likely to be amply demonstrated. ' A peace-time standing army of ?'l0o.000 is recommended by the House Military sub committee. This is a defeat for the Secre tary of War and the general staff, which had a far more artVb'itious scheme. But the rigurcs determined"* on by the committee should be- sufficient for any emergency, par ticularly if they arc backed up with universal training. In the latter plan lies the only solu- ! Hon of constant preparedness without the drain of n huge military establishment. While we were subject to attack by several formidable powers, taxes were light, the Treasury was easy aud labor was abundant, we scoffed at every suggestion of spending a dollar on proparednesa. Now that we arc i he world's predominant force, all possible enemies are beaten and helpless, taxes are heavy, the Treasury is strained, and every ounce of labor we cau reach is needed for production, the proposition to spend scores of millions on fortifications is received with loud applause. The State can well spare a twenty-toot Fi.np from the sonth side of the Capitol Square for the purpose of widening Bank Street. It t?.onld in no wise mar the beauty of the, Capitol grounds, and it would result in an almost immeasurable improvement of ! traffic conditions on that densely congested | i horoughlare. in addition, as the postmaster points out, It would expedite the handling of the ma He. There may be some opposition to the proposal on purely sentimental grounds, but that will hardly be strong enough to block this important Improvement. The Federal Trade. Commission has lodged formal complaints charging the five big Chi cago meat packers with violation of the Clay 'ton antitrust act. With both State and Fed eral antitrust laws being so generally vio lated by all kinds of business corporations, the tenacity with which the trade commis sion follows the trail of the meat packers suggests that it is to be a tight to the death of one or the other. The. indications arc that t trade commission will be relegated to liuibo, while the meat triiet will continue to do business at. the same stand and prcity much in the same old way. Toledo furnishes an example of reckless- j ues6 io dealing with its street railway situ- | atioo. At an election held some time ago. the voters of the city authorized an ordinance i withdrawing the street car company'? operat ing franchise, following which the company removed its equipment from the State aud , suspended Us service. This left the popu lation ?without any means of transportation other than a limited bus service hastily or ganised, for which-a charge of 10 to 25 cents Vtrlp wax made. After putting up wph this service for twenty-seven days, the City Coun cil bus Just agreed to *iu arraugcmenU^Uh the company whereby Its service will bo re sumed at tho old ralo of G cents, and 2 cents for transfers. Thus, tho company wins out and tho people of tho city have their lesson in rash experimenting as the solo compen satton for the expense and inconventenco to which they have been subjected. The President's Labor Program 

THAT phase of tlio President's message to Congress which will invite the widest discussion is his declarations in behalf of labor as a body, lie was not specific in all directions in his rocommendatlons dealing with the worklngmau, but lie showed very clearly his sympathy with the demands of the wage earner for a decent living, for im- ? proved working conditions and for the right j of collective bargaining. Many powerful industrial interests in this i country continue to combat trade unionism, j They continue to light for the open shop and for what they call industrial freedom as ' applied both to the employer and the em- ' ployee. But it is obvious that theirs is a ; failing cause. In the abstract the man who i owns property lias an admitted right to hire whomsoever he may to work for hini and to make his contract direct with the individual. Likewise tho hired man may work or quit when be may choose. But when a body of labor organizes; when it sets up a respectable regime for dealing t with an employer, and when its shows a niani- j fest willingness to abide by its contracts, it j is becoming increasingly difficult for em- I plovers to ignore such organizations and to stand upon mere abstractions. The principle of collective bargaining, when accompanied by collective responsibility, must soon or late gain general recognition, however reaction ary certain interests uiay be upon the ques tion at this time. President Wilson gives labor both aid and comfort in his message in the light for the right to organize and to negotiate collectively for its own welfare and for the economic bet terment of the nation. This was not the lirst time that Mr. Wilson had taken such a position, but his frankness in repeating liis convictions at this particular time must be gratifying to all organized labor through out the nation. He has given labor leaders a degree of concern even while championing their fun- I damental contentions. He has asked the ! Congress and the country to consider the ad visability of setting up an arbitral tribunal which shall have the power to settle peace ably all industrial disputes. This seems to argue in favor of compulsory arbitration, al- ! though the President does not come out ! openly for compulsion at this time. "In the matter of international disputes," i .he says, "statesmen have sought to set up arbitration as a remedy for war." After cit- ? ing this circumstance he 'pertinently asks, I "Does not this point the way for the settle- ! ment of industrial disputes by the establish ment of a tribunal, fair aud just alike to ! all. which will settle industrial disputes j which, in I ho past, have led to war and I disaster?" This would indicate that the President's ' mind is working in the general direction of j compulsory arbitration as provided for. for : example, in the Cummins railroad bill, which j the Senate is now debating. Labor lias ar- t lajed itself with all its strength against this | , proposal, lis leaders argue that a denial of I ihe right to strike for the redress of griev ances is nothiug more or less than bondage, and it may be assumed that the intimations . of the President on the side of enforced ar- ! bit ration will arouse both alarm and re newed opposition of labor leaders. This brief paragraph in his message may even cost ? him the good will of labor, which otherwise ! would have been inspired by his advocacy of labor s basic rights. Victory for Public Right* O 

RESIDENT WILSON'S proposal to the miners as a basis for settling the coal strike has been accepted by the general com mittee of the United Mine Workers' organi zation and the striking miners will return to work at once, thus disposing of the crisis which was rapidly approaching the staue where there would have been serious inter ruption ot all American industrv, attended by grave consequences to the whole popula tion of the country. The basic features of the President s plan of a settlement, accepted by the miners in volves a 14 per cent immediate wage' in crease, to be absorbed by tho operators with out any part of the burden falling 011 con sumers, by way of increased charges for coal and the appointment, of a commission or three, which would include in its personnel rne practical miner and one active mine owner or operator, who would not only ad just the wage question as related to the in creased cost of living, but would adjust coal prices to meet the wage advance without al I V.?0 gn?al a burdcn ,0 be "Pon tbe public. This commission will undertake to make its report as to a final basis of ad justment or all the questions involved within sixty days. I bus, after a strike which lasted forty days precipitating one of the gravest crises in Ihe history of labor troubles in America the country win gradually returu to its nor ma activities and a great menace <o our national life will be lifted. Too much credit cannot be accorded the President Tor the in telligent manner In which he has brought the controversy to an end by the submission of an acceptable plan by which all of the ques tions at issue between the operators and the miners will be permanently adjusted, with ihe interests of the public fully protected in the settlement. When it is remembered that the miners had previously rejected all over tures for a settlement providing ror a waco increase below :>.l per cent, and the operators stood out firmly for a 20 per cent increase conditioned on its being absorbed by the nub lie, the victory obtained by the President in protection of the people's interest in the set tlenient shows a signal triumph in I,is method of approaching the subject and effecting a solution of the controversy. And all this has been achieved in the face of growing knowl edge that the American people had fnllv , made up their minds to endure whatever of j suffering and inconvenience to which t hev might be subjected in a determination to re fuse to surrender their right to carrv on their usual activities at the dictation of cl-iss interests seeking selfish advantages at their expense by breaking down their resistance to such attempted domination. Thus with out being subjected to the extremes of"a con test, which would have brought grave evils upon the country, the shadow of these woes has been lifted, and both tiie operators and the miners have been taught a needed les son, respecting tho limitations upon their J power to paralyze our national life. [ While it will take some time for the busi ness of t.hc country to rccovcr from the losses it has sustained by reason ot the strike, those losses nre niovo than compensated in tho out standing triumph of the supremacy of public rf&hts over slnistor movements, which had deliberately sot them at defiance by chal lenging their strength. With tho settlement now in a fair way to be mude, thanks to iho President's interposition In tho crisis, tho country may congratulate Itself ou having successfully won recognition of a principle which no class interest will again recklessly assail in tho future.

Yon think this evinces courage, fearlessness, confidence in yourself, born of the feeling that yoti can scare hi in. The desire to tear, to pound, to injure and dis figure is an animal desire. The lower the degree of intelligence the greater the desire to conquer by force or by ferocious attack. This is true of the human animal as well as the lower animals.

COLLINS. It is gratifying to learn that, the United Stales navy will soon Include, the. K-34, the world's largo^l airship. For the purchase price of 000.000 the British authorities will also train an American crew to operate, the giant dirigible, so Vttat the airship will doubtless be brought safely to America under the American fl:-.}; and by the skill of our own airmen.. High as ihe price may appear it is nevertheless trif ling in comparison with the importance of de veloping our air defenses. Mere is unquestionably, a step at last in the righl direction, and it is a matter of vital im portance to our future safety in the air that our naval program should not halt after making this hopeful advance. The appropriation for maintaining and devel oping our aerial defense is absurdly inade quate. We have failed to recognize one of, the. most vital lessons of the war. Although the pjacef treaty has not yet been signed, we seem to have forgotten our achievement* in the air and the conclusion to ithich they point. In this neglect of our opportunities we are. practically alone among the great nations. .In Kngland, I?"rance. Italy. Japan, even Germany, ambitious programs have been worked out for the development of air defenses. Our back wardness in this matter is particularly humil iating in view of the part we have played in tin* developing aircraft in the past. It is well to repeatedly recall that an Ameri can genius built and flew the first heavier than air craft. f,ther nations were quick to develop the idea. Oespitc the advantage America had won she allowed other countries to far out distance her. Just before the beginning of tho great war the air forces of the Uhited States hud been so far outclassed by Kuropean coun tries that we wore at par with, it not actually behind. China. Wc have demonstrated again what can be done by American genius and energy when once aroused. We will always have the honor of being the first to fly across the Atlantic. The Liberty motor, to mention but a single achieve ment. is'Just cause for pride. All of which proves conclusively that our de signers an<l workman are oqual to tany In the world If properly encouraged. It is more re markable; therefore, to find the American navy purchasing at a high price a single British air ship. The quostion must be asked, why, with our resonrcr.e. wc '.are not building 6ur own air craft and laying the foundation of -a great na tional industry? Obviously the answer is to bo found in the fact that the appropriations do not permit such a development. It is plain that our present air program or lack of one will in a few years bring the United Stales air forces to relatively Hilling importance, just as It wa? before the war. The imporlance of adequutc military and naval development of our air service cannot be too strongly urged. If It be neglccted wo will soon be outclassed hy other world powers. The country will soon be aroused to enthus- - iasm by the appearance of the largest airship in the world flying the Stwrs and Stripes above i our own soil. The. giant aircraft has a flving radius of upwards of 10,000 miles. In other words it will be possible for her to cross the l"i\ite?i .St ites from occan to ocean three times without replenishing her supplies. She will doubtless muke ninny extended flights, when she. will be watched hy millions of people in all parUi of the country. It is to he hoped that ^he will prove A valuable object-lesson and ?| serve to awaken the country to the necewlty of ndequate air preparedness.?Copyright, 191l>. Health Talks by Dr. Wm. Brady T?

To the Kditor of The Times-Dispatch: Sir?Certainly, we have got to look out or somebody will write our history up the wrong way. Hut so far as school histories go, we need i not bother much about them. It is a well-known ! fact that you cannot get much real history ' "aught in the schools?neither the pupils rior j the teachers will stand for it. All that is wanted in the school history is a good usable mixture of moonshine, sawdust and molasses So it must seem a little ridiculous that our war history commission modified its schctno in de ference to any supposed demand for a State school history of the Kuropean war. How could there be a State school history of this war? The men were jndifcjously so Jumbled as to much praise, very much blame, or suffer very much praise; very much blame, or suffer very much in casualties. If anybody can fix up a State school history from wjiat went on in tills war. he ought not to have the job; and if he can't fix it up,?well, maybe he is the man for it; who knows? The point is, very possibly, that our war history commission need not bother about tho school history on any ac count. it le believed that you yourself hit the rail neatly on the head. That Is to say, if our war history is to be decently written, the work must be done by a very few people, people wbo ran dig out facts and can handle facts. Are such people numerous?

MORRISON. Prince Edward County, December 2, 1919. | Keyboard Touches Hott the World War United the \ati?n. BY PRANK II. BROOKS It is.agreed that the world war was the most merciless In every respect of any conflict. Con gress debates, public Addresses and magazine articles since the 'armistice, have not eiadlcated the. bitterness created by propaganda and the actual lug. It requires a peculiar brand of philosophy to prove that what we have endured had in it anything worth commending when the struggle was at its worst. Maybe you have dis covered that there, are several sorts of philos ophy. I have found that the type commonly known a? common-sense is the one. that goes more miles than any other. It is the most sin cere. In one of my strolls in a new community, new to me. I met. an old man tottering along a high way under the weight of labor utensils?a pitchfork and a spade. He had been with "Stonewall" Jackson, lie remained true tn the I-*>st Cause until the United States entered the late war. "That war over there," he said in an honest way, "wa$? the best war thai, ever was fought. I'm mighty glad we. had a hand in it. not bccause we helped the allies so much as because It helped ourselves. My boy enlisted against my will. I told him he was going to fight with Yankees who whipped us. That he , would have to eat and sleep with them. He | went just the same. He didn't even nrgue the cuse. As the war went on I felt a change of heart coming over me. When that boy came home he told me he was going North to live. He had come to like Yankees. He went so far as to. tell me 1 waB mistaken in my notion about Yankees. And one of his Yankee chums came Souih because he said he had changed h'ts mind about the Johnny Reb. He said the way they fought over there would have won the Cause we mourn If they had been in it. He just loved the South. And he camo here to live. Now that was just what this coun- , try needed.
