paint I'jary’s Beacoq LEONARDTUWN, MD. —j, THFK-DAY Morning, lb*-. Kith, !88 The generally, irrespective of pirty, warmlv commend President Cleveland's Message. in this issue we give extracts from the President’h Message which should he read carefully as they treat upon questions of vital interest to a farm ing community. I j The Governor of Virginia has de termined to let the law take its course in the case of Thomas J. Cluverius, convicted of the murder of Fannie l.illian Madison. The last scene of the tragedy will soon be enacted on the gallows. The necessary expenses of this great, ■ grand and glorious I uion were over I sixteen million of dollars leas this y-ar than last; and the estimates for the current expenses of the coming year are $40,000,000 less than last. ! All of which goes to prove that a | Democratic Administration is not mining the country —not to any great, extent. A statistician has discovered that forty thousand tons of maniila cord are annually used in the cord tying j hnvesters of the I’niou. Manilla hemp pays a duly of $25 per ton, consequently the farmers pay a royal t-. of one million of dollars per an- . nuin on this article alone. This large amount would he saved them if ma niiia had no tariff upon it. One mil >n of dollars added to the profit of t!.i) wheat crop would be no small i iiiiig. This is but one of the number l-vs ways that agriculturists would be !•enetltted by tanlf revision. The present tariff gives the farmer the line sort of [protection that the wolf ■ives the lamb or the fox gives chick* •us. Baltimore is obtaining quite a rep utation for startling crimes. The t'urran murder is of but recent date and on the l-ith instant, thiee colored men were arrested, charged with hav ing killed, last Friday, Kmily Brown, i white woman aged about sixty years. The object of the murder wa to se cure a subject to sell to the I'niversi t v of Maryland for dissecting purposes. The Sun states that this peculiar phase of crime is known as burking, , i tc-rtu loriel from Darke, a notori ous i'nglish murderer, whose motive u killing was the money he received for the body of his victim from a med i< i school. It was was in 1821* that 1 urking first attracted public atten tion. Its rarity in this country makes the crime of Friday all the more startling. One of the arrested parties l.as confessed the crime and stated tl.at sls was to have been paid for the body. (Correspondence of the Beacon.) Washington, Dec. 13, 1886. Messrs. Editors: —lf superstition were as [prevalent to-day as it was in the dark ages, when it was generally believed that coming events could in a great measure I e foretold by changes u the moon, or the action of the ele ments, it is probable that the severe sti riu which prevailed upon the open • g dav of the present session of Con i'ss would be looked upon as an \ :1 omen, and an indication that the session would be ati unusually tur l ulent one. Notwithstanding the in clemency of the weather, however, the galleries of both the Senate and House of Representatives could not | 1. ive been more crowded had the day j sen fair and bright. There is a large class of people in Washington who seem to consider it to be their ieligious duty to go to the Capitol on the opening day of the session. and to them it makes but little difference how inclement the weather, or how ‘lull and stupid the proceeding*. Aside from the usual formalities inci pient to the opening day of the session, the usual handshakings and pleasant -r?ings ard the usual good natured * contest during the distribution of seats, the opening day of the session was marked by no incident of special in terest. The desks of several of the Senators and Members were orna merited Vith tloral tributes from ad miring friends. In the allotment of ►eats in the House Mr. Cox secured a desirable seat in the front row. He was Kept busy mo*t of the time in re reiving the congratulations of his for mer associates, and his countenance wore a look of contentment which clearly indicated that he was pleased t 1 tinJ himseit once more upon the t’.oor of the House.

The Herald has, 1 during the paal week, established an , •arly morning delivery of its papers , in Washington. The papers arrive by , special train at Ba. m , and the citi- ' zens of the National Capital are now 1 permitted to real the Hern hi before I office Lours in the morning. There is naturally some complaint among the local papers. As the result of this competition there has already 1 been a decided falling off in the num ber of Washington papers sold. Congress having began its winter session the “season ’ in Washington may be said to have been officially ' inaugurated. Plans for the social campaign are being arranged, and several “events” have already been I ;announced. Mrs. Cleveland returned from her visit to New York City on Wednes ; day last, having enjoyed her trip be yond her expectations. Although the President was somewhat indisposed, - and was compelled to deny himself to visitors on account of rheumatism during her absence from the city, she 1 was in such continual correspondence and was kept so thoroughly informed j as to Lis condition that the published i statements'gave her no trouble. The movement to advance the Dis trict interests in Congress by the or ' gauization of a representative body of citizens, who can voice the wishes of the people on local matters, still pro gresses. A meeting of prominent j I citizens was held on Wednesday even- ' mg last, at which the object* of the meeting were clearly outlined, and a committee ot one hundred was ap pointed, whose duty it shall be to represent the District in bringing the matter to the attention of Congress. The Washington and Georgetown Street Railway Company Las decided to substitute the cable system for i horse power, and a bill has betu in troduced in Congress asking permis sion to make the change. It is pro posed to adopt the system best known, and it has been demonstrated that the plan can be can led out successfully. H. Extracts From the President's Message.— The income of the gov eminent, by its increased volume and through economies in its collection, is now more than ever in excess of pub lic necessities. The application of 1 the surplus to the payment of such j portion of the public debt as is now at I our option subject to extinguishment, if continued at the rale which has lately prevailed, would retire that class of indebtedness within less than ; one year from this date. Thus a con tinuation of our present revenue sys • tem would soon result in the receipt oi au annual income much greater than necessary to meet government expenses, with no indebtedness upon which it could be applied. We should j then be confronted with a vast qnan i tity of money, the circulating medium ! of the people, hoarded in the treasury when it should be in their bands, or | v\e should he drawn into wasteful ; public extravagance with all the cor- I rupting national demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not the simple existence ef this surplus and its threatened atten dant evils which furnish the strongest argument against our present scale of federal taxation. Its worst phase is the exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of the relations between the people and their government, ami i a dangerous departure from the rules which limit the right of federal taxa tion. Good government, and especially ! the government of which every Amer ican citizen boasts, has for its objects the protection of every person within ; Us care in the greatest liberty consis tent with the good older ot society and i his perfect security in the enjoyment 1 ot his earnings, with the least possible j diminution for public needs. When more of the people’s substance is ex- I acted through the form of taxation ' than is necessary to meet the just ob , : ligations of the government and the j expense of its economical administra ! Hon, such exaction becomes ruthless ; extortion and a violation of the funda mental principles of a free government. 1 The indirect manner in w hich these exactions are made has a tendency to conceal their true character and their extent. But we have arrived at a. stage ot supertluous revenue which has aroused the people to a realisation ot the fact that the amount raised pro fessedly for the support of the govern ment :s paid bv them as absolutely, if added to the price of the things which supply their daily wants, as if it was paid at hied periods into the hand of • the tax-gatherer. Those who toil for daily wages are beginning to understand that capital, though sometimes vaunting its impor tance and clamoring for the proteo . tion and favor of the government, is < I dull and sluggish till, touched by the i | magical hand of labor, it springs into activity, furnishing an occasion for federal taxation and gaining the value which enables it to bear its harden, i And the laboring mao is thoughtfully i inquiring whether in these circum- i stances, and considering the tribute he i constantly pays into the public treas- i ury as he supplies his daily wants, he i receives his fair share of advantages. 1 There is also a suspicion abroad that i the surplus of our revenues indicates I abnormal and exceptional business i profits, which, under the system which produces such surplus, increase, with- | I out corresponding benefit to the people : i at large, the vast accumulations of a i few among our c:tixn whose fortunes ' rivaling the wealth of the most favor- ( td in anti-Democratic nations, are not \ I the nalurai g: >wlh of a >-Uady. plain and industrious republic. Our farmers too, and those engaged directly and indirectly in supplying ' the products of agriculture, see that day by day. and as often as the daily I wants of their households recur, thev are forced to pay excessive and need les* taxation, while their products struggle in foreign market# with the competition of nations, which bv al lowing a freer exchange of productions * than we p>ermit, enable their people to sell for prices which distress the American farmer. A* every patriotic citizen rejoices in the constantly increasing pride of our people in American citizenship and in the glory of our national a chievements and progress, a sentiment prevaiies that the leading strings use ful to a nation in its infancy may well be to a great extent discarded in the present stage of American ingenuity, courage and fearless self-reliance. And for the privilege of indulging this sentiment with true American en thusiasm, our citizens are quite will ing to forego an idle surplus in the public treasury. And all the people know that the average rate of federal taxation upon imports is to-day, in time of peace, but little less, while upon some artic , les of necessary consumption it is ac tually more than w.s imposed by the grievous burdens willingly borne at a | time when the government needed millions to maintain hr war the safety and integrity of the Fnion. It has been the policy of the gov ernment to collect the principal part j of its revenues by a tax upon imports, j and no change in this policy is desir able. But the present condition of affairs constrains our people to demand ' that by a revision of our revenue law# ! the receipts of the government shall be reduced to the necessary expense I of its economical administration, and i the demand should be recognized and obeyed by the people's representatives in the legislative branch of the gov ernment. 

READJUSTMENT OF THE BURDENS. In readjusting the burdens of fed -1 eral taxation a sound public policy rc | quires that such of our citizens a# have built up large and important in- I dustriesupon present conditions.should not be suddenly, and to their injury, deprived of advantage# to which they have adapted their business : but if the public good requires it they should Le content with such consideration s •hall deal fairly and cautiously with thair interests, while the just demand ; ot the people for relief from needless taxation is honestly answered A reasonable and timely submission I to such a demand should certainly be possible without disa>-trous shock to any interest, and a cheerful concession | sometime* averts abrupt and heedless action, often the outgrowth of impati ence and delayed’justice. Due regard should be also accorded in any proposed readjustment to the interests of American labor so far as they are involved. We congratulate ourselves that there is among os no j laboring class, fixed with unyielding bounds and doomed under all condi tions to the inexorable fate of daily toil. We recognize in labor a chief factor in the wealth of the republic, j and we treat those who have it in their keeping as citizens entitled to ■ ' the most careful regard and thought ful attention. This regard and attention should be awarded them, not only because labor is the capital of our workingmen, justly entitled to its share of government favor, hut for the further and not less important reason, that the laboring man sur rounded by his family in Lis humble home, as a consumer is vitally inter ested in all that cheapens the cost of i living and enables him to bring within his domestic circle additional comforts and advantages. This relation of the workingman to the revenue laws of the country, and the manner in which it palpably in tiueuces the question of wages, should ! net be forgotten in the justifiable prominence given to the proper main- 1 tenance of the supply and protection of well-paid labor. And consul erations suggest such an arrangement, of government revenues as shall re duce the expense of living, while it does not curtail the opportunity for work nor reduce the comj en.-.ttion of American labor and injuriously affect its condition and the dignified place it holds in the estimation of our people But our farmers and agriculturists —those who from the soil produce the things consumed by all —are perhaps more directly and plainly conoerne 1 than any other of our citizens in a just and caieful system of federal tax ation. Those actually engage I in and mote remotely competed with this kind of work number n arly one half of our population. None labor harder or more continuously than j they. No enactments limit then hours of toil, and no interposition of rhe government enhances to any groat ex tent the value of their products. And yet for many of the necessaries and comforts of life, which the most ecru puloua economy enables them to bring . into their hemes, and for tieir imple ments of husbandry they are obliged to pay a price largely increased by an 1 unnatural profit which, by the action of toe government, is given to the more favored manufacturer. 

REDUCTION OF THE TARIFF. I recommend that, keeping in view all these considerations, the increas ing and unnecessary surplus of nation si income annually accumulating, be released to the people, by *n amend ment to our revenue laws, which shall cheapen the price of the necessaries of life and give freer entrance to such imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished, how ever, in the direction ot this much needed reform, unless the subject i* approached m a patriotic spirit of de votion to the interests of the entire country, and with a willingness to y.s.d something tor the public good. mss.
