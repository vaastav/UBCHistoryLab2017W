A dele Ration from the labor organizations of New York city met him at quarantine. The delegation consisted of K. K Mo Sweeney. assistant commissioner of la bor; Samuel lionipers, president of the American Federation of Labor; Chris Evans, secretary of that organization, and William O'Brion of tho walking dele gates. Mr. Burns is a short man of nowerful build, with a pointed black beard, which, like his hair. Is heavily streaked with white. Though ho is but 3d years of age. he has tho appenramo of a man of bO. Mr. liurns is accompanied on his present trip by two fellow mem hers of parliament Mr. David Holmes, who represents the town of Hurnlcy. In Lancashire, and who is presu'.ent of the Weavers' association and a delegate to tho conference of the Federation of Lalx.r, and Mr. John Wil liams Bonn, member of the London coun ty council and M. P. ""It would lie unfair to the American people for 1110 to talk about them now," Mr Burns snld In an interview, - for really I know very little about them. I was pleased with tho result of your recent municipal election in New York oity. As we understood it. tbo victory was in the interests of puro municipal politics, and as my principal work at present is as a county councilor It was particularly interesting to me. I cannot talk fairly of American af lairs, for It Would take years of work for tnu to lie. nine familiar with them in a way that would bo satisfactory to mo. As for the socialist movement in Knc land, it has eonio to stay. It will grow as it adapts itself to clrcuiustancos and as long as It conforms to tho conventions which have for so long made tho upper and middle classes the ruling power. So cialism ns I; affects municipal matters is not liiixo. up with othor Issues. "I have 1 . . n watching tho labor inovu inent in America ns closely as I could from a dUtance. and I have concluded that there must bo n little more of the milk of human kindness Injected into la bor affairs If they are to progress as I would like to seo them progress.

Wasium.tun, Vec. :i. The senate was called to order today n' o'clock noon, and the last session of the lifty third congress was benun The vice president was In tho chair. Tha session of tho house was opened at tho same moment, with speaker Crisp holding tho travel. There was much publio curiogltr to seo how the defeated members who might bo present would appear when they met their fellow members who nro In a like lis and their victorious opponents. This curiosity was manifest when early this morning spectators liean to pour down Pennsylvania avenue toward the capltol. Tho house galleries were packed as soon us tho doors were opened and whon tho mom tiers ! irnn to appear on tho floor tho hum of voices broke Into such a babel of noises that the ushers had to bo sent to stop it. Tin re .

Mr Heed ftart.il tiiikly for his old eat. I ut was waylaid by a crowd of fel ow members and held iitiito n reception n tho aisle AVaitin lor thi' Mi'aj;e. .fter tho prayer and other prellmlna rios a committee was appointed by Speak er Crisp to act with tho senate committee a joint committco to not.': the prol ent that congress was in session and ready to rec.-ivo any announcement ho might wih to make. Then tho house set led down to oiiietly listen to tho reading f tho president's message. The spectators in tho senate gal'.ery ero too much awed by tho dignity of hat body to break the silence to any e- ent. There was much interest evinced In the greeting exchanged by the senators 1 he session leginswith a full calendar, he result o. committco action during ho long session, nnd It contains at least Di i items, evering a wide range of mat ers.

It is po.-lble that his purpose may bo to arrange a policy upon tho supplemen- al tariff 1)1 II. The-e bills have all been reported by the committee, but it may bo considered necessary to discuss them fur her Iwfore deciding upon a plan of ac ion Tbo Democratic majority of tho inanco committeo is on record in favor of ho passage of the bills, and it is not im probable that tho early action of the com mittee is sought to forestall any attempt to prevent consideration This is not al together surmise, for it is known that some of tho so called conservative senators havo advised that a 'reneral party conference I hi held soon after the senate convenes for ho cocsloerut'ou of this question The experience of last se.--i.lon showed thot whenever caucuses were held the conserv atives carried th.

Thero appears to bo nothing outside of financial or tariff .(UoKtlons likely to ex rlto n ripple during tho week, nnd It Is not certain that, whatover may happen ator in tho session, thero will be much in theso lines to disturb tho general serenity of tho senato during the next few days. After tho receipt of tho president's nios age and when It gets to buslnosstho sen ate may take up tho calendar In regular order, or It may proceed to consider out of order some of tho bills which have been reported, such ns those for tho admission of Arizona and Now Mexico or the bank ruptcy. antioption or Nicaragua bills. In any event the daily sessions of the week will bo short, with the probabilities strongly in favor of an adjournment from Thursday until Monday of th9 week fol lowing. Hull. 0m-ii Niisil. Tho second session of the lifty-tbird congress began In the house with the usu al noisy preliminaries Beyond tho pas- saga of the regular appropriation bills It seems probable that little in the way of legislation will bo accomplished at the short session, although several Important propositions will doubtless be pressed to tho front. Among the mombers of tha dominant party in the houso. over half of whom were di foatod for re-election, there la a great deal of bitter feeling against the administration for real or fancied grievances. It will bo the purpose of tho Democrats to curb as far as possl ble tho display of resentment, but the Hepnbllcans will spare no paint to pro voke and goail their defeated adversaries Into lotting loose thoir vials of wrath. In tbo course of tho session. It is under stood, the Nicaragua canal projoct will bo brought prominently forward. At tho opening of tho congrosa. however, rou tine matters will bo kept to the fore to stave off as far as possiblo unploasant ref erences to tbo election which would prove distasteful t i thn majority, bat thl policy can tie only partially successful, as the latitude allowed In debate on appro priation bills will throw the doors open tc remarks on any sun rot. Itefore the adjournment for tho holi days it will be necessary to pass an appro priation to tarry cut the tariff bill provl slon levying a t ix on incomes, tho col loo tion of which begins on .Ian.

There was a falling off in American wheat exports of 1:1 Sun Is M busiieiS and he secretary is inclined to believe that wtit-at may t-.ot in the lut lire lie the staple ex Mrt serial product of our country, but that corn Kill continue lo advance in Im portance as an export The report shows an increase of t.'.l head of live beef cattle exported and tagged during the year He says: "-I am entirely convinced that we onght not to be louger without u na tional board of health or national health officer, charged with no other duties than such as tN-rtain to the protection of onr country from the invasion of pestilence and disease." He speaks of the report of the commis sioners on the receut railroad strikes and says the same will be transmitted to con gress. He says their work has been well done and the snggestious they make are worthy of cor sid. ration. The tariff act passed at the last session of the cougrcss needs important amend merits if it is to be executed eff.ctiv. ly and with certainty. - In addition to such necessary amendments as will uot change rates of duty. I am still very decidt-dly in favor of putting coal and iron upon the free list. So lar as tue sngar schedule is concerned. I would be glad, undi t rxist irg aggravations, to see tvrry particle of differential duty in favor ot renoed sugar stricken out of our tariff law. If, with all the favor now accorded the xugar-retinitit; iuterest in our tariff Uws.it still languishes tJ the extent of closed retioerirs and thousands of discharged workmen, it would seem to present a hope- i l-ss case lor reasonable legislative aid i Whatever else is done or omitted I I ernestty repeat here the recommendation I have made in another portiou cf this i communication that the additional duty of one-tenth of a cent per ound, laid upon sugar imported from conn tile psyiug a bounty on its import be abrogated. It i seems to me that exceedingly important ! considerations point to the propriety of , this amendment with the advent of a new tariff policy uot only calculated to relieve the consumers of onr land in the cost of . their daily life, but to luvite a better de ' velopment of Aineri.nu thrilt and create for us closer and more profitable commer cial relations with the rest of the world, it follows as logical and imperative neces sity that we should at once remove the chief if uot the only obstacle which has so long prevented our participation lu the foreigu carrying trade of the sea. A biriff built ujsoti the theory that it is well to check imports and that a home market should bound the mdiistry aud effort of American producers, was fitly supple mented by r.-fusal to alio- American registry to vessels built abroad though owued and navigated by our people, thus exhibiting a willingness to abandon our contest for the advantage of American trans-oceanic carriage. Our new tariff policy is built upon the theory that It is well to enconrage such importations as our people need, mid that our manufacturers sin uld tii d n a ki ts in every part of the habitable globe. The millionns now paid tj foreigners for carrying American pas sengers and products across the sea should be turned into American bauds." ship building, wb.ch has been protect ed to strangulation, should be revived by the prospect of profitable employment for ships when built. Theaneient provision i of our law deuying American registry to ships bnilt abroad and owned by Ameri can appears in the light of presetit con ditions uot only to be a failure for good at every point, but to be Dearly a relict of barbarism, than any thing that exists un der this commission ot a statute of the I'uited States. I earnestly rrcouinierfi its prompt repeal." Ht lative to replenishing gold reserve re cently, he says: -Tt would have been well if in this emergency authority had existed ti issue the bonds of the government bear ing a low rate of interest and maturing within a short period. lint the congrest having failed to convey snch authority res sort was necessarily had lo the resumption act of lsT.j. and pursuant to its provisions bonds wire issued drawing int. test at the rate of 5 per cent per annum, and matur ing ten years after their issue, that bring the shortest time authorized by the act. I am glad to say, however, t nt on the sale of these bonds the premium received operated to reduce the rate of interest to be paid by the government to less than three per cent. Nothing could be worse or farther .removed from sensible finance than the relations existing between the currency the government hs issued, the gold held for its redemption, and the means which mast be resorted to for the pnrpose of replenishing snch redemption fund when impaired. Kven if the claims upon this fund were confined tn the obli gations originally intended, and if the, re demption of these obligations meant their cancellation, the fund would be very small. But these obligations when re ceived and redeemed in gold are not can celled, bnt are reissued and may do duty many times by way of drawing gold from the treasury. Thus we have an endless chain in operation constantly depleting the treasurer's gold and never near a final rent. As it this was not bad enough we have, by a statuary declaration that it is the policy ot the government to maintain the parity betweeu gold and silver, aided the force and momentum of this exhaust ing process, and added largely to the cur rency obligations claiming this peculiar gold redemption. Our small gold reserve is thus snbiect to drain from every aide. The demands that increase our danger al to increase the necessity of protecting this reserve agaiust depletion, an J it is most unsatisfactory to Know ttial tne protection afforded it only a temporary palliation. It is perfectly and palably plain that the ouly way under present conditions by which this reserve, wnen dangerously ue ideted.cau be repletrd.i through the issue andaaleof the bonds of the government for gold: and yet congress naa not only that far declined to authorize the issue of bonds best suited to such a purpose, but there seems a disposition in souie-quarters to deny both the necessity and power for the isaue of bonds at all. t cannot lor moment believe that any of onr citizens are deliberately willing that their govern. uient should default in Us pecuniary obli gations or that its financial operations should be reduced to a silver basis. At any rate I should not feel that my dnty was done if I omuiitted any effort 1 could make to avert such a calamity. At long, therefore, as no provision is made for the nnal redemption or ine patting nitn oi the currency obligation now used to re peatedly and constantly draw for the gov eminent its gold, and at long at no better authority for, bond lasnet it allowed than at present exists such authority will be used whenever and as often as it becomes necitsary to maintain a sufficient gold re serve, and in abundant time to save the credit of onr country and make good the financial declarations of onr government. Prominent among questions relative to oar banks and currency are the lack ot elasticity tn onr currency circulation and ita frequent concentration in financial tart when it it moat needed ia other porta ef tha country. At a step i that 'direction the aeert-Ury of the treasury presents in hit reoort a scheme modifying banking lawa which haa my un qualified endorsement Tne p'an is pre sentetl to plainly that any effort on my part to present arguments in its support would be kuueiduons. It is quite likely that this scheme, embodied iu the secre tary's report, may be usefully amenrld in Mine of ita details; bnt I am wtisfi-d it furnishes a basis for a very great improve ment in our recent banking and currency system. I conclude this commnnication fully appreciating what the responsibility for all legislsiion effecting the people of the 1'i.ited States rests upon tbeir repre sentative in eongresa and assuring them tbat whether io accordance with recom mendations I have made or not. I sh .11 lie iilad ta co-operate in perfecting any legis lation that tend t. the prosperity and welfare of our country. koter Clcveland, Execntive Mansion, Im ce ruber 3, 1991. Brooklyn Briefs.
