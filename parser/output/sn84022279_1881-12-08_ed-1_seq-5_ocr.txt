Ihere- ooinia worn S.UG.9U1.8G3 in excess of t.hn previous vear and $4,575,31)7.07 in excess of the estimate made two vears before tlie present period of business prosperity had fairly begun. The whole number oflettcrs mailed iu this country in the lust fiscal year exceeded one thousand million. The registry system is reported to be iu excellent condition, hav ing been remodeled during the past four veurswun goou resuii. -mo numuui u. registration fees collected during the last . liscal Year wero $712,882.20, an increase over the liscal year ending June 30th, 1831s of $3 15,443.40. The entire number of letter, and pnekages registered during tho year was 8,;W0, of which only 2,0til were lost ' or destroyed in transit. The operations ol the money order system ure niultipying yearlv under the impulse of immigration, of tlie rapid development of new States and Territories, and I he consequent demand lor an additional means of inter-communication and exchange. During the past vcar 3:t8 additional money order oflices have been established, making a total of 5,400 in operalion at the date ot this report. Kuring the year domestic mrtnpv nnlerii nifirreirated in value 10,i.07j.775.35. A . modification of the sysiein is suggested, reducing the fees for money orders not exceeding five dollars from ten cents to five cents and making the maximum limit $100 in place of $.50. Legislation for disposition of un claimed money orders in the possession i the PoetJllico Department is recom mended. ' Statistics of mail transportation show that , during the past year railroad routes have lieen increased in length over 20,010 miles, I " and ' in cost $1,1!4,382, while steam boat routes liavo been decreased in length 2,12 miles and In cost $134,04. Ti e so-called B ar routea have been decreased iu length 8,049 miles, and In cost $501,144. Nearly all of the more expensive route lie liccu uvr seded by railroad service. The cost of btar service must, therefore, rapidly decrease iu tlie Western States and Territories, in view of the fart that their total value now exceeds one million dollars. The attention of Congrem is again Invited to the subject irf establishing. system of sav ings depositories in connection with the l'ost-offiee Department. The rosmaiter-(ieneral, however, calls at tention to t he constant ly increasing cost of railwav mail service a a serious difficulty ' in the way of making the department self sustaining.

Onitoau was brought to tho court-house a little later than usual, and the' court was not opened till 11 o'clook. An immense crowd hud gathered on tho sidewalk, and when (luitoau , alighted from the van he showed unusual trepidation and begged tho officers to taka him around to the back entrance. Ho wus assured that his escort w ii uniplo for his tafety, and with trem'i :.t8 steps and cringing gait quickly st I 'hroiigh tho angry crowd. Fear was clui-iuivu on his sullow countenance and it was several minutes after ho reached his room before he regained his usaal com posure. Ev Sneuker Randtill appeared in answer to a i-'ubpcenii, but wus ut a loss to know whv, he had been summoned. Immediate1; after the opening of court Scovi .o called to tho stand Doctor James Kiunon, of Chieugo. Before any Question could-be asked witness, Guitcau csired to ii'u iress the court, and without waiting for permission or dissent on the part of the court, auid, in a quick, nervous tone: "I v..nt these expert witnesses to pass on thin point: Where a man is compelled t.i do an unlawful act.by a power which lio runiiot possibly control ' or overrule Mid by which his moral agency is dominated, is he to be consid ered sane or insane." Judge Cox" Wo will have that question discussed." Witness said he was managing editor of tho Chicago Medical Review, and lec turer on mental diseases at the Chicago Medical School. He delivered his first lecture last April. Witness replied to a hypothecated question predicated on the trustworthiness of evidence to which ho had listened, that he hud no doubt of the pris oner's insanity. Witness admitted that when a man com- mited a crime while acting under the delu sion of Divine inspiration, and then con ducts himself precisely us a criminal would do, it would oe presumptive evidence against his insan ity. Guitcau, who had been quietly but intently following witness, here broke in rather excitedly saying: "Nothing of the kind in this case." Judge Davidge "Well we will see." fSniteau (Anerilvl "You are going too last in this matter, we want. facts not your judgment. Witness "Hero understand one thing right. The Lord injects inspiration and lets tho man use his own judgment to work it, and that's just my case; that's the way I got inspiration. The Lord don't employ fools to do his work. He gets the best material. Davidge put a still stronger hypotheticol use, using the term "Like a common, vul gar criminal." Guitcau turned to Davidgo with the air of immense superiority and said: "There is noth othing vulgar about this case, and it is all ii?h.toiiod." rLauehUr.auicklv suppressed by tho court. Witness thought an insane man in carry ing out inspiration would act accord ing . to the . peculiarities of his manners and temperament,, although there were types of insanity where a man's general character became changed. Richard J. Ilentor, editor of the Washington - Gazette, had seen the prisoner at the Republican head quarters in New York and he had formed the opinion that he was exceedingly illy balanced, a cranky egotist. Witness was asked what he thought of prisoner's speech, "Garfield and Hancock," and replied that in his opinion, it wus a ridiculous, disjointed utluir. Guitcau, who had smiled complacently when the witness came upon the stand, became very much incensed and shouted out : "Well, it was not anything of the kind. You don't know what you are talking about. My speech received the endorse ment of the best men m the country." Witness resumed bv saving tho prisoner seemed to be a perfect nuisance about the rooms, but was interrupted by Guitcau, who stated, " You were a nuisance yourself. I'd rather he hanged as a man than acquitted as a fool, and I won't have any more of this kind of evidence." Witness added ho was a laughing stock so far as he could sec. Guiteau became greatly enraged and turning to Scovilla shouted: "It you put any mora or these crank fellows on the stand I'll scare you again. It was a great niece of impudence on your part to put Judge Davis on the stand without consult ing mo. . v ' " New Tork Stock Market Nkw Yobk, December 5.
