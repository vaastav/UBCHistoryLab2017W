The allies over in Europe, accord ing to the Associated Press, are going to charge Mr. Hoheuzollern with being a pirate and .demand his surrender by Holland. According to iiilornational law a pirate is entitled to the protec tion of no country. If William is not a pirate what is he? There are many people throughout the country wlio are sorry it wasn't Baker instead of McAdoo that found it impossible to liVe on $12,000 a year. Then there is Burleson, too. who could be readily spared. In fact, McAdoo is really the oiie man of the cabinet who is regarded as big enough for the job he holds. The Springfield, Mass., Republican is wondering what we are going to do for news after the war interest lags. No need to worry about that. Some years ago the attorney general of Iowa, we believe it was Remley, decided in determining a question of taxation that a newspaper office is a manufacturing plant. Well, there are still many news paper offices throughout the country and they can manufacture just as well in time of i»eace as in time of war. It was not through disrespect that some republicans in congress snickered the other day when the president was reciting his message and came to the words: "I frankly turn to you for counsel." That struck them so unex pectedly and sounded so excruciatingly funny that they couldn't keep straight faces. Some*iftf tlieni, it is reported, stuffed handkerchiefs in their mouths, but were unable lo suppress the laugh ter that burst forth in spite of tlie solemnity of the occasion. But, at that, they should have been taken to the cloak room mid spanked.

Hj.'if.'i The vote of the Iowa soldiers in uniform is more laregl.v republican than the vote of the civil population. The total soldier vote at the recent election at the various posts and can tonments was r»,!51. Gov. Hardiug received 4.101 and Claude R. Porter 1.H03. The vote for Senator Kenyon was 4,171 and for his opponent l,r»18. The republican candidate for lieuten ant governor received and the democratic candidate 1,711. Thus the men in the field put the lie direct to the partisan claim that the democratic party won the war. President Wilson frankly admits in his late message to' congress that he doesn't know what to do with the rail roads. He asks congress to solve the problem and solve it as soon as possi ble.

The president suggests three alternatives: -'^To hand the lines back under former .methods of regu lation: complete government owner ship and operation, or modified private control under unitiet management, and regulation and control." Complete ownership and operation-will be advo cated by many. However, the-financial condition of the government following the great war may le conclusive argu ment against that p&liey at this time, hence the third method suggested by the president may be the better for the present. The greatest advantage of government ownership, it appears to many, is the influence upon labor em ployed. Railroad men would not strike if the government owned the roads, thus insuring continuous and unbroken service at all times.
