The following significant patua, oc curs in the Paris correspondence of the Independence Beige, November- 12th: The late news from Mexico makes mention of Maximilian's- ill humor on account of the way in which he has been forsake by the French govern ment. It is even announced that on his return to Europe (which is expect ed soon to take place) he will publish the correspondence with our Govern ment (France), together with all the documents bearing on the Mexican question which he has in his possession. It is easy to imagine what must be the feeling of irritation that sways Maxi milian now that he is about to be dis possessed. Nevertheless, there is no discuisinz the. fact that the French, government is not free toact differently from the way it is acting iu this affair, Richmond Newspapers on the Message. O The Examiner says that there ia noth- & . . , e . , ing onensive in tne message tor me radicals to make a handle on, but that it entirely repudiates the President's test oath and foreign policy. The Whig says the message counsels no resistance to the measures of Con gress, and that it ia -virtually a recog nition of the acts of Congress. The Times savs that the messaco is temperate and firm, and that while it concedes nothing to the wild beasts of hphesus, it noes not exasperate them by unnecessary or untimely denuncia-1 tiocs. Cocksb of Prices. According to a table prepared for the New York Com- mercial Advertiser, the aggregate prices of twenty leading commodities, such as flour, corn, coffee, coa), cotton, iron, leather, molasses, salt, wool, &c, &c, re 105 per cent, above the average of IsOU. .Reducing current prices to gold, the advance is found to be within a fraction of 50 per cent, upon six years ago. The quotations are for the 23d of November, 18C6. Except upon bread stuffs, iron and bides, tho quotations are generally considerably lower than in January; and as the extraordinary prices of breadstuff's must be considers J as but temporary, it would scarcely be proper to retard the advance 111 those commodities as counterbalancing the decline in otheis. Moreover, the de cline in prices of many kinds of man ufactured goods exceeds the rat-s upon the M;i nles above quoted, it being peculiarity in the present condition trade that the excess of production runs rather upon manumciurea pro ducts than upon fixd commodities and raw materials.

In migration to Texas. An English journal gives an account of the sailing of an emigrant snm irom Litcruuui with some three hundred bcotch tiers for a somewhat novel destination Texas. This is to be followed by tw or three other vessels, and the pa?sen gers are to go at once into the interior of tue SiHie. it nas uecome rho u fireat Britain that the immense coun t nf Texas oft'ers certain peculiar vantages to emigrants in its soil climate and productions. A Rosxing Drill. In the British army, it is announced, orders hrve been issued for the practice of arunning drill. For the first two weeks of prac tice the men are not to run a greater distance than SOO yards daily; tbe two weeks it msy be increased OoO yards, and the third to 900, or than a half mile. After that yards daily are to be run, the men prac ticing on alternate days with and with out arjss and aceouterments.
