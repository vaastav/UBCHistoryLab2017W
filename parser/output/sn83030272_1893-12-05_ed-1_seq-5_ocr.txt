Nothing ahould In terrene to distract our attention or disturb our effort uttll this reform Is accomplished by wise and careful leelslation. Yhli) we should stanchly adhere to the principle that only tho necessity of revonue Justifies tho Imposition of tariff duties and other Federal taxation, nnd that they should a is be limited by strict economy, we cannot close WJr. our oyoa to the fact that conditions have fj Brown up amonc us which, in justk-o and fair ness. rail for discriminative care In thedls trlbutlon of such dutlos nnd taxation as the D merconclesot our Government actually de Si xnand. M Manifestly. If we are to aid tho people dl- M rectly throuch tariff reform, one of ita most Mr obvious features should bo a roductlon in M'i present tariff charges upon the necessaries ot f life. Tbo benefits of such a reduction would TLI be palpable and substantial, seen and felt by V thousands who would bo better fod and better W elotbed and better sheltered. Theso sifts fB" ahould be the willing benefactions of a Gov mm ernment whoso highest function la the promo tion of the welfare of the people. B Not less closely related to our people's pros I parity and well being Is the romnval of restrlc W- tlons uion thu Importation of the raw mate Bit rials necessary to our manufactures Tho 7v world should be open to our national In IW sanulty and enterprise. Thla cannot b while iij Vederat Irulslation. through the Imposition ot Wt ITbIi tariff, forbids to American manufac Wm turxrs as cheap materials as those used by their competitors. It Ib quite obvious that the ''Mm enhsneemont ot the price ol our mnnufae- tured products resulting from this policy not 'mm only conllnes tho market for theso products within our own borders to the direct dlsad vantage ot our manufacturers, hut also In mm creases their cost to our oltlzons. t, The interesta of labor are certainly, though T Indirectly, involved In this featuro of our tariff lV, system. Tho sharp competition and aottre Bn struggle among our manufacturers to supply W'M the llmltod demand for their goods, soon nil mj the narrow market to which thcyare confined. W Then follows a suspension of work in mills and Wm factories, atdlschiirgouf employees, and dig ml tress In the homes of our wurMugnien. mm ICvon If the often dUprovol nsbettlon could I be mado good that a lower rate of wages ff would result from freo raw materials and low V tariff duties, the intelligence of our working h. men leads them iulvky to discover that their S steady emplnnnont, permitted by free raw muterial. is the i:nht important factor in their MW relation to tariff legUlutlon. f A luessiiro has been prepared by the appro L; priatit t nnsresilunal committee embodilng V tariff reiorm un tho lines heroin sugseMeu whirli will be promptly subralttod forlegisla F; tivom-tum It la the result of much patriotic V and MixollUh work, and 1 lelleio It deals with M its subject conHibtontly nnd as thoroughly as M existing rondltlous permit.

The eeneral sentiment respecting the rresldenl's meiisB Is doubt less one ot disappointment, not tor what Is said so much ti tor the omission to treat In de tall many matters In which the members of the two Houses fel deoplf Interested. This par tlculnrly applied to Hawaiian affairs, and the country Is still left In doubt as to the nature of the Instructions Riven to Minister Willis. The treatment ot the financial question was also disappointing- and the reference to the Income tax In advance ot the action of tho Committee on Ways and Means was about the only surprise In the mes sage. Nevertheless the message Is generally regarded by the Democrats as being an able State document, and one calculated to secure the united support ot the party for the Proel dent, while ot course the Itepublleanstnko Isauo with him In eomeot tho most Important statements, and particularly denounced his tit terances on the tariff. Some ot the views ot prominent legislators are set out as follows! Mr. Wilson (Dem., W. Va.), Chairman ot the Ways and Means Committee, said! "loon elder Ita very fair nnd businesslike) rovlewot all the public questions on which the President Is called upon to address the people of the country. I am especially ploased at what ho says on the tariff question." "An able and appropriate message." was the comraont ot Mr. McCreary (Dem., Ky.). Chairman of tho House Foreign Affairs Com mlttae. "Ills utterances on the Hawaiian question are not as full as soma persons ex pneted. hut I have oontldonco In his Judgment and ability, and hope for a satisfactory adjust mont of the Hawaiian affairs." Mr. Ualzolldtep.. l'a.)sald: " The most astonishing thing In the message Is that nn Incomo tax has been agreed upon. That's cows. I happen to be a member of tho minority of the Ways nnd Means Committee, hut It Is the first time I know such a tax had been agrood upon, although 1 have Inquired diligently about it every dny. Mo iar as tho tariff Is enncernod. tho messago Is cot a valu able contribution to the discussion. What ho says Is not new. although ho says oomo things tlint are strange." Mr. llynum I)em.. Ind.) said! I am spe cially ploased with tho section roforrlnc to tho tariff, and tho couragoous mannor In which tho l'resldent comes to tho support of tho Ways and Means Committee. Tho reforma tion ot the tariff Is a great task, and cannot be easily accomplished wltliout tho support of tho Administration." Mr. HprlngcrlDem.. ill.) Tho message Is n ennciso nnd able exposition of tho present condition of tho country. Un tho Important subjects ot thu tariff and our relations with Hawaii, the message spoaks in no mlstak iiblo langungo. I regret tlintiv ronrodoflnlto recommendation In reforenco to our currency was not made. The absence ot nny recom mendation on this subjoct Is very disappoint ing to -hose who favor the repeal of tho 10 per cent, tnx on tho circulation of Mato banki. Tho 1'rosideut ovidently does not favor such ropeal, and tho npprohonslon which lias ex isted In many locntlons that such a policy would be favored by tho Administration may cow be dispelled. Mr. MngulrollJem., Cal.) said: I regard It as an unusually fiood .State pnpor. Tho treat mont of tho Chlneso question Is fully satlxfac tory. The treatment of tho Hawaiian ques tion I, not as full ns wo would like to have It. but tho uggoi.tlon that there will bo a special message on that quustlon with tho papers bearing uponl It. In a fev days, jiistllles Its brevity In this message. Tho treatment ot the turlff question Is full and statesmanlike, and 2 ulte satisfactory to those who believe In tho hlcago platform." Mr. Illngham (Itep.. ra.l-Coneornlng Ha waiian matters. I regard tho aspersion upon ex-Mtnlster Htevens as most se ero and almost brutal. Kx-Speaker Reed ssld; "Tho message Is exceedingly disappointing, both In matter and manner, it Is Inraely mado up ot n wearisome resume of the reports of nl Secretaries, which linve hardly been Improved by condensation. On tho Hawaiian question wo aro left as much in the dnrk as ever, anil must watt tho news ot tho novt steamer, just us wo have been waiting so long. Tho part of tho ines sago which relates to tho tariff is most surprising. It snrs that the House com mittee In chargo ot that subject has formulated plans and devlsod methods ot taxation whli li. as a member of tho commit tee. 1 havo nover oven heard proposed. It is rathor unusual to learn of the deeds of tho oommlttee. not in the commltteo room, but from tho l'resldent of tho United State. It Is bad enough to havo a tariff bill mado up by a little coterie, n' political bill.' ns Mr. Wilson calls It: tut to have It communicated to tho l'resldent beforo It reaches oven tho commit tee, still less tho House, shows a determina tion to bo movod by no fai.tH and modified by no arguments, which makes apparent tho ab surdity nf nppoltitlug Republicans on the Com mittee ot Wars and Means at all." Senator Hill decline I to discuss the utter ances ot the President, but savo no roasons for such decllnntlon. henator Murphy, tho junior Senator from New Vork. smiled when asked his views, nnd uttered tho single sen tence, "it Is an nblo document." hocator Mitchell (Hon. Or.) said that the raessago in Its foreign policy, nnd with special reference to Hawaii, was simply indufonsliile. "Its endorsement ot tho tariff." contlnuod Mr. Mitchell. "Is the endorsement of that which strikes a death blow to every industry on the Tactile coast." Hpenklng for the ropullst party. Senator Pofter said: "This message fulfils a predic tion 1 made during the recent debate on the silver question, nnd that was. there would bo no hope for the financial legislation at this Mis sion of Congress. Iteyond that slmplo state ment 1 don't know of a slnglo thing in the message that Is worth talking about." "It Is a strong, able document." x.ild .Senator Voorheesot Indiana. "Ot course I have not examined it critically and cannot speak with any particularity. 1 believe it will bo well re ceived by the country." "It is excellent all through, said Senator Mol'herson of New Jersey, "and 1 nm espe cially pleated with tho recommendations con cerning tho llnance and the tariff." "I am Inclined to think." said Senator Pal mor. slowly and with a tlngo of emphasis. " that the President's Idea concerning fraudu lent pensions Is wide ot the mart. 1 oellovo mr acquaintance with old soldiers and the pension list of the country Is as extensile as that of nuy one man. nnd I nm pre pared to say that the number of fraud ulent pensions is exceedingly small, and the clamor that had been raised against them has very llttlo foundation. I do not bsllevo that ' percent, of tho pensions. Issued are fraudulent- There may Pa some fraud amonc the coloreJ applications for pen sionsfrom the Houtli. but Ide not believe thero Is any justice in the assertions that the sol dlers from the North are drawing fraudulent pensions. So far as the President's policy con cerning Hawaii is made publlo thero is llttlo to say. Tho messneo seems to give promise of something thatlstofollovv." Mr. Pugh (Dem..

If the future suggests anything. .Mr. Cleveland says it will be taken cam of." Mr Pugh added that he was Inclined to ondorse the policy of tho Presi dent concerning Hawaii. Mr btowart iltep., Nov.). one of tho most ardent free silver men. summarized his opin ion In this ono sentence: "It Is the gold standard and bonus, with uuthurlty louged in the 1'renUlont to negotiate with tugland and mako that system H-rniauent." , . .Mr. Aldrioh 'Itep.. it, I ) declined to speak ot tho message except in so far ns it related to the tariff. T" It Is.'1 lie culd. " disappointing to those who hold different views from tho.uof the Administration and must be moro so to those who have been in sympathy with tho President's past attltudo on the subject." "it Is not what was expected and is very un satisfactory," was the general criticism of Mr Hale lltep.. Me.). "The moKsago Is made up ot details, and whatever the policy of the President may be lie has certainly not outlined it. Republicans will certalnlr take issue with the President ou tho tariff, but those, at least from the hast, will no doubt endorse his sug gest ons regarding our llnauces." . , "Tim only significant tiling about the whole business" said Mr. Chandler, 'is tint the President endorses tho Wilson rutd on pro tected industries In all its details. Ueilo not know what he has done In Hawaii. Ho sais ho w 111 not go without tho limits of ese.rutlvo power, and under those constitutional limita tions all that hecun do Is to lend the moral aid of this Government In this affair. I look upon tho attitude of the Administration in connection with Hawaii, as a disgracelul diop ter In the history ot our relatiuns with other Governments." Senator Piatt lllep. of Connecticut took ex caption to that part of the message which a. serted that Mr mount's report had demon strated, beyond all question." that the regu Iar Government hud been subverted by the in. !Sr,..rS?000' l "J'J'i but forces. He thought that this was just the-point wnlnh was most In question, and that the only scintilla ot proof to support It was the Oueeu's protest.

Vlcar-Oensral Farley. In an Interview yes terday, replied to the strictures ot Bishop Doaneon American Catholics, and denied alt responsibility for the Spelllsssr Behool bill, which Is to bo sent to the Legislature In Jan uary. This bill will ask the State for money aid to the parochial schools. It originated with tho editor of aCatholta paper, who drew It up nnd presented It to the publlo for consid eration without consulting the Bishops or clergy. "The officials of this diocese." said Mgr. Farley, "have never seen this bill, and have not been asked to sign any petition In Its favor. They decline any responsibility for It, slnoe It has boon gotton up by Irresponsible persons. Wo havo heard that a petition has been pre pared and sent to tho 000 parishes In this Htate to bo signed by the prlosts and poopto. This Is simply Irregular, and no notice should betnken ot it unless tho Bishops glvo their . a . . S II UUIIBOUU Mgr. Farley scored Bishop Doan for his statomont that the Catholic Cliuroh was on trial in this country, and refused to believe that the publlo school system would fall to pioces it Htate aid were given to church schools. Three-fourths of American Catholics were born on American soll,ahs said, and did their share In tho civil war. and they denied tho Bishop or nny othor power outstdo tho constituted courts any right to try thorn. Thoy were citizens of tho country, nnd would not Permit 01011 a Protestant cleric to tell them that tbev were aliens in tholr own land. Tho effect of this disclaimer from an author Ity of the New Vork diocese. It Is presumed, will l.o to discredit tho bpelllfsuy bill, and to havo it withdrawn from consideration. Mgr. Farley also criticised the Ilov. Mossrs. Hnrcnurt rtnd Townsend of Baltimore for re cent pulpit utterances as lacking In respect and truth in referring to Catholic affairs. Ilo warned those gentlemen that just such lan gungo ns theirs lodtotho riots, burnings, and muidors of tho Know-nolhlng period, and reeummendod that thoy preach charity and calmness rather than hatred and dlsordor, as moro becoming tholr calling. Tho National (.I'ligiio fur the Protection of Amerlci.n Institutions, of which William II. ParsoiiH Is l'resldont and .Initios M. King Is fiennrnl Searetarr. nud which has offices nt 1 Madison avenue, ha sent out a circular urg ing tho adoption by the coming Constitutional Convention nf an amendment to tho Mute Constitution prohibiting sectarian appropria tions, nnd the submission of iho amendment to t he tieoplo for a separate voto. Tho long-contlnueil stny of Dr. Burtselt In Home hns begun to dlnturbhls friends, and to arouse the curiosity of tbo public. Although he has wrltton enveral letters borne. !they havo given no hint ot his business In the Holy City. He talks of returning nt Christmas, but admits that his stay may ho Indefinitely prolonged for reasous ho does not eliooso to innko known. Two weeks aftor his departure from this city, the newspaper announced the visit to Kuropo nf Bishop Henry Oahricls of Ugdonsbtirg nnd tho ilov. .I0I111 Edwards of tlm Church of tho Immaculate Conception In Kat l-ourteenth street. They sallod In company and arrived in Homo shortly nfter Dr. Biirtsell. Thero they havo rorcnlne.l since, and now tho statement Is made, apparently with au thority, that Dr. liurteell Mas summoned to Home to explain and dofend before a commis sion of Cardinals tho cconomlo doctrines he has been maintaining for years. Ho Is not on trial, but Is acting ni 11 witness before a com mittee. This committee will one day make a roport on t he economic theories wlilh nre ad vocated hy various toaehurs and schools, and tho report will be mado a basis for a papal brief describing which of theso numerous the ories may be hold by Catholics as not conflict ing with tho received doctrine". Tho Jesuits hnvn made a strong effort to havo tho Henry (lenrje system rejected as dangerous, but the Popo refused to consider their propositions until ho had oennnd talkod with Dr. Ilurtsoll, who is considered by many to be their ablest exponent in America. This Is tho reason of tho very warm ic-eptlon given him by the Pope. Tho commltteo of Car dinals has bad several sittings, and nt each Bishop Unbrlels and Father Kdward posed as tho representatives of tho Jesuit the ories. Since Delegato Nitolll accepted as orthodox the statement of Dr. McQIynn's economic theories, which w.i drawn up by Dr. Burtsell. them has been great hesitation on tho part of the. committee to Interfere In a mattor which tho 1'opo lia permitted his dele gato to support. It Is -aid In llondnut that, should thn (nrdinnlt mnt'A ftn ndvarsn ronnrf on Ueorgelsm. lather Hurt sell mar lose his Farish and bo asked to retire Into a monastery, lis friends declare, however, that the Popo himself would interfere to prevont that mis fortune.

The trustees of Columbia College met roster day atternoon In their room In Hamilton Unit Mr. William 0. Bchormerhorn presided. The Commltteo on Rulldlngsand Grounds submitted their report In rocard to tho new buildings at lllverslde Heights. It Is pro posod that tho slto should be treatod on two levels, tho upper levol comprising the south ern portion, ahout ton acres, and the lower levol comprising the northern portion, about oleht acres In extent, building first only on tho higher plateau and presonlng the srovo ot troos and the open space at the northerly end. It would seom probable that the northerly part could be kept open and avallablo for sports for a numbtr of years. The general schema under consideration places tho entrance in tho centra ot tho block on ll'itli street, between tho lloutovnrd and Amsterdam nvenuo, opening Into a lnrgo quadrangle. It Is proposed that the northerly sldo ot the quadrangle and the principal archi tectural feature ot tho slto shall consist of a large building. Including the library, chapel, and dining hall, together with tho offices ot administration and an academlo thoatro capa ble of seating 'J.l)00 or '-'.COO peoplo: tho othor sides ot tho nuadranglo to he made up of buildings devoted to tbe arlous departments. The buildings will not exceed four stories and a basement in height. It was decided to employ McKIm, Mead A Whlte as architects to prorare a general plan and detailed designs for tho buildings II rut to I hn Arafltsri. Thn hulldlnirs which will nt nnnii I be noedotlaro the library and two pall lions. As it Is ossenttnl that thoso buildings should bo completed before the college can be re moved to the new site, work upon tno plans will bo proceoded with at once, although the money tor the buildings hns not vet been pro vided. Nona of tho collogo funds ars mail able, nstlier cannot bo usod without curtail tug educational work, and the college must look to the generosity of Its alumni and friends. Tho committee stated that they had been In formed that tho (iovernors of the Now York Hospital might he able to give possession nt tho llloomlngilnlo Asylum on July 1. lyiM. hlx months prior to tho day fixed by tha contract : nnd that to enable the college to take posses sion on the earllor date It would be necccssary to proceed at once to prepare plans for tho re modelling of the presont buildings. The com mltteo received authority to employ profes sional assistance. They wero also autliorl7od to leave sueh portions ot tho prosent build ings as thoy should deem proper in a condition to be used as dormitnrios by tho olllcers nf instruction, the follows, nnd the older students. The commltteo called atten tion to thn strong feeling ot hope on the part of many ot the nlumnl thnt tho college would adopt the dormitory system, and rooommend ed that the experiment should be tried In tho form suggosted as a means ot testing the de mand for such accommodations. The Hoard of Trustees aro distinctly In fa vor of tho dormitory system. It was resolved that a chair be established on the School of Political Science, to be known as tho Hamilton Pish ( hair ot International Law and Hlplomacy. This Is a memorial to the late Hamilton Fish, who was for forty years a member of tho Hoard. 

WILL HATE TO CLOSE OK CUT ITAOES. Effect or tha Wilson Tariff Hill on the tVll. llamaburKls Husar lteflnrles. Mr. A. J. Mollenlmuer. the Wllllamsburgh sugar refiner, said of the Wilson Tariff bill yesterday: "America will bocome tho dumping ground for the sugar refineries of all tho other coun tries It tho Wilson bill becomes a law. We cannot compete with foreigners unless wo roduco our prices, and to reduce the price of sugar we would have to cut wages. We aro paying unskilled labor at present from $l.f0 to $1.80 a day. while In Germany the prevail ing rate Is f0 cents a day. To enable us to keep running wo would havo to mnko an ex tensive cut. nnd pay unskilled laborers ns little as (SO or 75 cents a day. If we could not get men at that figure wo would bale to close up our refinery, and tha probability is that vu would do so anyhow. "home people have an Idoa that tha sugar business Is In the hands nf a gigantic trust. th American Huar lletlnincConip.iny. This was true at ono time, but ut pre-o-nt nearly one-third of I ho businesH Is dune by houses outside tho trust, and tills eonuwiltlon km-ps prices down ns low as possible uhen allow ance l mado for tho payment of fair salaries and a fair protlt. li "Although our refinery Is much smnlleM than thoso of tho trust, wo pay $43.1)00 u month freightage, which deoi uit Include tho orders of wholesale grocers, and our cartage bill runs up to ffn.000. liosldes that, we no 100 tons of coal a day: so you so that tint closing down of our rHllnerv would n fleet a good many people outside of ouremploycoo."
