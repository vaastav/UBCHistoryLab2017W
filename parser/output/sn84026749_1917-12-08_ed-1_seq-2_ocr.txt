E&Z&V&ty THE WASHINGTON TIDIES. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8. 1917. - Refugee's Story Clears Up Cause of Halifax Disaster and Great Loss " kw''7 SAYS BELGIAN SHIP. AFIRE RAMMEDBOAT BEINGT.N.T. (Continued from First Page.) thought It was a German ship shelling the town. Somehow I dldnt. Sly nrit -thought was that the citadel had blown up. "I don't make any bonee about say ing that I beat It. I ran out Into tne .street. It was filled with people cry "lng, praying, but all running. Some body said: Run south, because the explosion was to the north of us. "Believe me I ran south, but I was Hot alone. The windows were broken out and the street filled with debris. Windows of Jewelry stores were broken out and diamonds and watches lay open in Vie cases, but nobody paid any attention to them. I guess ev erybody thought the same thing I did, to get to an open place as soon as possible. Heard Cries et Weunded. "It was fearful. Lire wires were down all over the street and In the buildings that were shattered we could hear the wounded crying. "Trying to help at that time was worse than useless. It was too big. It was stunning. We didn't co-ordinate, all we thought of was to get somewhere away from the horror, "I turned into a parade ground some blocks from my office to get ny breath a little and then ran up on top of the hill. This cnust have been ten minutes after the explosion, but a big mushroom of smoke which was bursting pure white at the top towered up into the sky over the harbor. It was terrifying, but still one of the most magnificent things X ever remember seeing. "From the top of the hill I soon faw that practically all the destruc )tlon was on the north of us. In the poorer wooden section of the city. Weodea Uetues Wrecked. "The force of the explosion had Demolished the flimsy wooden build ings and the overturned stoves had aet them on fire. I did not hear at any time the slightest suspicion of a German plot. An officer In the citadel told me that the Mont Blanc bed 610 tons of T. N. T. on boardbut that only forty Jons of It exploded. I do not know how he knew. I think he was probably mistaken. At the time We stood on the hill orders had come to be ready to flood the naval maga clnes In the harbor. "Stranttlv enonrti then was tin scram ble to leave HallfaT that night. A train was scheduled to leave at 6 p. m., and finally got away at 1130. and I came en her, having intended to leave on that dar. "I 'would give it as my opinion that Hsllfsx Is not In such great need of food as people Imagine. What she does used Is doctors and nurses, medicines and carpenters. There are large stores Bf food, blankets, and all those things .t Halifax. It is the principal military city of the Dominion, and besides there sure large wholesale houses there and sU St. John and Truro near by. Seeds Hectors aad Glass. "But she needs medical attendance fend window glass. I don't suppose there is a whole window in the ctly nor a whole dish. "With the blizzard which has start ed in since I came away the people must be suffering terribly with cold and exposure, besides from their hurts and burns." Asked how many dead he thought there were in the city, Mr. Arbuckle said he believed there were at least (,000, and possibly as many Injured. STOVES TO HALIFAX Twenty-five thousand blsnketa and 600 stoves from the Portsmouth, X IL. navy yard were today ordered snt by Secretary of the Navy Dan iels to relieve the suffering of bllz-rard-swept Halifax. He also dispatched a hospital unit from Provlncetown. Mm, and In formed the Ited Cross that every thing the navy has available for re lief work Is at the disposal of Hall Sax. Meantime three American vessels. arrived since the explosion, are do ing a work of mercy for the city. One ship adapted to hospital purposes has been converted into a great "sick oay." where American naval surgeons and Halifax doctors are attending hundreds of Injured. American sailers ashore are polic ing the city, and building shacks to shelter the freezing people. An overnight messsge from the American naval commander in charge described the situation in Halifax as "acute and confused."

S-, Dec 1 A lashing northeaster burdened with sleet., that howled in from the Atlantic all last night, and was still raging early today, faTed to bait relief work in this stricken city. Twenty thousand destitute men. wo men, and children were sheltered In buildings and homes which still remain standing. Barriers of tar paper were built in the shattered windows to shut out the bitter gale. The loss In Halifax falls heaviest upon children. Whole schools. Oiled with pupils, were demolished, leaving but one or two survivors. Hundreds of children have been blinded, many permanently. by flying glass. Two thousand dead. 5.000 injured. 20.000 homeless was the toll In Halifax and Its suburbs when the French muni tions ship Mont Blanc blew up In the harbor Thursday, according to citizens committee estimates today. The dam age IS 300,000,000. Eitnr Net Biassed. Authorities, while too busy In car- I lng for the more fortunate victims to discuss other questions, refuse to be lieve that an enemy hand had aught to do with the collision and fire. The thorough checking up work of the citizens' committee resulted in every destltue person in Halifax be ing taken care of last night, when it was certain death to wander through the storm-swept streets without proper clothing. Many of the refugees are going about wrapped In blankets. Their own clothes are torn to shreds. BUsxard Brings Menace. The wildest weather the Atlantic coast can produce has practically end ed the hunt for bodies. A thick pall of snow covers the blackened ruins of the north end. The sleet helped the exhausted firemen once again to sub due the flres In the wreckage. The many thousand homeless vic tims of the horrible disaster face added terrors today, pneumonia and famine. The blizzard, abating somewhat to day, is directly responsible for the deaths of many who were alive but who had rot been rescued from the mass of wreckage. The blizzard may prove a double menace. Adding to the suffering to the probable extent of pneumonia. It may also seriously Interfere with railroad traffic. In that event, the relief trains would be held .back, and hunger would necessarily follow. 1.700 Bedles necevered. Official statements Issued today by heads of the relief committee show that 1.700 bodies have been remoted from the mass of debris. When those who found places to sleep or shudder throughout the long, cold night, emerged today, the scene which greeted them was even more appalling! Many bodies which had been spared by the flames had been frozen. The blizzard had completed the work which the fire had left unfin ished. It had done more. It had penetrated every house left stand ing in Halifax, had added exposure and cold to shock and injuries, and had paved the way for countless cases of pneumonia. Xo Wladew Panes Left. The fight against the elements was more uneven than the fight against the fire There Is not a window pane left In Halifax, Dartmouth, or Rich mond. Many doors were twisted from their hinges and many houses were so twisted that the doors do not fit. Improvised shutters, pillows, old clothes and boards failed to keep out the biting gale. Added to this suffer ing was the fact that the victims, for the greater part, were compelled to remain in darkness throughout the night. Those who possessed lamps or lan terns could not keep them lit. so strong was the gale which harrassed the stricken city throughout the long night. Kven rescue parties are compelled to cease work occasionally and seek places of warmth. One Itellef Train Arrives. But one of the many relief trains said to be headed for Halifax has ar rived. That is the first train leaving Boston. Tor the first time since Halifax tottered and fall Ilka a house of blocks, the devastated area may now be defined. The destruction extends from North street, near the center of the city, for a distance of more than twd miles up the harbor to Xfrlcville on the Bedford Basin.

"Foods of the perishable prod ucts group." says the Food Ad ministration, "are essential to nu trition, and their continued pro duction, distribution and consump tion are vital In view of national and international necessities. The Food Administration desires to emphasize these facts and to as sure all producers snd handlers of milk and dairy products, poul try and tgf, fish, fruits, potatoes and vegetables that no restric tions have been placed on such food materials or are liable to be." tance of nearly a mile along the water front to Oottingen street. ,. f .I... .t. ,li, tmnt wtmrn the homes of the poorer clssses were (located and where the scene of de- structlon are the worst. In the section of Dartmouth tnere is not a single borne but what was damaged. This condition also pre vails In Richmond where the mortality list Is even more appalling. Cidk Still la Dark. Until the work of rescue nears completion two other Important fea tures will remain unheeded thai of compiling the mortality list and that of fixing the blame for the explosion. A mistake In signals is the gener ally accepted canse. The Inquest upon the dead and the inquiry among the living are being held today by a special tribunal ap pointed from Ottawa. It consists of itirfc on tnftresntlle eXDert. and one naval expert. The tribunal lsj headed by Justice Drysdale, the only admiralty Judge In Nova Scotiav Relief workers arriving today from surrounding cities scarcely could be lieve their eyes at the scene of de struction, desolation, and devastation. They had expected much, but the sight which greeted them almost de fled description. Fbyslelans Overworked. Much of the work naturally falls on the hundreds of phslclans and nurses of this and aurroun..ng cities on whom the demands are exception ally heavy. In many Instances one physician has as many as twenty-five cases, and the demand being so great he cannot expect assistance from other physicians. From out of the chaos there comes at least one bit of cheering news. A careful search has failed to rind injury to any of the many vessels laden with the men who are bound for "over there." The American sailors, at first re ported to have been injured or killed, are guarding with fixed bayonets what Is left of homes and business houses It will be many days before a complete" list of the fatalities esn be compilsd days before the debris csn be cleared. Today Halifax Is a place of hoapl tails, and morgues, of bitter cold, driving sleet, and blackened wreck age. Many Inquiries. Telegrams are pouring In from all parts of America asking for In formation concerning persons who may have been In the city when the French ship blew up. Every train brines crowds of relatives racked with suspense for seme loved ones. I ine noieis are mrunKcu wuu bbq faced Everywhere Is desolation, ev erywhere mourning. The exact extent of the toll In hu man lives cannot be known for many days, probably never will be known. The fire which swept the blasted area wiped out the wrecks of hun dreds of buildings. The storm has greatly delayed trains and prevented relief parties from outside cities from getting to work as early as they expected.

There is no function in the social life of Americans more potential of good or evil than that of the editor of a great newspaper or magazine. Its jnfluence extends throughout the land and its consequences are felt even by generations yet unborn. "Mr. President, in wading through the enormous mass of common place editorial stuff which fills the metropolitan newspapers nowadays one becomes tired with the pernicious monotony. Most of these editors write what they are told to write and support the policies agreed upon by the patriots for pelf. To run upon something really virile, vigor ous, healthy in morals and sound in economics, such as the editorial which appeared on the first page of The Washington Times of the afternoon of yesterday, is refreshing. I am going to ask permission to insert this editorial in the Record. It is worthy of a p'aee there. I wish every patriotic American could read it. Its patriotism is refresh ing, and the salutary lesson which it teaches ought to bear good fruit. I especially commend it to the Committee on Interstate Commerce, to which I shall ask that it be referred. I ask that it be inserted in the Record, without reading, unless some Senator desires to have it read." There being no objection, the editorial from The Washington Times of December 6 referred to was referred to the Committee on Interstate Commerce and ordered to be printed in the Record. 

EUROPEAN WAR NEWS SUMMARY The battle on the Asiago plateau positions, west of the Brenta river, in northern Italy, panses momentarily as the forces of General Diaz have withdrawn to the second defense line of heights in this area. The Austro-Germsns, again seeking to pierce and then turn the Italian line with hose forces, have apparently once more failed in their chief object. The Italian second line is reported to be held intact and is de clared to be stronger than the first The Teutonic troops directed their chief attacks against the Ital ian defenses on Slonte Sisamol and Monte Meletta. south of Gallio. But it was in the latter sector that the piercing movement was at tempted.. Terrific artillery bombardment preceded this operation, but the bravery of a single brigade of Bersaglieri, the Fourth, saved the day. They held out for twelve hours and made it possible for the Ital ians to link up their second line at all points in this vicinity. The Austro-Germans made six desperate attacks and were finally compelled to desist because of very heaty losses. to ue expeciea, no ever, that the Invaders will renew their offensive. On the western front there are Indications that the Germans con template an attack In the Arras region, north of tho River Scarpe, south of Lens. The latest British official report at hand mentions in creased artillery activity of great intensity In this region, which Is north of the Cambral area. It Is not Improbable that the Germans will attempt to push forward along the Scarpe In order to weaken the hold of the British to the southward, at Hullecourt, above Queant- In the Cambral sector relatively little fighting of more than local Importance has occurred In the past thirty-six hours, and most of this has been initiated by the British. They attacked on the eascrn side of the salient, and in tho Wdnlty of La Vacquerle. German trench posl tlons were captured and the British line materially improved thereby. On the French front the artllery activity remarked for the past four days contnues In tho Champagne and on the Verdun front; in the former sector near Malsons de Champagne, and In the latter, east of tho Meuse. No infantry actions have occurred. The French official report states that the iirtillery aclhlty has also Increased greatly in the region of the Khine-Rhone canal. It will be recalled that this Is tho section of the French line where United States troops have been In front line trenches for training purposes, and it is not Improbable that the Germans intend one of their "object lessons" In an attack In some force. It is now announced officially that tfce Roumanian forces have un dertaken armistice negotiations with the Austro-derman command, following such action by the Russian commarder on the Roumanian front. Since the upheaval that floated the Maximalists to the top in Russia, Roumanian armed forces h" bee" isolated and there was practically nothing else for them to do than to fo low Russia's lead. In the Palestine campaign, which ig beInJS !f".dlVont'nu"l by General Allenby's British forces, it is announced that Hebron has been captured from the Turls. This is V"t of the ueneral encircling move ment being directed against Jerusalem, Hebron being twenty miles to Dnrinff yesterday's session of the Senate Senator Vardaman, ris ing; to the question of trade legis lation, made extended reference to the editorial columns of The Wash ington Times, as follows: "Mr. President, I ail not going to detain the Senate by a discus sion of this bill this afternoon. It is a subject that should be given very careful and exhaustive con sideration before it is disposed of. .The Congress should be careful in dealing with such matters lest greater harm might be done than possible good effected. A great deal of new legislation will proba bly be proposed at this session of Congress; I am always glad to re ceive suggestions a new thought or an idea is of immense value in these abnormal times. But, I re peat, we should be careful, and no legislation of a permament charac ter should no enacted that could

But the very speculation Indulged by officials illustrates how compu cated and uncertain Is the whole Rue slan situation. In the face of such circumstances the formulation of a policy is hazardous. Tet President Wilson apparently has determined to follow the same course that he aid In Mexico to omit no opportunity to express the sympathy of the United States with the revolution as sn ab stract thing, and to refrain from showing excessive friendliness to or partisanship for any faction until as sured that the latter is truly repre sentative of the revolution and pos sesses the elements of sovereignty popular support and sanction. Great Britain and France have not been ready to go as for as the United States. v "t n'llson's posl- on In the councils of the allies Is such tit., i point of view eventually will be accepted. Press dispatches from Paris har repeatedly hinted that Colonel House was endeavoring to get the entente to adopt a more sympathetic attitude toward the Russian revolution, how ever disappointing may be Its present military aspect. The President's message to Congress reveals his pur pose not to relax the moral support of this country to the revolution as a whole, though material aid may be for the time being withheld until a government of unquestionably repre sentatlve of the people Is established. Senator Sterling of South Dakota, who has long taken a keen interest In the affairs of the District, today declared for the Polndexter delegate bill. "I am in favor of the Polndexter bill which would give the District a delegate In Congress," said the Sen ator. "I bellev the District should be rep resented by a delegate chosen by the people who would have the right to speak on District affairs and vote on them." Senator Sterling said he was not yet ready to support the proposition of complete self-government for the District but he was clearly In favor of a delegate and would so vote and speak In the Senate. A bill In equity will be filed before Judge Beat In the circuit eourt at Marlboro Monday morning for the re turn of about 120,000 north of prop erty belonging to the rtie saloonkeep ers of Bladensburg, which is held In the custody of Deputy Sheriff Thomas V.
