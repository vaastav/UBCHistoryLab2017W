Free-trade and Democratic papers Jiko tho Brooklyn Eagle, which' sup ported Mills, are now nuotincr Mr. CrisD W 9 - A to show that he is as much a free-trader as Mills; but all this does not pacify the mugwump, who gees his idol. Cleveland, broken in as many pieces as was Humpty-Dumpty in his sad fall. Democratic organs that supported Hills are trying to make believe that they really preferred Crisp all along, but Mills himself refuses to bo placated. Tho gentleman from Texas lacks some of the qualities that go to mako up a typical Democrat he seems actually to bclievo in tho principles he professes. poor things, in view of tho fact that Mr. Cleveland is not likely to bo a presi dential candidate, that they put him. or one of their own number in nomina tion for President, and so stand up and "bo counted. By so doing tho census of tho political perfectionists could bo akcn. The New York Herald's Washington correspondent is responsiblo for the re port that .Mr. Stahluecker. who repre sents a district in tho suburbs of that city, after having ' voted for Mills twenty-nine , times, was forced to vote icr Ln9p Dy tho threat ot lammany's Police Commissioner ("Martin,, who told him that if ho did not vote for Crisp his dozen appointees on tho New York po lice forco would be dismissed. Mr. Miller, of Wisconsin, one of tho Democratic surprises of 1S90, has taken occasion to display tho quality of his statesmanship by presenting" resolu tion to apportion the committees among the States according to their population and to appoint at least one chairman from each State. Ir Miller appears to fear that he and other novices and acci dents may bo forgotten, but his resolu tion will never again be heard of. The New York Evening Post, which is trying to bo cheerful in adversity, pro fesses to believe that Mr. Crisp, con trary to tho general impression, does not represent radical and dangerous opin ions on tho silver question. As proof of this position, it argues that if ho were really a free-silver man, Bland, of Mis souri, the fruo-coinago leador, would have voted for him, whereas, on the contrary, Bland supported Mills in the speakership contest. If this argument is worth anything, it proves too much for the Post's purpose namely, that Bland had confidence that Mills would tot antagonize the free-silverites. Tho fact is that Bland voted for Mills be cause both were from tho Southwest, end ho had to. No part of tho President's message more thoroughly fchows his interest in the welfaro of tho people than that par agraph in which ho reiterates the neces sity of compelling railway companies doing an interstate business to equip their cars with, self-couplers. Tho fact that CC9 brakemen were killed and 7,841 injured during the year which ended Juiio CO, 1600, seems to tho President an urgent reason why Congress should nt- Jterid -to1 this matter.' He maintains that ,tbj Koveriuucut, which expands more than a million dollars a year for a life savicg service for sailors and people who may bo shipwrecked, cannot con sistently permit the lives of the army of men engaged in car-coupling to bo im periled by dangerous appliances. The death of Rev. Oscar C. McCulloch ia a loss to tho community whoso full extent, serious as it is seen to be, can hardly bo fully realized until time shows how great a gap is left in the places ho has so long filled, lie has been a useful citizen, an earnest and faithful pastor, and'an energetic and untiring worker in every field of charity. His exec utive ability was remarkable, and this, added to m ' his,, zeal, resulted in bringing together many forces for good that had hitherto lacked the effectiveness of . organization and definite purpose. TheOrganized Charity Association was brought into its present state of usefulness largely by his per sonal efforts. Wherever good could bo done in a practical way there his atten tion was turned, bo it in the direction of evening schools " and reading-rooms for busy young men and women, or the im provement of the poor-houses and prisons of tho State. His efforts were not confined to public enterprises, however. Ho was tho friend of all who came to him in sorrow and nflliction as people will come to a man known to be sympathetic and help ful, forgetting, perhaps, that their de mands drew upon hts strength. He has labored hard and unselfishly in this city, and all his efforts have been for good. Out of this unselfishness nnd ceaseless work conies, undoubtedly, his untimely death. Too early he rests from his labors, but surely his works shall follow him. LET TJ3 POT AN END TO 

GEESY1TANDEB3. Thcro could be no better evidence of tho unanswerablencss of the President's arguments against gerrymanders as af fecting the election of national oflicers than the fact that the Indianapolis Sen tinel admits their force and the pro priety of the President's suggestion that a stop should be put to tho whole busi ness. The Sentinel Rays: The message concludes with aRtrong at tack on th 'gerrymander," with especial reference to tho Mictiican scheme of elect ing presidential electors from congressional districts. We havo not much confidence in Kepublican sincerity on this subject, for the reason that every Kenublican State in the Umou is most villainously gerryman dered, and one or two Democratic States aro in Kepublican hands for the same rea son. Coming, as this plea does, jast after an attempt to control the elections m the South by national oflicers. and after the political complexion of the country has almost been changed by the admission of rotten borough States, the indications of hypocrisy are peculiarly strong. Never theless, we advise the Democrats in Con gress to take the President at his word and adopt an amendment that will prevent ger rymandering for national purposes. It is a game that two can play at. and the Kepub licaua may be in position before many years to inako much more of it than the Democrats possibly could. If they should gain control of New York, for instance, an application of the Michigan theory would effectually end all hopes of Democratic su premacy. The message advances this one idea which is worthy of adoption. Wo rass by tho expression of doubt as to "Kepublican sincerity" and the charge as to Kepublican gerrymanders. These comments are not to the point, except that if there aro as many Krrmblican gerrymanders as the Sentinel asserts it furnishes a strong argument for putting a stop to tho business. The main point is that a Democratic paper which has always defended its party's gerryman ders in this Stato practically admits that tho President's presentation of tho caso is unanswerable, nnd advises the Democrats in Congress to adopt an amendment to the Constitution'that will prevent gerrymandering for national purposes, viz., for tho election of Hepre- scntatives in Congress and presidential electors. In the interest of good government, fair play and honest elections, the Jour nal heartily indorses the suggestion of the Sentinel and urges the Republicans in Congress to co-operate with the Dem ocrats in giving forco and effect to the President's suggestion. Let us admit, for the sake of argument, that tho Re publicans have dono wrong in this re gard as well as Democrats, and that one party is as deep in the mud as tho other is in the mire. So much tho more rea son why neither party should waste time in accusing the other, and why both should uuito in carrying opt the wise and patriotic suggestion of tho President. 'Admitting that both parties are equally at fault in 'the matter, is it not time that tho patriotic senso of justice in the American poople should assert itself by calling a halt in crimi nation and recrimination, nnd insisting on the adoption' of a remedy!' As the President says: That there is a real danger here all must agree, lint tho energies of those who see it have been chieh'y expended in trying to fix responsibility upon tho opposite party rather than in etlorts to make such prac tices impossible by either party. Isitnot possible now to adjourn that interminable and inconclusive debate while wo tako, by consent, one step in the direction ot re form by elimiUHting the gerrymander, which has been denounced by all parties, ns an influence in the election of electors of President and members of Congress! It would be a great relief for the coun try to see both parties in Congress sus pend tho work of President-making and partisan legislation long enough to unite in adopting and submitting to tho people a constitutional amendment which should at once and forever put an end to gerry manders in national elections. That such an amendment would bo adopted by the various States there is not the shadow of a doubt, and that done tho end of legislative gcriymanders in the States would soon follow. Tho Journal wouid like to see the movement started in Congress by some member from Indiana. As it is a mat ter in which both parties and all the peoplo aro interested there should be no attempt to make political capital out of it, and whether tho measure is intro duced by a Kepublican or a Democrat it should receive unanimous support. THE 

NATION'S UEBCHANT JIAEIKE. To-day tho United States has Iho largest domestic mercantile marine in the world. While our ocean marine has largely disappeared, the domestic has grown with the growth of the country. It is a marine made up of American built aud American-navigated vessels. On the great lakes alone this domestic shipping was valued, last year, at '58, 123,500, while the tons of merchandiso it carried one milo was more than one fifth the mile tonnage of all the rail roads in the country. To this must be added tho coasting and river tonnage, the total of all domestic tonnage being S.UOC.OCO tons to 088,700 engaged in for eign trade. In 1800 our foreign-going tonnage was 2,042,000 tons. Wo lost one-half during the war, and the lead which Great Britain had in iron ship building carried us down still further. Now, under tho mail subsidy provisions of the last Congress, wo are ngaiu grow ing. Why havo wo held our own and gained year by year in regard to our domestic merchant marine! Because some branch of Congress has been ablo to withstand tho demand for. free trade in ships and has stood by tho law mado whilo Wash ington was President, by which an American citizen could not purchase a foreign-built ship to sail under tho American Hag, and has reserved to American citizens what may bo called the monopoly of the American domestic carrying trade by prohibiting foreign owned vessels from engaging in such trade. Year after year free-trnders havo assailed tho old navigation aws and demanded free trade in ships fear after year they havo demanded fi , for- eign vessel-owners the privilege of en gaging in tho domestic carrying trado the carrying trade between points on our coast, rixers and lakes. Only three Congresses since an effort was made, under tho leadership of tho chairman of tho House committee on commerce, a gentleman from Arkansas, to repeal the navigation laws and open the carrying1, trade of our coasts, rivers and lakes to the competition of all the world. This would have resulted in injury to oar growing commerce, as did the free trade on the ocean. Why not do it? Because, first, the Re publican policy is to retain to citizens of the United States all the advantages in all industries and business which is pos sible, and, second, because we may need all this tonnago in case of war, as wo did in 18(51, when it was necessary to blockade tho Southern ports. In the event of War these heavy iron ships in the lakes would be valuable for defense, and the "coasters" could furnish us thousands of trained seamen for our war ships, ns they did in 1812 and 1861. That we have to-day along our coasts, in the lakes and rivers the largest and most prosperous domestic merchant ma rine in the world, givi g employment to tens of thousands of men and profitable investment for millions of capital, i3 duo to that statesmanship whose first idea is the fostering of homo interests. This may seem of little importance to Indiana, but an American merchant ma rine which has power to compete in tho carrying trado with railroads, and to givo employment to tens of thousands of American citizens, is a matter of interest to every State. The Associated Press announces that Mr. Cooper, of Indiana, has declared a purpose to movo a rigid examination into the aflairs of tho Pension Bureau early in January, or as soon as ho has returned from attending to private busi ness at home and will bo at leisure to attend to congressional duties. Per haps, in view of the Cooper statement, it would bo more accurate to say that Mr. Cooper proposes to investigate Gen. Raum, since he is reported as declaring that he will not move an investigation of the bureau if the President will re move the Commissioner. If ho shall de sist from investigating if General Raum shall be removed, the public will be forced to assume that there aro no irreg ularities in the affairs of tho bureau. If there were he would not be warranted in declaring a purpose not to investigate. Tho difficulty of Mr. Cooper seems to bo that ho is opposed to having General Raum at the head of the Pension Bureau on personal grounds, and that ho will be satisfied as soon as that person shall have been removed. The position of Mr. Coopor may seem Kinexpiicauie under general principles, ibut it will be understood when it is re membered that Mr. Cooper is a member of an extensive pension claim agency, nnd that he, with others, may have causes of grievance because all of the cases which they havo reported for the "completed files" were found not to be completed and were put back to await more testimony.- But it is well to bear in mind, pending and during the Cooper performance, that there are no irregu larities in the Pension Bureau demand ing tiie probing of the pension claims statesman. ' Tiik Democratic Governor McKinney, of Virginia, in his message to the Legis lature of that State, the past week, said: I hope a spirit of perfect fairness will prevail, and. with the Constitution of, the St;ito as your guide and your authority for this important work, you may perform it so well as to disarm criticism, both at homo aud abroad, by giving to parties and sec tions complete justice in shaping tho dis tricts. That fair representation mav be given. let the districts be formed of "con tiguous counties, cities and towns, and be compact and include, as nearly as may be, un equal number of population." Such an apportionment is required by the Constitu tion, and is right. If several Northern Democratic Gov ernors had made such suggestions as the above, Democratic politicians in Michi gan could not havo defied decency by relegating the choice of presidential electors to congressional districts, and tho same class in Wisconsin could not have gloried in tho fact that if tho Re publicans should carry the Stato by thirty thousand, they could not elect a Legislature. If the Indiana Democracy which controlled tho last Legislature had been animated by sentiments ns honorable as this ex-confederato ex presses, a legislative apportionment would not have been made under which two-fifths of the voters can elect a ma jority of the Leginlature. A report of the British embassy in Berlin has recently reached the Foreign Office, in London, which contains these assf rtions: Tho number of workpeople in Germany hna .ncreased about - per cent, each year sine lbS2. and is now estimated to reach ncven millions, sinco 1SS3 a general rise in wanes hat tuken-phwo in mottt German in dustrial districts, and amounts to between 10 and 'JS per cent., while the cost of the necessaries of life has decreased. In 1S79 Germany changed from a freo trado or revenue policy to that of pro tection, which it has mado more and more protective by subsequent legisla tion. And yet our blind and deaf free traders go about parroting, "A tariff is a tax." Boss Crokkr, of Tammany Hnll, is credited with the following statement, which is of interest: Mr. Flower will servo New York Stato as Governor just one year, because on the 1st of January, lM'o, he will resign just us (irover Cleveland did, and for the same reason. If he lives until the 4th of March, 1 K,Xi. he w ill. if we can accomplish it. take the oath as President of the United States. The statesman with the $ qualifica tion may receive, through the aid of Tammany nnd his dollars, the Demo cratic nomination, but the people of this country will not elect a Wall-street man, puro and simple, to the ofiico of President. The action of the Chinese government in declining to receivo ex-Senator Blair ns miuister from tho United States has been variously commented on by the press, but tho President makes a sug gestion that has not been made bofore. He says he has felt constrained to point out to the Chinese government that its position in objecting to Mr. Blair on ac count of his support of the law against Chinese immigration is untenable bo causo "it Bccms to rest as much on the unacceptability of our legislation as on that of tho person chosen, and which, if admitted, would practically debar tho selection of any representative 6o long ns tho existing laws remain in force." Tho point is obvious when made, and is clearly well taken. .If Mr. Blair is ob- jcctionable because he voted for the ob noxious law, then every citizen of the United States who approves tho law is equally objectionable, and that would include nearly all American citizens. Logically, tho position of tho Chinese government comes pretty near beiug a refusal to receive any minister from the United States. Mrs. II l n G g h complains to tho extent of a colamn and a half in the Goshen Democrat that the Journal does not print anything about her. In retaliation for this treatment Mrs. Gg r declares that she has boycotted tho Journal, and no longer subscribes for it, The Journal had not dis covered this boycott, but, being now in formed of it by the vituperative madam herself, is moved to a casual wonder as to how she knows that she is never mentioned unless she reads the paper to find out. Is she, perhaps, one of those "constant read ers" who 'borriesT" Mr. McCulloch has left his own monu ment, in thevshapo of the associated chari ties and otMer benevolent institutions in whose establishment he was the prime mover. The best tribute the people of In dianapolis can offer to his memory is to see that these several enterprises are carried out as he planned them. Fraschs Willaki says: "One cannot but re flect tbat the amount of forco exerted to com press tho waists of women would. If azgregated, turn all the mills between Minneapolis and the Mcrrlmac." It is greater than that, Frances. Does not "love make the world go round!" A Boston paper has a poem addressed to the "Girls of Ninety-one." But ore girls really girls at ninety-one, even in Boston, where there are so many of all ages! Louisville seems to be under the influ ence of an unlucky star of late. Since tho cyclone struck it, a couple of years ago, it has had a run of 111 fortune.

PLYMOUTH'S PASTOR DEAD Eev. Oscar C McCulloch Loses the Mag nificent Fight He lias Made for Life. Passim: Away of a Man Who Has Pone Untold Good lor Humanity Ilis Great, Unselfish Work in the Field of Charity. MR. M'CCLI,OCirS DEATH. End of a Long and Heroic Straggle Against Fatal Disease. The annals of the world's battle-Gelds record no more heroic struggle against overwhelming odds than is told in tho sim ple story of Oscar C. McCnlloch's long, patient, determined fight against death. The man who could vitalize a weak and struggling church and build it up into a social and religious power, who could, al most single-banded, energize, systematize and consolidate all the humanitarian re sources of a great community, was found, at the certain approach of fatal disorder, posseesed of a mental and moral force suf ficient to beat off death, by sheer power of will, for days, aye, even weeks after all physical strength for resistance had been exhausted. ( It was ou Oct 8 last tbat Mr. Mc Culloch arose from his couch to perform a quiet marriage ceremony for a parish ioner and friend. When it was over he took to his bed, and the world saw him no more. A week later a few personal friends were made aware that he could not re cover. Yet a few days more and they learned that his death might be expected at any hour. Since then, for two months, an anxious family has watched at his bed side, and the shadow of death has never left the big elm. Hour by hour the shadow has crept closer and closer to the calm and patient hero lying almost within touch of the great tree's branches. Time and again, with a litlul leap, it has been-upon him; time and again that quiet, courageous, iron will has driven it back. Imt the unequal struggle could not last; there could bo but one em'. At 5:50 o'clock yesterday morning this life of untold usoftilneas was a thing of tho past, and Mr. McCultoch's soul was with his Maker. The end came peacefully, al most imperceptibly, and the watching family at the bedside scarcely knew when the sleep had become eternal. "From tho time that Mr. McCulloch took to his bed until his death' said Dr. O. 8. Runnels, "his decline has been gradual and without incident. Ten days ago evidences of stomach failure appeared and be was seized with occasional periods of vomit ing. This continued until last Saturday, when there was a total loss of power. From that time no food whatever was taken. He was c6nscioos all during his long illness,- except when under the influence of the opiates administered to quiet nervous excitability of the stomach. Between these periods of narcotic aotion he would be rational and at himself, except somewhat blunted by the action of the narcotic. After coining out of the narcosis he would, in a few minutes, be again seized with retching. As this threatened strangu lation the narcotic would have to be ad ministered. In this way ho would, have three or four periods of consciousness in the twenty-four hours. Until Saturday he had the newspapers read to him. and from the beginning of his illness until the beginuiug of the deep narcosis books and stories were read to him every day hours nt a time. He went down gradu ally, ns 1 have said, from the start, and ho may bo said to have had ease aud com parative comfort to the end of his illness. There was no pain or suiiering, only the restlessness incident to fatigue and nerv ousness. During the last twenty-four hours he was unable to speak except to utter r.n occasional yes or no. recog nized his wife two hours before his death." NATUHE OF THE FATAL ILLNESS. The medical history of Mr. McCulloch, as related by Dr. O. S. Runnels, who has been his physician for fourteen years, is one of singular interest, as showing the indomi table energy and remarkable will power of the man in a state of health that would have made almost any other, a confirmed invalid. "In bheboygau. Wis.," said the Doctor, "previous to bis coming here, be had his lirst break-down in health as a consequence of overwork, for in that city, as in Indianapolis, he was all activity in every good work. This failure in health took the form of a serious nervous prostration, and forced him to take a year's vacation, lie went to California, and when heroturned seemed to have regained his health, and his friends thought he was wholly restored. Two years later be was attacked by diphtheria, from which be re covered very slowly. Following this he was again overtaken with nervous prostra tion. He chanced to be iu Chicago, and for ten weeks was held iu that city. He was agaiu forced to go to California, where the climate and other conditions were favorable to his restoration to health. "He was subject to attacks of sick head ache and from the beginning of his work in Indianapolis to its close to periods of nerv ous depression. There has been no year sinoe his residenco here that he has not be5n forced to take a season of rest ou ac count of his health. This bus usually been in the months of August und September, ou account of periods chI attacks of hay fever. At other times he has been compelled to go away during tho winter and spring for a brief stay to recuperate ana get u breath ing spell. "Ou various cccasions it was demon strated that he possessed what is known as the hemorrhagic diathesis -a disposition to bleed under the slightest provocation. At one time, while in .New York, ho had a tooth pulled and started from that city to llostou. Whils on the train the flow of blood began, and the hemorrhage soon became excessive, so that fears were enter tained that he could not survive until the tram should reach i'ostou. From a slight razor cut upon the lace while iu Denver he bad a very alarming experience, as it was lound almost impossible to stop the bleeding. More recently an operation was performed to removo polypi from the nasal cavity as a possible cute lor his hay fever, and during treatment for a hemor rhoidal dithculty he came near to death through loss of blood. For thia reason he was a very bad snrgical sulijecu "The first evidence of his last difliculty was manifested shortly after he had an attack of la grippe in the winter of 1&IKK). While iu the bath one morniug. he noticed a pronouueed enlargement in the left groin. This proved.' upon exom luatiou, to be an enlarged lymphatic gland. Alter various remedial measures had failed, thisswelling was Dually reduced by application of the ice-bag. The ice-bag was omitted for a few weeks, and the tumor returned. It was again reduced by thesamo treatment; again returned; was reduced a third time, and again returned. By this time the spring of lfc'.'l had arrived aud bo bad projected the meeting in this city of the Sational Conference of Charities and Correction, llclieviug that tho long-continued application ot ice to the tumor was weakening, it was thought best to discon tinue it. Besides, there was the further reason, that bis duties iu connection with the conference demai.ded bis time, and did not udmit of the treatment. Just be!ore the assembling of the conference, dis covery was made that the growth had made inroads into the abdom Oscar C. McCulloch.. inal cavity. His health was very seriously injured, and it was the wonder aud admi ration of those who knew his bodily coudi tion that ho could conduct such a confer ence at all, much less iu the signally suc cessful manner he did. It was the most marvelous display of energy, tact and skill in conducting a large body that this city of conventions has ever known, and was commented npon by the daily press, which gave to Mr. Mc Culloch the greatest praise for his work as an organizer and as a presiding otbeer.' Had his physical condition been known the wouder would have transcended nil bounds. Most men in his state of health would have been wholly uuable to assume such an arduous task. He insisted npon the lull performance of every duty and was at his post throughout "Following the conference he made prep arations to go to Kurope to personally con duct a party of tourists. This journey bad been arranged months beforehand, aud ho insisted, against tho advice of his physicians and friends, upon fulfilling tho contract. He mado the tour, attend ing to all the details of the trip, and came to Antwerp, where the tourists dis persed, in seemingly as good condition as when he embarked at Sew York. He took a short trip in Holland with his wife, intending immediately thereafter to sail for home, but was prostrated at The Hague with what seemed to be malarial fever. "Through the advice of the American con sul there he consulted Dr. Blomcoster. the oldest practitioner of the city, and who is the court physician and a very able man. This physician, desiring the ad vice of a younger mind, called in consultation the director-general of the f reat hospital at that place. Dr. Van Ten ioven. After holdiug repeated consulta tions on successive days, '.t was the opinion of these gentlemen that the morbid growths were benign in character, and that they would not interfere with his life tenor; that tho fever which had been rag ing as high even as IO0V2 Fahrenheit was malarial in its nature." Dr. Runnels here intimated that ho thought these physicians knew more than they divulged, and what tbey did was done in kindness, tbat Mr. anil Mrs. Mc Culloch might return homo before know ing the full seriousness of his condition. HIS 

LAST SERMON'. With this assurance," continued Dr. Runnels, "and in high hopes they sailed from Antwerp on the 12th of September, reached New York on the C2d and Indian apolis on the 23tb. On the following Sun day, Sept. 27, Mr. McCulloch preached twico at Plymouth, and on Monday made a trip to Sheboygan, stopping on the way at Chicago, where I was sick, to see me. I desired him to have a consultation npon his case, and it was held. The result dashed the high hopes that bad been raised. At that time he had taken 234 grains of quinine, aud his fever was reaching an average of 102J aud 103J in the evening. This condition was not malarial, but came, of course, from the morbid growths. It was decided that these growths were neither cancerous nor sarcomatous, but of tuberculous character, and unless they could be removed by snrgical interference there was no hope. Taking Mr. McCulloch'a hemorrhagic diathesis into consideration, the low physical condition in which he then was and the very formidable charac ter of tho proposed operation, it was de cided that the measure proposed was extra hazardous, and that he could not survive it. It was, therefore, abandoned, aud the hopeless fight against odds began. "There has been no time withiu the last eight mouths, probably, when he has not had daily an abnormal temperature of from two to six degrees. He has been burning up for -nearly a year. During bis Knropean trip his fever was succeeded by night-sweats, but lassitude never over took him. In Switzerland ha took an eleven mile tramp up and down a mountain. When it was found that they would bo pressed for time on the way down be made three and a half miles on a steep grade very rapidly and succeeded in getting to the train on the minute. For the first hour after Mr. Mc Culloch got on the train it was thought he would certainly4 die. He himself dated his rapid decline from that time. . It was two or three days after this that he reached Antwerp, the end .of the. journey. The most pronounced expression of his will power appears right there; tbat he should have been able tp reach Antwerp at alL "His will allowed no, -allure. lie -never brooked a disappointment. AVhen he be gan au enterprise of any kind be saw its consummation with as much certainty as anything not fully executed could be seen. He bad the will of a czar and run every thing in which he took part. He would ap point committees to do certain work and then they would find nothing to do. he hav ing performed the work himself. His raind was active day and night. Some of the brightest sermons he ever preached wero composed between bis house and the church. His sermons were always pre pared on Sunday morning. Ho was so busy a man that he had no leisure at any other time in the week. He would get up at 5 o'clock on Sunday morning, and work out his sermon by breakfast time, it was no uncommon thing for him to find another sermon between bis bouse and the churcb, and ou getting upon the platform to preach would deliver an entirely ditlerent dis course from the one that he had prepared." The two sermons preached by Mr, Mc Culloch at Plymouth Church on Sunday, SeDt, 27, were the last he ever delivered. After his examination on the following Monday in Chicago by Dr. O. S. Runnells, with other physicians, having received full and true information as to his condition, he returned to his home and issued a cir cular to his congregation statiug that he would not occupy., his, . pulpit for two months. Dr. Runnels said last night to a Journal reporter: "1 would like to corrcot a slight error iu a published statement in regard to Mr. McCulloch'a European tour. I tried to dissuade him' from tak ing it. it is true, but when be returned I wan convinced that it had done him good. His mind was occupied with pleasant things all the time. Had ho remained at home 1 am satisfied he would have been in a sick-bed most of the time." An autopsy was made yesterday by Drs. O. S. Runnels. II. It. Allen, W. 15. Fletcher and Sollis Runnels. The initial tumor, which appeared in the left groiu two years ago. was an enlarged lymphatic gland, and proved to be one end of a chain of diseased lymphatic glands. This chain extended under Poupart's ligament, around the basin of the iliuim to tho verte bral column und up tho column on both sides a high as the fifth dorsal vertebra. At this point the glands were no longer grouped into the diseased mass, but were segregated, widely desseminated and of various sizes. The mssentery, the liver, the spleen, the pancreas and the kid neys tvere studded with tubercular depos its. The lnugs, heart and stomach did not give evidence of invasion. The "chain" was dissected away en masse the ditlerent glands compos. ng it varying in size from a pigeon's egg to that of a goose egg. The diagnosis of glandular tuberculosis was es tablished. Surgery could not have served any purpose. FUN EISA L ARKANGEMENTS.

SKETCHED BRIEFLY. flow Mr. McCnllcxh Was Ilrought to IndU anapolis What lie Has Accomplished. Oscar Carlton McCulloch was born in Fremont, O., July 2, 1S43. Here ho received a common school education and gained a knowlege of business, his father, why had been educated as a. physician, being en gaged in the drug trade. At a later period his father went to Chicago, and entered into the wholesale drug business as one ot the firm of Gillette, McCulloch & Co. The son took service with the bouse, and was for years one of its commercial travelers or "drummers." Ho was a long-distance man, and traveled as far west as California and as far south as Texas. That he was a good salesman is evidenced by the fact tbat he gave up a salary of $3,500 a year to enter the Con gregational Theological Seminary of Chi cago. It was here that he and Rev. Myron W. Reed, formerly of this city, now of Den ver, became acquainted and formed an at tachment that continued through life. From the seminary Mr. McCulloch went to Sheboygan, is., locating there as the pastor of a congregational churcb, and where he was for seven years the minister of the same con gregation. Sheboygan was a place of about seven thousaud Germans and one thousand Americans, and Mr. McCulloch soou became a very busy man, interested in all that made for a better condition of life, spiritual and physical. HIS FIUST SERMON IN INDIANAPOLIS. In the year 1S77, when Plymouth Church, of this city, was looking about for a pastor. Rev. Myron W. Reed mentioned the name of his school friend to some of the members. A church committee, consisting of H. C Hammond, D. S. Alexander and Dr. O. S. Runnels, went to see Mr. Reed, who spoke in such terms of the Sheboy gan pas tor tbat the committee determined to try to get him. He was telegraphed to. and responded that he would preach for tho Plymouth congregation on the following Sunday. He preached bis lirst sermon here on April 29, 1677, and on May Afollow ing, a call was extended to him. He bad made a very marked impression, and the call was unanimous. Mr. McCulloch, bow ever, although receiving a salary of only 1,000, was reluctant to accept. Plymouth o tie red him 2,100, but the temptation did not lie in the salary. He had done great things tn Sheboygan, aud bis work was going on. Ho said the rela tionship proposed was one to be en tared into with caution, and suggested that he make a second trip to Indian apolis And spend a month here, so that both parties to the proposed .contract might be eotne better acquainted, and know whether nch an arrangement would bo agreeable. He came and preached for four Sundays in the month of June, 1877, at the end ot which time the call was extended more heartily than before. Mr. McCulloch was in doubt, and fearing a declination, the church committee was sent to Sheboygan. They left that place after a long consulta tion with Mr. McCulloch convinced that it was a hopeless case. On the afternoon of the day on which the cemmitteo left, be wrote a letter to the church declining tho call. Later in the day he attended ilar n urn's circus, for he was always where peo ple were to be found, and the advent of a circus in a small town like Sheboygan was a great event, and while there thought the matter out, determined to accept and tele graphed accordingly. He began his pastorate here July 20. 1S77, in what is now English's Hall (on North Meridian street), then Plymouth Church. He came to a church weak financially and weak in membership. The building was nominally owned by the congregation but loaded with mortgages to its full valua tion, so that when it was de termined to build a new edifice but 500 was realized out of the old building. The old church having been sold, the congregation worshiped in Dick son's (Jrand Opera-house for a year while the new building was in process of erec tion. Here Mr. McCulloch's energy and rare business tact had full play. The task of erecting a groat building with as little capital to go upon as appenred in sight was looked upon as a wild and visionary scheme that could only result in failure. Tho money for tho purchase of tho ground, $10,500, was raised in tho congregation, lionds in tho amonnt of $2.,Ono were then issued upon the property to secure fnnds for the erection of the building. These bonds were readily disposed of at par to capitalists, only one or two men iu the con gregation being able to buy any. The plan of tho building comprised a largo audienee rooin, admirablo for all purposes of speak ing and music, and other rooms for social gatherings, club meetings, etc. The inter est on the bonds has been easily met out of the rentals of these rooms. The property has been admirably managed. Otherfunds were raised to buy the organ and furnish the church. This large amount was fur nished by the congregation. The entire cost of the building and fur nishing was about S40.U-a All the floating debt has been paid and a portion of the bonded debt has been redeemed. Mr. Mc Culloch was just getting ready to pay olf another 10.0(X) ot the debt, intending to make thHt his winter's work. The organ in the church is a $10,000 instrument, though tho circumstances under wb;cl it was built made it cost considerably les. The congregation rented theorgan factory of Sanborn t Co., this city, and paid the workmen. i'rofetsor Church, a skilled man ufacturer, a member of Plymouth, over- ceeing the work. MANY CALLS ELSEWHERE. Mr. McCulloch's salary has been nomi nally $1,000, though every member of tho church conceded that amount far below hisdeserving. He has bad repeated calls to other places at inducements of the most flattering kind, both as to congenial sur roundings and largely-increased salary. All these offers be lirmly declined. Tno congregation and the work pleased him: nothing could induce him to take bis band Irom the plow alter be Lad set it in the furrow. Mr. McCulloch was an inspiration to all with whom he came in contact. He inspired to the most heroic giving by bis congregation, and no c hurch, in proportion to the wans of its members, has ever given as has Plymouth. There is a little anecdote in connection with the beginning of hie work with tho Jiidianapolis Uenevolcnt Society. Rev, William Alvin Hartlett. D. D.. pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church, caws to tho annual meeting of the society, bfldintho First I'resbyteriau Church, at which but lew more than a dozen persona were present.
