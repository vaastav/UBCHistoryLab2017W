Mhe liaiioUci)cmocvaL (SthavloUe, j-1 IK DEMOCRAT. W.M J. YATES, Editor and Proprietor. CHARLOTTE, N C. Friday, December 5, 1879. Congress. Ti,h bady American politicians and some head statesmen, assembled in Washington on !onl;iy last and began operations far the Winter t Summer. being what is known as the jVMtlential-making session, it will continue pro bultly until the latter part of next Summer. In fact, if members choose, the session can be pro lonir'l to the 4th of March, 1881, when a new Ad ministration will be inaugurated. Correspondents, who have talked with and inter viewed nvmy of the members, say that everybody lias a conservative feeling, and that among the Democrats there h not much disposition to renew tlie wrangle and contention which marked the Kvtra Session last Spring that no one is willing to "father" tint extra session or hurrah for the issues made at that time. It is generally the case tiuit after a sch-m or plan has proven disastrous, Imt few, if any, are willing to stand up for it, though they might h ire been very willing an 1 ready to denounce those who cautioned them against the virulence and hasty action they formerly exhibited. The stand m-ule at the extra session for States' Kinlits was rght and proper, notwithstanding there was much folly and imprudence on the part of some of the friends of that great and just prin ciple. 5 fur, nothing has been done of any importance The recommendations of President Hayes contain nothinsr striking or startling, or demanding very particular at'ention. Members of Congress don't iay much attention to Annual Messages in these times, for the most of them consider themselves smarter than the President. On the assembling of both Houses there was a general friendly greeting between members of all parties, and Radicals and Democrats appeared as loving as young kittens in a basket of cotton. If back-country people suppose members of Congress arc mad and in a righting spirit when they use harsh and ugly words toward each other in debate, they are very much mistaken. The fuss is made for their constituents and to make the imprrssion that each man is standing up for their rights. President Hayes has nominated the present Secretary of War, Mr McCrary, to beU. S. Judae in Iowa, and ex-Senator Ramsay of Kansas, to be Secretary of War in place of McCrary. tST The U. S. District Court meets in this City on Monday next. Judge Dick will preside and transact all the business that can be done in the absence of Judge Bond, who, it is understood, can not attend here next week. We learn that if Judge Dick, after transacting the regular business, will adjourn Court to the 20lh, Judge Bond will then attend and hear such cases as demands his presence. We presume Judge Dick will make that arrange ment, unless there is some unsurmountable obstacle to prevent. fc South Carolina. On the South Carolina Leg islature now in session at Columbia, it is under stood, devolves the duty of electing three Judges of the Supreme Court for that State. Turns are a number of candidates for the places, (Gov. Simp son among the rest) and it is said that a squabble lias occurred by the present Chief Justice, Willard, claiming to hold over. He was originally elected to take the place of Moses, deceased, but he now contends that it was for six years, and not for any shorter period. The question should be determined by the Supreme Court, but as Associate Justice Mclver is a candidate for the Chief Justiceship, and Willard is also interested, it is hard to tell how the matter can be settled. 3?" The papers in all directions in the South have committed an error in stating that the Supreme Court of the United States had decided that the Virginia law against marriages between blacks and whites, was unconstitutional. The U. S. Supreme Court has made no such decision, but granted a Writ of Error so that the question can be tested in the highest Courts. We aim to keep the word "Boom" out of our columns, as unmeaning Yankee slang; and we hope our Southern Editorial brethren will drop such phrases as "boom," "stalwarts," &c. News paper matter should be put in such plain and sim ple language that the most illiterate reader can un derstand what is meant by names or phrases. Please leave off "boom" and say combination, or arrangement, or party, or use some word that has some meaning ; and in the place of "stalwart" why not say Radical. fc IW Judge Bynum says he is not correoily re ported by the Asheville Journal, in regard to the Conversation he had about politics in this State, lleun.l Judge Buxton had an ordinary conversa tion with the Editor of the Journal, but he never thought that it would be published as a regular in terview, and he very properly thinks it an outrage for any newspaper to publish private conversations. We think that sort of business is becoming a very great nuisance to public as well as private men. Large Yield According to report made at Cumberland County Agricultural Fair, Mr R F.

My friend R. had a daughtei married a few years ago; and she and her young husband went out to lexas "to grow up with the country." The young folks went out toward the frontier, where land is plenty and cheap. They gave the old folks no rest "Come out; do come. "Oh, that you were here. Land so rich cheap grass stock health, &c. By and by R. and his wife yielded to the entreaty of children who seemed to lack noth ing but the parental presence and participation In their blessings, to make them happy. They sold out their little home and stock and went to Texas. I met him in October long face; heavy heart; sad story. He and wife, with their two younger children, reached the promised land in August; took lodgings in the prairie with their married children, and rejoiced for a month or so over the grandchild. They found them getting ready to re turn to Tennessee; and return they did, despite of parental entreaty ! Now they are as far apart as ever. Said my friend R. to me, "We had spent pretty much all we had following our children to Texas, and when they turned back we could fol low them no further. The movement to Upper Texas is from the Southern part of the State as well as from other States. Cattle growing is very profitable in the lower prairie stretches, near the coast. Fenced fields or pastures are not uncommon which enclose 50,000 acres. Poor people and small farmers must move away are crowded out. With all the dili gence of preachers, there is a decrease of member ship in these regions. One is reminded of a couplet in the Deserted Village." Proper Remarks from Colored People. A paper published at Raleigh by colored men, and devoted to the interests of the negro race, speaking of the late Industrial Fair gotten up and held by colored people, says: "The deep interest taken by the white people of North Carolina in the success of the late Industrial Fair is such as should challenge the highest admi ration of all. They have demonstrated to the world that there is no natural antagonism existing between the two races in this State, and that the colored people have no better friends than are to found among the better class of the white people. We were never so proud as when we saw the white people of North Carolina, regardless of party, coming forward with warm heart and gen erous hand to the assistance of their colored fellow citizens in their struggle for a higher and nobler manhood. It furnished an additional confirmation of what we have always said of them both in our private and public utterances, and through the public prints, to-wit: that no better people dwell on the face of the globe than the people of North Carolina. What an argument for peace, for unity, for friendly co-operation between the races was shown on our Fair grounds last week ! We would have had the whole country witness the spectacle. Now what we want in North Carolina is to be let alone. We can live together and live on the best of terms if the politicians will only keep off hands and let us work the thing in our own way." Yes, indeed, if the negro is let alone by politi cians North and South, and if candidates will quit using him as a mere voting tool, he will be more prosperous and there will be less crime among his race. One thing above all others should be im pressed on the minds of the colored people of this State, and that is, that only those who work will thrive that no white man ever got rich or lived respectably who did not work hard that negro boys and girls and youths must work as well as grown-up people, and tliat education will do them very little good unless it is accompanied with in dustry, morality and sobriety. -n KW At the North, Thanksgiving day wa? ob served by such fellows as nenry Ward Beecher abusing the South from his pulpit. A preacher like Beecher, who has been convicted of adultery with female members of his own congregation, is a fair specimen of the slanderers of the South. Siiame. The Shelby Aurora states that there is an old man in the Poor House of Cleaveland coun ty who has sixty grand-children. Can it be possi ble that there is not one among all that number of grand-children who could take care of the poor old man and make his last days pleasant and comfort able without letting him be on the county as a charity charge ? The meanness of some people, oh how great ! But we are told that right here in Mecklenburg, people of property and who are well able to take care of their near kin, apply to the County Com missioners for an allowance in money for their sup port. The New York World and the New York Sun, both professing Democratic principles, are not true friends to the South. The sly inuendoes of the World, and the bolder assertions of the Sun against the South, does us more harm than if they came from open and avowed Radical journals. It is rather degrading to Southern pride to know that both papers are largely patronized by Southern people. It may be that Southerners take the Yan kee reprints because they can get them for about one-half of what they would have to pay for a de cent home paper. But seme people love to patron ize enemies in preference to friends, so as to appear magnaminous. Capt. Thos. Jeff. Robinson, Secretary of the N. C. Agricultural Board, died at hishame in Fay etteville n the 27th ult. He was an efficient officer and a good and true man. The Raleigh News says that Capt. Robinson was scarcely cold before there were about 100 applica tions for his place as Secretary of the Board. m 3F" Madison county, away up in the Mountains of Western North Carolina, raised the past season one hundred thousand dollars' worth of tobacco. Can't the farmers of Mecklenburg, Gaston, Lincoln, Cabarrus and Union be induced to try cultivating tobacco.

Bad State of Society. The Courts in Massachusetts are revealing a very bad and horrible state of society in that State. At a recent Court in Barnstable, Mass., Judge Lord presiding, six or eight divorces were granted in one day, and the Judge, after hearing the caes, re marked : "It is shocking to contemplate the state of mor als in this great commonwealth that is here to be observed. The law says desertion for three years is cause for a divorce. But I see clearly how it operates. A 3Toung man and woman agree to get married. They feel that they'll live together so long as they find it mutually pleasant and agreeable so to do, and then, by a sort of tacit understanding, they can live separate, and then one or the other at the end of three years brings in a libel for divorce for desertion. The other party makes no opposi tion. The decree is granted, and then they are at liberty to go on and do the same thing over and over again. I say it is terrible to contemplate such a state of morals in this commonwealth. Out of all the large number of divorce cases before me recently, there were only two of the persons mar ried before 1870 ? Does net this show that young people are entering into this solemn contract with the most trivial ideas of its importance, and with the feeling that they can be freed from the bonds whenever they like ? I am not responsible for the laws as they stand. But I will say that, so far as I can prevent it, they shall not be used to facilitate the development of such a state of morals." m - County Matters. The Mecklenburg Board of Commissioners held their regular monthly meeting, beginning on Mon day last and ending Thursday. The following is the most important business transacted : The Board refused to confirm the report of a committee to lay off a new public road beginning at the South end of Trade street and running through the lands of Mr Torrence and others. The matter has been before the Board a long time, and this action kills the proposed road. ( ' $186 38 was allowed Clerk of Inferior Court for half fees in insolvent State cases, and Sheriff Alex ander for Jail fees for November $257.26. Robt. Grier, E J. Funderburk and J. T. Burnett were appointed to examine the Bridge across Four Mile Creek leading from Robt. Grier'sto Matthews' Station, and have necessary repairs made and re port to Board. The former appointment of School Committee men for District No. 59 was revoked, and the citi zens of that District requested to meet at the school house on the 13th of December and recom mend three persons to serve as committeemen. The p y of Supervisors of Roads was fixed at $2 per day when actually engaged in the discharge of duty. $41.70 was allowed Coroner Alexander for in quests in two cases, and $10 to Dr. Wilder for a post mortem examination. R J Dempster was appointed Constable for Morn ing Star Township, in the place of T. II. Wilson, resigned. He gave bond with Jos. McLaughlin and T. C. Wilson as sureties. It was ordered that the Road Supervisors be paid at the rate of $2 per da , and that the payment of the accounts be def rred until the Sheriff's settle ment in February. George Adler, a convict who has served out hi3 term of sentence, was ordered to be released. The Clerk of the Board was ordered to notify the State Treasurer of the permanent organization of the Fair of the Carolinas, and draw the $50 to which the Society is entitled under provisions of Battle's Revisal. The bill of I. A. Frazier for building a Bridge across Sugar Creek,, on the old plank road, ($124,) was ordered to be paid. T. L. Vail, J. R. Erwin and J. L. Brown were appointed a Committee to look after the matter of providing clothing for the county convicts at work on the chain gang. Washington Dunn was appointed Supervisor of Road District No. 25, in Paw Creek Township, in place of M. E. Kistler. The usual bills for the support of paupers and for other county purposes were passed. The following resolution was passed : Resolved, That the Board of Education for the County of Mecklenburg recommend to Teachers of Public Schools in said county that they adopt and use in their schools the books recommended by the State Board of Education. m Coroners and their Inquests. Massachusetts has aboli.-heil Coroners and their juries, and inquests in that State are now conducted by medical men, under the instructions of the Courts as to their legal functions. The results ot the change thus far are said to have been admirable, and there seems no reason why they should be otherwise. The jury is but a cumber some institution in the case of inquests, neither facilitating the inquiry nor render ing it more complete, while it takes men away from their business and causes loss and inconvenience to them. A more im portant inquiry, however, than the one as to the practicability of the transfer of the duties of Coroner, is that as to reducing the cost of the holding of inquests. In many counties this one among others this is a very serious burden. Every week or two the Coroner holds an inquest and for each of these the county is saddled with a bill of costs ranging all the way from $12 to $25. In some counties the duties of Coroner are merely nominal, but in the populous counties they are frequently called upon to discharge the functions of their offices. Frequently it happens that their services have been invoked without any sufficient cause, but their duties are dis charged, nevertheless, and they collect their bills, as they have aright to do. The question, therefore, we say, of re ducing the cost of the holding of inquests, or of reducing the classes of cases on which they may sit, is one of more practical im portance than the . mere question of who shall discharge the duties. Often it occurs that inquest are held when there are and can be no grounds for suspicion that death resulted from other than natural causes, and where, therefore, there is no necessity for an inquest. It is the regulation of this matter to which economists may well ad dress themselves. Charlotte Observer. We endorse the above, and join our neighbor in calling attention to a growing burden, if not evil. Suffering i.v Ireland. An appeal for subscriptions to alleviate the distress in Ireland was read in all the churches in Lon don on Sunday last. It is stated that in West Ireland such hunger, poverty and want are now to be seen as have never been known since the great Irish famine. JThe Greenville (Pitt county) Ex press says: "Between 60 and 75 negroes from the Black Jack and Haddock's X Roads sections, in this county, have left within the past week for Indiana.

Financial Chronicle For the cotton week ending Friday even ing, Nov. 28th, the total receipts have reached 249,152 bales, against 218,408 bales last week, 220,216 bales the previous week, and 225,087 bales three weeks since; mak ing the total receipts since the 1st of Sept., 1879, 2,134,998 bales, against 1,730,234 bales for the same period of 1878, showing an in crease since Sept. 1st, 1879, of 404,764 bales. The exports for the week are 113,650 bales, of which 59,072 bales were to Great Britain, 6,605 bales to France, and 47,979 bales to rest of the Continent, while the fetocks are 683,031 bales. Compared with the corresponding date of last season, there is a decrease in the exports this we. k of 4,933 bales, while the stocks on Fi iday night were 71,651 bales more than the were a year agp. The visible Mipply of cotton is 1,9S4,G47 bales, against 1,836,177 bales in 1878. The above figures indicate an inert ae in the cotton in bight on Friday night o: 148, 470 bales as compared with the same dale of 1878, an increase of 133,054 bales as com pared with the corresponding date of 1877, and a decrease of 517,683 bales as compared with 1876. The stocks in 1879 are 264,183, against 205,012 bales in 1878. The total receipts from plantations since Sept. 1st, 1879, were 2,391,880 bales; in 1878, 1,930,494 bales', and in 1877. 1,640, 117 bales. The weather the past week has been, as a general thing, favorabL- for gathering in the crop. Probably, taking the country together, this has been as good a season as was ever known for maturing the top crop, and securing the cotton in good condition. Picking this year will be generally finished from December 1st to December 20th a very large section of the country at the former date. N. Y. Breadstuff's Market, &o. The flour market was strong and more active early in the week partly in sympa thy with the advance in wheat but dull ness and depression succeeded ; the improve ment in prices, as compared with last Fri day, is but slight. The wheat market, felt the effect early in the week of a revival of speculative confidence, growing out of the continuance of comparatively Email receipts at the Western markets, better foreign ad vices and some reduction of the visible sup ply. Indian corn made an advance. Rye is held higher, checking business. Oats have been in speculative demand at advanc ing prices. Speculation in staples of merchandise have proceeded with some degree of activity, but confidence that the future will bring a higher range of values has been greatly weakened, and a feverish, unsettled tone prevails, which threatens a temporary decline. Notwith standing these drawbacks, general business has continued, active. iV. Y. Financial Chronicle. The Co item Question. Mr W. B. Forwood, a prominent mer chant of Liverpool, President of the Liver pool Chamber of Commerce and of the In ternational Cotton Exchange, has been on a visit to Atlanta, and has been giving his views about the future of cotton. Accord ing to his statement the rise in the price of cotton started in Liverpool by accident. He says that a large operator there, finding that, at the close of the last season, the stock on hand was very low, bought heavi ly of October deliveries. When the time came for settling there was not enough cot ton on hand to fulfill the contracts, and for the first time in English history, it was found that the great staple was "cornered." The "shorts" then became eager to pur chase to fill their contracts, and thus the rise was effected. New York operators seeing this, and really not understanding the real state of the case, began to push up the price briskly. Immediately a wild era of speculation set in, and the whole coun try was carried away with the idea that there were immense fortunes to be made in cotton. Buyers began buying wildly, and continue so to do, declaring that they will be able to carry the price up yet to 15 cents. This, however, Mr Forwood thinks will not be accomplished. He 6ays that already cotton is bringing more in this country than it is in Liverpool, and he does not think that the Liverpool market will ever advance to a point which will make it profitable to buy here for shipment there. He thinks the American crop will be 200,000 bales in excess of last year, and that England this year will receive 200,000 more from Egypt, 200,000 more lrom India, and 50,000 more from Brazil than she did last, a total excess in receipts over last year of 650,000 bales. He says also that the high est estimate of increased demand in Eu rope is 150,000, which will leave 500,000 bales of excess to be handled. He, there fore, is unable to see how present prices can be maintained much less advanced. Death of Dr. Strudwick by Poison:. The many friends of Dr. Edmond Strud wick, of Ilillsboro, will be pained to learn of his sudden death on Saturday last. On Saturday morning Dr. Strudwick received a telegram announcing the serious illness of his son, Fred. Strudwick, Esq., who was on the train returning home from one of h& Courts. He repaired to the depot at Ilills boro to meet his son, whom he found dan gerously ill, and taking him to bis office, the nearest point he could get him to, was treat ing his case, and having prescribed bella dona, had placed three drops in a glass to be diluted by water. Soon after,l having occasion to use the glass himself, he, by mis take, took the same1 glass and 'drank the whole dose. He soon discovered his fatal mistake by the effects of the deadly poison, and every effort was made to relieve him, but to no purpose, and he ended his long and useful life about 10 o'clock that night. Dr. Strudwick was in his seventy-seventh year. Raleigh News. Destructive Fire Winston". A fire caught from the stove-pipe in Thompson's Drugstore in the Joyner Block at 11 A.

There cannot be much "hard times" about here, considering the way the "Play House" or Opera House is filled at every performance. tW The Streets have been crowded with wagons during the past week, and trade has been very brisk. tW We call the attention of -the police to the loud profanity often indulged in on Trade street almost nightly by drunken and rowdy persons, both white and black. There is an ordinance against profane swearing on the streets, and it should be strictly enforced. If these persons have no respect for themselves, they should be forced to have some for public decency and the laws of tbe city and society. Soutliern Ilome. We have heretofore alluded to the profanity on the public stieets, and the blocking up of pave ments and street corners by a vulgar, profane crowd of m gro men, boys and women. It is a shame to the City.

At negro corn shuckings and frolics in the surrounding country several murders, woundings, &c , with knives and pistols, have cenrred.
