' V _ V An Evening Echo. Country 18 not a mere zone of territory. Th.e true country is tbe ideal to which It gives birth; It is the thought^of love, the sense of comjnunJon.'' which unites in one all sons of the r territory.?JOSEF# MiAZzini. - : ? No -one has beard of the present Adamsthn Administration's being a brilliant success. There are Ulcely to be some radical changes out there within about three more full moons.: Some.,of the bridge approaches in] tlae. suburbs' of the city are pronounced unsafe and at other ] bridges,-;there Is no protection to pedestrians. whatever. Those in] authority should look after these at; once, t . i v 'Negotiations seem well under; way tor a street car line to North- ] view. It Is hoped that they will be' successful. That bustling suburban 1 'town is entitled to easy access to the city and a street car line to Northview certainly would start that place to (booming rapidly. Harassing Jurors. It Is reported that criminal court { furors are being harassed by per-; sons who make it their particular business to reprimand jurors after verdicts have been returned. These i alleged jbusy-bodles have their own Ideas as to what should happen to i men.on trial, and if juries fail to return verdicts conforming to such1 ideas, the jurors are told by them j that they did not do their duty.' There ought to be some way to pro-< tect men from such insults. reprimands and harassing who are commanded by the state to do jury; duty. They are not there of their i own lrep will as a usual thing and most of them would prefer not to doj Jury duty. Why should they be made victims of adverse criticism' because their verdicts do not sult-j designers and meddlers? The pracblca is a -peril to justice as there may be men on juries some- ! times who tbus finding themselves ] criticized by men who ought to, know better may be Influenced Ifij later trials to act to some extent at least so as to allay such further; criticism. . 'Especially. is this true in the. trials, of colored and foreign-born; persons. These busy-bodies engender j class hatred. fTbey should be given to understand mat jurors are uu important part of a court and that persons have no more moral right at least to approach and reprove them | tor their verdicts than such persons or anyone else would have to reprlimand the trial judge because they differed from him as to Mai sentences. Shopping at Home. The duty tb do Christmas shopping early is not nioro imperative than to do-Christmas shopping and all other kinds of shopping at home, if possible. C'.lvlc patriotism Is discredited every time anyone runs away from Clarksburg to buy goods elsewhere. , To do shopping at home is a thing dictated also toy aelf-lnterst: for there la no' form of bus!ness or professional life that Is not indirectly benefited by loyalty to local tores. The more goods home merchants sell, the more work ?here Is for every one whose prosperity depends upon the wealth, the size and the activity of Clarksburg. United we stand, divided wo iali. All for each and each for all (Spend your money ut home and It [XPer will come iacfcsto *ou. Art tliera tiny among u> who speak of making purchases In Pitts-1 burg'or New York <#lth pride? Then let n? admonish them that they [should acknowledge each action-i*ejlucthntly and with shame. let them reflect how such action Would appear to them it they /were the haone merchants discriminated against in this disloyal fashion. As a general 'rale, nothing can be obtainedMn the shopfi dt other ' cities, that can not be obtained heM. See what , confidence' feome merchants have shown In providing these splendid emporiums crammed with articles adapted to the most exacting taste and to the'slenderest purse. IDo we not all 1 owe them tribute of loyal support? , Anti-Trust Records. >An appendix to President Taft's message to the ICongreee on the antl-trnst subject Is of more than ordinary importance as it Is a concise review of what the court! and ! various administrations have bees and are doing under the Sherman anti-trust law.v. Beginning with tbe administration of President Hajr'son, (President Taft shows that the department of justice' brought' Seven suits under that law and won three. {During the second administration of Grover i Cleveland the government prose! cuted eight, suits and won four. Un ! der IMcKinley three suits were instituted and two- won. "With the! Roosevelt Administration forty-four i suits were instituted and the gov-] [eminent obtained favorable action; , on twenty-three of them with aev- j dral pending. Thus far within the Taft adminls tration thirty^seven court actions j have be en. brought under the Sherman anti-trudt~1aW. Many of them; are of too - recent date . to be at the. stage of decree in both the lower and higher courts, hut there haa ibeen favorable action In eight or ten cases and combinations have been dissolved in several instances. Besides in* the neighborhood of $200,000 in Ones has been imposed, thei major portion of Which has been col-! lected. In view of this record, it Is not a I matter of trufTT to say that thej trusts have not been vigorously; prosefuted under the anti-trust law.; especially during the administrations of former President 'Roosevelt and .President Taft. Those who have any conception of court pro-j cedure at all must confess that the department of justice has been very busy and the success attained emphasizes the vigorous manner employed in breaking up combinations and monopolies. The anti-trust records of # Roose-: velt and Taft are not to be despised by any except those in sympathy with trusts and monopolies. Away Ahead. On the score of progressiveness; .k.ni.nrh ih.

The Parkersburg newspaper also recognizes that there is much more to be gained through the united effort of a large number of business men of a community than through the efforts of only a' few and in this both new and old members of the Clarksburg Board, of Trade have cause for gratification and encouragement. ISays the ?.lspatch-Newj: ' The people of'Huntington, Charleston, Clarksburg, Morgantown and Fairmont have rallied magnificently; to the support of their chambers of commerce or boards of trade, hundreds of business men in each town joiulng Just to help ont~'wlth a} f membership fee. And yet, the board of commerce of Parkersburg, goes plodding along with less than one hundred paying members, and : doing as succeasful work for >Par. kersburg as any. of these richer conj temporaries have done or are doing for their respective cities.
