IT Th Tmett In an arti cle on the Atabama etal mi, saysi If Mr. Motley proposes that ne tHtatlons for the settlement of the Alabaj n claims bo re opened at Washington, tht 1 proposal will be accepted. Wo must add that It would bo useless to negotiate, or talk of negotiating, nnlesseach side Is prep red to enter upon tho negotiation with confij lenco tn the honor of the other. The charge made by the Americans Is that wo did n t show tho proper feeling towards them daring tbe wart that our want of proper feollng led us to afford unfair assistance to their enemies. Th defence Is that Jt waa our duty to abstain from showing; a feeling toward either aide, and that th alleged unfair as sistance was the strict observance of neu trality. It Is plain that satisfactory rela tions between the two eoantrlos cannot bo restorsd until wo understand and respect tbe craving of the Americans for Sympathy, and they understand tha difficulties of our situation as Impartial bystanders, Injured by a war In which we firit bound to abstain from Interference. Wo shall never arrlvo at the restoration of friendehlp if we begin In a spirit of pettifogging attorneys. American writers and statesmen may re member with advantage onr blood Is, after all, not very different from their own. Englishmen have susceptibilities as well as Americans. It Is not Improbable that we , shall bo drawn towards America by tho suggestion that we are Insincere and bent on hoodwinking thoe with whom wo profess to be dealing openly.
