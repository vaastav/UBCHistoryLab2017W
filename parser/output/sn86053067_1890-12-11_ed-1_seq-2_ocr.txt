CAMDEN^S. C., DEcTn. 1890. ? - - * -s ? t< (JOVilRNOK TILLMAN'S INYIUIRAL ADDRESS. s T.efore an audience of four thousand pco- s pie on the 4th instant 15. R. Tillman was ' inaugurated Governor of South Carolina, 1 and delivered his inaugural address. It is ' t a paper replete with research, clearness of comprehension, and forcible suggestion.? ( Bold, and yet just, it is tree from mere carping criticism, and his bitterest oppon- , ent will fail to find in it the acrimony which characterized many of his utterances during 1 the campaign. Impressed with the magnitude of the re sponsibility resting upon him, he ilevoics himself to the subjects under consideration Kith an evident desire to be fair and at the same time correct, and seeks to probe to the bottom. Some of his suggestions may not be practicable, but they are well put, and he courts discussion, and difference if need be. on the part of the Legislature, assuring them that he has no piidc of opinion. Jlis add:ess is an agreeable surprise iu its tone, and barring a tinge now and theu of egotism, is a State paper of great force and ability. There is no clap-trap or stump orator style about it, but the dignitied re pose and keen analysis of the student and logician. He has devoted his time since the election to a study of the condition and needs of the State, and boldly asserts his views and calmly gives a reason for every change suggested. It is the most tlaborate inaugural delivered since 1876, and stamps him as a man of very decided ability, and we trust presages a conservative and progressive administration. It should be read by every citizen of '1 A 1 ~ ?III KavafnM nnlv mnke IOC iMHIL* HIJU WO win m^aiu.v...., a rutining comment on its details. Ilis declaration 011 the negro question and denunciation of lynch law will go far towards assuring them of his intention to do them justice and protect their rights. We are not familiar enough with the school problem to appreciate his plaD as to having square school districts, but one familiar with the scheme with whom we have couversed, regards it r. good one. His opinion of the necessity of a College for the women of the State, and tribute to and recommendations as to the Winthrop training school, are eminently 'proper and forcible. His views on the modes of assessing and equalizing taxes, are well conceived and expressed, and if a wholesome change em be effected much good will be accomplished, for a change is certainly needed. He appreciates the necessity of sustaining the credit of the State, aud while his views may le rather chimerical as to reducing taxes by increasing phosphate royalty and pledging the income from this source as security for the delt, yet they are worthy of consideration, and if practicable would been reformers, but Democrats and competent, is patriotic and an olive branch to heal differences in the party, and we trust his advice will bo heeded. Much good will ensue tbereform. .. THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. On the first instaut Benjamin Harrison, by I Divine permission and Republican money President of these United States, presented his annual message to Congress as required by the Constitution, and wc have scanned it most carefully to find ? single redeeming virtue, forcible ideu 01 patriotic impulse in it, and have failed. It is in keeping with the brain and heart of its author, and stamps him as lacking in the former and devoid of the latter. It has not the virtue even of meaningless generalities or platitudes which arc so often the refuge^of weakness, but makes up in vemom what it laoks in force. He might well be t% pAr\nK!!/ion P/MIVJ?An fnu Kn lnnmic ! I CI 

IUCU a AiC^uviivau tvi MV IVU < lie nothing, forgets nothing, nnd is as blind &s a bat and obstinate as a mule. The recent elections have neither taught l.iia a le-son nor enforced a morul. Wedded to fixedness Jof purpose, and that purpose to maintain Republican rule by means of monopolistic contributions, he waddles along regardless of consequences, and in common with the leaders ot the paity, with the exception of Blaine, is so befogged by jariisanry and sectional hate that he will not see the handwriting on4tbe wall or take eii to tin- popui.ir verdict. With the per {_ naciiy of it drowning mau he clings to the 1 arid" and the Lodge Bill, at.d neither re- t :iuls, regrets nor acknowledges the error I r unwisdom in favoring tho one and at- t suipting to force the other. t lie says the liinlf Kill lias not had a fair . howing and that il is too early yet to fore- 1 ee its consoqiierccs. If the ugiavution it las eausid and loss entailed grow in proper- 1 ion to Mill further enlightenment the 1 miple will receive as time progresses, and .heir anger and contempt Continue to in Mease, the cyclone of the -4th of November ivill be by 11>9-2 but n gent !e breeze. And yet ie and his parly seem oblivious to the warning and lesson of tie* late elections, and arc Apparently ucu-rnmicu iu uj;m n, ??i v.. tliis iino, even down to the last ditch of political des'ruction. lie seems to contemplate with satisfaction that this Bill "will be the quicken in? and enlargement of our manufacturing industries," but has not a word for the downtrodden and oppressed wage-earner and consumer, and with the falsity and folly of all high protectionists, has the impudence to say it will give "more constant employment and better wages for our working people," when a cut of wages and shutting down "f mills has been taking place, lie deprecates any futlher tinkering with the Tariff, and says "there is neither wisdom nor justice in the suggestion that the subject ol Tuiiff revision shall be aguiu opened." Oh! no. It suits the gentry out of whom Quay and Dudley "fry the fut," and there.'ore it should stand. A Democratic Congress will take issue with inv I.ord who speaks so patronizingly of "our people" as though he and his imps owned or carried them in their pockets, and endeavor to bring relief to them. lie urges tho passage of subsidies in the interest of the monopolists, Hnd it matters not whether such legislation inr-ronses I lie burden of the people. And then, as a sop to those who are kicking against the Tariff, he advocates the reciprocity tr? aty fad, I which is un acknowledgement that the Tariff is restricting the business of the country and is a curse. lie is very urgent in his advocacy of the Foice llill, and urges Congress to pass it, and in the face of the quiet, free and un * * * <i.A be a relief. IIis increase of the poll tax for school purposes, and raising the phosphate royalty, are uot measures of reduction, but are certainly on the line, as he expresses it, "that niggardness is often false economy." His resume of the condition of the Asylum and the Penitentiary, and suggestions us to remedying certain defects in both institutions, are r.ot altogether uovel, yet are on their face just aud proper. IJis onslaught on the Coosaw Phosphate Mining Company is justified by the mariner in whkh it acquired its rights originally, and under the opinion of Attorney Gener. 1 J 1* Ja ais connor, r.arie aim ru|? it is nw?m> u? an effort to test the question as to whether it has a lease which expires next March or vested rights in perpetuo. lie speaks in no uncertain souud on this and every question he touches, aud perspicuity marks Lis every utterance. He is outspoken in advocating an appropriation for the Citadel, and equally plain in suggesting that the University he reduced to a classical and literary institution, as the Cletnson College, which is a pet measure with the farmers, can be utilized for all scientific and practical purposes.? In regard to abolishing the University system much can be said pro and con, and the Legislature ought to give tho matter gruve consideration. TheClemson College is in a fair way to become a success, and if it can be made so, will prove a beneficence to the State. UWe agree with him in regard to the necessity for a constitutional convention. The address rises above any suspicion of demagogisi.v, aud is pitched on a high plane. It is thoughtful, able, and earnest, and does Governor Tillman great credit. We commend it to the thoughtful attention of our people. Ollice, &s a rule, promotes conservatism, and the expressions of the Governor in recommending the Legislature to select for office not men only w ho have ODSirucieu recenr elections m nic nuum, which completely refute the necessity for such a law, says "the nood of sucli a law lias'manifested itself in many parts of the couniry. and its wholosorae restraints and penalities will he useful in all." This means chicaner)', deviltry and expenso, and is the surest evidence of the moribund condition of his paily. Hut wc arc not yet convinced that the Senate will respond to his suggestion. And if it does the House Hill will be so amended as to disappoint Harrison. ltted and Hoar in their venomous purposes. Of course he is strong on the pension grabs and steals, and to fix the soldier vote hesitates not to recommend any amount of Treasury depletion. The financial blood can flow in huge streams, and devil take the tax payer so long as it secures the Grand Army. The business uieu and tax payers are getting heartily sick of this political clap-trap, and are determined to call a halt some where. Worthy soldiers and their widows should be pensioned, but not every deseiter, bumcierand bounty jumper. The fact is the attorneys are stirring up the matter, and such fellows as Tanner are .

The message has one virtue?it is comparatively brief and devoid of rhetoric; but, like i:s author, is as a whole, a bobtail, unsatisfactory, weak production, and reflects no credit on him. It is unpleasant to harshly criticise the Chief Magistrate of a great country, but a smaller, weaker ruan never occupied the ['residency, lie has personal hon slv. and hus never been accused of j ersonal dirty conduct, but as a Statesman and ofllcial he is small-souled, partisan and pig-headed. Governor Tillman's luaugural.

Tillman of Edgefield. No day perhaps ever dawned in ^oulli Curolina in whicli more was expected or fraught with greater interest. to t!ie people of this commonwealth, and the result was in many instances the surprises Hint were anticipated. At 1 :10 the band played an intcrcsting selection, and through the open doorway came the Sergeautsat Arms of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the former bearing the sword of St?to and the latter the mace. Following them was Lieutenant-Governor Mauldin and Speaker Irby and the membe s of the Senate and the House, and the members of the press.

The appearance of the procession was a signal for uproarious cheering, which was only quieted at the end of several moments. Then came a wait of about fifteen minutes, and suddenly the Sergeantat-Arms of the House appeared and announced "His Kxellenev the Governor elect and his escort." Speaker Irby replied : "Admit His Exec leney the Governor and his escort."

The invocation was received by all with the greatest respect, an i at its completion Speaker irhy announced that lion. Benjara n ltyan Tillman was present and ready to qualify.

Increase in the Internal Revenue Receipts?The Public Debt Increased. Washington, Nov. 29.?The collections of the internal revenue during the first four months of the current fiscal year aggregate $51,02 V 289, being an increase of $4,2-15,290 over the collections during the corresponding period of list year. There was an increase of 81,653.477 on spirits, $1,193 filGon tobacco, and $1,301,550 on fermented liqti rs. It is estimated at the Treasury De pat tment that tho public debt, loss the cash in the Treasury, has been increased about $1,000.01)0 since the fi.st instant, due principally to the heavy payments during the month.
