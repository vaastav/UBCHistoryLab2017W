KELSEY MUM ON RESIGNATION RUMOR. Insurance Superintendent Says He Believes Public Is Not Interested. Otto TCelsey.

It was suggested to Mr. Kelsey that ' v » public misht be interested, and he replied: "I gue.ss the public would not be much Inter ested." Coupled with the rumors regarding the possible retirement of Mr K>lsey are others mentioning the names cf men as his successor. Some of these are S<;n3tor TV. W. Armstrong, who was chairman of the legislative committee that investigated tue. insurance situation a few years ago: S. Herbert Wolfe insurance actuary, who was prevented by an automobile accident from aiding Charles E. Hu-hes in the investigation, and Matthew C.

Dispatches from BeldJn*. Mich., announce that the new mill of Beldlng 1 Brothers & Co., manu facturers of Bilk products, will be completed and ready for operation about the first of th« year. This may be Bet down as another indication, of the approach of the predicted wive of prosperity which promises to relegate to oblivion the recent financial depression. The new mill will be devoted to" the manufacture of silk fabrics, and will em ploy about seven hundred bands, capable of pro ducing fully two million yards annually. The building la of the most approved construction, and calculated to provide •-.--■• conditions otrainable for the operatives. The latest machinery used In silk manufacture will be used. In this connection it is interesting to trace the development of Beld \v.z Brothers & Co. from a comparatively humble beginning In 1564 to its present magnitude. The foundation of the firm was really laid In IS6O, when th« late Hiram H. Beiriing- and his brother, Alvah N. Belding, left their home In Sliding. i'ich., -.-, sell silk from house to house Their sup ply was obtained from another brother, Kilo M. BeMlng, then living at the birthplace of th* Beld ing!?. Ashfield, Mass. T*!s business was so profit able that the Belding brothers were ab> to «m bark in the manufacture of Bilk at kv*>. Conn.. In 1866, and the. original factory, with lar^-e. addi tions, now employing some five hundred hands, is still running to Its fullest capacity in the manu facture of silk thread of every description. In IST2. by reason of the Increased demand for their product, the Beldings were able to build an addi tional mill st Northampton. Mass. This mill now employs seven hundred hands In the manufacture of embroidery Bilk and various forms of silk fab rics. A third factory was built in Beldin* Mich., in 1890: another in Petaluma, Cal.. and still an other in Montreal, Canada. The continued demand required the building of a second factory In Beld ing, which went Into commission about two years ago. manufacturing fabrics only, and now the third factory at Beiding is about ready to begin opera tions. It may not be generally known that America is the greatest producer and consumer of silk prod ucts in the world, but It is a matter of record that the mills of this country work up about eighteen million pounds of raw Filk annually, or about one third of the world's product. Of this anwint, it la said. Belding Brothers & Co. are generally consid ered by the trade to be the 'arrest single consumers. To understand what a herculean task the little silk worm baa to perform to supply this great <i»man<i fur silk, it will be interesting to observe how raw silk is produced. An ounce of siikworm '-ggs will number about forty thousand. When hatched the worms from an ounce of eggs, working about thirty days, will same three-quarters; of a ton of mulberry leaves, after which they s .in their cocoons and go Into the chrysalis state. The weight of these forty thousand Bilk cocoons varies from SO to 120 pounds, and the length of the thread In each is about three hundred yards. As it takes "Jf) cocoon threads to make one thread of commer- Ciai eilk. one can appreciate what a very little part even forty thousand silkworms play in the manu facturing process, and what a great amount of labor la required to produce silk threads and fab rics from the raw material. The process is a suc cession of unwinding, spinning, twisting and re winding ■with numerous washings, dyeings and finishings, before the thread can be sr.rc.led and offered for 6a!e.
