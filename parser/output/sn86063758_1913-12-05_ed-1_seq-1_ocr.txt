WX1SUI1 luuat laiu wiviv, legislative ambition of the democra- \ tie administration. . For nearly 28 minutes the president! stood before the assembled senate and hQuse in toe chamber of the latter and read his first annual message. Applause punctuated important utter- j [ ances, and when he had finished there was an enthusiastic demonstration, with hand clapping and cheers. Briefly, the .president outlined a program for social justice and the general welfare of the nation, and proclaimed the aspirations of the United States for international amity and the maintenance of constitutional government in all America. With close almost eager attention, f members of the two houses listened and time and again the legislators gave vent to their enthusiasm along i with the crowded galleries. A Remarkable Paper. F Less than 3,000 words long, the message was one of the briefest and mo^t novel of American State papers ?a marked contrast, as presented by Its author today, to the hitherto k lengthy documents averaging 20,000 A words or more, droned through by a reading clerk to an inattentive conBf gress. I There was another contrast con1 spicuously apparent. I President Wilson had read three messages before?on the tariff, the currency and Mexican affairs. The first time He aaaressea a jomt ssea- , sion in person, early in this term, I *>bere was an atmosphere of stiff formality, applause was liberal, but perfunctory, and there was an indev finable air of precedent being broken [ ?or a century-old custom being reI vived. There was an expecting cur iosty as to how the president would | be received. Today the president s reception was warm, almost uproarious, as he concluded his reading. Praise From Both Sides. Later, republicans and democrats I alike pronounced the message as the utterance of a statesman. "I like the idea of the "resident I coming before congress," said RepreW sentative Mann, republican house feaaer, "ana reaaing a suun imjssasc,; pithy and to tae point In the main I liked the message today. I think j everybody will recognize it as the utterance of a statesman, regardless or whether he agrees with its details." L Of particularly significance was one l| outburst regarded in the national capp ital today?the unmistakable approval F xhat greeted the president's remark: I "There can be no certain prospect IOf peace in America until Gen. Huer-1 la has surrendered his usurped au- j thoriity in Mexico." Among those who would discuss the message in congress there was a general endorsement of the adminis- i tration's policy toward Mexico. Heard by Packed House. The scene of today's function was ? ? ^ V\ /V 

|VM*AA I Iw muca tne same as uu uie tmcc incu- ] I ous occasions, when President Wilson j i has addressed congress?galleries crowded with men and women of importance in public affairs, members of the cabinet, the diplomatic corps and the White House family. Democratic leaders were enthusias- I tic in their comments on the message j f and its recommendations. They liked k the emphasis placed by the president , on the need for early action on the currency, ior aeaxing wuu uwuuiwi.- i f through anti-trust legislation, the importance of rural credit legislation to benefit the farmers, the recommendaL tions for government construction of | ^ railroads in Alaska, the development | P of tiie nation's resources by a conser- 1 I vation policy alike acceptable to the I State and the federal authorities, the ? ^? nf QTnnlnvorc' liahilifv jjegislatlon and the selection and the Selection of presidential candidates by H^e primary system. jgf 3Teet With Approval. The. suggestion of the president that mm party conventions as at present con stituted be abolished won much applause. As Mr. Wilson declared that the party convention should be held only to ratify the verdict of preferential primaries, that the personnel of the conventions should be, for the most part, chosen from those members of congress and congressional nominees upon whom would devolve the duty of carrying out platform pledges, there was a wave of handclapping, in which Secret-iry Bryan and members of the cabinet joined. "It was a fine, statesmanlike speech," said Speaker Clark afterwards, "covering points that I have been agicating for years, particularly presidential primaries." "I think," said Representative Oscar W. Underwood, "the presidents message was the address of a broad statesman, covering the scope of tr.e necessary legislative action of this session of congress. It was in accord with the principles and policies of our party as declared at Baltimore, and I have no doubc it will meet with favor able action oy tne nouse 01 representatives." Start Already Made. For nearly all of the legislation outlined in the message, t'.ie ground work has been laid, and the president plans to speak further to congress with relation to anti-trust reforms. Alaskan railroad legislation now is before both houses, a Workman's Compensation act has been favorably considered in each house, and bills on the otfh-er important subjects are in a position to receive immediate attention. The declaration for legislation 10 provide for primary elections for presidential nominees, without the intervention of nomination conventions, bore immediate fruit in the house. Representative Rucker, of Missouri, chairman of the house committee on privileges and elections, tonignt Degan framing a bill to cover all tee president's suggestions. He will immediately introduce it with a view to getting action by his committee before the Christmas holidays, if possible. Interest in this recommendation was manifested in both houses. Several bills of this character have been introduced in the senate and advocated on the floor by republicans and progressives. Church of the Redeemer. (Rev. Edward Fulenwider, pastor.)

Clemson Notes. 1 Clemson Colege, Dec. 3.?Last | Thursday being Thanksgiving, we ! had a holiday. Several of tke cadets j went home to spend the day, and about | two hundred went to Atlanta to see ithe Clemson-Tech football game. The [ / ] game was rather disappointing to the ! Pipmsnn students and suDDorters, but | we ijiust take into consideration that j we can't win all the games in one year. iThe football season closed last Thursday as that was the last intercollegiate game to be played this year by the Tigers. As a whole, t'.he season has been rather prosperous for the Tiger, and we hope to make it touch more prosperous next year. Class football will begin in a few days, and the men on the varsity squad win De uie coaches for .'he different class teams. Basket ball practice will also begin in the near future with Coach Major in charge of the team. At present, the conditions look very favorable for a good basket ball team, howfever, one of our very best players graduated last .year and ws will miss him very much.
