FOLLOWING is the message of President Wilson delivered at a joint session of the senate ami j house at tlie beginning of the j Sixty-fourth congress: Gentlemen of the Congress?Since I last had the privilege of addressing! you on the state of the Union the war of nations on the other side of the sea. which had then only begun to disclose its portentous proportions, has extended its threatening and sinister ^copo until it has swept within its flame sonie portion of every quarter of the globe, nut excepting our own hemisphere, has altered the whole face of j international affairs, and now presents | r~. o m-rtcnwt ?f ro>n > i7.n ri on .qnrl re construction such as statesmen and peoples have never been called upou i to attempt before. The president tells how this country) practiced neutrality and declares that he hopes that when the time comes for readjustment and recuperation this country will be of infinite service. Referring to Central and South American problems, the president declares that we should retain unabated the spirit which has inspired us throughout the i whole life of our government and r which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. We have been put to the test in the case of Mexico, and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Her fortunes are in her own hands. Rut we have at least proved that we will not take advantage of her in ber distress and undertake to impose upon her an order and government of our own choosing. Liberty is often a tierce and intractable thing, to which no bounds can be set and to which no bounds of a few men's choosing oupht ever to be set. Every American who has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra[ dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Virginia bill of rights, which in the great days In which our government was set up was everywhere among us accepted as the creed of free men. That doctrine is, "That government Is or ought to be instituted for the common benefit, protection and security of the people, nation or community;" that "of all the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is -capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is | most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, and that when any government shall be found I inadequate or contrary to these pur poses a majority of the community nn In/liihito Mo 4 n ?lionn hi Jinri Llaili UU lUUUL/HUMiW, 

4MMMVUMVV indefeasible right to reform, alter or -abolish it in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal." We have unhesitatingly applied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic. I which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any I outside quarter in the radical but nec- j essary process. We will aid and befriend Mexico, but we will not coerce her. and our course with regard to her! - ? ?~ ^' f A oil A TYIfif. -UUgUl IU UL" BUUlUCUk J/IW4 ?.v ? uuv ica that we seek do political suzerainty or selfish control. I PAN-AMERICANISM HAS NONE OF EMPIRE'S SPIRIT. Economio Adjustments Inevitable Within tha Next Generation, The moral is that the states of America are not hostile rivals, but co-operating friends, and that their grow-, ing sense of community of interest, alike in natters political and In matters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors in international affairs and in the political his tory of the world. It presents them as In a very deep and true sense a unit In world affairs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking together, quick with common sympathies JJ.-i- ? ^ ana common laeais. wynittieu, mev j f are subject to all the cross currents of |^the confused politics of a world of hostile rivalries; united in spirit and purpose, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. 1 WILSON'S V.- ... : Photo by American Press Association. PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST PICTURE. (From snapshot taken on Nov. 26.) This is pan-Americanism. It has none j of the spirit of empire in it It is the j j embodiment, the effectual embodiment, j of the spirit of law and independence j and liberty and mutual service. Tin-* r^Tv^crirJanf ^allc nttonffon tr> th<* ! I i meeting In Washington recently of I representatives of the pan-American ; republics and says that economic adi justment is inevitable in the next gen! eration. No one who really comprehends the | spirit of the great people for whom we ; are appointed to speak can fail to perI ceive that their passion is for peace, : their erenius best'displayed in the prac j tice of the arts of peace. Great democ| racies are not belligerent They do not ! R??ek or desire war. Their thought Is of individual liberty and of the free { labor that supports life and the udcensored thought that quickens it.: Conquest and dominion are not in our reckoning or agreeable to our principles. But just because we demand un-, molested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter it may come, the aggression we ' ourselves will not practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self i chosen lines of national development We do more tban that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there Is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on this side the sea and have deemed it as important that our neighbors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should 1 ' ? ~ J ,7 ? ue, nave set Aixicinja asiue us a ?ut?c for the uses of independent nations and political freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a means of asserting the rights of a people against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dictatorial power within our own nation ! as of aggression from without We will not maintain a standing army except for uses which are as necessary in times of peace as in times of war. 

SUGGESTS BROAD PLAN FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. Increase Standing Regular Force?Four i Hundred Thousand Citizen Soldiem. i But war has never been a mere matter of men and guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizcns are ever to fight effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know how modern fighting is done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately available and immediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training they need to take care of | themselves and of it The military ! arm of their government, which they : will not allow to direct them, they may I prdperly use to serve them and make i their independence secure, and not J their own independence merely, but i file rights also of those with whom ! MESSAGE Declares That if Full Navy Program Is Carried Out We Will Have a Fleet For Defense That Will Be "Fitted to Our Needs and Worthy of Our Traditions." Greatest Danger to Country ? n Comes i-rom Witnin uur BCi-1 ders. I they hare made common cause, should | they also be put In jeopardy. They must be fitted to play the great role in the world, and particularly in this hemisphere, for which they are qualified by principie and by chastened am bition to play. It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequate national defense were >onceived which will be laid before you. and which I urge you to sanction | and put into effect as soon as they can be properly scrutinized and discussed They seem to me the essential first stens. and thor seem to me for the present sufficient They contemplate an increase of the j standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5.023 officers and 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.136 officers j and 134.707 enlisted men, or 141.843 ail told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en-! gineers, ten regiments of Infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero squadrons, besides 750 officers required for a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of training the citizen force of ; which I shall presently speak, 792 noncommissioned officers for service in ji -it* Ui j urill. recrujimg auu me ime aim iuc necessary quota of enlisted men for the quartermaster corps, the hospital corps, the ordnance department and other similar auxiliary services. These are the additions necessary to render j the army adequate for its present duties. duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and borders and at our interior army posts, but also in the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isthmiis nnd in Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready 1 to assert some part of its real power j promptly and upon a larger scale ! should occasion arise the plan also ! contemplates supplementing the army j by a force of 400,000 disciplined citi- : zens, raised In increments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three ' years. This it is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the ! serviceable men of the country would j , be asked to bind themselves to serve j "* '1? ?' n# train. I Wltn 1116 colors xui ^uij^voco iiuiu l ! ing for short periods throughout three j years and to come to the colors at call j at any time throughout an additional j "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400.000 men would be provided with personal accouterments f*s fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied at any time. They would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at i convenient places in association with suitable units of the regular army, j Their period of annual training would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it Is up to the patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call. 

COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR GREATER NAVY. Always Looked to It as Our First and Chief Line of Defense. The program which will be laid before you by the secretary of the navy Is similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out, but It does make definite and explicit a Drosram which has heretofore been only implicit, held in the minds of the committees on naval affairs and disclosed in the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or formally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion within the next five years. We have always looked to the navy of the country as our first and Una r\f rJof*>nsp: wp have always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high indeed among the navies of the maritime nations. We should, now definitely de termlne how we shall complete what we have begun and how soon. The program to be laid before you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty destroyers. fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gunrmo hnsnitfll shin two ammuni U/VtttOf vuv . - - - - tion ships,.two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats and one hospital ship: the second year two liattleships, one scout cruiser, j destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat I and one fuel oil ship; the third year I two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma* " ^ - nnes; uie rourm year uvo uaiueMuiia, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammunition ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers. two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship and one repair ship. The secretary of the navy is asking also for the immediate addition to the . personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors. 2.500 apprentice seamen and 1.500 marines. This increase would be suHeient to eare for the ships which are ro be completed within the fiscal year 1017 and also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships which will be completed early in 101S. It is also necessary that the number of midshipmen at the Naval academv at Annapolis should be increased by at least 300 In order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to. and authority is asked to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, and for service in the aviation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this fu?l program should be carried out we should have built or building in 1921. according to the estimates of survival and standards of classification followed by the general board of the department, an effective navy consisting of 27 battleships of the first line, 0 i * ? I ? ? A.U^ battle cruisers, ^.> oauiesmps ui iuc second line. 10 armored cruisers. 13 scout cruisers. 5 first class cruisers. 3 second class cruisers. 10 third class . cruisers. 10S destroyers. 18 tieet submarines, 157 coast submarines. (> mon- ' itors, 20 gun'ioats. 4 supply ships, 15 fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to 1 torpedo vessels, 8 vessels of special types and two ammunition ships, This 1 would be a navy fitted tu our needs j and worthy of our traditions. But armies and instruments of war ' are only part of what has to be c n- j sidered if we are to consider the supreme matter of national self niflieien- j cy and security in all its aspects. There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention \ whether we will or not- There is, for example, a very pressing question of ! trade and shipping involved in this great problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a great r merchant marine. The great merchant j fleet we once used to make us rich, j that great body of sturdy sailors who 1 used to carry our nag into ever,) ?en, and wlio were the pride aud often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hopelessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It Is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our commercial independence , on the seas. VTitb a view {o meeting thes^e press f ing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present unparalleled opportunity of linking the two Americas together in bonds of mutual inter est and service, an opportunity which j may never return again if we miss it j now, proposals will be made to the! present congress for the purchase or J construction of ships to be owned and j directed by the government similar to i those made to the last congress, but j modified in some essential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you j for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month | that has elapsed since the former proposals were made has made the ne- ' cessity for such action more and more manifestly imperative. That need was then foreseen. It is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. 1 am not so much interested in the particulars of the program a3 I am in taking immediate advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us if we will but act in this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of j common counsel should prevail, and i out of it should come an early solution of this pressing problem.
