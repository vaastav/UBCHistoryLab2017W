Washington standard! OFFICIAL PAPER OF THURSTON COUNTY OLYMPIA. WAf4H IX44TON TKK. OLYIPIA. FRIDAY EVENING, DEC.JJSS^ "Piety iu Rags" Under this caption the San Fran cisco Examiner of the 3d inetant pub lished an article which created a sen sation. The question having arisen whether the gospel was practically as free to every living creature as in theo ry and song, a reporter of that journal was detailed to make a practical test of the matter by disguising himself as nearly as jioesible to represent a man who had seen better days and visiting the fashionable churches during regu lar service. The result is given in three columns detailing his experience j at the several churches. 111 not one single instance was he received with that fraternal love which the Christ life teaches. 111 no one of the gilded palaces dedicated to the modern god Mammon—did he find any recognition of those time-honored principles which actuated the patriarchs of old, and which take the strongest hold upon the hearts of those who love and rev erance the Bible; but on the contrary his apjiearance was greeted by the swift glance of contempt, the curling lip of scorn and muttered expressions of amazement at his presumption in entering the sacred shrine in tattered clothes. Even the ushers were inso lent iu their behavior, and reluctantly gave him a hack seat or sent him up into the gallery witli the unswerving dignity that a couiluctor on a mixed train sends the second-class passengers to the forward coach or the smoking car. The Examiner't publication had an immediate good effect, for in the suc ceeding issue appear the views of sev eral of the pastors of the churches vis ited, and they deplore the existence of the bigotry which lias drifted the Christian church so far from its moor- j ings. If the true spirit exists in these ; congregations, they will, of course, be greatly benefitted by this awakening to a sense of duty, but to those who make ostensible worship of Diety a means for display and the gratification of human vanity, it will be regarded simply as an audacious interference with personal privileges and pass un heeded. The lesson taught our metropolitan neighbors should not be lost in churches of smaller places and sparser congregations. If the same besetting sin is not so marked as to he appre ciable here, there are many lesser ones which a close study of the life of the jfazarine will enable us to discover. Humility is a Christian virtue that seems to be almost wanting in some congregations and charity, that great est of all virtues in its broadest sense, is so rare at times as to excite the won der of those whose natures have not become calloused by creed. The Examiner's articles are com mended to the church people as a true remedy for that pride which destroys the Christian nature. It may be a .bitter draught, but it will doubtless act irilh precision, and finallj as a seda tive, to restore the church to its former purity and usefulness. Arm every Presidential electiou there is a class of people who predict the total ruin and disbandment of the beaten party. Nothing can be more ridiculous. In 1872 the Democratic party was considered beyond all hope and yet it carried the election in 1876. Hancock's defeat was said to involve the rain of the party, but it swept Cleveland into die White House four yean later. The Democracy will take the field again in 1882 with renewed confidence and with as mqcli assur ance d success as ever. -a- As Mr.'E. B. Hyde of Spokane Falls voted for Mr. Harrison in the Chi cago Convention " first, last and all the time," he will probably be a match for Tom Cavanaugli in the distri bution of the spoils, notwithstand ing tip latter gertleman is 4 g* member of the National Committee, There will be fun enough when the curtain rises, for spectators, notwith standing the entertainment will par take somewhat of the nature of a pack of wolves fighting over carrion. THK more important portions of the President's Message to Congress are given in the form of a supplement to the 

STANDARD this week. It will be rpad with interest by everybody, as em anating from one who was defeated for a conscentious discharge of a duty he knew would be misunderstood and un popular. There is no indication of a change of opinion on the tariff ques tion, although his last appeal is likely to fall upon unwilling ears. Owno to reports that Chinese are now finding their way into the United States through British Colombia and Mexico, a new bill or resolution looking to some joint agreement between the governments of Great Britain and the United States and Mexico to prohibit the landing of Chinese immigrants is expected to be reported st the present session of Congress. Ws are now being treated to dreary discussions of the future of the Demo cratic party. This is adding insult to injury. The future of the party is assured; it will always live. In fact, it is the only party in this country that has demonstrated its ability to <wi«t a quarter of a century out of power. Two men ciugbt 19,000 pounds of sturgeon in the Columbia river, near Bainier, in less thirty days, for which they received two cents a pound. _ THK latest count in West Virginia that Alderton (Dem.) for Con gress, and Fleming (Dem.) for Gover nor are elected by a small majority.

A GOOD MOVE. —In view of the fact that individual sovereignty necessarily implies that the majority shall rule, Representative Stone of Kentucky to day introduced a joint resolution pro posing an amendment to the Constitu. tion, providing that the President and Vice-President shall be chosen every iourth year by direct votes of the peo ple. One section of the bill forbids the holding of any local or State elec tions, except for members of Congress, on the day set apart lor the election of President and Vice-President. Had this Democratic principle prevailed when the Constitution was framed, President Cleveland would to-day be President elect, by a decided majority of the ten millions of voters. In a late interview with twenty] prominent representative men of both parties, in this city, to ascertain their preference for the Pacific Coast mem ber of Mr. Harrison's cabinet, should that worthy concede its claims, six were for Geo. H. Williams, of Oregon, five for Senator Dolph, of the same State, three for ex-Governor Squire, of this Territory, two for W. W. Morrow, of California, one for Senator Jones of Nevada, one for Estee of California, one for Swift of California, and the twentieth man didn't want any Pacific coaster appointed and especially not Jl. H. DeYoung, of California. 

JODGE Langford decided at Walla Walla last Tuesday that a railroad company is not liable for damages re sulting to stock because the company had not fenced its track; that under common law the owners of cattle must keep them off the premises of others. In short, that the owner of real estate, even of a railroad company, is not bound to fence against the depreda tions of cattle, in the absence of a spe cial statute. This is a very important ruling, and under it, if sustained, rail roads need not fence their tracks. The case will be appealed to the Su. preme Court. THE Philadelphia and Reading Rail road Company have notified their em ployes of a reduction of time and wages, owing to a suspension of the coal mines, and the same condition applies to all persons connected with the coal traffic. Verily it seems the millenium's dawn has not yet illu mined the horizon, notwithstanding the promises that a Republican victory at the polls held so seductively to mady ears. A LETTER from Secretary Bayard to the owners of the steamer Haytian Be public, which is held by the Haytians as a prize, having been condemned for running the blockade, has been made public. The Secretary declares the seizure illegal and states that an American man-of-war will be sent to Port au Prince to demand the steam er's release. THE German bark C. B. Bishop, which left San Francisco on the 29th ult, with a cargo of wheat for Queens town, returned to that port after she had proceeded 200 miles on her way, with fire in her hold. At last accounts the fire was still burning and threatens total destruction to the ship. MRS James G. Blaine, Jr., has de cided to become an actress. She also contemplates a suit for damages against the Blaine family, for alienat ing the affections of her husband. A COLLISION between a freight and construction train, at Cocolla, I. T., on the 4th, resulted in a general wreck, in which a brakeman was killed and a fireman fatally injured. A SAN FRANCISCO dispatch of the 4th says that the steamer Wilmington has been placed in quarantine, having on board a case of smallpox from Se attle. MR. J. C. Haines has been acquitted of the charge of conspiracy with the opium smugglers in the trial in New York. CHIEF Justice Boyle has appointed his son Edward O. Boyle, Deputy Clerk of the District Court at Seattle. THE Secretary of War has directed that the army shall hereafter devote part of each summer to active drill.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.—The follow ing are the Congressional expressions of Cleveland's message: Springer, Democrat, Illinois, said: "It is as strong on the tariff question as the last one, though not so explicit. It is a good paper." Congressman Reed, Republican, of Maine: "A year has bought about a great change. Then it was a condi tion thai confronted us, and not a theory, and now, apparently, it is a theory and not a condition." Senator Ingalls, Republican, of Kan sas, said: " President Cleveland's im perturbility is entirely to perfect to be the result of self control." Congressman Boutelle, Republican, of Maine, said: "It is the old straw thrashed again. The message is weary, stale and flat, and unprofitable." Senator Gorman, Democrat, of Maryland : "It is a very interesting, statesmanlike document." Congressman Foran, Democrat, of Ohio: " The President has consented to let wool alone this time. If he had been so discreet before, the Republi cans would not have had the next President and the next House." The Oyster Rebellion. 

MARYLAND WILL SEEK HELP FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR. BALTIMORE, Nov. 17.—Governor Jackson, in an interview to-day, said the situation of the oyster rebellion, which confronts the State authorities in this: " There arc 800 oyster vessels whose crews, aggregating about 5,000 armed men, are banded together to dredge on certain grounds and to drive off any State force sent against them. To oppose them the State has fourteen vessels, most of them small sloops, manned by about 100 men. We have reached a stage where this force cannot cope with the marauders, and I shall adopt measures for the en forcement of the law. I have reason to believe that the Secretary of War at Washington will grant us the use of five, six or eight-pound cannons, which will be placed on the State steamers and at spots on shore to be selected hereafter." TAKE IT IN TIME. " For want of a nail, a shoe was lost; i for want of a shoe, a horse was lost: for want of a horse, a rider was lost." Never neglect small things.

There were two tickets in the field, the citizens' and prolii , bition. The election was held last Monday and the citizens' ticket elect ; ed, but it seems it was not quite legal and will terminate in another election, j Centralia lias tried prohibition before and found it did not improve the town much, and we are in hopes the citizens' ticket will again be chosen.
