Twenty mlnutea after Itanuah had tak en her departure from the detective' of- Hellara entered the door of the Caro lina Hotel. ' It waa Hearing eleven o'clock, and he found but two men present iu the ollice Mclnlii, the night clerk of the hotel, aud Dolby drowning,; on of the conductor of the Wlliningion mid Weldon Itallroad. The detective prntaed through the office Into the barroom, whera he purchaacd a clgnr, lighted it ami auntered back Into the office, - "(lood evening, gentlemen," be remark ed, aa he at rode forward to the counter on which (he register w lying. "Good evening, Mr. Hcllara," responded (he two men. , "Not niueh transient rutom nowadaya, I (iipiMiae, Mack?" "Very little," replied the clerk, "nor do I aupposo we can look for mors before fall." . "1 ahould Judge not," ald Sellara, a he bent over the open register. "One, two. Hve, aeven, nine. Why, you had fifteen arrlvnl to-day." "Yea, hut half of them are drummera," said the clerk; "they get half rate, you knowN There la not much money in them." "Well they will bring you other cuatom la'er." "True enough, Mr. Rcllara; that I the Inducement for giving them half rate." "Yesterday you had even a greater num ber, twenty-four. I declare, I ee few name here that I have not aohie knowl edge of the parties." Here the detective turned bark a leaf of the register. , "The 17lh, twenty-one guests. Ah, here I tl ame of my old friend. Jo Ansou of Tarboro. Why, here'a Nortiient of Lum borton and Caldwell of Duplin. Yes. and Hum Oriidy and Col. Hoyt of Charleston. Next cornea Hiepheim-O, A.

To be sure, there are plenty of Ktephenae Virginia, for Instance, la full of them; then there are the Stephensea of Cumber land, the Hiepheuae of Wake and Cra ven. I wonder If C. A. Htephena la one of those?" "I think not," said the clerk. "I liave no recollwtion of having seen thla Hte phena before. He wa only here a short lime. Arrived on the morning of the 17th and left oil the night of the INth. He may have been a drummer, but I think not, as he did int ask for druniuirr' rate and bad no baggage with him." "lie wa not a drummer then," aaid Hollars, with a laugh, "but he may have been an employer of drummer." , , "He made a trip down with me," ob served Hrownlng. "I hate no recollectiou of having seen him before. He I not n drummer, and If he left on the night of the lHth he must have goue out with Hor den. He had the night run that trip." "lie looked rather like a aimrting char acter," observed the clerk, "but I presume he waa a Italtiniore business man. Cra ven, the eashler of the "Cape Fear Hunk,' seemed to know him; at least 1 noticed them talking earnestly together on the night of the 17th. Uy the way, that waa a sad aftuir of Mr. Deltoaette' taking off." ' "Terrible, Mack! Terrible! It waa a ahock to the entire community." "And to think that Itohert Campbell should have committed the murder! Why, he la the last man I would hare suspected, and I heard Hherlft Cobb say there waa no doubt of hla guilt.',' "Sheriff Cobb 1 a very shrewd man a very shrewd man," said the detective. "1 understiiud that the prisoner had the udaclty to call you into the case. It re minded me of your call lu tho Mulberry case." . "Very like!. Very like!" said I.ang. "Cobb got the start of me this time." "I am aorry for Campbell's mother and sister," observed the night clerk.' "Yea, and .1," said I.ang. "Well, good night," he added, "1 hiust be going." "Hood uight,' Mr, Hellars." "So much for Mr. "(J. A. Stephens." thought I.ang aa he left the office. "He arrived lu Wilmington on the morning of tho 171 h.

It Is late, but the mother and daughter arc looking for me. I must drop in and give them a word of cheer.

CHAPTKH XII; AtHhb appointed time ou the night of the 20th Uncle Duke was admitted to the preaence ot the. detective, ltut the old man could give uo Information that Sel la deemed material. It was evident that he knew less of the cashler'a life, associa tions and career after banklug hours than did Adiini. lie occupied a room ou the lower Boor of the house back of the bath room, and usiiiillv was sound asleep by nine o'clock at night. . That had been the ease on the night of tiie niurder, and he knew nothing of the terrible deed that had been com mitted until he was aroused by the com motion that followed It. Ho hud never heard of a party by the name of C. A. Stephew, nor had he ever known Herman Craven to bring com- panlnn Into the bnnker'a house. Tho night following hla conversation With Uncle Duke the detective met Con ductor Ilorden at the Carolina Hotel and In a discussion which he brought about in. regard to the traffic of the road, he grad ually led 'round to the number of passen ger that the various conductors carried over the mud on their trips. In the mean while the hotel register was open before him. ', "The transfer from the Manchester road form the bulk of the pneseiiger list going north now," said the conductor, "but ou my Inst trip, the night or the INth I had a goodly number from Wilmington." "Yen," said Hellars, turning back the leave of the register. "I notice quite a number of arrivals on the 17th and lHth. It la ao hot here now that they do not tarry long. I suppose you cnrrlrd them all back up the rond with you. I ace that those that arrived on the I7th are nearly all checked as baring departed on the night of the 18th. 3o Wallace, and Hoyt, and Caldwell, and Turner, and Htephena. Hy the way, I wonder what family of Ste phens!' thla C. A. Stephens belongs to?"' "I declare' I don't know," aaid Borden. "He came down the road with Krownir.g, I believe. If he left the city on the night of the INth he did uot go over the road with me. He may have gone south. Grady aud, Hoyt went that way back to Charleston, I suppose." Theii&l of the month the remains of the banker were consigned to the grave, and a vaat concourse of people wa present In the cemetery when the last sad rites were spoken. All eyes were seemingly beut on the form of the bereaved young daughter, who, lu the anguish that wrung her heart, clung, strange to say, not to the arm of Herman Craven, who seemed to ahudder and grow pale aa the clods of earth rolled In upon the coffin, but to the anna of two women who were seemingly scarcely lesa agitated than herself the mother and sis ter of the man who Iny In Jail accused of the damnable crime of the banker's taking off. Many there were who looked on this scene with surprise, but none with a deep er feeling of annoyance than Herman Craven and Sheriff Cobb. , To Sheriff Cobb's cold nature It wa in explicable that the daughter of the mur dered man should seek consolation ot the mother and sister of his murderer. To Herman Craven' mind the circum stance boded not the ensy fulfillment of hla wishes. "Wait!" he thought. "Wait!" Iang Hellars. as he stood ome yards way, leaulng against a stately pine, hla tall form towering above all others, thought, as hla keen eye rested on the fig ure before hlra: "There will be a tie that will bind you yet closer together. Wait!" It was ten o'clock on the 2,'ld day of the month, and gathered in the spacious par lor of the residence of the late banker were the Ave directors of the "Cape Fear Hunk" and a goodly number of those who In his lifetime hnd been close personal friends. "'. ' Seated at oue side of the front parlor near an open window, aud with Jennie Campbell beside her, was the banker's daughter, and very beautiful, yet sad, she looked, clad in the habiliments that told of her bereavement. A number of ladles were seated near them, aud ranged against the wall oppo site them were the family servants. Herman Craven sat near a center table conversing with the old attorney of the bank, who presently arose to his feet. In a position from where he could at will scan all feature sat the great detective. .."I have la-en requested,", snid the law yer, "by the diiughter of our late friend, by hi nephew and by the directors of the bank of which be wu the honored presi dent,. ,to reail to those hewi present Jiis laift will and testament. The Instrument la embraced In this package of papers Just headed me by the cashier ot the bank, Herman Craven.", , , " Here Attorney pubbs removed the rub ber band and withdrew from the package the banker's will.

WHIP AGAINST SWORD. . How a I'iucVy Womnn Prevented Her Husband's Aasaaetautlon. The Civil aud Military Gaxette, inib llslied tit Alluhabad, contains an excit ing necomtt of the manner In which a plucky womnu atcd herself aud her Jiusbtiml against the'attuck of a Gluml. As Captain nndMrs. Hpence were out driving Hlowly they saw a Brnhul mounted ou a Hnhich racing mnre com ing toward them at a wulU. As the ninn approached he drew hla sword ami nuide a vigorous cut nt Ciuttiilu Hpence, whot on sccIdk tho naked sword, in stantly stood up and limbed at the Ghaxl with, the driving whip, causing the mart! to swerve arid the sword to pass harmlessly by, but uncomfortably close to Captnln Speneo's heiid. At tills Instant Captain Hpence lost his bnlnnce and foil nudor the wheel of the trap, where ho lay pinned down for some time. Seeing her husband In the act of falling, Mrs. Si'ence selr-ed tjhe whip from his hand! and Jumped to the ground.. By this time the Ghar.1 had wheeled ou tUe.road and wtti milking another rush. Mrs. Spenee Instantly stood between her husband and the man, and there received the Ghnzl's at tack, whip InTbnnd, cutting at hltu and hlB mare and calling out for help. By making vigorous use of her whip she kept the Ghaal off and drove him away. A second charge the Ghnr.1 made was slmllnrly repulsed, except that on this occasion the GhaKl's cuts eum more perilously nenr, and Mrs. Spenee wns knocked down., By this time Cnptalu Hpence hnd extricated himself from be nenth the wheel of the trap, where'he sustained several bruises and a crack ed rib, and enme to his wife's help, and when the G)ial made his third rush ha was drlveu off by Cnptalu Spenee, when he made off at a gallop, but the pursuit was taken up and be was ulti mately run down and shot. , An Kihlblt on Wheels.

ECONOMIC COII)ITIOJI9." Restoration of ConBdence and Re torn of Prosperity. nnrlns the last Ave yenrs business con. flitnncs has been restored, and the Na tion la to be congratulated because of Ita present abounding prosperity, oucn pros perity can never be created by law alone, although It Is easy enough to destroy It by mischievous laws. In dealing with business Interests, for the Government to undertake, by crude and Ill-considered legislation, to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to- Incur the risk of such far-reachtng national disaster that It would be pref erable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the Impossible or the undesirable serve aa the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and In what manner It Is practi cable to supply remedies. . I Regulation of Corporation. ' There Is a widespread conviction In the mlmls of .the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are In certain of their restores ana tennen cles hurtful to the general welfare. This springs from no spirit of envy or un- charltab:eness, nor lack of pride In the great Industrial achievements that have placed thl country at the head or the nations .struggling for commercial ' su premacy. It Is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concen tration should be, not prohibited, but su pervised, and, within reasonable limits, controlled; and In my judgment this con viction la rlaht. The first essential In determining how to deal with tha great Industrial combina tions is knowledge of facts publicity. Department of Commerce and Indus. tries. There should be created a Cabinet of ficer, to be known aa Secretary of Com merce and Industries,- as provided In the bill Introduced at the last session of the Congress. It should be his province to deal with commerce tn Its broadest eenee; Including among many other things what, ever concerns labor and all matters affect' Ins- the great business corporations ana our merchant marine. Chinese Exclusion.' Not only must our labor be protected by the tariff, but It should a mo De pro tected, so far as It Is possible, from the presence In thla country of any luborers brought over By contract, or ot tnose wno coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can un. darsell our men In the lnbor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard It as necessary, with this end In view, to re enact immediately the law excluding Chi nese laborers, and to strengthen It wher ever necessary In order to inuke Its en forcement entirely effective. Trades Intone. , The moet vital problem with which thtr country, and tor thnt matter the whole civilised world, has to deal, la the prob lem which has (or one aide the better ment of social conditions, moral and phy sical. In large cities, and for another side the effort to deal with that tangle of far reaching question which we group togeth er when we speak or "labor." The chief factor tn the success of each man wagc worker, farmer and 'Capitalist alike muss ever be the sum total of ht own In dividual qualities and abilities. Second only to this cornea the power of act ing in combination or association witn others. Very great good has been and will be accomplished by associations or unions of wage-workers, when managed with forethought and when they coin bins Insistence upon their own rights with law-abiding respect for.4he rights of oth er. . ...... : ' Better Immigration Laws Needed. Our present Immigration laws are un antletactory. We need every honest and efficient Immigrant titled to become an American cltlen, every Immigrant wno come here' to Btay, who brings here -a strong body, a stout heart, a good head, and a resolute, purpose to do his duty well In every way, and to bring up his chil dren aa law-abiding and God-fearing members ot the community. Hut there should be a comprehensive law enacted with the object of working a three-fold Improvement over our present- system. Both the educational and economic tests In a wise Immigration law should be de signed to protect and elevate tne general hn lu .mllil.. n,,H .nlfll A unr Hit. pervfston should 'be exercised over the steamship companies, which mainly bring over the Immigrants, and they should be held to a strict accountability for any infraction or tne law. ..... ...Tariff Revision Hurtful. . Thero is general acquiescence In our ? resent tariff system as a Nutlonnl policy, he first requisite to our. prosperity Is the continuity and stability of this economic policy. Nothing could ,b mora unwise tban to disturb the business Interests of the country by any general tariff chunge at this time Reciprocity must be treated as the hana- mqlilpn of nroteetlon. Ilnr tlrst riutv'la to i that the protection granted by' the turin in every case wnere it is neeat'o is maintained, tend that reciprocity be sought for so far as It can safely be done with out Injury to our home Industries. " , Condition of the Merchant Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such aa to call for Imme diate remedial action by the Congress. It is discreditable to us as a Nation .that our merclmnt marine ahould be utterly Insignificant In comparison to that of other nations which wo overtop In other forms of buslnesa, We should not longer submit to conditions under which only a trifling portion of our great comfherc la curried in our own ships. ' ,i .' Financial Matters. ' In many respects the National banking law furnishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of the banking function; but there seems to be need of better safeguards agalnat the deranging Influence of commercial crises and financial panics. Moreover, the currency of tha country! ahould be made responsive to the de mands of our domestic trade and commerce. ' tarsia la the Treasury. The collection from duttea on import and Internal tuies continue to exceed the ordinary expenditures of , the Government, thanks mainly to tha reduced Army ex penditures. The utmost care ahould be taken luit to reduce the revenuea so that there will be any possibility of a deficit; but, after providing agalnat any such con. tlngency, means should be adopted which will bring the revenues more nearly with in the limit of our actual needs. In his report to the Congress the Secretary of the Treasury considers all these questions at length, and I auk your attention to the report and recommendationa. - Interstate Conneree Law. In 1887 a measure waa enacted for tne regulation of interstate railways, com monly known as the Interstate commerce act. The cardinal provisions of that act were that railway rates should be Just and reasonable, and that all shipper, local ities and commodities ahould be accorded equal treatment. A commission wa cre ated and endowed with what were sup posed to be the necessary powers to exe cute the provisions of thl act. The act should be amended. The rail way Is a public servant. Its rates ahould I" Just lo and open to all shipper a I.e. The Government should see to it that within Its Jurisdiction this la so, and should provide a speedy, Inexpensive and effective remedy to that end. i Department of Aarlenltare.

INSULAR JATTERS..; What Must Be Done to Develop '', Hawaii. In Hawaii our aim must bo to develop the territory on the traditional Ameri can line ,, Porto Rlea. .. It Is a pleasure to say that it Is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto Rico than aa to any state or territory within our continental limits. The isl and Is thriving as never before, and It is being administered efficiently and honest ly. Its people are now enjoying liberty and order under the protection of the United States, and upon this fact we con gratulate them and ourselves. Cuba. In Cuba such progress has been made toward putting the Independent govern ment of the Island upon a firm footing thnt before the present aesBlon of the Con gress closes this wilt be an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress: and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, aa She unfolds this new page of her destiny,' we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Elsewhere I have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of Na tional interest why the policy ahould be held to have a peculiar application, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom. Indeed to the vital need, of pro viding for a substantial reduction In the tariff duties on Cuban imports into the United States. The Philippines. . . In the Philippines our problem is larg er. They are very rich tropical Islands. Inhabited by mahy varying tribes, repre senting widely different stages of pro gress toward civilization. Our earnest effort la to' help these people upward along the stony, and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of the islands honorable to our Nation by making It of the highest benefit to the Filipinos them selves: and as sn earnest of what we in tend to do, we point to what we have done. ' -. Additional Legislation Needed, The time haa come when there should be additional legislation for the Philip pines. Nothing better can be done for the Islands than to Introduce induatrlal enter prises. Nothing would benefit them so much as throwing them open to industrial develooment. The connection between Idleness and mischief la proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work la one of the surest preventives of war. . .. .. Pacific Cable. I call your attention most earnestly to tho crying need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Phlllnnlnes to points In Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable. It is fle- manded not merely for commercial, but for political and military considerations.

NAVY DEPARTMENT. . Work of Upnnlldlnar It Must Be Steadily Contlaned. ' There ahould ba no cessation In the work of completing our Navy. So far Ingenuity has been wholly unable to de vise & substitute for the greet wr than additional ships, and this Is addi tional officera and men. To provide bat-tle-ehlps and cruisers and then lay them up, with the expectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed In actual craft whose hammering guns beat out the mastery of the high seas. It la unsafe and unwise not to provide this year tor several additional battle-ships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary and lighter craft in proportion; for the exact numbers and character I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Navy. But there is something we need even more war. would be worse than folly; It would be a crime against the Nation. 1 The Naval Mllltla. The naval mllltla forces are state organ isations, and are trained for coast service, and, in event of war, they will constitute the inner line of defense. They should re ceive hearty encouragement from th General Government, WAR DEPARTMENT. Army Is Larare Eaoogh at the Pres. ... ,(' ' ent Tiaae. ; .. It is not necessary to increase our Army beyond its present else at this time. But It is necessary to keep it at the highest point of efficiency. The Individual units who as officers and enlisted men compose this Army. are. we have good reason to believe, at least as efficient as those of any other army in the entire world. It la our duty to see that their training is of a kind to Insure the highest passible expression of power to these units when acting in combination. Debt Dae to the Veteran Who Ssved , . the I n Ion. No other citizens deserve so well ot the Republic as the veterans, the sur vivors of those who saved the Union. They did tne one deed which, if left undone, would have meant atiat all else tn our history went for nothing. But for tneir steadfast prowess In the greatest crisis of our hiatory, all our annals would be mean ingless, and our great experiment in pop ular . freedom , and self-government a gloomy fallue. .- ' "' Civil Service. I recommend the passage cf a law which will extend the classified service to the District of Columbia, or will at least enable the President thus to extend It In my Judgment all laws providing for the temporary employment . of clerks Should hereafter contain provision that they be selected under the civil service law. :....' The merit system Is simply one method of securing honest and etnclent adminis tration of the Government; and In- the long run the sole justification of any t)?e of government lies in Its proving itself both honest and efficient. The consular service is now organised under the provisions of a law passed In 1S54, which Is entirely Inadequate to ex isting conditions Forests Are' Reservoirs. The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams In flood and re plenishing them in drought they make possible tne use of waters otherwise wast ed. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with slit. Forest conservation is. therefore, an essential condition of water conservation. The Government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as It does other public works. Where their purpose Is to regulate the flow of streams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season, to take the same course under the same taws. as the natural flow. Treatment of Indian. In my Judgment the time lias arrived when we should definitely make up our minds to recognise the Indian aa an indi vidual and not as a member ot a tribe. Permanent Cenans Bnrean. ' For the sake of good administration, sound economy and the advancement ot science, the Census Office, as now consti tuted, should be made a permanent Gov ernment bureau. This would Insure , bet. tr, cheaper and more satisfactory work, In the Interest not only of our bualness, but of statistic, economic and social sci ence. .-..'..'. ; . The Postal Sevviea. The remarkable growth of the postal service Is shown in the fact that Ita reve. nuea have doubled and its expenditures have nearly doubled within 12 years. Its progressive development compels con stantly increasing outlay, but in this pe riod of business energy and prosperity its receipts grow so much faster than its ex. penses that the annual deficit has been steadily reduced from HMll.TO In 1SS7 to t3.S23.727 in 1901. Among recent postal ad vances the success of rural free delivery wherever established has been so marked, and actual experience has made its bene fits so plain, that the demand for Its ex tension Is general and urgent. i,- Chlnese Situation. ' The general terms of tha settlement of the questions growing out of the anti foreign uprisings in China of 1900, having been formulated In a Joint note addressed to China by the representatives of the injured powers in December last, were promptly accepted by the Chinese Gov. ernment.' After protracted ' conferences the plenipotentiaries of the several powers were able to sign a nnai protocol wun the .Chinese plenipotentiaries on the 7th of last September, setting forth the meas ures taken by China In eompllanoe with the demands of the joint note, and ex pressing their satisfaction therewith The agreement, reacnea aisposes m s manner satisfactory to the powers of the various grounds of complaint, and will contribute materially to better future re lations between China and the powers.
