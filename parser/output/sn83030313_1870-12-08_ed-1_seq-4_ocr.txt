Lust evening tlie usually quiet town of ltockvllle, tn Maryland, was the scene or a great sensation, consisting of a lecture by John Q. Surratt concern ing the secret history or Conloderate conspiracies, which culm.nuted In the assassination of President Lincoln. Hnco his trial and acquittal upon chargo or complicity In that perfidious plot Snrratt has sojourned in Maryland, and his present occupa tion Is that or a school teacher In Bockvllle. In order, as he says, to realize some funds? his remuno- j ration as school teacner being insufficient to meet his wants? he determined to enter the field as a pub. ilo lecturer. Accordingly the following announce* meut appeared in the Rockvilie paper:? "Lecture by John 11. Surratt on Tuesday evening, December 0, 1870. John LI. Surratt will deliver a lecture In the Court House in ltockvllle on "his Introduction to 3. Wilkes Booth; the plot lor the abduction of Pre sident Lincoln, Its lailure and abandonment; tils trip to Richmond nnd from thcnce to Canada, aud then by orders to Elmira, and what was done there; hi* hearing or the assassination or President Lincoln; his escaue back to Canada and concealment there; the efforts ol detectives to ariest him, and means used to battle them; his final de parture lor Europe. Doors open at half-Dast six; lecture commences at seven. Aduilttauce fllty cents; children hall price."

THE LECriBK. Lames and gknti.emen? Upon entering that door a few moments ago the lmpre?slon on my mincl was so strong as to vividly recall BCenes or three years ago.

On the contrary, I dislike notoriety and leave my solitude and obscurity unwillingly. Neither la It anything for notoriety or fame.

At Hie breaking oat of the war I was a student ai m. diaries College, in Maryland, but did tot remain Ion,* there aiwr wiat important event. I left in July, ivi.and, returning home, commenced to take active i art in t tie stirring events of that period. 1 was not more tmn elgti teen years of ago, ana wn mostly engaged in sending Information regarding the m,ov<? neut- of the United Mate Army, stationed In Washington and elsewhere, and carrying fl> ^patches to thn Con federate boats ou the I'otoinac, We had a regular established line from Washington to the Potomac, and I, being the only unmarried man on the route, had most of the hard riding to do. (Laugh, ter.) i devised various way* to curry iho despatches ? .sometimes In the heel of my boots, somoumes l>ci ween the plai Ks oi t no buggy. I con fess that nev?r !? my life did I cnie across a more stupid set of detectives than those generally employed by the United Slates government. They seemed to have no idea whatever how to search men. In lSfll my family leit Maryland and moved to Washington, where 1 took a still active part in tne stirring events of that period. It was a fascinating life to me. It seemed a? If I < Quid not do too iiiujli or run too great a risk. In the fall of 1904 I wai 

INTRODUCED TO J. W1LKKS BOOTH, Who, I was given to understand, wished to knjw something at>out the main avenues leading from W'aHhlngton to the Fotomac. We met several tines, but as he secerned to bo r tlcent with regard to his purposes, and very anxious to g t all the I n forma flon out of mo lie c< u d, i refused to tell him any thing at all. At last I said to him, "It is useless lor you, Mr, Ilooth, to seek any In formation at all; 1 know wLo you are and what are your inteutlons." lie hesitated some time, but finally said he would make known his views to me provided 1 would pro mine secrecy. 1 replied, *i will do nothing of the kind. You know wall 1 am a southern man. if you cusnot trust mo we win separate." lie then said, "I will confine my plass to you, but tierore doing so I win make known to you the mo tives that actuate mr."

"Woll sir. what U y oar proposition?" Be sat Quiet for an Instant, ana then, before answering me, arese and looked under the bed, Into ttie wardrobe, In the doorway and passage, and then said.

"Kidnap Presi dent Llnco'n !" I Bald. 1 csnfess that 1 stood agnast at the proposition and looked upen It as a foolhardy undertaking. To think or successfully seizing Mr. Lincoln In the capltaliof the United States surro .nded by thousands of his soldiers, an t carry* tog nim o? to Richmond, looked to me like a foollsa idea.

After two day*' reflection 1 told him I was WILLINU TO THY. 1 believed it practicable at that time, thonirh I now regard it as a foolhardy un dertaking. I hone you will not blame mo for going thus fur. 1 honestly thougnt an exchange of prisoners could bo brought about could we have obcj obtained possesion of Mr. Lin coln's person.

(Applause.) fet ch a thing r?b the assassination of Mr. Lincoln I never heard spoken of by any of the party? never. (Hen sat Ion). WHAT WAS HEARD AND WHAT WAS DONB AT A MKKTINO OK TUK CONSPIRATORS. Upon one occasion I remember we had called a meeting in Washington for the purpose of dlscussiug matters In gene a), as we had understood that the government bad received information that thore was a tilot of so ne klad on hand. They had even commenced to bull I a stockade and gates on the JNavy Yard bridge? gatet opening towards the south, us though they expected danger iroin within, and not from without. At this meeting I explained the con structleu ol the gales, Ac., an I stated that 1 was con fident that the government had wlud of our move, inent, aud that t!io beat thing we could do would be to throw up the wliole project. Every one seemed to coincide in my opinion except Uootx who snt ?silent and attracted. Arising at last and bringing ilown his flst npon the table, ne said, "Well, g 'ntie men, if the worst cornea to the worst I shall know what to do." Homo hard words, anu even threats, then passed between htm and souje Of the nartv. Four of us then ft rose, pne saying, ''If T flfuleY stand yoll to intimate ahythlig more than the capture of Mr. Lincoln I for one will bid you goodby." Every one expressed the same opinion. Wo all aroso and commenced putting on oar hats. Booth perceiving, probably, that he had gene too far, asked pardon, saying that ho had (frank too much champagne. Alter some (lull c til ty everything was ninicably arranged and wo sepa rated at live o'clock in the morning. TUK riRST ATTEMPT AT ABDUCTION AND HOW DE FEATED. Days, weeks and months passed by without an op portunity presenting ltscir for us to attempt the cap* ture. Wo seldom saw one another, owing to the many rumors afloat that a conspiracy of some kind was oelug coucocted lu Wasluugton. We ha 1 all arrangements effected from Washington for the pur pose. Boats were lu readiness to carry us across tue river. One day we received information that the 1 President would visit the Heventn Street Hospital for tho purpose of beiag present at an entertain ment to he given for the benefit of the wounded sol diers. The report only reached us about three quarters of an hour before tho time appointed, but eu perfect was our communication mat wo were instantly In our saddles on the way to the hospital. This was between one aud two o'clock in the afternoon. It was our Intention to seize the carriage, which was drawn by a splendid pair ol horses, and to nave one of our men mount the box and drive direct for Southern Maryland via Benulug'd bridge. We felt confident 'that all the cavulry in tne city could never over haul u . We were all mounted ou swift horses, besides having a thorough knowledge of the country? it being determined to abandon the carriage after passing tne city limits. Upon tho suddenness of the blow and tne celerity of our move ments we depeuded for success. By the time tho alarm could have been given and horses saddled we woutd have been ou our way through Southern Maryland towards vhe Potomac river. To our great disappointment, however, the President was not there, but one of the government officials, Mr. Chase. U 1 mistake not we did not disturb blm, as we want a a bigger chase? (laughter)? than he could have aOorued us. It was certainly a bitter disap pointment, but yet, I tlunk, a most fortunate one for us. It was our last attempt. THE 

PLOT ABANDONED. We soon after this became convinced that we could not remain much longer undiscovered, ,atid that we must abandon our enterprise. Accordingly a separation finally took place, and I never after saw nuy of the party except one, and that was when I was on my wav from Illchmon, to Canada on business of quite a dif ferent nature, about which I will speak presently. Such Is the srory of our abduction plot? rash, per haps foo.lsh, but honorable I maintain In its means and ends, and actrated by such motives as wonld, under Mmllar circumstances, be a sufficient Induce ment for thousand- of Southern young men to have embarked in a similar enterprise. AS INTERVIEW WITH MR. BENJAMIN. Shortly after our abandonment of the abduction scheme, some despatches came to me which 1 was compelled to see through to Richmond. 'J hey were foreign ones, and had no reference whatever to itils noalr. I accordingly left homo for Richmond, and arrived there safely on the Friday evening before tho evacua tion of that city. On my arrival I went to Pp'jtt3wo#tI Hotel, where I was told that Mr. Benjamin, the then Secretary of War of the Con federal, e States, wanted to see me. 1 accordingly Bought his presence. Ho asked if I would tarry some despatches to Canada for hlin. I replied, Ye*. That evening he Rave me the despatches and $200 In gold, with which to pay iny expenses to Canada. That w.js ttte only money I ever received from the Confederate government, or any of its agents. TiiJi CONKEPEKATE GOVEBNMENT l'OSSESSED NO KNPF^BDOE OF THE PI,OJ, ?It mav he well to remArfc here that this scheme of abduction was concocted without the Knowledge or the assistance of the Confederal e government In any shape or form. Booth ana I oiten consulted together as to whether it would not bo weil to acquaint the authorities tn Richmond with our plan, us we were sadly in want ot money, our expenses being very heavy. In tact, the question arose among as as to whether, alter getting Mr. Lincoln, It wo succeeded in our plan, the Confederate authorities would not surrender us to the United States again, because of our doing this thing without their knowledge or consent; but we never acquainted them with the plan and they never had anything in the wide world to do with it. In tact we were jealous of our undertaking and wanted no outside he>p. ( have rot made this statement to dclead the officers of the Contederato government. They are perfectly able to defend themselves". What 1 have done myself 1 am not ashamed to let the would know. 1 left Richmond on Saturday morn ing berorc the evactiti Hon of that place and reached \\?-htngton the following Monday, at lour o'clock P. M., April 3, 1805. WORTHLESS DETECTIVE". As ?or>n as I reached the Maryland shore I under stood tn it the detectives knew of my trip south and were on the lookout for me. J had been south several times lietore for the secret service, but had never b en caught. At that time 1 was carrying the despatches Mr. Heiviamln gave me In a book entitled "Tlie Lite of John Brown." Iiurlng my trip, and while reading that book, 1 learned, to my utter amazement, that, John Brown was a martyr sitting at the right hand of (lod. (Laughter.) 1 succeeded in reaching Washing ton safety, and in passing up Seventh street met one of our party, ivHo inquired what had be come of Booth? 1 to d him where I had been: that 1 was then on my way to Canada, and tnat I had not seen or heard anything of Booth since our separa tion. Iu view of the fact that Richmond had fallen and that all hopes of the abduction of the i'resident had heen given up, I advised him to go home and go to work. That was the last time 1 saw any oi the party. THK 

LAST NIGHT IN WASHINGTON. I went to a Hotel and stopped over that night, a-* a detective had been to ray house inquiring Of the ser vant my whereabouts. In the early train next mermng, Tuesday, April 4, 13?5, 1 left lor New York, and that was the last time I ever was In Washington tiutli brought there by the United Stales government, a captive. In irons, all reports to the contrary notwithstanding. The Unit >d States, <i? you will remember, tried to prove my presence in Washington the 15th of April, the day on which Mr. Uncoiopnet his death. Upon ar rlv i>g in New York 1 call, d at Booth's house, and was told by the servant tnat he had left that morn ing suddenly, on the ground of going to Boston to fulfli an engagement a: the theatre. IN MONTHS* I? In the evening of the same day l took the cars for Montreal, arrlviag tncre the next day. 1 put up at the St. Lawrence Hotel, registering myself as "John Harrison." such being my two tirst names. (Spe cially afterwards 1 saw General Edward G. Lee, to whom the despatches were directed, anl delivered them to lum. Tiiese de-patches we tried to Introduce as evidence on mv trial : but his Honor, Judge Fisher, ruled them out, 1 despite oi tne fact that the government hud tried to prove that tney had relation to the conspiracy to kill Mr. Lincoln. Tney were on y accounts of some moiey transactions, nothing more ner less. A PLAN TO RELEASE CONFEDERATE PRISONERS. A week et so after my arrival there General I^ee came to mv room and told me he bad a plan on foot to release the Confederate prisoners then In K'mna, New Yoik. He said lie had sent many parties there, but they always got frightened and only naif exe cuted their orders. He a?ke I me if 1 would go there and take a sketch of the prison, find out the number of prl-oners, ulse minor da tads in regard to the number of so.diers on guard, cannon, small arms, Ac. I readily a<> opted the so new labors owing u? the fact that I could not return to Washington for l'enr of the de? tecttves. The news of the evacuation of Richmond did not seem to disturb the General much in hn plan, as he doubtless thought then that the confede racy wanted men mere than ever, no one dreaming that U was virtually at au end. I was uiuchaiaiw u at one expression nude um of by an ex-red witn regard to the suddenness ?r In demise. "D u tne thing; It nldu't even flicker, but went right out." I Laugh i er and applause. | In accordance with General Lee's order I went to Elralra. arriving there on wedneadar, two dajs be fore Mr. Lincoln's death, and registered at the tiralnard House, as usnul, as "John Harri son." The following day I went to work and nails a complete sketch of the prison and aurroundlngs. About ten o'clock on Friday night I retired, iltt'e thlnkiug that on that night a blow would be struck which would forerer blast my hopes and make ma a wanderer In a foreign land. 1 slept the night through aud came down the next morning, Uule dreaming of the storm then brewing around my bead. When I took my seat at the table, about nine o'clock A. M., ? gentleman (? my left remarked:? "?Have you heard the news t" ?'Mo, I've not," I replied. "What la ltf" "Why, "PRXdlllENT LINCOLN AND SEORSTART SEW AUD HAVH BKBN ASSASSINATED !" I really put so Utile falih in what the man said that 1 made a remark that It was too early in the morolog 10 got off such Jokes as that, "It's so," lie said, at the same time drawing out a paper and showing It to me. Bur* enough, there I saw an ac count oi what he told me, but as no names weie mentioned it never occurred to me for an Instant ihat It conld have been Booth or any of the party, for the Blmple reason that 1 had nev?. r hoard anything regarding assassination spoken of during my Intercourse with thorn. ? XPLANATIONg. I had good reason to believe that there was anether conspiracy afloat in Washington. In fact, we all kuew it. One evening, as I was partially lying down in the reading room of the Metropolitan Hotel, twoor three gentlemen came in and looked around, as tf ty make sure that no one was around. They then commenced to talk about what had been done, the best meaus lor tlie expedition, Ac. It being abont dusk and no gaslight, and partially c .ncealed beh.nd a wrung desk, I was an unwilling listener of what occurred. I toid Booth of this afterwards, and he said he had heard some thing to the same effect. It only made us all the more ejger to carry out our plans at an early day for fear some one could get ahead of us. We didn't know what they were after exactly, but we wero well satisfied that their object waj very much the same us ours. Arising from the table I thought over who the party could be, for at that time no name had been telegraphed. 1 was pretty cure it was none of the old party. 1 approached the telegrauh ottice in the main hu.l for tiie purpose of ascertaining If J. Wilkes Booth was In New fork. 1 picked up a blank and wrote, "John Wilkes Booth," giving tne number of the house. I hesitated a mo.uent and tnen tore the paper up, and then wrote one? "J. W. B.," with directions, which 1 iv us led to do, from the fact that dtyUig our whole connection we rarely wrote 6r tele graphed under our propef ha pies, but always In such a manner tlut Do one could understand but ours^Tvt 0nfe ?J UMW l9 letters fi m6 uttc!er cover to my ijuandom friend, Louis J. Weiehman. Doubtie-s you all know who Louis J. V. elchman lsf They wore sent to him because he knew of the plot to abduct Presi dent Lincoln. J proclaim it hero and before the world that Louis Weiehman was a party to the plan to abduct President Lincoln. He had been told all about it. and was constantly importuning me to let hlin become an active member. I refused, lor the simple reason that I told him he could neither ride a lioise nor shoot a pistol, which was a fact. (Laughter.) These wero two KB 

JKS8AKY ACCOMPLISHMENTS for us. My refusal nettied him o he went off, as It afterwards appeared by his testimony, and told some government clerk that ho had a vague Idea that there was a plan of some kind on hand to aoduct President Ltncoln. This he says hlinfteif:? That he conld have spotted every man In the party. Why did not he do itr Booth sometimes was rather suspicious of him, and asked me ir 1 thought he could be trusted t Said I, "Certainly he can; Weiehman is a Southern man;" and l always believed It until 1 had good reason to believe otherwise, becanso ho had furnished Informa tion to the government, besides allowing me access to the government records alter office hours. I nave very little to say of Louis J. Weiehman, but 1 do pronounce hlin a baseborn perjurer? a murderer, or the meatiest hue. Give me a man who can strike his victim dead; but savo me from a man who, through perjury, will cause tt# death r,f an innocent person. Double murderer, hell possesses no worse flend than a character <>1 that kind. (Ap plause.) Away with su< li a character. 1 leave hlni In the pit ol infamy which he has dug for himself, a prey to the lights of his guilty conscience. (Ap plause.) THE 

MORNING AKTER T11E ASSASSINATION, IS KLM1RA, I telegraphed Booth thus:? To J. W. 11., New York :? If yon are In New York le!?trar>li ine. JOHN HARRISON, fclmira, N. V. The operator, after looking over it, said, "Is it J. M\ B.V To which I replied "Yes." He evidently wanted the whole name, and had scarcely finished telegraphing when a door right near the ollico, and opening on tho street, was pushed open, and I heard some one say, ' Yes, there are three or four brothers or them, John, Junius Iirntus, Edwin anil J. Wilkes Booth." The whole truth flashed on me in an instant, and 1 said to myself. "My God, what have 1 done? ' The despatch was still lylnif berore me, aiui I reached over aud took it up, lor the purpose of destroying it, l>at tho operatorstretchcd /oi tti his hand and said, "We must llie all telegrams." My first impulse was to tear It up, but f pitched It back and walked off. The town was In the greatest uproar, flags at half-mast, bells tolling, Ac., Ac. still 1 did hot think that I was In danger, and determined to go Immediately to Baltimore to And out the particulars or the tragedy. But here I wish to sav a few words concerning the register of the Brainafil House. When ruy counsel, by mv own directions, went to seek that regis ter It conld not be round. Our Inability to produce it on the trial inturally cast a suspicion over our allot. )or weeks and months did we seek to And its whereabouts, but to no purpose. Every man who was connected with the hotel was hunted up ami questioned. Every register of the hotel before and alter the one which ought to contain my name was to i>e round, but tho most Important one of all was gone. Now the ques tion is, waat became of that register? The lulted States government, by one of Hs witnesses. Dr. McMillan, knew lu November, 186.', that I lu Elrnira at tlie ilrno of the assassination. A. CflARfiE AfjAINPT THE GOVERNMENT. They Knew It, and they naturally traced me there to tfnd cut what I was doing. That Home ofthe gov ernment emissaries abstracte 1 that register 1 Urmly bylleve, ?r perhaps it is stored awa.v in some of the other government vaults under charge of some Jud^e high in position; but this is only a surmise of mine. Hut the circumstances involve a mystery of villany, which the All-seeing God will bring to light. THE DESPATCH I sent to Booth also from Elmlra it was impos sible to flud. We had tho operator at Washington during my trial, but ho said tho original was gone, though he had a copy or it. in telegraph offices they are compelled to keep all despatches flied. Of course we could not oifer this copy in evidence be cause the original alone would be accepted, and that had keen made away with. DESTROYED EVIDENT!!. So sure was tho government that they had de stroyed all evldeuce of my sojourn In Klmira that in getting tne to Washington in time for Mr. Lin coln's death they brought ine by New V'ork city, but, s? completely were they failed in tills that in their rebutting testimony they saw the absolute neces sity of having me go by Elmlra, and they changed their tactics accordingly That was enough to damn my case in any man's mind. This is a strange fact, but nevertheless true, that the government, having in its possession that hotel register, as well as my despatch to Booth, and knowing l'ully by one of its witnesses that I was in Elmlra, yet tried to prove that 1 was in Wash ington on tne night of Mr. Lincoln's death, giving orders and commanding In general, as they were pleased to say. The gentlemen in El mlra by whom 1 proved my alibi were men of tho highest standing ami integrity, whose testimony the I'nited States government could not and dare not attempt, to impeach. I left Elmlra with the inten tion or going to Baltimore. 1 really did not compre hend at that time the danger i was in. As there was no train gotng south that evening I concluded to go to Canandalgtta and irom there to Baltimore, by way of Elmlra and New Vork. SCItBATT'S FJ/KilJT AM) TRIAI.. T'pon arriving at Cananuaigua on Saturday even ing 1 learned, to my utter disappointment, that no train left until Monday following; so 1 took a room ut the Webster House, registering myself as "John Harrison." The next day 1 went to church. I remem ber it b ing Easter Sunday. 1 can here sarely say that the United States government hud not, tho remotest idea that I stopped anywhere alter I left Eltmra. They thought when I left there I went straight through to Canada. It was a very fortunate Uiinglorme that I could not leave Canandalgua. Now, mark, ladles aod gcntlcinenn if you please. My name was signed midway of the hotel register, with six other parties before and after. There wus no doubt as to the genuineness of my signature, because, the very experts brought by the Cnlteu States to swear to my signature in other lustaDcea swore also that that was my hatidw.itlDg. After all this the register was ruled out bv Judge Fisher, because he was well aware if he admitted it ray case was at au end. I could not be in two places at once, though they tried to make me so. Ll.-teu to ills reason tor so ruling:? " J he prisoner might have stepped down from ( auada to C'anandalgna during his concealment and signed ins name there, for the purpose of protecting himself in the future." It was a likely idea that the proprietor j of a hotel would leave a blank line ou tho register j for my cspeclal benefit. Need I say that the ruling was a most infamous on<\ and ought to damn the Judge who so ruled as a villain in the minds of every honest and upright man. (Loud and prolonged ap ! plause.) Had Judge El 4ier been one of the lawyers for the prosecutl m he could not have worked harder against me than lie did; but, thanks to him, he did me more good than harm. His unprincloled and vindictive character was too apparent to every one lu the court room. 1 could not help smiling at the time to think of the great shrewdness nn i foresight he accorded me by that decision. At times really dating my trial I could scarce recognize any vestiae or my for acr self. Sometimes j wouia ask my self, "Am I the same individual? a in I really the same John If. Surratt?" When that register was produced lu court the Hon. Judge l'lei repout, the leading counsel for tho l ulled States, became exceedingly nervous, cspe -la.l.y when Mr. Bradley refused to show it to hlin, and he tore up several pieces of paper in hts trembling lingers. He evidently saw what a pitiful case ho had, and how he had been made the dupe or his precious worthy Mend, Edwin M. siatiton.

"He under no apprehension as to any serious consequences; remain perfectly quiet, as any action on your part would only tend to make quitters worse. If you cau bo or any service to us we will let you know; but keep quiet." These were the Instructions I received lrom my friend In Washington, lit whom I felt the utmost reliance and who Ithougtit would never de ceive. He also sent me conies of the Aatlnnal In telligencer, containing: evidence for tho defence. I certainly felt greatly relieved, though not entirely satisfied. This news reached me some time In the latter iiort of June, Just nefore the party of gentle- I men of whom 1 have spoken arrived. Thev, too, as sured me there was ao cause for fear. What else could I do but accept these unwavering assurances? Kven had I thought otnerwlse f could not have taken any action resulting In good. Just ?n the eve of my departure to Join a party of gentle men on a hunting excursion, while 1 was watting at the hotel for the train, the proprietor handed mo h paper and said, "Keaa that about the conspira tors." Little did the man know who I was or how closely that paragraph bore upon me or mine. That paper Informed me that on a day which was then present anil at an hour which had then come and gone the most 

T1BIXIRH OK DEMOS was to be enacted. Jt had been determined upon and carried out even betore 1 hail Intimation tliat there was any Manger. It would be folly fur mo to attempt to describe my feelings. After ga/.tug at tne paper tor some time 1 dropped it on the floor, turning on my heels and going directly to tho house where I ha l been stopping berore. When I entered tho room I found my friend Bitting tnero. As soon as he saw me he turned deadly pale, t>ut never uttered a word. I said, "Vou doubtless thought you were acting the part of a friend towards me, but you have deceived me. l may forgive >ou, but 1 can never forget it." "We all thought It for tho best, Charley," he com menced to say, but 1 did nol stay to hear more. I went to my room, remained there until dark and then signified my Intention to leave the place Imme diately. 1 relt reckless as to what should become of me. After visiting Quebec and other places, wttn the reward of f jii.ooo hanging over my head, I did not think it safe to remain there, and so I concluded to SEEK AN ASVI.rM IN FOREtflN T.ANDfl. 1 had nothing now to bind me to this country save an only sister, and 1 knew she would never wantfor kind friends or a good home. For myself It mattered lit tle where 1 went, so iliat I could roam once more a free man. I then went on a venture, and now, ladies and gentlemen. I go forth again on a venture, (iladlv would I have remained hidden among the multitude; but the stern necessities arising from tho blasting of my earthly prospects have forced me to leave my solitude and to stand ayaln before the public gaze as the histo rian of my iwn life. One mitigation to Its distaste fulness in this my first attempt, however, is the kindness with which I have have been listened to, lor which 1 return you, ladies and gentlemen, my sincere and heartfelt thanks. (Applause.) The lecture concluded, the band played "Dixie" and a concert was improvised, the audience not separating till a late hour, during which time Sur nitt was quite a Hon among the ladles present. A WILDJNCENJIARY. "Walter Gregory was arraigned at the F.ssex Mar ket I'ollce Court yesterday on a charge of arson. Herman R.

Born With a Silver fpoon in His Month? The Offering of the United States Senate to Schuyler Colfax, Jr.? A Glimpse of Republican Simplicity. Turning from the nol^eand confusion of Broadway Into the comparative quiet of Maiden lane one mtghl have seen yesterday, in the store of Messrs. Gorham, a somewhat strange commentary upon the vlcisal tudes of American life In the shape of ? magnificent service of silver plate, designed for the princely bat Infantine hands ot Schuytor Col fax, Jr., Esq. This young gentleman, who Is be lleved to be now somewhere about two years old, has Just emerged from the helplessness of long clothes and the sweets of "mother-milk," and the Senators of the United States, wishing to celebrate In a fitting mannor tho entrance into active life of this august scion of an Illustrious race, "without distinction of party." have subscribed about $1,000 and pni It into the hands of Senator Anthony to Invest in a presenta tion servicc of baby silverware? tray, pap bowl, drinking cup, knife, fork and spoon, all complete. The wise meu of the East uearly two thousand years ago brought precious offerings oi francklncenso and myrlih and spices to the cradle of the descendant ol the royal house of David. And in these latter days the wise mea of tne West, prompted, perhaps, by almost similar emotions, have resolved to pay even a mora costly tribute of veneration and holy fear to the offspring of our Vice President, THB 

SERVICE is perhaps as beauMlul and highly finished a series of works or art as the deft hands of American crafts men have yet produced. Each piece bears the ln scriptlen in singularly elegant lettering of SCHUYLER COLFAX, Jr. Presented by the SenahT*s of thh f XLL Co.saucss. ^ TIIE TRAT, %1ileh Is of course the largest and most costly piece in tho set, Is in size about eighteen Inches by twelve. One side Is slightly rounded so as to fit in with tho shape of a circular table, while tho other H raised In ridge of silver bearing a shield with the monogram ol its future illustrious owner. The shield is surrounded? fesiooned as it were? with an exquisitely delicate wreath of flowers, and ears of corn, some tuberoses, gracefully Inlaid wilh va rious shades of gold standing out In conspicuous grace. The surface of the tray is covered with line, carerully cut tracer.r, inlaid with gold. Altogether thu tray and the various other pieces, it may oe said, contain no 1C9S than twelve dlflercnt shades of gold, varying lrom the deep, day* fS 1 gilt whlcti lines the Inside of the cup ttie pale, faint tint winch lias been glYeil to ?ome or the flowers. TIIB DR1KKINU CCP Is also a perfect gem or artistic thought and skill, it Is covered with designs of flowers and leaves, its main ieaturc, however, is a peculiarly beautiful polish, invented by tue Messrs. Gorham, and known as the "pearl" finish. This s irface has a wonder, fully beautiful effect, and gluteus like tiie wings of some tropical Insect lti the fiercc light of an e juuto rial sun. , tiie rxr nowr. naturally comes next In impor:anoe and value, and perhaps. If one could only separate it mentally from the comparatively base uses it will serve, It would seem even superior In beauty to ttic other contents of ttils precious casket. Eacn side of tho bowl is adorned with some human laces, surrounded with wreaths of tlowers. THE KNIFE, FORK AND SPOOV are remarkable for me delicate carving of the han dles in which tliey are held, and which are inlaid with designs and tracery of different shades oi gold. The whole service is lncloscd in a costly rusowooil Case, with purple sdk lining and adorned on the lid with an Inlaid l. gr.ro or a bird, some brilliant winged Inhabitant of Eden, not the flerco eagle of our o\v n glorious land. Looking at this collection ol brllllaat and precious trinkets, upon which so much skill and money and pains have been lavished, one cannot help thinking or tho "simplicity" which French aoctrliu airs philosophers prophMed would distin guish our republican court. Certainly, no prince of the blood in Europe has eaten pan out of a more costly bowl, or qnaffed the milk which the apostle prescribed for babes lrom a more beautiful goblet, or picked up his first few morsels of car nivorous food with a more precious knife. It has been reserved for republican Senators to give point and meaning to the old proverb of being "born with a sliver spoou in one's month." And again, one canuot help contrasting the early life of this happy infant, "born in the purple," and Into whose tiny lap are being showered presents more curious and expensive than fell to tne lot of oven the offspring of Creole emperors, with that of his popular parent. Forty years a/o Schuyler Coirax, Sr., then a rathcrless boy of tender years, was wait ing about the streets of New York, with a sad heart., a half-filled stomach, and nothing cer tainly of any groat promise to look forward to. Steady industry, invincible integrity and the grati tude of a lree people have now made him the lather or what Senator Anthony hiuwcir dubs "Our Ke publlcan Prince." This beautirul service will be exhibited for a few days, beginning wlrh to-morrow, In Messrs. Tiffany'a store, in Union square. SIBMRIXE TORP?DCE?. The tlevll'a Own Weiipon-iUreling of ili?< New York Sosiety ul i'raetical Engineers. Tiie New York Society of Practical Engineers hold a mo .ting last e veiling at the Cooper Institute, at which Mr. Kobert Weir, lately of the United States Navy, read a paper on "Rocket Torpedoes." In the course or Ills reading he stated that the monitor type of war vessel has proved to be the most for midable, and, so far as invulnerability Is concerned, the most perfect, presenting the least surface of ex posure to the shot of an antagonist, and therefore the most readily protected with armor ?f almost any required thickness. The folly or trying to build a floating fort has Just been exposed lu the sad loss of the boasted British iron-clad and tnrreted ship Capt.iin. A heavy lurch In an ordinary storm at sea and the top-heavy craft went down, '.a coffin with FIVE HUNDRED POl'LS ENCLOSED. The protection of a harbor lies not in its forts (be they manned with the best artillery and men), but in the arrangement of its torpsdoea and infernal machines, placed where the adversary must run to his destruction. In our late war the rebels employed torpeooes with marked success in many Instances, an i then exertions did more towards the advance ment of tins diabolical art with us than we could have ever gained without such an unpleasant In centive. After describing the torpedoes usea by Russia, Austria and Great Britain tin ling th? late wars, Mr. Weir proceeded to explain the principle of a projectile invented by himself. The torpedo he stated to be a submarine r#i ket, a slow burning powder being used as the propelling torce. It is plain ami simple and com posed of but two parts, the torpedo or exploding shell and the rocket or propelling shaft. Both parts can be made oi copper, zinc. sheet steel, or thin boiler irou. The exploding part or the projectile In shaded like an ordinary rlrte shell, to present a sur face ot lea-t resistance to the water. The aoea will consist of a delicate percussion fulminate, covered with a thin film or copper covering several Inches of the point of the shell, so that contact with any part of the front will ignite the charge. After a minute description of the weapon, the speaker said that any vessel can be armed w it n tli se torpedoes, one of our monitors armed with three or four of these guns could defy the navies of the world. Numerous experiments have clearly demonstrated the success 01 this pro jectile, For harbor defence these torpedoes would? 111 the opinion of Mr. Weir? do awav with the us? of rorts. Small floating batteries could be nnchored at Intervals across the entrance; batteries that cou;d be made invaluable above aud below water, and armed with several of these guus in each, iming thl calcium light ror night work, thoy w<>uld luanv am hanger Impregnable.
