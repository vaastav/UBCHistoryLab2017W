A Washington despatch dated late Sat ' urdav night, says Gen. Meade has not been ' V removed; and that his late retrograde w movement is endorsed by the entire Cabi net The Army of the Potomac is to be reorganized and made larger than at any former period, and the chief command will be tendered to either Hooker or Thomas. Present corps commanders will be relieved with one exception. Private advices from Richmond state that the Question of re-costruction will be debat ed in the Rebel Congress ; and that many nemberb favor the platform of the North ** ? Carolina Conservatives. Professor Hodoe, accompanying the sur vey of the Union Pacific Railroad, reports tasy grades through Cheyenne Pass, and that coal and iron ore are abundant on the eastern slope. By the arrival of the Fulton from Port Royal, we learn of the loss of the Wee hawken, which sunk at anchor inside of Charleston Bar, Sunday last. Four engi neers and twenty-six of the crew were drowned. A furious gale prevailed at the time, The Weehawken lies in five fathoms of water. John Moroan was seen near Burksville about four o'clock Tuesday, morning, going in the diroction of the Cumberland River. Only two of the officers who escaped from the Columbus Penitentiary are with him. The report of his having crossed the river at Burksville Tuesday evening is generally believed in Louisville to be true. A special dispatch from Knoxville to the Cincinnati Gazette says, our entire loss during the Beige of Knoxville was not more than 1,000 while tho loss of the rebels is not less than 5,000. The Army Vote. We called attention a few days ago, to AH opinion delivered by Judge Oke^,o1 the Guernsey (Ohio) District, in relation to the validity of the votes of Ohio Volunteers cast outside ol the State; but tho great length of the opinion prevented its publica tion in The Register. A synopsis or syl labus of it, showing the grounds upon which the statute was regarded as constitutional, may he interesting to our reader*, and ac cordingly we endeavor to furnish it. The Judge held as follews: The act is not confined in terms to eleo' tions to be held at camps within the State, but evidently contemplates that such elec tions may be held beyond the territorial limits of Ohio; and the question is, there fore, whether the General Assembly had the constitutional power to pass such a law. The justice of tke law and the safeguards provided to secure fairness at the eleotions on the one band, and the imperfections ot the law and the danger of fraud aud coer eion on the other, are by no means decisive of the validity of the act; for this is not a question of expediency, but a question of power; and in deciding the question, it wil] be remembered that it was foreseen in the constitutional convention, a* appears by the debates of that body, that tho General Assembly would have large discretionary power on the subject ol elections; that tbe presumption is always in favor oi the valid ity of a law until the contrary is manifest', and that tbe General Assembly had tho power to pass this act under the general grant of legislative power, and without any especial grant of power, unless the consti tution has contined to the territorial limits of the State ihe plaees of receiving ballots. While it is probable that under the con ?titution of 1802, the General Assembly was prohibited from passing au act like this, the present constitution is silent as to the places where the ballots shall be cast; and uo provision of it. fairly construed, d#es more than hx tbe qualiiications of voters.? And although legislation like this may not have been in the minds ol the Irainers constitution, neither was this rebellion, which has called away so great a number ol meritorious voters. Many acts have been held valid when the framers of tho consti could not have foreseen their necessity. The constitution, in requiring that a voter 'shall have been a resident ol the State one year next preceding the election,1' means only that a voter must have been domiciled in the State at least one year at the time of the election. A soldier does not lose his domicil by following his business: though absent for years, he is a legal voter at home, and there alone can his vote be effective; but the ballot may be cast at any place that the legislature provides. And the same re marks apply to tho provision as to tlu char acter of the voter's residence k*in the eeun ty, township or ward in which he resides. True, the constitutional provision is gen eral, that certain persons may "vote at all elections,'' and it is not stated in what man ner elections shall be held, except that they shall be by ballot. They are spoken of as something already understood by the pub lic. Perhaps it is also true, that at the adoption of tho Constitution, voters in England as well as this country, were gen erally, if not always, required to vote where they actually resided. But there as well as here the whole matter has always been very much subject to legislative control ; there as well as here repeated changes have i been made; and the regulation* . concern ing elections ere not the same in any two State*. Moreover, in England the right of suffrage is confined to the owners of "real estate, and there, unlike Ohio at the pres ent time, no reason has ever existed for al lowing a poll beyond the territorial limits. That the law is to have foroe beyond our territorial limits, is no objection to its va i lidity; for it operates upon, and is to be executed only, by persons who are citizens of Ohio, and whether it shall so operate upon any one is discretionary with him.? No one can be compelled to vote or serve as sn officer under this law. Indeed, the rif ht to vote does not depend an any law, but is conferred by the Constitution. The law only points out how certain persons may avail themselves of a Constitutional right, and although directory to the soldier outside of the State, it is mandatory to clerks of courts and all offioers within the State. The provisions that "Senators and Repre sentatives shall be elected biennially by the electors in the respective counties or dis tricts," and that "the Executive Depart ment shall consist of a Governor" and other officers, "who shall be chosen by the electors of the State, on the second Tues day of October, and at places of voting for members of the General Assembly," must be construed with reference to the general provision already referred to, and manifest ly import resident "electors in the respec tive counties or districts"? electors of the counties or districts. Voting places are di visions smaller than districts or counties 5 consequently, this is a reference to the per sons who shall choose, that is, "electors in the respective counties or districts," while the place of voting is left to the discretion of the General Assembly. Pennsylvania, Connecticut and New Hampshire, where such laws wero held in valid, have each Constitutional provisions that in express terms limit the voting places to the State; and therefore the de cisions in those States can have no control ling influence in Ohio. But if newspapers and like means of in formation should be excluded from the sol dier, or he should bo deprived of tickets, or there should be any coeroion or actual unfairness in conducting the proceedings, the election must be set aside; for the bal lot box can have no permanent existence unless elections are left free and untram meled; and ample prevision is made for contesting such vote. Still, in case of an election, tbe presumption is that all has been fairly done, until the contrary is shown; and mere irregularities in form can never invalidate an honest expression of the pop ular will. Re-enlistment of Soldiers. If thero is one thing more than another which good sense would point out to the Government as sound and vital, and all im portant, it is the re-enlistment of the veter ans. Thi9 matter has evidently not receiv ed the attention its importance demands, for wo find the War Department offering but $100 more bounty for veterans than for raw recruits. It has been shown that every man seour ed by tho last draft cost the Government $1,000, besides a vast amount of irritation, bad blood, &c. Would it not have been the wiser plan to, at once, have offered a boun ty of $1,000 to every veteran who should re enlist within a given time; and, say, $500 to every raw recruit? This would not only have the effect of securing at once, perhaps) all the men required ? but would be coming somewhat Rearer equalizing the burden of the war. Let those tight who were willing and can ? and let those who can not or will not, foot the bills. Wo bave no doubt but, the greater the outlay of cash and blood, at once, the soon er will we see peace. In commenting on the President's Proc lamation which accompanied his Message, the New York World says : As a means of recovering the South and reconstructing the Union, his scheme is simply absurd. To divide the Emancipation proclamation (the most odious and detested in the Southern eyes of all Mr. Lincoln's acts) into indi vidual doses, to be administered in the form of an oath, is about as wise as would be an attempt to conciliate a nation of Jews by swearing them all to dine on pork. No won der that, on this system, Mr. Lincoln ex pects his new State governments will be the work of a chosen few. A correspondent of the Cincinnati Com mercial urges the expediency of calling out the uniformed militia to till the quota of Ohio under the present draft. Most of these companies are already armed and uniformed. It is not impossible they may prefer leather-beds and home service to fac;ng rebel bullets. The Press on the President's Message. We have before us a variety of extracts taken from the newspaper comments on the President's message, but want of space compels us to omit them. Suffice it to say that the administration journals generally commend the views of the President, while those of the opposition express various dissentitent opinions. The New York Journal of Commerce , a conservative paper referring to the President's proffered am, nestv and plan to reconstruct the l'nion> remarks : It is plain that what Mr. Linooln wants is peace and abolition. He does not take into consideration at all the question of peace without abolition. In this respect he lends himself entirely to the radical abolitionists. and evidently expects to continue the war until slavery is actually abolished where his old proclamation has theoretically abolished it. The President's idea of closing the war is by a sort of individual and personal con tract -with each and every man, womsn and child, to the effect that if the person will sustain all the policy of the administration and all its acts and proclamations, he or she will be pardoned. The offer is doubtless one which the President has the right to make. If the people will accept it, it is a very neat and pretty way of aoing up the war. Bat it certainly does not hold out very brilliant prospects of success ss a pa cificatory measure. * * * * We see no prospect of peace or good to the country in the President's plan. On the contrary, we fear he has thrown away a golden oppor tunity for the country, for the sake of win ning a support among Northern radicals for himself. ? < ? ? I A 

WALK ABOUTWASHiNGTON. ^Oocaiional Correspondence of the Daily Register.] Come, reader, let us take an hour's walk about this famous city. These elegant street cars are an admirable relief to the weary pedestrian in his transits o'er these "magnifi cent distances." We enter those on 7th street, pay Ave cents? and get a ''transfer'' ? are soon whistled to the world known Penn sylvania Avenus ? and now with this little, punctured paper in our fingers we "go aboard'' the line running directly from the Navy Yard on the East, to Georgetown on the West ? a distance of five miles ? said document paying our fare to either ex treme?cheap. W ell ? which way now shall we go? To the President's house, west ward, of course. We are soon at it ? having passed the great Treasury buildings with their imposing colonade front on 17th street. The way to the door of the royal mansion is a grand semi-circle, leading from a strong iron gate at each end of the beau tiful grounds fronting the building. We will go in The gate is open ? making our way to the orifice in the white edifice which gives ingress and egress to the world-famed Uncle Abe, we find an extremely dignified porter there who politely informs us that the sacred personage whom we have come so far, to see, is too indisposed to receive visitors. Disappointed, wo turn for a fow minutes into that noted East room, and walk awhile amid scenes, furniture and pic tures on which even greater men than ue, have looked in days long since gone by. ? We retrace our steps, and in a few minutes find ourselves in the magnificent grounds immediately north of this House, surround ing the famous Jackson equestrian statue We could spend hours here admiring the sculpture, shrubbery, and walks of the love ly place, but? let us say "admiral," and re | enter the cars, and go back up the aye^.e to the Capitol. See! the park around this mighty building is as near a Paradise as man can make it. What splendid walks-lovely trees? convenient seats? grand promenades ?singular fish-ponds and other artistic and costly arrangements are here. But, look at the building itself. Did you ever see any thing of human construction so majestic as that house with its great wings and heaven propping dome! Sure am I you never did, nor perhaps, never willlook|upon anything man has ever done, more imposing. A few days since yon pinacle was placed on the spire. It appear? small from here, but it is really a huge head of bronze on the statue ot the Goddess of Liberty. It went up amid loud cheers of thousands of spectators and the thundering of cannon from the cordon of Forts that surround this city. It is now said "The Capitol is finished."' W e enter it? 'but not until we have ascended many flights of marble stair-ways zig-zaging in many directions (till after just 100 stepsare passed) do we place foot on the grand Mo saic of the indiscribably majestic rotunda. | After spending an hour here in admiring the elegant pictures and sculpturo placed in and on the colossal walls, wo pass to the right and aro soon ushered into the old Hall of the House uow?deserted? but once the sconce of forensic dispute so keen and eloquent as to become immortal If you wish we will pause a short time to ad mire the exquisite polish of these huge, conglomerate columns that stand like anti deluvian giants around this place. We must not delay too long here, or we will have uo time even to look at the remark able bronze door that leads out ot this Hall into the anti-room of the great, new * orum of Representatives. A door that is a door of wonders. A door whose every panuel, style, cross-rail-casing, facing and archi trave, is of solid bronze, bearing on it MM Poetical, Historical, Mythological, or fan I ciful device in sculpture of the rery finest type.

He is the successor of the noton out Bingham of Ohio. His name is White, j So let ns sight-see. no more to-day. Soon we will renerr our walks about W ash ington. _ _ A correspondent of the cincinnati Com mercial has recently been travelling in West Virginia, and writea.in this complimentary i?tyle of our State and her citizeis: The whole race of the country looks blithed and dead; found only in the heap of j ashes by the neighboring picket tent, a few , pinched hogs and cattle browse the wither- 1 ed grasa at the roadside or stand doubled i and shivering on the sunny side cf a con ?eient hill; ?ccasionaly a chimney stack in the midst of a heap of blackened logs and ashes tells of the penalty which it costs to be loyal, the wretched, dispirited inhabitants eke out the produce of a few dozen shocks by a stray deer or a few pheasanrs; the roads are unworked and untraveled, the laws are uuad ministered, and consequently there is rampant injustice, suspicion and distrust, and little neighborly confidence and intercourse. Whatever little ambition or industry was once found here, is well nigh crushed out, for no man can be sure that he will reap what he sows, and without such assurance labor is dead. Many fami lies are deserted by the male portion who are in the Southern army (and the number of these in great,) many others have aban doned all, and are living as best they can within our lines, while those who are too ignorant to know, or two indifferent to care for either party, remain to bosnbject to continual disturbance. After having seen for myself, some part of the men and regions hereabouts, I must say I am disappoint! d in West Virginia ? that her loyalty is a very questionable arti cle. It it decidedly of the Kentucky order, and the furthest remove from the free-hand eo and open hearted patriotism of glorious East Tennessee, or North Georgia and Ala batna. The people are sour and sullen, and suspicious; nud though there are many no ble and honorable exceptions ? though in the belt of torritory which has been "Abo litionized," as the Richmond papers com plain, by the Baltimore and Onio Railroad, in the Pauhandle, and along the Ohio Val ley, these exceptions are the rule ? still it remains the hard, stern fact that about the whole of the interior of West Virginia has got to be dogged into obedience, or rather, to be kept there. In the fertile river val leys, where it was profitable to own slaves, the people inevitably imbibed Southern ideas, and as a consequence, became re bellious; in tho upland, interior regions, those of them who were not too ignorant to know any thing of the issue involved whatever (and their name is legion,) were pretty equally divided between loyalty and rebellion; while in the mountainous coun try they either have the goitre aud are idi ots entirely, or aro plunged in such impen etrable darkness that they are the merest tools of the party which is strongest for the hour. A Weitern Officer on Reviews.? At Willard's, the other day, a party of gon tlemen entered into conversation about army matters. One of them suggested that it would have a good effect on the Army of the South west, if the President and Secretary of War would viiit it occasionally and review it as he did the Army ot the Potomac. An officer of Grant's array hap-j pening to overhear the remark, said: "Lx cuss me for interrupting you, gentlemen, but we don't want any reviews in the South west, Wo don't want the President nor Secretary of War to come noar us. II they'll juet send us rations and clothes and once in a while a paymaster, we'll get along. D ? n reviews, I say." A "Freedman" in Trouble.? The New Ark (Ohio) Advocate, has the following: The fall term of the Licking court contin ued till Wednesday last. The u freedman '1 whom a barbarous jury found guilty of at tempting to commit a rape, has been granted a new trial by Judge Jones. As there was nothingagainst this negro except j the oath of a white woman, and she a sol dier's wife, bets of two to one were freely offered without takers, thai a new trial would be the result. 1 his women had bettor be on the look out, or before she knows it, they will send her to the penitentiary on a charge of seducing the negro. ^ The Newark (Ohio) Advocate shjs the Sunday visit of Geo. B. Wright to Alorath's brewery a couple of weeks ago, was not an idler urnur, but a reality lie took Gov. Tod to'church in tho morning, and in three hours afterwards had him in Morath's brew ery drinking lager! The visit wa? intend ed for political effect, but an attempt to get Mo rfcth into a political confab tailed, and the distinguished visitors "changed their base." m ? m - A Washington correspondent describes lion.

On the night of the yth ult., the store of Mr. McConkey & Bro., at Peace Bottom, York county, Pa., was robbed cf aboHt $1,600. The wareroom was first broken open with a crowbar, whence the robbers entered the store, drill- f ed the lock off the iron safe, and appropria-J ted the money there ? about S900 of it be ing specie. Phil. Tieman's great match game with | Kavanagh, for the championship of billiards j comes off in Kebuary next, in New \ork. Phil, uses the cue often enough to "keep his hand in,'' but it will be some weeks yet before he will go into regular -training'1 for the match. The Petersburg Express say- that ''tun-, drv persons*' are trying to leave the Confed eracy for Nassau, Bermuda, and elsewhere, with their wealth, in order to shrink tax - J ation and military duty, and to do a block ade running business. The Republican papers tell of a high official who owes his place rather to the butter which he brought to Mrs. Lincoln's table than the brains which he could bring to the public service. A Richmond paper tells of a Dutchman which was so fat that he was -biggest lying down," and says Sumter is strongest in the same attitude. Rev. P.
