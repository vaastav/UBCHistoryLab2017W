PREMIiKNTIAt MEsvVKES -i , , How Lincoln. Johnson’ nml Brant Prerml Their Official Documents—The lliv.ilry to secure Messages in Former Days. Washnißton Post. The capacity of President Cleveland for hard work says a correspondent, is j.erhaps best illustrated by the fact that iio is writing every ward of his message. His experience last year, when lie wrote with his own hand the longest message ever submitted by a president to congress joes not seem (• have dismayed him in the least. This year, although the mes sage will be briefer, it will be of sufficient length to make the physical task of writ ing it somewhat laborous. Thoroughly engrossed in his work, the president sees as few callers as he possibly can. He takes no recreation except a drive in the afternoon, and even Thanksgiving day was devoted to work. From morning to night he bends over his desk —a histori cal piece of furniture, made from the timbers of the ship Rescue and presented to this government by (Jueen Victoria ( if England. He writes n small cramped hand, but his pen moves over the paper with considerable ease, and he rarely has occasion to revise his matter. All the phrases in his writings which have become famous were first thought*. Very few persons have any idea of the great amount of detail which the presi dent accomplishes. All his veto mes -ages were written by him personally, and that too, in the longest possible way. In returning house bill No. f>96B, for in stance, he wrote. “House bill number live thousand nine hundred and sixty eight.” He penned his Thanksgiving proclamation. Many of the letters which other presidents turned over to their secretaries are answered by him in per son. He even addressed with his own hand the envelope which informed Dis trict Attorney Benton of his reinstate ment. In personally writing his messages President Cleveland differs from any of tiis predecessors. Lincoln wrote compar atively little of his messages, but hs paid done attention to the phraseology. In those days the “bnts” and the “ifs” counted. He wrote a small, even hand, easily read, and his manuscript was "ot often marred by erasures. Johnson, who fallowed him. wrote still loss. His right arm was crippled and he could not raise it to his head. He used pen mid ink bat rarely, finding a lead pmcil less tiresome. It. is said that he did not write a letter in ink after he be came president. He signed his name frequently, of course, but an entire letter in his handwriting is now worth almost its weight in gold. H dictated his mes sages to Col. William G. Moore, who was then his private secretary. He thought quickly, for the impossibility of writing developed the faculty of dictation to its highest degree. I’r.sident Grant sent eight messages to congress. They were in the main con irihutions from his cabinet others, writ ten in the first person and then dove tailed together.. They were not finally submitted, however, without careful con sideratiou. Grant was cautious and con servative and carefully modified nud re vised the recommendations of his cabinet officers. He loved to write, and all the additions and emendations of (ho mes sages were in his own handwriting. He wrote many autograph letters, and his vetoes wore also in his own hand. He eould dictate, but not easily, and when ever he wanted to be particularly sorciblo he shut himself in his room and, free Irom interruption, wrote out in full what he desired to say. Mr. Hayes wrote a sprawley irregular baud, hard to revd by those who were un accustomed to it. His message was largely the work of Mr. Rodgers, his private secretary, a man of considerable scholorship. Whatever polish they con tained was due entirely to Mr. Rodgers, and many portions, indeed, were written by the latter in the first instance. The cabinet officers aided largely in the work and their contributions were used with out revision. President Arthur’s hand writing was bold and largo, showing con -idcrable force, snd (he words and let ; ters were joined in an easy running style ns if the writer had done considerable clerical duty. Surrogate Rollins, of New VorK, it is not generally known, was Mr. Arthur’s right-hand man in the prepara tion of the messages. Together they ar ranged the topics to be treated upon and many of the ideas contained in the documents emanated directly from Mr. Rollins. hi former days the messagea weredmp- j heated on manifold paper, and when the j private secretary was supposed to have reached the c.apitol for there was no ‘ telegraph or telephone connection with j the while house then copies were dis tributed to the anxious correspondents 1 nd reporters.

VICE PTESIDKM's. They Are to Adorn the (iallery of the senate A (iood Portrait of Mr. Arthur Last April, writes a Whington cor rt‘-pondent of the New York Herald, the sonate library committee reported a reso lution authorizing the payment from the contingent fund of a sum sufficient for the purchase of the busts of the vice presidents from John Adams down to the present time. The resolution, which was adopted without debate, provided that no more than five busts should be received within one fiscal year, and that each should be modeled by an artist re siding in the same state with the subject. The matter was then placed in the charge of Mr. Edward Clark, the architect of the capitol. It was finally decided that the first five should be the busts of the three vice presidents then living, viz.. Hanni bal Hamlin, William A. Wheeler, and Chester A. Arthur, and then revert to Adams and Jefferson, coming down the line to Mr. Hendricks. The list includes only the legally-elected vice presidents, and not (hose who may have filled the office ad interim. It is the intention to place the five busts of those above-mentioned in the niches of the north wall of the senate chamber, where the vice presidents gen erally sit, bnt when all shall have been finished they will bo arranged chronology cally in their respective niches in the galleries of the senate. The busts will be placed on pedestals of a height suffi cient to prevent being handled by that class of curiously disposed persons who can not be satisfied with anything less than personal contact with whatever hap pens to be placed on exhibition. The pedestal will be chiseled from marble of a color approximating the general tone of the wall- that of Sienha marble. The busts will stand three feet in height. They will be so arranged that the center of the face will be the point from which the semiclucular head of the niche might be descried. They will be executed from the best portraites obtainable. The effort will be to secure portraits contemporaneous with the services of the subject ns vice president. Some difficulty may be experienced, it is feared in procuring good representations of some of the dead statesmen such, for example, as these of Aaron Burr and Daniel Tompkins, of New York. The only goou portrait of burr is believed to bethatinthe possession of Princeton college of which Jonathan Edwards, Mr. Burr's grandfather, was at one time presi dent. Ex-President Arthur, upon being con sulted in regard to the matter, requested that Mr. St. Gandens, of New York City, be Given the work of fashioning his features into clay. Mr. Wheeler expressed no prefeince as to the sculptor, but regretted that on account of his health he could not give a personal sitting. Ho referred Mr. Clark, however, to a portrait, of himself at the bureau of engraving and printing in this city, which he regards ns probably the best presentment of himself in existence, Mr. Clark has asked J. Q. A. Ward, of New York, to perform this work, but it is not known at present whether he will ac cept. To Mr. Franklin Simmons, of Maine, will be assigned the preparation of Mr. Hamlin's bust, while Mr. Daniel French of Massachusetts, and a Mr. Ezekiel, of Virginia will perform a similar service for ex-Presidents Adams and Jefferson. The sum which the artists will receive for this service will be 

SBOO, only one contrac t being awarded to each sculptor. A life-size portrait of President Arthur was made by Leciere, of New York, from many sittings, representing him as a gen 11 email who had just stepped out of the main door of a mansion on to the porch to salute the face of nature on an autum nal morn. In one hand he was holding a book, with one finger between the leaves. A rose, as though fallen from his button hole, lay upon the step. The artist died before the picture could be criticised by Mr. Arthur, and through the aid of an eminent New York and Washington artist the changes desired by him were under taken. They did not relate in any degree to the face, but merely to the size and repose of the body. As changed under Mr. Arthur’s direction this admirable work of art now adorns the white house, and is esteemed as a striking portrait. Tic Certainly I’utHis Faot lull, Calcago Tribune A prominent Chicago real estate man and his partner were the best of friends, and tbeir intimacy extended to personal as well as business matters. His partner was a bachelor, and was in the habit of reading him letters of an ardent and af fectinate nature from a young lady who signed herself “Susie.” The hero of the story went away on an extended trip and returned just in time to attend the wed ding of his partner. Wishing to show his good will he sent the happy couple a wedding present, and at the wedding re ception, stepped gallantly forward to pay his respects. “I hardly feel like a stranger,” he said in his sweetest tones, addressing the bride. “In fact I feel as though 1 ought to be quite well acquainted with my j partner's wife, aiuee he has often done me the honor to read me extracts from his dear Susie’s letters.” Tha faces of the husband and the | speaker were studies as the bride drew herself up and said emphatically and dis tantly; “I beg your pardon, sir, my name is Helen. ’’ The Barber ami the Boyeott Harter Yes, this boycotting is a great ( thing.

A >1 AN WHO " AS vi ALPKIi H>* Say* the Operation Caused Him Ceiisider ahle Tain - A Aery Narrow 1-eape from Dentil. San Fiaccl-co Chronicle. It has often been said that a man can not live after being scalped, writes a Fort Keogh correspondent to the Chron icle. One of the Crow Indian scouts with Custer before that brave officer met his fate was caught by a party of Sioux alone on the prairie and scalped alive. His enemies cut a pear shaped piece out of the crown of his head and left him writh ing in agony, snpoosing ho would of course die. Notwithstanding al! which he “•idured, the redskin recovered, and at last accounts was living with his people on the Crow reservation and doing well. There is an old hunter in western Mon tana whose cabin is located on the east ern slope of the Uocky mountains, who hud Ids hair raised some years ago by a band of savages, and yet he lives and thrives in most astonishing good health. The old fellow's name is Ganzio, and by reason of his advanced years would, in tlie natural course of events, have white hair now, only that he has no hair at all to speak of. Still, what little he has got is whitened or gray, the rest of his head, “where the hair ought t grow,” being as bald as a billiard ball. To be exact, Gan zio did not lose his entire scalp, but only a portion of it. The probabilities are that he could not have survived with the loss of (he whole top of his head. Some few years ago. when Sitting Hull was master of this country, Ganzio was the guide of an emigrant party en route to Fort Laramie. The story of Hint dangerous expedition is an exceedingly interesting one, and ns related by himself it runs as fol folws; “One day we were coming into the val ley of Hut creek, on onr way to Fort Laramie, when we thought wu saw In dians coming down lha creek to the right. Instead of camping there, wo thought it safer to water onr stock and go on to the hills and make a dry camp in the bushes. 1 had been sent on ahead up the hill to reconnoifer, and took with mo a boy named Kountze, from Omaha, mere ly for company. AVe .-.at down to wait for the wagons, which were slowly coming up ont of the valley. AVhen Hie wagons reached us I started on alone through the rocks and pine bushes to seek a good camp. A few hundred yards further on 1 looked down a ravine to the right and faw five mounted Indiana ride across the valley. I started to go back to the train, when at least a dozen ran at me ont of bushes, and you bet I ran and called for help. In a minute more two or three of them shot at me. 1 felt a sharp, sting ing pain in my right leg, and another in my left shoulder, and I fell. Then they were upon me in a minute, and one of them put his knee on my back, while another hit me with a club. Another struck me with the butt of a gun and I became partly unconscious. Still I had reason and feeling enough left to know 1 was being scalped; for Hie hair held so tightly and the pain was so awful that I could not die then even if I wanted to. I felt a hot stinging pain all around the top of :uy head the hair being torn out by the roots, so to speak and it was too much. I died, or at least I thought I did, but ns it happened my sculp or at least a part of it. was saved just as it was being torn off. The boys at the wagon bad seen me running and saw the Indians and came at a run thirteen of them, arriv ing just in time to prevent Hie red devils finishing their work. The Indians, as well as my friends, thought I was dead, but I came to again, and what was left, of my scalp was laid back in its place. It was only half torn off you see, and Hie place is pretty well healed now.” "AA hat did you do with yourself after ward?” “AA hy, I hurried into Fort Laramie, got the attention of a physician, and went bark to Hie states a while; but the western fever cama strong upon me again and I returned to the mountans. where I have been ever since. Calculating the Size ef the Kartli. Exchange. The earlier attempts at calculating the size of the globe were based on astrono mjcal observations. It would be difficult to-day to say within what degree of ac curacy the figure then obtained could have been relied upon, as the nnits of | measurement used by those pioneers have been lost, and could not have been compared with the units now in use. One of the earlier attempts at obtain ing the actual length of the earth’s meri dian hy direct measurement of n portion of the same was made in the sixteenth j century by a French doctor. The means j employed, although very ingenious,! would be considered perfect!; clumsy and inadequate by the modern scientist, i There was in this early measurement no | attempt at mathematical precision as understood in the present century, and considering the simplicity of the method employed by the doctor, it is only to be wondered that no greater error was ob tained in its final result. The measure- | merit consisted simply in driving from Baris to Amiens, and counting the revol utions of the wheels of the carriage, and from the number of revolutions of the wheels of the carriage, obtain the dis tance between the two cities, which could serve as the basis for calculating the length of the meridian. Of course this calculation could not by any means be considered accurate, but, taking into ac count the means employed, the result ob tained has been subsequently found to be wonderfully precise. The most curious thing about it is that what would now be considered grave errors and inexactitudes were so dUtribu ted that they almost compensated each other, and the dimensions then obtained show only slight differences with the dimensions given- hy the most recent i measurements, Thus chance and no | belter name could be found permitted 'of the same results, with only (a small final error, being obtained with that cade method, that are now obtained with the most precise instruments and with the most complicated calculations. As to Whiskers. T wo fallacies are in vogue regarding the ; whisker question, fine is that a thin faced man should support side whisker* to widen his fact: the other that a round ; faced fat man should f avor loug chin I whiskers to lengthen his face. Both are 1 adopted on the coonti r action and anti Jote principle, but are wrong s wrong can be. A man with a sharp chin exposed is thin and appears thin in spite o* his burnsides. And a moon shaped man gives himself a humorous and clownish appearance by wearing a long, sharp tuft on his chin. The principle of conformity should be observed and a wholesale change made. A thin man. for instance, should not wear chin whiskers. Ino whiskers at all, or a beard. He no t more looks well with side whiskers and a peaked chin than he would ( stuff his chest and not his cheeks and calves. To look well he must be uniformly and con sistently thin, or he may modify it by a complete beard. A fat man should be smooth faced or wear universal whiskers prutty closely cropped. A well-propor tioned and moderately full faced man may vary the style and quantity of his whiskers with impunity, so far as the thin or broad appearance i* concerned. Avery short beard gives an animal look; if very large it indicates vanity or crank iness. A SKA lit'tl FOR A
