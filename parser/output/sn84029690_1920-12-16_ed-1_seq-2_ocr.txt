THE HAYS FREE PRESS PRESIDENT SEIDS IN HIS MESSAGE CONGRESS TO JUSTIFY DE MOCRACY BEFORE WORLD. SETS FORTH NATION'S DUTY Says It Is the Manifest Destiny of United States to Lead in Making Spirit of "Right Makes-Might" Pre vail. Washington, Dec 7. Abandoning his Intention to deliver his message to congress In person. President Wilson ent It in and the clerks of both houses read it. Following Is the full text of the message: Gentlemen of the congress: When I addressed myself to per forming the duty laid upon the Presi dent by the Constitution to present to you an annual report of the state of the Union, I found my thought domi nated by an immortal sentence of Abraham Lincoln's, "Let us have faith that right makes might, and In that faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it;" a sentence im mortal because it embodies1 in a form of otter simplicity and purity the essen tial faith of the nation, the faith in which It was conceived, and the faith in which it has grown to glory and power. With that faith and the birth of a cation founded upon It came the hope into the world that a new order would prevail throughout the affairs of man kind, an order in which reason and right would take precedence of covet ousness and force, and I believe that I express the wish and purpose of ev ery thoughtful American when I say that this sentence marks for us In the plainest manner the part we should play alike in the arrangement of our domestic affaira and In our exercise of" influence upon the affairs of the world. , By this faith, and by this faith alone, can the world be lifted out of its present confusion and despair. It was this faith which prevailed over the wicked force of Germany. You will remember that the beginning of the end of the war came when the German people found themselves face to face with the conscience of the world, and realized that right was ev erywhere arrayed against the wrong that their government was attempting to perpetrate. I think, therefore, that it Is true to say that this was the faith which won the war. Certainly this Is the faith with which our gal lant men went Into the field and out upon the seas to make sure of victory. This is the mission upon which de mocracy came into the world. Democ racy is an assertion cf the right of the individual to live and to be treated Justly as against any attempt on the part of any combination of individuals to make laws which will overburden him or which will destroy his equality among his fellows In the matter of right or privilege, and I think we all realize, that the day has come when democracy is being put upon its final test. The old world Is just now suf fering from a wanton rejection of the principle of democracy and a substitu tion of the principle of autocracy as" asserted in the name but without the authority and sanction of the multi tude. .This" Is the time of all others when democracy should prove Its puri ty and its spiritual power to prevail. It Is surely the manifest destiny of the United States to lead In the attempt to make this spirit prevail. Two Things for Us to Do. There are two ways In which the United States can assist to accomplish this great object. First, by offering the example within her own borders of the will power of democracy to make and enforce laws which are unques tionably just and which are equal In' their administration laws which se cure Its full right to labor and yet at the same time safeguard the Integrity of property, and particularly of that property which Is devoted to the de velopment of Industry and the in crease of the necessary wealth of the world. Second, by standing for right and justice as towards Individual na tions. The law of democracy is for the protection of the weak and the In fluence of every democracy In the world should be for the protection of the weak nation, the nation which Is struggling toward Its right and to ward Its proper recognition and priv ilege in the family of nations. The United States cannot refuse this role of champion without putting the stigma of rejection upon the great and devoted men who brought Its gov ernment into existence and established It in the face of almost universal op position and intrigue, even in face of wanton force, as, for example, against the order in council of Great Britain and the arbitrary Napoleonic ALL

Sample Democracy of World. I urge you to consider that the dis play of an Immediate disposition on the part of congress to remedy any In justices or evils that may have shown themselves In ocr national life will ; afford the most effectual offset to the forces of chaos and tyranny which are playing so disastrous a part in the fortunes of the free peoples of more than one part of the world. The United Staffs is of necessity the sam ple democracy of the world, and the triumph of democracy depends upon Its success. Recovery from the disturbing and sometimes disastrous effects of the late war has been exceedingly slow on the other side of the water, and has given promise, I venture to say, of early completion only In our own for tunate country; but even with us the recovery halts and Is Impeded at times, and there rfre immediate serviceable nets of legislation which, it seems to me, we ought to attempt to assist that recovery and prove the Indestructible recuperative force of a great govern ment of the people. One of these Is to prove that a great democracy can keep hope as successfully and In as business-like a fashion as any other government. ..It seems to me that the first step toward proving this is to supply ourselves with a method of handling our estimates and expendi tures, and bringing them to the point where they will not be an unnecessary strain upon our Income or necessitate unreasonable taxation; In other words, a workable budget system, and I sug gest that two elements are essential to such a system namely, not only that the proposal of appropriations should be in the hands of a single body, such as a single appropriations committee In each house of the con gress, but also that this body should be brought into such co-operation with the departments of the government and with the treasury of the United States as would enable It to act upon a complete conspectus of the needs of the- government and the resources from which It must draw Its income. I reluctantly vetoed the budget bill passed by the last session of the con gress because of a constitutional objec tion. The house of representatives subsequently modified the bill In order to meet this objection. In the revised form I believe that the bill, coupled with action already taken by the con gress to revise Its rules and procedure, furnishes the foundations for an effec tive national budget system. I ear nestly hope, therefore, that one of the first steps taken by the present session of the congress will be to pass the budget bill. Marked Gain In Finances. The nation's finances have shown marked Improvement during the past year. The total ordinary receipts of $6,694,000,000. for the fiscal year 1920 exceeded those for 1919 by $1,542,000. 000. while the total net ordinary ex penditures decreased from $18,514,000. 000 to $6,403,000,000. The gross public debt, which reached Its highest point on Aug. 31. 1919, when It was $26,596. 000.000, had dropped on Nov. SO, 1920, to $24,175,000,000. There also has been a marked decrease In holdings of gov ernment war securities by the banking Institutions of the country, as well as the amount of bills held by the federal reserve banks secured by government war obligations. This fortunate result has relieved the banks and left them freer to finance the needs of agriculture, industry and commerce. It has been due in large part to the reduction of the public debt, especially of the floating debt, but more particularly to the improved distribution of government securities among permanent investors. The ces sation of the government's borrowings except through short term certificates of indebtedness has been a matter of great consequence to the people of the country at large, as well as to the holders of Liberty bonds and Victory notes, and has had an Important bear ing on the matter of effective credit control. The year has been characterized by the progressive withdrawal of the treasury from the domestic credit market and from a position of dominant Influence in that market. The future course will nec essarily depend upon the extent to which economies are practiced and upon the burdens placed upon the treasury, as well as upon industrial development and the maintenance of tax receipts at a suf ficiently high leveL Big Bond Issue to Mature. The fundamental fact which at present dominates the government's financial sit uation is that $7,500,000,000 of its war In debtedness matures within the next two and a half years. Of this amount $2,500. 000,000 are floating debt and $5,000,000,000 victory notes and war savings certificates. The fiscal program of the government must be determined with reference to these maturities. Sound policy demands that the government expenditures be re duced to the lowest amount which will permit the various services to operate efficiently and that government receipts from taxes and salvage be maintained sufficiently high to provide for current requirements, including Interest and sink ing fund charges on the public debt, and at the same time retire the floating debt and part of the victory loan before ma turity. With rigid economy, vigorous salvage operations and adequate revenues from taxation, a surplus of current receipts over current expenditures can be realized and should be applied to the floating debt. All branches of the government should co-operate to see that this program la realized. I cannot overemphasize the necessity of economy in government appropriations and expenditures and the avoidance by the congress of practices which take money from the treasury by indefinite or revolving-fund appropriations. The esti mates for the present year show that over a billion dollars of expenditures were authorized by the last congress in addi tion to the amounts shown in the usual compiled statement of appropriations. Specific Appropriations Urged. This strikingly Illustrates the Impor THE

The relation between the current receipts and current expenditures of the government during the present fis cal year, as well as during the last half of the last fiscal year, has been disturbed by the extraordinary burdens thrown upon the treasury by the transportation act, jn connection with the return of the railroads to private control. Over $600, 000.000 has already been paid to the rail roads under this act $350,000,000 during the- present fiscal year and it Is estimated that further payments aggregating pos sibly $650,000,000 must still be made to the railroads during the current year! It is obvious that these large payments have already seriously limited the government's progress in retiring the floating debt. Closely connected with this, it seems to me, is the necessity for an immediate consideration of the revision of our tax laws. Simplification of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. These taxes performed an In dispensable service during the war. The need for their simplification, however, is Very great in order to save the taxpayer inconvenience and expense and in order to make his liability more certain and definite. Other and more detailed recom mendations with regard to taxes will no doubt be laid before you by the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of internal revenue. Would Aid War Heroes. It is my privilege to draw to the atten tion . of congress for every sympathetic consideration the problem of providing adequate facilities for the care and treat ment of former members of the military and naval forces who are sick or disabled as the result of their participation In the war. These heroic men can never be paid in money for the service they patrioti cally rendered the nation. Their reward will lie rather In realization of the fact that' they vindicated the rights of their country and aided in safeguarding civili zation. The nation's giat'tude must be effectively revealed to them by the most ample provision for 'their medical care and treatment as well as for their voca tional training and placement. The time has come when a more com plete program can be formulated and more satisfactorily administered for their treatment and training, and I earn estly urge that the congress give the matter Its early consideration. The sec retary of the treasury and the board for vocational education will outline In their annual reports proposals covering medi cal care and rehabilitation which I am sure will engage your earnest study and command your most generous support. Permit me to emphasize once more the need for action upon certain matters upon which I dwelt at some length In my message to the second session of the 66th congress: The necessity, for exam ple, of encouraging the manufacture of dyestuffs and related chemicals; the im portance of doing everything possible to promote agricultural production along economic lines, to improve agricultural marketing and to make rural life more attractive and healthful; the need for a liw regulating cold storage In such a way as to limit the tlme-during which goods may be kept In storage, prescribing the method of disposing of them if kept be yond the permitted period, and requiring goods released from storage in all cases to bear the date of their receipt. Would Mark Storage Goods. It would also be most serviceable If it were provided that all goods released from cold storage for Interstate shipment should have plainly marked upon each package the selling or market prices at which they went Into storage, in order that the purchaser might be able to learn what profits stood between him and the producer or the wholesale dealer. In deed, it would be very serviceable to the public if all goods destined for Inter state commerce were made to carry upon every package case whose form made it possible a plain statement of the price at which they ltft the han-ls of the pro ducer. I respectfully call your attention, also. t' the recommendations of the mes sage referred to with regard to a federal license for all corporations engaged in interstate commerce. In brief the immediate legislative need of the time is the removal of all obstacles to the realization of the best ambitions of our people in their sev eral classes of employment and the strengthening of all instrumentalities by which difficulties are to be met and removed and Justice dealt out, wheth er by law or by some form of media tion and conciliation. I do not feel it to be my privilege at present to sug gest the detailed and particular meth ods by which these objects may be attained, but I have faith that the in quiries of your several committeeswill discover the way and the method. Asks for Loan to Armenia. In response to' what I believe to be the impulse of sympathy and opinion throughout the United States I ear nestly suggest that the congress au thorize the treasury of the United States to make to the struggling gov ernment of Armenia such a loan as was made to several of the allied gov ernments during the war. and I would also suggest that it would be desira ble to provide in the legislation itself that the expenditure of the money thus loaned should, be under the supervision of a commission, or at least a com missioner, from the United States, in order that revolutionary tendencies within Armenia Itself might not be af forded by the loan a further tempting opportunity. Allow me to call your attention to the fact that the people of the Philippine islands have succeeded In maintaining a stable government since the last action of the congress in their behalf and have thus fulfilled the condition set by the congress as precedent to a consideration of. granting independence to the islands. I respectfully submit that this condition precedent having been fulfilled, it is now our liberty and our duty to keep our promise to the people of those islands by granting them the Independence which they so honorably covet. I have not so much laid before you a series of reommendations, gentlemen, as sought to utter a confession of faith, of the faith in which I was bred and to which It is my solemn purpose to. stand by until my last fighting day. I believe this to be the faith of America, the faith of the nation, and of all the victories which await national action in the days to come, whether in America or elsewhere.

CONGRESS FLAWS TO AID BUSINESS Ways and Means Committee Prepares to Consider the Many Bills Presented. A WIDE RMIGE OF PROPOSALS Some Measures Provide for Investiga tions by Committees Which Are to Make Recommendations. Washington, Dec. 7. Congressional consideration of methods to aid in re storing normal business conditions appeared in the offing with announce ment that majority members of the ways and means committee would meet in legislative program with re spect to commerce and industry. The many bills dealing with farm ing and industry, presented, together with an apparent desire of leaders to do something for business general ly, made it appear certain congres sional attention would be turned to business problems, once appropria tion bills are out of the way. Con gressional leaders do not believe act ual enactment of any such legislation can be accomplished during the pres ent session, but they are evidently agreed that the foundations should be laid through committee consideration for prompt action after March 4. A Wide Range of Proposals. The ways and means committee will have before it a wide range of proposals for bills already presented, which include measures providing all the way from far-reaching tax and tariff reforms and agricultural relief to aid or protection to limited groups of industries. Some measures would direct con gressional investigation of unemploy ment. Among such measures was a resolution presented calling for house committee investigations and a conference of governors and federal officials to ascertain facts and fig ures and make recommendations. The resolution set forth that there now were more than 2 million unemploy ed in the United States. Permission to deduct income taxes paid this year from next year's as sessable income was proposed as a business relief measure by Represen tative Ackerman, Republican, New Jersey, who declared that the burden of taxes should not further be in creased by taxing money already paid or to be paid into the treasury. STIRS LEAGUE ON TYPHUS Delegate From Canada Appeals for Aid in Fighting Disease in Near East Countries. Geneva. Sir George E. Foster of the Canadian delegation, stirred the League of Nations assembly by an elo quent appeal for action against the typhus in Poland and the near East in general. Canada and Siam, he remark ed, were the only countries that had responded with cash contributions. "Let it not be said that the flood gates of sympathy are closed," he cried. "Let it not be said that the sensibilities of the world have been dulled to such imperative calls." A member of the Indian delegation, the prince of Navanagan, added to Sir George's appeal by giving a vivid de scription of the ravages of typhus in the East. He declared the world was facing in this a graver emergency than the situation in Armenia. Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian dele gate, said that the typhus could be effectively fought with the price of two torpedo boat destroyers. He pro posed the naming of a committee to get the money.

Several delegates said that what they feared would happen had happen ed; that the new world was arraying itself against the old world's ideals and ideas. Many well informed dele gates were admittedly alarmed, fear ing that the whole league structure built up out of the blood and agony of the war was crumbling away be fore their eyes. Honorio Pueyrredon, foreign min ister of -Argentina, . stands absolutely firm on the demands", refusal of which prompted him to hand to Paul Hy mans, president of the league assem bly, at 3:20 o'clock this afternoon, an official note announcing that his gov ernment had instructed him to an nounce its intention to withdraw from the league because of the assembly's rejection of Argentina's proposed amendments to the covenant. To a correspondent, M. Pueyrredon made this flat statement:. "What is the use of remaining in a league with an unsound foundation."

DELEGATE STIRS LEAGUE MEETING Canadtan Member Rebukes the Greedy Views of Repreent atives of Europe. PLAN 4 YEARLY CONFERENCES Action of Assembly Puts Hardship on Distant Members Would Give Old World Domination. Geneva. The liveliest motion the assembly of the league of nations has experienced was provoked recently by N. W. Rowell of Canada, who express ed his views regarding - European statesmanship in a way that startled diplomatists of the Old World. A sharp debate arose over the rec ommendation of the committee on technical organizations that the as sembly propose to the governments to set up under the auspices of the league three new organizations finances, transit and health with annual con ferences on these subjects. Mr. Rowell objected, on the ground that it was impossible for distant coun tries to send their best men abroad four times a year to attend the assem bly and the conferences, and declared that the result would be to throw these organizations under European in fluence. The assembly, he held, should occupy itself with these ques tions. Canada, at any rate, he said, felt that they were questions that should not be allowed to fall into European control. "Fifty thousand Canadian soldiers under the sod in France and Flanders is the price Canada has paid for Euro pean statesmanship," he cried, to the astonishment of the entire assembly and the dismay of some of the dele gates. Arthur Balfour and Mr. Fisher were plainly affected by the thrust from a British dominion; they remained mo tionless in their seats through the balance of the debate, with grave faces. Lord Robert Cecil, represent ing South Africa in the assembly, in a gentle way softened the blow by saying that he agreed with much that Mr. Rowell had said, but thought Mr. Rowell was mistaken in believing that the organizations would fall under the control of Europe. He could not go into a debate as to whether "Europe had made its way in the world." The assembly committee on the ad mission of new states recently decided in favor of admitting Luxemburg and Finland into the league of nations. The question of the admission of the Baltic states and Albania was put over for future consideration. FEWER CIVIL WAR PEHSIONS The Pension Commissioner Reports That Many Veterans of 1S61 Died During Past Year. Washington. Pension disbursements for the fiscal year 1920 aggregated $213,295,314, according to the annual report of Commissioner Saltzgaber of the pension bureau, just made public. The figures showed a decrease of about 9 million dollars from 1919 to tals and the report recorded the death In the year of 27,871 Civil War pen sioners, leaving 243,520 soldiers of that war on the pension roll, in addi tion to 290,100 Civil War widows. . While no survivors of the war of 1812 were shown, seventy-om widows of soldiers in that war are receiving government pensions. Only 148 Mexi can war survivors were reported and 2,423 Mexican war widows. Survivors of the world war do not show on the roll. Their dependents alone are carried, such as invalids, widows, minor children and mothers and fathers of regular army soldiers for the period prior to the application of war risk insurance legislation. NEW DEMANDS ON GERMANY Pari3. The reparation commission announced recently that Germany must deliver to France and Belgium 1,740,000 fowls within four years, 25, 165 goats within three years and 15, 250 pigs within one year. The Ger man representatives have agreed to this program. The commission also announced Germany has almost completed deliv ery of the livestock advances required under the peace treaty. Germany has been instructed to deliver within" six months 30,000 horses, 125,000 sheep and 90,000 cattle, including 30,000 in calf. The otal horses, sheep and cat tle to be delivered eventually will be fixed later. The allied demands are considered to be reasonable but the German representatives will be heard.

A decline ranging from 10c to 2ac per 100 lbs again brought hog prices at Chi cago to within 10c of these prevailing a. week ago and perilously near the $19 mark. Sharp declines on fat lambs brought the price down to a level witti those of a week ago: yearling steers $15.75: good beef steers $13.25: heifers $12: feeding lambs $11.25: ewes $3.25.
