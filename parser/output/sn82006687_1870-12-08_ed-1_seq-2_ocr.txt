To CORBXSI-O*t>rNTS.—A pOHte CV*Ttri- ; botion. entitled the “ Towny R'jtwWc" keen reeetreu *bJ will appear in oar next mdc. ~#. -■■ . Mia Fmrn.— A failure on the part of OH? upper mail to “come to time” is much too Ordinary an occurrence to provoke a paragraph from our pen. The thing ha* become chronic, and we now no more ex pect the time-table requirements of the Poet Office Department to he regarded in ; this locality than if no such silly regula tions were in existence. But a fai’ure of the upper mail to connect with our Pool Office at all, as was the case on Wcdnca- : day of last week, this we admit is some thing unusual and ought to he of importance enough to provoke inquiry, if nothing cite, ' to prevent tkia also from becoming ehron- j te. The contractor for this route may tell Mr. Creawell what he pleases, but we stand to it, that there was no freshet or whirlwind or tempest or explosion or ava lanche or earthquake between this point and Charlotte Flail on Wednesday of last week and that the failure in question is refers Lie to something els*. Not Pi.XASXO.--It is as true now as in the times of Undibras. that no thief ever fell the halter draw with gosl opinion of the law. That the Loyal leagues should he displeased with the recent srtion of the Anne Arundel farmers In this State is. therefore, quite natural. The tiling, in i fact, was to have been expected. The ( experience of mankind shows that pro scription has no fiercer enemy than the proscription!*! when it is himself and not 1 wmiic ether man who is “of the faction that is wronged.” But is intolerance infilled ! to, or has it a right to expect toleration ? To tolerate intolerance is to encourage and connive at intolerance. Hence, it is the , duty of enlightened men to proscribe pro- 1 •cription and hence again it is the duty of good men to proscribe the Loyal Leagues in our midst. The head and front of the Anne Arundel offending hath this extent, j no more. It is a weak invention of the j enemy, besides bring a falsehood, to as sert that the Anne Arundel fanners have proposed to proscribe laborers simpiv le -eanse of their connection with secret so cieties. If is not against such secret so cieties as the Masonic Order, Sms of j Temperance, Odd Fellows, etc , which 1 are known to be organised for charitable , or reformatory purposes, that the farmer* j of Anne Arundel have sot their faces, but against a sworn, secret, political, aggres sive and proscriptive league, blind in its following, foreign in its inspirations, men acing to the public peace and waring upon their best interest. This and this only is the secret society the membership of which the Anne Arundel jn'ople have denounced. ! Besides, what, after all, is the terrible “burglary” that is threatened ? Only this. If you continue your membership *of the Ijoysl Leagues, we won’t employ ! you. We know you have been told, that we can’t do without you. Possibly, wo can’t. Certainly, we mean to try. Any way, you have notice to quit, not leeausc you are republicans, but because you per- 1 siat in continuing your membership of a I secret, political, oath-bound organization 1 which we kelievo to be seditious and dan gerous in character and know to be in con spiracy against, and hostile to our best interest. If this is burglary, make the moat of it. This is aliout the sin and substance of the Anne Arundel programme. That the Baltimore Ameriatn should be displeased with it is, of fours', to lie re gretted. We suppose, however, it was not constructed with a view of deserving such distinguished approbation and that very little solicitude was felt during its , incubation about what the .tmmVmi might I think of it. Bo this as it may, and at the risk of drawing the displeasure of the Baltimore oracle of radicalism upon our own county, we say with Mr. Burke’s friend M Bristol, ditto, ditto, sir, to all that has been spoken by the preceding speaker And I further, we recommend the early forma tion in our own county of just such an or- j ganization as has been recently started on the Severn. Tua Prfsidrxt’s MxssAna.-JThe Pres ident'a message was sent to Congress on i Monday. We cannot undertake to-dav to give more than a abort synopsis of its contents. It is radical, of course, to the core tad intensely protectionist. The usual reference to “outrages” at the South is made, reeooatruelion complimented snd the payment of the public debt commend- * cd. Tbs President suggests that the Coi fed States shall buy up the Alabama claims aad superintend their settlement with Great Britain. “Oar depressed Com merce” is wade the subject of a short ref creßce, bat a panacea is promised at some later period sf the session, “for this evil.” The ftaaaeial policy of the government is still, it seems, far from perfect and the actioa of Congress Is invoked to make this matter better. The revenue reform move BMWt lads aa favor in the message nor iadeed nay ether measure of se sibic re form. Gnat is still Graal, a w<ak ves 00l that Camera sad scnrwr * are still steering. { The Inithtit* —lf the farmers of our county really intend to forego hereafter | the employment of sarh persons as are i banded against them in Loyal Leagues and refuse to gire them ap. it is high | time, we think, that they should he looh -1 ing to some source or other to supply the deficiency which is likely to he produced by this setion. It is not intended, we presume, to refuse employment to parties fortress rfiey hnrt foea members of these League*, but only to employ other labor in eases where parties persistently refuse to abandon them. To estimate the num ber of these m<diynant or to approximate it, is now, of course, pure guess work, bat it would be well enough for the fanner to ! be on the safe side snd make as liberal j outlays for obtaining foreign labor as be can afford. We have work and idle land enough for the employment both of our native and all the foreign labor we are likely to obtain, and hence there is little danger of crowding out either the labor ers who have stood by us in the past or j those who may honestly mean to stand by us in the future. An initiative move to procure new labo.* fur this eonnly we take to be of prime necessity in view of the j contingency stated above, and hence we give below the resolutions adopted by the Anne Arundel farmers ns an admonition and a guide to our own people. Delegates have already been selected to represent our county in the International Immigrant Convention which meets in Baltimore on Tuesday next, the 13th of December, in stant. What action the Convention may recommend, cannot now be forecasted with certainty, but as earnest, practical turn are known to be at the head of it, we feel (ourselves justified in asking quick and concurrent action by our planters on such ! measures as it may think advisable to re commend. i Whrrrns, It is the opinion of this Con vention that the w Ifare of the community imperatively calls upon the farm rs of Anne Arundel county to employ only such laborers as are not combined secretly against our interest and ignorantly against j their own. /.***,/< <./. That all law-abiding citizens, who hate the good of this community at heart, should d nounee by words ami acts those leaders who have been instrumental I in firming our pres nt labor* rs into? ert I societies, and endeavoring to create a feel j ing of eiuuit;. between our laborers and us, ! who are their natural protectors and friends. Particularly should those trhi'e Iradcrt be denounced, who have knowing ly, for their own sinister ends, deceived the igm rant dupes by promises and threats which they knew could never be fulfilled, for the purpose of riding into fat offices : through their votes and their money col j letted through the agcnces of secret socie i ties. Raul red, That for the purpose of sup plying any demand for labor which may arise in this connty, we urgently recom mend the landholders of Arundle County to form associations in each Flec tion District, and to employ an agent for | the priH'urcmeot of laborers. Raul ml. That it is expedent that such district associations bo organized without delay, and we recommend that the agents ; employed by them be selected as delegates 1 from this county to the Ftate Labor Con i vention which is to assemble in Baltimore at 12 o’clock on Tuesday, the 13th of De cember. Rt-ulred, That wo earnestly recommend J to the district associations that they cease i to employ any laborers who remain in af filation with the so-called leagues, and , that they especially discountenance those who have made themselves most conspic • uous in such leagues. Casualty From Firearms. — A black man, named Edward Hopewell, aged about 21 years, while gunning near the residence of Janies Norris in Patuxent district on Saturday last, was killed by the premature explosion of Lis gun. The circumstances as reported are, that the cock of Hopewell’s gun. being caught by some obstruction and pressed back while he was crossing a fence, fell, exploding the gun and lodging the contents in the , left side. The unfortunate man lived only a few seconds after the accident. Hope well. wc learn, was formerly a slave of James U. Thompson and bore a good char acter. Another warning within a mouth in regard to the careless handling of fire arms. Or it Circuit Cm ar—The December Term of our Circuit Court commenced on ! Monday last, but no business was transac ted on that day in consequence of the ab j senee of His Honor, Judge Ford, who ! had been detained in Charles by his judi i cial duties. Ou Tuesday, His Honor was on the bench and the bu-iiu ss of the term was commenced and is progressing as we write. No case of general interest has occupied the attention of the Court up to this writing. His Him. Judge Magruder arrived on Tuesday evening and was on 1 the bench on Wednesday. It is thought that the present session of the Court will not extend bey*nd to day. ————— • • - i ■ ■■ Another Concert.—The success which attended the recent Concert of the Color ed children at £t. John’s has induced Father Hamilton to get up a similar one for the benefit of the Catholic Chapel in Med- I ley’s Neck. This will come off at the; Chapel on Sunday, the ISth of December, instant. immediately after mass. Refresh ments will be provided fw the occasion. As the pr weeds of the Concert are to be applied to make certain greatly needed ’ improvements on the Chape), we bespeak | I a large attendant ou the occasion. l item am r yorrcEL Senmsia'e MeaTßtv.—Mewei.ScritenrfctV, \ Xn.

John’s Church, Patuxent district, on Sunday last, was well attended, we learn, and realized the band sonic sum of a 

SIOO, which it is in tended to apply to some improvements contemplated to be made on that church. The singing is represented to have been | very creditable fur amateur* and to have ! been well received by all who attended. There were a boat thirty voices in the con cert.

We learn | from it where political power is ebbing away, and whither the currents are drift i ing ami the tide rfting. The New England States will lose six members of Congress under the new ap- i portion men*. Tiny have twenty-seven j , now. and will then be entitled to only \ twenty-one. As three of these States, I however, have pretty large fractions. New England may perhaps get twenty-two. The old Middle States of New York, j , i New Jersey. Pennsylvania, and Ohio lose i live members. It will be noted that while | New York loses three, Pennsylvania keeps up to her present number. Thisdepreci- t ation of Now York, as compared with j Pennsylvania, is due somewhat to the fact i that a considerable body of the business men of New York city reside in New Jer- j scy and Connecticut. The sixteen former slaveholding States gain four members. This is owing to t! c i circumstance that all the colored popula- | . tion of those Stales is now included in the basis of representation, whereas, when the present number of members of Congress was fixed, only three-tilths of the slaves were reckoned. On the other hand."as to (he twenty-one free States, though a part of them gain seven members, certain others lose eleven, making a net loss of four. * trabiae Northwestern States, com mencing with Indiana, but not crossing the Rocky Mountains, gain nine motnb<‘rs. It is in this section of the I’nion that there has been the largest advance of population since 1860. Kadi of those nine States in ■ j creases its representation, except Indiana and Nebraska, which hold their own. The fourteen States lying in the valley of the Mississippi, and along the tributa ries of that river, gain six members. Tbe three States beyond the Rocky Mountains—Nevada. California, and Or- j cgnn —neither gain n-w b>sc, but maintain their present representations of five mem- ; hr, thus proving that that remote sec- j tion of the i'niou kec,* up with the aver- \ j ago growth of the other sections The sixt.cn Atlantic states lose eight i | members, while the twenty-one Western i and Southwestern States gain seven.— j 1 , South Carolina is the only State of the ; • former class which gains, she obtaining j one additional member because of the large i ■ number of her population set free under j ; the Thirteenth Amendment. Ohio is the ;' only State of the latter class whose rep ; resoutatiou falls off, she losing two mom- i bers. The old fourteen States which carried the country through the Revolutionary i War wilUtave eight members less under the census of this present year than were . allotted to them under that of 1860. i i These eight members will now be assign i ed to States which have entered the Cniou .! since the close of the struggle for indc -1 | pendenec. Of course it will be understood that the , States whose members of Congress will lx* 1 .; now diminished have not necessarily de ., creased in population during the past ten years, but only that their increase has not ! kept up with that of the other States Indeed, only two States show a positive falling off from the census of 18*30. name- Iv, New Hampshire, which loses 11,000, and Virginia. which exhibits a dwsr r ! of 10,000; while the aggregate of the in crease in the whole Union during that pe riod will be abmt eight millions, earry -1 tug the sum total np to nearly or quite 1 ; fortv millions. 1 fhese statistics show that within the ! past ten years, as in the previous thirty, ‘ i the course of empire in the Republic is ; steadily westward, or rather toward the j great central valley of the continent.— I However, because of the abolition of slave . ry it will doubtless be deflected somewhat r to tbe southward during the next decade.
