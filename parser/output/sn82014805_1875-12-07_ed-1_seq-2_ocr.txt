DEL., PE«'. ?■ 1*7* Tin- Seliool Appropriation. A question of nutl ority hes been rais ed between the City Council and the Hoard ef Public Education. TheCoun ( il, at its last meeting proposed to furn ish tho Board with SCO.OtO for the sup port of the public schools during the year 1876. $74,000. It will be seen by referring to the proceedings cf tho Board in another column that that body proposes to have the Courts determine whether the Conn, eil has the power to fir a limit to the school expenditures. As both bodies arc constituted of citizens anxious to have the burden of taxation reduced to the lowest possible rate there ought to be no difficulty in arriving at an adjustment of this matter. Both bodies ought to examine careful ly their proposed expenditures and re duce them to the lowest possible point.— " n this way a satisfactory solution of the (lueBtion raised in t he Board might read ily be reached. We have now it is said sufficient seating room for all the scholars that attend the schools. If this is true .t might be well to postpone the build ing of another school housefor a year. The Hoard had asked for out ly in ic iL is ™a -i Congress.— The proceedings of Con fess yesterday were of a routine and formal character. In tho House the Clerk called tho roll, and then tho gen tlemen named in the Democratic caucus meeting on Saturday were all elected. Mr. Kerr received 173 votes, and Mr* Elaine 10G. Mr. Kerr was » eorted to the Speaker's chair, and th«- oath ad ministered to him by Mr. W. D. Kelly, who is the oldest continuous member. The Clerk, Sergeant-at-Arms, Door keeper, and other officers were then elected. A brief discussion arose over the election of a member from Missisippi. Mr. Morey hold a certificate of electio :rom so-called Gov. AY. 1\ Kellogg, an W. B. Spencer one from Gov. McEnry. Mr. Wood moved that the case be re ferred to the committee on Elections. Mr. Blaine objected. Mr. Lamar said the Clerk had enrolled the name of Mr. Morey as he had a ï r. . i ja< ie light to do. Mr. Wood's motion was lost by ( ..yes 135, nays 13-1. Mr. Morey was s 1 von n and took liis seat. A committee was ..ppointed to inform the Senate that the Hous-e was organized.

But ;.e declares that they can be satisfac torily explained, and strongly asserts his nnocence. If this be true, why should r.e hesitate to vindicate himself in the presence of the Court in which he has been calumniated ? The Secretary of the Treasury tent his book of estimates to Congress yesterday forth»» fiscal year ending June20,lS77. Tho grand total cf appropriations called for it» $314,012,GOd, which is $4,C12,008 arger than for the proceeding year, The ten per cent, reduction iu all the er, Mass., commenced yesterday. No trouble is anticipated, though a number oi French families, un willing to surr Fall 1! mills ii oder, will 1» ire for th» form r homes in Canada. Tho e who eat « 'uba sugar are helping Spain to conquor the Cuban patriots. Thus ( 'uba exports to and sells in this ountry $100,000,000 of her products, and wesend to Cuba only $21,800,000 worth of manufactures. Mr. Kerr does not expect to announce u i« o»mmittees for some days yet, nor does he propose to give any indication of how they shall be constituted until he is prepared to announce them. Tennessee is having a shaft of coal cut from her mines 100 feet long, which is to be taken to the Centennial and set upon it« base making a column 100 feet bigh. The President's Message will be sent to Congress to*day. Court adjourned Yus f erday. No trace of Tweed's whereabouts lias been discovered yet. The latest theory of his escape is that he got on board ot a steam tug and was taken to the lirilish bark Clareandon, which has been chartered by his relatives to carry him away. The Clarendon cleared for Queenstown on the 14th ult., but is beleivcd to have been cru* ising in Longlsland waters waiting for the ex-"Boss." Thero was lately shown at the rooniK of the Society of Art, in London, a piec * of milk, "solidified by the Hooker pro cess," and weighing 100 pounds, and which "has been exposed to the ac ion of air for four years and three months,'* The Agricultural Gazette of that city »ays that "its quality was still so excel lent that in a few minutes it was de volved into good fresh butter." Strawber ie* were served at a dinner in Washington a few days ago. Who would not go to Congress? ^ A J. 

CHINESE -MONEY. '• China is a hard money country, und | the usual currency is copper cash, each of which represents about » mill, or 1.000 to the dollar. Between 1830 and I860 the dopper cash became scarce and high, and tier government of lle-en Foong, then Emperor, hit upon a happy expedi ent to make money plenty, by making c *.sh of iron, which was n cheaper mater ial than copper and more plenty. Ot i course they expected an iron cash with ! the Emperor's name ou it to bo as good as a copper cash ; but confidence, popu lar faith, i* a more necessary ingredient in a circulating medium tl an themator- 1 ial of which it is made, and, from the be ginning, a copper cash was worth.two of the iron, and, as tho iron multipliai and ! became pleury, its price went down till j in April, 1857, it took 6,700 iron cas 1 '. about one hundred pounds of iron, to make a dollar. Hanks sprung up to sup ply the deficiency of copper cash and del- , + uged tho country with bills. In a brief • space paper money became plenty, but its price decreased in the ratio of its multiplication, till it took three thou sand cash in bills to represent one thou sand in copper, the value of a dollar ; and in tho spring cf 1S58 a dollar commanded ten and twelve thousand cash in bills.— Rice became dear, business stagnated and a famine was imminent. Mobs arose, gutted the banks, assailed tho palace of the Viceroy, broke open the gate«, pulled his venerable eminence by the tail, and asked him why, while money whs so plen ty, rice was so dear. " To I Lav CHINESE AC HO EATS. j ofTlM-lr SnrprlMliif( Ffit* oCTmi they Risk Thrir Neck»* ami Holies. - I Says the San Francisco Call: To an American nothing can be more utierly ! incomprehensible and monotORous j than a Chinese play. Many go once] (j out of curiosity; but the outrageous I music of the orchestra, with its wail-1 ing, stringed instruments and discor- j dant gongs, intersperspersed with the horrible iargon of the Celestial, is rare-j ly sufficient to hold entranced the casual white spectator, when a free melodeon entertainment furnishes him ! with superior attractions. (If late, however the manager of the Chinese Theatre has introduced "new business," with the idea of securing pa tronage outside of that afforded by his o countiymen The Chinese tumblers! lately introduced into the Jackson Street Chinese Academy of Music are ! indeed marvels in their line, and the i performances are well worth seeing.— These acrobats do not appear alone, but are incidental to the piece, very' much as the circus scene is introduced in the play of Cld «lust before the appearance of the aero bats a Chinaman rushes down stairs to ic form those on the street that the tumbling is about to begin and there * is a rush directly from below. Amid ™a tremendous demonstration on the part of the orchestra the tumbling begins. A gigantic Chinaman comes out dressed in a grotesque costume in • which every known color is blended. He goes through a number of liourish and bows, which cause the unso phisticated portion of the audience to entertain the belief that he is a star performer. fact, as the man is only a figure head. At last a number of athletic Mongoli ans appear, stripped to the waist, and begin a sort of combat upon the stage. At erst th» fighting appears to be pro miscuous, but six or eight finally ally themselves against one man and try to overcome him by springing against him and striking him full in the breast with the soles ot their feet. He meets this curious mode of attack by standing like a statue, while the others full heavily upon the lloor. A number of , tables are next brought out and piled above the other until a height of , A pur* former whose weight is no less ihun 150 pounds, mounts them, and, spring ing in the air, toward the lioor and the stage, strikes both feet with a heavy thud unon the bare breast of aman standing about ten feet iron, the foot of the tables, throwing him violently to the floor. How a man can sustain col, n Glow is n nivsterv Airain the such a tnow is a nij stery. Again tut agile acrobat ascends to tile top table, and springing upwards, turns a soiner sault while all the tables except the ' ii ... , . . lower one are suddenly taken away. Upon the only table left lie falls with a force apparantly great enough to break every bone in iiis body; but lie leaps up again immediately aud turns back handsprings across the stage, Again lie climbs to tue to], of the tower of tables, while a second lies a table a tew feet from Hie j base of the lower. Turning a somer- ! sault in mid air he fails upon the other body, the tw o breast to breast, and bouuds off again with a second somer-; tault .Other acrobats climbed to vari oils attitudes and fell uppn the stage, j alighting square upon their backs with 1 a force which was astonishing. These feats are all (Xccated by men in a seminude condition, so that there is no I ehance tor pudding their clothes.— | While the Americans in the theatre applaud, the Chinese make no demon-1 stration ot approval, but sit looking stolidly on. The manager informed the Call reporter that llie tumblers are trained from childhood, and become habituated to the terrible concussions only by years of practice. He added that many are killed in training, or maimed for life. The reporter was allowed to examine the acrobats, and found the muscles of their hacks and breasts as hard as wood to the touch. None of their feats are graceful, but simply indicating a tremendous amount of nerve and endurance. -i l)ltliK-ll I ( B Such, however is not the f one about t wen tv feet is attained. of is to While a servant gill of a family living near Franklin, Mass., was hanging out clothes near the house, on n windy morn ing not long since, she saw gome twenty five cent notes flying in the ail. She did her best in scrambling for them, and suc ceeded in obtaining $23. Other persons near at hand, learning of the affair, suc ceeded in finding $20 more. The money was all fresh from tht Treasury, having never been in circulation before. Three hand* were found, two of them marked — having contained $50. There was a pile of boards near by, and it is supposed that the money had been stolen and placed there, and that the wind removed it from the place of concealment. A silver mine of excellent quality is reported to have been discovered at North Oxford, Mass. The ledge in which the vein lies has already been opened, and preparations have been made for cou inuing the work of mining. The vein is about sixteen feet below the sur face, and ore has already been found which yields enough silver to make min ing profitable. on to for * and ion city de in A M USEMENTS. ^ ' rand OPERA HOUSE A MIX.
