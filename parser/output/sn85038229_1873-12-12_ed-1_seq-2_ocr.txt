THE JOURNAL. A.. H.BAL3LET, Editor. ' FREMONT , OHIO. FRIDAY, December 1?, 1873. The Independence of Cuba is among the possibilities. f The inauguration of Governor Allen will take place on the 12th of January. Hon. Chas. Iostek, occupies a position on the Committee on Ways and Means. Pjendleton, of Maine, has return ed the ewag. He only found out be didn't want it on the 2Cth nit, II wanted to keep Thanksgiving tlay and couldn't keep both, so he return ed the hack pay. Dawis, Kelliy, Gabfielu, bco field, retain their old places on the Standing Committees of the House. Blaino has considered their services of too much importance to the coun try, to yield to the pressure for their removal. Hon. Martin Wklker has been chosen to fill the position made va cant by resignation of Judge Sher man, The appointment is a fitting one, and no one need fear that the judicial ermine will be soiled while worn by Judge Sherman s successor, The lessees of the Ohio Canals report that the years business oa the canals of the State has resulted in actual loss of many thousands ol douars, and that they will have to borrow money to make necessary repairs to be ready for spring navi gation. lu Board of rablic WorKs in making their report to the Govern or, say that a new bridge is needed over the Sandusky river, at FremoDt, on the W. R. & M. R. Yes, badly needed, and if the State will do its duty to its people, anew one will be built, the coming year. The Secretary of the Treasury's repot gives the total net expendi tures, exclusive of the public debt, at 1290,345,245. This is the appar ent expenditure of the government. The actual disbursements for the year, which are found by the deduc tion of repayments to appropriations in excess of expenditures, appear by the figures made up at the Treasury to be about $20,000,000 less, or $270, 633,327. Thk Virginius has not yet been surrendered, and the Spanish gov ernment now claims it is not obliged to surrender her before the 18th. An effort has been made by Spanish au thority to have the delivery changed bo that the vessel might remain in neutral hands until the matter of ownership could be determined. Our government insisted on the original agreement, and hence the claim that Spain was not obliged to make the delivery before the 18th. Thb House has passed a bill de claring general amnesty. The salary grabber Wood, who ,was the Demo cratic candidate for speaker of the House, voted aginst the bill. De xnocracy has all along been clamor ing for general amnesty, and when it was offered, their representative man voted against it. It 5s pretty hard work generally to find a Demo crat stick to anything but spoils, though they did stick pretty well to the rebel side of the question during the war. The strongest evidenc that the panic has spent 'itself, and reaction has set in, is given in the fact that mills in Pennsylvania and Massachu setts which suspended operations under the influence of the shock are resuming operations. The New Tork Times has reports from all the manufacturing districts of Pennsyi vania, and the Lowell Courier from points in Massachsetts, which main tain that such is the case. In the main, work has been resumed at a light reduction in the wages of la bor. The Constitutional Convention met on the 3d, but did nothing but get ready. On the 4th, the Judic iary article was considered and some progress made. On the 3tb, muoh time was spent on tbe subject of the official printing, which some mem bers wished to have done in Cincin nati. The free pass system, gift3, &c, from railroads consumed the bal ance of the day. The subject ot mileage, and county and township organizations occupied Monday, but the amount of progress made was insignificant. The New York World says, and it ought to be authority with Demo crats, that "No Salary Grabber is a Democrat." And yet every Demo crat in the House, except four, vot ed for Fernando Wood for speaker. Two of these only voted for Cox, who had repudiated the steal, while 77 voted for Fernando, who not only took but kept the grab, the increase salary, and still takes all he can get. The World's enunciation is Demo cratic in theory; Fernando's course, and the course of those voting for him, is Democracy in practice. The people will recognize a slight differ ence. Notwithstanding the strong back ing which Mr. Creswell has obtained for his postal telegraph and saving bank schemes, public sentiment is trongly set sgainst them. The Cin cinnati Gazette ma,kes this tellintr hit: b Th business of the public mails is verv large. A good business man can find a treat field for the excise of his talents in improvine its details. It lacks the energy, reliability mud adaption to the popular wants, -which id seen in the management of the teleprapb and express. If Itx. Creswell oould devote his am buion to doing well the work which the (rov nuaant ha already it hands, instead of loos: ing abroad to grasp business which is now much better done than his own, and if he could be content to be a Postmaster General instead of aspiring to be a financier, he would fee a valuable government officer. to The Presidents message has met with very geaeral commendation! Its recommendations are all that could be desired upon financial t.nd legislative questions, and if Con gress puts a few, of them in good Bhape, it will but do a duty which the people expect. In regard to the Virginius and Cuba, his announce ment of the settlement of the difficul ty between our goverment anil Spain, was hailed with pleasure, although doubts of the ability of Spain to en force obedience to its mandates ob tained, especially as the Cubans manifested a warlike disposition, and determination to resist the surrender of the Virginius. Latest report?, however, indicate that the Cuhars have about spent their energy and will not oppose the delivery. The Cincinnati Qnzelte makes the following reference to a precedent which may possibly be followed bv Spain in hor treatment of the Virgin ius, for if accidents happen in the bes', regulated Government,why not under Spanish rule? Tb Republic of Spain has screed to delivr np the filibuster steamer f'irpiniu. This re calls providential accident that happened in a similar case. The rebel iteamer Florida had committed very exasperating depredation! on oor merchant ships with Ion impanitj: To oar naval officer! it wu aggravating to see her lying safely and defiantly in neutral ports. Finally ous of oor ships seized her in a port of Brazil, and brought her to Hampton Roads. Of course it was a violation of ths jurisdiction ot Brazil, and of course npon the requirements of Brazil our government ogreed to deliver her up. But during thep'rdingof this sgr.erocnt, somehow, through awkward mannjjemc.it, or something, one oi ur government transports collided with the Florida and sunk her. As our apolopy nd agreement to give her up had satisfied te dignity of Brazil, and a tbe sink ing of the Florida made it impossible to deliv er her until we had fiiied her up ay in, the natter ended there. Such a provideiiUat acci dent may happen again. Congress On the 3d the House admited Geo. L. Smith, of Louisiana, o a seat On the 4th appointed a committee to report a bill to repeal the salary bill, and all bills present ed on the subject were referred. Cox and Ncgley had a little "set to" on the subject. Various important bills were introduced. On the 5th the standing committees were ap pointed, and numerous bills referred On the 8th a bill to remove all disa bilities from persons who had been engaged ia the rebellion passed, 141 to 29. The resolution of Cox to re cognize Cuban belligerency Was re jected 44 to 153. Committee reported bill to repeal the Salary law, made special order for the next day. On the 9th bill to redeem the loan of 1858 in coin was passed, and a spicy debate took place on the Sala ry repeal bill. In the Senate on the 3d but little was done aside from introducing bills On the 4th bill to redeem the loan of 1858 was passed, and the standing committees were elected, when an adjournment till Monday took place. The 8th was taken up in introduc ing and referring bills." On the 9th, Morrill, of Vermont, introduced an important bill for the resumption of specie payment, and free banking, and Buckingham called up his bill for a similar purpose. Wi take great pleasure in exhaust ing the reports from Spain and Cuba and the prospective war, and the na val preparations and coast .defences fcc., for they are so deliclously clear that we have no trouble whatever in making out just exactly what is to be done and what is to be expected There is just one little trouble about it, however, and that lie3 in the fact that while each day's report is clear and lucid, each day's repoit differs from its predecessor, and no matter how well you may understand the matter, it is stil' kind of muddlesome Just for instance: Havana and th rest of Cuba was in a blaze of war valor, her merchants were going to buy war vessels and fight it out on their own hook, with the United States and the home Government, if necessary. That an intense war spirit was developing in Spain, where the President's message waa regard ed as too much "sarse for the gan der," and that there was to be crises in the Spanish Cabinet be cause Castelar was too servile; and to mix the matter more, Sickles was going to resign because Fish "cu him out" and seUled matters with Castelar through the Spanish minis ter, without as much as "by your leave, sir?" Then, just as we are look ing for more blood and thunder, along comes tbe assurance that the Cuban blood had gone down several degress, and because they have dls covered that President Grant's mes sage smelled sulphurous, they were willing to give up the Virginius, Then Spain would have the Virgini us taken to that country, deliver her over to our authorities, and put in claims for damages to vessels. Then againg we are assured that Captain General Joveller cannot or will not deliver over the Virginius, as agreed, and Spain indicates her inability in- ferentlly to compel obedience. And so tue reports go, definite and yet uncertain, clear yet unreliable. Sumner's Bill to supply the Place of Legal Tenders. give below the text of Sum ner's bill to replace the legal tender circulation with compound interest notes. The intention may be well enough, and for a time the plan may work well enough, but 'f adopted, it cannot help but operate as a means of contraction whenever the interest due npon them amounts to sufficient to justify holding, unless the public should be obliged to estimate interest whenever the notes pass from hand to hand. Such a plan might work, if provided as a means of promoting the elasticity of our currency, by al lowing an exchange for compound interest notes when currency is abun dant, and an exchange for currency, when the supply is not ample. That, however, we think, would be better provided for under the suggestion of the President in regard to the issue and redemption of bonds : Beit enacted, etc. That the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed prepare for circulation compound interest notes, equal in a mount to th rtnviitnnHinCT ls , gal Under note and fractional currency of the I United States, and in all respect similar to those heretofore issued wider the act approv ed March 3d, 183:i,entit!ed. "An act to provide ways aud means for the support of the Gov ernment." Bee 2. That these notes of different denom inations, to the amount of ? '20,000,000, shall be dated oa the first day of each month, commen cing with the first day of July next ensuring, when the amount named shall be ready for is sue, and then afterward on tbe first day of each month until the requisite amount has been furnished. See. 3, That the notes thus provided shall be naid out for ail disbursements of the Trsu- ury, except those due in coin, so long as they are sufficient for the purpose, and if the whole monthly instalment is not thus disposed of, it shall be the duty el the Secretary of the Trea sury to exchange the surplus for the present legal tender notes.so far as practicable, that the full sum of 20,000,000 may be put into circula tion each month. Sec 4. That it shall be the duty of the Sec retary of the Treasury to cause the destruction each month of legal tender note to an extent equal to ths notes issued under this act. Seo. 5. That the notes issued nnder this act act shall, at the option of the holder, be convertible at the end of two years, in sums of $100 or it multiple, into bonds of the United States not havemg less than 10 nor mora thsn 40 years to run, aud bearing interest at the rati of fiv per centum; and the Secretary of the Treasury is now hereby authorized to issue such bonds. Sec. 6. That whenever these notes, or the bonds into which they may be converted, can be sold at par in gold, the Secretary of the Treasury may sell tliem in such sums as may be called for, and apply the proceeds in gold to cancel legal tender notes as they are paid into the Treasury. Sec 7. That the notes issued under this act shall constitute no part of the legal currency reserve required of the National banks. Thursay's Storm. Cincinnati, Dec. 5 Advices from the surrounding country show that damages to houses, fences, dec, from the late gale, were considerable. At Dayton, Ohio, a large brick bniiding. one hundred end fifty by fifty feet, fonr stories high, occupied by a screw factory, was razed to tbe ground. The structutre was a sub stantial one, the walls being eighteen inches thick. The damage is esti mated at ten thousand dollars. Rett & Peregrin'.' machine shop was blown down. Also a number of wood en houses and sheds, in different parts of town, were blown down. In the country near Dayton, long lines of fenees were leveled. One large barn was moved several feet from its foundation. Mrs. Hall's barn, Eaton Pike, was completely demolished, and for half a mile, at one pont, all tne rences were blown down. A frame cottage was blown from one side of the pike to the other. At Laurel, Indians, houses were blown down and many unroofed, and a great amount of damage was done. A car was blown off of a side track near Fort Wayne, on the Wabash Railroad, and the fast train ran into it. No one was injured. Toborto, Dec. 5 A terrific gale passed over Ottawa yesterday. Sev eral churches and many dwellings were unroofed and a number of buildings prostrated. The los3 by the recent storm here and in the vi cinity will probably reach $100,000. Reports from various points in the East, West, North and Northwest, in dicate that the storm was of a most destructive character. Chicago, Dec. 5 Reports from business points througout the West state that considerable damage was done to rirocertv by the storm of Wednesday night, many miles oi fencing being blown down, trees up rooted, &"C. 

NEWS ITEMS. Thirty-six deaths in Cleveland last week. , Colonel Lewis Zahm has sold his farm of 140 acres on the Ridge road toMonroeville.to W. L. Latham, for $105 per acre. A half-breed girl, said to" be the daughter of William JUowry, o Pittsburz, is announced as heiress to about $2,000,000. Twenty-one bills to repeal the increase of pay, were introduced in the house on the 4th. Did any body vote for the increase There seems to be a disposition in the present Congress to curtail appropriations for internal improve ments to the lowest possible points, Toledo had an influx of visitors last week, and tbe residents along the line of the Eel River Valley Railroad, enjoyed the occasion very much. Ingersoll, one of Tweed's partners has been sentenced to penitentiary forefive years. Harrington, another partner, has been sent up for eighteen months. The activity at tbe Navy Yards continues, notwithstanding tne V lr cinius is to be delivered over. Pos sibly when that is done the activity will cease. Three indictments have been found against W. S. Hickox, President of the First National Bank of Mansfield, for embezlement, by the Grand Jury of Richland county. General Fremont has a cancer of the stomach, but has, until lately kept the matter a secret from his fam ily and friends. His physician says that he cannot live a year. Rev. J. B. ForbuBh, of Cleveland, takes the grounds that church prop erty should be taxed, and on Sunday evening last preached a sermon on the subject sustaining that position ably. The Loch Erne officers don't think highly of the courageous behavior of tbe officers of tne V lllle uu Havre, but think the great loss of life was occasioned by cowardice and met- ficiency. BishoD Cummins who notified his withdrawal from the Episcopal church, has organized what is called the Reformed .Episcopal church, and Bishop Cheney of Chicago, has been chosen a Bishop in it. The Supreme Court of New York has decided that a man can pick all the fruit from a tree growing on his own land, though it hang over on neighbors land. The question is an old and oft disputed one. Cant Hall's death is still a subject of speculation. The latest is that friends of the mntiseer whom Hall had shot in a previous expedition, enlisted in the last, and were in some way responsible for his death. A Cleveland girl of good family and well educated, having left her home, was traced to Reading. Pa., where she was found in house of ill fame. She was induced to return home. She was known as Clara Bell, in Reading. A Paris dispatch says the resig nation of Minister Sickles was based on the fact of the Washington gov ernment negotiating directly with Spain and overlooking him. He claims the government failed to protect him. Six miles south of Bucyrus, Satur day, a little son of Benjamin stump, aged 5 years, while watching men at work placing rings in hogs' noses, was terribly lacerated by an old sow which became infuriated. The boy's recovery is doubtful. - Two female convicts in the Pen itentiary attacked one of the female guards, on Monday last.naraed Miss Finney, an would have killed her bnt for the interposition of a third convict was Adahel Gentz, of Toledo. One defaulting bank cashier has been punished. Fkank L. Taintok, late cashier of tb e Atlantic Bank, New York, embezzled and squandered $400,000 of the funds of the Bank, for which he has just been sentanced to Penitentiary for seven years. "The Church of God," so called, founded by John Winebrenner, is a denomination of Bsptists.numbering about' 30,000. They are Evangelical in their doctrines and open comu nionists in practice and they have adopted the system of itinerancy. Mrs. Sears, who lives in Grayson County, Ky., went out one day last spring to dig ginseng. She is said to be one of the most industrious women in all her section. During the day she dug seven pounds of gin sing, killed five young foxes, two rattlesnakes, slew two fawns, and went back home and gave birth to twins. On Friday certificates were filed incorporating the Findlay Mafufact uring Company, to-manufacture ma chinery, $30,000 capital; the Tiffin Shoe Factory, with $GO,000 capital ; the American Low Water Alarm In' dicator Company, of Cincinnati, with $100,000 capita.1; the Fausler Manu facturing Company, of Cleveland, to manufacture gas lamps and fixtures, with $30,000 capitalO and the Del phos Brewery, with $30,000 capital. The spectators present at the meeting of the Hoosac tunnel shafts, according to the Boston Pout correspondence, behaved like wild men when the final blast opened the hole through the mountain. They made a rush for the opening, but one of the workmen, brandishing a pictc axe, could be herd to shout amid the din of voices. "Stand back! Walter Shanley is the first man to go through the hole!" The conductor, however, politely passed a State official and a reporter belore him. The Thief who was arrested for robbing Parsons' store in this tows, was found to have a quantity of Aycr's Hair Vigor in his possession. When asked why he wished to steal that article, he answered that lie "wanted to restore his hair, for it was hard to be a thief and bald, too." If that invention of the great chemist could restore a faded character as effectually as it does their natural beauty to bald and gray heads, it would surely be, as they say it now is, truly invaluable. Lewiston (Me) Journal. The nomination of Judge Wei ker was confirmed on Monday, and he entered upon the discharge of his official duties in this City yesterday, We are sure that the hearty welcome which he met from the Bar of Cleve land, is fully sympathized in by the Bar of this portion of the District We are also confident that the Cleve land Bar, in asking retention of Earl Bill, Esq., as Clerk, reflects the feel ings of all parties interested in the business of the Court. Very few offl cers have in so large a measure gained the confidence and respect of those having official intercourse with him. One of the attacking party —Toledo Commercial. At St. Louis, on the 4th, a wedding party was broken up by three men one an uncle of the bride. They suddenly entered the house, ordered the party disperse, and in the melee Richard Bolticher the groom, was shot in the leg. After his wound was dressed he returned to the house, and next day the three men returned and asked to see Bolticher but were refused. Bolticher left the house and ran, followed by the men, when young Cronenbold, a brother of the bride, fired lour or nve shots at mm. three of which entered his body one piercing his heart and causing instant death. Cronenbold was ar rested and locked up. It was evi dently a premeditated murder. As a precedent for the guidance of our Government should Spain prove unable to comply with her agreement, a similar case is cited in which Great Britain and Spain were the parties interested. It occured in the days of the Inquisition, when England made & demand on Spain for the release or some of her sub jects. Spain replied that they were held by the Inquisition, and she could, not control that body. "Then we will make war on the Inquisition," said John Bull. In commenting np on the President's Message,the Lon don Times takes the position that Spam must show real as well as nom inal control over Cuba, and that England will unreservedly support any policy calculated to require the exercise of such power or the aban donment of all pretense of authority over the Island. mere is a nice state ol anairs in Butler county in this State. It be ing suspected by the County Com missioners that there might be some irregularties in the county finances, they employed General Godman, ex Auditor of the State, to examine in to the books, and lo! it appears that the present county auditor has drawn from the treasury for three and a half years service $19,400 more than he is entitled to, and that all the other county officrs have been doing the same thing, the total over-draft amounting to about $30,000. Mr. Godman is now investigating the ac counts ten years back, which makes a great fluttering among the ex-au ditors, treasurers and other officials of Butler county. Butler is a high toned old Democratic county, giving a Bourbon majority of about two thousand at each election. This must, therefore, be another case of seduction. Ye Olden Times. Recently, while on a visit to Elmore, A. . Rice, of this city, came a cross a quantity of old paper belonging to Moses Boggs, which he has permitted ua to examine. They are mostly papers of Ezekiel Lamed, and as they cover a great portion of his life, and a period embraced between 1778 and 1810, commencing when the corntry was a dependency or England, and closiug filer Ohio had been admit ted to the Union, we make extracts, which we have no doubt wi'l be read with pleasure. The first is a bond given to secme the payment of a sum of money, dated Oct. 17, 1772, and of even date therewith is a mortgage, given as collateral security, upon a tract of land in Rindge, County of Cheshire and Province of New Hampshire. . It is given by Ezekiel Lamed 'o George Jeffrey. The bond is quite old and worn, bat legible, while the mortgage, though torn and yellow vt 1th age, can be easily read, and is written in a beautiful hand. The next paper is one which exhibits a slight dif ferent e In the method of doing business from what prevail at the present. It is as follows, verbatnm: December ye 6 i 779, t hen received a Cow of Eze- k'el Larned, for which I promise to return the same cow or a nother as good at the end of one year aDd thirty wait ot good Du-tcr tor tbe nee ot said cow. Yf said Cow dves by sickness or any acsadent I promise t do what ia customary yn such case, as witnes my nana, ienjamm itouiu. On the back of that paper Is this endorsement: Rockingham 1760 then reckned with Benjamin Oould and fonud due me from Mr. Gould XI. 10 aud M. The use of tbe Cow ys reckned til last fall, the time Mr Gould tuck ber. Uext follows, in 178S, a certificate showing that Ezekiel Larned and John Train had purchased original right to land The above evidently transpired while Ezekiel was a young man, but the next shows that an in teresting crisis In his affairs had arrived. It is dated Claridon, September ye 6, 1783, thiB maysarttiy that Ezekiel Larned aud Joannah Meant was .Law ful cried by me, Stephen Arnold, 'i own L lem. A few days later Is an order from Mr. Lamed tor a deed necessary for the settlement of some business entrusted to him by a friend before dying. But the next paper is one which would be regarded as rath er singular now-a-days: Claridon Oct S 1788 I For value reed Mr Zeacal Larned be pleased to 50 pay unto Judcdlah Clark seven sailings and six pence in money, unless Mr Clark is a mind to take it in anything else And this order is your dis charge from yooc bumble Servant Win Rice Soon aftor the above Mr. Larned must have "moved West," for In Jan. 1788, we find by a paper dated at Portsmouth (evidently Ohio) that he de posits 27 pounds, in New York currency, to secure the payment of 7 pounds, 1 shillings and 6 pence. Horses, in those days were not as valuable as they are now, as we find by the following: I hsve sold to Ezskial Lamed a bar hone, fifteen hands high, eleven years old, and a gray mare fourteen and a half hands high, both marked W. D., for thirty-five bushels com to be delivered in Cincinnati by the 19th Inst Matt Ernst for isov, , 17 i. wm Dean Thirty-five bushels com would not go a great way toward purchasing a single horse now. In February 1797, a frisnd of his seems to have been effected a little like people have been since the panic set in, and makes afi earnest demand for money. February 5, 1797 Sr. please to nav the bearer hendnev weaver the sum of two pounds on my acompt and in so doing yon will obleage your friende ueorge nnoz I Cannot Do without it To Mr Ezekiel Lamed We next find Mr. Lamed before a justice giving testimony ia a hog case, but we will let the jus tice s record tell how It was:. On the twenty ninth day of July one thousand seven hundred and ninety-three, before me William Goferth, one of the Justices assigned to hear the peace in and for the County at Hamilton, in the Territory of the United States Northwest ef the river Ohio. Dersonallv aDDeared Ecekiel Lamed. who beiog duly sworn on the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, depose th and saith that sometime in tbe fore part of last winter, as he was passing through the Garrison, as it is called, at Morris town, he heard John Webb speaking respecting some hogs that had been killed over tne Little Mi ami river, and he, that is Webb, said it was sus pected that Robt Mac Tenny had killed them, and he believed it was like enough for he bad a broth, er up the river who was a damd hog thief, that bad been catcht marking people's hogs: and further this deponent n saith not. Sworn to the day and year above written, before me niiiiam uocorui j. r. In the following month he conclude to open to Inn, and applies to tbe August Session Hamilton Co., ss., for a License to do so, at his bona In Co lumbia in said county. Taxes in those day were not so much of an item as they are in these days, s witness the following: Rec'd Cincinnati 4th Dec 1797, of Mr Ezekiel Larned forty three cents, and twenty-five cents for a warrant, the amount of Sarah Baker's tax for tb year 1797, by order of Robert Banliam, Esq,., on ut luo vuutuiiBsiuuers iiir nainutOD loamy John K. Ran Acting Clerk for the Commissioners warrant it On the Id day of April 1810, (Mr. Lamed having deceased) Deriah Lamed was appointed Adminis trator of his estate. There are other papers, but what we have given cover a period of 88 years, commencing at a time when what i now known as Ohio was an almost unbroken wilderness, ere the straggle for independ ence had commenced. During that period the wai had passed and the British grasp had been forced from the throats of the Colonies. The Colonial Government had sprung into existence and pasted away, and the present government had been instl tnted. Washington and Adam and Jefferson bad served their respective term a President, and Madison was in the second year of his first term. Mighty changes had taken place between th date of the first and last named documents, but nothing to what has since occurred. Ohio has grown to be the third State in the Union, and what remained of the "Territory North-west of the Ohio," has blos somed into populous State. Where the Indian trail was the only connecting liok between import ant posts, pikes have succeeded, forests have dis appeared and cities and towns sprung into being, roads and railways traverse the country in all direc tions, and communications are made in a day which at that time consumed months. The change ue mulJtudinons, and conraaing when viewed in the light of the past, and these old papers naturally cal's np the contrast.
