"Cox'a circus," is the way some newspapers put it iu speakiug of the Ouiteau trial. Oen. Sherman's wife's mother nd Secretary Blaine's mother, are titters. Fred K. Frelinghysen has been appointed by President Arthur as Secretary of State, vice Mr. James G. Blaine. . The mourning drapery in the halls about the Chamber of Repre sentatives, Washington, has been removed. A new pen-green Wilton earpet has been laid on the floor of the Chamber. The New York Tiibuno says that the proposition for an Ant Bourbon movement iu Texas 6hows how rapidly the Solid South is crumb ling away. South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Texas willbe taking their places with Virginia in the "Anti" column before many years have passed away. The New York Tribune thus closes an article on the outlook in Ireland: "The secret agents of the Land Leaguo are doing what they can to support Conservative declamation. The tenants are re fusing to pay rent and defying the landlordsto turn them out. Murder, arson, mutilation of cattle and all forms of agrarian outrage are com mon. Any peaceable tenant in the most troublesome districts who ven tures to pay his rent like an honest man exposes himself to a visit from "Captain Moonlight'' and a band of marauders, and the local juries will acquit every prisoner who is convicted of an agrarian outrage. A less courageous statesman than "TSLt; Gladstone would view the gen :eral prospect in Ireland with af 1 "bright. Bnt he has fatfh in moral as well as physical work. lie be lieves that party intrigues and Irish prejudice autf lawlessness can be fiually overcome. As has been already stated, great redactions have recently been made in the expenses of the Star Route service. The investigations of the Department of Justice and the Post Oflice Department have resulted in the- presentation of indictments 4 against persons formerly counected with that service, accusing them of offences against the Uuited states. I have enjoined upon the officials who are charged with the conduct of the cases on the part of the- Gov ernment, and upon the eminent counsel who, before my accession to the Presidency, were called to their assistance, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost rigor of the law all persons who may be found charge able with frauds upon the Postal Service. - Extract from President Arthur's Message. On last Friday, at Nashville, John J. Vertrees shot. Senator Smith, of Fentress county, in the left shoulder, in the rotunda of the Maxwell Mouse The wound is not fatal. Vertress had in a case iu court charged Senator Smith with bribery and corruption in voting lor the State Debt bill during the last reg ular session of tho Legislature. In the Senate, on tho 9th. Seuator Smith denounced Vertrees as a liar, and upon the adjournment of the Senate Vertrees sought him at tho Maxwell House and shot him. Sen ator Smith claims that ho was taken nnawares. Ho states that he was seated reading a newspaper, when Vertrees approached and tired at him without giving him any warn ing." Vertrees's friends assert that Senator Smith was in the act of ris ing and drawing a pistol when Vertrees shot him. An appalling calamity has bo fallen the American people since their chosen Representatives last met in the halls where you are now assembled. We might else recall with unalloyed content the rare prosperity with which through out the year the Nation has been blessed. Its harvests have been plenteous, Its varied industries have thriven, tho health oi its people have been preserved, It has main tained with foreign Governments the undisturbed relations of amity and peace. For these manifesta tions of his favor, we owe to Him who holds our destiny in His hands the tribute of our grateful devotions. To that mysterious exorcise of His will which has taken from us the loved and illustrious citizen who was but lately tho head of the Na tion we bow in sorrow and submis sion. The memory of his exalted character, of his uoble achievements and' of his patriotic life will be treasured forever as a sacred pos session of tho whole people. I he announcement ot his death- drew from foreigu Governments and peo ples tributes of sympathy and sor row which history will record as signal tokens of the kinship of na tions and tho federation of mau kind Extract from President Ar thur's Meswac. OUR 

WASHINGTON LETTER. Washington, D. C, ) Dec. 10th, 1881. f Editor Herald and Tribune: Tho Aires have doubtless been ahead of mo in announcing to your readers the glad tidings that the South has beeu recognized in tho organization of tho House of Rep resentatives of tho United States, by the election of Colonel Walter P. Brownlow, of your town, to the oflice of Door-keeper. This well de served compliment is a matter of congratulation to. Southern men generally and to the citizens of Tennessee particularly. It proves that our Northern brethren have discovered that the policy of keep ing Southern Republicans out in the cold fs not a good way to build up a strong following in tho South, and that a new and moro liberal policy will be inaugurated. Of course you will understand that this change was not brought about by a happy' operation ot Nature It took work, hard, untiring, patient, skillful work, and the men who brought the change about are en titled to the lasting gratitude of their fellow.citizcns. I refer to the Republican members of Congress from the South, mentioning among the number such stalwart Republi cans as Houk, Pettibono and Moore of our Stale, L'rner, of Mary land, Hubbs, of North Carolina, aud others. Now that the entering wedge has been firmly lodged, it will not be many days before Southern Re publicans will stand on an equal footing with their Northern breth ren in tho matter of public patron age. Col. Brownlow's position is by no mcaii8 a bed of roses. Although but four days in oflice his rotund form is "growing small by degrees and beautifully less." The cares of the office weigh heavily upon him. He had about 130 appointments to make and about ten applications for each position. The result is that he is besieged from "early morn to dewy eve'' with visitors, all pleading for oflico. It is in vaiu that he as sures them that he must apportion his appointments among tho 148 Republican Congressmen who voted for him, that he can not appoint personal friends, that the oflices be long to the party and not to him. They will not believe, they come with petitions a mile long, with tearful faces, with outstretched hands. Some of4them tell tales of distress that would melt a heart of stone, yet ho cannot help them. Just picture all this to yourself and you may possibly have some faint idea of what an ordeal he is pass ing through. The President's Message has met with universal favor. It is pro nounced the most sensible and business-like document of the kind ever presented to Congress. The people arc gradually coming to the conclusion that the man who bore himself with such refined dignity during the critical period iu our history, when our late President lay dying in tho Capitol, will not disappoint the expectations then formed of him, that ho will give the country an ad migration that Americans may well feel proud of. It is too early to predict anything as to tho legis'ation of the present session. The apportionment bill will probably be the most important measure to engage immediate at tention. An effort will also bo made to pass some law that will secure an honest ballot and a fair count in Southern States. In this connec tion it may bo well to mention that a prominent Southern Congressman is beiug pressed for the Chairman ship ol the committee on Privileges and Elections. It tho movement succeeds woe to the "bulldozer.'1 Dr. P. II. Prince, of Gallutin, will probably bo appointed postmaster of that town in tho course of tho uext week. Harry Griscom, of Chattanooga, is making a hot fight for General Wiider'8 placo. Arch Hughes is mentioned in connection with tho Columbia post office. The Memphis post office will soon pass into other hands. It is not yet known who will bo the lucky mau. Pick. The importance of timely legis lation with respect to the ascertain ment and declaration of the vote for Presidential Electors was sharply culled to the attention of the peo ple more than four years ago. It is to be hoiied that some well defined measure may be devised before an other National election, which will render unneocessury a resort to aiiv expedient of a temporary character for the determination of questions upon contested returns. Extract from Pn-tidenr Arthur's Message. On December 11th, the stables of tho Atlanta Street Railruad Com pany, at Atlanta, Ga, were de stroyed by fire, 2'W mules being burned. For many years, tho Executive, in his annual message to Congress, has urged tho necessity of stringent leg islation for the suppression of polyg amy in the Territories, and especially in the Territory of Utah. The exis ting statute for the punishment of this odious crime, so revolting to the moral and religious sense of Christen dom, hns been peisistently and con temptuously violated ever since its enactment. Indeed, in spite of com mendable efforts on the part of thp authorities who represent the United States in the Territory, the law has in very rare inxUnces been enforced, and for a cafcJTto which reference will presently fce made, is practically a dead lettei. The fact that adhe rents of the lormon Church, which rests upon polygamy aa its corner stone, have recently hjen peopling in large numbers Idaho, Arizona, aud other of our Western Territories, is well calculated to excite the liveliest interest aud apprehension. It imposes upon Congress and the Executive the duty of arraying against this barba rous system all the power which under the Constitution ml laws they can wield for its destruction. Reference hiis le?n already ma d to the obstacles which tho United States ofiicers have encountered in their efforts to pu'iish violations of law. Prominent among the obstacles is the difficulty of pro curing legal evidence sufficient to warrant a conviction, even in the fse of the most notorious offenders. Your attention is called to a recent opinion of the Supreme Court .of the United Stftes explaining ts judg ment of reversal iu tho case of iMiles, who had beeu convicted of bigamy in Utah. The Court refers to th fact that secretely attending the celebration of the marriages in thct Territory makes the proof of poly gamy very difficult, and the propriety is suggested of modifying the law of evidence which now makes a wife incompetent to testify agaiust her husband.vThis suggestion is approver1. I recommend also the passage of iin act providing that in the Territories of the United States the fact that a woman has been married to a person charge! with bigamy shall not dis qualify her as a witness upon his trial for that offence. I further recom mend legislation by which any per son solemnizing a marriage in any of the Territories, shall be required, under stringent penalties for neglect or refusal, to file a certificate of such marriage in the Supreme Court of the Territory. Unless Congress may devise other practicable measures for obviating the difficulties which have hitherto attended the efforts to sup- Sress this iniquity, 1 assure you of my etermined purpose to co-'. perate with you in any lawful and discreet meas ures which may be proposed to that end. Extract from President Ar thur's Messaep. Winston, Foiisyth Co., N. C.
