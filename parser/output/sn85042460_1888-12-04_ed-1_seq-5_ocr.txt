Chairman Holland, of the committee, appointed to investigate the blackballing of candidates or membership, reported that nine out of sieve; candidates were descendants of members of the society.

What the l.ondnn Paper* Kay Abnui the President's fllcssnire. London, December 3.—The morning Post, commenting on the President,';; message, says if America is really in clined to resume negotiations on the sub ject of the fisheries, she will find the English Ministers animated only by a sincere desire to promote tlie final and satisfactory adjustment which Cleveland mentions. While unable to hold tlie e&tne opinion as Cleveland as to what the great demands of the comity are, the Post thinks it would be bet;er if England would look to the disposition of Ameri can statesmen in the niture rather than wrangle over the past. 

SOMETHING NEW AND TBUE. Tho Daily News says it would express disapprobation for Mr. Cleveland's acriininous reference to the dismissal of Lord Sackville, it Lord Salisbury had not set the example. Mr. Cleveland, it tlinks, evidently has Lord Salisbury's fatai gift of a bitter tongue. In other respects tlie message seems to he ttie most powerful performance which the President has accomplished, namely: The feat of saying something both new and true about protection. The News further remarks that the message is likely to become a household word for tLe orators of Hyde Park and Clerken well The fisheries question, it thinks, will have a smaller chance for settlement under Mr. Harrison than under Mr. Cleveland, but having only oye great party to please, the chances for judgment on its merits may be greatly improved. IN 

CONTBAKT TO LORD SALISBURY. The Chronicle says: President Cleve land uses strong but true language ahont protection. In regard to the Sackville matter, it is satisfying to find that he refers to it as an occurrence to be deeply regretted. This is in marked contrast to Lord Salisbury's flippant sarcasm. We hope that Lord Salisbury will consider it a sufficient reason to appoint a succeeor to Lord Sackville without delay. NOT 

ABHAMKII OF HIMSELF. The Standard says: "President Clev eland's message might have been more gracious and dignified, if he could only have effaced from his recollection the unsuccessful election coup, which sullies an otherwise honorable record. We did not expect to find him repeating hie original error to show that he was not ashamed of himself." After quoting the references to the Sackville matter in tho message, tlie Standard proceeds in a similar strain and runs through sentence after sentence of solemn froth: "Englishmen," it says, "can afford to smile at such puerile non sense. Even Americans will not pre tend to take it in liood earnest. Doubt less Lord Sackville was technically wrong, but Ministers Lowell and Phtlps committed themselves in the samir way, though not in the same de gree, in their addresses to Englishmen, which we read with much edification and not the smallest trace of resent ment." The Standard thinks the fish eries question now has a chance of being settled. UOVKHIViREIHT

CONTINUED FR3M T'! IRD PAGE. I .luring the fiscal year ended June 30, 1888 is 60,2A2: an increase of pension was granted in 45,710 cases. The names of 15,730 Pensioners were dropped from Ihe roll during the year for various causes, and at tbe « osc of the tho number of persons of all (lasses receiving pensions, was 452,557 Of these there w re 800 survivors of the war of 1812; 10,787 widows ol those who served iv thatwa't 10.060 soldiers o< the Mexle n war, and 5,104 widows of said soldiers. One hundred and two rates of pensions were paid beneficiaries, rangiug from *2 to SAI per month. Tne amount piid for pensions during the fiscal year was ♦78.775,80192 be inir an incr.-ase over tho pr. ceding year of $5,308,280.22. The expenses attending the maintenance and operation of the Pension Bureau during that period was +3,2(12,524 (>7, making the entire expenditures of the buteaii $82,038,380.57, being two and a half per cent, of the total ex penditures of the Oovernmeut during the year. REVISION OF PENSION LAWS. I am thoroughly r jnvl" cod that our general pension laws should he reviseJ aud adjusted to meet as far as possible, in the light of our ex pel ie cc. all merited cases. The fact that 102 different rates of pensics are paid cmuot in my opinion bj made consistent With ju-.tice to the pensioned, or to the (lov ernment, and the numerous private pensiou bills that are passed pre Heated tpon the im p rft ctl-iU o'the general laws, while they in creas» in many ensos the existing inequality aud injustice, lend additional force to the recommendation fnr a revision of the general laws on this subj- ct. The laxity of Ideas prev.aii'ng among a large number of our people regarding pensions Is growing c e'y day more marked, lhe princi ples upon which t!:oy should be granted •ire in danger of bjiig altogether ignored, and alieadv pensions are ofteu calmed be cause the applicants are as much entitled as other successful applicants, rathe- than upon any disability or reason attributable to mili tary service. If the establishment of various precedents be continued, the granting of pen nons will not be divorced from partisan and other unwo thy and irrtvalent con siderations, and if tho honorable name of veteran unfairly becomes, by these means, but another twin for one who constant ly clamors for the aid of the govern ment. T'hc-re is danger that injury will he done to Ihe fame at;d patitotism of many whom our oit zeus delight to hon .r, and that a prejudice will be aroused unjust lo meritorious appli cants for pensions.

PLKI'RO I'NECMONIA. Four years ago it wis found tbat Ihe great CHttb- industry of Ihe country was endangered '.ml luoxe engaged in it were alarmed at the rapid extension of the European pliguo of pliuto-pneumonia; serious outbreaks existed in Illinois. Missouri aud Kentucky and iv Ten nessee. Animals aflected wee held in quaran tine Five counties lv New York and from one to four iv each of the States of New Jersey, I'tnnsylvanta, Delaware and Maryland were almost equ Uy afl'ec ed With this great danger upon us and with the contagion already in the channels of com merce, with enormous death and indirect losses already being caiifCd by it, and when only prompt and energetic action could be suc ces ful, there w ere in none of these States any laws authorising this depaitmeut to eradicate the malady, or giving the S ate officials power !o co-operate wiih it for this purpose. The de partment even looked both the requisite appro priation and authority By securing Stae o< -operation iv connec lion wilb authority from Congress the work ol eradication has been pietsed successfully, aod tnis dreaded disease iws been exterminated from the Western States, and also from the Eastern States with the exception < f a few restricted localities, which are itill under supervision. The danger has thu-. beeu re moved aod trade and commerce have beeu free I from the v xatloua state of restrictions which were deemed necessary for a time. THE SUGAR INDUSTRY. During the pas. four years the process of dif fusion, as app.icd to tite mauufacture of sugar from sorghum and sogar cane, has bseu intro duced into this country and perfected by ex periments canicd on by the Department of Agriculture. This process is now universally considered to be the most economi cal, and it is thought the sorghum sugar industry has been established upon a termer basis aud the load to its future mccess opened. I he adoption o! this diffusion process is t.lso extending into Louisiana and other sug".r producing parts of the country, and will doubtless soon be the only method employed for ihe extraction of the sugar from the cane.

It would combine tha discoveries ol science with the economies and amelioration ol rural practice. The supervision of the en dowed txperimt ntal station system, re cently provided for, is a proper lunc , ion of the Department, and ls now in operatiout Its supervision is very importuui, aLd shoutd be wißtly and vigilantly directed to the end that pecuniary aid of tho eiovernment iv favor ol Intelligent agriculture should be so pUed as to lesuit In me general good, aud to tho benefit of the people, th s jusiiiying tlie r.ppiopri nioiitmade from the puolic Treasury. THE SUBSIDIZED RAILROADS. The adjustment tf tie relations between the Q verunient and the railroad companies which have received laud grants, aud the guaranty of tt.e public credit iv aid of the const uciion of their roads, should receive early attention. The report of a majority of the Cemmissloners appointed to examine the affairs aud indebted nets of these roads, in wnich they favor an ex teisioui f the time lor the payment of such indebtedness, in at least one case, where the corporation app ars io be able to comply with well guarded aud exact terms ol s'tcb exten sion, and the reentorc-men', of their opinions by gentlemen of undoubted businesß judgment ana experience appointed to protect the inter ests ol the Uoverument as directors of said cor poration, may well lead to the belief that such au extension would be to the advantage of the Government. The subject should be treated as. a business proposition with a view to lhe final realization of its Indebtedness by the Govern ment, raihci than as a question 10 be decided upou prejudice cr by way of punishment for p evious wroug-dolug. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. The leport of the Commissioners of the Dis trict of Columbia,with its accompanyiug docu meuis, gives in detail the operations oi the several departments of the District government and furnishes evidence that the fluaucial af fairs ol the District are at present iv such a satisfactory condition as to jasiifj the Commis sioners iv submitting to Congress cstimstcs for desirable and needed improvements. The Commissioners lecummtnd certain legislation which, iv their opinion, Is necessary to advance the interests of the District. 1 invite your special attention to their re quest for such legislation as will enablo the Commissloueiß without delay to collect, digest aud propo<iy arrange the laws by wnich tho district is governed, and which are now em braced iv several collections, making them available oily with great difficulty and labor. The suggestions they make touch desituble amendments to the laws relating to licenses granted for cairying on the retail traffic in spirituous liquois, to the observance i f tunday, to tho proper assessment of taxes, to the speedy punishment of minor offenders and to the management of the reformatory and charitable institutions supported by Congress. Appropri ations for all of these are commended for con sideration. I again call attention to the pr. sant incon venience and tbe danger to life aud property attending the opera ion of steam railroads hrough aud across public streets and rods of the district, the propriety of such legislation as will properly guard the use of these railroads and better secure the convenience and safety of eilutens is manifest.
