TheMpirirof Demtrrarr. Jkkk Williams, Esq., bu become one of the editors of the Woodsfield Spirit of Democracy. Mr. W. bad editorial control of tbat paper from 1856 to 1867, and made of it a very popular and suc cessful theet. Under the joint manage ment of himself and Mr. H. R. West, I we expect to see the Spirit, already a spicy, newsy and excellent journal, take front rank among the weeklies of Obio A W hol<-*omr Proposition. Seuator TBl'UBl'll. has introduced a bill making it a penal offence for mem bers of Congress to recommend appoint ments to Federal cilices. His bjii makes the wholesobjectof official appointment independent of Congressional intluence, except in cases where tbo heads of de partments make a special request for information from members. The meas ure will create a lively d iscussion, bnt it will not pass. The course of the Sen ate, in the mutter of the Tenure of Office Act, shows how greedy tbat body is for tbo retention of patronago and power, and indicates a firm opposition on its part to the Trumbull bill. The House ate* will bo averse, for the reason that it will deprive the "loyal" members of the means whereby they draw adbercats around themselves and control re-nom iuations and the likes. There will be much buncombe on the bill, but it will not pass. .More Ku Klux. The bioody Biigadier who runs mili tary matters in Georgia reports a heavy prevalence of Ku-Klnx and the like in bis dominions. He has been induced to git up a report f'u the scalawag and carpet-bag interest, in order to get Congress to interfere and reconstruct the Stat# over again. He tells a doleful tale of anarchy aud misrule down there land proposes as a remedy tbat Congress establish a Provisional Legislature of carpet baggeis in tLe place of the pres ent one which the people elected, and then turn the soldiers loose throughout the State. This would certainly be a splendid way in which to educate the people of Georgia into permanent dis cou ien t and thus give General Tkhky a permanent job by making the presence taere of himself and his muskets a per manent necessity. The people of Geor gia can compromise on better terms. Ii they will ratify the Fifteenth Amendment, get tbeir Senators to re -Uii and elect Tkkky aud some other adventurer in their stead, they will get a eertiiloate of good character at once, no matter how mauy negroes they wallop. ."*?? Ptac e. i he Commanding General in Texas r?*p?rt? three hundred aud eighty-four mnrders tor the first nine months of the |>r. seut year. That is one of tho ad vantage of military rule. When the Gorernuicii. *cts the example of not c iring a button 1 i civil or inoial law and punctures everybody's rights with the b nonet, what is moro natural than tint thecitiz.'u should learn nsheisl taught and take to plundering, pone- 1 tnring and murdering too f That's the j natural "logic of events." But we I thought all this lawlessness and throat cut-Mug in the South was to cease with Guam's election. We were to "have leaoe." And now some epan letted humbug, anxious to be continued in position, as small satrap, tells the Administrate,!! the "peace" pre s ripiion didn't work. They have j'ltS as much good order in Texas and every other Southern State, as they need expect while the bayonet rule is continued. Take the military away and let the people regulate tbeir own aliuirs. I o bos tiro, the carpet-bagger wouldn't thrive and the electious might tut go unanimously Kailical. But for all thk' the country would be happier, bet ter .nd more prosperous. < ollax ii* u GVrer I. ore Advocate Mis McFarland numbered Gkekley aud Colfax among her admirers. It is claimed that tho latter aided her iu pros-uring the Indiana divorce. We suppose this is all light from a "loyal"! stand point. At the >a?r.e time, it is( not usual for publir officials to mix npi conspicuously iu scandalous cases, as IColkax has douo iu this. Discussing t!n> Vice President's course in this mat ter. tbe says : This exalted persouage was intimate ly acquainted with Air. Richardson, who, doobtle.-s, possessed many com mendable qualities, for respecting ; which ?ve do not censnre the VicePresi I dent. But knowing Richardson as he did, long and intimately, Mr. Colfax knew ail about bis illicit intercourse with Mrs. MeFarland ; knew that she was another man's lawful wife, and, being a citizen of Indiana, knew per fectly we 1 that her "divorce" from lirr husband was invalid before Heaven, or any proper earthly tribuua'. ^et, knowing all this, this man whom his country wen, confiding iu his murals as well as his ability, have placed be fore the world :is their cboseu represen tative aud exemplar, has put himself upon the record as a virtual endorser ot Ricbardsou's whole course in thi* abominable atfair. Hearing that the latter bad been shot by the man whose wife he had seduced, the Vice President hastened to telegraph : "Our whole house hold send their siucerest sympathies and warmest wishes;" etc. For the sake of Mr. Coltax's "household"? his wife wife nud aged mother? we trust he did not cousult them before sending this dispatch, although we are informed by the Cincinnati Commercial, that while Mrs. MeFarland was in Indiana, getting her divorce, she was the associate of Mr. Colfax's mother. For him??lf we would faiu hope that be yielded to a sympathetic impulse, without consulting his judgment aud bis sense ot private right and public duty. But the world judges linn according to his act and his words, and stands amazed at both. It asks: "What would Mr Colfax li^re thought, if it had been hit wife whom Richardson alienated from her husband; and though it is another who was wronged, how could Mr. Col fax consent thus, virtually to approve j the act, and endorse the actor T" These j are questions which, we fear, the Vice j President will tiud it difficult to answer in a satisfactory manner. But a few weeks ago Mr. Colfax spoke : in bait Lake City, iu bitter condemna tion of Mortnonisai; yet, on his return' to the realm of Christianity aud Civil-; ization, he sanctions a doctriue wkicb,'' H getiei ally adopted, would tarn the whole country into a worse than Mor I mon seraglio, or a Turkish harem. I The I'mit Coraini llotnr. Ti;e question of admitting negro children into the same schools with white children has, for some time, been ander discussion in Washington City. The agitation commenced there and it was hoped it would stay there. But like all the pernicious propositions of "loyalty" this infernal idea could not be restrained within reasonable limits. Under Ridical manipulation the agitation has been spreading throughout the country The curse of negro equality in this new shape is be ing bronght to our own doors. Last Monday a negro named John WlKStOW applied to the School Board across the river at Bridgeport, Ohio, to have his srep son, a mulatto boy, admit ted to the Union School at ttat place. The mother of the boy, as we aie in formed, is a white woman; bis father a negro, with whom the mother wai inti mate before her marriage with Wins low. Ou Monday night the School Board took the case under consideration. After a long and heated dibcussion a vote was taken upon the following resolu tion, offered by Mr. Tallman, a member of the Board: Ketolted, That the colored youth of this School District be admitted into the schools. Mr. 

CLAYLAND demanded the yeas aod nays. The vote stood, Yeas? Messrs. Rhodes, Tai.i.man and HollowaY. Nays- Messrs. Clatlani>v Cook and Baggs. Some of the friends of the resolution having intimated that its opponents feared to face tbo public upon this vote, aod that those opponents would, in the course of a few years, bo ashamed of their action in this matter, Doctor John Cook moved that tb? resolution and the vote thereon be published in the Wheeling papers. The motion pre vailed. It may be well to mention here the provision of the Ohio School Law, that where there are twenty negro cliil jien or more in a School District, a sep arate school shall be established for their hern tit. In tbo B idgoport Dis trict it appears tber* are but eighteen. The fact ?uggesis a fair basis of com promise. The geutlemeu who favor ad mitting the negroes to white schools cannot, of course, longer insist upon mixing black* and whites against the wishes of the latter. At the same time, they canuot object to giving their own children the benefit of negro society in the schools. Let them take these eighteen colored children and add enough of their own to make up the number required by law fi>ra separate school, and stait one in which their peculiar ideas will bo recognized aud to which the black blessings they desire will be vouchsafed. We presume that the opponents of admitting the negro to the white schools will not object, and certainly tho fiiends of that measure canuot de cline ti proposition which assutes their families of a monopoly of the col ored society for which they cliimor_ The world recognizes their right to select, just snch companions for their children ;ib they wish. Objection is made simply to their forcing i.egro children iuto white schools agaiust the wishes of white children .fnd white pa rents. It is sadly to bo regretted that this unfortunate, this foolish agitation his been commenced in this vicinity. It will only serve to produce bitterness and strife among the people, inflict damage upon the schools, aud stir up enmity against the blacks. God knows the country has done enough already for tho negro, without breaking down tl'o aoeial barriers that divide the rue--#. He has received Lis freedom, his civil rights, and :u many States his vote. In tho matter of legislation for the past six or eight years, ten measures have been enacted for his benefit where the white man has received one. His en forced elevatiou must stop somewhere, j lias not enough bren done already! O.io thiug is certain : the negro has re ,- ivod about all the special privileges public opinion is disposed to accord him . His white friends bad better not push his claims further. Let them take him into their own houses if they desire, but it*, them uot demand that his children and tbo children of all the white citi zens of the country shall be placed upon the same footing, in the same school houses, upon the same play grounds and in the same social inter course. With all the "progress" that has been made, it is more than possible to arouse fiercer feeling upon this subject than would bo compatible with the welfare of the race in whose behalf these extraordinary domands are being put forth. Once provoke the masses to a struggle against this curse of negro equality, aud ilie sad conclusion would rapidly he reached that the two race# cannot dwell h*re together in peace. Korr nnd Nnvngr. The Intcllige nctr man is sore in bodv and bones. He developed more irrita tion yesterday than was contained in all the beils of Job. Inward bilious ness and outward ulceration possess him altogether. He needs more soothing syrup than ten teething babies; he is the most aggravated subject for salvo that has bfen seen since the days of LazaRCS. His troubles are all the result of the message business. Ho proposed to astonish the reading public by his enterprise in publishing that docamont and he merely succeeded in gettiflU laughed at. lo hide his mortification, he proceeds to demonstrate that the Registkk did no* beat the Intellificucer out of sight in its extra of Monday evening, because the latter contained more matter Tuesday morning than the former. Yesterday morniug the REGISTER con tained the "news of the sinking of the Rebecca; the Intelligencer had not a line on the subject. Pursuing the same course of argument as on the message qnestion,our cotemporary will probably prove that he beat us in this, hecanse next week, in some single issue, he ex? pects to print more matter than the Rkgistkr. We beg leave to remind onr carbun cled cotemporary that, tbe question at issue is simply this: Was the Intelligencer beaten by the Register in the publica tion of an extra containing the mesaaget The former paper announced that it would receive the message "at the earliett moment," earlier than anybody else, and would publish accordingly. Its advertisement was a long way ahead of its enterprise. Our extca edi tion was about disposed of before tbe Intelligencer containing the. message made its appearanoe. We do not care I about putting salt and pepper on oar neighbor's wounds, bnt will content oara selves by Baying that after his cbmpoei tors had Soished their work there were not brains enough in tbe balance of the establishment to put the message together in order. Fortunately for tbe Intelligencer folks, tbe Register extra was furnished them, from which they could learn tbe way out of their troubles, luatead of being grateful for timely assistance, tbe Intelligencer betakes itself to makiog months and venting its ill-humor on its benefactor. Thankless as oar neighbor is, be is harmless and tolerably amus ing. Perceiving that he feels very badly, w? tender him our aymptfCby, and bespeak for him an early visit of the Health Officer. Uaforlunale Doelriae. Speaking of tbe Cuban question, the President's message says : The principle is maintained, however, that this nation is its own judge when to accord tbe rights of belligerency, either to a people struggling to free themselves from a government they be lieve to be oppressive, or to independ ent nations at war with each other. It strikes us that this paragrapl^vir tually concedes tbe whole ground upon which the Government claims repara tion from England for her course during the rebellion. The United States can claim no right for themselves that may not be claimed by any other nation. If, then, this Government is its own judge of the time when to accord belligerent rights, England must be conceded to have an equal right ef free and inde pendent judgment upon the same ques tion. England has now but to set up that in recognizing the belligerency of the Confederacy she was merely exer cising tbe right of judgment which the United States claim, and Grant is debarred from prosecuting against the former country the American claim for reparation. The "grave wrongs" to which tbs message refers in its discussion of tbe Alabama question resulted almost en tirely from tho extension of belligerent lights to tbe rebels. But according to Grant's position on the Cuba question, they cease to be wrongs, and become merely tho lawful consequences of an act of national judgment exercised un der tho very conditions which the Pres ident proscribes for bis own Adminis tration. lie canuot blow hot and cold with the same breath. Ho cannot ad vocate a principle in the Cuba case and deuy to England the right fcrafply it in the Alabama oase. If tWr<? is any meaning in language be has coneeded away tho speech of Sumner and the Alabama claims. Annual Itrporl of the Nccrclnry of the ! Interior. Washington, D. C., December 6. Tho Report of the Secretary of the Interior states that the amount of pub lic lands sold during tke year wai 7,666,* 151 acres ? abwut one million greater than during the previous year. The unmber entered rnider tbo homestead laws, which are included in the above, exceeds last year by 400,000 acres. The cash receipts are nearly four and a half millions of dollars. 13,762 patents were issued during the year, tho fees being $213 ,926 in excess of expedituresexceed ed the receipts. Au appropriation is asked for tbe Patent Office for the next tiscal year, of ?504 ,420. Thirty millions will be required for fthe pension service duriug the next fis cal year. The Secretary urges tbe assemblage cf ludians upon larger reservations, where their numbers will be more ag greated, and where tbe more civilized of the in will influence the others in striving to progress in tbe arts of peace, and earnestly recommends an appropri ation to enable the tribes iu tbe Iudian Territory proper to form a general or ganization, with most of tbe elements of a territorial government. He believes them well prepared to dispense with tbe tutelage ot agents, if they may have a delegate iu the House of Representa tives to speak for them. The Indians north of Platte River are yet unprepared for a similar organize tion, but the time cannot be far distaut when two or three principal Indian Ter ritories may properly embrace all tribes east of the Rocky Mountains. The same policy of conoentration will apply to the country west of the Rocky Mountains. The Secretary approves of the labors of the Peace Commission, and the policy now pursued by Indian agents. He suggests the placing of the educa tion of freedmeu under tho charge of ] the Commissioner of Education. He recommends the erection of fire ; proof buildings for the Federal Courts. I A statement of the condition of the ' P.icitic Railroad is given, the facts of which are already known. TheaQairs of the District of Columbia j are alluded to. and some recommenda- ' I tions made. The Secretary concludes with an arga | inent in favor of civil service reform.
