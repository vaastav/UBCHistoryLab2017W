Harris and have secured him a place in the Senate post office. Some Vermont editors are horn to office, some achieve office, and some have an office thrust upon them. Gen. V. W. Grout is in great demand these days at dairymen's gatherings where proposed oleomargarine legisla tion is the principal topic of discussion. He was one ot the speakers at the Iowa State Dairymen's association at Du huq'ie last month and will address the New York State Dairymen's association next week. The tarmers are in earnest over the Grout bill and propose to fight until Congress passes the oleo bill. The Washington correspondents have already begun to throw bouquets to the Vermont congressman. Commenting on our two representatives the correspond ent of the I'iov donee Journal says: "Foster will doubtless be pronounced the very handsomest man in the new congress. Heisutder middle age and has a lancinating luce andgraceful figure. His loiehead is high, his ees aie b ack and instinct will) intelligence, and his moustache and st)lsli sidewhiskers are becomingly tinged with gray. Withal, he dresses in exquisite taste. Haskins, who succeeds Gi n Grout, is advanced in years, is tif a serious cast of countenance, end is credited with lots of sense." The Grout Oleo Bill. The oleom"rg irine measure, known as the Grout bill, will be introduced in the House by Mr Tawney ol Minnesota and pressed to its passage. The bill, which failed of passage in the Senate, prohibited the sending of oleomargarine into any state which forbade the sale ot that product; increased from 2 cents to 10 cents a pound the internal revenue tax on oleomargarine artificially colored in imitation of butter, and reduced the tax on the uncolored product from 2 cents to one-quarter cent a pound. The objection of the opponents of the pro posed legislation was to the tax on the uncolored product, and as a concession to this sentiment the tax on that article may be entirely abolished in the new bill.

"The Sunny South" handles the matter with gloves off, and declares that the storv passes the dead line of southern sentiment. It appears that the story was selected after a synopsis had been submitted, and not until the fourth in stalment reached "The Sunny South" was the ol jectionable feature discovered.

Enthusiastic sup porters ol Dr. Webb, however, declare that he is an excellent judge ol holdings of all kinds and that he never takes a mortgage when he can as easily possess the property he wants at once.

The president in his annual message to congress says: The congress assembles this year un der the shadow of a great calamity. On the Cth of September President Me Kinley waa shot by an anarchist while attending the Pan-American exposi tion at P.iii'l'alo and died in that city on the 1 Ith of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents he is the third who has been murdered, and the bare recital of this fact is sullieieiit to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citizens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third as sassination of an American president, have a peculiarly sinister siguilicance. Both President Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types unfortunately not uncommon in history. President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war and Presi dent Garfield to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker. Presi dent McKiiiley was killed by an utter ly depraved criminal belonging to that body of criminals who object to all governments, gootl and bad alike, who are against any form of popular lib erty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws and who are as hostile lo the upright exponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsible despot. Anarchy nnil Anarchists. The president continues with a eulogy of Mr. McKiiiley, then turns to the subject of anarchy, denouncing its doctrines and preachers. He says: I earnestly recommend to tbecongress that in the exercise of its wise discre tion it should take into consideration the coming to this country of anarch ists or persons professing principles hostile to all government and justify ing the murder of those placed in au thority. Such individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Hum bert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigorous punishment. They and those like then) should be kept out of this country, and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came, and farreaehiiig provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress. A Subject Fop Federal Conrts. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is lu line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be pro portioned to the enormity of the of fense against our institutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should baud against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade. The president next considers busi ness conditions, which he finds highly satisfactory. He continues: The tremendous and highly complex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapidity during the latter half of the nineteenth cen tury brings us face to face at the be ginning of the twentieth with very serious social problems. The old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite sufficient to regulate the ac cumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so enormously increased the pro ductive power of mankind they are no longer sullieieiit. Trade Combinations. The growth of cities has gone on be yond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the up building of the great industrial centers has meant a startling increase not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very large Individual and especially of very large corporate fortunes. The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to t tie tariff nor to any other govern mental action, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in oth er countries as they operate in our own. The process has aroused much an tagonism, a great part of which is i wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the con- trary, never before has the average man, the wageworker, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this country and at the present time. There ; have been abuses connected with the accumulalion of wealth, yet it remains true tlia; 'i fortune accumulated in .i;itimate business can be accumulat ed by the person specially benefited only on condition of conferring im mense incidental benefits upon oth ers. Miccessiui enterprise or the type which benefits all mankind can only exist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success. Itpnsom For Caution, The president adds that there are many reasons for caution In dealing with corporations. He says: The same business conditions which lave produced the great aggregations of corporate and individual wealth have made them very potent factors In International commercial competition. Moreover, it cannot too often be pointed out that to strike with Ignorant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endangers the interests of all. The fundamental rule In our national life the rule which un derlies all others is that, on the whole and in the long run, we shall go up or down together. The mechanism of modern business Is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with It In a spirit of rashness or Ignorance. In dealing with business interests, for the government to undertake by crude and ill considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to incur the risk of such farreaeh iiig national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand the impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nom inally at war, for they hamper those who would endeavor to tind out in ra tional fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply reme dies. How to Correct the Evils. All this Is true, and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils, one of the chief being overcapitaliza tion because of its many baleful con sequences, ami a resolute and practical effort must be made to correct these evils. It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to re quire that when men receive from gov ernment the privilege of doing busi ness under corporate form, which frees them from individual responsibility and enables them to call into their en terprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon absolutely truthful representations as to the value of the property in which the capital is to be invested. Corporations engaged in in terstate commerce should be regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the busi ness world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corporations exist only because they are created and safe guarded by our institutions, and it is therefore our right aud our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions. Publicity the First Essential. The first essential in determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts publicity. In the interest of the pub lic the government should have the right to inspect and examine the work ings of the great corporations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy which we can now invoke. What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be de termined after publicity has been ob tained by process of law and in the course of administration. The first requisite is knowledge, full and com pleteknowledge which may be made public to the world. Artificial bodies, such as corporations and joint stock or other associations, depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges should be subject to proper governmental super vision, and full and accurate informa tion as to their operations should be made public regularly at reasonable intervals. The large corporations, commonly called trusts, though organized in one state, always do business in many states, often doing very little business in the state where they are inewpo mtoi TK j- to utter lsiek of uniform ity in the state laws about them, and, as no state has any exclusive interest in or power over their acts, it has In practice proved impossible to get ade quate regulation through state action. Therefore, in the interest of the whole people, the nation should, without in terfering with the power of the states in the matter itself, also assume power of supervision and regulation over all corporations doing an interstate busi ness. Amend Constitution if Necessary. When the constitution was adopted, at the end of the eighteenth century, no human wisdom could foretell the sweeping changes, alike in industrial and political conditions, which were to take place by the beginning of the twentieth century. At that time it was accepted as a matter of course that the several states were the proper authorities to regulate, so far as was then necessary, the comparatively in significant and strictly localized cor porate bodies of the day. The condi tions are now wholly different, and wholly different action is called for. I believe that a law can be framed which will enable the national govern ment to exercise control along the lines above indicated, profiting by the expe rience gained through the passage aud administration of the interstate com merce act. if, however, the judgment of the congress is that it lacks the con stitutional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. There should be created a cabinet of ficer, to be known as secretary of commerce and industries, as provided jn the bill introduced at the last ses lion of the congress. It should bt? his province to deal with commerce in its broadest sense, including anion!; many other tilings whatevor concerns labor Itching Skin Distress by day and night That's the complaint of those who are so unfortunate as to be afflicted with Eczema or Salt. Eh on m and out ward applications do not cure. They can't. The source of the trouble is in the blood make that pure and this scal ing, burning, itching skin disease will disappear. "I va taken with an itching on my arms which, proved very disagreeable. I concluded it was wilt rheum and bought a bottle of liuod's Sarsaparilla. In two days after I hc-iam taking it I felt better and it was nut long before I was cured. Have never li 1,1 any skin disease since." Mrs. Iiia K. Ward, Cove Point, Md. Hood's Sarsaparilla and Pills rid the blood of all impurities and cure all eruptions. and all matters affecting the greal business corporations and our mer chant marine. Labor. The president declares that he re gards it necessary to re-enact the Chi nese exclusion law. In regard to labor he says that the government should provide in its contracts that all work Should be done under "fair" conditions and that all night work should be for bidden for women and children as well as excessive overtime. He continues: Very great good has been aud will be accomplished by associations or unions of wageworkers when managed with forethought and when they combine in sistence upon their own rights with law abiding respect for the rights of others. The display of these qualities in such bodies is a duty to the nation no less than to the associations them selves. Finally, there must also in many cases be action by the govern ment in order to safeguard the rights and interests of all. Under our consti tution there is much more scope for such action by the state and the munic ipality than by the nation. Put on points such as those touched on above the national government can act. He asserts that the immigration laws are unsatisfactory and that a law should be enacted to keep out not ouly anarchists, but persons' of a low moral tendency or of unsavory reputation and those who are below a certain standard of economic fitness to enter our industrial field as competitors with American labor. The Tariff and Kecliiroclty. The president declares that nothing could be more unwise than to disturb the business interests of the country by any general tariff change at this time. He adds: Yet it is not only possible, but emi nently desirable, to combine with the stability of our economic system a sup plementary system of reciprocal bene fit and obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity is an Incident and re sult of the linn establishment and preservation of our present economic policy. It was specially provided for in the present tariff law. Reciprocity must be treated as the handmaiden of protection. Our first duty Is to see that the protection grant ed by the tariff in every case where It is needed is maintained, and that reci procity be sought for so far as it can safely be done without injury to our home industries. Just how far this is must be determined according to the individual case, remembering always that every application of our tariff pol icy to meet our shifting national needs must be conditioned upon the cardinal fact that the duties must never be reduced below the point that will cover the difference between the labor cost here and abroad. The well being of the wageworker is a prime considera tion of our entire policy of economic legislation. (50 YlARS THE

THE WORLD'S WORK AN UP-TO-DATE MACAZINE, CI.VHBEI) WITH THE CALEDONIAN. Need For Wider Mnrkct. Subject to this proviso of the proper protection necessary to our industrial well being at home, the principle of reciprocity must command our hearty support. The phenomenal growth of our export trade emphasizes the ur gency of t lie need for wider markets and for a liberal policy in dealing with foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty and vexatious in the way of trade restrictions should be avoided. The customers to whom we dispose of our surplus products in the long' run, directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus products by giving us some thing in return. Their ability to pur chase our products should as far as possible be secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable us to take from them those products which we can use without harm to our own industries and labor or the use of which will be of marked benefit to us. It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our present prosperity. We have now reached the point in the development of our in terests where we are not only able to supply our own markets, but to pro duce a constantly growing surplus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can util ize existing duties in any case where they are no longer needed for the pur pose of protection, or in any case where the article is not produced here and the duty is no longer necessary for revenue, as giving us something to offer in exchange for what we ask. The cordial relations with other na tions which are so desirable will nat urally be promoted by the course thus required by our own interests. The natural line of development for a policy of reciprocity will be In connec tion with those of our productions which no longer require all of the sup port once needed to establish them upon a sound basis and with those oth ers where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. I ask the attention of the senate to the reciprocity treaties laid before it by uiy predecessor. The Merchant Marine. The condition of the American mer chant marine is such as to call for im mediate remedial action by the con gress. It Is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterly insignificant in com parison to that of other nations which we overtop in oilier forms of business. We should not longer submit to condi tions under which only a trilling por tion of our great commerce is carried In our own ships. To remedy this stat' of things would not merely serve to build tip our shipping interests, but il e would also result In benefit to all who are interested In the permanent estab lishmeut of a wider market for Amor lean products aud would provide an auxiliary force for the navy.
