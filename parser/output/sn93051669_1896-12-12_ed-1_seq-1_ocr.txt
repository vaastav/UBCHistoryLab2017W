IMsrovered Dr. Powell Tbe Mints Rave Been Busy the Past Tear. by Cincinnati, Dec. 4. A special to the Commercial Tribune from Key West, Fla., says: Passengers by steamer from Havana tonight say that a train with 500 wounded Spaniards .arrived there to day. It was said most of them came' from the vicinity of San Cristobal and Candelaria. No definite statement could be had as to what battlefield they came from. Rumors prevailed on their arrival that Weyler had sustained an other defeat. Counter statements were also made that the vanguard of Maceo's army had been defeated. Moreover, it was announced that wey- ler is on the eve of attempting to storm some of the hilltops where Maceo is en trenched, and this has raised great ex pectations in Havana. Several Ameri can correspondents at Havana nave had friendly warnings tbat Weyler is contemplating some of tbe more out spoken ones because their reports do not please him. The old lady was right when she said that child might die if they waited for the doctor. She saved the little one's life with a few doses of One Minute Cough Cure.

This city has been thrown Into consterna tion by a descent of the Spanish police. Tbe homes of many peaceable citizens were entered after the town had gone j to bed. It is known tbat at least 25 persona were arrested and hurried to prison. Nearly all of Eastern Cuba is in tbe hands of the Cubans, save the city. The Spanish policy of arresting citizens suspected of sympathy with the insurgents had long -since spread among all classes. The recent arrests are further evidence of General Wey ler's determination to wage war on citizens in their homes, as well as on the armed bodies in the field.

Washington, D. C, Dec. 7. By 11 o'clock the putlii: tall ries of the sen ate were well filled and crowds were at the entrances unable to gain ad mission. Exactly at 12 o'clock, Vice President Stevenson entered and called the senate to order, nd Rev. Dr. Milburn delivered an impressive invocation The roll-call showed 70 senators present. Cullom was tbe first to receive recognition, offering a reso lution that tbe bouse be notified that the senate was in session and ready to proceed with business, which was agreed td. Sherman made the custo mary motion for a committee of sen ators and members to wait upon the president. Upon its adoption the pre siding officer named Sherman and Smith of New Jersey as a committee from the senate. At 1 o'clock there was a further recess for 30 minutes, then another for 15 minutes. At 1:45 Senator Sherman reported that the president would communicate his views in writing. Senatot Prudeo, of tbe White House staff, immediately stepped forward with the message, which General Cox, secretary of the senate, read. At tbe conclusion of tbe reading of the president's message the senate adjourned at 3:35 p. M. Tbe house presented an animated scene for an hour before Speaker Reed appeared. The galleries, to which the public was admitted without cards, were crowded before 11 o'clock, while the halls were jammed with those unable to gain entrance. As the hands of the clock pointed to 12, Speaker Reed quietly ascended the rostrum looking bronzed and vigorous. The hum of conversation finally ceased. Rev. Cowder, of Michigan, chaplain of the house, offered a simple but impressive prayer. The roll-call showed the presence of 271 members. The usual formal resolution for the appointment of a committee to join a similar committee of the senate to in form the president tbat tbe house was ready for business was adopted. The speaker appointed Cannon of Illinois, Payne of New York, and Turner, of Georgia.

Dr. Thomas Powell, of Columbia, seems to have learned how to inoculate a man's . sys tem so as to render it impervious to disease germs. As vaccination pre vents smallpox, so this discovery will ward off scarlet fever, consumption, diphtheria and every other disease caused by germs. So confident is Dr. Powell of the truth of his discovery that he has written largely for scienti fic journals on the subject, and has tested it practically by exposing him self to all manner of diseases. Be entered this week into an agree ment with California capitalists by which he is to be paid $9000 for one- third interest in the discovery.

At high tide today the Glenmorag, which has been high and dry on North beach for many months, was floated by Captain Burns, but not entirely pulled off the beach. It will take another effort to get her into deep water. It is hoped to get her clear tomorrow. At last comes a bit of appreciation from a source whence it has long1 been withheld. A young Englishman, who lias been doing the rounds of the Amer ican cities, writes home in praise of us, and, better still, an English weekly. the Gentlewoman, publishes it, as fol lows: "The Americans 1 simply love; they are so wonderfully sympathetic to one. There is no trouble they will cot take, or personal inconvenience ihey will not suffer, if in uny way they can render one a service." The name of this extraordinary young Englishman is not given or it should be blazoned forth. The weekly paper, in reproducing the extract, takes its cue from it, and urges Londoners and all English folk to appreciate the "bouudless kindness end hospitality which they (Anier leans) heap upon ur," and be ready to. "receive the strangers right royally in return. It calls utttention further (o the unprecedented influx of "men and women from all parts of the United States" who are now crowding, find will for the next six weeks crowd, London, and then separate for wander ings all over England, and makes a plea that they be well treated. There is a bit of policy in its concluding ad- vice, which every one who has suffered the extortionate impertinence of the London tradespeople an imperti nence none the less because it is often enveloped in fawning servility will say a hearty " amen" to: "In these bad times of depression in trade, it would be as much to our advantage as to theirs, not only to welcome, but retain the Americans in England as long as possible. Not all Americans are rich, though most are generous. We are sadly in need of their dollars, but need not be extortionate, for all that." One is provoked and indignant to think of the thousands of dollars these "crowds of Americans" will spend, not only in England but through Europe, before the autumn will send them borne again, l'rovoked because many of the thousands will go for 'things that will be bought under the impres sion that if they are the same price they are better than can be bought at home, while, if they are cheaper than the same goods here, it will still be sup posed that they are of the same quality. A woman buying gloves in Paris last summer wits surprised at the prico charged ber for the make of gloves she was accustomed' to buy for con siderably less in New York. "Ah, madatne," said the glib shop girl, "but we send only our 'seconds' to New York." Of course this was wholly untrue. It is absurd to sup pose that skilled American wholesale buyers are going to be imposed upon with seconds of anything, much less gloves, whose quality is a known quan tity every time to an expert in the trade.' Tbe same woman's experience in Lou don was similar Prices were always York, but stress was invariably laid on the superior wearing qualities, a stress that was expensively disproved in the case of most articles.

' I never heard a young girl say, as young girls are often fond of saying," observed an old lady on the summer boarding-house piazza, "what sort of a man she will marry and what sort only, that I do not think of certain speeches to which I myself have listened from pretty lips before this. A school friend of mine so held New Jersey in detestation that she tore its map from her geography. She used to say that nothing would induce her to marry a man who was a widower, or wore a wig, or lived in New Jersey. And the man of her choice was guilty of all three of these enormities. I used to talk over my future with two cousins. I would not marry a business man, I said. Kate would not think of a clergyman, or Carry of a farmer. And we married respectively, a busi ness man, a clergyman and a farmer It ia all like a smart young American 'help in my grandmother's kitchen, who was wont to declaim to ns chil dren on tbe scorn in which she held-all men, always winding up her denuncia tions of the sex by: 'No, I wouldn't marry any man that walks on two legs. And she didn't She married m one-legged man!" N. Y. Times.

Hertz, of The Dalles, and Miss Lillian Bernard!, of Salem. The happy &room is one of The Dalles' most prosperous young business men and highly respected citizens. He has resided in tbe city the greater portion of his life, haying come here when only ten years of age, and has won the friendship of the entire com munity. The bride is a daugter of one of (he beat-known pioneer families of the state, her father, Joseph Bernard!, having been one of the early settlers of Marion county. Miss Bernard!, now How the Anlmnl Is Developed Into a Fighter for theFulillo Arena. The bulls used for fighting purposes are a specially -selected, specially-cared-for class. They are all pedi greed. Andalusia is especially the district of the bnlL Flere, at the age of one year, tho younj bulls are separated from the heifers, branded with tho owner's mark and turned out loose on the plains to graze with others of their own age. When a year older the yonng bulls are gathered together in order that their mettle and fighting qualities may be tested. One ' of them ia separated from the herd and rJinaf.tl lv n. inn nn kavc.bi.ck, vrhoj tiy tne skill fuf $se of a blunted lance, overthrows the escap ing bull, whereupon another rider comes in ftont of the animal with a sharper lance to withstand the ex pected attack. If the bull, on regain ing his feet, attacks the rider twice it is passed as a fighting animal; but if he turns tail and runs off then it is set aside to be killed or to be used in agri cultural work. And so with each ani mal, until the whole herd of two-year-olds has been tested. Each bull that has stood the test successfully is then entered in the , herd book with a description of its ap j pearance and receives a name such as Espartero, Ilamcnco and the like. This process of careful selection goes on from year to 3-car until the bull is five years old, when, should its mettle still prove true, it i3 ready for the arena, and flaming posters appear on the walls of Madrid or Seville announcing that Espartero (or whatever his name is) will, on such and such a date, make his first and final appearance. A good "warrantable" five-year-old bull for the fighting ring costs f-om 70 to 80. In Mesoorlam. Died, Dec. 2, 1896, Frank, the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Bartlett. Dear Friends: I know how impos sible it is to silence your grief with words. The heart pleads for utter ance in tear?, and speaks thus: We bow in sorrow for tbe taking of your little one, feeling that while the rip ened fruit may be gatheted, it seems cruel that the bud should be taken be fore it has even opportunity to unfold its blossom. But in nature fruits fall and so do blossoms and buds. In the ways of kind nature this is perhaps best, and in taking from our arms this little one, we will try and accept the cross and bear it, believing that the bud will yet blossom and bear fruit in the angel land where the spirit of this pure child has so early flown.
