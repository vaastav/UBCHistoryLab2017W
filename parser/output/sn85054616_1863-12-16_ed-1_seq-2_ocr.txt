f Ail n i be not only to relinquish a lever of power, but would also be a cruel sod astounding breach of faith. I may odd at this point that while I remain in my present position, I shall not attempt to repeat or modify the Emanci pation Proclamation. It should be observed also, that this pare of the oath 13 subject to the modifying and abrogating power ot legis lation, and supreme judicial decision. Tbe proposed acquiescence of the National Executive in any reasonable and temporary state arrangement for the freed people, is made with the view ot possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whle States. It 19 hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up theiejuse of the.ir.offlective if, to this ex tent, this vital matter be left' to themselves, while no power of the National Executive to prevent an abuse,' la abridged by the proposi tion.,, . . . The. suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the Statesonpvnat is called reconstruction, is made in the hope that it may do good without the danger of harm. It will save labor and avoid great confusion. But why any proclamation now upon this suhject ? This question is be set with, the conflicting news that the step might be delayed too long or be taken too soon. In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, bui remain reactive ap parently for want of a rallying point a plan of action. Why shall A. adopt the plan ot B rather than B that ot A? And if A and should ' agree, bow can they know but that the Gen eral Government here will reject their plan ? By the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be rejected here. This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the National Executive consists in the danger or committals on points which could be more safely left to further .develop ments. Care has been taken to so shape (be document aa to avoid embarrassment from this source. in saying that on certain terms certain clas e will be pardoned with their rights restor ed, it is not said that other classes on other terms will never be included. In saying that a reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specified way, it is not said that it will never be accepted in any other way. The movements, by State action, for eman cipation in several ot the States not included in the Emancipation Proclamation, are mat ters of profound gratnlation. . And while I do Dot repeat in detail what I have heretofore so earnestly urged upon this -subject, my general views and feelings remain unchanged, and I - trust tbat Congress will omit no fiic opportunity of aiding these steps to the great consummation. In the midst of other cares, however impor tant, we must not lose sight of the fact that the war power is still our main reliance to that power alone can we look, yet for a time to give confidence to the people in the con tested regions that the insurgent power will not again overrun them.- Until that confi dence shall be established little can be done my where for what is called Reconstruction ; nence,our ehiefest cares must still be directed to the army and navy, who have thus far borut their harder part so nobly and well; and it may be esteemed foitunato that in giving the greatest efficiency to those indispensable armies, we do also honorably recognise the gallant men, from commander to sentinel, who compose them and to whom more than to others the world must stand indebted for the hone oi freedom, disenthralled, regenerated, enlarged and perpetuated. ,. . 

ABKAH AM LINCOLN. December 8, 1863. The following is the Proclamation appended to the ilebsage : PROCLAMATION. Whereas, In and by the Constitution'of the United States, it is provided that the Presi dent shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for an offense airairibt the United States, except in cases of impeachment ; and Whereas, A Rebellion now exists whereby the loyal Stale Governments of several States have tor a long time been subverted, and many persons have committed and are uow guilty of treason against the United States, and Whereas, With reference to said rebellion and treason, laws have been enacted by Con gress declaring forfeitures and confiscation of property and liberation of slaves, all upon terms and conditions therein stated ; and also declai ing that the President was thereby au thorized at any time thereafter, by proclama tion, to extend to persons who may have par ticipated in tuo existing rebellion in any Scale, or psrt thereof, pardon and amnesty, with such exceptions and at such times and on such conditions as he may deem expedient for the public welfare, and ' Whereas, The Congressional declaration for limited and conditional pardou accords with the well-established judicial exposition of the pardoning power, and Whereat, With reference to the said Rebel lion the President of the United St3tes has issued several proclamations with provisions in regard to the liberation of slaves, and Whereas, It is now desired by some persons heretofore engaged in the said Rebellion to resume their allegiance to the United States, and to reinangurate. loyal State Governments within and for their respective States; Therefore I,' Abraham Lincoln, President of the United Stales, do proclaim, declare and make known to all persons who have directly or bv implication participated in the existing Rebellion, except as hereinafter excepted, that a full pardon is hereby granted to them and each ot them, with restoration of all rights of property, except as to slaves, and in property caswi where the rights of third parties shall have intervened, and npon the condition that every such person shall take and subscribe an oath inviolate, and which oath shall be regis tered for peimanent preservation, and shall be of the tenor and effect following, to wit : "I, , do solemnly swear in presence of Almighty God, that I will henceforth faith fully support, protect and defend the Consti tution of the United States and the Union of the States thereunder, and that I will, in like manner, abide by and faithfully support all acts of Congress passed during the existing Rebellion with reference to slaves, so long and so far as not repealed, modified, or held void by Congress or by decision ot tbeSu--premo Conrt. and tbat I will in like manner abide and faithfully support all proclamations f the President made during the existing Rebellion having reference to slaves, so long o far as not modified or declared void by de cision of the Supreme Court. So help me God." . . The persons excepted torn the benefits of the foregoing provisions are all who are or shall bavs been civil or diplomatic officers or gents of tho so-called Confederate Govern ment; all who have left judicial stations un der the United States to aid the Rebellion ; &I1 who are or shall have been military or na val officers of said so-called Confederate Gov ernment above the rank ot Colonel In the ar my, of Lieutenant In the Davy ; all who left eats in the United States Congress to aid the Rebellion.. . - , , , AH who resigned commissions in the array otpvty 6t the rjolte-d States, sod afterward aided the Rebellion, and all who have-engaged in any way In treating colored persons or white persons in charge of such, otherwise than lawfully as prisoners of war, have beea found in the United States service as soldiers, seamen or in any other capacity. - . And I . do further proclaim,' declare, and make known, that whenever, in any of the States of Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Missis sippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Sooth Carolina and North Carolina, a number of tbo rotes jast in sich States, at tbe Presi dential election of tho year of our Lord, 1860, each having taken the oath aforesaid, and not having since violated it, and being a qualified voter by the electiou law of the State existing immediately before the so-called act of Se cession, and excluding all others, shall re-establish Ik State Government, which shall be republican, and in now ise contravening said oath, such shall be recognized , as the true Government of the State, and the State shall receive thereunder the benefit of the consti tional provision which declares that "the United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican form of" Govern ment, and shall protect each of them againts invasion, on application of the Legislature, or of the Executive, when the Legislatnre cannot be convened, against domestic vio lence." : And I do further proclaim, declare, and make known, that any provision which may be adopted by such a . State Government, in relation to the freed people ot such a State, which shall recognize and declare their per manent freedom, provide for their education and which may yet be consistent, a temporary arrangement, with their present condition, as a laboring, landless and harmless class, will not be objected to by the National Executive. And it is suggested as not improper that in constructing a loyal State government in any State, tbe name of the State, the boundary, the subdivisions, tbe Constitution and the general code of laws as before the rebellion be maintained, sulrject only to the modifica tions made neeessary by the conditions here in before stated, and such others, if any, not contravening the said conditions, and which maybe deemed expedient by those framing the new State Government. To avoid misunderstanding, it may be prop er to say that this proclamation, so far as it relates to State Governments, has.no refer ence to the States wherein loyal State Gov ernments had all the while been maintained. And tor the same reason it may be proper to further say that whether members of Con gress from any State shall be admitted to their seats constitutionally, rests exclusively with the respective- Houses and not to any extent with tbe Executive. And still further that this proclamation is intended to present the people of the United States wherein the National authority has been suspended"and tbo loyal State Governments have been sub- 1 verted, a mode by which the National author ity and loyal State Governments may be re-established within the "-said States or in aiiy of them, and while the mode presented is the best ths Executive can suggest with his present impression, it must not be understood that no other possible mode would be accept able.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, By the President. Wh. H. Skwaed, Secretary of State. THE WAR IN JAP AS. If we except the blowing of Indian prison ers of war from the mouths of cannon by Brit ish soldiers iu 1858 and 1853, notbiug more atrocious has occurred In the history of our time than tbe recent bombatdment of the town of Kagosima, in Japan, by the British fleet under Admiral Kuper. The excuse for this outrage was the murder of an Englishman who, with tbe arrogance of his race, bad undertaken to violate cue of the prejudices of the Japanese, and who paid tbe penalty of his folly with bis life. By way of retribution, the British first extorted a large stun of money from the Japanese Government, and, having got this, proceeded 'to bombard a town as large as Boston, without warning to the women or children. The ruffian who com manded the British vessels on this occasiou actually felicitated ' himself and his Govern ment on his belief that "at least half the town had been set in flames." And these are tbe PecksnilTs who abuse Gillmore lur using Greek fire against a place from which all wo men and children hid beea warned a month before It seems likely that the English will find they have an elephant on their hands in Ja pan. Their business with the Japanese is to sell them British manufactures. They will discover that they cannot bombard them into buying British goods as easily as they bom barded the Chinese Government into repeal ing the prohibition on imports of opium. The Japanese will fight. The English may destroy "half a town" here and there, and put to death numbers of helpless women aod children, but the population of the Japanese islands, led by the Daiiuios, will not give up the contest. And we are much miatakeu if the Japanese sailors, who are bravo and enterprising, do not presently carry the war outside of their own waters. Bombarding a flourishing sea-port without notice is a very grand achievement, no boubt. But the God of war frowns upon such atroci ties, and f luy seldom lead to any thing but disaster. Harper's Weekly. The loyal Governor ol West Virginia, in his message, say? : "Free the slaves, and when the State is fully restored there will be no need of contention. The people will at once adapt themselves to the new state of affairs. Population and capilol, invited by our mild climate and vast agricultural, mineral, and manufacturing resources, and commercial fa cilities', will immediately flow iuto the State from the North. Tbe State wi ll emerge from the rebellion regenerated, and enter into a noble and successful competition with her sis ter States in all that pertains to the trao ques tion of a free commonwealth.". The claim that the draft has seenred ten million dollars and fifty thousand soldiers. made by Stanton in his annual report, has cre ated a decided surprise. The dmft was onlv enforced in ten States. There i no doubt that, as Stanton says, three fourths of the whole army will re-enlist when their time ex pires. The paymasters re-enlist nearly as ma ny men as they pay off. The Columbus (Gjorgia) Snn says that a country-man offered a cartload of inferior turnips for sale, in that city, the other day, at three for one dollar, or thirty-five cents apiece. He sold the tops separately. These are the kind of men 'who complain of the "high prices." ' General Meagher is not a prisoner.

CLEARFIELD,' PA.. DEC. 16, 1803. MEETIN3 OF CONGRESS. : Both Ilnuses of Congress assembled on Mon day a-week. Tbe galleries were densely crowded long -belore the hour for the opening of tbe session arrived. The Vice President, Mr. Hamlin, called the Senate to order at noon. Rev. Mr. Sunderland offered & prayer expressing the gratitude of the country, that though the storm drives the Republic still lives. ' ' Mr. Davis, from Kentucky, raised tha ques tion as to the right of the gentlemen from Wesn Virginia to take their seats. He held that there was constitutionally and legally no such State as West Virginia, and there could ba, therefore, no Senators from such State. After furter debate, Mr. Davis, as a test ques tion, moved that tho oath of office be adminis tered to the gentlemen from West Virginia Tbe motion was carried yeas 36, nays 6, Mr. Buckalew, of Pennsylvania, voted with the nays. Mr. Lane, of Indiana, gave notice of the introduction of bills to repeal the $300 commutation feature of the enrollment act, and to increase the pay ol non-eoremi6sioned offi cer8 and privates in the army fifty per cent. The Senate adjourned. Te e FJocse. At noon Mr- Etheridge, the Clerk, rapped the members to order, and said, this being the time designated by the Constitution ol the United States for the meet ing of the Thirty-eighth Congress, ho would now proceed to all the roll of members, and of such only wbise credentials show that they were regularly elected, in accordance with the laws of their States respectively, or the laws of the UnitedStates. The Clerk then read the roll of members from all the States except ing Mary land, Virginia, West Virginia, Ore gon, Missouri and Kansas. After some de bate the gentleman from all the excepted States were admitted 'to seats. The next im portant business before the House was the e election of a speaker. Tbe Hen. Schuyler Colfax, Union, from Indiana, waa elected on the first ballot. Whole number ot voles east 181, necessary to a choice tl. Mr. Colfax, 101 Mr. Mallory, ' 10 Mr. Cox, - 42 Mr. Stebbings, 7 Mr. Dawson, 12 Mr. Blair, 2 Mr.King, 6 Mr.Stiles, ' 1 The announcement of Mr. Colfax's election was gteeted with vociferous applause. Mr. Colfax, on taking the chair, said : Gfxtlemex of the lIorE or Representa tives : To-day will be marked in American history as the opening of a Congress destined to face and settle the most important questions of the conntiy, and during whose existence the rebellion, which has passed its culmina tion, will, beyond all question, thanks to our Army ad Navy and Administration, die a deserved death. Not only will your constitu ents watch with the strictest scrutiny your de liberations here, but tbe friends ot liberty, to the most distant lands, will bo interested spectators of your acts. In this greater than Roman forum, I invoke you to approach these grave questions with the calm thoiightlu Iness of statesmen , freeing your discussions from that acerbity which mars instead of advances legislation, and with unshaken reliance on that Divyie Power which gave victory to those who foimed this Union, and can give tveu greater victory to those who are seeking to save it from de.-truc- tion by the hand of tbe parricide and traitor. I invoke you, also, to remember that sacred truth which all history verifies, that "they who nils not in righteousness shall perish from the earth." Thanking you with a greatful heart for this distinguished mark of your confidence and re gard, and appealing to you all lor that support and forbearance by the aid of which alone I can hope to succeed, I am now ready to take the oath of office, and enter upon the duties you have assigned me. The balance of tbe proceedings'of the day were in regard to the admission of members claiming seats from Louisiana and the teri tories. On Tuesday very little was done in the Sen ate. In the House Hon. Edward McPberson, of Pennsylvania, was elected Clerk. On Wednesday, the President's, Message was read in both houses of Congress. It is worthy of remark here, that most of tbe Border State-men voted with the Republi cans for Hon. Schuyler Colfax, for Speaker of the House. Dec. 10. In the Senate, notice was .given of a bill to encourage volunteers in the Naval service, crediting all such to the military quota of the states. Mr. Sumner'gave notice of a bill to repeal all acts for the giving np of fugitive slaves. Adjoruned . to Monday. In tbe House, notice was given of a bill to facili tate the payment ot bounties due on account of deceased soldiers. Mr. Pembeiton gave'no tice of a bill to admit Members of the Cabinet to the Senate and House with the right to de bate matters touching their several depart ments. The Treasury Report was handed in. The House elected a Chaplaio ; the Rev, Wm. H. Chaining, Unitarian, had 80 votes ; Bish op Hopkins of Vermont, author of a Bible De fense of slavery, had 55 ; Mr. Channing was declared elected. Adjounred to Monday. .... At Booneville, Missouri, two hundred negro men were brought in by their owners to be enrolled in the army at $300 per man. So it is in many other parts of the State. They are flocking into the recruiting stations by hun dreds, and will number thousand before the draft takes place. TEE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. We this week occupy a large portion of our space with the President's Third Annual Mes sage. "It is one of the most important docu ments of the times, and will bo read with much interest by all classes. Tbo President treats the various subjects in a terse, pointed and pleasing, and, no doubt, satisfactory man ner, to loyal men generally Perhaps, not in the-history of our country, has it fallen to the lot of any statesman to speak in a crisis more momentous, or to deal with questions of a graver import, or of a more varied charac ter, than the President was called upon to do in this ins-taice. ,' - .;''..' The President sets forth the cheering fact, that our relations with Europe are of the most amicable nature that foreign nations are set tling down to a really neutral position in ref erence to our lutestine difficulties that all questions arising out of the blockade have been satisfactorialy arranged that the treaty in reference to the African slave trade has beea ratified by Great Britian that the ques tion of the coast rights of Cuba, and seizure of property by Chilian naval ofti cers, which have been under discussion for some time, are leading to a favorable adjustment. Tbo course pursued by some of the natural ised citizens ol the L'nited States, in connec tion with our military operations, is referred toby the President. It appears that many naturalized citizens deny their naturalization to escape service in the army and that many come to this country and are naturalized to escape taxation and service i:i ether countries The President thinks that Congress should adopt some measures to prevent this species ot fraud. Congress is also urged to establish some system oy which to encourage emigra tion to the United Ststeii. The heavy demands upon th Treasury, and the successful operations of Secretary Chao in raising the means to pay all the troops in the field, aro a source ot gratitieatteu, ar;i shows forth the great resource of the country, as well as the great alacrity with which those resources are made available. The National Banking Law is also deemed a complete suc cess. The army and navy are highly spfikenof. Our armies nor surpass tbose ot any other nation, and our navy is ejual lo nearly the combined navies of the world, while our mili tary resources are of an almost Inexhaustable character. ' The postal system, heretofore a heavy ex pense to the Government, is now really self supporting, and the revenue Iroiu the sale of public lands, which was materially lessened at the commencement of tbe rebellion, is be ginning to assume iis former importance, by an increased sale of lauds. The rebellion is treated at soru length by the President, who seems determined to brir:g it to a successful close, by adhering to the policy enunciated in the Emancipation Proc lamation, and tbe several acts of Congress. While tbe President is thus firm on this sub ject, he offers terms of peace to all who will throw down their arms end acknowledge the authority ot the Government of the United States, by subscribing to an oath of allegiance. Upon the whole tbe message is an able State paper dignified, frank, brief and com prehensive, and the policy enunciated therein will have much to do with the "weal or woe" of the future of our country with the suc cessful or unsuccessful working-out of the gre problem of popular government. Labor Well Paii. There is no country in the world where labor is so well paid as iu the United States at the present time. The demand for skilled labor is so great as in a measure to defeat tbe requirement of the ar mies in the field, and a competition arises be tween the employes and the Government for the possession of this labor. States and cities, to induce volunteering to raise their required quota, Have to increase the amount of the bounties, and employers, to retain their men, ha7e to add to the amount of their wages. These high prices and high bounties are, how ever, not only attracting large numbers of em igrants from Europe, but the British Prov inces are sending quite a large portion of their laboring population to this country. In the army or in tbe workshop they will find their services adequately paid. Can anybody tell us why it is that we are denounced as "traitors," "rebel sympathi zers," &c., by men who, in former days, cor dially agreed with us on all controverted questions touching the relative powers of the Federal and State Governments V Copper head ore;a. Most certainly. In times of peace all were for the Union uow, in times of war, we are divided into two classes, to wit: War men and Anti-war men Unionists and Secession ists Loyalists and Rebels Patriots and Traitors. Tbose who agreed with you here tofore, we presume, hold to the former class, whilst they consider you as favoring the lat ter, and hence, the designation of "traitors," and "rebel sympathizers." Do you 6ee ? It is plain. Maximilian is getting ready to start for bis new empire. A Vienna letter of November 17 says : "The captaiu of the steamer Eliz abeth has received orders to be prepared to take the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian and the Archduchess Charlotte to Mexico, and it is probable that the frigate Schwarzenberg and tbe sloop Frederick will accompany the above mentioned vessel to her destination." "Now, we aro perfectly sure that our ideas and principles have undergone no change." Copperhead organ. - - ' j Not recently, sure. For your ideas long since centered on the "nigger," and your principles dwindled into Secesh sympathy. Gurley, the guerrilla who murdered Gener. al McCook of Ohio, is on trial at Nashville. Gurley pleaded not guilty, but outside of tbe Court admits having shoTMcCook. "The "stray sheep" that bas broken into the editorial pasture of our neighbor."

"ACKNOWLEDGE THE C0BN." In their issue ot December 9th, the editers of the copperhead organ, in this plaee, admit that "Patriotism can take no Democrat (i. e. Copperhead) to the field." This is just what we have frequently intimated. Whilst But ler, BurnsiJe, Dix, Corcoran, Steadman, Ro secrans, and a host of others, are found in tho Union army battling against treason, such men as Woodward, Lowrie, Frank Hughes, Vallandigham, the editors of the Republican, etc., rwuain at home and try to create dissen sions among the people to aid the rebels Tho first named are true and patriotic Democrats hue others wily copperheads. The termer are trying to restore the authority of the Cousti tution over the States in open rebellion tlfb latter, so far as their puny efforts go, are hin dering the consummation of that much desired end ''Patriotism can take no (copperhead) to the field," but the "nigger" could, accord ing to the declaration qf the editors of the Republican. If the war was for the enslave ment of the whole black race iu tho United States, (we infer from their language,) then they, (the editors,) would l-e found in the froiit ranks of tbe army. Yea.they would not then say "Go" but "Come, boys, t the res cue ot our glorious inheritance" the "nig ger.". Well, we do not envy you your "glori ous inheritance," if such it bo. , l'ou have long bugged it to your bosoms, and are wel come to It. In the language of Governor Brarulette, your "thoughts linger in the shad ow of the negro," and not iu the salvation of tbe Government under which you live. A "glorious inheritance," indeed plenty of "niggers" and a divided UDion, rather than a ret-tcred Government without them. Alas! poor Cops ! what will you do should Govern or Brum letfo"s prognostication,-"that the de struction of slavery may It the result of the war," come true i Would it Kol, iu ht c veui, lj advisable tor you to migrate to Af rica where you could revel in ywr "glorious inheritance" unmolested To that kingd. tu where iiO Lloyd Garrison would haunt your dreams by wight, nor a Wendell Philips your thoughts by day ? To that region where no "Union as it was" not-d be restoied, becuixe no tr ai'or hands have been raised t. destroy it, or trample its flag in the duatf To the realm where the King of Dahomey Mill rules unmolested orer bis sable subjects, and where no "patriotism" would be required to take you "to tb tfjld." of battle Oh ! what a "glorious inheritance." what sweet e'ysian possessions a perfect paradise, that must be ! Long may live the king of Dahomey, and the editors ot the Republican be bis profits. THE WAK NEWS. VTe bave had very litlle news of interfst from mir armies within the la.t week. The Aimy of the Potomac is still in itsoM quar ters oti the north side of the KapidMii. A bahd of rebel guerrillas visited Lovetisville on the Sth, but done very little damage. Longstreet has raised tho siege of Knox ville, and has retired to Morritown. where it is si1 be will make a etand. The rebels ad mit a loss of tiOO in their attack on Knox ville. The siege of'Oharlesfon continues, but noth ing of importance has transpired lately. Du ring tbe storm on the 6th the iron-clad Wee hawfcen sunk suddenly at her anchorage ofl Morris Island, with SO of her crew on board. No other vessels were injured. A daring act of piracy was committed of! Cape Cod on Monday the 7th. Tho steamer Chesapeake was seized by 17 ecesh passen gers, who had gon on boar! at New-York. The chief engineer and mate were wounded, the second engineer killed and thrown over board, and tbe balance ol'thecrew were landed at St Jolin's.X. B. The vessel and cargo are valued at $180,000. Latest advices report the venel at St. Mary's, destitute of coal, where, it is to be hoped, she will bo rf-taken. This is the most daring act of piracy that has accurred during the war. The Cleaveland Leader states that the son of John C. Breckenridge, who was t akeu pris oner at Chattanooga, accompanied the escort of the bodies of Colonel Creigbton and Crane, as far asXashviile,and tht in conversation with Sergent-Major Tisdell, he declared himself in favor of tbe Union. He said that he bad been forced into the Confederate service by his f-itber. Tbe young man thjDks it would be only necessary to put down Hie 'leaders of tbe rebellion to secure a prompt and bouorable peace. I bis statement is made on the author ity of Major Tisdell, who had the coi'Versation with young Breckenridge. NEW ADVERTISEMENTS.

The SecRi Tiitr or tiik Tkeasckv has rot y. t given notice of any "intention to withdraw tbii popular Loan from hale at Par, and until ten days notice is given, tbe undersigned, as Gexm: ai. i hscku-tio.n Age.xt,"'. will continue to supply tbe public.

Tbe larodemand from abroad, and the rupidly increasing home demand for use as the basis for circulation by National Banking Associations now organizing in aJl parts of the country, will, in a very sborl period, absorb tbe balance. Sales have lately ranged from ten to fifteen millions weekly, fre quently exceeding three millions daily, and a it is well known that the Secretary of theTreasury bas ample and unfailing reiouices in the Dutie on Imports and Internal Rev6nue. and in tbe is sue of the Interest bearing Legal Tender Tre. aury Xotes. it is almost a certainty that he wil! not find it necessary, for a long time to come, to seek a market for any ether long or permanent Loans, the interest asd rniNciPAL or wnicn asb 

PAYABLE IS GOLD. Prudence and self interest must force the minds of those contemplating th formation of National Banking Associations, as well as tbe minds of all who have idle money on their hands, to the prompt. conclusion, that they should lose no tiia in subscribing to this most popular Loan It will soon be beyond their reach, and advance tot handsome premium, as was the result with tbs "Seven Thirty-' Loan, when it was all sold ci could do longer be subscribed for at par. It is a Six per Cent Loan, tub I.ntekbst ad Principal pavablb i.v Coi.i. thcs yielding ovek Xise reit Ckst per avm u at the present rats of premium on coin. The Government requires all duties on import to be paid i n Coin ; these duties have for a long time past amounted to over a Quarterof .Million of Hollars daily, a sum nearly three times greater than tbat required in tbe payment of tbe interest on all the 5-2o' and other permanent Loau. "s tbat it is hoped that the surplus Coin in tbe Trea sury, at no distaut day, will enable tbe United Slates to resume specie payments upon all liabil ities. Tbe Loan is called 5-20 from the fact tbat whikt the Bonds may run for 20 years, yet tbe Govern ment bas a right to pay them off in Gold at fr, at any time after 5 years. The Interest is paid half-yearly, vii: nth first days of November and May. Subscribers can have Coupon Bonds, which ar" payable to bearer, and are S50, 5100. $bi0, an-1 S1000; or Registered Bonds of same denomina tions, and in addition, SjOOO, and $10,001). For Banking purposes and for investments of Trust monies the Registered Bonds are preferable- These i-20 s cannot be taxed by i-tatee, citi. towns or counties, and the Government wx on them is only one-and-a-balf percent . on the moiintof income, when the income of tbe holder exceeds Six Hundred dollars per annual : all othr Investments, such as income from Mortgage. Railroad Stcok and Bonds, etc., must pay fro"1 three to five per cent tax on tbe income. Banks and. Bankers throughout tbe Country will continue to dispose of tbe Bonds; " orders by mail. or otherwise, promptly attended to- The inconvenience of a few days' delay in ti delivery of the Bonds is unavoidable, thedtman being so great ; but as interest commences r0 thedayof subscription, no lo.-s isoccasionea. au1 every effort is being made to diminifh'tbedeUy JAY
