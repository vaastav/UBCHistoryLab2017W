MESSAGE. The constitution provides tnat the President shall,"from time to time, give to the Congress information of the state of the Vniou.It is probable that President Grant bud this duty in hia mind when he sat down to write his last Message, and it i t«> be regretted that he had consulted the "state of the Union" so imperfectly llis Message is anything else than elegant, and abounds in bad English. This might be excusa ble in an under .*<** rotary, but in a docu ment heralded forth as having been mler tlu* consideration of the Cabinet, it is abomin.il »le. Still worst» and more objectionable is it,l > lind such a docu ment entirely i'al. t in geographical al lusions. l\r instance the President opens in a sort of grand-eloqnent strain, iu which he sa> " Our thirteen Slat thirty-eight, including Colorado (which has taken tii.* initiatory steps to become a State), an i eight Terri tories, including the Indian J rritory and Alaska, and ex cluding Cok tending fro: On the south we have extended to the » i ilf of Mexico, and on the w -t from the M ississippi to the Pacific.

St. Boris, Dec. 5.—The Grand .fury found an inun-tnient against Gen. Hab cook on 1 i iday evening last, and it would have been relumed to court vosterdav but tor unexpected delay on the part of Urntnet Attorney J)yer. He had been !"d to believe, Tr,.m some of his tele grams, that the Pr* 1 i encrai doaired ti dfnt nod Attumey , . . proceedings at fc>t. Louis to give way to u court of inquiry, " n ^ ^ Î® ? u pportod that, on iliis account, co held the indictments- back from court. . esterday Mr. Dyer left the city, but he will return to-morrow, and the under stunding abont court is that the indict ments will then be announced. Congress. i n the United States Senate yesterday Ex Governor James L. English was admitted to the seat made vacant by the death of O. S. J erry. The organization of the House was announced, and a committee appointed to wait on the President. After the Message was read reports irom Cabinet officers and from the Comptroller of the Currency were * ubmitted. Iu the House Mr. Blaine made a personal explanation in regard to his remarks of Monday. The usual drawing for seats was gone through with, and the Presidents Message read. The Senate adjourned until to • lay, and the House until Friday. The Cincinnati E ,.r a. i , ' / " ,rcr sa J' s : Lord, Lord, how th;s world is given to stealing! Here comes a pension ring in the City of Brotherly Love that has encircled a million ot dollars annually for several years. Of course a representative of the l nited States,a clerk, was one of the thieves. No first class piece of art in stealing from the government can be executed without the inspiration of the approving last touches of a representative of tho I nited States. Of the twenty-six who have held the Speakership of Congress, only six are now living, namely : Hunter, Winthrop, Bmks, Grow, Colfax and Blaine. Hun ter is State Treasurer of Virginia, Banks and Blaine aro in Congress and the others are in private life. The health of Hon. A. H, Stephens of Georgia, is still on the decline. ^ Tilt- Krad« I of flic Hr|iuhliaiii t , Tbc N. Y. '/r.'hune has undertaken to instruct Mr. Blaine, the Republi can leader ia the House and does it in the following flattering style: It will not do for Mr. Blaincto earn estly oppose the Democratic rage for investigation, and yet ho cannot he expected to cooperate m movements clearly intended to destroy his party's chance of winning the Presidential battlo. To know just where to draw tlia line between passive assent to the programme of his adversaries and re sistance to it will tax his utmost sagac ity. If lie programme of cutting down expenses, he will appear to abandon the cause of the minority; if he opposes it, he will be open to the charge of favoring ex travagance. Whatever damages the Administration wifi indirectly dam retd to the Democratic age him, because it will make the vie tory of the Uepubiicatte next year more doubtful, and yet to exert him self to shield the Administration would clearly make him unpopular. If the third term project should still show signs of life, Mr . Blaine could not be expected to leel badly about disclos ures tending to break down the candi dacy of tlcu. Grant, and yet such dis closures would seriously uffect the party, and would therefore call'for Buch excuses of palliation as the Re publican leader in the house could furnish. It is evident that the situa tion is hedged around with the most puzzling dilemma.-. If anybody can lintl a safe way out of them, however, and pluck lautels from these thorns of difficulty, Mr. Blaine is the man. Fer tile in resources, bold and sudden in action, a master of parliamentary strategy, ready in debate and strong in argument, and carrying with him the prestige of six years in the chair, lie will have no antagonist capable ol crossing swords with him, and will often confound the raw and clumsy Democratic majority. As the lawyers say, that story is very good until the otter side appears, We have no apprehensions that Mr, 1 . ... Blaine will not meet his equal from the Democratic side. That he is there, ' we are confident,and that Mr. Blaine's argument in favor of Radicalism and negroism, will be shown to be all de lusive, we have mo doubt whatever. The indictment of Gen. Babcock is all the more significant, in view of the official telegram, jointly signed by the Secretary of the Treasury ami the At torney General, and seat from Wash ington to the United States District I Attorney at St. Louis, on the 2d inst-, I ■'directing him to ute ettry effort t" ' prerent the implication of any innocent i perton in the conspiracy to defraud the Government, but to spare no one who is guilty. It is fair to presume that tie District Attorney obeyed this order from his' official superiors,and used every effort to prevent the implication of any in nocent person; and yet, it seems he did not prevent the implication of Babcock. We have now Tile ImllctinriBX of beurrai tin In < ik. * ; the extraordinary ; spectacle of the Chief Clerk of the ; Treasuiy Department at Washington convicted of conspiracy to defraud the Government, and awaiting sentence to the penitentiary, and the military sec- I retary and most confidential companion ! and friend nf ii.e i)„„; i,..„ I resident ol the Lnitea btatesuniier indictment, in the ; same court, for being concerned ia tlie ; same conspiracy; while several other ; public officers, less important, but of ; no mean grade, have pleaded guilty to ! indictments for being implicated in ' the same fraudulent conspiracy. !

The seller replied, "Why I picked them ujp along the line of the New York & Canada road. Them is only a handful mister. Why the track is lined with champagne bottles all the way from White Hall up.
