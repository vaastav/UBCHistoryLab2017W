The views o members of both houses concerning th message are freely expressed. E speaker Reed said: "It Is exceeding!; disappointing, both In matter and rr.ari ner. That part of the message whlcl relates to the tariff asseverates that the house committee In charge of tha subject has formulated plans and le vised methods which, us a member o' that committee, I have never ever heard proposed. It Is rather an tin usual sensation to learn the deeds o: the committee not In the committee room, but fromi Uie president of th United States. Has that committee ceased In form to be composed of bot! parties, and has it without, even th formality of a word In open ceimmltte Informed the president of Its deterntlna Hon In such a way that the preslden can officially communicate It to the house? How lemg has It been part oi our system that a committee of an in dependent branch, and above all, : committee wnlen controls the purse shall report to congress through the president? Is this the result of hc uniored blending of the nppolntive will the legislative power? It Is bad enough to have tho tariff bill made up by t little coterie, but to have it communi cated to the president before It ever, reaches the committee, still less the house, shows a determination to be moved by no facts and modified by ne arguments, which makes apparent the absurdity of appointing republle-ans or. the committee of ways and means ut all."
