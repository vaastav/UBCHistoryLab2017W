LEON, IOWA SUBSCRIPTION RATES One year $1.50 8ix months 75 Three months .40 Entered as second class matter at the /•eon, Iowa, Postofflce There arc only 20,000 words in the President's message. The Tillinau problem is running a close serond to the race problem. Not a vord on the tariff in the twenty-six columns ol' the president's When lioosevolt gets tired of moving tho cabinet ollieeis around, ho stirs up tlie Panama canal commission. Judge Urosscup, of Chicago, calls lioosevolt's message a crazy quilt. I'or Imps the President thought that Congress needed a Christmas gift. "Leave the circle off! Leave it off!" insists the Chelsea Independent. "(Jive every man an easy chance to vote his honest convictions and no harm will be done.'' Would President Roosevelt consider ed the tilling of a Mormon leader §200 upon the birth of the forty-fifth heir to a man with five wives, in restraint of the anti-suicide idea? A writer in London Truth says that in twenty years America will bo much the greater nation on the Globe. In twenty years'.' Which is much the greatest nation on the globe now? "Of what account would the circle on the ballot have been this year?" asks the Woodbine Chronicle. "To the average voter in Harrison county it would have looked like a deserted rat hole." 'There is no use trying to lay the blame for defective ballots at the last election upon the removal of the circle," asserts the Mt. Vernon Record. The simple truth is that a good many stand patters did not know how to scratch their ballot. Senator Pettus, the oldest member of congress, who was not well at the close of last session was one of the first to arrive on the opening day at the capifcol. He sticks to his pet phrase of telling his colleagues how "young" he is when reference is made to his advanced years. "None of these questions, the tariff, ship subsidies, harbor and labor im provements, the suffrage, the question of the control of corporate interests, ought to be local questions," argues the Deuison Review. "We must get away from selfishness, from pettiness, from provincialism and from prejudice if we are to be good governors ot America." The district court at Washington has just decidjd in favor of the old soldier, in a siinilir case to one that might have materialized in Knoxville some time ago. In the case at bar, the Washington city council rejected the petition of an old soldier who asked that he be chosen street commissioner. The court decided that he was in the right, under the law. Knoxville Ex press. A irroll county hog raiser has given his neighbors an object lesson in the art of making one dollar breed two. Some time ago he paid over §000 for a brood sow, and the neighborhood fore saw immediate disaster. She raised a litter of live pigs, two of which he has sold for $2:i2.r»0 apiece, and has refused $450 lor the remaining three. It is a big rjfit on the original investment, and one, let it be remembered, that evervone could not have made. The West Des Moines school district employes a trained nurse whose busi ness it is to visit certain specified schools, examine the children as to their health, report all eases of physi cally subnormal children, look after the sanitary condition of the school rooms as to light, heating, cleanliness and ventilation and to visit the homes of children that are sick with the view of determining the propriety of admitting other children from such homes. No man can jus ify an act of cruelty to a dumb animal, no matter what the it is is ab great place, creat- circumstances are under which committed. It is a thing that horrent, to humanity and in the heart of the world can find no Humane treatment of all God's nres, given for our service should be accounted a privilege and he who can not appreciate this sentiment is not worthy of the consideration or respect of manly men. The courts may well treat with rigor those who maltreat their horses. We should see altogether 'less brutality in this era of general good feeling. We are educating our young men for idle gentlemen, trj ing to make lawyers, preachers, doctors and clerks out of material that is needed for blacksmiths, carpenters, merchants and other honest "hewers of wood and drawers of water." It- is a mistake and a big one to teach boys and girls to believe that labor is disgraceful and to do nothing for a living is more becoming to society. There are sons and daughters who are now being educated to play the "lead ing lady" and "walking gentleman" in tho great drama of life who will light out for the poor house OE the peniten tiary before the curtain drops on the last sad act of the play to which they have been educated by their too indulgent parents. A tannory in Minneapolis has dem onstrated ihat cattle hides, particularly black Galloways, can be tanned as soft as mink skin. They make elegant floor rugs. The same tannery can make calf skin transparent and give it all the qualities of parchment. The anti-pass law is likely to have an effect on tho legislative session. The flying trips home for over Sunday will this year include a cash consideration to be settled at the ticket window which is calculated to discourage the complete freedom of the travel hereto fore existing, and incline members to expedite business and get home for good. The secretary of agriculture places the value of this year's farm products at $0,701,000,000, an increase of 000,000 over last year, which surpassed any previous year. Tho total is not much less than 885 for each man, woman and child in the country, and the excess over last year is not far from 80 per capita. It cuts our feathers not a ^little to learn that Connecticut beats Iowa in the average yield of corn per acre. That nutmeg state gives the highest aveage of all the states, namely 12.7. Iowa ought to beat Connecticut two to one. The difference is in cultivation. By paying more attention to seed and cultivation Iowa fanners could double their product. Why should they not do it? "All hail to the independent voter," exclaims tho Oxford .1 unction Mirror. "He is here a'ld here to stay. He came with a rush as an unexpected result of the new ballot which omitted the circle at the head of the ticket and proves the oft-made assertion that when a man takes time to think, as he must do under the new system ho chooses the best man rather than the party man, especially in home and county oflices, as tho results of the recent election will show."
