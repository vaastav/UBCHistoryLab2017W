Several of th Indianapolis basketball players do not take kindly to the new basketball rules this year. Purves,- one of the best players In the city, hut who ur fortunately ha? not been reinstated as an amateur, believes that trie new rules regarding the change of scoring goals from field from two points to three points will cause many more fouls to be committed in a game. Formerly this play counted but two po!nt3 and as a goal from foul counts but one point a player will delib erately make a foul to prevent an oppo nent from scoring a goal from field. This can easily be done In a game of basketball by shouldering, tripping, striking, kicking or unnecesary roughness. If the score of the two teams Is close and the game impor tant attempts to foul will be frequent when a player has a good opportunity to make a goal from field. By committing the foul It will Rive the opposing side an opportun ity to try for goal from foul, which if made will count but one point. Excepting the change in' the scoring the new rules are practically the same as last year. One change provides that if the ball is batted, rolled, bounded or passed from the field of play it shall be given to the opponents at the point where it left the field. Carrying the ball from the field also constitutes a foul. XXX Never before in the history of the Short ridge High School has interest In basket ball been at such high pitch among the young women of the school than It Is this year. Miss McClellan, a teacher In the school, has assumed the management of the first team and with the aid of Mis3 tSladys Nehrba, who is captain, a strong club has been organized. The make-up of the other teams has been put largely In the hands of Miss Nehrbas and she has picked five teams out of sixty young women applicants. For some time the young women have been without a place to practice. The old stable in the rear of the school, which Mr. Wright promised to repair for the use of the players, has been condemned by the building inspector. Since this order was issued the players have had no place to practice. The ques tion was taken to the superintendent of schools, who promised to bring the mat ter before the board. Miss Nehrbas has tecurea me x. w . c a. gymnasium ior practice. The girl3 will practice Mon days and Thursdays and Mr. George Reeves will act as coach. This is for the first team, however. A practice ground for the' remaining teams has not yet been found and it is likely that the School Beard will provide a place. Already challenges have been received from the Girls Classical School and the . Normal School for games. If the basket ball team is organized among the girl stu dents of the M. T. II. S. the girls in tha Shortridge High School first team will fend a challenge with a view of wiping cut the defeat of the football team, it is fcald. There is some rumors of the girls of the M. T. II. S. organizing a basketball team, but as yet nothing has materialized. Following Is the personnel of the girls' " ' clubs of tne Shortridge High School. rirsi team .miss ijiauys .Ntnroas, cap tain and right forward; Nora Lacey, left forward; Ruth Maxwell, guard; Ethel Dor tey, center; Louise Zwick, guard; Grace Thilputt. substitute guard; Lydia Wallace, substitute guard; Rachel Baker, substitute forwaru; Kthel Reeves, substitute guard; Margaret Lockwood, center.

There will be a double header in the Y. M. C. A. gym naslum between the first Y. M. C. A. team and a five composed of other players who are memb rs of the Meridian-street M. E. Church and who are members of the Y. M. C. A. The second game will be between the second Y. M. C. A. team and the first team from the Manual Training High Hchool. In the contest with the first team Manager Purvis will give to the Meridian street five a handicap of fifteen points This will cause the members of the Y. M C. A. team to do some great playing to overcome the lead. It was announced last week that in all games played by the first Y. M. C A. team with clubs outside of the league the second team would also play a preliminary Käme, making each contest a double header. Manager Itaum:in, of the frecond team, has lost several of last year's team, who are now trying for places on the lrst team. 1 j The league season is to open Dec. II. and fill the player of the leasue are now work ins hard to get Into condition for the open Sng game. The two high schools since the Close of the football season are putting all their strength tt basket bill and are hard .it work on their training days in the gym nasium. The players from the South Side ehool practice every Wednesday and Fri day afternoons, while the Shortridge play ers practice on Tuesday and Thuiduy f ternoons. Holdson, who played a wo;i flcrful game on lat year's Shortridge team, is captain of thU year's five and is now Jiard at work with about twenty new can didates breaking them In for positions on the team. Each ten in in the league has a large surplus of candidates, and from pres ent indications no team will be called com plete until n-ar the clos? of the playing Reason. It is the purpose of each captain and manager to use all the substitutes by ticking from them fives fur different Sanies. There are, however, players who made good reputations in last year's league, and theae will find a place in tho Kumes this year. One of the old players it U thought will remain on the team each fight during the .playing season and In this Way coach the new material. XXX j On Dec. 17 the Y. M. C. A. team will play , he? Connersvilb five in this city. It is said that the Connersvllle team represents a t tron and swift lot of players. During lae holidays g.imes have Neil arranged Isith Chuinn ti I'niversity and Y.

Two teams have been practic ing in the gymnasium for the past month, during which time several new players have shown a thorough knowledge of the game. The material from which to pick the team this year Is far larger and more experienced than in any previous year. A close rivalry which exists between several of the classes, especially the freshmen and preps, has brought a large number or men out in order to make the class teams. This has aroused considerable rivalry for positions on the first team. Each posi tion now is being fought for by several candidates. The first team will not be picked until the day before the first game, which Is with the Training School next Saturday evening. Emmett S. Huggins is captain of the team. This is his third year on the team, playing the position of for ward or center. This year he will probably play right forward. Although it was thought that the loss of McGaughey would badly cripple the team, it is now believed this year's team will be fully as fast as last year's. The most promising candi date for McGaughey's position (center) is Tongley. He is over six feet tall. and. al though new at the game, is fast developing into a steady, reliable player. Paul Murray, without a doubt, will play left forward. He played on the team last year and is considered the surest man at throwing baskets. He is fast and aggressive. For the guards position there is the greatest rivalry. The fight Is between Butler, Blair, McIIatten, Kingsbury, Davenport, Long and Barnett. Butler played on last year's team and Blair has had several years' practice, while the other men are prac tically new at the game. Some of the other most promising candidates for the team are Wilson, Brown. Adams, Dyer, Dodson, Hall, Thornbury, Shimer, Whistler, Güttin, Mauzy and Martin. Frank B. Long is manager and Robert Tomllnson assistant manager. Besides the league games the management has arranged the following fixed dates: Butler vs. Indiana University on orator ical day, Feb. 8, at Indianapolis. Butler vs. Purdue, at Indianapolis Jan. 25. Butler vs. Indiana University, at Bloom ington Feb 22. Butler vs. Purdue, at Lafayette March 1. Besides these games there are games, for which dates have not been decided on, with Rose Polytechnic, Franklin, Wabash, De Pauw, Hanover and State Normal. A southern trip through Ohio, Kentucky and Illinois is also being planned. XXX By the vote of Yale, Harvard, Princeton and Cornell, Columbia has been admitted to the Intercollegiate Basketball Association.

All Kintls of Machine Will lie In hibited Here In February. The committee having In charge the au tomobile and bicycle show, to be given in Indianapolis the third week in February, met last evening and perfected part of the plans for the big exhibition of motor vehi cles. Frank Staley is permanent chairman and Carl G. Fihcr is secretary and treas urer of the committee. Others interested In the show are A. C. Newby, H. 0. Smith and George C. Detch. There has never been a show of this kind held in Indian apolis but at the meeting of the commit tee last night It was decided that every effort should be made to give a successful one. The Indianapolis show will be held Just prior to the big show in Chicago and Indianapolis will get many of the exhibits that will be shipped west for the Chicago show. Every kind of automobile or motor ma chine manufactured in the country will be on exhibition during that week. In addi tion to the machines for commercial and business use there will also be shown two, Ihree and four wheelers, racing machines and all kinds of "freaks" in the motor line. There will also be various tests with automobiles and men who have become ex pert chaffeurs will give exhibitions of their skill in hlll-cllmblng. running through mud, dodging obstacles while going at hinh speed and stopping suddenly, avert ing accidents. "Several ef the big racing men. Including Fournlere. will be asked to come here. The show will probably be held in Tomllnson Hall. INDOOR CYCLE RACES. Twenty-Mile Irofelonnl Event Won by Frank Kramer. NEW YORK, Dec. 7. The winter indoor cycle season bgan at Madison-square Garden to-night.

CITY CLUB TEAM CHOSEN PLAYER? "WHO "WILL ENTER THE It IT" FA LO TOtnXAMENT. Delegation Will Try to Secure Con- Kren to Mert Hrre Delegaten Ap- poluteil HovtIIiikT 'ew. Since the Journal first mentioned and suggested last week the possibility of se curing the National Bowling Congress to meet in Indianpolls In 1903 the Indianapolis bowlers have taken the matter in hand and an effort will be made to securs the congress fo; this city. When the Marlon and City Club teams go to Buffalo for the national tournament Jan. 20 to 25, they will be accompanied by William A. Bogardus, deputy city controller, the Marlon Club's secretary; John G. Kirk wood, president of the Marlon Club; P. A. Havelick, president of the Indianapolis Bowling League; Mayor Bookwalter, City Clerk Elliott, Armin C. Koehne, county treasurer; Edward D. Logsdon, of the Board of Works; "Baron" Rothschild, financial manager of the Mar ion team, and many other bowling rooters and city officials who will be interested In securing the National Bowling Congress to meet In Indianpolls the next annual meeting following the Buffalo meeting. As already mentioned the congress and national tournament will likely be held In a Western city after the Buffalo meet and Indianapolis should get it as it would bring nearly bowlers and strangers to the city for a week. As previously mentioned the Marlon team to go to Buffalo will be composed of Ben Brown, M. C. Knox, T. J. Carter, R. 11. Bryson, Albert Leap and Leonard Quill. The personnel of the City Club team to enter the Buffalo contest was completed yesterday and will be composed of the fol lowing bowlers: Charles Oardner and Iee Graff, of the Ramblers; Cliff Allen, of the Prospects; Fred Comstock. of the Capital Citvs; Iluchanan, of the Tish-i-Mingos, and Marshal Ixvy, of the Capital Citys. The team is composed of bowlers of the In dianapolis and Independent Leagues and are among the best in the city. The City Club team, like the Marions, will enter every contest and may also arrange for several match games. Gardner and Graff will be open to bowl any two-men team at the tournament, a series of ten games, total pins to count, for any amount up to President Havelick. of the Indianapolis League, said last night that he will go to Buffalo, but will not act as a delegate of the Indianapolis League. He will appoint Captain Bryson. of the Marion team, as delegate, and Albert Leap as alternate. President Baron, of the Independent League, will appoint Charles Gardner as delegate from the Independent League, and Cliff Allen or Lee Graff as alternate. Independent Lenßue. Graff still leads the Independent League bowlers with an average that is higher than any in the city. Buchanan and Allen are tied for second. The averages fol low: Graff.

The Shortridge Bowling League again bowled on the Pastime alleys yesterday morning. The best team average was made by the Delectables, who scored 724. This team took three games from the Tren- tons, and the Hoot Möns lost three to the Mayers. The standing of the clubs is as follows: Delectables first, Mayers and Hoot Möns tied for second and Trentons last. Bowling Is becoming very popular in the school and many excellent bowlers are de veloping among the students. Howling; Notes. A picked team of bowlers went to Green- castle last night. There are seventy-one bowlers above the 160 mark In the Indianapolis League. Williams, of the Marions, is still playing In hard luck by making several splits in each game. Ben W. Brown. I. B. L. champion of 

ISI'9-IDOO, new leads the league by about fifteen pin?, with Lew Cooper second. The Capital Citys came out in new uni forms Friday night. Their sweaters are maroon with a white "C C" for a mono gram. . The contest for the box of cigars given "away weekly at the City Club for the high est score was exciting last week. The high est score was 2G6. Frank Burton, of the Ko-We-Bas, who was first picked as one of the City Club team to go to Buffalo, will not be able to make the trip on account of business. Buchanan, of the Tish-I-Mingoes, has been playing a great game lately. He piled up a 216 score last week. He Is getting Into good condition for the Buffalo tournament. The members of the Marion and City Club teams that will go to Buffalo next month will practically live on the alleys from now until the time they leave for Buffalo. The owners of bowling alleys In Indian apolis are all in favor of the move to se cure the National Bowling Congress to meet In Indianapolis and will support It liberally. About twenty members of the Marlon Club will accompany the team to Buffalo next month. It is expected that there will be nearly fifty rooters on hand from In dianapolis. Ed Wickard, formerly of the North Side Club, has Joined the Prospects. The latter team has been greatly strengthened lately and will make the rest of the Independent League clubs hustle to win. The City Club team that has been select ed to enter the national tournament con tests want games with any five-men team in the city in order to get all the practice possible before going to Buffalo. Cliff Allen had an off night last week and took a big drop In the average column. He has only rolled a few games In the In dependent League and consequently will have a chance to go to the front easily. FOOTBALL TALKED DOWN. Condemned at Debate by Chicago Uni versity Freshmen. Football was alternately scored and lauded, says the Chicago Tribune, by the freshmen of the University of Chicago at a debate held last Tuesday night on the question: "Is Football Advantageous as a College Sport?" After a spirited forensic battle, In which interest on both sides ran high, the decision, rendered on the merits of the debate, was against football as a college sport. The decision did not pleas0 a majority of the students present, and Prof. Chandler, the judge who rendered the decision, openly declared himself a friend of the game, in spite of his decision. Dur ing the heat of the elebate PMson Cook, a player on the Maroon team, was called out by the football enthusiasts to defend the game of which he was a devotee. The gavel was in the hand of a coed, Miss Louise Bearse. "The spirit of the football game is a bulldog spirit, a prize fight spirit," said F. L. Cummings, of the team for the nega tive side of the question. "It is a spult like that of the gladiatorial days of Rome. I can speak from experience, because I have been a football player myself, and I like the game too. Ihe players are sent In to hurt their opponents. The coaches shout: 'Go after them; tear them up.' AfttT the end of the first half of a game the coaches say to their men who have not been playing liercfly: "What is the mat ter with you? Lay your man out. Do him up. Lay for him. That is the sort of spirit they teach. If you don't believe the players go in for that sort of thing, just watch them. How can we expect to de velop men of intellectual attainments in our colleges when they are sent Into a football game to run against their oppo nents and 'kill them off?' " Football may be full of opportunities for mean things, but players do not take advantage of them," said Miss Clara Dtn ham, a debater on the opposite side of the question. "If players cannot win by fair means they will win by foul." said Miss Frieda Meyer. "1 know of a university professor who says that no football players in his class fail. In many colleges a football man who does not get through his classes nowadays is a pretty poor player." "Football Is a good thing for the players, because It helps them endure defeat," said W. K. Morehead. a debater for the affirm ative. Iot-Senson Kootliull. The Wisconsin football team Is out of debt and has $1.500 in the treasurj'. The receipts this year amounted to nearly X10,- m. George W. Woodruff has resigned as head coach of the University of Pennsyl vania and will coach the University of California. There has been much criticism against Wodruff at Philadelphia this yea-. Athletic relations between the universi ties of Michigan and Chicago are hanging in the balance pending the outcome of peace negotiations between representatives of ihe two schools. The University of Michigan still claims its inalienable right to an annual football game in Chicago, while Chicago Is unalterably opposed to such a game. There is a chance of Chi cago and Michigan walking in different paths In the future unless a compromise is agreed upon. Correspondence has passed between Yale University and the University of Penn sylvania loking toward a resumption of athletic relations. Many Yale stuuents are in favor of a football game with the Uni versity of Pennsylvania, next year. Ihl Kiippn In l!nniuet. NEW YORK. Dec. T.-At the annual ban quet of the Phi Kappa I'sl fraternity, held Ihis evening at the Waldorf-Astoria, the semi-centennial of the organization was corrmemoratd. Of the thirty-nine active chapters thirty were represented by about 125 persons. letters of regret were read from Senator Foraker. oi Ohio, former Governor ljwndes. of Maryland, Congress man Bingham, of Pennsylvania, and others. WESTERN TALK A BLUFF II1CKEY TAKES XO STOCK IN MAX MSG'S INVASION TALK. lie Sny the American Amiorintion Could Win In n FIhM-Wntklwa SIkum YVooelriifT CiOHslp. Manager Watkins received a letter from President Hickey, of the American Asso ciation, yesterday, in which Hickey said that there need be no fear of the Western League entering the American Association territory. Hickey says that James Man ning Is back of the Western League and that organization's policy to try and enter cities selected by the American Associa tion. Manning is backed by a wealthy St. Joseph (Mo.) man, who wants to see the Western League play in big cities in order to further his Interests In St. Joseph. President Hickey says the American As sociation will' begin the season of 1902 with the same cities forming the circuit that were announced at the Chicago meeting week before last. He does not believe that Omaha will be out of the circuit. There has been a great deal of talk of Omaha withdrawing; or, rather, Rourke, who now owns the American Association franchise, pulling out of the organization, but Hickey believes that Manning and his colleagues have frightened Rourke, who, unfortunate ly, is not gifted with an overabundance of baseball political knowledge, and that he does not know exactly what he wants to do. Manning has no doubt pictured to Rourke that he could make more money in a little minor Western League than he could in the new American Association, and Rourke has no doubt drunk In the words of "wisdom" of Manning, and wants to get out of an organization that would be a hundred per cent, better to him than the one Manning wants him to ally with. President Hickey says that if Rourke still insists on leaving the American Association there are men with a great deal of capital in Omaha who are very willing to secure a franchise In the new organization, and, if necessary, place a team in Omaha anel tight any Western League team that Rourke may deem to place in Omaha. Hickey says that if it comes to a war between the West ern and American Association that the lat ter would drive the minor organization to the wall before the season opens. Hickey claims he helped the Western League to re organize for this season, but there are a few men in the league, backed by Manning, who stem to think it would be wise to fight the American Association and go into pome of the cities chosen by the new organiza tion. Regarding the Western League placing clubs in St. Paul and Minneapolis and even In Kansas City, Manning's eld home, Hickey says it is absurd, as the baseball public of those cities were sickened on the minor league article of ball last year and want to see their cities in a better organi zation, such as the new American Asso ciation. It is easy enough to understand why St. Paul, Minneapolis anel Kansas City should be tired ot poor baseball as Indianapolis had a sample of it last year and a comparison of the Western League and new American can be drawn the same as between the Western Association of last year and the new American. Patrons of baseball In the Western cities will support the new organization over the Western League the same as Indianapolis patrors would support Watkins and his club In the American Association against a team in the Western Association composed of Marlon, Dayton, Fort Wayne et al. Wat kins is in favor of keeping the American Association circuit intact and does not be lieve that the Western League could injure it in the least even If Manning and his crowd are foolish enough to try and wage war against the new organization. xxx Manager Watkins, who is one of the most conservative baseball men in, the coun try, eliscusses freely the proposed invasion of the Western League into American Association territory. He does not take much stock in Manning's proposed war fare and believes that Manning and his followers are only bluffing in their threats to place clubs in Omaha. Kansas City, St. Paul and Minneapolis. He says, however, that If the Western ' League insists upon entering the territory selected by the new organization that the American Associa tion must hold its ground and force the foolish fellows out. He is in favor of re taining Omaha. xxx Manager Watkins said yesterday that he has signed Orvil Woodruff, outfielder and catcher, who played in the New York State League last year. Weiodruff lives in Cin cinnati and several National and American League teams have been after him. He is a catcher and outfielder. Watkins says it is a little too early to begin talking of the personnel of the team for next year, as the snow has not yet fallen. The public knows of but thret men who are now under con tractFox, Meyers and Woodruff but still Watkins promises a good team. Meyers will play first, as Kelly will again be in St Paul, where he went after leaving Indian apolls. it Is not at all unlikely that Hey don. Bey, Flynn, Hogrlever, Sutthoff and other ex-Hooslers will again wear Indian apolis uniforms next year. Bey went to Cincinnati, and, as Brush has seven out fielders, it may be possible to secure the fleet little center fielder for Indianapolis Hogrlever Is on his farm in Wisconsin, and. providing he agrees to lessen nis uemanus. he may come to Indianapolis. Heydon has not been signed, and there has been a re port that he will go to the Southern League, but this has not been confirmed. It would not be surprising if Kellum. who jumped to the American League last year, will be back in Indianapolis again in 1)2. There will be several old faces as well as several new ones in the Indianapolis team in 1902. As far ns the outside world is concerned the meeting of American League magnates at Chicago last week was a most harmoni ous affair. The reports say tne men met. and, while they did not wrap themselves in each other's embraces or shed tears at parting, there was a general love feast This may and may not be so, but it is not believed that Klllilea and Gross, of Mil waukee. went to Chicago with any idea of allowing the Johnsonians to rub the Mex lean salve on them so thick that they would give up their American League fran chise without a struggle. St. Louis parties desired to buv the Milwaukee franchise. but the Brewers wanted SiO.uoo for it in order to make even on losses, which made the St. Louis prospective buyers return to the tunnel. In order to keep peace Matt Klllilea and Gross decided to mine their bag. baggage and entire outfit to St. Louis to pitch camp early next spring. By invading St. LouU the American League will be established next year In four cities where National League clubs are located Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and St. Louis and it is plainly seen that the talk of a compromise that emanated in Chicago last fall is more distant than ever. The American League will also go after holidav dates, and will schedule the best of them In cities where the National League will play. The outcome; of the whole business is a matter that cannot be conjectured at this time. xxx The meeting of the National League this month will be interesting, and the baseball world will soon learn just what steps the major organization will take to retain what little prestige it still holds, and what meth ods will be pursued, If any, to recover lost ground. The war last season between the two big Leagues was costly, and the Na tional League clubs had to b-ar the large part of the exponso. With opposition In another cltv the coming seat on there will be surely "something doing." and the National League fathers may have to dig deeper. The National league ten-year agreement expired this fail, ami when the League Is reorganized there may be steps taken to fight the American League in a manner that may accomplish results. Man! baseball men stiil believe that had John f. Rogers, of Philadelphia, been banished to an Island during the summer of 19V the American Association, as plann d bi W. II. Watkins. to include the big Easter a cities and act as an ally to the NationpV League, would have prevcntesl the Amer lean League from invading the Easter cities and would have driven it to the wal'$ Rogers, however, prevented Watkins anS his colleagues from entering r-hiladeipht4 with the result that the American Leagu? secured a foundation in that city built upo rock and not upon sand. Getting into Phi adelphia enabled the Johnson crowd to g5 into other Bastern cities, with the result that is well known. XXX ' It would be a hard matter for the Na tlonal League to get rid of Rogers, of Philadelphia, although there would be n:i tears shed if he would be ousted. But th chances are that he will not sell out, an If some one else would be given the Nn tional League franchise in Philadelphia when the League meets to reorganize h'- would join the American League rank and there would be no suitable place fo: the National League to place a team iC the Quaker Citv. There is a wonderful absence of news from the East in National League circhs. and baseball men are won; dering Just what will be sprung at th meeting in New York next Tuesday. Thery will probably be no compromise betwert the National and American leagues thli year, as It looks as if Johnson s crowd does not care to compromise. The Ameri: can League is on an equal footing now; and should a compromise be effected at the close of next reason it is more than possible that Johnson and his colleagues will be able to name their own termr. They are In some of the best cities now: and it is safe to say that they will not give them up to the National League unj less there is an equal division of the bes-. territory. XXX t It is said that President Hart, of th.J Chicago National League club, will go be fore the meeting next Tuesday prepared to fight for peace between the two organizar tlons. Just how much weight his plear? will have will be seen later, but it is not believed that there will be any compro mise made this year. The National Leanuv is whipped now, but it will likely wait until the American League has made a better job of it and will then have to accept tne American's terms of compromise. XXX The American League has already prom ised not to tamper with men who have signed American Association contracts This agreement has already been jostleef by the new St. Louis American Leaguo team by signing Pitcher Dunham with Dayton last year. Bryce, of the Columbuf vmencan Association team, claims he has Dunham's signed contract to play in Co lumbus. If he can show the contract 11 is believed that St. Louis will have to re linquish claim to him or demonstrate that Johnson's rule was not made in true faiths XXX The American Association Is threatened with opposition In Kansas City, as James Manning, who lost his money in Washing ton in the American League last year and was practically dumped by that organiza tion, as Johnson cares nothing for men who "have no money, says he will place a Western League team in Kansas City. The American Association will not give up Kansas City, and neither will It re linquish claim on Omaha. Both are good cities for the new organization, and it would be foolish to get out of them. Rourke, of Omaha, who has a whole lot to learn in baseball, claim? that he will give up his American Association franchise and go to the Western League. If President Hickey still retains Rourke's $500 guarantee to stay in the American Association it Is likely that Rourke will change his mind and remain in the new organization. lllokey May He Expelled.
