VOL. XXIII MANNING, S. C. WEDNESDAY, DECEMIBER 16, 1908 NO.17 SOME HOT STUFF Teddy Brands Two Prominst Ed itos as Mendacious Liars. PANAMA CANAL DEAL Makes Roosevelt Very Mad, and He Hands Around the Lie Right and Left But He Does Not Throw Any Light on the Matter Under Dis cussion. White House, Washington. Dec. 1,'1908. My Dear Mr. Foulke: I have re ceived your letter of the 29th ultim and have read it in connection with your previous letters enclosing quotations from the Indianapolis News, a paper edited by Mr. Delavan Smith. The News states in one of its Issues that probably some of the documents dealing with the matter have been destroyed. This is false. Not one has been destroyed. It states that the last documents were sent over in June of this year, the object of this particular falsehood being, apparently, to connect the matter in some way with the nomi nation of Mr. Taft. As a matter of fact, the last papers that we have received of any kind were sent over to us in May of 1904, and they have been accessible to every human be ing who cared to look at them ever since, and are accessib e now. * * * You quote the News- a~stating that "the people have no official knowledge concerning the Panama Canal deal." The fact Is that the people have had the most minute 1 offcial knowledge; that every im- t portant step in the transaction and 1 every important document have been made public in c'ommunications to 8 Congress and through the daily a press, and the whole matter has been threshed over in all its details again t and again and again. * * e The fact has been officially pub lished again and again that the a Government paid $40,000,000,000, i and that It paid this $40,000,000 di- .I rect to the French Government, get- b ting the receipts of the liquidator appointed by the French Government ( to receive the same. The United z States Government has not the n slightest knowledge as to the partic ular individuals among whom th-e e French dGovernment distributed the f eum. This was the business of the c French Government. The mere sur position that any American received f from the French Government a b "rake off" is too absurd to be dis- n cussed. a It is an abominable falsehood, and o it is a slander, not against the Amer ican Government, but against the Freac'h Government. * * * The President's brother-In-law was invrolved in no 'scandal. .Mr. Dela- ~ van Smith and the other people who repeated this falsehood .lied about the President's brother-in-law; but why the fact that Mr. Smith lied shonld be held to involve Mr. Robin-. son in a "scandal" Is difficult to understand. The scandal affects no d one but Mr. Smith; and 'ais conduct - has been notsmerely scandalous, but ~ infamous. Mr. Robinson had not the slightest connection of any kind, sort d or description at any time or under -any circumstances with the Panama matter. Neither did Charles Taft.* * * * So far., as I know there was no syndicate; there certainly was no syndicate in the United States that b to my knowledge had any dealings b with the Government direet'y or indirectly; and, in.ismuch as there ~ was no syndicate, Mr. Taft naturall-' I could not bel-ng to it. The News ~ demands that Mr. Taft appeal to. the evidence by wshich it mneanst what it calls "the records." * * * All of th.se documents that pos-|? sessed any importance as illustrat .Ing any featuire of the transactionls|I have already been made publiej There remains a great mass of docu- j menta of lit'!e or no importance which the Admihistration is entire- O ly willing to havo published. but j which because of their mass ani pointlessness, nobod'y has r'ver caredj to publish. Any reputable man canr have full access to these do'u ments. * * * * Mr. Delavan Smith is a conspice ! ous offender against the laws of!| hones'y a1nd teut ifuln'e, b-it hi | does not stand alone Hie oceuplos for Instance, the same evil emine-ic' with such men as Mr. Laffan, of th' New York Sun, editriia of whos( paper you or others have from tim t6 time called to my attention, just as you have called to my attentior these editorials of the Inc~ianapollE News. Of the editorials thus sen~ - me there is hardly one which does not contain some wilful perversion of the truth. 'Mr. Roosevelt quotes for an ex ample his re :ent statement in replM' to a Ne-w Ynrk Sun storv. entcitk-ed "Roosevelt and Prarie Oil," and t.oen* continues:) The fact is that these particulaT newspapers habitus'ly and continu ally and as a matter of business prajetice every form of mnendaci*.y known to man from the suppression of the truth and the suggestion o1 the false to the lie direct. Those who write or procure others to writ*. ths: articles a-e 'engaged in tit practice of mendacity for hire, andi surely there can be no lower form of gaining a livelihood. Whether them are paid by outsiders to say what i4s false, or whether profit comes from the circulation of the falsehoods, i. a matter of small consequence. It is utterly impossible to attempt to answer all of their falsehoods' V 'hen any given falsehood is exposed -they sinmply repeat it and circulate anoth -7.

TEDDY USURP POWER HAD NO RIGHT TO TEAR DOWN BUILDING. Col. Brownwell Claims He Cited Fact of Lack of Authority, Roosevelt Giving Direr. Order, Anyhow. Washington, Dec. 11.-Attention was called today to the fact that the utterances of the President in re gard to the action of Congress in limiting the use of the secret service force is not the only action of the executive that is considered by mem bers as objectionable. It became known today that the sub-committee of the committee on appropriations, having in charge the preparation of the legislative, execu tive and judicial appropriation bill. has been investigating the raising of. the old Pennsylvania station that was located on the Mall until the President had it torn down. That the committee failed to ex punge its inquiries about this action from the printed hearings is takea o indicate the temper of that com nittee toward the executive. When Col. Bromwell, military aide :o the President, and superintendent >f public buildings and grounds, ap ?eared before the committee Regrc sentativeBurleson, of Texas, asked t ii if he had not requested an ap propriation last year for a watch nan for the old depot. "I think so," replied Col Brom- C ell, "but I have not had any oc ation to use it, because I have torn [own the railroad station." "What? Torn down the railroad t t tion!" exclaimed the Texas mem- r Col. ' well explained that he n ore down the ing on the writ en order from the President of the d Xnited States. ' t 'Do you know of any law on the q tatute books that authorizes any t ecutive officer to sell any of the n roperty of the United States of 1 hat character, real estate?" inquir d Chairman Tawney, of Minnesota . "No, sir," replied the President'.r f ide. "I called the attention of the e igher authorities to that fact, and received the order to tear the h ullding down." Replying further to the chairman E ,ol. Bromwell said that he knew et " o immediate necessity for its re- -1 aoval. a The committee also went into an zamination of the government of- P eials to ascertain what right the C, ammission on country life appoint- g d by the President, had to use the s ranking privilege, as it claimed was b eing done. Members of the con- 1) fittee referred to the qbmmision s "one created without authority si f law." *s h

WILL GET EVEN The Wounded Religious Fanatic Swear Vengeance on Officers HE PLANS REVENGE On Police of Kansas City, Who Shot Him in Street Row-A Pitable Story of Fanaticism and Supersti- 1 tion Told by One of the Dupes of the Holly Rollers. Kansas City, Dec. 11.-"I am not going to die. I am going to get well and live to kill a few more police men." That Is the assertion of Louis Pratt, self-styled "Adam God," tht. religious fanatic, who is lying in the t eneral hospital, seriously wounded t in a battle between his followers an i :he police Tuesday night. As a result of the fight Pratt's 13-year-old daughter, Lula, and t oliceman Alber 0. Dalbow are dead f mnd two other policemen are in a -ritical condition. James Sharp, known as "Elijah I," and who was the real leader of c he little band of religious enthusi- I Lsts, is still at large. Shortly after the shooting Tues- F lay he walked into a saloon, laid b town his revolver with the remar<, 1 -I am satisfied; I give up." t As there was no policeman present a .nd no one seemed inclined to take b Lim into custody. Sharp waited a p soment, then picked up the weapon. g eloaded it and walked out. He has c Lot been seen since. Mrs. Pratt, with two of her young c aughters, spent Tuesday night in f he -matron's room at police head- t1 uarters, but Mrs.: Sharp, who fireu a wo of the shots that struck Police- k ian Michael Mullane, was confined a a the city jail. a "I've been in trouble before," said g Irs. Pratt, and if I can be killed )r righteousness sake I shall be p ternally happy." p Mrs. Pratt bemoaned the death of d er other daughter, Lula, aged 13, w -ho was shot during the second p tage of Tuesday's battle when the tE -oman and her children pulled off w i a rowboat in the Mississippi river is nd attempted to escape. n At the hospital it was said that y atrolman Mullane had small w Nance of recovery, but that Ser- n, eant Patrick Clark's condition was b ightly improved. A. J. Selsor, the 01 y-stander, who was hit by a stray ullet. also is expected to get well. Mary Pratt, the little 11-year-old ster of the dead girl, displayed the A tme remarkable coolness shown by er leaders when questioned by the )ice. She did not cry when told her sister's death. Mrs. Pratt, in a statement to the asistant prosecutor, told of thet and's work. "Mr. and Mrs. Sharp. d; ar leaders," said Mrs. Pratt. "were Ic nown to us as Adam and Eve andi ni e believed their teachings, It was realed to Mr. Sharp last summer p: at our meetings were not to be di terfered with again. We armed G< arselves.

[ shall try to have them reached said President Roosevelt in speaking this afternoon about "those Ameri pans who have been guilty of infa nous falsehood concerning the ac uisition of the property and the :onstruction of the Panama Canal .tself." It was to the committee of one iundred of the Lakes-to-the-Go.. l )eep Waterway Association, headed i >y Governor Deneen, of Illinois, who ere received by the President in he East room of the White House, hat he made this declaration. Governor Deneen had presented a t opy of resolutions adopted by the tssociation, and made a few remarks o which the President' replied as f ollows: "I have felt, as the Governor has t yell put it, that no more important r ervice could be rendered to this t ountry than the building of -e anama Canal between the Atlantic 1 nd the Paeific, and one thing I am roud of in connection with the s uilding of that canal is that there s as not been legitimate cause for h he breath of scandal connected with ny feature of the proceeding.

Valdosta, Ga., Dec. 12.-Parties who came here last night from Statenville, in' Echols county, brought some rather meager detais )f the. exciting experience which the family of Mr. Fisher Belote had ar. he hands of a negro desperado who an amuck during the previous night mnd bblted into the house where the nembers of the family were sleep ng. The negro was evidently one who iad had some trouble with Mr. Be ote and, after becoming drunk at L negro frolic, later went to the vhite man's home for trouble. The negro first broke open the loor of his home and rushed into he room where the wife and sick laughter were sleeping, exclaiming: "I want old Fisher Belote," and [ring three shots from his revolver nto the roof. Mrs. Belote, who kept ter nerve remarkably well, told the tegro that Mr. Belote was not in he room. The negro then stumbled to the ted where the sick daughter was ving, catching her by the foot and 1 aying: "Here he is," and at the ame time firing two shots into the 'ad of the bed. By that time, Mrs. Belote had otton out of the bed and secure. be rifle and was calling her hus- < and from the adjoining room t., ome and shoot the negro. A young r son, Harper.

Colon, Dec. 12.-A giant blast. of dynamite, already prepared for fir ing, was prematurely exploded in the workings at Bas Obispo today. Ten. men were killed and fifty injured. It may be that others have beet killed, for debris is piled up in all directions. Bas Obispo cut Is about thirty miles from Colon, and the shock of the explosion was distinctly felt here, as in addition to that in the blast twenty-two tons of dynamite was exploded. All the killed were Spaniards except two, who were 'm ericans. Numerous reports are current a; :o the cause of the accident, but :he official version from Oulebra, which gives an estimate of ten tilled and fifty wounded, states that luring the loading of the last hole )f the blast the dynamite in this utting was discharged and the re naining twenty-two tones were ex )loded by concussion. The holes had not been connect d electrically as the discharge of he blast was set for 5 o'clock in he afternoon. The last hole was eing loaded under the supervision f one of the most efficient powder nen in the employe of the commis ion. Relief trains were sent to the c2ne of the disaster and one which eturned here several hours later rought back the report that 43 f the injured had been sent to ncon hospital. The officials on the rain stated that eleven dead had peen found, while many others in he gang of a hundred and twenty wo who were employed in the cut ere missing. It was also reported by the train 2en that the explosion was due to passing steam shovel, which hook d the wire leading to the immense harge of dynamite. Whether or not j his was the cause of the accident, a team shovel and crew which ha i ':ned to be on the scene were prac [cally buried under the mass of ocks and earth thrown up. Gangs were soon searching for be dead and assisting the wounded. :lectric lights were sent up, and to ight steain shovels were5 at work|] emoving the tons upon tone of de-| ris.
