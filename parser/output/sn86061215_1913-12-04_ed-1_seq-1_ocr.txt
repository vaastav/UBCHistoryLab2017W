The rural guards returned the fire of the rebels for twenty minutes after which the rebels are said to have fled to the hills. The casualties of both parties numbered ten dead and twenty or thirty wounded. Washington, D. C., Dec. 3.—The flight of Huer'a's generals in northern Mexico, federal evacuation of Chi huahua and Guaymas and the refusal of Mexican oil companies to furnish fuel for movement of federal troop trains were pointed out by officials here today as such events to which President Wilson referred in his mes sage to congress yesterday, when he declared the Huerta regime was crumbling "little by little every day." Diplomatically there have been no developments. President Wilson's statement that this government would not, in his opinion, be obliged to alter its policy of "watchful waiting" was regarded as forecasting a period of passive observation, with every eye of the government exercising at the same time a close scrutiny on the safe guarding of foreigners and their prop j&rt-yr Some diplomatists were inclined to Bee in President Wilson's expression of hopefulness that when Huerta had been forced from power, constitutional order would be restored "by the con cert and energy of such of Mexico's leaders as prefer the liberty of their people to their own ambitions," and answer to the frequent inquiries in the foreign press as to whether chaos and anarchy would result if Huerta re tired. In Temporary Capital. Mexico City, Dec. 3.—The seaport of Tampico was today officially declar ed the temporary capital of the state of Tamaulipas. General Antonio Ro bago, the miltary governor who was forced to abandon Ciudad Victoria and who was erroneously reported to have committed suicide has gone to Tam picc under orders from the federal government to reestablish his gover norship in the temporary capital. The war department today announc ed that General Arizmendi and other federal officers who fled from Ciudad Victoria to Cerritos. in the state of San Luis Potosi, had been ordered to reorganize their forces and march against Victoria. This task had first been entrusted to General Narrevete, who retreated to Monterey after his failure to relieve the hard pressed gar rison of Victoria. On account of the nature of the organization and equip ment as well as the long distances rnd broken topography of the country he federal government will find it difficult to handle its various military expedi tions without trains now that the rail roads have been practically deprived of fuel by the oil producing companies. On some of the divisions of the rail road system coal may be used and suf ficient supplies of that fuel are avail able to operate trains for some time but at the best it is possible all traffic except military trains will shortly be suspended. Reliable news as to the military op erations in various parts of the repub lic is meager in the federal capital and what little there is does not favor the government. Telegraphic- communication along the line of the national railroad has been reestablished but it is understood this has been done with the consent of the rebels. They are known to dom inate the line south Saltillo and to a point within seventy-five miles of San Luis Potosi. A consular report received here from Saltillo shows that residents of that city are still in ignorance of the mili tary operations in the surrounding country on account of the interrupted telegraphic communications.

Dec. 3—An out line of the message delivered by President Wilson to congress at Washington was prominent ly displayed by all the Spanish morning newspapers today. The only paper printed in English, however, buried it on an in side page. In commenting upon Ihe message the Independiente which is controlled by the gov ernment says: "The man at the white house has dared to affirm (against the truth universally conceded) that provisional President Huerta is losing sympathy ev ery day and that his fall is to be expected. It is hardly be lievable that President Wilson Wilson would have the temerity to assert such a thing. He thereby gives testimony of his bad faith toward things Mexi can."

A The Imparcial says: "From a good source, it is known that some of the foreign ministers accredited to Washington criti cize the message severely.
