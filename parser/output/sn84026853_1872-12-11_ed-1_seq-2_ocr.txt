Pursuant to notice, tlio stockhold ers of the Groenwood and Augusta Kailroad Company met at the Augus ta Club Room, for the purpose of effecting an organization. On motion of Gen. M. C. Butler, the meeting was organized by calling Hon. 1\, II. May to the Chair, and re * questing "W. IT.' "BurFCtl; Esq., to act as Secretary. A committee consisting o: Messrs. James A. Gray, M. C. Butler, and W K. Blake, was appointed to ascertain if a sufficient amour. I of stock ($150, 000) bad been subscribed and was epresented, to warrant organization under the conditions of the charter. Gen. P. II. Bradley staled, for in formation, that the amount ($150,000; hoon Hnhscribed. but was not rep resented in the meeting, because of the prevalence of the horse disease in the section of the country where subscribed. The committee roturned and rc orted, through Mr Gray, Chairman. ..iat 'the requisite amount of stock ad been subscribed, and that they onsidered it competent to proceed to organization of tho company. A Committee consisting of Messrs. A. M. Aiken, P. II. Bradley unci J. T. Parks, was appointed on proxies and reported 2,636 shares represented by prory, and 295 shares personally.

Al?o, as to the necessary expenses of the corps at tho present meeting, or to direct the suspension of its operations until a future meeting of the Board of Di rectors. ' J On motion of General Butler, Gen. Bradley was authorized to continuo the servieo of the surveying corps upon the samo terms as previously agreed nporv. On motion, the meeting adjourned. The Tax Levy. :r ? The most important matter bcturo the Legislature at present, is the bill 3fbr levying the taxes, and \xo see tka (~"nrr< mIt ton r>f" WilVS !\!1 il have agreed- to recommend tne ievying of a Stale tax of twelve mills, to-wit, fi ) miiU for general purposes, two mills for the school fund; and fivo mills for deficiontes" of the previous year. Add to thin/three mills the usual County Tax, and in Abbeville two mills additional for building the new Court House, and two mills more as recommended by the Grand Jury.^arul provided for by resolution ^-introduced by Senator H?ili?rshead, and we shall have to pay hero in this couuty a tax of near two per cent. It will be seen that no provision ha9 been mad<> for the payment ol the interest of the public debt, and this payment it seems is to await a proper adjustment and reduction of that debt. Cokesbcby Female College.? "Wo direct attention to the advertise ment of ?the Trustees of tins well known Institution containing the an nouncement that they have secured the services for the ensuing year of Mr. W. C. Benct, assisted by a com petent corps of instructors. Mr. B. is a graduate of tho University of Edidboro', a scholar of fine talents and attainments, and has proved him self a very successful teacher. Un der his superintendence we feel sure that the College will emulate its past reputation, and extend again far and wide the sphere of its influence. We commend it to the favor and pa tronage of our friends, and especially to those of the Masonic fraternity. "Weekly religious services will ho held in Trinity Church on Wed t?c6d' sat 11:30 a. m., instead of 4 f.rr Nomination of Jadge Orr as Minister to Rnssia. Judgo Orr has been nominated to one of the highest offices in the gift of the President, that of Minister to Russia, and a correspondent to the Tribune states that it was made with* out solicitation on his part. It is a due recognition of the claims of one of the "leading Republicans of the ! South and a zealoub advocate of lie construction, as well as a fitting trib ute to the ability and cxperieucc of a vetcron statesman. Though enly in the prime of life Judge Orr has bad a varied political career, and brings- to his new position an en larged converse with men and things. Unco speaker ot tue uousc 01 jtep rcscntatives, Senator in the Confed erate Congress, Governor of the State, and Circuit Judge, few men can 1 oast a riper experience, greater sagacity, or more practical ability. As the New York Herald says of bim ol* "ripened political experience at home, a conservative in the dc3t sense .if tho s?frt m?n. eonl in dt. liberation, bat firm in action," ho will bo a safe and acccptable n^an at St Pe'ersburg. "We feel assured that neither the President nor tho country will liavo reason to regret tho ap pointment. ? A Parting Word with the Intelligencor. We cannot forbear a parting word 'with our friend of tho Intelliyrnrer. though there bo nothing of new mat icr ui riis unci repiy it- cuu mi ni ? rejoinder. Its tone will scarcely jus tify tho commendation which ?ve be stowed on tho courtesy and good tem per of the first artHo, and our friend for once, serins to have forgotton that dogmatism is not argument, and that epithets weaken rather than add force to reasoning. The pith of tho controversy be tween us, and indeed all that could justify a discussion at all, was the ? ? 4 I > *-. k a /i#> m r\ n * ? i rn mn?*itQ r\f ijuuauvsii v/i tuv v uivi w vi | the Abbeville and Anderson markets, and hcneo wo cannot see how an , abandonment of tho main issue can ' bo inferred from our disclaimer of any imputation upon tho honesty of the Anderson merchant. If there be any "throwing up of the sponge," \ there is none certainly on the only ] material point of tho controversy. i But the Iutrlligenctr thinks our ex- | planation of the delay in noticing | "Lon<; Cane's" communication is , ? j "lame and impotent." Others may think differently, and we will not i bandy epithets with cur friend. Our j statement speaks for itself, and wc do i not know that wc can now add Any- i * ? * ? \\T,\ nnnnAf on t* I tU.IIJJ LU il?> lUiWCi ll.g liiilliIWi?HI'J j what our friend of the Intelligencer "contemplated," but wo Know that he gave currcncy to an article which i charged that it was a "shame and scandal" that Abbeville farmers were forced to seek a market else where, and vouchcd too for the truth of the facts upon which the charge was predicated. , And here let ns correct a misappre- , hension of the Intelligencer, which is so patent, that if is singular that it | should have occurred. We did not j snpposo for a moment, as he alleges, | that ho meant to reflect npen the Ab- , bcville planter for seeking the Ander- j son market. It is the part of true , wisdom to sell in tho highest market, , and buy in the lowest, and if Ander son can make goou its claims in these j particulars, "the shame and scandal" [lies at the door of the Abbeville mer ; cnant alone. And this is what "Long j Cane " meant to charge. ! As to the rnaiu issue, we have no {new facts to present, and rather thanj i^capitulate a "twiee told tale," beg; I leave to dismiss the subject. | Attempt at Murder and TJou |beuv.?Wo are indebted to our friend^ Mr. W. C. Benet. lor the following particulars of a dastardly attvn.pt i?t murder and robbery upon a wcll j known citizen of the vicinity of that inlat e. Mr. VV. A. Moore. Leav'nir his . " i i sto.-c in Cokesbury about sunset as is! ! bis habit, on his return to his homo, which is two miles distunt, in com-' pany with a colored man, Sam Jami son, ho was s*'t upon by somo bus picious characters when near home. Four shots were successfully fired at him, but he escaped by putting spurs to his horse?one buckshot passing through his hat. The purpose was clearly to murder and rob. Mr. Moore offers a reward of $100 for in formation sufficient to convict. Mr. B. furnishes also the particn lars'of another supposed attempt at robbery which occurred with Mr. Wade llobertson a few days after, whilst riding homo in a w.ngon, his little Bon, riding some distance be hind him on horseback. Several men sprang into the road, aod would Lave seized the boy's horse by the bridle, but that he took refugo in flight. Mr. K had sold a load of cotton at jCokesbury that evening, and the rogues no doubt supposed that ho wa3 riding the horse?a c lay bank well known in that vicinity. The President's Message is a conservative document, temperato in tone, and catholic in spirit, and seems to guarantee amnesty for the past, and new hope for the future. I ^ | Removal. ?
