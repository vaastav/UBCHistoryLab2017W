Fifth avenne is not much given to display, even when a million­ aire is carried to his tomb, and when the hour for the funeral ol Will­ iam H. Vanderbilt arrived Friday morning the 10th, there were but few indications, even in the neighborhood of the Vanderbilt home that anything unusual was goiDg on. Just three flags fluttered at half mast among a plenty of bare poles. No badge of crape was seen anywhere except on the little electric bell at the Vanderbilt mansion. The ceremonies in the church were simple Episcopal burial services. They were con­ ducted by Rev. Dr. Cooke, the pas­ tor, and Mr. Oapo.

To seotliestal wart, rugged forms of eight half-breeds with beards covered with frost struggling under their load was a sight never to be forgotten. Two paces in front of the coffin walked Riel's two brothers, Joseph and Alexandre, both stalwart specimens of their race. The first sleigh in the procession contained Riel's mother, his two sisters and his wife. The poor old woman on leaving the house in­ sisted on walking in the procession, and did so as long aa lierfaiKngetrength would bear her up. She was at last obliged to fide in a sleigh. The ordinary rcquim mass was celebrated by the clergy at the cathedral. The poor mother was weeping piteously, as were also other members of the family and relatives, a large number of whom were present. The Des Moines Valley Lands.

By this act the state was stop­ ped from all claims to the grant in the Des Moines valley. Settlers went on these granted lands supposing they were part 61 the public domain, the state treated them as trespassers, and sued them. What a Fall Was There. Chicago, Special.—Hon.
