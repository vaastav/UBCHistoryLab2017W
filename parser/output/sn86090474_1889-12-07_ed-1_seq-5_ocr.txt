Thousands of people testify to the success of Hood s Sar WASHINGTON.1 Washington, Dec. 2, 168fl.-Mr. Harrison's message was read in-both Houses of Congress to day. It is too early to Bay what is thought of it as a few members pay close enough at tenion to the reading of a message in the House or Senate to care to ex press an opinion upon it; they prefer saparilla as a remedy for catarrh when other to read it over carefully afterwards preparations had failed.

The catarrh was very disagreeable, espec ially in the winter, causing constant dis charge from niy nose, ringing noises in my tars, and vains in the back of my head. The effort to clear my head by hawking and Catarrh spitting was painful. Hood's Sarsaparilla cave me relief immediately, while in time I was entirely cured.

Clark, the clerk of the last House, called the new House to order at noon to-day, and he is probably the last democrat who will have the honor of presiding, even, tempo rarily, over the House until the first Monday in December, 18'.'1, when a democrtic Speaker is again expected to be elected. Seenator Quay, aided by the silent support of the administration, suc ceeded in making Reed Speaker of the House, just as your correspondent from the beginning predicted, but it may in the future prove to be a dear ly bought victory for Mr. Quay.as he has made some enemies that will not hesitate to get even if the chance ever presents itself, and it generaly does in political as well as private life One enfmy that Mr Quay has made he may well beware of. It is J. M Carson, Washington correspondent of the Philadelphia Ledger, who had the aucidity to become a candidate for Clerk of the House without con suiting Mr. Quay. Mr. Carson claims that a majority of the Pennnsylvania delegation had pledged him their support, which virtualy meant his election, as the place was conceded to McMINNYILLE PRODUCE MARKET.

McPherson got the nomination, but Mr. Quay got the enmity of Mr. Carson, who the newspaper men, who resent Mr. Quay's saying that Mr. Carson only represented a lot of irresponsible newspaper men. No politicians has ever antagonized the Washington newspaper men without paying ery dearly for . it. Ex-speaker Keifer will bear me out in this assertion as also would the late Schuyler Coffax if he was alive. Keep yonr eye on Quay. Mr. Reed has teen made Speaker because it is believed by the republi can leaders that lie can be relied upon to get the best of the minority in their efforts to maintain their rights in the House. He is not expected to do this by his superior knowledge of pari ia men tary tactics, but by arbi trary dacisions. There will be ex ceedingly lively times in the House when he attempts to deprive the democrats of any of their rights The newspaper correspondents are heartily glad that the speakershi larce is ended, ihey were required by their papers to telegraph daily ac counts of the fight, when there was no fight. There has been 110 time within the last three months whe the fact was not perfectly plain to an impartial observer that Reed woul be speaker. There were two reasons for the exaggerated newspaper ac counts of the alleged contest. One was opposition to Reed and the hope that a real contest might be brought about by the sham publications, and the other was the desire on the part of the correspondents to earn their salaries. The democratic caucus to nominate House officers was called for last Fri day night, but owing to the absence of a quorum was postponed until this morning at 10 o'clock when Mr. Car lisle received the nomination for Speaker and all of the old House offi cials were renominated. Xo other business was trausacted by thecaucus. The question of who shall be chair man of the ways and means commit tee of the House is going to make hard feelings on the part of some of the repuqlicans. Mr. W. ). Kelley of Pennsylvania, thinks he is entitled to it, but it is almost certain that Speaker Reed will give it to McKin ley of Ohio. The usual hustlng and bustling crowd of men and women attended the opening of Congress to-day. It Ls an annual show that hundreds of Washington people attend regularly. I saw faces in the galleries to-day that I have seen there on the first Monday in December for twelve years past. Attending the opening of Congress and shaking hands with every President is a positive mania with lots of folks here. The new House officials are, Jed j f Maine Speaker; McPherson of As we have said, the most import ant part of the President's message, the one which overshadows all others in importance, is the recommenda tion of legislation to place congress ional elections under Federal control. All of our readers may not under stand the full significance of this scheme, which is the furthest step in the direction of centralism ever suggested. President Harrison's plan may be regarded as substantially embodied in the bills which have already been introduced in the United States Senate by Senators Sherman and Chandler. Mr. Chand- er recognizes the force of the opposi tion to the proposition in the North, and therefore in terms limits the application of his bill to the States of South Carolina, Mississippi and Louisiana. Senator Sherman's bill is general in its application, but, of course, is intended merely as an in strument of tyranny and oppression in the South. Otherwise the principal features of the two measures are the same. If the scheme pro- iKwed should become law President Harrison will be empowered to ap point a Roard of State Canvassers consisting of five members for each State and an Electoral Board for each Congressional District, consisting of three members. They are to hold office for life. The Electoral Roard must appoint a registrar and three judges for each precinct and are empowered to increase the number of voti ng precincts (id libitum. These are to hold their office for six years, subject to removal at any timeif they fail to discharge their duties to the satisfaction of well, we may say, the Kepuoiican party. Their duties are to register the votes, count the bal lots, "correct irregularities" (:) atu "declare the result." The mere statement of the terms of the bill presents upon the face of it all that can be said in condemnation of the scheme. It would create vast and powerful machine absolute ly under the control of the President of the United States, whose appoints would have almost absolute power in congressional elections. There would be an army of more than halfa mil lion officeholders absolutely under his control. Every precinct would hav its "returning board" empowered t overturn the expressed will of the people in obedience to the will of the President of the United Stales. Wit such a tremendous machine in tli control of the President he wotilc have the elections absolutely in hi own hands. Congress would he simply his creature, and the means for perpetuating his own powe would be as great as any despot could desire. Once let such a law become a fixture upon our statute books, and we may bid farewell to popular elec tions and popular liberty. It would be centralization 111 its worst, its most despotic form, for it would virtually give to one man the power to veto the popular will. We know whatsuchalaw would mean for the South, and especially for the further Southern States. The burglars and chicken thieves, from wh se ranks the Federal appointees for those States have been largely chosen by the present Administration, would doubtless furnish acceptable workmen for the operation of this huge ma chl ne. Elections would be a farce a mere form for legistering the will of the dominant party or the supreme dictator at Washington. If any political party in Great Britain were to champion such a law it would bo crushed beneath an ava lanche of popular indignation. It would require bayonets and cannon to force such a law upon the English Ieople. Xo English monarch would imperil his throne by asking for such power. Yet here in the most enlight ened republic upon eartii we find a great political party and its chosen head gravely considering or actively urging a scheme having all the essential features of despotism in its manifest tendency and containing the most tremendous potentialities for the utter destruction of popular liberty. President Harrison has declared war against not only the South, but against the genius of American institutions and the per petuity of the American Republic. Dibrell, Tenn., Dec. 3, 188!).
