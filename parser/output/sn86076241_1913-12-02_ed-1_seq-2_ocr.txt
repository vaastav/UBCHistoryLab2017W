TUESDAY EVENING, DECEMBER 2, 1913 MORE OF HEARST The Sau Francisco Examiner's alarmist, its financial corres pondent in New York, has another pessimistic article in that pa per of Sunday, in vhich he says nearly all depends on President Wilson's forthcoming message to congress. If, as the correspondent intimates, the manage contains further threats to attack the trusts of the country, to probe into the affairs of the combinations that are l-.aintaimng the high cost of foodstuffs, and it is the purpose of the administration to unloosen the hands that have been trying to throttle the nation for the past sixteen or seven teen ye'irsj hell is going to pop, and Mr. Correspondent wrings out tears of grief for the poor workingmen who by the million will be walking the streets in the next few weeks. I low absurd his premises are is hardly necessary to state. People who keep up with the times know that it is rot, pure and simple, but the fact remains that the Hearst papers have a follow ing and some readers of the Examiner and American pin their faith to the articles that appiar therein, and it is they, as much as the papers, that spread the seed of discontent that Hearst is endeavoring to sow. As a relief from the Hearst articles, it is a pleasure to turn to the last number of The Literary Digest, which, treating the sub ject of trade, tariff and the administration, publishes the opin ions of a number of journals and the views of many experts. They refute in every particular the statements of the Hearst sheets, and are so convincing that a number of them are given . The first, which follows, is the expression of the Literary Digest. It reads: "With many of the main currents of business running below flood level and showing signs of continued recess ion, one might expect a chorus of voices arraigning the new tariff as the culprit. Yet a canvass of the leading trade and industrial organs by The Literary Digest reveals a surprising absence of any accusing chorus. Instead, we find not only a prevailing note of optimism as to the future, but a tendency to look elsewhere thaii to the tariff schedules for an explanation of any slackening of business activities. Thus it is pointed out that the hesitation which causes concern in this country is evident also in Germany. Canada, India, and Brazil, and is accounted for by the experts as the result of. an overstrained condition of the-world's money merkets." "Commercial failures in the United States during October of this year, it is true, were more numerous than in October of any other year since 1895, but no less an authority than the editor of Dun's Review (New York) confesses himself unable to discover any connection between the increase in failures and the tariff. Even the depression in so basic an industry as the manufacture of iron and steel seems to be causing little immediate worry ti students of our economic conditions, who point out that the trade is still a long way from the state of prostration that afflicted it three years ago, and find a reason for its present slowing up in the poverty of the railroads. Reports of increased rather than diminished activity in the textile trades are explained by some observers on the theory that they. are reacting from a long period of dullness and abstention from buying while the revision of the tariff was in progress." . "Various manufacturers of cotton goods in this section of New England, when asked for an explanation of the apparent fact that the tariff reduction had not caused great falling off in domestic business, and not been followed by the predicted great increase of imports, declared that it is too early to judge the re sults which may come." New York Evening Post. "Manufacturers of desirable silks," says The Dry Goods Economist (New York), ".have orders that will keep much of their machinery busy well into next year." The same trade organ assures us that the great majority of those engaged in the dry goods business are optimistic under the new tariff because they realize that "the changes in merchandise values will be brought about gradually" and that "today the influence of supply and de mand is paramount to that exerted by' a lowering of our scale of customs duties." Turning to the general business situation, we find certain facts to balance against the reported slowing of activity in the Middle West, the recession of the steel trade, and the railroads' plea of poverty. Conspicuous among these is the report of the controller of-the currency showing the condition of the 7,509 na tional banks. ' Commenting on this report, a Washington corres pondent of the New York Sun says: "If the bankers, country and city, of the United States are deeply perturbed over coming changes in the American financial system, visual demonstration of their reported nervousness is not reflected in the loan account. The comparison of totals shows that the loans on November 26, 1912. were $201,895,824 less than on October 21st this year. The loan, account shows also an in crease over the statement rendered on August 9, 1913, of '$92, 322,328. .' 'The banks of New York City report decreases since August 9th in loans of $26,272,715 and in cash of $29,059,727, but there is an increase in deposits of $79,102,171. Compared with a year ago. loans, however, have increased $36,019,010." -oo- 

GOOD PRESS AGENT WORK When "September Morn" was painted it did not make any special stir in the art world. The artist represented a young girl with her feet in a'creek and nude. 'She was shivering with the cold and hesitating about going in any deeper. In spite of the girl's nudity there was nothing loud or shocking in the painting and the subject had been delicately handled. Hut the artist was a shrewd fellow and hit on the idea of getting some good advertising out of the picture and got a re ligious weekly to severely criticise.it. This was the starter. The clergy following the lead of the 'pious newspaper took up the cry which made the picture about as. popular as any picture of reccent years. It has been reproduced a -million times in va rious styles and the artist has reaped a, fortune. Now comes a London preacher and has selected the famous 1 masterpiece of De Vincini as the object of his wrath. Why this particular picture has been ranked as a master piece few people can ever figure out. It is merely a portrait of a woman and not a specially beautiful one in an ordinary pose. Hut the London preacher has suddenly discovered something especially bad about it and pronounces the picture the "embodi ment of all the evil that the artist could think of." About all the reply a man can think of in this connection is "nits!" It looks as if some big firm was about to flood the mar ket with, a chromo reproduction of this'work and was doing some cheap but effective advertising. oo The fiat money that the revolutionists print in Mexico don't seem to be held in much esteem. The shop keepers refuse to take it on any basis. The soldiers, when the money is refused, proceed to demolish the store and appropriate the contents.

It is made with the same grand stand features that characterize the war against the local lotteries.
