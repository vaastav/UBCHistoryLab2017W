In fiict we do not believe Andrew Johnson wrote it. It bears' the- earmarks of lenry Stanbery, the Attorney General. The people, and their representatives in Congress, care very little what Apr drew Johnson may say or do. lie ha s betrayed th e people who elected him, and he is now powerless. ' Congress will pay very little attention to him. 

CO:GKEM. - Congress met ou Monday of last week, and at once proceeded to business. In the House the section permitting the pardon rebels in advance of conviction was repealed. The matter came up in' the Senate and was debated at length. he bill permitting negroes to vote in the District of Columbia will come up this week. 1 The murders of Union sol diers in South Carolina, and the New Orleans murders, will be investigated. The question of taking the appointing power from the President and vesting it in the Chief Justice has been agitated. Congress sets out vigorously, and ill no doubt provide for the meeting of the next Congress immediately upon the adjournment of the present Congress, iu March. 

RANDOM THOUGHTS Ho. SO. BT TUB EDITOR. I wcut to Portsmouth tout week and staid couple of days. Going down Second Street, met S. P. Drake, of the Republican, and Rev. J. Q. Gibson, formerly editor of the Stumlard, and more recently Lieut., aud then Chaplain of the Second O. H. Artillery, then Agent of the Frcedinan's Commission, and now preacher in charge at Hanging Rock and Haverhill. My wife and I topped with Mr, Glbsou and family during our stay in the city. After dinner Mr. Gibson and I went to look at the now H. E. Church on Sixth Street. It Is a line brick building, and the slate roof was being put on. Its original cost was estimated at y.xiw, . .t . . a jt.m rtt A but it will cost much more. Here is a building going up at the cost of only one of the many con. gregatious in the city, and It will cost more man the new Court House In this place, which Is bum ai the expeuso of the whole county and which some of the ueoule think will ruin tlicm. While we were looking at the new church, Rev. Mr. Crook, Psstor of Blglow Chapel, aud Rev. Mr. Bee, Presiding Elder of the District came along, Mr. Crook invited us to go and sec bis church, He could not get the key, bntliy going through the underground passage, we entered the lecture room, and then the main room. It Is a very flne, well arranged building. I attended prayer meet ing at this church at night, and found there the poor mechanic aud laborer, aud also the rum bauker and merchant. It was pleasant to see so flue a building, provided by the means furnished by the wealthy, aud equally eidoyed by the poor. I sow oue lino Presbyterian church, two Epis copalian, one Methodist Protestant, besides oth ers. The public schools of Portsmouth are taught In two large Union school houses, ono on Second Street, and one further back. They appeared to be well attended. .' I visited the principal business houses In the City. Wherever they advertised I found that they were prospering. Mr. J. F. Towelt, on Front Street, la one of the most extensive advertlsors In the place. His card may be aeon In nearly all the country papers In this part of tho State. He told me that his trade' was extensive and was more permanent and reliable than be had anticipated. He showed mo his slock of goods. It Is very large and well selected. He deserves his great success, as he is oue of the most honorable busi ness men In the State. He made me a preseut of a pair of warm, lined kid gloves. Stephenson, the bookseller, is doing well, but he Is In poor health. I booght some paper from him. Ho Is an honorable dealer. Oeorge A. Waller, the hord. ware merchant, also on Front Street, Is doing well. Waller Is a clever man, and an honorable dealer. Mr. Taylor, of the Taj lor House, Is doing a line business. He ha renovated the old "Biggs House," killed off the army of bed bugs, and has made It a llrst class hotel. It deserves, and Is re- eelvlng, a large patronage. I saw the StamUud being eagerly read by the guests, while waiting for dinner. Mr. Taylor evinces his good sense, by furnishing bis guests with the Standard. Daroarln & Co., wholesale grocers, aro doing a steady, lariro business. Itecd, Curtis A Co., druggists, on Second Street, are doing well. T, J. Purscll i, Co,, dealers In ipiecnswarc, glass. ware &c., on Front Street, aro doing well. They will renew their advertisement In the Standard. I called on Mr. Yoakley, Piano dealer, but he was uot In. I must not omit to mention my old friend A. W. Busklrk. wholesale grocer. Ho docs not advertise now, but ho I doing a fair business, havlnir heen In business for many years. I bail a pleasant honrs talk with blm. I met Judge Peck at the drug aturoof Reed, Curtis A Co. I had not seen the Judge for some vcsis, He was pretty severe on me when I com. menced the practice of the law, and I did uoUllke him very well: but he Is so good a lawyer, and he had perhaps forgotten the time when he was com montlng, that I forgive him. The Judgo Is be ginning Ui look old. I met Elljth (Hover on the street. Nearly every liody calls lilm Ell. That Is not his name. I asknd him If he rememliered when I subscribed for his papor, the "Scioto Cr. itr." In the year 1SS6. The next yoar he sold out to Hamilton ft Clark. Edward Hamilton edited Urn naner for some years, and then went to Ore. goo. I do not know what became of Sllinan Clark. Bllnn and Hutchlns afterwards conducted the paper for S lime. 8ieaklng of the paper, I may mention that I called In the several offices. The Time$ was neat and In good order, as usual. Dan. McFarland was at his post, in the TrUiuoe odlce. Mr. Wetmore waa In the fcpubhea oftlee. Mr. Drake waa not In. I called on Col. Turley, Assessor, and had a pleasant talk with hhu. I saw Mr. Sebastian Klfort, who resided here soma ten Jeara ago. He I vet in KentucKj The rebels killed bis son, Henry, during the re bellion. What any decent, Union man can thing to reside Id such a place as Kentucky, I cannot Iruaulne. During this short stay In Portsmouth, I saw lit tle of misery or poverty. That there are poor and suffering person In the place, there can be no doubt. For Instance, Iaawa little girl, perhap ten years of age, ragged and bare-foot, going alonir th navement eating raw turnip. But such sight are not eomuiou. There is much wealth and refinement in th place, and I was pleased to ace the principal business men attend- Ing thoehurchos, and throwing their Influence In
