Burke who said In substance: "I Congratulate Company A upon its achievement of this fine armory. I am glad so many armories are be­ ing built over the state as it indicates a good healthy status of military spiirt. Military training is good, healthy traning as it not only devel­ ops the physique but teaches disci­ pline and the mastery of one's self. Military organizations will prove a benefit to the state and the cities having such armories as this. The state not only derives benefits from the better training of her young men, but these men are trained in a way which will become the defense of the country in time of need and preserve our indpendence, our property and homes. I am not looking for or ex pectlng war, but the best time to pre­ pare for war is to do it in the time of peace and these citizen soldiery are now the second line of our national defense and would become part of any army we should need in case of war. I congratulate both Company A and the city of Bismarck on having such a fine building." The Moneta Five then rendered a beautiful solo and quintette which was heartily encored. Adjutant General Poole was the next speaker, his address being, the longest on the program and in it he reviewed the history of the guard and paid a glowing tribute to all the com (Continued on page •^r^^wsr- •». tor i-jj 4.) of peace could be of gerater worth than the work which has brought you together. You have come here to make this nation's future as great and happy as its present. It is the largest national task of today, and thank you for making ready to un­ dertake it. If you do no more than fix the national attention upon the problem, you will do vast good. It augurs well for our future that you are here and it is to the credit of our country that in this matter it should take the lead among the na­ tions of the world.
