There is much important work to be done, but it is quite likely that the Republicans will allow tho session to go by without accomplishing anything We have received tho official proceedings of the Commercial Convcn tion held at Louisville on the 11th and 12th of May last. It is very comprehensively compiled. giving tho addresses of prominent delegates, and is a fine addition to the valuable lit erature of the State. We acknowledge with pleasure an invitation to attend the reception and celebration in honor of the return of Kentucky's troops, to be held in Louisville the 12th, 13th and 14th tost. Much preparation has been made and it is expectid to be an event befitting in every way the demands of th o occasion. Mr. J. H. Thomas, one of tho various editors of the Jiepublican, in a public note to The Herald, says: No, brother, when I want to herald myself to the world as an ungrateful Idiot or a contemptible ass, I will send j ou an article signed and sealed. Of course; to be sure. How else would you expect us to know who wrote it? We have just yanked the forms from the press to chronicle the fact that W6 read in the Louisville papers that there is a company of soldiers known aB the Louisville Legion, and that the full membership will arrive home about the 'steenth of this month on a visit. Other Kentucky papers please copy. mm It is said that the German card game "skat" is becoming very popular throughout the country. There is a little game played by the Republican politicians of Kentucky, called "scat," which is also becoming quite conventional. Ab usual, it takes two sides to play it those who hold office and those who don't. The Herald, having stirred up the animals in the Republican menagerie and gotten them to growling and spitting at each other from dark corners, feels that it is best to drop the proddingstick and flee to its own den, to escape waving cars, and worst of all the fearful efforts of a Bobby Burns poet. u The President's message to Congre&s is a rather hollow and insipid affair, and hardly cornea up to the expecta tion of the moment. The most of it is a narrative of events of the war and a recapitulation of affairs of the times with which everybody is familiar. It is a voluminous document, dealing in generality, and tho real advice could have been given in much less space. o Dewey's victory at Manila was a magnificent affair, but his plan of action afterwards will give the United States no end of trouble. If, after annihilating the Spanish fleet, he had moved away from the Philippines or avoided any attempt at usurpation, much national complication would have been avoided. The fact that ho stayed thero and that something had to be done to uphold his plan of action, has been tho cause of all this territorial expansion talk, and has placed us in an attitude tho troubles of which have just begun. Every few days wo run across tome cure-all newspaper recipe, guaranteed to never fail, &c., but tho moat barbarous and nonsensical of these pieces of advice has lately como to our notice. It claims to be a cure for box cholera and says you must shut tho swino up in a pen and not let them defamatory half-sheet issued at Beav-have a drop of water or a biro to eat.er Dam essays to "call us down," as until they are cured. It eetn no limit as to time, but it perhaps means that the hog must be kept until "i dies of hunger and thirst. In that ovent, tho hog would certainly never be bothered with cholera again. It is assured by those who profess to know that were the vote taken now, as regards the Philippine question, that the treaty would not be ratified by the proper majority in the Senate. It is hoped that the question will stand this way, at least for the time being, and that ultimately tho treaty will be defeated. The welfare of our great country aud proper re sped for our Constitution demand it. Tho people of tho United States have u right to be heard in this matter. end tho great majority of them are not in favor of this territorial expan - Bion policy this colonial idea in re J gard to the Philippines, j Those rabid nntiGoebclbill Re publicans who can ece no fairness i whatever in our now election law and wjJQ fieem (Q rCgftrii ni who havo any thing to do with its operation as rank 'political thievea and robbers, will periap8 pauao long enough in their .denunciation to nolo that the State Election Board at Frankfort decided i UMe" B,veu "u "H uu uuimuu whatever of a favorable nature. The new peace treaty cannot become valid until it is ratified by a two-thirds majority of the U. S. Sen ate. And the financial clause cannot become operative until an appropriation of the stipulated amount of money is made by a bill originating in the Lower House of Congress. There is indication of considerable opposition in the Senate to the proposed treaty. In case the Senate rejects the treaty, tho protocol would come up again for consideration by the two countries, and a new treaty would have to be negotiated. The rejection of the treaty would not compel the two countries to revert to a condition of war. It would simply compel a new bargain. Considerable gush has been in dulged in lately by the newspapers because Lieut. Hobson, of Merrimac fame, is said to have refused fifty thousand dollars for a series of on the Santiago affair, giving as his reason that his connection with the navy was all that made his services valuable, and that ho does not feel that he has a right to make merchandise of his position with his country. Of course thissounds very nice, and unselfish and all that, but it is said to be a fact that Hobson recent ly accepted six thousand dollars for a seriesof magazine articles with his President to investigate the misman signature, and we see no reason why agementof the war is still killing time be should not take in tho fifty thousand drawing pay, but accomplishing and also while he's nt it.

We will now begin to conquer our new citizens and endeavor to get them properly subjected. For this purpose the President recommends an increase of the standing array to 100,000. Our thirty-years' dream of peace has been rudely interrupted, and we now start out upon an internecine warfare of interminable length. A scene of end less conflict and perplexity confronts us, in tho presence of which the best heads of our nation stand dazed. Our greatest statesmen are now unable to outline an intelligible and practicable policy. Such are the rewards of im perialism. - Our friend Mattingly, who runs the Water Mill that part of it which the water don't run is a little out of practice since tho cold weather set in, but ho is not yet quite speechless. He says he was gazing out on the muddy waters of Rough river a few days ago, as said waters were pouring over the dam at his mill, when he saw two large mud turtles come floating down stream. He (Mattmgly) says that upon the back of each turtle was a nico fat partridge neatly dressed. He (Mattingly) further says that up on closer inspection he noticed that each quail was incased between two slicesof baker's bread, uicely browned, and apparently hot. How all this happened to occur, Mr. Mattingly does not undertake to explain. He merely related the incident to offtet a pastoral which Ab. Yeuer had just got off in the barber fahop. Mr. Mat-tingly says the turtles went on down stream. Tin; Herald has been strictly in it for the past fow weeks. It has been the object of abuse from several quarters. The Fox alley mudslinger has been very busy, giving himself considerable exercise without any cause whatever. The editor of the we expected, for writing an article in defence of Hartford. Mr. Thomas, one of tho Republican9 motley corps of editors, (at least he told us he was) also takes his pen and stool in hand, Ac. Even the great (?) editor of Printer's Ink deigns to notice us in a earcastic editorial, and later writes us a private letter in which he feels compelled to inform us that we are "an unmitigated donkey." But wo don't mind It much. It don't hurt us and it seems to do the boys a power of good. It don t evince a very kindly spirit, but it proves one thing beyond a doubt that somebody has been reading Tin: Herald. Don Emilio AauiNALDO,tho Pres ident of tho Philippine Republic, is just now a personage of no little in 'terest. Personally be is a boyish looking fellow of small stature, witb a wellBhaped head and fuzzy little mustache. He will bo thirty years old tho zzd day oi next March. As aetatesmnu ho b no slouch, and ho to uocnuiao wuw iUVcuai iw. is, moreover, & very troublesome rebel. He has a large following of loyal subjects and tho evidenced ability to oversee and command them. His attitudo towards tho United States is just now rather inexplicable. He claims to regard us in the friendliest manner,but he shows no inclination to renounce his ideas of a free republic and become an humble private citizen of tho United States. He is at present an anomaly in authority a man of great power and of no power at all. There isevery evidence that Aguinaldo will give us great trouble yet. There is every indication that the United States will havo to whip the Filipinos into subjection before they will ever consent to government by this country. And this would be so much a violation of our Constitution as to be preposterous. The Filipino press declares that tho natives will not submit to the disposition made of them by the Paris peace treaty, and says Spain cannot cede tho Philippines, as they were never hers. The Filipinos decline to permit their homes to bo bought and sold like merchandise. The natives declare they are ready to fight in defense of their rights, and assert that their government and people are unanimous in claiming nothing less than independence. They aver that they have incontestible claims upon the moBt valuable of the islands by right of conquest, and they refuse to be dis lodged. It is plain that Uncle Sam adopted a very troublesome and rebellious child when ho took in the Philippine archipelago. McKinley's troubles in this direction have just begun. THE WAR 

COMMISSION'S WORK. The commission appointed by the favorable answer are propounded. If unfavorable to the wars manage ment, he is immediately silenced. In spite of these tactics, however, considerable evidence is being brought out that shows tho woful mismanagement of the war in many directions. The commission took evidence in New York last week, and although great pains have been taken to keep the newspapers from finding out just what is said by the witnesses, yet a full report of the proceedings is generally obtained. Speaking of stoners and their work, Harper's Weekly, one of the foremost Republican papers of the country, says: Instead of try lag to discover the truth, they cross examine witnwsesjn the in terests of the particular branch of the aer vice attacked. They are especially fond of annoying women witnesses who are evidently telling the truth about the horrors they saw at Montauk. They are de-scribed in the newspapers as "Ironical" and "sarcastic" and "Inilnuating," Why were these gentlemen appointed? Was It for the purpose of defending the admin. Istratiou, or for the purpose of ascertain log the truth? Notwithstanding their ef forts to conceal the truth, however, facts are coming to light that bear out the newspaper repoits of the horrible condition of affairs at Santiago and at Montauk, Geueral Breckinridge, General Greene, General Singer, and other witnesses among them good women who worked at Montauk tiavetestified to facts that seriously reflect upon army administration, and, among other things, make It apparent that the Santiago campaign was badly managed from the beginning. It Is clear now that General Shatter should not have commanded cveu a division or a brigade In that campaign, and that much of the suffering was due to his Indifference and general Incompetency. It Is clear that the administration broke up the staff corps, taking away from them their experienced officers; that the quartermaster's department was Incompetent; that the medical department was Insufficient; and that every atari corps, from highest to lowest, was a failure. Some of the reports of the heada of departments are confirming all that baa been said about the mismanagement of affairs. He Got the Hot End. fXutertorJournal,1 Editor Matthews, of Tun Hartford Herald, is making a strong fight against Geo. P. Row ell A Go., the skinflint New York advertising agents, because- In their publication known as Printer's Ink, they decried tho valno of country weekly newspapers as an advertising medium. Tho firm is trying to have Congress refund 325,000 or $30,. 000 postage that Is paid on the publication, a and Mr. Matthews has secured tho promiso of his Congressman, Hen D. H. Smith, to do everything in his power to turn Row oil's little bill down. In pledging himself. Mr. Smith takes occasion to pay tho country press tho ! compliment of saying it Is practically tbo only independent press in tbo country.

Tho Commonwealth's Attorney finished his argument to tho jury In tho Robert Brown murder case at 12:45 o'clock this after noon, and tho jury retired to thoir room. Thoir deliberation l&bted but thirty minntcs, and when thoy returned into court at 1:15 oVlock.a vordiot of guilty was announced, nod Brown's punishment fixed at death. Tho jurymen's minds wero mado up, and thoy were all of tho simo opinion whon they loft the jury box. and bnt ono ballot was taken after they got to their room. Tho verdict, when road by J. U. Cornelius, tbo foreman of tho jury, was greeted by the spectators with applause, which was quickly suppressed by the court. Brown, who had waited nervously the return of the jury, became Tory pale when ho heard tho verdict. lie half arose from his seat, and, addressing tbo oonrt, asked in a peifectly firm voice, however, if he might fay a few words. Before the court could answer him, ono of his attorneys went to him and persuaded him to keep quiet. The ooutt ordorcd tho jailer to return Brown to jiil, and as he was led away, hand-cuffed to an officer and surrounded by a heavy gnard, tho crowd left the court room and followed him. WOULD HAVE BEEK LTNCIIED. It is understood that there was an organization of men ready, if tho jury disagreed (or returned a verdict fixing any other punishment than the death penalty,to take Brown from tbocnstody of the officers beforo ho could be taken baok to the jail and mete ont to him the death penalty. The court room was packed with men, two-thirds of whom, perhaps, would havo assisted in the banging, while oat-side wero many others waiting quietly to bear the jnry's verdict. Thephn was kept very quiet, but that there wad a plan, with determined men to carry it ont, there is little doubt. Brown's attorneys will make a motion for a new trial, and if their motion is overruled, will take the caBo to tho Court of Appeals. drowx's cniMK. The crime for which Brown was today given the extreme penalty of the law was committed about fonr weeks ago, when be attempted to kill several members of his wife's family. lie killed his father-in-law and wounded his mother-in-law, her eon and grand daughter. After tho shooting be took refuge in a barn and refused to surrender, defying the officers of the law, nntil an attempt was made to set the barn on fire. It was proven that Brown bad been criminally intimate with his wife's thirteen-year-old sister, and it was because of remonstrance from bis that he attempted tho extermination of the family. All the parties involved in the bloody affair formerly resided in Indiana. $100 Reward $100.

At noon her father came home from his work and finding no ono home thonght tho family had gone and ro tnrned to his work. At night Mrs, Bart lett returned and search was made for Mrs. Lindsay. She was found in her room on tho bed dead, having taken morphine some time during tho morn' ing.

The conteits wore passed on at a full mooting of tho commission, as desired by Mr. Williams, tho contestant for the Ninth district cettifioate, Capt.

Tho commission did not pass on the ohief point raised In the cases that of the extent it oonld go in correcting mistakes of tho Gounty Boards bnt threw out tho contests on other grounds. The opinion in tho contest between Williams and Pugh in tbe Ninth was written by Chairman Pry or, of tho commission, and is as follows: "It is not necessary to determine tho extent to which this board can go in correcting mistakes mado by Connty Canvassing Boards. It Is sufficient to say that if this was a Board of Contest, the patty making it has failed to make ont a case." ELEVENTH DISTRICT CONTEST, In passing on the contest in the Eleventh district between Jndgo Boning and John D. White, the independent Republican candidate, the action of tho commission was also unanimous. Mr. White had appeared before tbe board In person and made his argument, tbo ebief points being that Bo re ing had been illegally nominated by party, and that rands bad been practiced, and these were alone referred to in the board's decision giving the certificate. Tho opinion written in tbo case is as follows: "While the party miking tho contest has attempted to demonstrate that the successful candtdatowasnotthenomineo of tbo Republican party, and that fraud was practiced in procuring his election, this board is of the opinion it has no jurisdiction over snob questions."

While in Washington, Gon. Butler spoke to bis friends of bis experience in Cuba. He says tbe Spanish soldiers are orderly and well-behaved as a rule, and tbat tho Cubans are bright and many of them well-educated and fully capable of administering tho government of tbe island. Ho thiuks the Spaniards who will remain in Cnba will got along amicably with tbe Cubans, Gen.

Now, Comptroller of Currency Dawes, who was personally selected by Mr. for tbat position, has made a ttraigbt attack, In bis annual several of the most Impoitant of Secretary Gagos recommendations. It fs reaionably certain that Mr. Dawes did not do this without the knowledge and consent of Mr. McKinloy.

For several years the shops of tbe ' road wero located at Dckovoo, which, witb tbo mines, put about 1,500 inhabitants in the place. When tbo road passed from tbe bands of a rcceircr, tho shops wero moved away. Sevoral weeks ago tho miners, numbering from 300 to 400, went ont on a strike. Latt week Cant.
