The New York Tribune which is fa vorable to the president and in a way mouthpiece of the administration con fesses that: It was to be expected that Presi dent Taft's frank explanation of the manner in which he dictated his fa mous "Winona speech" would provoke some criticism. Explanations rarely explain to the satisfaction of every one. Mr Taft frankly admits that the prep aration of so important an utterance "between stations" was not the course he should have pursued. He does not. however, explain why so important a task was left for such a time and con sequently. perhaps, invites the charge of procrastination. The Tribune proceeds to make the explanation. The president had been against Ballinger. He had been busy being worried and neglected to prepare the important speech which was to have and was intended to have great effect, on the coming primaries and elections. So as the Tribune expresses It he dictated the "Winona speech "be tween stations" on his way to deliver it. This delay and consequent hurry is the Tribune's excuse for the Winona speech. It Is scarcely an explanation which explain.- Th. Wtaon. ««•«•iM «M» orecdcd and lollowed to action which spoke louder than he did at Winona.

NEVER TOO LATE. [Burlington Hawkeye.] There are beautiful old stories of men, who became artists after they had passed the prime of life, or who took up new studies, after they had arrived at the age allotted to man. And some there are, who ask, "What is the good?" To which the proper reply would be, "What Is the good 06 anything?" Too many make the mis take of believing that the work of se curing an education should stop when they leave school or college. That is the saddest of mistakes. Even the busiest of men has a few minutes per day. that he can give to those studies that interested him and appealed to him, and a few minutes every day will, send a man along way in the course of thirty or forty or fifty years, and will enable him to keep pace with and per haps keep ahead of the art or science, the particular branches of knowledge, which he is making his special domain. An education is not finished at col lege, nor anywhere else. But In the school, be it a grammar school, a high school or a college, one Is taught, rath er how to teach himself, than Is one loaded up with sufficient knowledge to carry him thru life. And ln this keep ing up with progress, there lies the solution for all kinds of trouble. There is no such thing as a dun old age, for the studies, and has kept abreast of the times. The large majority of us ought to grow more learned, more ex pert ln the lines that we prefer, as we grow'into grey hairs.

When? •f'iitliar The Lawlessness. -tfi. ...iNe^jiqfli Tribune.]. pleas ofguilty entered by McNamara broU*»rs, one to the mur­ ders In the Jgkipwing up of the Los Angeles Tlm^bulldlng and the other to the subsequent dynamiting of the Llewellyn Iron Workw In Los Angeles, bring home the discredit of these crimes, and wlth&Ut doubt of a rferles of similar ones, to the labor unions. By this "the Tribune does not mean to say that any union as a whole or even any large number of its members were cognizant of the dynamiting outrages. In the very nature of the case it was necessary to confine the knowledge of these crimes to a few persons. The safety of their individual necks re quired that precaution. But the crimes were committed by members of a union, one of them a union officer. They were conceived to be In the Inter ests of the unions, and were the natur al and inevitable fruit of the unionists' policy of tolerating If not secretly en couraging their ends. It was impos sible for union leaders to go on for years winking at the breaking of the non-union laborers' heads and the wan ton destruction of property in strikes without foment-ng that murderous spirit which eniered into the heart cf John J. McNam.ira when, as secre tary of the structural iron workers, lie sent forth his psid dynamiters. The contempt of life which was bred thru the union leaders never lifting their hands to restrain tbeir followers from violence was sure to lead to su^h crimes as those to which the McNa maras have pleaded guilty. It is to be hoped that the result will open the eyes of Gompers and his as sociates to the damnable folly of their course toward lawlessness and violence. Had the union leadens set their faces firmly against personal assaults and the destruction of property had they made their position plain by co-oper ating with the authorities in bringing to Justice any of their followers who In his misguided zeal resorted to vo lence, McXamaralsm would never have developed to bring organized labor in this country to the discredit in which it lies today. And the case of organized labor is afl the worse for the lack of sense and de cency which Gompers and his associ ates displayed when the McNamaras were arrested for the offences to which they have just pleaded guilty. By his utterance® then Gompers did his ut most to make the cause of the accused dynamiters the cause of the labor unions themselves. He pronounced the case against the McNamaras a con spiracy of capital, and left himself and organized labor without means of re treat from such a catastrophe a-s this which has Just befallen them. His thunders were calculated to inspire any murderous unionist like the Mc Namaras with confidence that If he us.ed dynamite all the resources of or ganized labor In this country would be employed in his dehalf. Thus he lent encouragement to violence. He may now see the fruit of that policy long pursued and fatuously adhered to, even in the face of what was plainly Im pending at Los. Angeles. Blot on the Internal Revenue Report. There are some features of the in ternal revenue report for the last fiscal year. Just made public, as there have been with reference to similar exhibits ln previous years, that are anything but edifying. The treasury derived no less than $322,526,299 from Internal tax ation. fully two-thirds of which was raised on articles of commerce of which the production Is a' detriment rather than a benefit to the nation and its people. There are many honest-mind ed citizens who do not mince words or attempt to soften terms when discuss ing some of the recognized sources of national revenue. It is unpleasant to admit it. perhaps, but the country has an unsavory reputation abroad, as has recently been made evident by com ment upon th.? prevalence of certain forms of lawlessness and .recklessness here, and still more unpleasant Is it to be confronted by the fact that this is largely due to the legitimatizing of a traffic that Is unquestionably a breeder of vice and crime and every form of human misery. For the present it will be better, per haps. to turn away from those featuees of the report which in the years to come the historian of this civilization will strive in vain to reconcile with some American pretensions to decency, and to consider only the rewults achieved thru the application of a new form of taxation. The corporations are now paying their license fees as a mat ter of course. They have fallen into the way of doing it very rapidly. No less than 270.202 of them were sub ject to the corporation tax last year, an Increase of "712 over the number that made returns the previous cal endar year, the first In which the new tax wae operative. These 270,202 cor porations had an aggregate capital stock of $67.886,430,519, a figure that would have amazed even the most op timistic industrial expansionist of a quarter of a century ago. All the sta tistics connected with them are on a similar scale. They have bonded and other Indebtedness, for Instance, of $ 30,715,336.005, and their aggregate net income amounts to $3,360,250,842 an nually. They contributed $38,811,825 In taxes during the last fiscal year, or a little more than one-tenth of the total Internal revenue. How much more the "big businesses' of the country could bear In the shape of taxes than they are bearing now Is a question that would have- to be very carefully considered, but it may be taken as practically settled that many of them would gladly Increase their contributions to the revenue if thereby they might be assured exemption from the numerous attacks that are being made upon them under present condi tion. The fact that those who profit most by the trusts and combines are disposed to part generously with their wealth after it has been accumulated would seem to prove that money for Its own sake is not, after all, the great, est Incentive to the energy of the American business man.

Dec. 5.—President Taft's annual message, which In Court was read both houses of congress today, This deals exclusively with the anti-trust statute. The full text of the message iB as fol­ lows: To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: message Is the first of several which 1 shall send to con gress during opening the interval between the of its regular session and Ita adjournment for the Christmas holi days. The amount of information to be communicated as to the operations ot the government, the number of Impor tant subjects calling for comment by the executive, and the transmission to congress of exhaustive reports by spe cial commissions, make it impossible to include ln one message of a reason able length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the atten tion of the national legislature at Its first .regular session. The Anti-Trust Law The Supreme Decisions. In May last the Supreme court by hand­ ed down decisions ln the suits in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of the Ameri can Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. The decisions are epoch making and serve, to advise the busi nsss world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anti-trust act ol 1890. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court in construing and applying this Important statute, but they clarify those important deci sions further defining the already admitted exceptions to the literal con struction of the act. By the decrees, they furnish a the useful precedent as proper method of dealing capital and to with the property ot Illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make it easier for the entire business community to square with the rule of action and thus finally established legality and to preserve the benefit, freedom and spur sonable competition without of rea­ loan of real efficiency or progress. Ne Change In the Rule of Decision— Merely In Its Form of Expression. The statute In Its first section de clares to he Illegal "every contract combination la the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations," and In the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine or conspire with any other person to monopolise any part of the trade or commerce of the several states or with foreign nations." In two early cases, where the statute was Invoked to enjoin a transportation agreement between Interstate railroad companies, it was held that It was no defense to show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonal at common law, because It was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and combinations ln re straint of trade whether reasonal at common law or not It was plain from the record, however, that the contracts complained of ln those cases would not have been deemed reasonable at common law. In subsequent eases the court said that the statute should be given a reasonal construction and re fused to Include within Its Inhibition certain contractual restraints of trade which It dominated as incidental or as Indirect These cases of restraint of trade that the court excepted from the operation of the statute were Instances which, at common law, would have been called reasonable. In the Standard Oil and Tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the tests of the com mon law, and in defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute, only substituted for the teat of being Incidental or Indirect, that ot being reasonable and this, without varying In the slightest the sctual scope snd effect of the statute. In other words, all thi cases under the ststute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way If the court had originally accepted In Its construc tion the rule at common law. It baa been said that the court, by introducing Into the construction c" the statute common law distinctions, haa emasculated it This is obviously untrue. By Us judgment every con tract and combination to restraint ct interstate trade made with the purpose or nscseaary-effect at terms wholly unnecessary the licensing and legltla»tlsbig of a trtufflc that makes tar physical and nagpu iirtih The teat of reasonableness was never applied by the court at com mon-law to contracts or combinations or conspiracies ln restrslnt of trade whose purpose was or whose neces sary effect would be to stifle competi tion, to control prices, or establish monopolies. The courts never as sumed power to say that such con tracts or combinations or conspira cies might be lawful if the parties to them were only moderate ln the use ot the power thus secured and did not exact from the public too great and exorbitant prices. It is true that many theorists, and others en gaged in business violating the statue, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts hut no court of authority haa aver *t tempted It Certainly there Is noth ing in the decisions ot the latest two cases which should he a dangerous theory of judicial discretion in en forcing this statue can derive the slightest sanction. Force and Effectlveneee of Statute a Matter of Growth, We have been twenty-one years making this statue effective tor the purposes for which It wss enacted. The Knight ease waa discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the errors of that judgment waa corrected, and only In the last three or four years has the heavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations thst have exercised such an absolute do minion over many of our Industries. Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number' are pending, but juries have felt averse to convict ing for jail sentences, and judges have been most reluctant to Impose such sen? fences on men of respectable standing ln society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, es the offense becomes better under stood and the committing of It par takes more of studied and deliberate defiance of the law, we can be confi dent that Juries will convict individ uals and that jail'sentences will be Imposed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution. In the Standard Oil case the Su preme and circuit courts found the combination to be a monopoly of the Interstate business of refining, trans porting. and marketing petroleum and its products, effected and, .maintained through thirty-seven different cor porations, the stock of which was held by a New Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer snd pro-rata distribution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by it In the thirty-seven corporations to and among its stock holders. and the corporations and in dividual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining to re store such monopoly and all agree ments between the subsidiary corpor ations tending to produce or bring about further violations ot the act were enjoined. In the Tobacco ease, the court found that the individual defendants, twenty-nine in number, bad been en gaged ln a successful effort to ac quire complete dominion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco In this country and abroad, and that this had been done by com binations made with a purpose and effect to stifle competition, control prices, and establish a monopoly, not only in the manufacture of tobacco, but also of tin-foil and Ileorijjp used In its manufacture and of its products of cigars, cigarettes, and snuffs. The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than the Standard Oil suit for a decree which Trculd 1h«t win the controlling prlcee by stifling competition, or of establish ing in whole or ln part a monopoly of such trade. Is condemned by the stat ute. The moet extreme critics cannot Instance a ease that ought to be con demned under the statute which Is not brought wlthla Its terms as thus con strued. The sifsstlfiB Is also saade that the Supreme coart by Its decision tar the last two casss has committed to'the court the undefined snd unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint at trade la wlthla the at and the statute.
