At an Informal gathering or a number or Senators Saturday it was made evident that the Western men would stand together to ubtalu control or the coiuintuccs which dealt specially with Western questions. The si heme tor the enlargement or the 1'inance Committee also received the favor able indorsement of the meeting, and the opinion was expressed that Senators Cam eron nnd Piatt shoald be selected to rill Ihe two places which will be at the demand or tliu Republicans In case they organize the Senate and the committee Is enlarged. THE CHAIRMANSHIPS. The most Important matter to the mem bers or the House Just now is the composi tion of the committees. Mr. Reed has made no promises with reference to chairman ships or to committee assignments. He is besieged, though, with friends of gen tlemen who would like lo have this or Hint. Aud It Is not slranue that the prefer ences or such members as Dlngley. Pajne. Dalzell. Urosveuor. nnd Hopkins should have weight. They are entitled to prefer ence. The people of Washington are especially Interested in the District Committee. Rep resentative Babcotk. of Wisconsin, would like to head this coil 'Utce. He Is well fitted for the ihalrnahs...p and stood sec ond in the minority last year. Gen.llarmar of Pennsylvania, was the ranking Repub lican, but It is understood his health will not tieriuit him to take suih an activu prt as the chairmanship of this committee would require. The Republican House caucus Is over, so Is the contest for offices. The victors have been congratulated. A combine is n great thlug when you're In It. Early yesterday Major McDowell re ceived a note of congratulation rrom Gen. Henderson and Ihe same came to each or the others In the combine who won. The vanquished are'gone. Gen. Hender son closed his headquarters nnd left the city aN soon as he'ciiuld get away. Col. Tipton, as Jolly as ever and with lots or experience, lert last, night. The ministers are still here, bJt that' was to be expected. The friends of the -victors spent the dav at McDowell headquarters. Congratula tions came in from all sides. Eerybody was hapny. ' The frleuds of (he vanquished spent the day enjoying the beauties of nature. It was a lovely day and they all took ad vantage of getting outr since they had Ho headauarters to Mslt, THE PaRTYS POLICY. Mr. Reed's speech was the main topic of conversation during the day. It was generally admitted that. he struck the key note of Republican actiun during the next two vcars. It Is conceded that the party will attempt some" clianges in the present tarlfr and that It wfisurge the vlyiricatlon or Ihe Monroe docirinev-It means noth ing else ir this is the "greatest nation" on the hemisphere. , - The state or the. Treasury will demand the attention or the legislators the first thing. There will be' an effort made to provide for deficiencies, "hut 11 must be along Republican litiCe. The receipts will be increased., and Mr. Clc"land will be expected to give in. The Increase must come from custom duties, uot from the internal revenue. The party Is opposed to "nopguu" bills as such, but sucli a bill Is liable to be In troduced. It will not call for a general revision, but will put duties on such ar ticles as wool and woolen goods, tin. pottery, etc. In this way deficiencies will be met. But to do this the Senate must be Re publican, too. That Is one reason why the Republican Senators hold a caucus this arternoon. Thelinpressionlsgalnlngground that an attempt to reorganize will be made at once. A number or Senators have put themselves on record lo this effect. These same gentlemen have a number of reforms in view. One of them Is the distribution of the appropriation bills among the various Benate committees. They hold that in this way the business of the Senate can be greatly expedited. Representative Grout or Vermont Is also snoken or in this connection. He was chairman ot this committee during the llfty-nrst Congress and mane a great record for himseir. One dirriculty may be the assignment of bis colleague, Mr. Powers. t.o a chairmanship. In this case Mr. Grout would be out of the ronlest. Last niirht Renresentntlve Payne of New York seemed to be the favorite for clialrmanship of the Ways and Means Com mittee. His chief 'opponent seems to be Mr. Dlngley. but there is a growing be lief that Mr. Dlngley does not want it. Mr. Payne has the advantaf .? or rour scars- serrlr-p. The committee will not be the important one 11 has been In Congress be fore. The Committee on Banking and currency will probably le or more Importance than the Wavs and Means. Mr. Walker of Mas sachusetts would like this appointment There Is some talk or Mr. Dlngley being placed here. 

HENDERSON'S BERTH. Representative Henderson or Iowa seems booked far the Appropriations Committee. Mr. Boutelle Is s.ifd to have expressed a desire to be relieved from service on the Naval Committee, and it such Is the case Mr. Doinver or Iowa may succeeu Amos Cumminirs of New York. The Elections Committee will be or the utmost importance. Thirty-four contests come before It. and the committee must work. Mr. Dalzell of Pennsylvania could have It. but he dues not want It. Ex-Gov. Stone of Pennsylvania will most likely succeed to the chairmanship of the Commltteeon Coinage. Weights and Measures. For a number of years he has written either the minority, or majority report of this committee, and is now the ranking Republican member. His selec tion seems certain. . Mr. Hepburn is spoken of in connection with Ihe Committee on interstate and For eign Commerce. Mr. Hitr of Illinois, is to be chairman of the Committee on For eign Affairs, one of the, most Important in the House. There are several candidates for Ihe chairmanship of the Committee on Post orrices. It Is said Representative Bing ham prefers lo remain on the Committeo on Appropriations- 'Mr. Hull has desires In this way. especially If Mr. Bingham Is assigned to appropriations On Mr. Bing ham's action depends the fate of another prominent Pcnnsyivanlan. Mr. Mahan of Pennsylvania, who is in line of promotion, wants to go to the head of the Committee: on'War Claims. COMMITTEE1 ON RULES. The composition, of the Committee on Rules Is creating much guessing. When Mr. Reed was Speaker before he associated with himself on this committee the chair men of the Ways and .Means and Appro priation Committees..! iSpeaker Crisp de parted from this precedent and divided ud the leadership on the; floor ot the House. Whether Mr. Reed will do this is puzzling Ihe guessers. One thing seems certain. Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, will be en that committee. The expressed opinion is that he could have anything that he wants, and that he will be choice In his selection. He is to be one of the leaders on the floor. Qen. Grosvenor wants to remain on the Ways and Means Committee. Hels spoken of for the chairmanship ot the River and Harbor Committee, but It is thought lie will not interfere with -"V fight between Represent atlTes-Hooker, jt New York, and Herman, of Oregon. ' The Southern Republicans are not press ing any person 'especially, bat hope for recognition. Therr'-are a number of nice committees for some ot them to take care ot- ?

Dec 1. A private letter re ceived in tblscity by Dr. A. Lopez, and dated Santiago dc Cuba, November 28. brings "tne news ot the arrest of five filibusters' who landed on November 16, near Agua dorea. The writer says: Late at night the sentries of the fort or Aguadores saw a small boat manned by five men. approaching thecoast.

Wheu off that Point a skitr put on irom snore, towing tour large yawl boats, which were re ceived by the stranger. Berore her arrival a tugboat, coming from the direction of the Delaware Breakwater. lert the yawls atthepitrand then quickly steamed away. SAILED WITH THE VESSEL. rilot Jeremiah Eldrcdge landed from the mysterious craft, but would give no information as to her name, character or destination. Foursirange men. who looked like Cubans, superintended the embarka tion of the boais nnd sailed away with the steamer after the work was completed. A report Is circulated here that the same steamship lay off the cape during tbo night, where arms and ammunition were taken on board from a schooner, whose mjsterious movements attracted the atten tion or Ihe lire saving crew. It is further reported that the large yards are to bo loaded with the6e warlike appliances and manned by daring crews, and will be droa ped on 'the coast of Cuba, as the vessel stearus through MonaPassage. Inthiswav they hope to run the blockade, and com municate with the Cuban Insurgents army. The vessel apparently came down Ihe Dela ware river from Philadelphia. The steamship Horsa, whose captain and first and second mates were recently ar rested and held In ball for tho charge or alleged filibustering, sailed from Phila delphia yesterday afternoon, and -ld have, easily beeu ofr the Delaware capes at the time of the approach of the vessel to tho ocean pier at Cape May. It Is thought by many here that the vessel was the Horsa. FELL UPON THE SPANIARDS. Rebel Leader G II Defent-.Col.Hotcer's Coin mi. Santiago de Cuba. Nov. 24. via Key West. Fla., Dec 1.

REFUGEES SENT BACK BOME Delay in n Settlement Infers That Jealousies Exist An ng the Power. .Ml-odonurfe-i In the Caewireu Dis trict Are Deported to He in Im minent Danger. London, Dec. 1. The representative at Constantinople ot the United States tele graphing under yesterday's dale, pictures a pitiable condition of utiatrs at-Harpoot. where tbe American mission buildings were burped ai the time ot tbe recent massacre there. The representative of the United Press, has received aavices from llnrnoot tttiowinir that there. Is creat danser of hundreds of the poorer ciasseo of .Armenians 6iarving 10 ueuin. T"ne perU tuil confronts tnese people Is an immediate one. They are absolutely without food and without the means ot getting any. The people are now In a condition of ajutny. and many ot them, it is belieed, would welcome death at tbe hands or their enemies rather than to await the slow process or starvation. Some, however, who nave a little money ot their own, or who have beensecretlyassisted by comparatively well-to-do compatriots, arerieeing to small jilaces In the Interior, where they hope to better their miserable condition. They run tne risk ot being massacred en route as tbe government will furnish them not the sllgbiest protection. REFUGEES SENT HOME. Those Armenians who have fled to Con stantinople think that. In the capital, they would be more or less under me protection ot the representatives or the various powers, and be sate from cold blooded massacre, but the government In the case of the refugees is enforcmrr the principle of serfdom, that every sub ject is bound to the soil, and every day large numbers of Arnienlausare arrested. At night they are shlpjied In batches to the places where they were born, with the warning that it will be tetter for them to remain there. The representative ot the United Tress further says that no progress has been made in the negotiations between the ambassadors and the jiorte relative to the admission into ihe Bosphorus of a second guard ship for each or the powers which signed the treaty or Berlin. The delay that has occurred uvtr the set tlement ot this question leads to tbe belief that the concert of the powers is not as nerrect as is claimed, aud that Jealousies that have hi'herto been latent are now actively working in a manner that aids the sultan in working une iiower against another. DEFINITE COURSE NEEDED. It is held that It all tho powers were agreed upou a definite course to be pur sued tbe question of admitting the extra guard snips would be settled at once by the issue of Firmans permitting their entry into tbe liosphorus, ana that other vexations diplomatic questions would be speedlly di-jiosed nf. Recently a number of unknown men, pre sumably iwlice or government officials, visited a number ot houses occupied by Armenians and made notes of tbe number ot persons in each. They refused" to enter into any explanation of their action, and thelrproceeniugs havelncreased tne anxiety felt by tbe Armenians and other Christians In the city. It Is feared that thetaklng such a census is a preliminary to the wholesale driving oat of the Armenians ot Constanti nople. MISSIONARIES IN DANGER. Considerable anxiety is felt regarding the safety of the missionaries at Caesarea. fifty-rive miles northwest of Jerusalem, owing to a report that a fanatical Mus sulman outnreak is imminent at that puce. An olflcial note states tbat a conflict was provoked at Zilea, in the vilayet or Sivas. by the murder of a Mussulman b van Armenian. The Mussulmans attempted to revenge me ucain or tceir co-reiiginnist and In tbe fighting that ensued four Mus sulmans and five Armenians were killed. lbe local authorities restored order.
