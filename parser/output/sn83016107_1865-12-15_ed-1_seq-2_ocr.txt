The Message, in our opinion, is well written, frank and clear. True, the doctrines and views it puts forth arc not en tirely new. They seem to ns to be about thcsnme | which Mr. Johnson lias frequently, of hue, given I to the various committees who have from time to j lime waited upon him. It is very clear from the i Message, that its distinguished author is anxious i for reconstruction, and that be clearly reoog- | nixes State Rights to a considerable extent, and 1 it is generally conceded, that the Message is an j able and conciliatory Slate paper. We give below copious extracts from Southern papers, all of which speak well of the message. } These people are deeply interested in the views | of the President just now, and it appears to us, j that their construction of the Message would be ! much more interesting to our readers than any j of it which wo could make al this late { date. It will lie seen from the extracts referred to, that some of the Southern papers speak in very high terms of the policy of Mr. Johnson, his ability as a statesman, and his firmness and hon esty as a man : [From (he Uichmoml Titan j The message is the production of a statesman who discarded all passions and prejudices from his breast, and dismissed all considerations of party from bis councils. There is a calm, clear, dispassionate resolution in his views, and an ut ter ignoring of the temporary issues engendered by fanaticism and kept alive by the passions in flamed by civil war, which showed that be feels I that he is tight, and that time will vindicate bis | wisdom and partrimism. Important as are tbeolHcial opinions of Prcsi- 1 dent Johnson as to the rights of the Stales and ' the powers of the Federal Governmctit, they are i destitute of the charm of novelty, because he 1 long since announced them in his interview with 1 the South Caroiina committee which solicited i the appointment of Governor Perry. The doc- 1 trines of secession and consolidation arc alike j repudiated by him in his clear and simph state ment of his conception of the nature of our Gov ernment. What is set forth id the President's annual message is also precisely what he lias declared to every intelligent gentleman who has conversed with him upon the subject of bis policy of recon struction. His argument against the monstrobs policy of establishing military governments in the Southern Stales is pet haps one of the most striking and forcible portions of his message. It will arrest public attention, and carry convic tion to every breast which is not the‘abode of passions and sectional prejudices uuworlliv of our race. To the South the firm, decided opinions of the President upon this subject will mug unspeaka ble joy. As the Comthaiider-iu-Ohief of the army and navy he can, at any moment, remove the military, and, as the President of the Uni ted States, he can, by the exercise of the veto power, prevent the consummation of all Radical schemis (or garrisoning the South. He is com- : pletely master of the position, and although a Radical Congress may exclude our representa tives, they cannot make us the victims of unjust I and oppressive legislation. The whole tone of the Message convinces us that the present Congress can do nothing worse ‘ than deny us the representation to which we are 1 entitled. Their power for mischief begins ami 1 ends with that causeless insult nnd affront to the , South—the exclusion of our delegates. In the frank, manly announcement of the President, tnat he has taken every necessary step 1 to restore the Constitutional relations of the Southern States, and desires them to ‘'resume i their places in both branches of the National i Legislature, aud thereby complete the work of restoration,” as soon us they have adopted "the ' Constitutional amendment abolishing slavery,' 1 ' —bo makes a fair, bold issue with Congress.* ’ i He invites the Southern States to speedily and unanimously adopt that amendment, am! de clares that its adoption reunites us beyond all | 1 power of disruption. We have, in doing this 1 he tells us, a certain means of casting all the dia- | orders of the past into oblivion, and this w ill be , the crowning evidence of our sincere desire tor future maintenance of the Union. This measure will efface the sad memory of the past, and will t eventually secure the South population, capital i aud the warm sympathies of the people of the j North. Beyond this the President demands ' nothing at our hands but that protection for the 1 emancipated negro which nil of ns are willing I to afford him, as an honest and industrious la- , borer. The Message of President Johnson will dissi- 1 pate all apprehensions as to his earnest desire for 1 amnesty and oblivion of past offences. "Every patriot,” he says, "must wish for a general am nesty at the earliest epoch consistent witn public safety.” He slitcs that after "the late terrible conflict” there "must be a spirit of mutual eon- i ciliation,” and we "must work together in har- i mony." Profoundly interested as the people of the South are in that portion of the President’s Mes sage which wc have considered, we shall not pre tend to discuss any oilier portion of it at this time. We rise from the perusal of this Message almost overcome wilh emotions of thankfulness to God, that between our defeated section and the howl ing passions of a Radical Congress there is inter posed the granite will of Andrew Johnson. Aghlnst that noble, Heaven-inspired, resolute patriotism which this man exhibits, the storm of sectional rage aud Jacobin passions beats as idly as the. waves against some lofty cliff, which na ture has reared to check the fury of the sea.— The cold, cairn and resolute statesmanship of the President of the whole nation will eventually de feat the roaring, raging spirit of (action which has taken temporary possession of Congress, if the men who were elected when the passions which were inflamed to madness by the war 1 have not discovered that Hie war is now at an I end, the President has made that discovery. I In the contest which must now Ire waged by ' Radicalism upon the policy of the President, the I exclusion of onrßepresentalivesisthe worst that | can befall us. That, however, is a serious evil I and a monstrous outrage, the consideration of I which we must postpone until to-morrow. Thb President having officially announced the j single condition for our readtuission which he ' demands of the South, it becomes our imperative | duty to strengthen his position by a projppt i acquiescence in his wishes. [ From the Uichmoml Sentinel.] The message is not to us. it wasscnl to Con- i cress, but our representatives were not there to near because they were not allowed to be there. ' It is a comfort that this exclusion is not la har-; mony wjth the views of Hie executive; hut so j (oog s our right of parllclpnHob iu the Oovi-rn l tnent is denied or withhold, we can feel but little inclination to indulge in what our space to-day forbids, tiie idle comment of a mere looher-on. [From the Petersburg Int/ex.] There is nothing to indicate that ihe President is dissatisfied with the plan he adopted on ma lt ure consideration, or that he conceives there is any just ground for a further continuance ofdis ; un on. In the present temper of Congress, however, | it is apparent that all speculations in this matter must end, as the message docs, with an interro ; gatiou point. Meanwhile, wc comfort ourselves with the re [ flection that the President is as alien ns our selves. Tennessee, like Virginia, is not a State in the American Union. This is possibly what Phillips meant by "The South Victorious.” [From (he Petersburg Exprttt.] Those who expected n calm, temperate, con- Iservative discussion of the various questions | which since the termination of the war have per [ plexert anjl disturbed the minds of the people, i North, and South, will not be disappointed J The President has, iu every point of view, ac | quitted himself in the message in a manner to | give general satisfaction. He goes for const! tu- I lional observances and for measures that will i tend to restore tranquility, harmony and fraterni ty to the nation at the earliest day. His views | of the mutual relations ct the Constitution and the States are founded upon that broad national j phrase in the preamble, "wo the peopled' the \ United Stiles,” and upon those equally broad and national words in. the Constitution, which declare it to bo the "supreme law of the hind, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding." The President reasons with great force upon this j head and his conclusions will, no doubt, be ac | quiesced iu by Hie people of the South after their j disastrously vain attempt to establish the oppos i mg doctrines of Stale Sovereignty. | A "general amnesty” is spoken ot and fore- I shadowed, hut the President says that the time 1 for it has not yet come. Ho strongly intimates, I however, that as soon ns the Constitutional ' amendment abolishing slavery shall he rati fied by all the .States lately in rebellion, this great | measure of relief will he adopted. His language ' on this subject is emphatic aud impressive. 

GENERAL BANKS. j This individual was serenaded one eiening j lost week, at Willard's in Washington. He of : course responded, and during his speech, eulogis j tic of the Union, liberty, and the President, he j said : You may be assured that whatever may he in my power here or elsewhere in public life to do for the great cause of human freidora I shall most cheerfully perform, nnd I believe that ef forts of statesmen will be directed to the object of securing freedom, prosperity, and peace in Hie Union of the States, to the loyal mco of the South, both white and black. Wc h ive no rea son to be discouraged at the prospect before us Although the problem to lie solved is difficult and dangerous, the capacity of the people is suf ficiently great to conquer every difficulty. Of course, Mr. Banks is intensely loyal, and there are two reasons for it; one is that his par- I ty is in power, and the other is that President | Johnson has declared himself in favor of the i Union and Constitution; nnd Banks, being a j natural slider, found but little difficulty in sliding j into Hie ranks of President Johnson, and re ; m,lining there, or hypocritically pretending to i remain there, ss long as it is politically profita -1 hie. This distinguished warrior is over-joyed at | the chances and prospects of the degradation of the white race, and ttie great probability of his rapid fall to the level of the negro. Perhaps be may be willing to take the little negro girl into his family as on equal, who, he tells in bis famous report of the Shenandoah Expedition, that he re lieved ; this was disinterested friendship, and re quired great calmness and courage ; for it will be remembered that this negro child was actual ly taken from Hie road, aud put iulo an ambu lance or wagon of some sort, nnd that all this was done ditripg that never to-hc-ibi gotten race, in which the time made, says the hero in his re port of the affair, was at the rate of "two-for- UV' Now it would be difficult to discover, we think, much Unionism about a man who one year befot o the war, on the Hoot- of the House of Representatives, deliberately used these words: "1 am willing, in a certain state of circumstances, to let the Union slide yet these are the very words used by this very loyal man. The cir cumstances under which ho would let the Union slide, were, wc suppose, that iu case Ids party was put out of power, and in the event of the negro equality doctrine, as taught by abolition ism, proving a failure—then, to save cither of them, he was willing to let the Union slide. Bsn BtiTt.aa Again.— lt has not been long since Gen. Grant showed this warrior, who "march ed up the hill ar.d then marched down again,” iu his true character. Hut this Massachusetts beast was not permitted to gel over the just casti gation which General Grant gave him in his re port, before lie received another equally severe at the bands of Mr. Hurst, a member of the Vir ginia legislature from Norfolk county. It has for some timo been rumored that the hero of the Dutch Gap Ganal was soon to take charge, of the military department ofVirginia, and we suppose that Mr. Hurst, from his location in the Stale, was somewhat familiar with Butler's natural propen sity for appropriating the property of others to his own use. Naturally enough, under such cir cumstances, he took ground against bis appoint ment to that position. At any rale, he offered a resolution on the Bth inst., referring to the re port that Butler was about to lake charge of the military department which includes Virginia, and impugning the hero's honesty, in severe and sarcastic terms.

There j ! is hut little doubt that the negro would have I | dona him set ions injury, but for the timely in- i ! terferenee of another negro, who happened to be passing at the lime. Mr. Rockhoid is unable to j account for the assault made upon him, unless i the object whs robbery. The negro is a dis | charged soldier, and when arrested on Sunday last, resisted the officer with much violence. Tim Democratic Advocate—This is the title of a new Democratic paper, just started at West minster, by William H. Davis, Esq.

The New Sc .clastic Order. A man uamod Thomas Cook, living at Huntsville, Indiana, has established a new j socialistic community at that place. It is ! styled “The in dependent Order of Fi ee and i ] Independent Mon and Women," and de- i | dares all its members independent and free | ; of all externa! powers, such as human ru ! lers and human governors, so far as it is I possible lor human souls at present to ho.

The children, in ac< r tain seine, will be given “tho democratic power of choosing their own parents. With this preface no one will be sur prised to learn that the principles of foice and compulsion are discarded ; that each member is guided aud governed by the spirit of perfect love, which gives an mi bounded spirit of canty and forbear ance, easts out doubting, emancipates the soul from all forms and conventionalities, and gives unrestrained freedom.

Can You Tell Us* Scarcely an individual in the North hut remembers the hue aud cry raised by the Abolitionists a few years ago on ac count of the expinditims of the Post Office Department over running the in come. The deficiency was framed upon the S out hern Slates for not piying their share of the postal expenses, and was Used us an argument to prove that we of the North would be better off separated from the Smin, than iu connection with it. It was one of the chief strings upon j which they played to waken the feeling that bus now ripened into war and blood shed.
