His 900-acre farm in DeGroat town ship is one of the best in the county. He has made a fortune out of it, and he richly deserves all the blessings that have been show ered upon him.

POWER TO SELL BONDS. I urgently recommend that to support the existing gold standard, and to maintain "the parity in value of the coins of the two metals (gold and silver), and the equal power of every dollar at all times in the market and in the payment of debts," the secretary of the treasury be given additional power and charged with the duty to sell United States bonds, and to em ploy such other effective means as may be necessary to these ends. COMBINES ARE TRUSTS. It is universally conceded that combinations which engross or control the market of any parti cular kind of merchandise or com modity necessary to the general community, by suppressing natural and ordinary competition whereby prices are unduly enhanced to the general consumer, are obnoxious not only to the common law but also to the public welfare. There must be a remedy for the evils in volved in such organizations. If the present law can be extended more certainly to control or check these monopolies or trusts, it should be done without delay. Whatever power the congress pos sesses over this most important subject should be promptly a tained and asserted.
