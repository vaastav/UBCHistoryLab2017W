It* ON INTERVENTION (Continued from First Page.) hands of Minister de Lome. Gen. Blanco will do his best to give the minister means with which to keep it in check, but in some things Mr. de Lome Is asking impossibil itiis. The captain general is not fully I>osted on tiie plans of the insurgents. He cannot furnish the minister in advance with news of engagements in which it may be necessary to deny their success. They did lay siege to Guisa, in the eastern pa:-t of the island, and take it after a fierce bembardmtnt. That information could not be suppressed until the Spanish troops got reinforcements and regained the ruins. The insurgents are going to be pretty ac tive, and it is reasonable to leek for an occasional success on their part, though this will not be conclusive of ultimate vic tory. Inniirgpnlii' Idean of Xeur Future. Mention ci i.he irsnrgents brings back the lnteriogation point. They have their j ideas c.bout the "near future." Some of tlem think that it means the coming Feb ruary. Insurgents proper ate not suppos ed to uwell in' Havana. There are, how ever. persons denominated as sympathiz ers v.-'io appear to be accurately inform ed of yhat is going on in the field and of lliet opinions of the men who are carrying the guns and the machetes. This class has shown a surprising complacency over the President's argument that they are net entitled to the recognition either of independence or belligerency. To the lat ter little attention is now raid. For a month i;ast the whole drift has been away frcm it- I have been repeatedly assured sir.ee reaching Cuba that when Congress acts it will recognize independence. The assurances on that point are perhaps a iittle stronger here tl>an in Washington. Xo definite reason, however. Is given foi the belief that independence will be rec ognized in February. Spain may be OOO.inr) closer to bankruptcy, the insur gents may be keeping ali the forces Gen. Blanco can command busy in the flelil. the volunteers In Havana may still be threatening an uprising, yet the evidences of a decisive move of any kind are not convincing enough to warrant predicting that the crash will come then. However, it must be recorded that the insurgent definition of a "reasonable time" and thu ! "pear future" is two months as contra d.stingnished from the official Spanish con struction of a year. What Worrlm the SpiinUll Kleiueut. The mtransigentes. or ultra-Spaniard ele ments. have not been taken into account in \ these comments. One reason was that they declined to give an account of themselves. For a few days they chose to ignore the President's message and Congress as some thing beneath the notice of loyal Spaniards. But the resentment of the intransigentes ] is too deep to be entirely smothered. With the youthful volunteers it blazes out at times and disappears. With the older ones ] it burns steadily. Viewed in the abstract, this consistency of hatred toward the United States has the quality of steadiness that provokes admiration. While their sen timent shows itself, the ultra-Spaniarus do not undertake to answer the questions as to what constitutes a reasonable time or the near future. Some of them probably feel that the United States, having slept on the right of intervention, which Mr. Cleveland asserted and which President McKinley reasserts, through the acute period of Weyler's despotism, there is no need to fear action at all. The assertion that such a right exists is what wounds them. It is this which fills them with a bitterness that cannot be appreciated in other surroundings. "American policy with Cuba," they say, "is a blow at Spain's sov ereignty." And, though Spain's sovereign ty in Cuba today is a shadow, the loyal Spaniard will war with the United States to vindicate liis patriotism. He is girding his sword for the day of straggle, when, if the shadow must be yielded, it shall be yielded "with honor." The American Colony. The colony of Americans in Havana has also its opinion of what a reasonable time means. The opinion is a collective one with individual variations. "If left to Spain it means till eternity," growled one of them whose business Interests on the island were once quite extensive. Now they are repre sented by claims for damages by Spanish troops and Insurgents filed in the pigeon holes of the State Department to be con sidered along with others, possibly, as a set-off to Spain's allegation of damages from filibustering. His losses have soured his judgment somewhat. Other Americans place the near future at from three to five months. They do not appear to conceive of another year going by without intervention. Some of them for business reasons would like to see Spain succeed with autonomy. They are watching closely for the signs of pacification, which will enable trade and industry to be resumed even in limited de gree. But they as yet find little encourage ment. though trade is a trifle better since Weyler's grip was loosened. They are skep tical of Spain's ability to successfully gov ern Cuba under any system, and they are i.ot enamored of the Cubans or the Cu bans' capacity for self-government. So their opinions come as near to being im partial as it is possible to find among so many conflicting interests. Probably this hard-headed and unsentimental American view n:ay be accepted as a trustworthy in dex of the weight of opinion. It is not uni versal because the Boston capitallsts.whose plantations are around Clenfuegos, still find the country pacified and the people not starving. One of.thein. Mr. Stlllman, Is just back from Cienfuegos. His own ex perience is worth giving. He found no in surgents and. except at Trinidad, no suffer ing from hunger. There was distress in that neighborhood, but it was not due to j the war or the acts of the government be cause the people had been suffering front hunger for the past six years. Still food can be had. "Cats," said Mr. Stillman, ?'are sold for cents apiece." When the market price of cats at Trini dad is only "M cents it may be hypercritical to assume that a condition of peace and prosperity has not been reached which will free the United States front fur ther responsibility in Cuban affairs Yet it must be recorded that this feeling exists. The majority of Americans agree with the minority of Spaniards and the majority of Cubans that the time necessary to demonstrate that Cuba is pacified and autonomy established cannot be stretched so as to avoid the intervention of the Unit ed States.

Just west of the city, and Tuesday evening President McKinley and wife and officials from Washington who attend the funeral will leave for the capital, reaching there about noon Wednesday. Rev. Dr. Manchester, the pastor of the church, has announced that it is his desire and that he will extend an invitation to have the ministers, of all the churches, of wnich there are about thirty, occupy the pulpit and participate in the services.

Judge Cox today signed decrees divorcing Mary Rose Tucker from George H. Tucker and Sadie E. Long from Frank H. Long. In her petition flietl August last Mrs. Tucker stated that she was married to the defendant at St. Dominic's Church, Octo ber 1(5, 1879. They lived together until Christmas day, 1WH5, she explained, when her husband, in a lit of rage, left her. since which time her mother has cared for her four children and herself. Judge Cox reserved his decision in regard to alimony. The custody of the children was awarded to the mother. In the Long case desertion was the ground on which the divorce was granted. The couple were married December 31. 1892, and Mrs. Long charged that her husband, without cause, deserted her August 18. 1805. From Washington to Baltimore. From the Hal timers gun. The Laurel Leader calls attention to the Importance of a good wagon road between Baltimore and Washington. It Is incredi ble that the construction of such a high way should have been omitted all these years. The railroads in no wise do away with the necessity for such a roa 1. The railroads have built up a series of villages between the two cities, which in time will constitute a continuous settlement stretch ing from the suburbs of one city to those ol tne other. This growth would be great ly promoted by a good highway, along which the villagers could take pleasure drives, ride their bicycles and maintain so cial relations. A fine road between ave nues of trees would speedily become al most a street stretching from city to city. It would be a favorite road for ulcyclera from the cities. Wayside Inns for their entertainment would grow up, veal es tate would Improve in value and the coun ties in which the road would lie would get a revenue from taxpayers which would be a tremendous return for the outlay re quired to build the road. The country presents no engineering difficulties to be overcome, and we believe there are gravel beds along the route which .woul.l afford an excellent material for construction. It might be well for the state itself, au thorized if necessary by an act of assem bly this winter, to undertake this work with the inmates of the house of .orroftlon. In that institution there are hundreds of men in absolute Idleness and having their health impaired by lack of proper open-air exercise. The prison is on the line of the road and there would be no difficulty in reaching the greater part of the work on foot, returning each night to the house. The farther ends of the road could be reached by the cars, for which a small ap propriation might be necessary. If the gangs put to this work were made up of those convicts whose terms were nearing completion, there would be i:o temptation to them to escape and no harsh-iess i.eces sary to detain them, and if one should es cape the state would be well lid of a ras cal. According to this plan it would be unnecessary to come to any agreement with county commissioners or charge the counties for the labor expended. The labor unutilized in the prison is worse ilian use less to the state and It might as well be employed for the benefit of these coun ties. And in benefiting these counties the entire state would be benefited in almost equal degree. t ?> Christmas Trees for a Great City. From the Century. In a hundred places all over the city, when Christmas comes, as many open-air fairs spring suddenly into life. A kind of Gentle Feast of the Tabernacles possesses the tenement district* especially. ' Green embowered booths .stand in; rows at the curb, and the voice ef the^tln trumpet is heard in the land. T1R5 conWnon source of all the show is down the North river, In the district known ak' "the Farm." Down there Santa Claus establishes headquarters early In December a/id until past New Year. The broad quay looks then more like a clearing In a pine forest than a busy sec tion of the metropolis. The. steamers dis charge their loads of ftr trees at the piers until they stand stacked mountain high, with foothills of holly and ground ivy trail ing off toward the land side. An army train of wagons is engaged In carting them away from early morning tifl late at night; but the green forest grows, in spite of it all, until In places It shuts the shipping out of sight altogether. The air is redolent with the smell of balsam and pine. After nightfall, when the lights are burning In the busy market, and the homeward-bound crowds with baskets and heavy burdens of Christmas greens Jostle each other with good-natured banter?nobody Is ever cross down here In the holiday season?it is good to take a stroll through the Farm, If one has a spot In his heart faithful yet to the hills and the woods In spite of the latter day city. But it Is when the moonlight is upon the water and upon the dark phantom forest, when the heavy breathing of some passing steamer Is the only sound that breaks the stillness of -the night, and the watchman smokes his lonely pipe on the bulwark, that the Farm has a mood and an atmosphere all Its own, full of poetry, which some day a painter's brush will catch and hold. ? m*?''

[Mge tirent Kiri'iw of WlJirnn, Chicago Dispatch to the New York Tines. There are 111 widows of soldiers of the war of 1S1J drawing pensions of $x per month from the government pension agen cy in Chicago, and there are 17 agencies in the country. Although there are only 14 survivors of this war now living, there' are 3,287 widows of men who fought in 1H12 drawing per month from the government. "I do not want to be understood as say ing that none of these widows of 1812 is deserving of the pension she Is drawing." said Gen. Anderson, I'nited States pension agent, today, "but this war closed eighty three years ago, ami these women must have been very young and the veterans very old when they were married. "There is no question that there Is a great abuse of the pension laws by young women, who marry old soldiers for no other reason than to live on the pension money after the husbands are dead. By this sys tem of mercenary marriages the pension list of the government can be almost per petuated. There are now widows on the pension rolls, and what proportion do you suppose are old women?lifelong com panions of the veterans? You can't tell; there Is no way of finding this out, but the widows seem out of proportion to the veterans." Electric I.oeomoll vc* in Tcnnein, From til.- Detroit Journal. If the reports be true regarding the accl dent in the tunnel at Port Huron last night, in which three Grand Trunk trainmen were suffocated by coal gas, the responsibility for the disaster is plainly traceable to the negligence of the railway company. The burning of hard coal in the locomotives used in the tunnel is ?o fraught with dan ger, from the immense amount of gas gen crated. that it is said the trainmen have frequently called the matter to the atten tion of the company and asked that other methods of making steam be used. The company did rot heed the warning, and the shocking disaster of last night was the re sult. The managers of other roads running lines through tunnels have long ?go solved the problem of underground transporta tion by the introduction of locomotives driven by cleetrlclty.
