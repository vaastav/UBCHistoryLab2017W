THE ARIZONA A NATION'S DAY Hundredth Anniversary of Washington's Death A MASONIC MEMORIAL A National Demonstration of Honor in Front of the Tomb of the First in War the First in Peace and the First Forever in the Hearts of All Americans the Ceremonies at Alexandria. Alexandria, Va., Dec. 14. One hund red years ago today General George Washington, the "father of his coun try," said to his sorrowing relatives and friends, who surrounded his death bed: "I look to the event with perfect resignation." A few minutes later ths soul of the great man had passed to its last resting place. The death oc curred in the "Washington manor house at Mount Vernon, and the burial took place a few days later, the remains being placed in the family vault on the estate as was common in those days. The funeral was an impressive affair, conducted by the Masonic fraternity, to which General Washington belonged, and attended by many of the great men of the day. In observance of the centennial Ma sons of high degree from fifty lodges, including those of Nova Scotia, Quebec and New Zealand, as well as the repre sentatives of all of the grand lodges in the country, assembled in this city this morning and proceeded to Mount Vernon. The visitors proceeded from Alexandria to Mount Vernon by way of the river and on the electric car lines. The places of honor were given to the grand lodge of the state of Vir ginia, Alexandria-Washington " lodge No. 22, Fredericksburg lodge No. 4 and Federal lodge No. 1 of the District of Columbia. Old Dominion commandery K. T. did duty as escort. The memorial services at Mount Ver non were of an extremely impressive character and the programme carried out conformed as much as possible to the services on that solemn occasion one hundred years ago when the re mains of Washington were laid to rest. After forming in line on the east side of the historic mansion the visiting lodges moved in procession to the old vault, the same order being observed as on the day of Washington's funeral. Simultaneous with the start of the procession a battery of artillery boomed forth its tribute to the memory of him who was first in war. As one hundred years ago minute guns boomed from a schooner on the Potomac, in like man ner there was heard this morning the thunder of guns from a United States man-of-war anchored opposite Mount Vernon. Arriving at the old vault a solemn dirge was rendered by the band, and Right Rev. A. M. Randolph, bishop of the southern Episcopal diocese of Vir ginia, offered the invocation. Music furnished by an octet from the grand lodge of the District of Columbia pre ceded an address delivered by the grand master of Masons in Colorado. Immediately following this address, in which the grand master of Colorado paid an eloquent tribute to the mem ory of the first president, the grand masters of Masons in the thirteen or iginal states formed in line facing away from the tomb. The grand masters of other states described a semi-circle in front of them, and the grand lodge of Virginia, joining hands, formed a circle about the tomb. A touching address announcing the purpose of the assem blage was delivered by the grand chap lain of Virginia, and brief responses were made. After that the procession moved to the new tomb, in which the remains of General Washington and his wife now lie side by side. Here suitable Masonic services took place, conducted by the grand lodge of Vir ginia, assisted by the grand lodge of the District of Columbia. Wreaths and other tributes were deposited on the tomb. The tribute included a wreath of oak and evergreens from Londonsborough Park, East Yorkshire. England, sent by the Earl of Londes borough, past grand senior warden of England, and the officers of Constitu tional lodge No. 4, of Beverly, East Yorkshire. The present was the more interesting as it was sent from the im mediate vicinity of the home of John "Washington, the founder of the illus trious American family. After breaking up, the procession moved Individually to the east front of the mansion where addresses were de livered by several of the notable visit ors, the exercises being presided over by Judge R. T. W. Duke, grand master of Masons of Virginia. HE 

MEASURED THE CITY. In Which the Nation Gathered to Honor Him. Washington, Dec. 14. (Special.) -The advent of the centenary of the death of General George Washington makes interesting everything connect ed with that event, and also forcibly brings to the front the city of Alexan dria which in 1748 he, then a youth of 16, aided in surveying. There is cer tainly no more prominent and conspic uous figure in history than George Washington. In an era when sensa tional writers are ready to pick to pieces historical characters, not even sparing Washington, it may not be out of place to review briefly the worth of this eminent man. Washington's character was marked by all the strongest points'that make up the ideal man. No matter how we view it we find him always the same; calm, dignified and ready to meet and bravely deal with each emergency and problem as it was presented. We can but admire the brave boy renouncing his chosen profession to please a de voted mother. If we follow him into the wilderness with chain and compass or as he leads the hardy soldiery in de fense of home and civilization against the savage when not 20 years of age, we must pauss and wonder. His sub sequent career in the house of bur gesses and a3 a colonial soldier, to the time when in Alexandria he presided over a meeting of citizens that re solved, should Boston submit "we will not" was one proving the material of which he was made. Let us follow him to Philadelphia as a representative to the continental congress or through the dark days of the revolution he is still the same. View him assuming command under the Cambridge elm, mark his history through eight long years of trial and disaster, in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware, to the glorious consum mation at Yorktown, and we find him ever ready to perform his duty to his country. The patriot stands brightly forth at Annapolis where he surren ders his sword and proved himself the champion of human liberty. See him return for a time to what he styled "the retreat I have chosen with fond est predilection," Mount Vernon, thence presiding over the constitu tional convention. Mark him for eight years as chief magistrate and again at Mount Vernon, in each and every position from childhood to mature age, we are compelled to admire and re spect Washington. No better proof of his innate modesty and great worth can be given than the following extract taken from his farewell address after refusing a third term, thus forever fix ing the term of that office: "Though in reviewing the Incidents of my administration I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think improbable that I have commttted many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indul gence, and that after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incom petent abilities will be consigned to ob livion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest." Such is the man whose memory the people of the United States commem orate today and in whose honor the Masonic fraternity from every state and territory gathered at his tomb to repeat the services that were enacted at Mount Vernon 100 years ago. 

MASONIC PILGRIMS. Masons from nearly every jurisdic tion in the United States met to day in Alexandria and proceeded to Mount Vernon to hold commemorative exercises at the tomb of Washington, going over as nearly as possible the services cf a hundred years ago. The gathering was notable. The proposi tion to undertake the pilgrimage was upon the suggestion of the grand lodge of Colorado i:i 1S93. The grand lodge of Virginia met in Alexandria yester day in Hill's opera house. Most of the representatives from other jurisdic tions have their headquarters in Wash ington city, as it was found impossible to arrange for the accommodation of the host of visitors in Alexandria. It is not generally known that there does not exist a national lodge of this most important organization. Each state has its separate organization and controls the subordinate lodges within its own jurisdiction. Under these conditions the pilgrimage was much more difficult and the honor paid Washington much more pronounced. President McKinley attended, going by a special electric train to Mount Vernon, where he de livered an eloquent address. On his re turn he stopped in Alexandria and held a reception. The event will be long re membered by the people of Virginia who appreciate the honor paid the memory of her foremost citizen by the Masonic fraternity of the United States. Alexandria was eminently the city of Continued on Seventh Page.) A

The annual re port of the Maritime Naval company of Nicaragua has been submitted to con gress. Since the organization of the company, 19,145 shares of the capital stock have been subscribed for at par, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $1,014,500, of which amount $1.00S, 830 has been paid into the treasury in cash. Receipts from other sources make the total amount of cash received $1,164,606.51. The company has paid for property, work and material on construction of canal, $1,161,772.20 in cash; 31,990 shares of the full paid capital stock of the company, at the par value of $3,199,000; $150,000 of its first mortgage bonds, and its obligations for $6,705,000 of the said first mortgage bonds. It has also is sued 180,000 shares of its capital stock at the par value of $18,000,000 in pay ment for concessionary rights. In de scribing the present condition of the affairs of the company the report says: "In 1S95 (after the Maritime Canal company had expended over $4,000,000), and again in 1S97, and again in 1S99, the congress of the United States as serted its right to determine the line of the canal through Nicaragua and Costa Rica under the concessions from these governments to the Maritime Canal company, by enacting laws authorizing surveys and appropriating large sums of money for that purpose; and thesa laws and the operations of the com missions thus authorized have been approved by the governments of Nic aragua and Costa Rica. "This action caused an uncertainty as to the final location of the route. This uncertainty, with other causes re ferred to in the last and former re ports of the company, has made it as yet impossible to resume the work of construction." 

SAVANNAH HARBOR FRAUDS. Fourteen Indictments for Work Done Under Capt. Carter's Supervision. Savannah, Ga., Dec. 14. The steal ing of more than a million and a half dollars from the United States govern ment, in connection with the work in the Savannah river under Captain Oberlin M. Carter is to be investigated in the United States district court here. Late this afternoon the United States grand jury returned fourteen indict-' ments. Of that number only nine were put on record. The others were re tained by the district attorney who announced to the court that they could not be filed until bench warrants have been issued and served. The indictments retained are those about which the greater interest clings. They grow out of the court martial of Captain Carter, who is now i:i prison. Two of those indicted, accorJir.g to an attache of the court who assisted in the work in the grand jury room, were leading stockholders in the Atlantic Contracting company, the corporation which did all the work about Savan nah, and in which Captain Carter is alleged to have been a stockholder. It is believed that Captain Carter was also indicted. There was a report that Anson M. Bangs, a contractor in New York, would be indicted because of the prominence given in the court mar tial of his name. He appeared as the bondsman for Green and Gaynor of the contracting company, but it was de clared that his name was forged. The district attorney has given assurances that Mr. Bangs has not been indicted and that he will not be. Judge Emory Speer has said he is ready to try the cases at once. Dis patches sent out from Savannah tend ing to show that there would be whole sale indictments of local men in con nection with this case are not thought to be well founded, although the grand jury will meet again on Monday. , ARRESTED ON A TELEGRAM A Case Which Seems to Best on Nothing. A telegram was received at the sheriff's office here on Wednesday from Tucson, directing the ar rest of a man named John Stegall, and saying that Sheriff Wakefield would arrive yesterday morning with the warrant. Stegall was readily found. He had recently come to town with wagons and twelve head of horses and had taken a contract to break ground at Colonel McCord's ranch. He was taken into custody, but was not locked up. Sheriff Wakefield came in with the warrant yesterday morning. He said the charge against Stegall was grand larceny, but he did not think a case could be made against him. The com plainant is a man named Frater, at the Cienega, east of Tucson, from whom Stegall had obtained a lot of horses. The sheriff said, there were witnesses to prove that Stegall had bought the horses of Frater. The sheriff allowed Stegall to go about town unattended to look after business matters, before going to Tuc son last night. Stegall is quite well known in Arizona, and has the repu tation of being an honest man. Sheriff Wakefield spoke of the killing by him of Luis Chavez, the murderer of Sheppard, near Greaterville a week ago last Saturday night. Chavez had escaped from jail at Tucson just a week before. He had had plenty of time to get "out of the country, but had evidently got lost in the mountains. Word was brought to the sheriff's office by a Mexican boy that he had seen Chavez near Tanque Verde. The sheriff gave the boy $25, to show him the trail and when it was shown to him on Saturday morning he quickly recognized it. He followed it all day for twenty miles. He came to the place where Chavez had slept. It was a fatal sleep, for it was so long that the sheriff was enabled to come up with him just as night was falling. At a call to surrender Chavez instead of throwing up his hands threw up his gun and fell riddled with buckshot. Chavez was really a Santa -ruz county prisoner and would have been tried in that county, since the murder of Sheppard was committed near Crit tenden before the division of the coun ty. District Attorney W. P. Harlow, writing to the sheriff, thanked him for the "trial of Chavez in the moun tains." JANUARY INTEREST. Secretary Gage Will Disburse a Few Millions in Advance Payments.

Owing to the Washington me morial services held at Moun'c Vernon today the house was well nigh deserted. Cox of Tennessee, who was the ranking minority member of the banking and currency commit tee in the last congress, opened the discussion today in opposition to the currency bill. Two joint resolutions were intro duced by Williams of Mississippi, which were understood to be expressive of the democratic position on the Phil ippines question. The first declares the intention to recognize the inde pendence of the Filipinos and with draw our land and sea forces provided the independent government agrees to refund the $20,000,COO paid by the United States to Spain, to give us a suitable naval and coaling station and grant in perpetuity free access to their ports.

Americans Accused of Treacherous In tentions By Former Insurgents. Santiago de Cuba, Dec. 14. A meet ing at the Maceo club last night was largely attended by former officers and soldiers of the Cuban army. The speakers, while complimenting General Wood on his administration of affairs in this province, took occasion to make the most incendiary speeches that have been uttered since the American oc cupation. They declared that the American government was evidently making every effort diplomatically to deprive the Cubans of their promised indepen dence. They denounced President Mc- i Kinley's message as a confession of i this treacherous intention. I One speaker said that the time was near at hand when the Cubans f rom cne end of the island to the other, must unite in one vast army, inspired by Maceo's spirit, and sweep the aggres sive invaders from their shores. Gen eral Quintin Bandera, president of the club, which is a negro organization, spoke more cautiously. He counselled organization against the time when the Cubans should act, if necessary.

MEDALS OF HONOR Awarded to the Men Who Assisted Hobson.' Washington, Dec. 14. The secretary of the navy has issued an order award ing a gold medal of honor to each of the men who assisted Naval Construc tor Hobson in sinking the collier Mer rimac in the harbor of Santiago. These men are George Charatte, Daniel Mon tague, J. E. Murphy. George F. Phil lips, Francis Kelly, Randolph Clausen and Osborn Deignan. Each of these men wtill also receive a gratuity of $100 in accordance with a provision of a special act of congress. Constructor Hobson has so far gone unrewarded for his great heroism. But an effort will be made to secure him proper recognition by special legisla tion during the present session of con gress. It is possible that he will be transferred to the line of the navy or else promoted in the construction de partment. If the measure advocated by Secretary Long is his annual report to meet such cases is enacted Con structor Hobson will be awarded a medal of honor of the first class, which action carries with it an increase of pay.

Porto Rico, Hawaii and the Philippines for Agricultural and Manufactured Products of This Country. Washington, Dec. 14. (Special.) The capacity of Cuba, Porto Rico, Ha waii and the Philippines to meet our constantly growing requirements for tropical products and the markets which they can supply for our farm productions and manufactures In ex change therefor is attracting renewed attention with the reassembling of congress and the questions naturally coming before that body. The annual importations of tropical products into the United States amount on an aver age to fully $250,000,000 and are com posed of raw materials required by our manufacturers or foodstuffs demanded by the general public. The most im portant items in the fiscal year 1899 were sugar, $95,000,000; coffee, $55,000, 000; rubber, $32,000,000; fibers, $20,00,000; tropical fruits and nuts, $18,000,000; tropical gums, drugs and dye-woods, $20,000,000; tobacco and manufactures, $12,000,000; cocoa, chocolate, etc., $5,000, 000; spices, $2,500,000; cabinet woods, $2,000,000, and manufactures of cork, $1,500,000. Most of these articles are produced in greater or less degree in the islands in question and form a share in our importations from them. Sugar, coffee and tropical fruits, as is well known, are the principal produc tions of Cuba, Porto Rico and the Ha waiian islands, while these items with hemp added form the chief exports of the Philippines, hemp alone forming the largest item of our present im portations from those islands. The demands of these islands for the classes of agricultural production and manufactures produced in the United States Is also very great. In the past, Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines have drawn most of their supplies of those articles from Spain. The im portations into Porto Rico from Spain in 1S96 amounted to over $7,000,000, into Cuba from Spain in that year, $26,000, 000, and into the Philippines from Spain in the same year, nearly $1,000. 000, and all of these were either pro ductions of agriculture or manufac tures. Adding to these the supplies drawn by those islands from other Eu ropean countries, the market which they offered for agricultural products and manufactures, aside from those which they already drew from the United States was in that year over $50,000,000. In response to demands for informa tion along these lines the treasury bu reau of statistics has prepared a series of tables showing the imports into the United States from Cuba and Porto Rico, and the imports into those is lands from Spain and other European countries. In the statement of the im ports into the United States the years 1893, 1896 and 189S are separately shown, those of 1893 being under the reciprocity agreement, while those of 1S96 show the trade immediately pre ceding the war.
