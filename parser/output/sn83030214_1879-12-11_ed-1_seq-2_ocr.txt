Professor Tbomns KRlosfon delivered Tuesday night the last leclute of the Ur*t ?erles of the ntruinl course befote the New-York Academy of Sciences, at Association Hall. His aubji ct was "Gold." He de? scribed the character of the ijuattz mid the alluvial de? posits of gold, and the mineral combluallous in whieh they were commonly found. It was formerly supposed, he said, that gold was to be found on aud In the azoic and paleozoic formation* ; and when, In California. Whitney discovered It lu the )ura? slc, It was a revi la?uu. It is no a found lu tbe deposits of all ages. The rock in which it lies is generally nieta morphic, and thetvf ire n t* the surrounding* that Indi? cate ihe period. By gold we mean a yellow substance, which contains a quantity of pure gold, mixed with other substuuc.es. of wbleb silver Is almost always one. It la common to consider the ijuauttty of gold in the world to l>e large. But there is only scveu thousand millions worth, which Is nbout half pure gold and half silver. Tbe annual pn lucllon is about i. hundred million* worth, and tbe produc? tion has decreased 44 per cent itnrtne Ihe pist thirty v . urs. The produeti iu of silver, however, has iucreasod loo per cent, und now equals that of gold. One-third of the gold goes to wear and tear, one-third goes Into clr OB Mil Bat, and one third into the h'ts aud manufactures. All the obM in tbe world would make a pile only kto feat vtide. 4') Mot long and 23 teet high.
