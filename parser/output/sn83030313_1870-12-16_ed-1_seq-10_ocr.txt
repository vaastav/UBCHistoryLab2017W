Mentor Schurz'* H|??*eh on Amnesty and .IliMNOiiri FoiitlcH. The sensation hi the Senate to-<lay was the speech of senator henur/. In support of his Amnesty reso lution. There was a lar?e number of spectators in tbe galleries, and the sofas on the floor of the Sen air chamber were well Ailed with members of the lower bouse, it was expected that Schurz would be quite severe upou tlie Fresidcut, as well as upon Uh> members of the republican party In Mis souri who opposed the (iratz Brown ticket in lite late canvass. lUs references to the {'resident personally, however, were rather dlirnlfled than otherwise. The effector the speech was not bo good as It would have txjen had the Senator de livered it without the manuscript before him Scaurz M ho good an impromptu speaker that everybody was Hiirvriwd when he opened his portfolio wtth ha speech carelully written. The general opinion on both sides of the Senate ts t hat the speech was very aide, ana that it will make more or leas impression upou the public sentiment of the country. There was some amusement created b* that part of it wherein Schurz undertook to ex pose what he called "the wire-pulling tactics of the Missouri radicals." Senator Drake has the floor for to-merrow, ami It Is said his reply will be very bitter. Tue P*? Ideal'# bi?-Mt In the Revival of Commerce. Mr. John Roach, of New York, who has taken considerable Interest in the revival of American couiiueroe. had a long interview with the President yesterday. The President sent for Mr. Roach for the purpose or learning his views on the subject. The ITtwldeur will send to Congress a special mes aage recommending action at the present session to aid in reviving Ui ; shipping interests ol the country, the Many Wive* ol Utah. A lectitre on Monnonism, entitled as above, was Oellvered this evening In Lincoln Hall, by Rev. .1. P. Hewmao, D.U., Chapluln ol the United States Senate, who last summer drew his two-edged ?word from its Old Te-tainont scabbard aud jour neyed to tlie city of the Salnis, where he put brig liain Younif to flight, and slew in argument Apostle Pratt, nn polygamic representative. The lecture was a thorough discussion of the Mormon qnes tion in its social, civil and religious bear ings, showing the contradictions and absur dities on wuich it rested, its anomalous, humorous and sorrowful aspects, full or fact an <i ffitMtrntion, and abounding wtth telling hits and pungent allusions. Dr. Newman began by talcing up the Mormon lllble. Without discussing Its merits or dcjucrtiu as a revelation, he adduced fro ill its pages the condemnation ol polygamy. He then passed to the pretended revelation or poly gamy, and put the anmoval ol the latter by the disapproval of the lornier. Ho rea I the dejual of polygamy published I y Joseph Smith, when>oiieof tlie elders of tue Mormon CUurcU had been pleach ing that d??cirliie, and also read the diWual of Parley P. Pratt, la 1S4... Against these geveral denials was the testimony of Youtig to the fact that Smith received revelation in isii. If binltn told the truth then lirtgham did not. Ifbiulth did not receive toe revelation tuen Uriguam's revi; latiou was an Imposture. II Smith practised poly (rainy witnout a revelation then ho was guilty of a violation of the seventh commandment. If he hud ? revelation aud demed It, then, to use a scriptural phrase. "He was * liar and the truth was not in him." He showed the predicament In which it placed the Almighty, who Is represented as denouncing polygamy In 1S30 and justifying it in 1843. I)i. Newra.in then took up the position and relations of wo;u;iu to the system, explaining tlie Mormca Ideas of temporal and eie rnal wives And Uielr doctrine df substitution, which allows the wives an absent missionary to take a hus band by ptfiXf. He dwelt particularly on the do mestic rdgtlAns of the great prophet hunscir, and went through lirlghain's whole harem and brou^t eacn ^>f nia thirty wnes upon tho fiiag-. He showed the salvatory . economy of tji< Mormon system, and that grace aud glory in tlie next world depend on the size of a plan's family, ne explained the remarkable and ingenious provk'ons of Mormon faith, which mikes p'il vatiou retroactive through baptism and marriage for the dead. The speaker graphically related the , practical workings of the system, giving illustra tions of the aoqutcscent, ihe stoical and the terma gant women thai are found in Uiah. He ex j>osed the pretentions of llrigliam Young as ?% seer and relator and ku nyioinlnlous .failure as i prophet. Itrlgham predicted just before JLee's sunt mler that the war would iast lour years lon&er; bill (Jenerai .tfrant sasv lit to bring it to a close sooner, llrlgbum prophesied iu 18i7 that he would be Pfr.sldeni iu twelve j"ars. U!s expecta tions liad failed lilm -so far; and as for 1H72, l)r. Newman did not know who tlie democrats would choose then, but he w&s certain Hie republicans had made their choice. tApplaus .) He described and denounced Brighaui's despotism and the system which he controlled, and concluded in an eloquent peroration, declaring that such a man os Young jnust and Hiiotild t e put down, ami that Mormon - ism as a despotism must cease unuer the flag oi.onr country. It was the disgrace oi a past administra tion that tho evil was aJlowed to go un punlsed. It will be the glory ol this administration ir the Iniquity is removed Irom the face of the earih. Tins sentiment was greeted with loud applause. The audience was frequently ex cited to laughter at the doctors pointed wit, which changed to sadnois when lie depicted the crying evils of the systaiu, and found a vc'.it in applause when he predicted its eud. 4.!oovi tion o! Ed<vriiia> C'bnrflred with Fmbex Klemcnt? Kidinu of J ulge Center. m tue cat-e of C. C. Edwins, indicted for the embezzlement of $3 3r>o from toe redemption divi sion or tho .L'nlte't States Treasury in September last, the Jury to-day rendered a verdict if guilty, witn a recommendation to the mercy of the Court. The counsel gave notice or a motion lor a new trial. In answer nit the prayer or tne counsel to instruct the Jury th#c the act under which the indictment had been found liad been repealed, Chief Justice Car tier jylid;? ? To Infer that Congress Intended to repeal the] act would be to accuse thein or purpoteiy breaking d?wn tko penal barriers to the commission of crime furnished Or the act. and committing over three hiiudr-l Albion or dollars of the public treasure an nuallr to th? nanus of its financial agents nn IL, trill nod b? the fear or punishment. I'lier ln Hnded to do no such thing; thoy have done # such tiling, and the Court can icnd lta judgment to no Bitcb conclusion. 't is understood that the counsel for Kdwina will ?ryue Uw ?jnes?l?n or repeal at ienirth when the , c??o comes np before t? court Id January next. The declmou of Justice Car tier created some sur prise among l tie members of tbe bar, from the fact ttiat the question raised was not what was Intended by the passage of the act revising the Patent laws, but what had been actually done according to the expressed terras of the repealing clause. Tut' Telegraph ('able Bill? St. Domlnfo, the Alabama Claim* nn?t the New Dominion. Tbe House Committee on Foreign Affairs had be lore them to-day Mr. Wood s General Telegraph Cafile bill, which they aVe now nearly ready to report. They uLso discussed, without ooming to any conclusion, Uie St. Domingo resolution of General Banks, and those portions of the President's Message relating to the Alabama cialms .aud our relations with the Dominion of Canada. At the next meeting of the committee it Is understood that the St. Do mingo resolution will come up for special considera tion. The Senate Committee on Commerce agreed to-Oav to report Senator Chandler's resolution au thorizing the President, when In his judgment tlio public interests require It, to auapend all laws of trade and commerce with the Dominion ol Canada. Fred OouglmtH ii ud tbe Colored People'* Organ* The National Bra, started In this city several years since a* the organ of the colored people of the country, has again changed hands, and Frederick Douglass, who lias been editing it for some months past, announces in the issue ?f the paper to-day that he will hereafter be its editor and publisher. New Revenue Cutter*. Secretary Boutwell has recommended to Congress an appropriation or $300,000 for the building oi new vessels for the revenue marine service. The amount was appropriated two years ago, but some delay was occasioned in receiving proposals, necessitating a postponement of the contracts until some future time. Under the act passed at the last session of Congress that amount was conveyed Into the Trea sury as an unexpended balance, requiring a new appropriation If the work is to l>e done. The reve nue marine service requires an increase of cutters, and the recommendation of Secretary Bontwell will probably bo favorably considered. The Postal Teiexrnpli System. The Select Committee on the Postal Telegraph held a meeting to-day for the purpose of hearing an ar gument from Mr. i. ubbard, of Boston. In reply to the sj>eech of General Washburn In favor of the Postal Telegraph bill. Mr: Hubbard has a scheme of Ills own, which is for the government to build an opposition line to that of the Western Union Corn pauy. lie travelled over the Bame ground to-day that he did last winter, making the same points and coming to the same conclusion, namely? that all other schemes besides his own are unwise and Im practicable. Mr. Washburn, the chairman of the committee, will probably make a reply to Mr. Hub I bard. I Mustering Out of Army Offl ers. I The Setia'e committee on Military Affairs held a I meeting to-day, and agreed to report a bill extend ing the time for the mustering out or the army offi cers, provided for in the Dill' which passed last ses sion, from January, when it was to take effect, uutll next July. The bill was afterwards reported to the Senate. They also agreed to a bill providing for tue payment ol the interest on the money advanced by the States to the general government during the re bellion. The llevenuc Laws Relating to Sugar. There were fifteen or tweuty persons berore the Committee on Ways and Means to-day, and who are engaged as importers, dealers and refiners or sugar. Their object was to procure a modification ot the present revenue laws relating to sugar. New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Baliimore were repre sented, and the Hen. L. A. Sheldon, or Louisiana, a incmbar of the House, was present in the Interest or the sugar planters or the South. Secretary Boutwell was also in the committee room anil took part In the proceedings, which occupied at least two hours. The result of the deliberations was that the committee agreed upon and subsequently reported to the House a bill, which conies up tor consideration to-morrow, strik ing out rroin the provisions or the present law the words '-raw" and "muscovado" wherever they occur, so rar as the grades are below thirteen, Dutch standard. The effect of this will be that all sugars will now be classitled by colors alone. It appears that sugars which are muscovado, and thercrore below the grade thirteen, have been Imported in considerable quantities, when i heir real grade, judging lrom color, should be i about thirteen. Muscovado sugar, above thirteen In color, will, under the contemplated change, pay one-hair or one per cent duty more than under the law as it now exists, thereby benefiting the Louisi ana interests. Accident to Colonel Robert Donalns. Late last night Colonel Robert Douglas, private secretary to President Grant, was severely injured by being thrown from a hack. Mrs. Cutis, his grandmother, and another lady also sustained severe injuries. They were returning from the Charity Fair and the horses were frightened by the vehicle coming in contact with the step of another car riage. . ,, Nomination* Hent to the Senate.

That the splendid exhibition opened last evening at t he armory of the Heventjr-Orst regiment will t>e marked by success? that the poor orphans of the rallen heroes who helped to nave the Union will be heartily recognized as worthy creditors of the naUon-thcre can be bnt little donbt. a more meritorious object could not enlist the sympathy of the benevolent, wnile a gratcrul peo ple will rejoice in ttie opportunity of showing their patriotism in a maimer most glorious and substan tial. The fair, held under the auspices of the Grand Army of the Republic, In aid of the "Union Home and School for Soldiers' and .Sailors' orphans" promises to be one of the most interesting of the many that have recently been inaugurated. With a collection of valuable articles such as are rafely presented for sale, auction or lottery, and having A MOST COMMENDABLE AIM, there can be no hesitation lu predicting for the ex hibition a triumph tfiat will perhaps surpass the most sanguine expectations of Its charitable pro motors. It is to enlarge the dimensions of the noble institution, since the demand upon Its resources has of late increased, that the fair has been neld. The scene last evening was exceedingly eutertalnlng lor, although the arrangements were not altogether completed, the cheerfulness, beauty, elegance and bright surroundings which characterized the exhi bition were most gratifyiug. GAY AND TAST*KUL decorations, neat and tempting tables, a beautiful floral temple, attended by the most lascinating dam sels, bewitching loveliness at every turn, a splendid collection of paintings and a multitudinous variety 01 charming attractions soon captivate the visitor. At eight o clock the exhibition was fairly under way, and was inaugurated under circumstances the most auspicious. All the spacious rooms of the armory were thrown open and the music of the band rrom Governor's island sounded merrily through the building. A guard of honor, consist ing of Company K, of the Seventy -first, was in attendance, and as ^ ? OENEKAL M'CLRLLAN entered the fair he was greeted wlin enthusiastic cheers. uenerai J. i*.
