His estimates will be submitted this week and the House Committee on Agriculture will begin consideration of the agricultural appropriation bill in December. Chairman Lever, of the committee, has conferred with Secretary Houston and they will co-operate in plans the department has in view for making its work more effective for farmers. A BRITISH VIEW. Reports are coming to us through visitors to European capitals and through editorials In the foreign press, of the high esteem in which President Wilson is held by the intelligent populace of the leading European nations. The most influential newspapers are giving expression to this esteem as witness the following from The Tendon Nation: President Wilson came to the White House with a record which rather puzzled the prophets. It seemed doubtful whether this cultivated and academic personality could win the ear of Democracy which likes its rhetoric cruae. It was harder still to predlcl that a man who had spent the preater part of his career as a professor, would display either the firm will which will act, or the adroitness whltjh can achieve Its end amid the maneuvers of "bosses," the Intrigues of the lobbies and the machinations of powerful Interests The event has splendidly answered these doubts. Mr. Roosevelt had ? * * tauten, put m two terms of office he had done little else. With all his pugnacity, and his genius for suggesting that he was fighting "the battle of the Liord" and grappling with the enemlet of mankind in a continual Armageddon, he never came to close grips witt the Interests. The explanation is simple. In the first place, he was fighting for his own hand* in the second THE 

PRESBYTEEI >/ Curreri place, lie totally lacked the constructive mind in politics. His boldness exhausted itself in phrases, and deserted him in legislation. It is the quiet academic president who has achieved in a few months, with little talking and less posing, the first really considerable measures in the long and hitherto futile struggle between the consumer and thn trinstn It ronniroil an-mo ness to draft the general lines for the revised tariff. But to enact It almost without modification and with no surrender of any of its considerable reductions, was a feat of leadership and diplomacy without a parallel or precedent. If President Wilson should do nothing else, this achievement alone would suffice to make his presidency memorable. 

PEACE GREETINGS. The National Committee on the celebration of a hundred years of peace between English-speaking nations, met in Richmond, Virginia, December 3rd, uuu cuunuueu 111 session lor two aays. Prominent citizens of the United States, Great Britain and Canada participated. Numerous measures for appropriately celebrating the century of peace In 1915 were adopted. A concluding feature of the program was the adoption of greetings to the British committee as follows: "The American committee for the celebration of the hundred years of peace among Englishspeaking peoples, now assembled at a national conference in the city of Richmond, send cordial greetings to their colleagues, the British committee, and beg the Duke of Teck to convey to them and to the committee of the AngloAmerican exhibition, the assurance of our fullest co-operation in fittingly celebrating an event which shall at the same time betoken unending peace between our two nations and be a hopeful harbinger for the peace of the world. ! Resolved, That the American committee for the celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of peace among the i English-speaking peoples, now assembled at a national conference in the city of Richmond, Va., desire to express their appreciation for the valuable preliminary work that has been accom plished by the special committees In their several spheres of action.

The currency law as a Christmas present to the country was the prediction of Secretary of the Navy JosephuB Daniels in an address before the Chamber of Commerce at its banquet in the Secretary's honor at Norfolk, Va., Wednesday night, December 3rd. His optimistic prophecy was heartily received. The Secretary reviewed briefly some of the measures of the Dres ent Administration and said that they had been enthusiastically endorsed by the country in the recent elections in Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. This was rather unusual and therefore significant, as the elections generally in an off year do not often go with the party in power. The Secretary forsaw a great future for Norfolk. The logical rendezvous for national and International fleets and increasingly a port of call for coal for men-of-war when the Panama Canal is completed. He believed that as coal is gradually superseded by fuel oil as a motive power, Norfolk would become one of the greatest reservnir nnrta _ , VUV VUUUVl/ for this commodity. 

CANAL; FORTIFICATIONS. In connection with discussion of the declaration a few days ago by Charles Stuart Narine, In an address in London before the Royal United Service Institution that "despite the Hay-Paunceforte treaty, the world now is faced by a fortified Panama Canal," it was pointed out by officials interested, that while the treaty itself did not specifically give the United States the right to fortify the Canal, the correspondence which passed on the subject at the time, between the British and American negotiations, unmistakably showed that Great Britain conceded the right. As originally drawn, the treaty contained the definite statement that "no fortifications shall he erected commanding the Canal or the water adjacent." This was omitted from the final draft, however?"purposely left out," Senator Bodge declared in discussing the matter. "The omission of the proposition of fortification in the second treaty," he added, "was considered all-sufficient." The fact that the United States, under the treaty, is called upon to maintain the neutrality of the Canal In time of war, as well as In tlmo nf nn?l>o artA ** - Kw?uuu iui tuci mure, inr specific language of the treaty "that the United States shall be at liberty to maintain such a military police alone the Canal as may be necessary to protect it against lawlessness and disorder," it is claimed here m?V?t rleht to fortlfv clear. As to large fortifications with big modern guns. constituting "nollclng:." It Is argued that there can be no other proner Interpretation: "the policing" could not be done without force eoual to the task of maintaining: neutrality against any odds. "Now that the United States has become the practical sovereign of the [December 10, 1913' Canal," said Sir Edward Grey, in a communication he submitted to the American government on the Canal tolls question, "his Majesty's government does not question its title to exercise billegerent right for Its protection." He added that "it certainly was not the intention of his Majesty's government that any responsibility for the ' protection of the Canal should attach to them in the future." To date $3,-j 000,000 has been appropriated for defense of the Canal against naval attack, and $200,000 for inland defense. SOME AMERICAN WOMEN. That American women, who come to Paris, smoke cigarettes In public, attend the night restaurants, wear lavish gems and daring gowns, are largely responsible for the reputation Parisiennes have acquired for unconventlonalIty is the contention of Max Nordau in the December number of Da Revue. "When you see a woman wearing stunning hats, lunching at Pre Catalan, teaing at the Ritz, dining at Le Doyon, supping at the Abbaye and De Theleme, flirting at Deauville, gambling at Monte Carlo, drinking champagne or smok ing cigarettes, you can be sure she is a New Yorker and not a Parlsienne," he says. "The true Parlsienne is a strictly conventional woman, who shrinks from such follies." POSTAL SAVINGS. An Increase of over 113,000,000 in postal savings deposits for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913, was an nounced in the report of the board of trustees of the postal savings banks transmitted to Congress by PostmasterGeneral Burleson. On deposit June 30th, this year, was $33,818,870, against $20,237,084 in 1912. The number of depositors Increased from 243,801 to 331,006. MEXICO. Existing conditions in Mexico and the close relations which the United States sustains to that republic geographically and commercially, have attracted special attention to its civilization and resources. Discussing the Dresent situation frnm n rrwrn tnornlo! and economic standpoint, Leslie's Weekly says: "Every financial center is watching with greedy eyes for a chance to develop the untold riches of our nearest neighbor. Few realize the mineral wealth of Mexico. It is among the leading producers of silver, copper and gold, and the surface of its mineral territory hardly has been scratched. Recently Mexico has forged to the front as the third producer of petroleum in the world, last year exporting nearly 20,000,000 barrels of oil. There are those who believe that our beef problem could best b? solved by Mexico, with its limitless ranges and vast areas of grazing lands especially adapted to the raising of cattle. It is not surprising that American capital has been invested so generously in Mexico, and that the fear of our supremacy in the southern reDubllc has much to do with the anxiety other nations feel over our attitude toward affairs in that country. We fear that President Wilson does not fully realize the materialistic side of the question. Moral and ethical considerations should, of course, be considered, but we should not altogether overlook the practical side that other great nations consider. The United States is the greatesf customer of Mexico. It buys more of its products than any other nation, and it sells to it half of Mexico's Imports. This simple statement is worth considering. We should treat Mexico as a friend, a neighbor and a good customer. But she must reclpro.cate." f * -
