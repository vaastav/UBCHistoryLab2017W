COMMUNICATION- 108—GG. The people of Pleasant Township are still alive especially those near Lynn dale. The most enjoyable affair of the season took place on Thanksgiving. It happened this way Mr. and Mrs. Moses Shaw had invited quite a num ber of neighbors and friends to their tin wedding which came on 'llianks giving. On Sabbath preceding, Mrs. Sowerwine and Mrs. Sullivan persua ded them to abandon the idea of a tin wedding, on account of the pecuniary loss they had sustained, promising, to notify as many as they could of the change and entertain those who could not get the notice. As soon as then proposition was agreed to, these two ladies with the help of some others planned a surprise. A Thanksgiving service had been announced at the school house near by. The day came. The services weie conducted by Mr. and Mrs. S. T. Huntley. Then came a ailemma. Some that were notified did not come, and some that did not get the notice came -unprepared. Mesdames Sowerwine. Sullivan, Lynn and Wine gar being the only ones who brought things for the dinner. After some consultation between these four ladies it was thought they had enough for all: so with boxes, baskets, buckets ami tinware the crowd (about thirty in number) marched over to Mr. t'haw s, they having gone home some time be fore, The surprise was complete, the dinner excellent and abundant, enough dainties remaining to gladden the hearts of dear little ones that had been left at home. The afternoon was spent very pleasantly, all agreeing they had bad a good t'.ine and wishing such oc casions would come oftener. There were quite a number of presents intin v.-'irc i'd some in "hnrdpnn" WASHINGTON LETTER. (From our Regular Correspondent.) Washington. Dec. 1th. 1886, About the time this letter reaches you the two Houses of the Forty Nintu Congress will meet and open in the usual way for the short busy ses sion. The rush af Congressmen to the city, and of the crowd that always fol lows them, began yesterday, and will continue for the next month. The in dications are that there will be a pretty full representation of both Senators and Congressmen on next Monday, when the gavels fall simultaneously in both ends of the Capitol. The question which excites the most attention in the minds of the members who are coming in, is whether any thing can or will be done with the tar ill' this winter. The high-protection ists are bound that there shall be no re duction of purely protective duties, if it can be prevented. The reform lead ers are as anxious that somu deference shall be paid to the promises of the par ty to which the majority belong. One of the things which the President is credited with saying in regard to the tariff is that it should be arranged with reference to economic interests instead of political conditions, that as a party issue it is distracting, and as experience for several long and fruitless years has shown, leads to no practical results* nor even points out practical methods of reform. A Pennsylvania member-elect of the Fiftieth Congress, who has been here during the week, was talking about the surplus millions and aboutthe prob ability of the Administration being a ble to submit a plan for their reduction. IIt? thinks a great deal will depend up on what the President will say and he thinks the President has before him now the greatest opportunity of his life. "It amounts to a crime," said he, to heap up needless taxes in the Treas ury in tune of peace, and if the Presi dent takes a bold stand against it he will have the country to back him." list at this time the President is giv ing the last polishing strokes to the message with which he has been wres tling for the last few weeks. He has had a very hard time with the figures of those surplus millions, and in trying to solve the problem for reducing those taxes,—so hard a time, indeed, that he has grown nervous and irritable and explosive over tho work, to the great consternation of his obsequious atten dants. Secretary Manning's annual re port will deal almost exclusively with the surplus and the best method of re ducing the taxes, and it will be inter esting to see whether he or the Presi dent can produce the better financial matter. The report of the Postmaster Gener al was before the public more than a week ago, but the report of Secretary Endicott will not amount to anything tins year, nor will that of the Attorney General. Secretary Bayard will make no report, but will represent the State Departinentment by sending to Con gress the diplomatic dispatches of the vear. He is not discouraged, however, by the indilliercuce shown at the last session of Congress to his recommen dations. Secretary Whitney will ask for five more millions this yeai in addi tion to what has already been given for a new navy, and Secertary Lamar will reiterate his views ou the settlement of the Indian problem. lie advocates a generous policy on the part of the Government towards its wards, and at the same time recom mends such measures as will result in their becoming independent of its fos tering care. Our Indian policy, he in sists. is liased on considerations of na tional honor and philanthropy rather than of trade or self defence. Last year he said the Indians aa a raco are few, poor and harmless, and they have a just claim for help and protection which should be scrupulously respect ed. The well worn argument that it would be cheaper to keep the Indians at a fashionable hotel than as they aro now dealt with, is often revived by western people who come here. The argument is strictly true,but the troub le lies in the fact that the United States has no right to save money in that way. The Indians enjoy no priv ileges that are not theirs by right, and these cannot be taken away because the country would niaks money by the act. M.:\ Lamar's report reflects a breadth of view and fores of expression which give the document a literary value not alxrsys to bo found in stal paper. Luttyear ho wis startled by the esti mates fur pensions for thy fiscal year jus.t passed "but."' said he., "it is a tax that is cheerfully borne. Buokien Avnica f-'aiv,.
