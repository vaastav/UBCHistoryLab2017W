Articles of Incorporation were filed with the Secretary of State at Jefferson City yesterday by the Chicago, Hannibal and Springfield A Quick Trip. Correspondence ol the Ledger. Pceblo, Col., Dec. 8. I will give the readers of the Ledger a little history of the freaks of one of the many weeklies sent out Decem ber 1: - I am unable to say the exact hour on Thursday, Dec. 1, that the Ledger left the office, but suffice to say, it went to Kansas City first, railroad company. The new road is to run through the counties of ! a distance of 163 miles; then it went Marion, Ralls, Audrain, Boone, ! next to Pueblo, a distance of 630 Cooper, Moniteau, Morgan, Corn den. Hickory. Dallas. Polk and Greene, a distance of 250 miles, from Hannibal to Springfield, this State. It will run through Perry and Mexico, ntost likely yver the "old grade." At present It is not known at what point the load will cross the MissourJ river Parties interested in theline have gone over the country 4nd iave been greatly encouraged ay citizens all along the route. At "Hannibal, it is thought the C. B. & Q. will be tapped, thus giving a direct outlet to Chicago from the great South west, which for years has sorely felt the need of such a line. The incorporators of the new enterprise are R. C. Nickerson, R. D. Fowlew, E. F. House, Jas. Lathrop, R. H. Fudge and John L. Lothrop, all of Chicago. R. H. Fudge, one of the incor porators, was in the city to-day, and departed late this afternoon for Hannibal. He is enthusiastic over tee outlook and is confident of the success of the enterprise.

It is to be hoped that one of these discoveries will be a Penn sylvania writer penning the truth miles; then it went to Alamosa, Colo., a distance of 130 miles; then it lay over one day and was read by one Mr. Haley, from Thompson, Mo., and then was remanled for Pueblo and placed on my table at exactly two o'clock Sunday morn ing for breakfast, having traveled a round distance of 1053 miles with a lay-over ticket of one day for inter view.

A national conference of State live-stock commissioners is being held at Springfield, 111., to take steps to prevent the introduction of Texas fever into Northern herds. The "trust" is all-powerful. Two rubber companies of New York stood out against the Rubber Trust of that city and elsewhere, but find ing their opponent too powerful, yielded, and the rubber trade of the country, after January 1, ; will be dominated by a single organiza tion. The trust are having their day now, but the law will step in after awhile, and then the people will have theirs. The President's message notes the. growing power of monopolies under the name of trusts, and this is indicative of their dangerous tendencies. If the city can possibly afford it, we should have more light. Jef ferson street should, by all means, be lighted. The fourth and second wards should each have at least one light; "Few die and none resign," says the Indianapolis Journal, speaking of Kentucky mules. , But haven't the Republican officials of this country given the Kentucky mules a precedent ?
