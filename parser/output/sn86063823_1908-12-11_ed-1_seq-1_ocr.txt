That the committee failed to expunge its inquiries about this action from the printed hearings indicates the temper of the committee toward the execu tive. When Col. Oihas. S. Bromwell, mili tary aide to the President and Super intendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, appeared before the commit tee. Representative Burleson, of Tex as, asked if he had not requested an appropriation the last year for a watch man for the old depot. "I think so," replied Col. Bromwell, "but I have not had occasion to do it because I have torn down the railroad station." "What, torn down the railroad sta tion," exclaimed the Texas member. Bromwell explaned that he acted on a written order from the President. "Do you know of any law that au thorizes any executive officer to sell any property of the United States of that character?" inquired Chairban Tawney. No, sir," exclaimed Bromwell.
