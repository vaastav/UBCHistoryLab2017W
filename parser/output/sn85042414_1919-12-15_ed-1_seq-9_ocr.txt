SOLDIERS PROTEST AGAINST ORDERS FROM DEPARTMENT Chicago, Dec. 15.—A cominittee representing disabled soldiers from Fort Sheridan hospital today issued a public protest against the order of the chief of staff of the war ae* part.me.iU issued .November 7. which provider for the dierharginpr of all disabled soldiers in all United States government hospitals, excepting reg ular army .officers, one yoar.^after ,their adrnissiipn xcgi^rdless of condition. The protest says: "This order will cause uncurdd sol diers to be sent out into civilian- life to the -detriment of themselves and families.- It is unjust and the public should know it.. \W believe the American people, are interested in Seeing their wounded and sick sol diers as nearly well as medical treat ment can make them before discharg ing them." Captain Marco*, adjutant com mnndant of the Fort Sheridan hos pital,*1-said tjiat no soldier had been discharged from that institution un der the order. ."There is 110 !Present: danger of any soldier -being turned out of this hospital un less he wants to po and is able to Iteave," said Captain Marcus, "The purpose of the order of November 7 is cvidentfy misunderstood. It states that any patient who has been under treatment sfx months in this country may be discharged if he so desires, and any soldier under treatment a year is to be turned over to the war risk insurance bureau for further care." He said there are at present 6,200 patients at Fort Sheridan hospital and they are being discharged as .cured at the rate of 150 a week.
