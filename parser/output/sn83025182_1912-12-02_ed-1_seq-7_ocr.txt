WORKING GIRL OR A COUNTESS Andrew Carnegie Prefers the First as the Wife of His Nephew. [United Press Leased Wire Service.] NEW YORK, Dec. 2—"I would rather have my nephew marry a work ing girl than a countess," said Andrew Carnegie. He was at the St. Andrew dinner at the Waldorf when told that William C. Carnegie had married Miss Ada Belle of Pittsburgh. It was re ported here that the bride was a "poor working girl," though this was denied in Pittsburgh. "I do not know this young lady but I have every confidence in my nephew'B judgment and I am sure he has won a prize," said the Laird of Skibo. "If she is a good-girl, an American working girl will make a ibetter wife than any other girl in the world."

J. 12-82 AT NOON TODAY Third Session of the Sixty-second Congress Was Convened When the Bronze Clocks Pointed at Twelve. THE HAND OF DEATH Half Dozen Desks Draped In Crepe In the House While Senate Mourns Loss of Three of Its Members. [United PreBS Special Service.] WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—"Whack, whack, thumpety-thump." "Rat-a-tat-tat." With these gavel strokes today, re spectively, in the house and senate, exactly as the bronze clocks pointed to 12, the third session of the sixty-sec ond congress was convened. The peoples' servants were at work again, From the orack of the respective gavels, congress settled into the traces of legislative business, to end only on Manch 4 when a new presi dent and a democratic congress step In. History-old scenes were reported to day at the opening of both houses. Ancient precedents, almost law from hallowed observance, were rigorously followed. In the senate. Senator Augustus O. Bacon, large, florid and the personi fication of '"senatorial dignity," did the honors. His was the hand which lightly tapped the mart)le-topped desk of the presiding officer. Speaker Champ Clark, with vigor ous and resounding thumps of his gavel, did similar duty at the south end of the capitol. In both chambers, death lent a som ber touch to the opening ceremonies, The senate mourned in its bereave ment of Vice President Sherman and former Senator Heyfourn, of Idaho, both of whom died during the recess since last August, and Senator Ray ner. In the house, a half-dozen mahog any desks, covered with flowers, and draped with -crepe, brought a tear to the eye of many returning members Out of respect to their deceased memibers both houses adjourned with hi a very few minutes after conven ing, after transacting minor and necessary initial business. Senator Root, of New York, in a feeling eulogy, officially announced in the senate the death of Vice Pres ident Sherman, In whose absence the president pro tempore of the senate, Senator Bacon, acted as presiding of ficer. Senator Borah, of Idaho, fol lowed the New York senator with the announcement of the death of his former colleague, Senator Heyburn. Senator Smith of Maryland, an nounced the death of his colleague. Senator Rayner. Res. olutions were then passed express ing the deep sorrow of the senate, and sympathy for the bereaved families. The senate then adjourned until Tuesday. Similar recognition of their dead was made in the house. 'The house will be in order" were Speaker Clark's salutatory remarks, with a wide smile—for the Speaker. A roll call was then ordered, to ascer tain if a quorum of the house was present. Appointment of committees to noti fy the senate and President Taft that the house was in session again and ready to do business, with a faint hint to the president that the house was ready to receive any message or legis lative suggestions from him, was then the final business before the house adjourned until noon Tuesday. Ponderous machinery of the senate waB slow in getting into motion. The program of tlJfc senate did not Include appointment of the notification com mittee until tomorrow. Fixing of an hour to begin daily sessions of the senate was another point for settle ment. Two p. m. is the time favored "Every Little Oliv/B Tabletlias a Movement All Its Own'' Your doctor will tell you jiinety per cent of all sickness comes from in active bowels and liver.

Presentation of President Taft's an nual message is on tomorrow's pro gram in both houses. It is almost uniformly transmitted on the second day of every session. Opening of the impeachment trial of Judge Robert W. Archibald, of the commercp court, is also scheduled to morrow. Despite the formal, perfunctory proceedings today, spectators storm ed the capitol to witness the inaugu ration of the concluding session or this congress. The galleries, public and private, in both chambers, were jammed. A sea of feminine finery, with fluttering fans and waving plumes, made a riot of color and soft ened the more harsh tone of the rou tine business proceedings. Many foreign diplomats were In the diplomatic gallery of the senate. Wives, sisters, sweethearts and friends of the legislators crowded the private seats. Outside in the halls, fringes of spectators clustered each doorway, to hear if not to see, while hundreds of tourists and other visi tors thronged the hallways and porti cos of the capitol. The house chamber was In marked contrast to the senate in floral deco rations. Huge bouquets and sopie floral baskets filled the deBks of many representatives. In the senate, a few boutenierres, worn in senatorial lap els, were the only tinge of color. The senate has tabooed flowers at open ing sessions for several years, pass ing an iron-clad order against any such opening demonstrations or at-» tentions from friends, relatives or of fice-seekers. Strife of recent battles oiv'politlcal campaign fields lent both a humorous and a tragic angle to today's brief session. Many war-scarred veterans of a generation of campaigns lookeo upon the opening gayety for the last time. They were the ones defeated last month "In the democratic land slide. Despite their political misfortunes, the "lame ducks" laughed and joked across the aisles to their victorious opponents. This aftermath of the re cent election was more evident in the house than in the senate. Democrats and republicans mixed In little knots aud around desks of leaders in the house, slapiping each other on the back and telling their sad or joyful tales of defeat or re election. Cordial handshaking was about the limit of outward display of exuiberance in the senate. The Happy Habit—
