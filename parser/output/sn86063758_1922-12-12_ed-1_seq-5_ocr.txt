"OVERTURE"SEEN BY CLEMENCEAU N. Believes Amcrica Will Reenter European Affairs?Up to Diplomacy Washington, Dec. 8.?Georges Clemenceau closing his visit to Washington this afternoon with a "formal" address, expressed the hope that diplomacy would find the way to bring America back into European affairs through what he interpreted as an "overture" by President Harding in the annual message the execu live had read to congress a few hours earlier. "i was greatly comforted/' said the war time premier of France, "when I read in the message of your president the following lines. They are not veyy long, but they are very suggestive : " "The four power pact, which abolishes every probability of war on the Pacific, has brought a new confidence in maintained peace, and I can well believe it might be made a model for like assurances wherever in the world f any common interests are concerned.' " * > * . < > "So you see," continued the Tiger, "that even those who - are supposed to disagree, really agree at the very * bottom o-f their feeling and reasoning power. That is what I ask, and I hope this is something iike an overture, that some light will be coming, and I will be very glad if it comes from America and I hope that diplomacy will have something to say about it, and talks may. be engaged in, which, I am surer can bring nothing bat good for us all." When Clemencea'uV reference to the president's message was called to the attention of the White House, it was said that there was no comment to be made and that there was no intention of elaborating on the president's statement to congress. Clemenceau's address delivered before an audience including many diplomats, government officials and members of both houses of congress, was, in its essence the "peace message" he first delivered in Chicago. But, apparently sensing that official Washington would judge of him and bis Tniceinn few fWe cnoo^li lin -W -O^/VVUJi) llw OpO*iv deliberately and chose his words with great precision. M i The former premier answered the argument that the American taxpayer can not pay France's bill with the assertion that France could not pay those of Germany, and argued that America should help to make Germany pay. M. Clemenceau asked why the United States went to war* whether * it was to help France or to make democracy safe. If it was for the latter reason, he asked that . the United States look afar and see the barbar ism of the Turks and the anarchy of Russia. The "Tiger" bo.arded his special train shortly after 9 o'clock to go to Philadelphia, where he is sr-heduled to speak tomorrow morning. , j 

THINKS CANADA OUGHT TO HAVE SHARE OF COAL i Washington, Dec. 8.?The United States, with only $0 per cent supply' of hard coal, should treat Canada in j a "neighborly manner" and let her; have her usual pro-rata proportion of j this season's production, regardless | of resultant hardships in this coun-l try. j Such was the policy advocated by! Federal Fuel Director C. E. Spens in j a letter today to Chairman Winslow ] of the house interstate and foreign I commerce committee. He was com-j menting on pending oil's proposing; f embargoes on anthracite and bitumi-! nnns o-\-nr>r+'afir?ric if fftniiH I to protect home interests. Director Spens stated that due to I the recent strike this season's production on anthracite is only 60 per cent of normal, "but, even so,'' he added, "it would not seem to me to be proper that the exportation of anthracite to Canada should be embargoed." I Replying to Mr. Spens' views, Representative John Jacobs Rogers of Massachusetts,,author of the embargo resolutions, said: "I cannot understand the attitude of the fuel administrator. Canada does not hesitate to declare an embargo against us on the export of wood pulp when it suits her convenience to do so. cret llle-ltV of COal from Wales and we can perhaps spare her soft coal. Why, however, we should continue giving her these great quantities cf hard coal I cannot understand.*' Carry Anthrax Germs Stable flies carry anthrax germs I This is a deadly menace to your cattle!

Horrified last night by the assassination of Zan Hales and the shooting of Patrick O'Malley, Dublin was appalled today by the execution of Rory O'Connor and his comrades. Everywhere people are asking when and how it is all going to end. a i * xi. v: a special meeting 01 me caowiui 'was called last night to discuss the assassination of Hales. None of the cabinet member except Minister of Home Affairs O'Higgins appeared in the Dail, so that - body adjourned at cnce. Meanwhile President Cosgrave and the cabinet took their decision regarding drastic action - against the Republicans?deciding upon the execution of the four who were shot this morning. Rory O'Connor and his comrades learned their fate an hour later. All of them received the decision calmly i and priests were assigned to them. Their Last Hours i Liam Mellowes wrote all night,' working on a document which will soon be published. O'Connor, MacKeivey and Barrett wrote letters to! their relatives. The four Republicans were executed at 9:20 this morning and all of j them faced the firing squad calmly, j Liam Mellowes was without doubt a most patriotic Irishman, but he i lacked something which Michael Collins possessed. He was not practical and did not do much reasoning?he was purely an idealist. Rory O'Connor was probably an actor, but an actor who was responsi- j ble for heaping ruin upon Ireland.' | He was not a prominent figure when all of the leaders were standing to-, gethfer in common cause against Eng-: land. Then, however, he performed j a part and performed it bravely. He j shipped munitions from America. J traveling as a stoker week after, week. He died as he lived?a brave ; man. Captured at Four Courts "Rory mistook Mick's generosity, j , for," said Collins' sister today, dis-! cussing O'Connor's actions, "if he had acted as wisely and well as Rich- j r.rd Mulcahy he would still be alive : and honored. Those who joined the; Da Valera group mostly did so for the j notoriety." | MacKelvey was an adjutant whenj O'Connor occupied the Four Courts, j and Barrett was quartermaster. All! ' of them were taken prisoners when j they surrendered the Four Courts at ! the end of June after the long siege | ?Yy Mike Collin's troops. I In many of the Free State prison j ic,ef nio-M whpn the news ofi tai i(?/o i-iov the assassination of Hales became j known, it was all the officers and j priests could do to prevent the sol-! j diers from running amuck and at- j tacking their prisoners. j A DAY | A little hope. j A little fear. j I A little love. | A little tear. j A little work. j | A little play.
