A work of vital importance to the best interests of important cities on the Atlantic seaboard is the creation of an inside waterway or passage to the south, according to Prof. Lewis M. Iluupt, of Philadelphia, a member of the Nicaragua canal commission. This canal, he says, ivould be to the navy what a covered way is to the army, a safe and inaccessible, passage between our most populous centers, and of the most inestimable value. With a free canal open to the full extent of tho country no blockade of our coast Hue, even if possible, could materially af fect our internal commerce. 15 his message to tho general assem bly Gov.

Tho spirit of patriotism la universal and la ever la crenslnif III fervor. Tho publlo question! which now most engi oss us are lifted far above cither partisanship, prejudice or formorsOo tionul differences. They affect every part of our common country alike and permit of bo di vision on undent lines.

Indorses Special Session Legislation. Tbn extra session of this congress which (Insist during July lust, enacted important legislation, and while lis full effort has not yot been rcnli-sl, what It has already accomplished assures us of Its timelines and wisdom.

Wlthth! great rcsonrces of the government and the honorable exnmploof tho past before us wo nii.-lit not to hesitate to enter upon s currency revision which will make our demand obligations less onerous to the government and relieve our llnnnciul lutrs from ambiguity and doubt. The brief review of what was accom pli .lied from the close of tho war to 1893 makes unreasonable and groundless any distrust either of our llnanclal ubillly or soundness, while the situation from Mi to ISJ, must admonish con gress of the iuimedluto necessity of so legislat ing as to tnako thi return of tho condition then prevailing Impossible. There are many plans proposed as s remedy for the rvlL Ueforo wo ran Und tho true remedy we must apprehend the real evil It Is not that oar currency of every kind Is not good, for every dollar of It is good; g.iod because the government's pledge Is out to keep It so, and that plcd-,' wid not bj broken. However, tho guaranty of our purpos: to keep tho pledge will bo best shown by advancing toward Its fulllllment The evil of tho present system Is found In the great cost of tho government of maintaining tho parity of our different forms of money, that Is. keeplnif all of them at par ithiro.il We surely cannot be longer heed Iras of tho bunl- n this Impose upon the peo ple, even under fairly prosperous conditions, while the past four yours buvo demonstrated that It Is not only an expensive charge upon the iMverntncnt, but s dungerou monace to the nationul credit. It Is manifest that we must devise some plan to prote.t the government against bond Issues for repeated redemptions We must either curtail the opportunity for speculation, made easy by the multiplied redemptions of our de mand obligations, or increase the gold reserve for their redemption. We have tJO.OjQuuO of currency which the government by solemn en actmcnt has undertaken to keep at par with gold. Nobody is o!llrd to redoom In gold but the government. The banks aro not required to reduoin In gold. Tho government Is obliged to keep equal with gold all It outstanding cur rency and coin obligations, while It receipt ure not required to bo paid In gold. They are paid In every kind of money but gold, and the only means by which the govorntnont can with certainty get gold is by borrowing. It can got it in no other way when It most neods It. Tho government without any Used rcvenuo is pledged to mulntaln gold redemption, which It has steadily and faithfully done and which under tho authority now given it will continue to do. (demotion of Government Mots. The law which requires the government after having redeemwl lis notes to pay them out ugaln as current funds demands s constant to plenlshnenl of tho gold reserve. This Is eap ciully o In times of buslnow panic and whon tho revenues are iinuftldcnt to meat the ex p nses of tho government At such time the government has no other way to supply Its do belt and maintain redemption but through the Increase nt lis bonded debt Thus la the ad ministration of my predecessor, IWillS, lOioM'4 p.TC-.'nt bonds wore issued and sold und the proceeds used to pay tho expenses of the government In excess of the revenues and sustain the giM reserve. Wbllo It Is true that the greater purl of the proceeds of these bond were ued to supp'y dell .-lent revenue, a con siderable portion was required to maintain the gold reserve. With our revenue equal to our expense. Ihcro would be nt deficit requiring the Issu ance of bond. Uut l the gold reserve fulls below ( 1 M.4J.O.0 how will It be replenished ex cept by nel tag mare bon Is? Isthero any other way practicable undor existing law? Tho J rlou question then Is. shall we continue the policy that no b?n pursued In the put: that is. whon tho cold reservo resohes tho point of danger. Issue more bonds and aupply the needed gold, or shall we provide other means t-j pre vent ih -e recurring drains upon tb) gold re serve? If no further lo;lslation 1 had. and ths policy of sclllne; bonds Is to be continual, then congress should give the secretary of tho treas ury authority to soil bond st Ion; or short p rlods, bearing a less rati of Interest than I now aulhorlied by law. I ear nestly recommend as soon a the receipt of the government are quite sufficient to pay all the expense of the government that when any of tho United States Bote are presented for redemption la gold and are redeemed la gold, such note shall be kept and not apart, and only paid ont In exchange for gold. Thl Is an obvious duty. If the holder of the United Hates note prefer tho gold and sets it from the government he ahoald not receive back from the covemment a United Bute sole without paying goM In exchange for It The reason for thl Is mode (11 the more apparent when the government issues aa Interest-boarlna noto to provldo gold for the redemption of United State notes e non-lntsresl bssring debt Surely it should sot pay then oat again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out in any other war they may return arsis to be followed by another bond Issue to redeem them another Interest-bearing debt to redeem a eon-lntcrest bearing debt JYavtstlaa- Uold far Oaalaee. In my view It la of the utmost Importanee that tho government should be relieved from the business of providing all the gold required for exebann and export Tht responsibility I alone borne by the government wlthont say of the usual anl necessary banking powers to help Itself. Tho bank do ant feel the strain of the gold redemption. Thi wholo strata rests nnoa the govenunoat oad the aU of ths go!d reserve Is the troasj-y baa come to he, with er without reason, tbe signal of danger or of security. This osiht to bs (topped, n we era have an era of prosperity ta the country with sufficient receipts for tbe ea penaeiot tbe government we mar f ml as Ins medlat tmbarraaaaent from our pnseei ear-rwc-i tot K-o ses.rt4) exists w4 IU N ever present menacing a so long as ths existing system continue. And besides It Is la times of adequate revenues and business tranquility that the government should prepare for the worst Wo cannot avoid without serious sequence the wist consideration and prompt soiulloa of this question. aeretary UaaVa PIS a. The secretary of the treasury ha outlined s filan In great detail for the purpose of remov ng the threatened recurrence of depleted gold reserve and save us from future embar rassment o that account To thl plsa I In Vile your eareful consideration. I concur with the secretary of the treasury In his recommen dation that national banks be allowed to Issue Botes to the face value of the bond which they deposited lor circulation, and that the tax on circulating notes secured by deposit of such bonds be reduce J to one-half of one per cent per annum. I also Join him la recommending that authority be given for the establishment of national bank with a minimum capital of ta.Ooa This will enable the smaller vlllagos snd agricultural regions of the country to be aupplied with currency to meet thslr needs 1 recommend that the Issue of national bank Botes be restricted to the denomination of 110 snd upwards. If the suggestions I hare herein made shall have tbe approval of congress, then I would recommend that national banks be re quired to redeem their notes In gold, 

FOREIGN BELATIOHft. The most Important problem with which this government la now called to deal, pertain ing to Its foreign relations, eoaoern Its duty toward Spain and the Cuban Insurrection. Problem and condition more er less In com mon with those now existing have confronted this government at various times In the past Tbe story of Cuba for many years has been one of unrest! growing discontent; sn effort toward s larger enjoyment of liberty snd so If -control; of organised resistance to tbe mother eountry; of depreulon after distress and warfare, and of lnefteetusl settlement to be followed by re newed revolt For no enduring period sines the enfranchisement of tho continental posses sion of Spain In the western continent hss the condition of Cubs, or the policy of Spain to ward Cuba not caused concern to the United Slates. The War la Cuba. The present Insurrection broke out In Febru ary. IHJi. It I not my purpose at thi time te recall Its remarkable increase or to character ize Its tenacious resistance against the enor mous force massed axalnst It by Spain. The revolt and tbe effort to subdue It carried de struction to every quarter of the Island, devel oping wide proportions snd defying the effort of Spain for Its suppression. The elvtlixed code of war has been disregarded, no less so by tbe Spaniards than by the Cubans. The exist ing condition cannot but till thl government and tho American people with the gravest ap prehension. There I no desire on the part of our people to profit by the misfortunes of Spain. We have only the desire to see the Cubans prosperou nnd contented, enjoying that measuro of Rolf-control which I the In alienable right of man, protected In their right to reap the benefit of the exhaustless treasures of tholr country. Tho offer made by my predecessor In April, IHos, tendering the friendly offices of this gov ernment failed Any mediation on our part was not accepted. In brief the answer read: There Is no effectual way te pacify Cuba un less It begin with tho actual submission of the rebels to the mother." Then only could Spsln set In the promised direction of her own mo tion snd sfter her own plan. The cruel policy of concentration was Initiated February It, It Tbe productive districts controlled by tbe Spanish armies were depopulated snd tbe agricultural Inhabitants were herded In snd sbout the garrisoned towns, their land laid wasto and their dwelling destroyed. This policy of the late eablnet of Spain was justified ss s necessary measure of war snd ss s mean of rutting oft supplies from the insurgents It hss utterly tailed as s war measure. It was not civilized warfare. It wss extermination. Instruction to Oar Minister. The Instruction given to our minister to Spain before hi departure for hi post directed him to impress upon that government the sin cere wish of the United Slates to lend Its aid toward the ending of tbe war in Cubs by reach ing s peaceful snd lasting result, Just snd hon orable sllke to Spain snd to the Cuban people. These Instructions recited tbe character and duration of the contest, the widespread losses it entails, tbe burdens snd restraints It Impose upon us. with constant disturbance of national Interests snd the Injury resulting from on Indefi nite continuance of thl state of things. It wss stated that st this Juncture our government wss constrained to seriously Inquire If the time wss not ripe when Spsln, of her awn volition, moved by her own Interests snd every sentiment of humanity, ahould put s atop to this destructive war Cad make proposal of settlement honorable to herself and Just to her Cuban colony. It waa urged that ss s neighboring nation, with large Interests In Cuba, we could be required to wait only a rea sonable time for tbe mother country to establish Its authority snd restore peace snd order within the border of the Island; that we could not eontemplato sn Indefinite period for the accomplishment of thi result No solution wss proposed to which the slightest ides' of humiliation to Spain could attach, snd Indeed precise proposal were withheld to avoid em barrassment to that government All that wss asked or expected was that some safe wsy might be speedily provided snd permanent peace restored. Reply to Oar Nolo. The reply to our note wss received on the t3d day of October. It Is In the direction of s better understanding. It appreciate the friend ly purposes of this government It admits that our country Is deeply affected by the war In Cuba and that Its desire for peace are Just It declare that the present SpanUh govern ment Is bound by every consideration tos change of policy that should satisfy the United States and pacify Cuba within a reasonable time. To thi end Spain has decided to put Into effect the political reform heretofore advocat ed by the present premier, without halting for any consideration In tbe pstb which In It Judg ment leads to peace. The military operations. It Is said, will continue, but will be humane and conducted with nil regards for private rights, being accompanied by political action leading to the autonomy of Csba while gusrdlng Span ish sovereignty. This, It Is claimed, will result In Investing Cuba with a distinct personality; the Island to be governed by sn executive snd by s local council or chamber, reserving to Spain tho control of tbe foreign relations, the army and navy and Judicial administration. To accomplish thl the present government pro pose 10 modify legislation by decree, leaving the Snanlsb eorte. with the Bid of Cuban sen ator and deputies, to solve tbe economic problem and properly distribute the existing debt. Barogaltloa ft Belligerency. Recognition of the bolllgerenor of the Cuban Insurgent haa often been eaavassed as s pos sible If not Inevitable step both In regard to the previous ten yean' struggle and during the present war. I am not unmindful that the two house of eoBTrem In the spring of If)) ex pressed the opinion by concurrent resolution that a condition of publlo war existed requiring or Justifying the reoognitlon of a state of bellig erency la Cuba and during the extra assaloa the senile voted a Joint resolution of like Import, which, however, was not brought to a vote la the bouse. In th presence of these lgolBcanl expression of tho sentiment of the leglslstlve branch It behooves the executive to soberly consider the conditions under which so Impor tant s meosurj must needs rest for Justifica tion. It is to be seriously consid ered whether ths Cuban Insurrection pos sesses beyond dispute the sttrtbutes of statehood which slooe can demand the recog nition of belligerency la lis favor. Passeasloo. la short, of the essential ouallBeatloas of sov ereignty by the insurgents and the conduct of the war bv them according to the received code of war are no leas Important factors toward ths determination of the problem of belligerency than are the lnflnenee and consequences of the struggle upon the internal policy of the recog nizing stale, Taming to the practical aspoeta of a recogni tion of bel'lgereocy and reviewing Its Incon veniences aal poalttva dangers, still farther pertinent roaiUterslioaa appear. Is the code of ssttoa there I no such thing a a asked reeogaltloa of belligerency aaeeompaaled by th aasumpt on of International neutrality. Such recognition without more will not con fer npoa either party te a domestic conflict a status aot thereto! or ' actually ssinsnsssl or ef fect the relation of either party to other etatea. The act of reoognlUoa wsually takes the tons of a solemn praelassalloa af aentrality which recites ths do faoto eoadltloa of belliger ency n Its motives. It saaooaeea s oonwsUo law of aentrality la th declaring state, It se sames the mtiraatieaal obi trailoas of aa tral la thi proses s of a pupil state of was, It warns all cliisat and ethers wtthla the JurlsdlC.loa of thi proelalmaat that they vio late thosi rk.o-oaa obligation st their vwa peril and eaaaot axpM to he shielded from the soaasqueaeea, 1h right of vl-tt and Basrah sad eltnreof vessel, sad eargoaa sad eoatrabaa I of war sad goo! prtss Bade admiralty law mast tmder International lav be adatttsd as a lertumsst eoa- of a Brodsnmloa of bet- Ugereney. Whils aceOTdlag the equal eatgereat rlirtrs deaasd br pstUs law to -riy tooarnj1t.iClior4ro'3!4be ! posed ea both, whloh, while aomlaslly equal, would weigh heavily la behalf of Spain herself. Possessing a navy and eon trolling the pons of Cubs her maritime right eould be averted aot only for the military Investment of the Island, hut up to th margin of our own terri torial waters, and s condition of things would eilst for which the Cubans within tbelr owa domain eould not hope to create s parallel! while Its creation through sld or sympathy from within our domain would be even mure Impossible than now, with the additional obligations of international neutrality we would perforce sssumo. Reeogaltloa Mow Deemed Cowls. The enforcement of this enlsrgel and oner ous code of neutrality would only be influential within our own Jurisdiction by land and see snd sppllcable by our own Instrumentality. It eould Impart to the United States no Jurisdic tion between Spain snd the Insurgents. It would give the United States no right of Inter vention to enforaa the conduct of ths strife within the paramount authority of Spain ac cording to the International code of war. For these reasons I regard the recognition of th bellgeroncy of the Cuban Insurgents ss now unwise snd therefore Inadmissible. Bhould that step hereafter be deemed wise ss a meas ure of right and duty the executive will take It Intervention upon humanitarian ground has been frequently suggested snd hss not failed to receive my most anxious and earnest con sideration. But should such s step be bow taken when It I apparent that a hopeful change has supervened In the policy of Spain toward CabsF A new government has taken office la tbe mother eountry. It Is pledged In advance to the declaration that all the effort In the world cannot uf0ce to maintain peace In Cuba by tho bayonet; that vague promises of reform after subjugation afford no solution of th Insular problem; that with s substitution of commander must como s change of the past aystem of warfare for one In harmony with s new policy which hsll no longer slm to drive tbe Cuban to the "horrible alternative of taking to the thicket or uecu robing In misery ;" that reforms must be Instituted In accordance with the needs sud circumstance of tho time, snd that those reforms whtlo designed to give full autonomy to tbe colony nnd to create s virtual entity snd self-controlled administra tion, ahall yet conserve snd sfllrm the sover eignty of Spain by s Just distribution of pow er snd burden upon S basis of mutual Inter est untainted by methodsof selfish expediency. The Hear Fetor Will Tell. Not s single American citizen is now undor arrest or In confinement in Cubs, of whom this government hss sny knowledge. Tbe near future will demonstrate whether the Indis pensable condition of a righteous peace. Just alike to the Cuban snd to Spain os well aa equitable to all our Interests so Intimately In volved la the welfare of Cuba, Is likely to be attained. If not the exigency of further snd other setton by tbe United States will remain to be taken. When that time comes that octtoa will be determined In the line of indis putable right and duty. It will be faced with out miglvlngs or hesitancy In the light of the obligation thl government owe to Itself, to the; people who have con tided to It the protection of tbelr interests and honor, and to humanity. Bimetallism. Under tbe provision of the aet of congress approved March t, IW7, for the promotion of an international agreement respecting bimetal lism, I appointed on the 14th day of April. lWf, Hon. Edward O. Walcott. of Colorado: lion. Adlnl E. Stevenson. of Illinois snd Hon. Charles J. Paine, of Massachusetts, as special envoys to represent the United States. They have been diligent In their efforts to secure the concurrence and co-operation of European countries in the International settlement of ths question, but up to this time have not been able to secure sn agreement contemplated by their mission. Tho gratifying action of our great sister republic of France In Joining this country In the attempt to bring sbout sn sgree ment between tbe principal commercial nations of Europe whereby a fixed and relative value between gold and silver shall be secured, furnishes assurance that we are not alone among the larger nations of the world In realizing the international character of tb problem snd In the desire of reaching some wise and practical solution of it Tho Hrltish government ha published s resume of the steps taken Jointly by the French Embassador In London and the special envoys of tb United States with whom our ambassador st London actively co-operated la tbe presenta tion of this subject to her majesty's govern ment This will be Inid before congress Our special envoys have not made tholr final re port as further negotiations between the rep resentative of this government and the gov ernments of other countries are pending and la contemplation. They believe that doubts which have been raised in certain quarters re specting the possibility of malntalng the stabil ity of the parity between the metal and kin dred questions may yet be solved by furtbor negotiations. Mennwhllo It gives me satisfaction to state that the special envoys have already demon strated their ability and Utnesa to deal with the subject and it Is to be earnestly hoped tbat tbelr labors may result In an international agreement which will bring sbout roconltlon of both gold and silver ss money upon such term snd with such safeguards as will secure the use of both metals upon s basis which shall work no Injustice to any class of our citizens The Indian Problem. For a number of years past It has been ap parent that the conditions under which tho five civilized tribe wore established In ths Indian territory unler treaty provisions with th United States, with the rlgbt of self-government and the exclusion of nil white person from within their border, have undergone so complete a change a to render the continuance of tbe system thu Inaugurated practically im possible. The total number of the five civilized tribes, a shown by tho last census. Is U,4H, and this number has not materially Increased; while the white population I estimated al from too.uoo to 0.0u, which by permission of the Indian government has. settled In th territory. The present ares of the Indian territory contains 3. (U 1,501 seres, much of which Is very fertile land. Tbe United State eitlzens residing In the territory, most of whom hsve gone there by Invitation or with the eon sent of the tribal authorities, have msdo per msncnt homes for themselvo. Numerous town have been built in which from fsw to s.a white people now resldi Vsluablo resi dences snd business houses have been erected In many of them. Large business enterprises are carried on in which vast sums of money are employed, and yet these people, -vho have In vested their capital In the development of ths productive resources'of the eountry, are with out title to the land they occupy snd have no voice whatever In tho . govern ment either of tho nation or tribes Thousauds of tholr children, who were born In the territory are of school ago, but the doors of tho sen ml of th nations are abut against them and what education they get Is by private contribution. No provision for the protection of the life or property of these whit citizen Is made by tbe tribal government and courts The ascrelary of tbe Interior reports that loading Indiana have absorbed great tracts of land to the exclusion of tbe common people sad government by aa Indian aristocracy has been practically established, to tbe detriment of the peoole. It ha been found Impossible for ths United States to keep lis citizens nut of tbe territory snd th execu ory conditions contained in treatiua with these nation have for the most part becomo uapissible of execu tion. Uy section Id, of the aot of March, I8BJ. the president was authorized to appoint three com missioner to enter lots negotiations with th Cherokee, Choctaw. Cbiokasaw, Muskogee (or Creek) nnd Seminole nations, oommonly knows as the five civilized tribes la the Indlss terri tory. The commission met much opposition from the beginning. The Indian were very slow te act and those In control manifested s decided disinclination to meet with favor the proposi tions submitted to them. A little more tha three year after thla organization the eommte sioa effected aa agreement vita tbe Choctaw aatloa alone. The Chickasaw, however, re fused to agree to Its terms, and aa they have a eommoa interest with ths Choctaw la the land of said satloav the agreement with ths latter aatloa eou'.d kar so effect without th consent Of lb- former.

CUBAN RESOLUTION. Senator Allen Urges the Recognition of the Island's Independence. Bolder of Spanish Bonds and Owners oi Property lo Cuba the One That Pre vent Cabs' Freedom Pension Appropriation MIL Wasuixotox, Dec. 8. The first ran In congress for Cuban independence waa fired In the senste jestorilay by Senator Allen, of Nebraska, lie offered a resolution declaring it to be the aense of the senate that congress should, with all due convenient speed, acknowledge by appropriate act the po litical independence of Cu ba. Mr. Allen ssid that he had long urged the United States to recognize the independence of tbe Cuban insurgents. He would not be content wiflithe recognition of bellig erency, but would Insist upon the ac knowledgment of absolute political liberty. He was satisfied that the peo ple would not be content with the course advised by the administration. Inasmuch as the Cubans for more than two years, on many battle fields, had demonstrated their valor and love of liberty, he felt that they had earned a recognition of their political liberty and that it ought to be accorded to them without further tem porising. "If necessary," he said, "this recognition should be backed by a fleet of American vessels in Cuban waters," He expressed a belief that tbe owners of Spanish bonds in this country, Ameri can citizens holding property in Cuba, Injured or destroyed by the insurgents, and the carrying trade of the country, which might be affected by auch a atcp, had joined to prevent the recogni tion of Cuba's political independence. Mr. Allen expressed the belief that President McKlnley'a statement in his message, that the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents Is now unwise and therefore inadmissi ble, would be a great disappointment to the members of the republican party throughout the United States. The national convention of that party had declared in favor of the Independ ence of Cuba, going farther than the simple recognition of belligerency. He thought that the president was under obligstions to carry out the pledge which his party had made a pledge which had been made to To.OOO.uuu people. At the conclusion of Mr. Allen's re marks Mr. Hoar presented a resolution expressing the regret of the senate at the news of the death of Representa tive Ashley It. AVrlght, of Massachu setts, and providing for an adjourn ment as a further mark of respect. At 12:56 o'clock the resolution was adopt ed and the senate adjourned.
