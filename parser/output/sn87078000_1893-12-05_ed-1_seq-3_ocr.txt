A conference between tho joint arbitrators' committee, representing the boards of the states of New York and New .Tersey on the one band, ami the representatives of the Le high Valley strikers on the other, was be gun here yesterday afternoon in the Kngle hotel. The situation was discussed In all its phases for three hours, nt the entl of which time no definite conclusion having been reached, the conference adjourned. At I) o'clock the committee Hgain met, ami remained In session until o'clock this morning. The members refuse to talk for publication, but enough was gathered from the several members of the conference to get a good idea of what is contemplated by the joint body. The ar bitrators have a plan for the settlement of the strike, which was presented to the grievance committee. The lattertookthe ground that It would not entertain any proposition that would deny to the men the right which they claim is duo them, and it was then agreed that a third plan, in framing which both strikers and arbi trators would taken hand, should be do bated, it is believed tlmt this plan will be submitted to President Wilbur today, and the ieellng hero is that the affair is drawing to a focus, and startling develop ments may at any moment transpire among the men on strike. WlLKESHAmtK, Pa., Dec. 5. Chief Ar tbur, of the Brotherhood of Locomotive) Engineers, nntl Chief Sargennt, of the Firemen's Brotherhood, were given an en thusiastic reception nt the strikers' meet ing yesterday. Mr. Wilkinwrn called the meeting to order, and Mr. Arthur was in troduced. The chief of the engineers said he was pnrtictilnrly pleased with the con duct of the men so far. They had certainly carried themselves in a manner that must receive popular respect and approval. He hoped this line of conduct would be main tained. Mr. Sargeant followed Mr. Arthur in a two hour address. He said the present strike could have been avoided hud the Lehigh Valley railroad officials lived up to the promises made the men. Mr. Sargeant said that he would, be willing to risk his life tlmt no Brotherhood man had a hand In the White Haven disaster, which was evidently caused by incompetent em ployes. Mr, Sargeant urged the men to continue on their good behavior. The coal and iron police arrested three men In the Coxton yards last night for in terfering with non-union employees while in the discharge of their duties. The pris oners were brought to Wilksbarre and locked up. The police say they are strikers. 

HAZKLTOX, Pa., Dec. 5. The strike situ ation has assumed a new phase which was not anticipated by tho Lehigh Valley officials, and as a result tho latter are greatly embarrassed. This was a move ment on the part of the telegraph opera tors, which closed up the most important offices between Delano and Hitzelton. This includes the night dispatcher and two other officers of the company here. It is expected their ranks will be largely in creased before night. The situation is now in the strikers' favor. Most of tho men who have now quit are non-union men, and the strikers are confident they will be ablo to induce new men from filling their places, . A Point for Alnswortli. WASmtfOTON, Dec. 5.

Camden, N. J., Dec. ft. The long lift of Camden's mystetlous murders was added to by the killing of William J. Kaier, a re tired baker, at the hand et burglars. A strange combination of elroumi tances surround the case, and the police are in clined somewhat to doubt the story of the uiurdeieil man's son, William J. Itsier, Jr., who was the only eye witness to tha shooting. As a result the house ts now in the hands of the police, who guard it zealously, refusing to permit any members of the family to leave or. any nnauthorlsed per sons to enter. The son says his father wakened him at 4:80 in the morning, saying there were burglars in the houMt. Going to the top of the stairs they saw a tall man ascend ing. Finding tlmt he was discovered, he rapidly descended, nnd father and s)n fol lowed him down stairs. He went wfcpidly into the yard. , t The father went to the window and pushed ftside the curtains to look out. As ho did so three shots were fired, the third one striking Mr. Kaier in the breast, and he sank to the floor, dying almost itt instantly. There were evidently two of ths mar auders, and they quickly made their escnpe, though young Kaier gave an Im mediate alarm. Vavd's Trial Opened.

SI en Have n ltlglit to Clo When ami Where They l'leHe, and No C'ottimunlty (mould I'u n lh TlMtra on Avutiunt nf Tlielr Misfortune.'. Toprka, Kan., Dec. 5. One of the most remarkable circulars ever issued by the executive of any stats was sent out by Governor dwelling yesterday. The let ter Is jidtlressed to all boards of police commissioners in Kansas, and particu larly renders nugatory all vagrant laws. After reciting the hardships of the poor in olden times, speaking speulally of the reign of Klizabeth, and in France Just pre vious to the revolution, the govornor re views tbe present condition of affairs among the poorer classes in the country,' He scores the laws now on the statute books, which calls tbe man nut of work and penniless a "confidence man." Pppak nig ui me vagrancy laws oi ivansas.ne says: i ' "It separates men into two distiryt classes, differentiated as those who ore penniless antl those who are no, and de clares the former" criminals. Only tho bit ter are entitled to the liberty guaranteed by tlie constitution. "I have noticed in police court reports, that 'sleeping In a box car' is among the varieties of this heinous crime of beitfg poor. Some pollco judges have usurped a sovereign power not permitted lit the highest functions of the states or of the nntion and victims of Industrial condi tions have been peremptorily 'ordered to leave town.' "The right to go freely from place to place in search of employment or even in obedionco to a mere whim is part of that personal liberty guaranteed by the con stitution of the United Stntes to every human being on Amerioan soil. Even voluntary Idleness is not forbidden. If mon commit offense let them be arrested and punished, whether i or poor; but let simple poverty cense to be a crlmo. "The 'rock pile' und the 'bull pens' should never have been used In degrading the friendless antl the poor. Let these twin relics of the departed auction block era cease to disgrace tliecltios of Kansas."
