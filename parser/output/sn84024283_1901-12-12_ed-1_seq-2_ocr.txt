In granting a writ of habeas cor- pus to tne relators tne court that the case hinged on whether the ease on which the Chicago American commented had been disposed of by Judge Hanecy or was still pending. .Tudce Dunne held that tne case in question had been finally disposed of by Judge Hanecy when he gave his decision from the bench, ine iact that the clerk had not entered the order when the comment on the de cision was printed and published, therefore, does not show that the case was still pending. The act of entering the order on tne record was merely a ministerial ' act, Judgo Dunne said. Judge Dunne admitted that the ar ticles and cartoon which Judge Hanecv obiected to were clearly cal culated to intimidate and coerce the court, had the court not already ren dered its decision. Judge Dunne ad mitted that the cartoon in evidence was probably libelous and the arti cles nossiblv so. Harsh criticism. Jndire Dunne remarked, is one of the incidents and burdens of public life. I see no reason " he said, "way a judge should be offered a different remedy for attacks in the publio prints than a president, or a governor or a congressman. criticism oi a public official, if just, will do good; if unjust, will do no harm."
