On the same day it crossed over to cape Sabine, where Lieuten ant Greely nd lhe other survivors of his party were discovered. After taking on board the living and the bodies ot the dead THE BELIEF SHIPS sailed for St. Johns, where they arrived on July 17th. The were appropriately re ceived at Portsmouth, New Hamp shire, ou August 8th. One of the bodies was landed at the former place, others were put on suore ai Governors island, with ihe exception of one which "was interred in the National cem tery, were forwarded thence to tlis destination indicated by friends. The organization and conduct of this relief expedition reflects great credit upon all who contribuied to its success, in this, the last of the ttated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the congress of the United States, I cannot too peal of the pre-emption law. The enact ment of 8tHtuttrs resolving the present legal complications touching lapsed grants to railroad companies and the funding of the debt of the several Pacific railroads,' under such grafting as shall tflectualiy insure its ul'imate payment The report of ihe Utah commi?sion will be read with interest. It discloses the resul's of recent legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territory. I still be lieve that if that abominable practice can bi supprersed by law it can only be by the most radical legislation, consistent with the restraints of the constitution. I again recommend, therefore, greas assume absolute political coutrol of the territory of Utah and provide for the appointment of Commission with such governmental powers as in its judgement may justly and wisely be put into their hands. In the course of ths communica tion reference has more than once been made to the policy of this government as regards the exttniion of our foreign trade. It seems proper to declare the general principles tbat should, in my opinion, underlie our national efforts in this direc tion. The main conditions of the problem may be thus stajed, We are a people in mechanical pursuits and fertile in inven tion. We cover a vast extent of ter ritory, rich in agricultural -producte and in nearly all the raw materials, necesaary lor useef the manufacturer. We have a sys tem of productive establishments, more than sufficient to supply our own dni.uds. The wages of labor are no where else so great. The scale of living ot our artisian classes is such as tends to secure their per sonal comfort and the develop ments of those higher morals and intellectual qualities that go to the making of good citizens. Oar system of t.ix and tariff legislation is yielding a reve authoritv to orizinate bills for raisinc rev- Uounty Oourt. i enue. On the 29th day of February last I The county court met yesterday morn- transmitted to congress the first annual re- leg, all the judges being present. port of the 

CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, together wth communications from the heads of Eeveral executive departments of the government, reseciing the practical workings of the law under which the commission bad been acting. The good results therein fore showed have been more than realize-.1. The system has lully answered the expecta tions of its friends in securing competent lh, aud faithful public servants, and in prO-ind.- cut - I - . rn f leuuug me appuiaiiug uuicera ui the government from tl e pressure of per sonal importuuitv and from the labors of examining the claims and pretension of rival candidates for public employment. Tie law has bad the unqualified support of the president and of fhe head of the several departments, and the members of the commission have perfnrmtd their duties with zeal and fidelity. Their report will shortly oe submitted ana win be accom- phniid by such recommendation for eulo gizing the scope of the existing statutes as shall commend themselves to the executive and the commissioner? charged with its ad ministration in view of the general and persistent demand throughout the commer cial community for A 

NATIONAL BANKRUPT LAW. I hope that the difference of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its enact ment, may uot outlast the present sessions. The pestilence, which, for the past two years, has been raging in the countries of the east recently made its appearance in European ptrts with which we are in constant communication. The then secretary of the treasury, and nue which is in excess of the present needs Pursuance of a proclamation of the presi cf die Eovernment. Those are elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condition of the workingmeu, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeeble' condition and need. Markets are provided for that sale beyond our bor ders of the manifold fruits of our indus trial enterprises. The problem is complex, and can be solved by no single measure of inovation or reform. The countries of the American continent and the adjacent islands are for the United Stales the nat ural market of supply and demand. It is from them that we should obtain what we do not produce, or do not produce in suffi ciency , and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills and our workshops should flow, under condi tions that will equalize or favor Ihem in comparison with foreign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end; First A series of rtciprocal commer- dent, issued certain regulations restricting, and for a time prohibiting, the importa tion of rags and the importation of baggage of immigrants and of travellers arriving from the -infected q tarters, lest this course may have been without strict warrant of law. I approve the recommendation of the present secretary, that the congress

POSTAL SERVICE. It discloses thecrntifyiug fact that the loss of revenue from the reduction in the rate of letter pottage is recommended in my met sage of 18S2.and effected by the act of March 3d, 1883, has been much less than was generally anticipated. My recomen- dation of this reduction was leased upon the belief that the actual falling off m receipts from letter postage for the year immediate ly succeeding the change of rate could be $3,000,000. It has proved to be onlj 2,275.000. This is a trustworthy indica tion that the revenue will soon be restored to its lornir volume Dy the natural in crease of sealed corresnondence. I confident ly repeat, therefore, the recommendation of my last annual message, that single rate postage upon drop letters be reduced6oDe cent wherever the payment of two ceniQis now required by law. The double rate is only expected at offices where the CARRIER SYSTEM , is in operation, and it appears that at the offices where the carriers system is in oper ation, and it appears that at offices tbat the increase in tax upon local letters de frays cost not only of its own collection and delivery, but of the collection aud de livery of all other mail matter. This is an equality that ought no longer exist. I approve the recommendation of the post master general, that the unit of weight in the rating of first class matter should be one ounce instead of one-half ounce, as it is now. In view of statistics furnished by the department it may well be doubted whether the change would result in any loss of revenue. That it would greatly promote the convenience of the public is beyond dispute. The Iree delivery system has been lately applied to five cities and the total numbtr of offices in which it is cow in operation is one hundred and fifty nine.

The members indulged in the usual greetings, exchanging congratu lations on re election or condolence on the defeat. The republicans made good-natured replys to equally good-natured chaff ing of democxats on the result of the presidential contest, and there was no bit terness on either side. Promptly at noon the speaker's gavel called the house te order. After prayers the speaker directed the clerk to call the roll. The roll call dtsclosfd the presence of 222 members. The speaker appointed Mr. Eandall, and Mr. Cox. of New York, a committee to wait upon the president, in conjunction with a similar committee from the senate, and inforui him that ccngress was ready to receive any communication he be pleased to make.
