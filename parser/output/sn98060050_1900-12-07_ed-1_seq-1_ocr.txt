BRATTLED OHO : FRIDAY, DECEMBER 80, 1900. President McKlnley's paragraph on rural freo delivery In his annual message bas a very pertinent local interest. Probably this branch of the postal service has no where a better or more practical illustra tion than In our own rural delivery routes. Senator Allison, chairman of the appro priations committee of the Senate, believes that everything at this session of Congress should be made subordinate to appropria tions, reapportionment and reorganization of the army. It will be noticed that Mr. Allison places the shipping subsidy bill, the reduction of war taxes and the Isth mian canal in the list of measures that ate subsidiary. Vermont's new cigarette law, heralded as a bill which would abolish the use of the obnoxious eflluvla compounds, is really a minor affair. The manufacture of cigarettes is not prohibited, and the sale is restricted only to persons less than 21 years old. The selling or giving of cigar ettes or cigarette paper to those not of le gal age Is punishable by a fine of $50 and imprisonment of 00 days In the house of correction. The law will go into effect Jan. 1. J. X. Merriam, former treasurer of Cape Colony, in an impassioned speech Sunday, denounced the war in South Africa as "one of the blackest spots In the British annals." He said the present methods of British warfare encouraged the worst ele ments on both sides, and were bound to prove fatal to the ultimate peace of the country. The promotion of Kitchener as commander in chief in South Africa is taken to mean a more merciless warfaro than heretofore against the Boers, as the sirdar of the Soudan is known as an un relenting man of blood and iron. Gen. Theodoras S. Peck bobs up se renely as a candidate for collector of cus toms for the district of Vermont. Hon. Olln Merrill, the present collector, natu rally wishes to retain the most lucrative political berth in the state. The question to be settled Is, which man possesses the superior qualifications for tho office? In private life, which would you choose to carry on a large business? Judging from the business records of the two men The Phoenix would have no hesitancy in en dorsing the present Incumbent "It Is our opinion, moreover, that the people of Ver mont have bad all they want of the official services of Gen, Peck. The largest stock of gold coin and bull ion ever held In the United Stales Is now accumulated In tho treasury and Its branch es. The total has been rising steadily dur ing the whole of the present year, and the amount Is now $-471,108,330, or about $70, 000,000 greater than at the close of 1800. This surplus of gold is in striking con trast with tho conditions of a few years ago, when the total gold held for all pur poses fell at the close of January, 1800, to $09,003,357, and the net amount at the command of the government beyond the security for gold certificates, was only $-19,-845,508. The influx of gold Into the treas ury comes partly from the new gold from the Klondike and other mines, but Its re tention Is due to the pressure for currency which leads to the acceptance of gold cer tificates and other paper money In prefer ence to coin. TUa President' Message. The annual message of President Mc Kinley Is a very careful and extended re view of all the operations and relations, foreign and otherwise, of the government. The most important portion is that devot ed to the complications in China. A con secutive historical statement Is given of the events which led up to the final catas trophe and to the siege of the legations in Pekln which followed. The only definite recommendation made Is that a reduction be made in tho amount of the so-called war taxes levied. It is to bo inferred from the reading of the message that the Presi dent favors the ship subsidy bill, and that he hopes to see Congress take measures which will insure the construction of the Nicaragua canal. He recogulzea In a be coming spirit of gratitude the remarkably favorable circumstance under which this Nation enters upon the twentieth centuty. Economical Housekeeping. 

BREAD in 19 cases out of 20 is the basic food of man. In other words we can ALMOST live by bread alone. You want the most and the best for your money. Buy Gold Medal Flour and you secure what you are after. A barrel of it makes from 40 to 60 more loaves of nutritious bread than can be made from soft or winter wheat flours. HERE IS THE ECONOMY OF IT: "GOLD MEDAL, AMERICA'S GREATEST FLOUR." REFUSE SUBSTITUTES. . - . The temper of the man, and tho spirit in which he tries to administer the affairs of the government are indicated beyond donbt in his slmplo but earnest declaration in closing hla message: "Let us keop always In mind that the foundation of our gov ernment Is liberty; Its superstructure, peace." 100 years or Mechanical Progress The December number of Machinery contains as a notable feature, marking the end of the nineteenth century, a chronolo gical record of mechanical progress during tho past 100 years. This record presents In a compilation in as brief a form as possible all the more important events in the devel opment and application of machinery dur ing the nineteenth century. It calls to mind as nothing else could tho wonderful Inventions which have come into everyday use during this period, The record begins with the invention of the first carding ma chine In Lonell, Mass., and of tbo Jac quard loom In France, and then follows on with all the remarkable developments In the use and application of steam, the growth of facilities for transportation, the working of metals, the application of elec tricity to the purposes of dally life, and so on through all the years. In the record of the year 1808 occurs the Item, "J. D. Whitney, Brattleboro, Vt., made first in clined adjustable punching press.. Is tbonght to be the first maker of sectional dies and punches in United States." In commenting editorially on the facts presented by this record Machinery says: "It would seem scarcely possible that In another hundred years there could be so many remarkable Inventions pertaining to ordinary needs and the ordinary forces of nature. People are freed from anxiety as to tho invention of useful and needful arti cles, and it would seem that we are now to enter an era in which all forms of engineer ing construction will be attempted of a magnitude unprecedented. The work that has been done has furnished the tools, so to speak, for conducting enterprises on a vast scale, of which the work of the past ten years affords an indication." The Blame for China's Uprising. Rev. F. E. Clark of the Christian Endeavor So cletr in the Chicago Advance. Another impression of a globe-glrdler is, that in this late uprising, China was not altogether in the wrong. In fact, it would not be going very much too far to say that she is altogether in the right We all mourn the awful results of the uprising; but no one can be surprised that it has at last come. Tbo dragon's teeth of war and massacre were- sown long ago by the for eigners who went to China in the spirit of commercial greed, to push their conquests. Germany lost, two missionaries and made it a pretext to annex fo her -awn empire great sectionsof Chln& England for years has forced the detested opium plague upon an unwilling nation at the point of the bayonet. France and Belgium had ob tained great railway concessions, and had ruthlessly sent the Iron horse crashing through the cemeteries, and, consequently, through the most sacred associations of the Chinese. Russia, most menacing of all, was sweeping down from the north. She had already practically annexed Man churia. She was threatening Pekln. What people with any valor in their breasts would not have risen long ago In defence of their rights? Our Ml.ftt Governor. From the Barre Times. Since Mr. Stlckney of Ludlow got Into the office of governor he bas failed to arouse the enthusiasm that he created as a candidate for the .place. Starting out with such a rank Insult to tbo freemen of Ver mont, and especially to the National Guard, as the appointment of John Mimms as chief of staff he has achieved new noto riety by his appointments on the railroad commission and forhUh way commissioner. Not a word can be said against any one of these appointees, but they showed a ten dency on the part of the governor to shirk his responsibilities and a conceit as to his own high mightiness which is taken as a slap in the face by his onn slncerest friends. Oleomargarine Bill Postponed. When the House met yesterday an ar rangement was agreed to by which the consideration of the Grout oleomargarine bill, which was to have come up under a special order made at the last session, was postponed until today and the House pro ceeded with the consideration or the army reSrganlzatlon bill. John W. Crowell was found dying from a bullet wound near his home in Wake field, Mass., Tuesday morning. He stated that he had been murdered, and this is the belief of the authorities, but many of the people of Wakefield think he committed suicide. He bad gained notoriety through his attempts to gain an immense fortune left in England by a distant relative. JSTO, 49 SAXTOKQ IlIVEB; It Is qnlte good sleighing hereabouts.

CooledKe Falrbrother. A Very quiet wedding took place at the home of Mrs. J. M. Falrbrother Thursday, Nov. 20, at 1 o'clock, when her daughter, Miss Mabel, was married to Finest N. Cooledge. The ceremony was j-urformed in the parlor, which was tastefully deco rated with potted plants ,ud evergreens. Rev. G. F. Chapin Ot 'SaxtaaS J.Uver offi ciated. The twin sisters of the bride acted as brldemaids, Miss Martha Cooledge as maid of honor and E. Herbert Blodgett as best man. The bride was becomingly at tired In pale blue lansdowne with garnitures of white applique and gold trimming and carried white carnations. Only the Imme diate families were present. Following the ceremony a bountiful din ner was served. In tho evening Mrs. Fair brother gave a reception from 8 till 10 o'clock, at which a large number of guests were present. Mrs. Falrbrother, Mrs. Cooledge and the bride and groom received under an arch of evergreen. Mr. and Mrs. Cooledge were the recipients of many val uable and useful gifts, among which were silver and glass ware, table linen, books, pictures, a Morris chair and a sewing ma chine. They will make their home In Gralton. Among the guests from out of town were H. H. Amsden, Proctorsvllle ; Elder and Mrs. O. E. Beckwith. North Springfield and Miss Ethel V. Cooledge, juuaiow.

At the semi-annual business meetinc of the Christian Endeavor society the follow ing officers were elected: President, Mrs. Amy u. weaver; vice president, Mrs, il. M. Bemls; secretary, George E. Walker; corresponding secretary and treasurer, Mrs. u. n, waiter. Small Tonus Worked Together. One feature was verv noticeable thn hauso was rirmly bound to the Interests of the small towns. Any measure that worked to the benefit of small communi ties met with a favorable reception. Thus it was with the greatest ease that the house increased the state school tax to 10 cents greatly to the discomfiture of the larser towns. The little towns had the power and were not loath to use It. So it was that the Taylor bill for dividing the school money was received with Joy while its object was supposed to uo iu euiriuii me smuii towns. Due wnen It was really shown to work to their In jury It met with immediate dismissal. We may expect to see the other state taxes Increase from now on, for the lit tle towns have learned how they can make the richer sections come to their relief. This Is the direct fruit of our system of representation. Randolph What Vermont IVeeiU.
