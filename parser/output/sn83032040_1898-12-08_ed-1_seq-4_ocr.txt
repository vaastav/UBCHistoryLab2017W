Williams, well known in this section of the State, and now one of the Judges of the Supreme Court of this State, has always been a sensible citizen as well as an able judge. I icing asked as to his views of the resignation of Judge Gordon from the Common Pleas bench of Philadelphia, said: "I am of the opinion that lie will be John Wanamaker's candidate for the United States Senate to suc ceed M. S. Quay. This appears to be the only explanation of his un looked for resignation.'' WASHINGTON LETTER. 'From our Regular CnrrcxpoiuU'nt.) WASHINGTON, Dec. sth, 1898. President MeKinley's annual message to Congress is a thoroughly patriotic document from start to finish. There is not a word of partisanship in it. The message will not only be read with interest, but it will be carefully preserved, as it is an authentic, condensed history of the events leading to the war with Spain, of the war, and of the results of the war, so far as they are known at this time. It is in itself alone sufficient to place President McKinley in the very front ranks of American statesmen, if he had not already attained that position. It is necessarily long, but contains no platitudes, no striving after effect or bids for popular favor. It is a plain state ment of some of the most importa nt events in the country's history, made by a man whose patriotism lias been proven by trials such as few men have gone through. It ought to be read in every school house in the land and studied as a lesson in current American history, written by a maker of that history. Even the most partisan Democrats find nothing in it to object to, which is something decidedly un usual in Presidents' messages. 'I lie attendance at the opening of Congress was quite up to the average, both on the Iloor of the House and Senate and in the gal leries. Speaker Reed opened the House, his smiling face indicating a contentment that must have been envied by those Democrats who have for months past, been engaged in overthrowing him, on paper. Vice President Hobart presided over the opening of the Senate in his usual urbane and dignified manner. Among the notable Sen atorial absentees were Senators Davis, of Minn.; Frye, of Me., and Gray, of Delaware, who are de tained in Paris by their work as American Peace Commissioners, but who expect to complete the treaty of peace and start for home in a very few days, the difficult part having been accomplished when the Spanish Commissioners agreed to our terms, a week ago. No man is better authority on things Congressional than Senator Allison, Chairman of theCommitt.ee on Appropriations. His opinions carry weight because of his long experience and the correctness of his judgment in the past. He said of the session of Congress that opened to-day: "In my opinion the session will be an interesting one. and many of the debates will be of great importance.'' Of the prospect of legislation lie said : "It can be laid down as a safe rule that if any measure proposed is antagonized b\ a determined min ority, it will be withdrawn. There will be great pressure in behalf of legislation for the Niearauga canal, and if any importont measure is passed; outside of the appropria tion bills, it will be the Canal bill. That subject has been so thoroughly threshed over that it ought not to provoke much debate." Of the treaty of peace with Spain he said: "It will be ratified beyond a doubt, and exactly as it comes to us from the Peace Commission. We can not afford to stultify ourselves in the face of the world by refusing to accept the work of the Commissioners. They have been very careful and deserve the endorsement of the country. I shall be in favor of prompt action because we ought to dispose of the matter and not let it remain in a state of uncertainty. We want to settle as soon as possible our rela tions to the Philippines, and this we cannot do until the treaty is ratified." Secretary Alger's annual report is a very interesting document, embracing, as it does, a brief, but comprehensive sketch of the con duct of the Mar, with copies of all official orders relating to the army, etc. A careful study of it will re move the last vestige of foundation for most of the stories attacking the management of the War De partment. For instance, the of ficial figures of the wounded in the Santiago campaign are a complete refutation of tlie stories that the wounded were not properly cared for. There were 140 surgeons with Gen. Shafter's army. The total number of wounded was 1,431, of whom only 13 died of their wounds, a percentage as remarkable in the history of war as some of the more talked about achievements of the war. Chairman Hepburn, of the House Committee and Foreign Commerce, anticipating early action on the Nicaraugua Canal Bill, has an nounced that the Committee will grant hearings either for or against the Niearauga Canal. The agents of the Panama Canal Company, now in Washington, are prepared, it is believed, to spend a lot of money to defeat or prevent Niea rauga Canal legislation, but the friends of the Canal are also in Washington in force, including a delegation from the Chamber of Commerce of San Francisco, and they w ill work as they have never worked before, because they believe success is in sight. Senator Thurston, of Nebraska, is one of the most pronounced ex pansionists in Congress. lie said, speaking of the various objects of our taking the Philippines: "I am satisfied to trust their future to the good sense of the American people. If they become a burden rather than a blessing, the same patriotic spirit which demanded their surrender by Spain would set them up in independence or other wise dispose of tliem, without sac rificing the liberties of other peo ples and without doing discredit to the American name."

Two Pointed Questions Answered. What is the use of making a better article than your competitor if you can not get a better price for it? Ans. â€”As there is no difference in the price, so that while our profits may be smaller on a single sale they will be much greater in the aggregate. How can you get the public to know yonr make is the best? If both are brought prominently be fore the public both are certain to be tried and the public will very quickly pass judgment on them and use only the better one. This explains the large sale on Cham berlain's Cough Remedy. The people have been using it for years and have found that it can always be depended upon. They may occasionally take up with some fashionable novelty put forth with exaggerated claims, but are certain to return to the one remedy that tliey know to be reliable, and for coughs, colds and croup there is noth ing equal to Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.

CAMERON COUNTY PRESS, THUSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1898. Rich Valley. Listen for sleigh bells. Mrs. Etta Lewis, of Medix Run, has been visiting her daughter, at this place, for the past week. Miss Rose Carter visited on North Creek one day last week. Mr. Will Pye is home from Cross Fork on a visit. H. Carter was seen on our streets Saturday last. Two of our most prominent young men are quite fond of walking, so we hear, especially when it is nearing the break ot day. Miss Alda Carter attended the local institute, at Sinnamahoning, 011 Satur day. Any one wishing fine cats will do well to call on \V. C. Mr. Albert Goodwin's children have come to spend the winter with their grandparents. Mrs. Lucore is visiting in the valley, the guest of her grand-daughter, Mrs. B. Montgomery. Tmx. Pains in the chest when a person has a cold indicate a tendency toward pneumonia. A piece of flannel damp ened with Chamberlain's Pain Balm and bound onto the chest over the seat of pain will promptly leave the seat of pain and prevent the threatened attack of pneumonia. This same treatment will cure a lame back in a few hours. Sold L. Taggart. Dec. For six years our daughter was sorely afflicted with throat affection caused by Diphtheria. Two years ago we used a bottle of Armstrong's Diphtheria and Quinsy Drops, which not only gave immediate relief but was a positive cure. Her tonsils were soon back to their natural size, the first in six years. C. 11. UMBOLTEN, Optician, Emporium. It is a warm day when the gas meter gets left.
