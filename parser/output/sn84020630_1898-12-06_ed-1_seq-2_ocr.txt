The attitude of the Republican party of New Mexico has always been con sistent on the question of the admission of the territory as a state. We favored the admission of the territory when the Democratic party was united in their opposition against it. We still favor its admission, believing that there is no good and substantial reason for keeping us out of the Union as a state and be lieve that this can best be accomplished by the election of a delegate to congress who is in harmony with Republican politics and principles. Republican Platform, New Mexico, 1898. Now that congress is in session, the friends of statehood for New Mexico should redouble their efforts to secure the admission of the territory as state. blateliood tor JSew Mexico: That is the live issue in the territory today, and there will be no lull in the battle until congress passes an enabling act, a con stitution has been adopted by the peo ple and another star has been added to the field of blue in the old flag. Mr. Hoar, of Massachusetts, may be expected to do a great deal of talking during the next three months. He is ferninst the administration, and when a. man becomes a "ferninster," his case is hopeless and the country must suffer while his hat is shattered in the crown. Reports from all parts of the United States show that the apple crop the past season was very short and In many sections a complete failure. San ta Fe orchards yielded the usual crop, and there is room for hundreds more. Irrigation and sunshine insure a steady yield. The moral of present conditions is obvious. There are a lot of would-be reformers, from the currency cranks to the man who wants the government to build an air-line railroad across the continent, who should be discouraged from visit ing Washington this winter. What the country wants and needs is a business session of congress. The session must adjourn on March 4th, and the time for transacting business is short enough without attempting to upset all condi tions governing commerce, finances and prosperity. "Coin" Harvey and Chairman Jones, the managers and bosses of the Demo cratic party, are very sure that pros perity has not struck the country. Their contribution box continues in a state of lonesomeness that is distress ing. The" presidential campaign is only two years distant, and unless those monthly installment dollars come in more freely, there will be considerable distress in Democratic headquarters be fore the fun really begins. Willian T. Stead is making wonderful discoveries in Europe concerning the opinion of America and Americans held on the continent. Mr. Stead once visited Chicago and wrote a book about what he saw in that city Chi cago still occupies the lake shore. America and the Americans will prob ably survive the terrible things the gen tleman has heard said across the wa ters concerning this country. There is no grounds whatever for getting un easy over Mr. Stead's discoveries. The Kansas furmers are growing au tocratic and demand that the state leg islature abolish the three days' grace allowed the maker of a note. No won der that state went Republican at the last election. Mortgages all paid off; more money in the banks than is known what to do with, and a cinch on the rest of the country by reason of money loaned to the unfortunates of other states, Kansas will soon become the "Wall street" of North America, and then look out. According to press reports, every country in Europe Is devising means and measures to prevent all the gold In the continent sliding to the United States. Trade balances in favor of the Yankees are enormous, and there is a well defined fear abroad that prompt payment will be demanded on the first of the coming year. Perhaps, the next time the president of the United States sends a commission acress the ocean to arrange for the remonetization of sil ver the demeanor of the money kings in London, Paris, Berlin and Vienna, will not be so haughty. Adversity often drives sense into heads which never contained much before. Up to the present time no great amount of Interest has been manifested by the general public in the squabble among the Democratic members of the lower house of congress for the leader Bhlp of them inority. The matter may be of grave Importance, but the country does not so consider it. So far as the leadership of the Democratic wing of the house Is concerned and Jts possible effectB upon the presidential election of 1900, the voters are very little Inter ested: the present is about all the aver aroiro mnn can take care of, without crossing bridges two years ahead. The papers of Colorado are making a great todo over sugar beets raised in that state which averaged 16.3 per cent sugar and M.b purity, isew Mexico beets are sweeter and better than Colo rado beets, and still there is not one bit if enthusiasm over the possibilities of the growing of beets and making sugar hi the territory. Santa Fe produces the best quality of beets raised in the United States, suid ought to have a fac tory under construction right now, but she hasn't. What is the matter with the citizens of the city and county that some efforts is not being made to se cure an enterprise which will bring back to the old city the "days of before the railroad" so much lamented? The surplus in the national treasury worrying the Democrats terribly. They are afraid it will be looted by de signing Republican politicians and that all manner of evils will result to the country. Within the memory of men living the country had a Democratic administration, and then there was no surplus. Democracy and deficit have synonomous sound to this day as the result of that experiment. The Demo crats and free traders need not worry about the present surplus being wasted. Uncle Sam has plenty of places to place it without indulging In extravagances, and the money will be used to the best advantage in paying debts and improv ing the army and navy. What Uncle Sam Gains. From the following list it will be seen that the United States has made gains from Spain which compensate in some measure for the expenditure of life and treasure caused by the brief war with that country. In the first place, Puerto Rico is ceded to the United States; secondly, Cuba is being evacuated; then there is the cession to the United States of the Philippine archipelago, including the Sulu group, upon the payment of $20,000,000; the cession of an island in the Ladrone group and the renunciation of all claims for indemnity, religious lib erty in the Caroline islands is demand ed; also the liberation of all political prisoners, the restoration of past treat ies and commercial relations, the ces sion of an island in the Caroline group for a telegraphic and naval station, and last, but by no means least, the ces sion of cable station rights at other points in Spain's jurisdiction. At present Spain refuses to grant re ligious liberty in her Caroline or any other possessions, for if there is a coun try where the church and state are welded into oile homogeneous mass, it is in countries under the Spanish crown, and stated portions of the public reve nues are scrupulously set apart for the support of the dominant church. And it is just where such an oppressive com bination exists that the wheels of prog ress are stayed and the face of civ ilization is turned back in the path way of time where there is inability to learn by the light of experience and an unwillingness to improve conditions so as to increase the common intelligence, and to encourage the arts, sciences and mechanical industries. Spain has left this oppressive, stifling policy as a leg acy to the countries which have thrown off her governmental yoke, but not the yoke that bound church and state to gether. England is an example where this policy exists in its mildest form; but in the light of events the disestab lishment of state and church in England and Scotland is sure to come as it has in Ireland, thanks to the wis dom of the late Premier Gladstone. The absence of such embarrassing ties is characteristic of the most en lightened nations, and while in Great Britain it may be said to yet exist, still it is in the form rather than the sub stance, and its power is more historic than of any present actual weight. The restoration of past treaties and commercial relations have already met with an obstruction, in the refusal of Spain to revive the Cushing protocol covering a certain class of alleged pub lic offenses, and from the touchy atti tude of the Spanish government, it is evident that a revision of such treaties will take some time, and Spain will not hesitate to demand such changes as may seem advantageous to her. Then the amicable settlement in the matter of cable and naval stations will require discussion, so that is is plain the joint peace commission can not be dissolved for perhaps a month to come. The President's Message. President McKinley's annual message to congress, which .was delivered to that body yesterday, was longer than state papers coming from his hands us ually are, but the comprehensiveness of the document made Imperative a more extended review of the affairs of the nation than for a considerable time in the past. Beginning with the incidents of the Cuban rebellion and the destruction of the Maine, which caused the war with Spain, the president rapidly and clearly sketches the dramatic incidents of the war, which, only lasting 121 days, es tablished the power of the United States on the seas and convinced a skeptical world that the volunteer sol diers of this country are the equal of any other force, man for man, now known, and that the armies and navy of the country are superior in many es sential and vital respects to the trained regiments and sailors of European countries. One thing the president said In his message will meet the hearty ap proval of every man In the Union, no matter what his political belief, and that is that the nation owes to the sol diers and sailors who took part in the war, either on the field of battle or in the great detention camps, a debt of gratitude which cannot be expressed, and which can never be paid in this life. In touching upon the government and the future of the islands which have come to the United States as a result of the war, the president shows a spirit of fairness and aggressiveness which will commend him to every American. While he does not outline any definite course of action to be pursued In form ulating and preparing a government for the peoples who have lately come under the shadow of the stars and stripes, he clearly conveys the Impression that so soon as they are able to govern themselves, they will be given the op portunity, and the United States will aid In the advancement of education, religious liberty, and personal responsi bility, will endeavor to teach nations that have been oppressed for centuries, the art of taking car of themselves and of bettering their condition with out wreaking vengeance upon those more unfortunate than themselves. The objects the administration has in view, in dealing with the islands, will forever emove any reproach to the United States for freeing them from Spanish rule, no matter what disposition may be made of them in the future, The war was begun In the name of human ity, and in the manner it began will it be closed, and the direct results will be to add to the civilizing powers of national strength; the new territory which has fallen to the keeping of this country will benefit by the change. The president is plainly an expansion ist, judging from his utterances on the policy of the government, and the rec ommendations made regarding Chinese markets, and foreign relations gener ally. In relation to the latter, it is gratifying to Know mat uuring me ptim year, aside from the rupture with Spain, there has been no threatening situations diplomatically with the for eign powers. Austria seems to think she has a grievance against this coun try in the Pennsylvania coal riots, but there is nothing in that to cause any apprehension. , At the present time the United States is at peace with the world, is attending to her own business and endeavoring to honestly solve the weighty questions which have pre sented themselves as a result of the late war. Regarding the finances of the coun try, the president has not lost sight of the importance of maintaining the credit of the country at home and abroad, and gives positive assurances that every dollar of the circulating me dium will be maintained as good as that of any other country on the globe. No doubt in the free silver circles fault will be found with the message on that point, but in business and financial cen ters there will be no loss of confidence in the stability of the financial system by reason of what the president said. Coming nearer home, the president touches upon the water rights in the southwest, and urges congress to take' such measures as may be considered best to place irrigation on a basis which will be practical and of universal ben efit. Particularly is attention called to the water rights along the Rio Grande, over which there has been much con troversy between this government and that of Mexico, and it Is to be hoped that in the near future that matter will be settled in a just and satisfactory manner to all concerned. The message, viewed from any stand point, is able and noteworthy for the reason that the president has had the courage to make such recommendations as he thinks best for the country, re gardless of what may be said of it by his political opponents and critics, and he has laid the business of the country before congress In a comprehensive manner which will enable the members to grasp the requirements of the situa tion and work to some advantage and with business-like celerity.
