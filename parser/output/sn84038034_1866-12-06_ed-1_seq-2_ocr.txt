Tbc most important portions or the "Pres ident's message are before our readers, but tbej will hardly rceopnize its miltl terms as the utterances of the itumblc imlividnar who, but a few weeks since was loastinjj of his power to proclaim himself Dictator. In his introductory remarks, which we omit, he addresses the men whom he late ly denounced as a laxly hanging on the verge of the government and calling itself Congress," as 'Fi-llow-titizens of the Sen ate and House of Representatives," nor does he have a word to say in reference to Iii proposed Congress to le composed of Copperhead ami rvbels U whom his mes sage was to hav e leen sent. In the pres ence of those who have the power and the courage to imp aeli and depose him. Mr. Johnson fails to repeat his St. Luw threat to place a gnard at the door of Congress and compel the admission of the Senators and. Representatives from the reln-l States. IS j marked a change in the ' demeanor of the President toward the representatives of the people cannot fail to attract general at tention, and we trust it is n indication of the return of calmer times, when in the dis cussion of the really momentous questions of the hour we shall hare less of the logic of the bar-room and more of patriotic fer vor and purpose. Aside from this, the President seems to have learned nothing since last he address ed Congress upon the subject of reconstruc tion. He still holds that his iocket gov ernments, set up by himself in the seceded States, without shadow of authority or law, are States entitled to representation in the national legislature. Although the people have so declared, Mr. Johnson does not think guarantees should be demanded of rebels, but asks for them all the rights which, he argues, they fought unsuccessful ly for f. mr long, bloody years to dives themselves of. His reasoning may be re garded as satisfactory by thote who regard the great struggle for national life and ex istence as a mere trial of strength and skill between rival sections, but the same strong arms and earnest hearts who conquered the rebellion have already pronounced overwhelmingly against it. Our foreign relations seem to be serious ly com plicated. So interested luve the pub lic have been in matter of domestic con cern, that they given but Jittle attention to our foreign policy. It has 1kti shrewdly surmised that Mr. Johnson would welcome a Avar with France or Great Rritain, hoping that necessity would then compel the ac cep?ance of his domestic policy. There is need of great wi'sdom and tact jut now in Congress in handling the delicate questions growing out of the situation in Mexico and our claims against Great IJritain, and it is 1 . 1 . I A ? -11 1 ' 1 jiopvu wm our rcprcscniam cs wm mspiay such a temper in their treatment that, while avoiding war and its attendant horrors, the integrity of our sister Republic shall be hpeeuny eecurcu ami our national honor in all respects vindicated. Our finances arc in a condition of com. ywrative security. The.recciptä of the gov ernment are in excess of its expenditures, and the national debt is being rapidly ex tinguished. The country is prosperous, yet much of our wealth is due to the char acter of our currency. The Secretary ad vocates preparations for a return to specie payments. The reduction of taxation has bad a salutary effect, and it Is expected of Congress that it will still further decrease the burdens new airily imposed upon the business of the country. ' " Congrcs. The first few days of the session will of course be occupied by Congress in making arrangements for work, and, therefore, we Lave little to record of its doings.

Sedgwick, com manding the sub-district of the Rio Grande, Lad crossed over into Mexico with a brig ade of Federal troops and occupied Mata mqras, first telegraphed, we believe to the New York World, and then to a Chicago paper proves to have been purely can ard. There is ground for congratulation in this fact, for however decided may be the sympathy of Americans generally with the Liberal cause in Mexico, it must be apparent that the occupation of Mexican soil by United States troops cannot but have the effect to render our relations with the French Government extremely deli cate- result sincerely to lc deplored at ft time rrhen we are looking for the teaceful solution of the whole question at an early day by the voluntary withdrawal of the French troops. The report is alleg ed now to have originated from some dis patches sent by Gen. Sheridan- to t Gen. Heintzclman disapproving 'certain acts of the commander of the Rio Grande.

Instead of being a candidate for State Agent, as stated elsewhere in this paper, we learn from the Indianapolis Journal that Genera Milroy aspires to the Directorship of the Northern State Prison. We une quivocally endorse the old hero for this po sition' We had feared that Milroy and Gresham would be rival candidates for State Agent, In which case we should .not . hare known which to choose. ; - Capture orSarratt.; , WasnnsoTON, D.

I r 1 Hogs. Pork packers' are laying back and awaiting developments. At present rates they refuse to Invest In hogs; and as farmers are unwilling to" take the pricea offered, prefering to hold on, it is unlikely that much will be doa in the packing bu tines? until late. Nearly all the hoga killed so far have been done on commiss ion for parties outside of the city. Furge sonfc Mansur are nov engaged in' killing .1,000 head on commission, and up to last evening have slaughtered three thousand of that number. Some few lots have been killed at other houses on like conditions. P 

RESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President sent his message to Con gress.on Monday, the first day of tho ses sion. Wc present the most important por tions this week, but are compelled to defer his summary of the reports of the Sec retary of the Treasury, War, etc. After a few - introductory remarks, the President proceeds to discuss the quest ion of the 

RESTOUATION OF TBK STATES. In my message of the 4th of December, 1ST, Congress was informed of the meas ures which had been instituted by the Ex ecutive with a view to the gradual restora tion cf the States in which the insurrection occurred to their relations with the Gener al Government. Provisional Governors had Ix'en uppointed, Conventions called. Governors elected, Legislatures assembled, and Senatorsand Representatives chosen to the Congress of the United States; courts had lcen opened for the enforcement of laws long in abeyance; .the blockade had ljeen removed, custom houses re-established, and the Internal Revenue laws put in force in order that the people miuht con tribute to the national income. Postal op erations had lieen renewed, and eJorts were beinjr made to res'cre them to their former condition and ct'icioii?y. The States them selves had been asked to take part in the high function of amending the Constitution, and of thus sanctioning the extinction of slavery, a one of the legitimate results of our internicinc struggle. 1 lavin? progress ed thus far, the Executive Department found that it had accompliscd nearly nil that was within the scope of its constitu tional authority. One thing, however, yet remained to be done before the wc rk of restoration could be completed, and that was, the rdmission to Congress of loyal Senn tors and Representatives from the States whose rn'ople had rclcned against the lawful authority of the General Gov ernment. The question devolved on the respective Houses, which, by the Constitu tion, are made the judges of the elections, rot urns and qualifications of their own memliers, and its consideration at once en gaged the attention of Congress. In the meantime, the Executive Department no other plan having been proposed by Con cress continued in its efforts to "perfect ns far as was practicable, the restoration of the proper relations between the citizens of the respective States, the States, and the Federal Government, extending, from time to time, as the public interests seemed to require, the judicial, revenue and rostal sys tems of the country. With the advice and consent of the Senate, the necessary oflicers were appointed and appropriations made by contrress for the payment of their sala ries. The proposition to amend the Fed eral constitution so as to prevent the exist ence of slavery within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction, was ratified by the requisite numler of States, and on the 1 Sth day of December, 1?;.., it was officially declared to have become val d as part of the Constitution of the United States. All of the Slates in which the iusurrec tion had existed promptly .amended their constitutions, so as to make them conform to the great change thus effected in the or ganic laws of the land; declared null rnd void all ordinances and laws of .-ecession; repudiated air pretended debts and obliga tions created forthc revolutionary purin es of Inurrectioq, and proceeded in -gixnl faith to the enactment of measures for the protection and amelioration of the condition of the colored race. Congress, however, yet hesitated to admit any of the States to representation, and it was not until towards the close of the eighth month of the sesion that an exception was made in favor of Ten nessee, by the admission of her Senators and Representatives. EXCLCSIOS OF LOT At, SOrTIIEKX SESATOI ASP r.EPKEXTATlVES. I deem it a subject of profound regret that congress has thus far failed to admit to scats loyal representatives from the oth er States, whose inhabitants with those of Tennessee, had engaged in the rebellion. Ten States more than -one-fourth of the whole numlier remain without representa tion. The seats of ."Omemtters in the House of Representatives, and of 20 members in the Senate, are yet vacant not by their own consent, not bv the failure of election but by the refusal of congress to accept their credentials. Their admission, it is l lieved, would have accomplished much to ward the renewal and strengthening of our relations as one people, and removed seri ous cause foe discontent on the part of the inhabitants of those. States. . . It would have accorded with the great principle enunciated in the -Declaration of American Independence, that no people ought to bear the burden of taxation, and yet be denied the right of re present at "urn. It would have been in .consonance with Ihe express provisions of the constitution' that each State shall have at least one repre sentative, aad that no State without its con sent shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate. These provisions were in tended to secure to every State, and to the people of every State the right of represen tation in each House of congress, and so important was it deemed by the trainers of the constitution that the equality of the States in the Senate should be preserved, that not even by an amendment to the con stitution can any State, without its consent, be denied a voice in that branch of the na tional legislature. 

INTEGRITY OF ALT. TnE STATES. It is trie it has been assumed that the ex istence of the States was terminated bv the rebellious acts of their inhabitants, and that the Insurrection having been suppressed they were thence forward to be considered merely as conquered territories. The leg islative, executive and judicial departments of the Government have, however, with great distinctness and uniform consistency refuseiTto mnction an assumpt ion so in compatible with the nature of our republi can system. Throughout the recent legis lation of congress, the undeniaLlc fac t makes itself apparent, that the ten political com munities are nothing less than States of this Union. At the very commencement of the rebellion, each House declared with a una nimity as remarkable as it was signttiCant, that the war was not "waged on our part in any spirit ofoppression, nor for any pur pose of conquest or subjugation, nor pur pose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of those States; but to defend and mainhun the su premacy of the constitution and air laws made in pursuance thereof; and to preserve the Union with all the dignity, equality and rights of the States unimpaired; and that ns soon as these objects were accomplished, the war ought to cease. . In some instan ces. Senators were permitted ..to - continue their legislative functions, while in other instances, Representatives were elected and admitted to seals after they had formally declared their right to withdraw from the Union' and were endeavoring to ' maintain that right by force of arms. All the States whose people were in in surrection, as States were included in the apportionment of the direct tax of -'O.tKtO.-O'io annually laid upon the people of the L nited Males ry tlc act approved "tu Au ernst, 1 8 I. Congress, bv the act of March 4th, 18:?, and by the apportionment of rep resentation thereunder, also recognized their presence as States in the Union, and thev have, for iudicial purposes been divi ded into districts as States alone can be di vided. The same recognition apiears in the recent legislation iu reference to Ten nessee, which evidently rests upon the fact that the functions or the Slate were not de "stroyed by the rebellion, but merely sus pended, and that the principle is of course applicable to those States which, like Ten nessee, attempted to renounce their places in the Union. The action of the Executive Department of the Government upon this . 1 1 A. .1 5 subject lias been equany uenniie r.nu uni form, and the rmrpöse tf the war was iie cificallv stated In the proclamation issued by my predecessor on the 23d day of Sep teml)cr, 18(12. It was then solemnly pro claimed and declared that hereafter, as heretofore, the war will be prosecuted foV the oblect of prat ticallv restorlnar tia con stitional relation between the United States and each of the States and the feople there of in which States that relation iscr may be suspended or disturbed.' : J -" J The recognition of the State; by the Ju dielal Departmenfof the Government i has also becnxlcat and conclusive in all pro ceedings affectl"grhem as Stalcfcaha in the supreme, c5rcun and district courts. i t OtJALTSfcXTlcbaÖr MEMBEttäLt ' In the admission of Senators and Repre sentatives from any and all the States there can be no lust ground of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation; for this cod not happen when the constitution and laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful con gress. . Each house is made the judge of the elections, rcturr j and qualifications of its own members, and may, with the con currence of two-thirds, expel a member. When a Senator or Representative presents his certificate of election, he mry at once lc admitted or rejected; or, should there be any question as to his eligibility, his credentials may be referred to the appro priate committee. If admitted to a scat, it mu6t be, upon evidence as satisfactory to the house of which he then becomes a mem ber, that he possesses the requisite consti tutional and legal qualifications. If refus ed admission as a member for want of due allegiance to the Government, and returned to his constituents, they are admonished that none but arsons loyal to the United States will be allowed a voice in the "legis lative councils of the nation, and the polit ical powcr'nnd moral inlluence of congress are thus effectively exerted in the interests of loyalty to the Government and fidelit' to the Ua'nn. Upon this question, so vital ly affecting the restoration of the Union and the permanency of our present form of gov ernment, my convictions heretofore ex pressed, have undergone no c hange; but on the contrary, their correctness has been confirmed by reflection and time. If the admission of loyal members to their seats in the respective houses of congress was wise and expedient a year a;o, it is no less wise and expedient now. if this anoma lous condition is right now: if in the exact position of these States at the present tii le it is lawful to exclude them from represen tation, I do not see that the question will be changed by the influence of time. Ten years hence, if these States remain as they are, the right of representation will le no stronger; the right of exclusion will be no weaker. 

ADVANTAGE OF AOMITTIXO LOY A I. SOCTIIEUN MEMBERS. " The Constitution of the United States makes it the duty of the President to re commend to the consideration of Congress such measures as he shall judge necessary or espedient. 1 know of no measure more imperatively demanded by every considera tion of national Interest, sound "policy and equal justice, than the admission of the loy al members from the now unrepresented States. This would consummate the work of restoration, and exert a most salutary in fluence in the establishment of peace, har mony and fraternal feeling. It ould tend great Iv to renew the coufidence of the American people in the vigor and btability of their institutions. It would bind us more closely together as a nation, and enable us to show the world the inherent and recu perative power of a government founded upon the will ol the ieopIe. and establish ed upon the principles of liberty, justice and intelligence. Our increased strength and enhanced prosperity would irrefrag.ihly demonstrate the fallacy of the arguments against free institutions, drawn from our recent national disorders, by the enemies of republican government. The admission of loyal members from the States now ex cluded from Congress, by allaying doubt and apprehension, would turn capital now awaiting an opportunity fr investment in to the channels of trade and industry. It would alleviate the present troubled condi tion of those States, and by inducing Iimiii grants, ai l in the settlement of fertile re gions now uncultivated, audited to an in creased pro 1'ietion of those staples which have added so nmch to the wealth of the nation, and the commerce of the world. New fields of enterprise would Ik opened to our progressive pecple. and soon the de vastations of war would be rcjwired. und all traces of our domestic ditliculties effaced from the minds of our countrymen. In our effirts to preserve "the ULity of government which constitutes us one peo ple, by restoring the Stutes to the condition which they held prior to the rebellion, we should lie cautious lest, having rescued our nation from ci i!s of threatened disintegra tion, we resort to consolidation, and in the end absolute despotism, s a remedy fcrthe recurrence of similar troubles. The war having terminated, and with it all occasion for the exercise of powers of doubtful constitutionality, wc should has ten to bring legislation within the bounda ries prfscrilK'd by the Constitution, and to return to the ancient landmarks established by our fathers for the guidance of future generations. The t onsiitution which at any time exist.-, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory ujon all. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it Ik? correct ed by an amendment, in the way in which the Constitution designates: but let there Ik no change bv usurpation, fur it is the cus tomary weapon bv which free governments are destroyed." Washington spoke these words to his countrymen when, lolioweu by their love and gratitude, he voluntarily retired from the cares or public lite, "in keep in all things within the pale of our constitutional powers, and cherish the Fed eral union as the only rock of safety," were prescribed by Jefferson as rules of action to endear to his countrymen the true prin ciples of their Constitution and promote a Lmon of sentime nt and action equally aus picious to their happiness and safety. Jack son said "that the action of the 'General Government should always be strictly con fined to the sphere of its appropriate du ties," and justly and forcibly urged, 'that our Government is not to be maintain ?d nor our Union preserved by invasions of the rights and powers of the several States. In thus attempting to make our General Government strong we make it weak. Its true strength consists in leaving ieuividu- als and States as much as possible lo the n- selves. In making itselr felt, not in its power, but in its leneficc nee; not in binding the States more closely to the centre, but leaving each to move unobstructed in its proper constitutional orbit." These are the teachings of men whose deeds and services have made them illus trious, and who, Jong since withdrawn from the scenes of life, have left to their country the rich legacy of their council, their wis dom, and their patriotism. Drawing fresh inspirations from their lessons, let us emu late them in love of country and respect for the Constitution and laws. - THE MEXtCAX. QfESTlOX. - In the month of April last, as Congress is aware, a friendly arrangement was made between the Emperor of the French and the President of the United States, for with drawal from Mexico of the Frenc h expedi tionary military forces. The withdrawal was to be made in three detac hments, the first of which it was understood would leave Mexico in "November now past; the second in March next, and the third and last in November, 18ß7. Immediately up on the completion of the evacuation, the French Government wai to assume the same attitude of non-intervention in regard to Mexico as Is held bv the Government of the United States. Repeated assurances have been given by the Emperor since that agreement that be would complete the promised evacuation within the period mentioned or sooner. It was reasonably expected that the prcccedings thus con templated would produce a crisis of great political interest In the Republic of Mexico. The newly appointed Minister of the Uni ted States, Mr. Ccmplcll, was, therefore, sent forward on the ninth day of Novcm tcr last to assume his proicr functions as Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States to that Republic. It was also thought expedient that he should be attend ed in the vic inity ot Mexico by the Lieu tenant General of the army of the United States, with a view of obtaining such in formation as might .be important to det er mine the course to be pursued by tho Uni ted States in re-establishing and maintain ing necessary .and, proper intercourse, with the Republic- of Mexico-. 'Deeply 'inter ested in the cause of liberty and humanity, 'it seemed n obvious duty on our part to 'eiereise whatever inlluence we possessed for the restoration v and permuient estab lishment in that country of a domestic and republican form of Government. '' Such was the condition of affdrs in re? gard to Mexhoo, when, pn the . 23d or No vember last.1 DlBcial information 'was-re ceived from Paris that the Emperor of France had, some time before, decided not to withdraw a detachment ot ntaiorcei in the jnontli of November past, according to engagement," but that thte decisioa was made w ith the purpose of withdrawing the whole of those forces in the ensuing spring. Of this determination, however, the United States had not received any notice or inti mation, and as soon as the Information was received by the Government, care was taken to make known its dissent to the course of the Emperor of France. I cannot forego the hope that France will reconsider the sub ject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the cvnf uution of Mexico, which will conform as nearly as practicable with the existing engagement, and thus meet the just expectations of the United States. The papers relating to the subject will be laid before you. it is believed that with the evacuation of Mexico by the expedi tionary forces, no subject for serious differ ences between France and the United States would remain. The expressions of the Emperor and people of France warrant a hope that the traditionary friendship be tween" the two countries might, in that case, be renewed and peraiantlv restored. A claim of a citizen of the United States for indemnity for spoliations committed on tiie high seas by the French "authorities, in the exercise of a belligerent power against Mexico, has been met by the Government of France with a proposition to defer set tlement until a mutual convention for the adjustment of all cbiims of citizens and subjects of loth countries, arising out of the recent wars on this Continent, shall le agreed upon by the two countries. The suggestion is not deemed unreasonable, but it belongs to Congress to direct the manner in which claims for indemnity by foreign ers, as well as citizens of the United States, arising out of the late civil.war, shall be ad judicated and determined. Ihavc no doubt that the subject of all such claims will en gage your attention at a convenient at.d proper time. oi:k t nniTATX? It is a matter of great regret that no con siderable advance has been, made towards an adjustment of the difterences between the United" States and Great Britain, ari sing out of the depredations on our nation al commerce, ana other trespasses, com mitted during our civil war, by llritish subjects, in violation of international law ami treaty obligations. The delay, how ever, may be believed to have resulted, in no small degree, fr m the domestic situa tion of (Jreut Hiitian. An. entire change of ministry occurred In that country during the last session of Parliament. The atten tion of the new ministry vis called to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason to expect that it will now be consid ered in a bec oming and friendly spirit. The importance of an early disposition of the question cannot be exaggerated. Whatever might 1 the wishes of the two Governments'" it is manifest that good will and friendship between the two countries cannot le established until a reciprocity in the practice of gwxl faith and neutrality shall be restored between the respective na tions.
