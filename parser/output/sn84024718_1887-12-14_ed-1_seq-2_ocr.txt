Mr. Blame's friends controlled the proceedings of the national republican committee. It is thought that his nomination for the presi dency is assured, and that Cleveland and Blame will again make the race in 1888. Crushed to death by a loo.—On Tues day, the 6th inst., whilst Mr. John M. Rey nolds, of Union, Monroe Co., W.

A HORBE-THIBF CAPTOBJ-D IN LEXING TON. —A young man who arrived in Lex ington on Monday night of last week and registered at the hotel as "C. E. Carmany, Harrisonburg," was arrested thereon the charge of having stolen at Hagerstown, Md , on the Saturday night before, the horse and buggy he had with him. The Hagerstown authorities will take him to that place for trial. Hon. John S. Barbour nominated bt acclamation.—On last Thursday night, the caucus of the Democratic members of the Legislature nominated by acclamation Hon. John S. Barbour for U. S. Senator to suoceed Senator Riddleberger, and, on the JOth, he will bo elected by the unanimous vote of tne Democratic members. The Republicaus have not yet made a nomination, but they will, no doubt, nomi nate Mahone, though miuy are opposed to him. Charged with Forgery.—T. A.

Fatal Railroad Collision at Coving ton. —A special dispatch to the Charleston (W. Va.) Star says that, at Covington, Al leghany county, Va., on last Sunday morn ing, two freight trains collided, wrecking about twenty cars and killing three men.— The front eection stopped for water and the rear section ran into the forward train. — The names of those killed are, Mr. Fry, conductor,whose home was in Hagerstowm Maryland. Mr. Lynch, brakeman, of White Sulphur Springs, and Fireman Mer rimaa. The engineer escaped by jumping from the train. Abolition op the intebnal revenue tax—Those who are demanding that the icholc internal revenue tax should be i_v mediately and at once abolished—that on whiskey as well as that on tobacco and fruit spirits—seem to overlook the fact tbat the annual revenues teen from the only source left—that of the tariff or customs duties—would not equal the annual ex penses of the government. It would be better to leave the tax on whiskey, which is not only a luxury, but the source of much evil, and take a portion of the tax off the necessaries of life by reducing the tariff on such neoessaries. This would fnrnish relief to the poor whose necessaries are now taxed too high. ♦ „ , Transportation Kates. In the last canvass there was considerable discussion iv relation to transportation charges on tbe railroads, and it was assert. Ed that they were not regulated at equi table rates, and that the Inter-State Com merce law passed by Congress did not secuie the ends it was intended .to accom plish in these respects. Most of tbe caud', dates and speakers who entertained these views maintained that it was incumbeut on tbe Legislature to review the question, and pass sucb laws as would ensure rates of charges on the railroads upon a different basis than the one governing what was known as long- and short-hau 8. The rail, roads and the commercial progress and the prosperity of the agricultural interests of the country should not b- at variance, nor should the railroads seek to make their local traffic bear more than fair charges for moving it; but it is charged tbat the policy generally pursued is the reverse. Senator Koiner has introduced a resolu tion in the Senate which will bring this whole questiou up, and it is hoped that the investigation by the committee will bring this subject before the Legislature in all its true relations, and that laws will be en. acted settling the difficulty on just princi pies. This controversy ought to aod, and Senator Koiner hss ma~_ an early mow men: to investigate it with that view. The people desire it, and the Legislature is the prep authority to do it. j, ■The Governor's Message, st regular message of Governor ired of him for presenting to the Legislature the "condition of the Com monwealth," was communicated to that body at its first regular session, which commenced under his administration, on the 7th instant, and will be found in its entirety in this issue of the Spectator. In all the history of Virginia, which has been distinguished for the ability of her Chief Executive officers as well as for her grand renown as a Commonwealth among the States, has there ever been promulgated to the legislative department a message which exhibited deeper insight into the af fairs of the State, or embraced in its scope more careful thought for the interests oi the people of all classes and conditions, oi wiser recommendations to secure these ends. In statesmanship, as in arms, in which our Governor was trained in knowledge and duty, he has displayed the greatness oi his nature, reflecting in clear, comprehen sive, straightforward action the wisdom oi the people when they called him to civil rule and responsibility. He came to the discharge of his duties at a time when a general gloom pervaded the Stale, and the hearts of the people were daspondent from the effects of partizan discord. He wae right when he convened the Legislature in special session, and made, with that body, a sincere and earnest effort to settle the public debt controversy, and, by the legis latiou then enacted, was forged the link ir the chain of procedure necessary to accom plish it. Tbe State paper now promulgated vfi be read with deep interest and great satis faction. It will impress the Legislature, because of the fullness of the review recommendations it contains. It will give tho people new opportunities to expresi their appreciation of their Governor for hie efforts to conduct all the interests of the State—one with the other—to a future o' mutual progress and power, and to secure to the people a large and full share of pros perity and contentment. With this general reference to the admi rable message of the Governor, we might end all we have to say at present, but it deals so clearly with a much-misrepresent ed and important duty of the Government —the support of tbe public school system anti its progrbss uuder Democratic direc tion—as to call for special commendation. Captious objections and misrepr,e«ieiiiat,u)na ought to cease, for the summary of its ope rations as given by the Governor, should ■every niau who piopoSf-s lp deal i that matter, and wiil surely do so ill take the time and trouble to careful aud thorough investigation, lovernor has done. Another chief _st—agriculture, the prosperity of which is so essential to all others—receives the .are of special recommendations in several respects, and the brgs majority of the members of the Legislature who Wd.e elected avowing a purpose to give it, ad ditional State aid, will, in their efforts to accou-i-lislJ that object, receive tho cordial support of the U-ove.-ior, who appreciates The PresiieiU 5 * J'pssage. We publish in full in this issue popias of the annual messages of both President! Cleveland aud Gov. Lee, aud both are ad mirable documents, which deserve to be; read, pondered, aud inwardly digested. In another article, we havo made a brief refer ence to that of Gov. Lee, and, if wo had the space, would give some comments on that of President C.evelaod, though it is so short) comparatively, and so interesting that it is uunecessary, ns all intelligent readers will examine it for therßSaiyes, and it speaks so plainly that it needs no eiplanafipu. The President carries a good level baad on his shoulders, and an honest, brave heart iv hi 3 bosom. Ha thiuks calmly and pro foundly, aud boldly and independently says what lie thiuks, teemingly wholly careless as to how It will affect his popularity and chances of being reelected. Ho exercises the liberty for which Milton prayed, wjjen pleading for the liberty of unlicensed pilot ing:— "Give me the liberty to know, to utter, aud to argue freely, according to con science, above al! liberties." He is the kiud or man in whop; the peo ple can repose confidence, whether they cop.- -cur iv all bis views or not. He practices no deception, and none of the arts of tho demagogic politician, but speaks honestly and frankly, letting all know exactly where and how be stands. That his message will be adversely criticised by many is to be ex pected, and even in those features whicli should be most comnieuded. Listen not to captious critisisms, but read the message and judge for yourself. We aiay notice some of these criticisms iv the future. Beware! Beware!! Mr. James P. Cooper, who has given his guaranty that those who bought coupons from him or bis agents should loso nothing, has issued a circular dated Dec. i)th, telling them that they must "stanl up to their side of the contract,'' and says:— "If the sheriff comes to them with an ex ecution for ths judgment, let them tender to him the exact amount of what ho claims, in coupons, or iv coupons and currency. If ha refuses the teuder and levies and sells, let them buy In their property at the gale, and report the facts to me. I will at once have suit instituted in the United States Court for damages for the sale. I must in sist that all purchasers of coupons with my guaranty shall stand up to their side of the contract of indemnity, as I shall stand up to mine." Those that may act upon this advice, and we suppose thoy will be but few, will be very apt to regret it, and the less they have to do with Cooper or his agents in the sale and use of coupons the better, for lawsuits are costly things, aud after the recent dcci sion of the Supremo Court, he must be very verdant indeed, who will expect to make anything by getting into a lawsuit with tbe State about the payment of taxes with coupons, — • '» I —i i imp. The West Viroinia Piiohibitionists. At a meeting of the State executive com mittee of the prohibition party of West Vir ginia, just held in Graftou, it was decided to enter the campaign in that State next year with a full ticket in the field. This action was unanimous. A representative will be sent to the national convention, and nominations will be made for State, congees ■ional, legislative and local officers. Efforts are to be taken at once to perfect tbe organ ization of tbe party throughout the State. This policy will defeat the proposition to incorporate a prohibition amendment iv the constitution of that Saate, a vote upou which wiil be taken next year. The lead era in the cause of prohibition in iljat State show but little practical sense. The English bondholders, through Mr, Win,. L.

The Republi cans voted for their caucus nominees who of course were defeated. Mr. Koiner presented the following reso lution : Whereas a pernicious practice, prompted by a gush of social friendship has been in dulged in of giving extra pay from the Treasury to the committee ccerks and pages of the Senate, in addition to their compen sation prescribed by law is unjust to the tax-payers of the State and unnecessary : therefore Resolved, That those who shall accept appointments to these places will be ex pected to be content with the pay as now fixed by law. Mr. Gordon raised the point that the reso lution was out of order, the House not hav ing been informed of the organization of the Senate. General Wickham suggested that the resolution be referred to the Finance Com mittee. Mr. Gordon's point was decided well taken, and the resolution was passed by. R. H. Cardwell, of Hanover, was elected Speaker of the House, and John Bell Big ger, Clerk. The Republicans voted for Edmund Waddill for Speaker. After the organization of both branches of the Legislature the Governor's message was received and read. It is published in full in this issue.

RESOLUTION. On Monday Mr. Koiuer's joint resolution in reference to Railroad transportation camo up in the Senate for Consideration when Mr. Koiner advocated it strongly. He thought this oue of the few important sub jects that this General Assembly bad to' consider, and he had no doubt that its dis cussion would consume some days, if unt weeks. Mr. Biackstone moved the reference to the Committee on Raids and Internal Nav igation. Ha was opposed to spacial com mittees wneu regular Goramittees had been appointed for these very subjects. Mr. Lovenstein echoed these same senti ments, as he had done beforo. Mr. Koiner insisted on the adoption of his resolution. After a lengthy discussion the motion of Mr. Liar.ksiv._e was carried by the recorded vote of 22 to il. In the House, Mr. Magruder of hhetiaa- i doah offered a resolution that any legislation ! at this session is unnecessary aod unwise. It was referred to committee on Courts of Justice. THE GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE. [Continued from fourth page.] plied to the public schools, the number of schools opened and teachers employed, and the number of pupils enrolled and the aver age attendance are all greater than any year since the system was inaugurated. Informa tion and detail and special recommendation will be contained in the forthcoming annual report of tbe Superintendent of Public In struction. The importance of such further judicious and frieudly legislation as will not only maintain but also increase the efficiency and usefulness of the system, earnestly oommends itself to the attention of the General Assembly. Reports from State institutions for techni cal and higher education exhibit an encour aging degree of prosperity. The financial condition of some of them has undergone decided improvement, while the patronage of them has been well sustained, and in nearly every instance has materially in creased. The present scholastic year is marked by a decided increase in tho num ber of matriculates in almost all of these institutions, while in some this increase is exceptionally large. In addition to the facilities afforded by the State for the ed ucation of her people, there are a number of excellent schools and colleges conducted by private individuals and by the different churches. While these have no connection with the State government, they are to be recognized as among the effective educa tional forces of the Commonwealth. It is a matter of special gratification that an un usual degree of prosperity is attending them during the current year- The inereaso in the number of scholars at schools of this class is proof of the growing prosperity of those who send them there. As an evideuce of tbe prosperous condi tion of our educational institutions, it may be mentioned that on the Ist of December, 1880, there were 287 students registered at ,the University of Virginia. On the same date this year there were registered 301.— At the Virginia Military lustitute ou the Ist of December, 1880, there were 135 ca dets. On the same date this year there were IqO cadets. s\t the Virginia 4srioul tural and Mechanical College on the Ist of December, 1886, there were 87 students.— At the corresponding date this year there were 130. The State Female Normal School at Farm ville is in its management, efficiency and re sults highly satisfactory. There are in the School of prafjtipe and Observation and Sor mal School proper 215 student. At the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute December 1, 1886, there were 102 academic students. On December 1, 1887, tbe number of academic students was 187. These institutions all deserve and should , receive the hearty support of the represen tatives of the people. Their work is closely woven with our entiro cystem. The higher round of the educational ladder may not be reached by all classes, but is i within reach of all who climb boldly and , successfully tbe lower rounds of tbe same laddtr. Indeed, Mr. Jefferson, tbe founder of our great University, expressed this view when he said; "We should always keep au eve steadily on the whole system of education"; while tho great German publicist, D'- Lie ber, represented the same idea when ha tells us that ''the uuiyersity and. thp com mon schools are tha two buttresses of the arch of public education." It is essential to the prospeiity of bulb that each should be kept stroug, sound and firm. In refeienoe to tbe public schools I would , recommend that by further legislation the . General Assembly endeavor to improve tha system in sparsely settled districts in the different counties J.n 'hese diatrigts the facilities for public achoo} education are sus ceptible of improvement. I would also rec . ommend that some legislative action be taken whi h would authorize the beginning of elemc niarj industrial education or manual training in the common and graded schools. Great technical schools with large endow ments are net within the reach of all, but by a modeiate expenditure by the local au • thoritles, elementary Industrial teaching can be introduced effectively in a large num ber of schools. I consider this a matter of great importance for the future as bringing about a more rapid development of the pro . ducts of our State and making useful mem bers in'their respective pomrnnities of her citizens. The Miller Manual Labor School i of Albemarle county, would be able to fur nish tcaphers in {his line for the white class es, while the Hampton Normal and Indus trial Institute could furnish teachers for the - colored classes. The splendid work the two institutions I have named are doing within the limits of the Commonwealth cannot be overestimated, and tha accomplished supt r intendents could doubtless give valuable ' suggestions as to the feasibility of introduc ing manual and industrial training into our public-school system. The rapid develop ' ment of thj industrial interest of Virginia points directly to the importance of giving special attention to these subjects. The Virginia Military Institute is doing ' its accustomed good work iv annually re turuiog to us educated men fully equipped 1 for civil or military work, ready aud pre ' pared for either. The drawing department of the Institute should be extended to cover tho changes constaully goiug on in the De partment of Applied Sciences, and an ap propriation should be made whion Would 1 enable the Institute to embrace the applica tion of photography, vow so necessary in engineering aud mining service. 1 The Agricultural aud Mechanical College, , al Black-burg is in a flourishing conditiou, with every prospect of a large increase in its usefulness. In order that, it may continue in to prosperous, cpuise and be productive of great b.uefit to our Mi ate, it suould re ceive liberal encouragement from the Legis lature. The State has appropriated noth ing for this institution since 1878. The bar . rack room is only capable of containing eighty-four men, while tho State is pledged to furnish quarters for 200, so that rooms for quarters have to be re;ited outside, a system prejudicial to good order anu military dis cipline. A proper building for a machine . shop is also necessary. The present small wooden buUdjng is entfrely inadequate to tbe necessities of this gieat branch of in sti uotioii. which is made a specialty at this college. I append to this report a letter from the president of the college in reference , to the details of the recommendations I here make. The Virginia Normal and Collegiate In stitute is also ia a good condition. The at tendance of teacher* at the summer session of 1887 was 181, and of that number 129 were granted certificates. In 1880 there were eight graduates from the Normal de uartaieut; it the commencement of this year there wero 18, all of whom are now eugaged in teaching colored schools for the State.— The work of this Institute has been some what obstructed by the want of accommoda tions. The additional building, however, is neariug completion, and when finished ths lust.itute will, it is reported, have ac commodations for at least 700 students, — From a personal inspection of the Institute 1 believe it is fulfilling its missiou, and car rying out the objects for which it W4S es tablished. 

ELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTIONS. An esA-iinatiou of the interesting reports of tbe Board of Directors ami the Superin tendents of the tour limine Asyiums and the Institution for tbe education of the Deaf, Dumb and Blind will show that the trusts reposed therein have beeu faithfully executed, beneficial sanative measures have been adopted proper regulations have beeu put in foice, and excellaut care and atteu tion bestowed upon the iuipatesr.ud pupils. Tbe recommendation contained in these reports in regard to insurance and other matters, will receive your cvj»ful oousidera tion, jbe Btale has no t)i;rlier or mote saoiedduty i'u&a the niainteuance of this unfortunate class of hercitijeus. During tbe past fiscal year ending Sep teraber 30, 1887, 420 applications wero re ceived at the X.stern, Western and South western Asylums for admission, and 817 wero admitted. All the colored insasjs oan be provided for, as soon as the. additions to tjie Central Lunatic Asylum aro completed. Iv tho Eastern Asylum tbe **«rsga num ber of patients lor the past 11-c i! year were 401; in tbe Western Asylum on October Ist there were 589; in the Southwestern 139; the present capacity cjf this asylum is 250; in the Gen'ral Asylum the dally a-eragefor tbe year was 470. 'Vuo uqrqbor of pupils at tl;e peaf, and Blind Institute rs cj34 I The additi.iml buildings to the O-ntral Lunatic Asylum, for which the legislature of 1880 appropriated $22,500 will be ready for use by the Ist of January next; 200 more patients can then be provided for. This will not only take all the colored insane out of jails, but relieves the asylum of its over crowded condition. The Superintendent re ports that "the increase of insanity among the colored race is amazing," and he fears that "in two years there will be from 150 to 200 colored insane unprovided for." There seems to have been a most injudi cious use made of the $202,000 appropriated for the erection of the main building to the Asylum. In a statement erabodying the re sult of a recent examination of the building made by a competent architect, at the re quest of the President of the Board of Di rectors its condition and manner of construc tion is fully set forth, and the fact disclosed that the State is not in possession of such a building as her liberal appropriation for it would seem to justify. The foundation walls in many places are cracked already, aud the bricks are of snob inferior make and material that they are being orushed by tho weight above. agriculture. There is no question which oan be brought before the Legislature of more importance to Virginia than the promotion of her agri cultural interests. It has been well said that a plea for the farmers is a plea for the State, and the great number of our citizens who are engaged in providing for themselves and their families a support from the soil, should incline their representatives to the passage of all laws Which will advance the interests of the farmers. The whole State will at once feel any vigorous increase in its agricultural prosperity. The career for stock-raising and sheep farming in the future is broad, but the development of the small industries aud gram growing has not been attended in some parts of the State with gratifying re sults. The present faithful and efficient Com missioner of Agriculture is diligently striv ing to bring about a better condition of things iv his department, but the means of accomplishing this end are very limited. I recommend an increased appropriation for the Department of Agriculture, to be provided for either hy a tax upon fertilisers or in such other way as the General As sembly may determine to be best. I would also recommend that the Commissioner of Agriculture be made a member ex-officio of the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Agri cultural and Mechanic .1 College at Blacks burg, and bear tbe same relation to that college as the Adjutant General will do to the Virginia Military Institute after the Ist of January next. I would also recom mend, io this connection, that a bureau of immigration, labor aud statistics be estab lished as a part of the Department of Agri culture; for the Commissioner of Agricul ture well says: "An active bureau of im migration on enlisting tiie <<o-o.pyr.atian of railToati authorities and all organisations having for tbeir object the iiitroduatioa of immigrants into Virginia, oau do much for promoting the settlement of her waste lands, fostering manufactures aud creating markets," 

STATE PENITENTIARY. The State penitentiary, under the man agement of 'its Board of Directors and its capable S iperinteudent, serves well its pur poses. Tue number of convicts ou the Ist of this month was 1160, IQQ beiug white and »7u colored; or 185 white males, fO6 color ed males, 5 white females and 64 colored females; 807 of them are in prison, 115 on the South Atlantic and Ohio railroad, and 38 in Russell county. There has not been much demand for the' convicts to work the public roads of the Commonwealth under laws already massed App icati ms aro cow -,nd then made for them t_ work the railroad*, but iv conse quence of such projected roads not beiug completed, aud for other reasons, In many eases such applications are not further in sisted upon. In this connection I have the honor to re commend that a reformatory or industrial school be established, either separate aud detached from the penitentiary or in con nection therewith, where youthful criminals can be ooniiued without commit ' into con tact with the older and more hardened class of offenders. There should be a wide discrimiuntion in the treatment of a boy convicted perhaps of his first offence against the law ar_d a man who has probed to tbe tha depths of criipe. the punish ment of criminal youths should have a re formatory as well as a punitive object, but it is impossible to put into practice reform atory rueaaures where two classes of crim inals ome into daily contact with each other. In the penitentiary at this time there are 107 criminals under the age of twenty one years. I would also recommend that a law be passed placing iv this reformatory school all criminals under eighteen years of age, and that tha Governor be empowered to transfer from the penitentiary to that reformatory school any other between the age of eigh teen ant} twenty-r.uo v;i.ero bops it) held out that such indulgence would hot be misused aud there was a reasouabla hope of recla mation. A system of this sort has worked satisfac torily iv several of the States. During Gov. Hoadly's administrat.iou in Ohio, of eighty boys thus released from the penitentiary and transferred to the reformatory school, cng became insane, went L,ac,k to crime, anci severity-three proved worthy of the indulgence granted, them. To reclaim from a life of crime even one young soul would be a satisfactory work, With the growing population of the State the number ot criminals increases and an enlargement of the preseut penitentiary is already domanded. By the proposed sepa rate arrangement for youthful criminals ad ditional loom vjould be gained for the ot.bpr classes or malefactors. * I have the honor also to recommend that a system of monthly Inspection of all jails in tho State be made by tbe Common wealth's Attorney, nr such local officer as the judue of the citf or county in which said jail may be located shall desiguate.aud a wntteu report be made to such judge lifter o eh inspection, and such report bo spread upon the records. The geuaj and qhirttabk of the Stale will be inspected by the Governor or some officer designated by him 'is often as be may think proper and praotio.ble. I have already personally inspected moat of these institutions, and fouad thßir condition iv every r.spect most creditable to their management. VOLUNTEER TRQOf.S. -tinije the Ist of January last the following volunteer troops have been called out by the oivil authorities to assist their officers in preserviug the peace in their respective lo calities, namely: Ou Ja vary llth compa nies A and B, First regiment, under com mand of Maj. Bidgood, and Guard of colored troops, the whole being under the direction of Brig.-Geo. Charles Anderson, were called to Newport News at the request of tbn judie of Warwick county. Ou Au gust 30.h the Mayor of Petersburg called upon It E. Lee Battery, the Petersburg Grays and the Petersburg Guard, the first two beiug white and the last a colored com pany, to be in readiness to assist him iv preserving the peace there, and on the llth of November the Mayor of Pocahontas, Tazewell county, with the co-operatiou of the civil officers of that oouutv, requested troops to preserve the peace iv the mine. The Fitz Ijee Troop, the Lynchburg Artil lory and t'le Lynohburg Home Guard were accordingly sent to that poiut. Tne prompt arrival of the troops at, thesa points and the soldierly conduct of both officers and men in a large degree prevented a; of the ps&ee their only mission was to pre serve. I, A well regulated militia is "nec essary to the security of a free state," and the Commonwealth should be read? to promote th 9 efficiency and discipline of her volunteer soldiery, Who iv turn are ever prompt with their services in preserving law, peace and order within lier borcjers. The voluuteer militia, numbering about three thousand men, are better equipped, better armed, disciplined and drilled than aver before in the history of tha State, and can be upon in a,ay emergency. It is seen I hat I availed myself of the ser if .ces of tb" colored as wpll as the white ?ul djers, a,qd ray confic[-in,ce ig tlje performance of their doty waa not misplaced. At Newports Nows in the rnidsc of threat ened disturbance of the peaoe by their own race, the company sent there was resolute and firm, whether on the sentinel post or io company treat, aud were ever ready to C,bej with alacrity t\ny ortjerfro.-B the ofyaer coift waridyig. At the htat'i-ial Drill and Encampment in Washin-ton in May, or in Philadelphia at the celebration of the Centennial of the Federal Constitution in September last; or whether in ths procession at the laying of tbe corner-stone of the Lee Monument in October last, the good conduct and soldierly behavior and military appearance of the State troops won universal commendation and reflected credit npon Virginia. The dear and comprehensive report of tbe Adju tant General gives in detail the necessary information about our volunteer troops. soldiers' home. When Virginia called upon her sons to rally to her defence in 1801, from highest mountain-top to lowermost valley the cry was heard, filling her ranks with brave men upon whose daily labor helpless women and little children leaned for livelihood. Twen ty six years have passed since then, and the boy who rushed to battle as to a banquet is the maimed veteran of to-day, in many in stances helpless aud houseless. Upon the suburbe of this city a beautiful Home for homeless Confederate soldiers has been established by private donations, solic ited by the "R. E. Lee Camp," and which will probably ultimately become the proper ty of the State. The time has come when the State should call together and support there the few re maining years of their lives the soldier and sailor who in maintaining Vitginia's fUg upon many a hard-fought field can no longer maintain himself. I recommend a generous annual contribution for this pur pose. JUDGE HUSTINGS COURT CITY OP STAUNTON. I have the honor to state that the resigna tion of J. W. Green Smith, judge of the Hustings Court of the city of Staunton, was accepted at request, to take effect on the 31st of October last. His term of office would not expire by limitation until the Ist of January, 1889.— The interval between the dates of the ac ceptance of the resignation and the meeting of the Legislature was brief, and I therefore declined to make an appointment to fill the vacancy lest it might in some way enrfbarass the action of this Legislature, whose duty it is to elect his successor, »I VIPINB THE STATE INTO GRAND DIVISIONS. Another subject I think of sufficient im portance to call to your attention is the separation of the State into geographical divisions, whose limits shall be clearly de fined; indeed, I would recommend that the counties by name ba placed in the respec tive divisions, so that the execution of the laws, particularly as regards boards of visi tors to the State institutions, oan be strictly parried otjl, CAPITOL BUILDING. I feel it my duty to call the attention of the Legislature to tbe condition of the building now used as the State Capitol. It has been lor years inadequate for State purposes and offices are now vented at the State's expense iv different portions of the c}tj for the Buperiudent of Publio 4nstructi6u, tbe Commissioner of Ra I roads, the Commisbloner of Agriculture, the Superlnteudent of Public Printing, tbe Adjutant General, and the Court r.f peals. Apart from this, the constant in. crease in storage of valuable hooka, papers aud recoidß in tbe Library and other por tions £,• the building has accumulated by 13tic,b weight as to jeopardize human life while tbe danger from Are, always great, especially in the Library, would involve an irreparable loss to the State of books, pa pers, records, paintings, cSso., which could never be replaced. To meet the pressing wants of the State's service it is necessary either to turn your faces from the memo ries, rich aod rare, which cluster around the old edifice, and build a new and larger Capitol with greater facilities for the pur poses of the State, or ta erect a suitable building elsewhere to contain the Library, historical records, Stato offices, Court of Appeals, &C, &o Of the two plans I would recommend the latter. In that case the old Capitol could be remodelled in the basement and Library story and ample room cbtaiced for legislative purposes, committee rooms and a few State offices.— In this connection I call your attention to the report of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund in response to a resolution pf tho General Assembly in regard to the cost of a State building for the purpose in dicated, known as H. D. No. 12 of the ses sion of 1883-'B4, as it contains such useful information on the subject. I would re commend that a committee of two from the Senate} and three fro_a the House be at onse appointed to take the whole subject into consideration, including plan, location aod price of such a structure and to report the result cf their investigation as soon as possible that this Legislature may act promptly in the matter. I have been in formed that the Library in the Capitol has caught fire already a number of times, and in view of its great value, the State should lose as little time as possible in safely placing its valuable records in a fire-proof building. There has already been set apart for the coustruction of this building Rid diebergcr bonds as follows: Face vuluo of P.lddlebersrqr uonuo held by Bcasd. »169,VU0, tbe market v»lua of which at 63 cauls $102816 00 Also a bond of Liie Tredegar Com pany due March 16-19,1883. for $5,935 55 lnten-st for three years 7,037 55 On deposit Merchants National Ba k, Richmond. Va 22 25 Malting a total c-f 5109.575 80 already available for this purpose. The money with which thpse bonds were bought was realised from the sale of real estate owned by the Commonwealth as set forth in Acts 1883- -t, chapter 233, seotion i, and the proceeds of sale invested required by section 8 of saaio act approved March 10th, 1884 I advise that an appropriation be made for painting the outside of the Capitol, Governor's mausiou and outbuildings — Their appearance and preservation alike demand it REGISTER UK LAND OFFICE. I hope the Legislature will closely search the expense account of the Government and promptly reduce disbursements wher ever it can be done without injuiy to the public service, and where such expeaditures are unnecessary abolish them In this way the amount to be taken from tha revenue accouut will be aud the surplus in come gveater." As a beginning of this good work, I have the honor to recommend tbat the position of tbe Register of the Land Office be abol ished, aod that all papers, book? aud re cords bo. turned over to the Second, Audi tor's Office. Second. That the police force for duty at the Capitol and public grounds be composed as now of seven members, to be appointed by the Governor, ono of whom shall be known as chief of police and superinten dent of public buildings. This officer should, be held responsible for the strict perfor mance of their duties by the police, and shall, by the direction of the Governor, have charge of the repairs to public build ings, aud see tbat tho public grounds are kept clean and in every respect in good condition. Tbe pay of the six policemen shall be the samo as they receive now—namely, $US per momb, aud the pay of the chief of police be ?85 per month. I have also to recommend tbat the con. vict labor now employed at the Capitol and public grounds be replaced by the work of men who have not c irnraitted bffeaoes against tbe State laws; thia work is done nefw by seven oonvicts, some of whom are guarded by the Capitol police, and others labor uuder a guard from the penitentiary. The work done by these convicts can bf much more satisfactorily pevforoiei by t tree or four good laborers'at say thirty dollars per moiVtli, to be selected and em ployed by the chief of police. The official reports from heads oi various departments of the Government have all been rendered j they wiil be found faithful iv detail and full of'material ; aud fb these reports you are respectfully referred. And u.ir to yiiu, gentlemen of the As sembly, I commit the important subjects Urought to your attention, with confident hope that your enactments will exalt tho civilzition, promote the tranquility, and increase the happiness and prosperity of the people of thia great Commonwealth.
