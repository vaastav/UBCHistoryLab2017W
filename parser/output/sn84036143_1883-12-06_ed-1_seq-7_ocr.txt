LOCAL NEWS. From the Daily Herald of December 3. INTENT VS. THE LETTER THE LAW. OF We do not propose to devote our space chiefly to reviewing the decisions of the courts, though recognizing the legal right, and often propriety, in discussing through the press questions of law that greatlv concern the people. The ques tion who shall do the little printing the Territory needs concerns very few. 80 long as the work is done full as well, or better, and at no increased cost, there will not be a half dozen people in the Territory who will waste a regret. It is not right, however, that any por tion of the people should for a time even think that .Judge Wade's recent decision was in disagreement with the best au thorities on the subject of interpreting law. All authorities concur that when the letter of the law is clear, explicit, without ambiguity, there is no chance or occasion tor interpretation. Only those things need interpreting that are obscure, or in foreign tongues. When the law says, in language that all can understand, and none can misunderstand, "that said contract shall be made and continued in force for the period of two years from the date of its execution," there is not a word or combination of words that is involved in doubt, so there is no room for the application of the principle stated by Mr. Sedgewick. The great expounder quotes a Montana statute to show that the singular includes the plural; the trouble is not so easily removed. It was impossible in the nature of the case for more than one con tract tor the territorial printing to be made immediate/;/ after the passage of the act. If the court is to run around the streets or inquire of members of the legislature what was the intent of any particular law. there would be wide diversity of opinion and no possibility of reaching a just conclusion. If the intent was, as the Independent insists, to keep that ]taper alive, it was clearly a case against public policy, and accepting this avowed intent, it was the dutv of the court to set it aside. The Tinancy.of An "S." It strikes us as ungrateful, to say the least, that the Independent should slur the intelligence of members of the Legislature with whom, until now, it has been in polit ical affiliation, by ascribing to their lack of learning the chief cause which led to the death of the Printing law. It is seri ously charged that by the neglect of its then partisan friends in the Assembly to pluralize the singular number of a noun, the Democratic organ is robbed of a pen sion intended for its benefit in perpetuity. This is the plain inference to be drawn from the argument of the Independent, in its alleged review of the decision of Judge Wade. This aspersion, in the light of known facts, will be universally regarded as unwarranted. The paternity of the Printing law' is traced back to the bill drafted by the editor of the Independent, (Barrett,) who stood sponsor for it and lobbied it through the Assembly, with no material amendment attached except as it applied to a reduction in printing charges. In no other essential particular was the bill as originally prepared altered. We re fuse to go back in the years to ascertain whether, as suggested by the Independent, there were more Missourians than grammarians in the Legislative body that passed its bill. 11 iseuough to know that there rvere Missourians who disdained to be reckoned grammarians outside of the Leg islature, and we recall no one who more jauntily plumed himself upon this circum stance than the neAvspaper editor avIio dreAv the printing bill, bossed it through its various stages to a law, and Avas respon sible not only for its orthography, but for other and glaring defects which closed its life after an existence protracted beyond its time. _ _ Inter Mountain : We much regret to see that the statesman-editor of the In dependent, avIio was once a lawyer him self both in Missouri and Montana, is greatly angered at Judge Wade on ac count of the latter's decision on the printing Iuav. To those who only enjoy the pleasure of an intimate acquaint ance with Col. Woolfolk, it is very plain that his anger has not been excited by any prospective pecuniary loss. The Colonel is not that kind of a man. He probably cares less for the almighty dol lar than any man in Montana and spends his accumulations Avith a lavish hand. His objection to Judge Wade's decision, therefore, is by no means at tributable to the probability of his los ing a portion of the public printing. The Colonel has no use for money. We have his own eloquent words to the effect that he pins his faith to the "great popular heart" (very likely meaning that of Maginnis) and filthy lucre is not in any sense the object of his labors. It is quite evident that the legal light of the In dependent grounds his opposition to the printing Iuav decision to the defectiv'e le gal points upon which it is based and upon the errors of his honor's conclu sions. But here is a chance for argu ment. The opinion is incontrovertible on the score of legality, and this fact renders it necessary for the public to con clude that the Helena journalist knows nothing about law. The mere question of money certainly cuts no figure in the a OA L. ed From the Daily Herald of December 4. Reduced Pay of Postal Officers. The Washington Evening Star gives this version of the removal of Inspector Furay, of the Postal Service * " Captain John B. Furay, late Postoffice Inspector at Omaha, Nebraska, has taken issue with the Post master General in behalf of the fifty-seven Postoffice Inspectors in the country, and intends to contest the retroactive force of Judge Gresham's decision fixing the per f diem allowance for expenses at the actual j daily expenditure while traveling. Mr. Furay claims that the chaDge was made in November, and therefore could not affect his October accounts. The Postoffice De partment held the reverse, and asked Mr. Furay to send in his bill on the new basis. Mr. Furay wrote a very sharp letter to the Department, denying the right to change the pay of an employe withoui bis consent after the service had been rend« the receipt of this letter he wa Mr. Furay intends to bring the matter to an issue by an appeal to the courts." The order of Judge Gresham affects other branches of the service, including officers of the raihvay mail divisions, whose pay for October is to be audited and allowed on the basis of the November decision. 1. Upon j iamoved, Dissatisfaction is general among Inspec- ! tors, Assistant Superintendents, and others. One of the railway mail officers stationed in Montana, Avas notified that his October accounts were disalloAved and could only be paid on the basis of the order of No vember. He Avrote the Department to the ef fect that the reduced pay Avas insutlicient to support himself and family and asked to be recalled from the Territory. Silver Coin and Silver Bullion. The Avay to keep up the standard value of American coinage is to patronize the manufacture od' the raw material into use ful and economical articles of household table use, and of ornaments of dress and decoration. The conversion of silver bars into useful articles of the table and orna ments of personal adornment has assumed such immense proportions that even the simplest articles are made of solid silver, and embrace a large portion of the stock of every first class jewelry store. These facts are practically illustrated in the great variety of solid silver manufactured goods just received by George 1'. Peeves & Co., of Helena. A glance at the stock and a com parison of the real silver Avith the prices and appearance of the plated articles will convince the purchaser that it is economy to buy the very best, tor in this line can the choicest and most beauti designs be worked up by the mastei artists of this country, which surpass all others in the perfection of their chasings and de signs of silverware and orurmeuts. Es pecially is this true of the Gorham Manufacturing Company, of Providence, I«'bode Island, from Avhom Geo. P. Peeves & Co. have just received their magnificent supply of holiday silver goods. This com pany consumes four tons of silver bars every month in the manufacture of solid silver goods, Avhich, in hard dollars, amounts to one million two hundred and eighty thousand. The numerous new ar ticles which make up the large field of family treasures embrace ice-cream knives of the gilt antique battle-axe pattern, with antique unmatched spoons. Pie knives, crumb scrapers, soup ladles, gravy ladles, forks and spoons, of the Marigold pattern ; solid silver fruit dishes, card baskets, ice cream bowls, invalid solid silver tea sets; the latest styles of table, desssert, coffee and tea spoons; solid pepper and salts, oyster forks and present ation cups ; in fact, the neAV opening of solid silverware embraces presents from a silver thimble to a diamond cross or neck lace. A specialty of George 1*. Peeves & Co. is diamond setting, which can be seen at their store in all the perfection of the art. They have under the hands of their skillful jeweler. Mr. Steinmetz, a gold cross being set with diamonds to cost $1,300 dollars; a crescent gold, diamond pin, to cost $800, and a brooch that will cost $750. The prices of their solid ware are as low as the trade prices at Tiffany's, NeAV York, or Levy's, in Philadelphia. Their supply of mantle and ornamental clocks are peculiarly adapted for useful and valuable presents for the holidays. Also, gold and silver Avatches for ladies and gentlemen. Valuable oil paintigs and other precious articles are lor sale, and as displayed in their store they correspond in taste and or namentation to the general display of fine goods purchased especially for the holidays. The stock of solid silver, which alone cost OA r er $14,00o, is probably as fine as can be found this side of Chicago. Board of Trade. ern his the tal per. try, j j in ! to Board of Trade.

At their meeting yesterday the Commis sioners of Lewis and Clarke county award ed the contract for keeping, maintaining and clothing the county poor on the Poor Farm to Mr. Gleason, the present con tractor, at $6 each per week.

The President's Message. f o'clock, and within j hour thereafter the In addition to the regular telegraphic report, the usual editorial and local mat ter, miscellany, etc., the Herai.d of Tues day contained the complete text of the President's message delivered on the after noon of that day to Congress. In order to accomplish this big piece of work the pub lication hour was set back to about 8 the space of a half entire business and resident portions of Helena were served with the paper. The Herald printers commenced to put the message in type at 1 o'clock p. m., Avitli a force strong enough to have handled the com plete document in five hours, but the usual aggravating delays in transmis mission failed to keep the compositors sup plied with copy, and obliged the disposing j of it piecemeal. It is a difficult matter to transmit by Avire the exact text of a paper as formidable as that of the President's message, especially to points as distant as Montana, several distinct relays of opera tors being required to take it up and report it along the Avay. Especially is this true as to the treasury statement, Avith its formidable and confusing array of figures, ! Avhich are frequently Avrong and meaning less after passing through so many hands, and which are supposed to be printed as wired, though known to be incorrect. As a Avhole, Ave venture the assertion that no previous message of the Executive, on so short a notice, Avas ever presented to the public of Montana in so creditable a form as that of President Arthur's in yesterday's Herald. ----- -«>- ---------- ■■ Katie Putnam, Who is pre-eminently a Montana favorite, will begin an engagement under John Maguire's management, at Ming's Opera House next Monday evening. That the engagement will he an unqualified success there is no reason to doubt, as she is the "town talk" at present. "When is Katie Putnam coming," is every one's query. Her present season has been a series of brilliant successes, packing the largest the atres everywhere she appears, being the rule. Her appearance in Denver and Salt Lake recently might be aptly termed, in point of attendance, a public ovation. She has at present a very superior supporting company, and a rush for reserved seat:, here is expected Avhen the sale begins the latter part of the Aveek. Wedding Bells.
