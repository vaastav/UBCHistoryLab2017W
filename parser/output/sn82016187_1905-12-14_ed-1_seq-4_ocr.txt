It devel ops that Rumania and Bulgaria were In alliance to attack Turkey in the in terests of the independence of Maca donia. but their action was prevented by the settlement of the difficuitus. Education is not making the pro gress in Cuba that the enthusiasts for that panacea for all troubles iiave hoped for There seems to be a grow ing indiff? re nee on the part of parents and children as to education; the at tendance on the schools is falling off very rapidly, and the character of the instruction is such as to justify severe criticism bv President Palma in his message. Hon. Webster Davis, formerly As sistant Secretary of the Interior, has executed another political tlank move ment and tins time back to the Repub lican Party. He writes from Los An gelas renouncing Democracy and pro fessing his great admiration for Theo dore Roosevelt. He will support ihe Republican Party as long as the Pres dent's policies are upheld by it, and regards Theodore Roosevelt as the greatest man in the history of the Re public. There is a seethe of boiling resent ment by Republican members of Con gress at the recent order that Presi dential Postmasters shall remain in office as long as they give satisfaction to the Department and to the patrons of the office. A still further stricture has developed In a rule that in future Representatives shall only be permit ted to scrutinize the papers in Post Office cases upon direction of th? Post master-General or his First Assistant. This privilege of examining the papers In these cases is one of the immemorial ones to members of Congress, and It is not given up without much resistance. The Culifornians are decidedly of the opinion that there is danger of a flux of Japanese immigration as dangerous as that of the Chinese, and the Congres sional delegation has agreed upon a bill for tiie exclusion of both Japanese and Koreans. The bill will be Intro duced by Representative McKinley, who was Assistant United States Dis trict Attorney in San Francisco, and charged with the duty of 2*?*orcing the Chinese Exclusion Act. It is said there are 60.000 Japanese in California and nearly 100.000 in the United States. Last year more than 8,000 Japanese came to this country, mainly by the way of the Hawaiian Islands. THE 

PRESIDE JIT'S MESSAGE. %\hile the subjects covered by the President's Message did not have the intense interest of many previous an nual communications to Congress, they covered a far wider range, and all of them were matters upon which ths people are thinking quite deeply. The pith of his views upon the con trol of industrial corporations was con tained in the following: "So long as the finances of the Na tion are kent upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which Congress has the power to d? al begins to approach in importance tin matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the individuals?and especially the great corporations?doing an inter state business are to act. * * ? It is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition, whether this restraint be reasonable or unreasona ble; and where it is not useless it is generally hurtful." This is a very general observation, with its main practical application be ing that we should go quite slowly and cautiously in this species of legislation, if we entered upon it at all, which we liad better not. His views on railroad legislation are much more specific, and are in ac cord with the best thought of the coun try at the present time: In my judgment, the most import ant provision which such a law (regu lating railroad rates) should contain is that conferring upon some competent! aumiiUstralive body the power to de-' cide, upon the rase being brought be fore it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, ar.d if it is found to be unreasonable and unjust, then, after full investiga tion of the complaint,' to prescribe the hniit of rate beyond which it shall not hr lawful to go?the maximum reason able rate, as it is commonly called? this decision to go into effect within a r'asonaole time and to obtain from th? nee onward, subject to review by the courts." This means that the Interstate Com merce Commission, or a similar tribun al, should be clothed with power to summarily reduce an exorbitant rate, but that the courts should have author ity to review the action of the Com mission, and reverse it if unjust. As to Federal control of insurance com panics he says: "Recent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question to see whether it is not possible to furnish better safeguards than the several States have boon ah|p to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which ha*- been exposed, it has been only too cl?; ?ly shown that certain of the men at i*ie "nea 1 of these large corporations take but small note of the ethical dis tinction between honesty ami dishon eM>, they draw the line only this side of what may bo call"d law honesty, the, kind of honesty necessary to avoid * falling into the clutches of the law." i his is quite non-committal. It goes no farther than a proper censure of flagrantly dishonest officials. With regard to Tariff Revision the President balances his phrases judi ciously. but the inclination of the beam is toward the Stand-Patters. He says: "There is more need of stabilitv than of the attempt to attain an ideal per fection in the methods of raising reve nue; and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods render such a change inadvisable unless for grave reason. Tt is not possible to lay down any general rule by which to de termine the moment when the reasons for will outweigh the reasons against such a change. ? ? ? It is as yet too early to attempt to outline what shape such a readjustment should take, for It is as yet too early to say whether there will be need for it. It should be considered whether it is not desira ble that the tariff laws should provide for appjying as against or in favor of any other Nation maximum and mini mum Tariff ratos established by the Congress, so as to secure a certain reci procity of treatment between other Nations and ourselves." In other words: Any suggestion of revision of the Tariff will have a chill ing effect upon the present prosperity, and only warranted by reasons of the gra\est nature. Are there any such reasons? If there are, they have not yet developed sufficiently to attruct general attention. It seems much more necessary Just now to consider recipro cal trade arrangements with other countries, using our present schedule as a lever to obtain Tower rates for Amer ican products with our best customers. As to campaign contributions he says: "In political campaigns in a country as large and populous as ours It is In evitable that there should be much ex pense of an entirely legitimate kind, this, of course, means that many con tributions, and some of them of large size, must be made. * * * if they are xtorted bj> any kind of pressure or promise, express or implied, direct or indirect, in the way of favor or immun ity, then the giving or receiving be comes not only improper but criminal. All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any political purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be per mitted to use stockholders' money for any such purpose." Every word of this is certain to be approved. Every campaign committee should have considerable money to ex pend in what are necessary and proper expenses. A sufficiency ought always to be readily obtainable from those who have the success of their party at heart, and any sort of involuntary con tribution should be put under the ban or the criminal law. Anything that savors of blackmailing insurance cor porations and banks should be made distinctly criminal, and. on the other hand, those institutions, which are public utilities of the most important kind, should be made to conduct them selves so that there could be no oppor tunity for blackmailing. There is al most always a consciousness of having done something wrong when a man al U ws himself to be blackmailed, and in stitutions which allow themselves to be so bled are following courses which will not admit of publicity. There is no uncertain sound in the utterance about the Monroe Doctrine, and European Nations will take due notice and govern themselves accord ingly. He Hays: "That our rights and inter* deeply concerned in the main: ,ance of the (Monroe) Doctrine is so cJ-ar al* hardly to need argument. This is e? timi'8"/1irUp in Vlew of lhe construc tion of the Panama Canal. As a mere matter of self-defense we must exerctae ?h? ?t,W|atCh J?V?r the aPPr<>aches to this canal, and this means that we must be thoroughly alive to our inter ests In the Caribbean Sea." This means that Germany, nor no other Nation, shall be allowed to ac quire coaling stations in Santo Domin go and the Danish West Indies. As to Santo Domingo herself'the President bafc no thought of receding from the virtual protectorate we have estab lished there. He says: "We must ourselves In good failh try to help upward toward pence and order those of our sister republics which need such help. * ? ? Santo Do mingo, in her turn, has now made an appeal to us to help her, and not only every principle of wisdom but every generous instinct within us bids us re spond to the appeal. ? * ?" As to the Navy the President's views are clear and decided: "To cut down the Navy would be a crime against the Nation. Our Navy must, relatively to the navies of other Nations, always be of greater size than our Army. We have most wisely con tinued for a number of years to build up our Navy, and it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. . This standard of efficiency must not only be maintained but increased. It does not seem to me necessary, however, that the Navy should?at least in the im mediate future?be Increased beyond the present number of units." In regard to immigration the Presi dent falls into his too-frequent habit of broad generalization, without any spe cific recommendation. He says: "The question of immigration is of vital interest to this country. In the year ended June 30, 1905, there came to the United States 1,026,000 alien Im migrants. * * * As I said in my last mfssage to the Congress, we cannot have too much immigration of the ripht sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort." He recommends that the Canyon of the Colorado be made a National Park, and that New York should take provi dent care of the scenic buties of Niag ara Falls. His recommendation as to Statehood for the Territories is explicit and de cided, and will meet with much opposi tion in New Mexico and Arizona. He says: "I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admltttd as one State and that New Mexico and Ari zona be admitted as one State. * * * There is no justification for further de lnv, and the advisability of making the four Territories two States has been clearly established." There is no wavering or doubt about the Panama Canal. It must be dug with all reasonable speed. The only question before Congress, is that of the type of canal, but this it must settle from the information he will furnish it. He says: "Two points about the (Panama) Canal have ceased to be open to de bate. First, the question of route; the canal will he built on the Isthmus of Panama. Second, the question of feas ibility; there are no physical obstacles ??n this route that American engineer ing skill will not be able to overcome without serious difficulty, or that will prevent the completion of the canal within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. "The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level, or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the Congress at an early day the findings of the Advisory Hoard of American and European En gineers. that at my invitation have been considering the subject, together with the report of the Commission thereon, and sueh comments thereon or recom mendations in reference thereto as may seem necessary." He insists that no idea of economy should be allowed to interfere with appropriations either for the Navy or the Panama Canal, and does this so strenuously as to indicate that these ar leading features of the Administra tion's policy. The Message is a State paper of thor oughly practical nature. It is full of "business" from start to finish, and outlines enough work to fully occupy all the time that Congress has at its disposal. If Congress should take up each item seriatim, and give a reason able amount of attention to it, it would have to be in session pretty late in the Summer, and not waste many hours in buncomb speeches, either. Undoubtedly Cuba is in a bad way, and it looks as If the United States would have to exercise a restraining hand upon its financial mismanage ment. There is great danger that the Government will be sunk under a load of debt which will be crushing to the people. There Is a horde of money sharks, both American and Spanish, who are draining the treasury to the last dollar. The pretext for this is the payment to the "patriotic soldiers." This is a mere pretext and very trans parent to everyone. The army of Cuba was never more than a few thousands, and there was scarcely any attempt to keep rolls or accurate returns. Con sequently anybody who was living on the island at the time can be palmed off for a soldier by a trickster, who i then buys his claim for a few silver I dollars. The Cuban Government ne gotiated a $35,000,000 loan, of which about $28,500,00 was to be devoted to the payment of the mysterious myriad known as the "Army of liberation." Very little of this money went Into the pockets of those who had ever been In camp under Gomez or rendered any service whatever. Getting' this vast amount only whetted the appetites of the money-sharks, and the recent ses sion of the Congress authorized bonds to the amount of $14,000,000 to further pay this same band of soldiers. The new issue was made to evade the Piatt amendment by calling it an "in terior debt," and President Palma gave his reluctant acquiescence for fear that he would be defeated for re-elec tion. For a while Cuba has been very prosperous, but the price of sugar has fallen so much as to greatly curtail the revenues of the people, and this new debt. It is felt, will be more than they can stand and have money for any other purpose. Against the general protest of the better part of English people and of those In South Africa, the mining com panies imported great numbers of, Chinese coolies. Their experiences with these has been very far from satisfac tory. In the first place. In spite of ail inspection, the Chinamen are a badly diseased lot, and bring with them foul disorders. The next step Is that they do not seem to have as much intelli gence as a negro in the use of explo sives, and a number of very bad acci dents have resulted. Thirdly, they are more than usually treacherous. It has been found that it is not safe for any one to go up a ladder or in a bucket without having a Chinaman ahead of him, because somebody will certainly be dropping stones and pieces of Iron down upon the unlucky one. I^astlv, the Chinaman is charged with being absolutely destitute of any moral sense. He cannot be controlled by any emotion except fear, and the fear must be constant to hold him in tfeeck. 

SECRETARY r TAINT'S REPORT. Secretary Tfaft's annual report con tains an unusual number of subjects of the great estb interest. Naturally he gives much space to tho Panama Canal, and his views' ar^ entirely hopeful. Ho explains the necessity for an emergen cy appropriation-of $16,600,000 by say ing that the pay-roll is something like $600,000 a month, and that, expecting there would be ap extra session of Con gress in October; the work was pushed ahead to the limit of the money on hand at tha,t time, anticipating that Congress would make further provi sion. In his decent visit to the Isthmus the Secretary found everything in a much more advanced condition that at his visit the year previous. Good housing has been provided for the em ployes, the yellow fever has been stamped out, and all the subordinates have the highest confidence in Chief Engineer Shonts, who has done a great work in organizing and co-ordln atlng the different bureaus p.nd divi sions so that they all work together in harmony, and the results of every man's work are properly known and valued, so that efficiency meets its just appreciation and reward. The Panamans are very much pleased with the change and cheerful and happy with the prospects for the future. In regard to the Philippines the Sec retary strongly urges that all the pro ducts of the Islands, except sugar and tobacco, be allowed free entry into the ports of the United States, and that sugar and tobacco shall have a duty of only 25 per cent of the present tar iff imposed upon them for three years, and that after 1909 there shall be com plete free trade between the Islands and the United States. He also wants the coastwise law relating to trade be tween the Philippines and this coun try suspended until 1909, so that the passage of vessels between these ports shall be as free as our Internal com merce. He does not believe that the lowering of the duties on sugar and tobacco will in any manner affect the prices of those commodities in the United States, while it will be the greatest encouragement to the devel opment of the agricultural resources of the Islands. The Secretary renews his recom mendation for the consolidation of all the Military Park Commissions into a single Commission of three or five members, which will be nn economy and also tend to hasten the completion of the work. The Secretary urges the adoption of the proposed measures providing for the increase of the artillery, the crea tion of a coast defense reserve and for the regulation of promotion and an in crease of officers in the Regular Army. The suggested measures would increase the cost of the military establishment about $3,000,000 a year, but it seems absolutely necessary, especially with regard to the sea-coast fortifications, which have a mass of heavy and cost ly guns with complicated machinery and expensive accessories, all of which must be properly taken care of by com petent men. As a remedy for desertion, which Is "the bane and disgrace of the Army," Secretary Taft recommends a compul sory probatior*ary service, and thinks that the first enlistment should be for one year. During this time the unde sirable recruits could be weeded out and men who found that they had made a mistake in entering the army could retire from it. A more rigid examination of officers is strongly urged. Any officer who by failure in the garrison or service schools has shown his incapacity should be brought at once before a board to determine whether he is fit to continue in service, and if not to dis miss him. The Installation of the apparatus for teaching fire control and accurate aim ing, including range and position find ers, will be about $7,000,000, for which Congress has already appropriated $2, 183,200, and $1,500,000 more is asked for. The Army and Militia maneuvers were omitted last Autumn on account of lack of appropriation, but the Sec retary recommends that Congress pro vide for such exercises for the coming Fall. The organized Militia of the States and Territories aggregates now 121, 90K, of whom it Is estimated about 75 per cent would respond to a call for an emergency of invasion or insurrec tion. A marked Increase of interest in the Militia organizations has been ex hibited by the young men everywhere, and the State authorities have gener ally shown much Interest in their Mili tia and have been weeding out incom pc.tent officers and taking other steps to bring their Militia to a high state of organization and efficiency. It will surprise many to know that election corruption is more flagrant in England than in this country, in spite of all the efforts which have been made for the past half-century to eradicate the evil. It Is the worst in the seaport cities, where there is a large purchas able vote, and the candidates of both parties are equally guilty in the buy ing and selling. A very stringent cor rupt practices act was passed many years ago, but owing to the expense attending its application it is a dead letter. Before Anyone could contest an election h? myst deposit $5,000. It sometimes tfosts as much as $35,000 to gain a seait :which rightfully belongs to the contestant. The members of ParliamentJ receive no salaries, and consequently ..these great expenses are prohibitive^ Ttyey have the same trou bles that aae known in this country of a man "staying bought." In the smaller plrifceis pioney can be expended with reasonablei certainty that the man will vote as he has been paid to do, but in the larger Cities the floating element takes fill tlhv money It can get from both sides artd 'then votes or not as It pleases. 2V|r^ F. W. Oaltou, Secretary of the London Reform Union, who has spent many years iri the work of puri fying elections, says that In many places, particularly Yarmouth, the practices are worse than Tammany's. The Secretary of the Navy has re ceived a number of protests from patri otic organizations against breaking up the old frigate Constitution, which has the most glorious history of any ves sel in our Navy, arid the greatest of any single frigate in the world. She has an unbroken list of brilliant vic tories to her credit and all the time oxer the finest frigates in the world a! that time. The Secretary, has rcpli' d to the protests that he has no option In the matter, and that they must go to Congress for relief. The Germans hare made suoh a lot of noise over the adulteration In Amer ican food products, and particularly of the Inferior quality of our pork, that It oomes with a sense of almost Joy to learn that a large number of the lead ing provision dealers of Berlin are on trial for food adulteration, and the most startling developments are made as to the famous Berllnerwurst and Wienerwurst. The leading manufac turer of these delicacies, and delight of the beer saloon frequenters, was prov en to have usel all sorts of filthy and semi-decomposed fats and meats in their production, buying up for the purpose anything In the meat, butter or oleomargarine line that was offered for sale at the lowest price. Frequently when the cauldrons were emptied there was six inches of sand in their bottoms, which Included ail manner of 111th. Great quantities of these disgusting sausages were exported to the United States. Very many of the prominent provision dealers of Berlin were impli cated in this crime against the public health. The courts continue In business at the old stand, teaching a great many over-greedy financiers that honesty Is much the best policy. Judge Tayler, of the United States District Court for Eastern Ohio, overruled, last Friday, a motion for a new trial for O. L. Hayes, President of the Gallon National Bank, and sentenced him to serve seven and a half years in the Ohio penitentiary and pay the costs of pros ecution. At the same time Judge Tay ler sentenced Edward Flickinger, Pres ident of the Flickinger Wheel Co., of Gallon, for aiding and abetting in the misappropriation of the bank's funds to also serve seven and a half years In the Ohio penitentiary and pay the costs of prosecution. Seven and a half years Is an Immense period to take out of a man's active life, and when the possibilities of these are figured up it will be seen that Messrs. Hayes and Flickinger would have made a great deal more money by being honest, even if the profits were not so great at the time. Senator Gorman's troubles thicken upon him. The result of the Mary land election was a staggering blow at his leadership, and it looks as if his political ruin would be completed by the organization of the Maryland Leg islature. Gorman's leading opponents in the Democratic Party?Gov. War field, Ex-Governor Smith and Ex-Gov ernor Jackson, who have heretofore been at outs?have come into alliance a3 against Gorman and will elect Sena tor John P. Moore, of Worcester Coun ty. for President of the Senate and Richard S. Hill, of Prince George's County, for Speaker of the House. This will defeat the men whom Gorman had selected for those positions, and it Is believed will shatter his machine into cireless ruin. The annual election of directors of the Equitable Assurance Company took place last Thursday, with 13 directors elected out of the 52. There was noth ing notable In the personality of those chosen except that Sir William Mather is the representative of the British policy holders. Eleven of the 13 are new members. Sir William Mather is the head of the great Salford iron works at Manchester and a ex-member of Parliament. Among the other new di rectors are Mr. Humphreys, President of the Stevens Institute; Mr. Swan strom, ex-President of the Borough of Brooklyn and Mr. Randolph is Presi dent of the Commercial Trust Com pany of St. Louis. These were all nominated by Grover Cleveland and his co-trustees, who voted the 502 shares of stock held by Thomas F. Ryan. The Security Mutual Life Insurance Co., of Binghamton, N. Y., Is now upon the investigation gridiron and a great deal of interesting testimony is being broiled out. The first startling item is that an officer of the State Insurance Department has been upon the pay rolls of the Company as a "consulting actuary." The officers of the Company admit that they knew the man was in the State's employ when they put him on the rolls. Though President Har per of the Company has been dead some time his salary has been going on and is paid to his widow and ex ecutors, so far $134,067. Though the Germans have an nounced that they had quieted every thing in South Africa the facts are against them. They have been carry ing on a long, annoying and quite ex pensive war, which is yet far from an end, and which must necessarily take the conceit out of the Germans as to their perfect mastery of everything re lating to fighting. If they had not been so self-satisfied It would have been to their advantage to send over here for some of our old Indian fighters to teach them a few tricks of the trade. Bird S. Coler, who was elected Pres ident of the Borough of Brooklyn for a four years' term, announces a new rule in politics. He says that of the 85,000 voters who elected him 83,000 cared nothing for squabbles between leaders and would-be leaders in the different party organizations. There fore, he proposes to regard as para mount the wishes of the 83,000 and care little for those of the 2,000 poli ticians and place-hunters. If he sticks to this line of action people will be talking about him as a Presidential possibility. Though the Democratic Party In the House is small enough in all conscience to be thoroughly united and harmoni ous, it is not so, and a rebellion is fo menting against the leadership of John Sharp Williams, of Mississippi. The head and front of the rebellion will be adherents of William R. Hearst, who dt nounee Williams with "fanatical op position and personal antipathy toward Air. Hearst." They say that he Is a man of prejudices and antipathies which he allows to control him to the Injury of the well being of his party. The completed returns for Virginia give Swan son. Democrat, for Govern or, a vote of 83,544 and 45,795 for ludge Lewis, his Republican compet itor, making Swanson's plurality 37, <10. Last year Parker received 80,648 ot?s In Virginia to 47,880 for Roose < It and 1,3S3 for Swallow, making barker's plurality 32,768. ?Olf? OP

George S. Gels, Aid-de-Camp and Past Senior Vice Commander-in Chief. The reception was attended by 300 members of the Sons of Veterans and other organizations, including the G.A.R. and W.R.C. MaJ. Gels and Mra Drake gavs interesting accounts of their visit to the Encampment and the his torical battlefield. It is pointed out that the tariff on hides cannot make any substantial dif ference In the price of shoes. Only 23 per cent of the imported hides pay any duty. These are the cow hides from which heavy boots and shoes are made, and they pay a duty of only 15 per cent. A pair of coarse shoes made of cowhide weighs about two pounds, making the duty on them about three cents. On the Douglas shoe, which sells for $3.50, the duty amounts possi bly to Ave cents. The hides from which shoes are made for women and children psy no duty. The leather required to make a set of harness weighs about 12 pounds, making the duty 18 cents. There has been a great increase In the price of leather lately, largely due to the demand for leather made by Japan for the use of her army in the Orient. The strongest argument has been that the beef trust was mainly benefited by the tariff on hides, but this has been shown to be untrue, since green hides are everywhere commanding a price of about 10 cents a pound more than they did a year or so ago. There Is not a little Jealousy among South American Roman Catholics as to j representation in the highest council of the Church. There has been no Cardi | nal in America south of the United States on account of these Jealousies, but recently it was reported that the Archbishop of Rio Janeiro, Brazil, would be created a Cardinal. Argen tina claims a similar recognition, be cause of her good relations with the Church; Chile, because the Archbish opric of Santiago is the oldest in South America, and Peru, because she was the first country on the Continent where a ^oman Catholic hierarchy was estab lished. The Vatican has placated these aspirants for the time being by an nouncing that in future the Cardinals for Latin America will be chosen in turn from those countries, and includ ing Mexico. Gov. Pennypacker, on behalf of the State of Pennsylvania, accepted, Dec. 9, 1905, the monument to the 109th Pa. which has been erected on Orchard Knob, near Chattanooga. There was quite a large attendance at the cere monies, which were opened by Col. Fred L Glmber, of the 109th Pa., read ing a history of the organization. Then Capt. George W. Skinner, of the Penn sylvania Commission, transferred the shaft to the Governor, who accepted It In a fine speech and turned the monu ment over to the Government in the person of Gen. E. A. Carman. The music was furnished by the band of the 12 th U. S. Cav., and a squadron of that regiment escorted the Governor and his party. PERSONAL A great event in the history of veg etarianism was the golden wedding, at Brankford, near Philadelphia, on Wed nesday evening, Nov. 15, of the Rev. Henry. S. Clubb, President of the Veg etarian Society of America, and his wife. It is claimed for him that he has been a vegetarian longer than any other man known, especially in this ?nI5ntho; kh? now ln h!s 78th year and has been a vegetarian ever since year8 ?,d- except for the time that he was in the army.
