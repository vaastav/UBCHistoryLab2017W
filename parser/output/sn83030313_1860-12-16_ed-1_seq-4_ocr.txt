All hi-?t try, h >wever teaches n* that when a fre t revolutionary i lei is once under it strong practical headway, it must run its course. This, then, in our present position, North atH South. We are under the pressure of a great revolution, which must run its course. But we may still direct it to the ends of peace, or t reunion and harmony, or push it to the dread excesses of incurable divisions and perpetua war. Peaceably or otherwise, the day for a definite understanding upon this slavery que tion has come, and it cannot any lung r bo post poned. Our most reliable advices from Washing t<>n assure us that all hopes still entertained in the North ot a new compromise with the South within the Union lire fallaci >u<; th.it Smith Carolina, within the next tea days, wi'l rarely declare herself absolved from any fur ther allegiance to or connection wi h our fede ral government; th.it four other, or five "cotton States," before the expiration of the month ol January, w ill have followed her example; and that, probably, the first month of Mr. Lincoln's administration will mark the uniou of the South in a Southern confederacy. The controlling impression in favor of this movement is, ih.it the unbroken co operation of the Southern State* in it will prevent all thought of violence. And what then? A per manent, independent Southern confederacy? This would be the most natural inference; but sagacious and hopeful men infoim usth.it then, and only then, will the work of reconstruction begin In this work of reconstruction, bow ever, we are told that the South never will con sult to a reunion with the New England States. They are to be left where they desire to be ? released tn-m all copartnership responsibilities in reference to the institution ol slavery - in the tull enjoyment of LloyJ Garrison's ulti matum "No union w.th slaveholders." W.th the six New England States thus cut off the South, in their new Union, will h >!d a bal won o* power in the Senate, wfci, h. tinder an expla natory amendment or so to the federal c M?t|> t ition as it stand , will give them all the secu rities required for the future protection of .Southern slavery. When theorle- of reorganization such as this are seriously entertained among the m >*t con servative minds in Congress, our real -rsw.U c >ui prebend the emergencies of the day. We do uot recognise the probability of this iodi c .ted plan of reconstruction. We incline, ra ther, to the opinion that once out of this Union | in a confederacy to themselves, the South m ^?a'c* cannot be reclaimed. If the Uni >n (hen I is to be restored and ree "nstructi d. th.' ta<k in v dv ?d must be undertaken a! once, a 1 1 with a tull i< cognition, on all side*, of the new cjii c?-ssions required to render this undertaking successful But what ground of hope it ther for any such thing? Mr. Lincoln, the President elect, continue* incredulous of danger. Ilis party leaders in Congress are defiant: his pir tv organs, with here and there an exception procl lim ihe penalties of treason against South ern disunionM*. and art; incensed that Mr Buchanan hesitates to Crush them with the strong arm of federal authority In all thi? there is nothing like conciliation. The republican party will not be bullied. Oh! no Ruth r thun abandon their untenable po sition- on the slavery question they will perish where they stand What is the Union com pered with their principles? Mr. Senator Hale -*>s substantially, that if th- South try neces - it r against the triumph and enforcement of h< s< principle", th re will b ? war, and. he says, let it be war! Thus the condition of thing" tij tin us is revolutionary ami tenrf illy menae in^.- What are we of th< North to do* Whit are 'h- fort -hadowed consequence to this city fri in a Southern confederacy? Some say we can ?let*, h the city from the State, and declare it a fr? fit* and a free port. Hut this idea Is ab surd. f"r the Mate authority covers the city, and it is a sovereign authority. The city must stand or fall with the ?tate. The best that the people of the North, in cluding our fellow dtfam? of New York, city and State, can do, I* to prepare f ?r the w >r?L The cbanc* are all against the Union: that when Mr. Lincoln come* into power he will And several States out off from the Union by Htate action; that be will attempt coercion; that he will thus drive thf r? ?t of the Southern States out of the Union, and that, perhaps, be may then pursue b;? policy of coercion into a widespread civil war. We know that the calamities of disunion, even short of civil war, will bring general dis tress upon all the country.

This fanatical spirit seems to have been transmitted in the blood of the Puritans, and ii (vi ii . nan a throughout New England and on e parts of the North.

Without doubt t!iij tendency of the pulpit ha? aided greatly in the ubolitioni/ ing of the North. The people of New Kngland are naturally a pious God-fearing, pi ay log and preuching race.

W. Kimball believed tha' the people might be prayed out of their did cnlty. and proceeded to do hi* pari of th. wo'k. A colored brother, nair-*d J01. ?*, prayed that ' God will r> dees us frotn the oarsed in sti on of slavey." A white brothi r was much exercised about the peoj ie of the South on I prs 1 that they might be endowed with "prudem and that our ruler* might "be blessed with wisdom." of i a. '1 they verily stand in sore n> ed. Mr. Ri'v, v made a few Te rm tks, embodying th? very pertinent suggej tion that they were there not merely to pray for others but for themselves, anil for the cur ing of their own sins. He had "suffered every thing but death from that institution" (slavery), but bad taken it easy. A colored man. nam?! Byas, believed that Christ's hani was in the work of &e anti -slavery party, and there woul l be no peace until there was a change, H * (Byas) would "meet them on the morning of the resurrection and tell them all about it" The Rev.

Mr. Kirk had beeitftted about Coming to the meeting for fer.r that he Bight disagree with some of the brethren on the subject of slavery, bnt "h wm rejoiced to Cod that others thought as he did. snd he must speak his mind."

Tiu* gentle shepherd vu not to fce gagged by the South, and he wound up with a "fer vent prayer for the slave" and for '-our rulers," putting the slave first. Perhaps the Kev. Mr. Stockbridge referred to Kirk when he prayed "for the restraint of those who would uu wisely irritate the feelings of any one," and perhaps not At any rate the meeting adjourned in lather an agreeable state of mind, singing the eld f'u?liioned Puritan anthem, ''Coronation." We are very much inclined to doubt the (fflr.icy of the prayers of people who have dono their beet to pull down tin' thrine, and now profess a certain degree of pious anxiety that the ediflco they have helped to undermine may yet stand firm. Doubles, they all agreed in their hearts with Kirk, wh?> d- serves a certain degree of rospect for consis tency, however untrue he may be to his mission as a preacher of the Word which is founded i ] on the cardinal principle, '"peace on earth, j. cod will to men." The Scriptures tell us that l:e prayer ot the righteous man avalleth much, but there ure also some pungent allusions to ll e Pharisees, who pray at the corners of th? tilled*- and say lo their fellow man.

'1 he opinion of Att<^y General itluck in reply to the ((rave qfl^fion-' propounded to him by the President appeared in Monday Hbi ai i?, and doubtless him been perused by iu(. t ol our readers. It is an argument of irre tftH'ble force, nnd it appears that it was on this exposition of constitutional law that the 1 resi dent founded that portion of his Me-sa<?e in which he discusses the question of secession, and the alleged right of the federal government t<> prcvt nt or remedy it by force of arms. 1 be Attorney General officially declares th.it nei th< r to the President nor to Congress doe* th" constitution grant, either expressly or by im plication. the right to make war against one or more of the States. The federal governtn -nt' wur making power under th'- constitution is li mit- d to repelling foreign invasion, and it can call forth and use thy of the Stii'c for that purpose. It cannot enter a .St.it a for the purpose of carrying on hostilities against it. It is true that it is authorized to suppress insurrection against a State, but that is only when it is invited to do so by the Legislature of the State, or by its Governor when th'- Le gislature is not in session. The case of tho Whiskey insurrection in the western counties of Pennsylvania in 1794. ha? been referred to by republican journals a< analogous to the case of South Carolina. Hut the two cases are entirely different. It w^ with the concurrence and active assistance of th< Governor and Legislature of Pennsylvania, and part of the militia of the Slate, that the federal government put down th<* rioters who r.-isteil the execution of the Kxclse laws. To wage war against a whole sovereign S at.- is a very different affair. In the second w.*r with Ikjglaud, when the brave militia of Ken ueky and Tennessee marched fifteen hun Ired miles to New Orleans, where they won a victory without a parallel in the history of war, th ? Stetes of Massachusetts, Connecticut and Ithod > Island declined to furnish the quota of militia de manded by President Madison, and the Supreme Court of Massachusetts sustained them on the ground that the Governors of States, and nut the President, were to judge of the exigency for call ing them out. And y.i the leaders or th- republi can party, which is predominant in th ' New Kngland States, now talk of sending to invade sister States, the militia which was refused when it was needed for the constitutional and pa triotic purpose of repelling British invasion. One of the objects of the Union, as declared in the preamble to the constitution, is to "in sure dome-tic tranquillity." To employ the forces of some of the States to invade other States would be a strango mode of accomplish ing that object. In the words of the Attorney General, such an act - wouM absolve all the Suioe from their federal obligation* for to ??hold equal States as subjugated province would totally de-troy the whole theory upon which they are now connected," and "the Union mu-t utterly perish at the moment when Congress shall arm one part of the people Against another." Suppose the invaders suc ceeded. could they by coercion compel a State to >end Senators or representative to Congress ortojo.nin the election of a President* The attempt to force revolting State* back into the Union would be like bringing n horse to .he wa'er which we could not compel him to drink, or a man whipping his wife to compel her to live with him. and love him. after she had left him for bad treatnu t. It Is only by concilia tion. therefore, that there can be any hope of restoring a seceding State. The Attorney General give* his opinion abcul the collection of the revenue aul the protection of the federal property, but he doe? no' -nv anything ab>ittt the Post Office. How is that difficulty to be mot? How are the United Mate- mails to be got over ihe line of a ^ceding and ho-tilo State? From the President's Message, and from the ,.{?!? ,n>t his legal adtiser. i. is evident Mr. i n I anan will n t ? tnploj f< rce against th-' .-'tine of Scuth Car.'luM, or any other se, <- li-^ Stu-e. He will, for the present. u?o merely uc:i force as is necessary to collect the rcve nu? at Chail-?t"ti k* l..ng ?? any civil f. d- ral mth rily exists tle-re control it; but if th-' (??? , . fBC' * f snoot be filled, and tie re i- in> icliral Judge. Hist net Attornev or Mirnhal then "troops would certainly be out of place, ami their use wh >lly illegal." In a i?. c ?* ? they would act only on the defensive, in \ ro tce'iiig the federal property or the prop.-r ers in the collection of the revenue. rhi* Mr. Pucbanan proposes to do as far as the means at his disposal are adequate, "until * new order of things shall be established, f'ther by law or force." In other words, till CorgreM relieves him by law in acknowledg ing the independence of South Carolina, or t that State brings sufficient force to overwhelm the small federal force, and taks possession o the forte and harbor. But according to the latent intelligence from Charleston, South Carolina does not intend to resist the coll ation of th** revenue during Mr. Buchanan's adminis tration, and till she is in a position from con c<>rt with the other seceding Stat?? to maintain her independence by force. 1 he Southern States will therefore secedo, and remain to seee-wion during the administra tion of Mr. Buchanan, without any resistance on his part. But from all that wo can learn {ton the organ* ftad louden of republican party, as soou as Lincoln c >mes lato power on the 4th of March he will wage war against the seceding States, and thus u >t only break up the whole Union, but prevent the possibility oi it* reconsructtion on any terms. Thk Dtbtoms ui Kansas ? Prowcts oh Kk PtmuOAK PoiJCT. ? A few evenings since a min ing was held in the Cooper Institute tor the re lief of the suffering people of Kansas, and a goodly sum of money was raided for that pur pose. The charity and benevolence of New York are proverbial; no appeal to the sympathy of its citizens is ever made in vain. There can be no doubt that the people of Kansas are in great destitution ? in absolute need of food? and it is but right that their claim for assist ance should meet a response such as has been accorded to them. But what are the causes from which their present di.-'.re-? has sprung? It is due entirely to the course which the re publican party have chosen to pursue with re ga rd to that Territory, for purely political pur poses. The republican party, by means of emigrant aid societies, Beocher's sermons, Sharp's rifles and other exciting agencies, poured a host of emigrants, numbering some thirty or forty thousand, into Kansas for the avowed purpose of excluding slavery from a Territory which the edict of God has declared can never exist there- which the laws oi nature, governing soil, and climate, und geographical po-ition. have pronounced impossible there und they ha\e done this to build up a political party, and raise up issues upon an abstraction, to defy and embarrass the administration, and to gain power .uid importance for thcmelves. The Territory of Kaosa-1 therefore i- to-day over ccn.e with a population tar beyond its re sources to maintain, u population, too. which, unfortunately for theuwelv es in this exigency, devoted more time to political broils and civil discord than to the cultivation of the land. It is no wonder th^n that Lunger and distress reign in Kansas. Put it happens tha' the very same party, nn<i the pursuance of the same policy which brought about this state of things in Kansas, und have reduced its inhabitant* to the neces sity of appealing to the sympathies of their brethren in the States, and even of that admi nistration which they went out there to deride and damage, ii*tve at this moment spread dis tress and panic throughout iii? whole breadth of the land. It is the action of the republican party which has arrested the course of trade, cat: -ed all the material interests of the country to depreciate to tl e amount of six hundred millions of dollars, the factories to cease work, to turn out hungry into the streets of this metropolis and the other commercial and manu facturing cities of the Union thousands of operatives, with hungry families looking up to them for bread; to disorganize every system and destroy ?rery interest i~ the entire repub lic, the recovery of which no man can see. It is not to the thirty or forty thousand sufferers alone in tie Territory of Kansas that the policy of the republican party has brought vant and lunger and embarrassment, but to thirty millions of people in the United States. It is cot the Kansas people alone who will have to look to the charitable and benevolent for assistance, but millions of unemployed poor in our oun cities and towns, before this dreary wiuter is past. Not a Et d ok Kohks.- It is . id that Mr. Bu ci.nuiin, a yesr ago or more, iu a conversation with a friend or two upon the suicidal squab bles of the demoralized democracy, declared that he was counting thedaysto the day of hi* deliverance from the incessant cares and bur dens of his laborious otfice. No one then supposed him to be resting upon a bed of roses; but who it there, among our ambi tious politicians, who would voluntarily change places with him now? Ills Secretary of the Treasury, anticipating the secession of Georgia from the Urion, anu pleading his para mount allegiance to his State, resign- hi- po-t and his successor comes i-itc his phce oiily to find that the Treasury U literally empty, and ov< t head and ears in debt. Mr. Bach.*.:) ui dis mi- sen Air. Cobb with regret; but no sooner is thl- vacancy filled than the old Nestor of the Cabinet, General Cass, delivers up Ins port folio as Secretary of State. The reason for his retirement is reported to be the refusal of Mr. Buchanan to strengthen the garrison of l ot t Moultrie, at Charleston. Ncr is this all. Uni'iors arc abundant of the resignation, and tl? contemplate resignation of Secretary '1 h< nij Hin, of the Department of the Interior, auubecau. e the President has ordered, or is ab< ut to older, a ship of war to Charleston. V ho can envy Mr. Buchanan lu? undesirable n amenabilities ?nd difficult?** at this crisis? Hut believing him to be right in his opinion thu. conciliation, and not coercion, is the pro pet policy to be pur-ucd towards the South, including South Carolina we say let him stand I i- *r< und and a*oi?l gunpowder to the l.i?t exMinity. The republican party are usiug theii utmost energies to lompcl him to break ground for them in their policy of coercion.
