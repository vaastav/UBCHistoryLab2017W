Pedro Carrlllo. who was sitting on a bench in front of the sa loon, was also Killed by a stray bullet from Devance's pistol. The principals In the tragedy had a quarrel some time ago that came near resulting in n gun duel, but the quarrel was patched up and no more trouble was anticipated. According to reports, the shooting Sunday night resulted from a state ment by the deceased to the effect that Devance was part negro. It 13 said that when Devance was Informed of this statement, he armed himself, went into the saloon, and finding stately shaft will record his genius and what Is wrought, and from the shades of a century's oblivion James Wilson will emerge the prophet of a new dispensation.

Tip to a late hour tonight nothing confirmatory of the Clifton disaster has been re-1 celved, except private dispatches sent I from one friend to another.

Now that the great event between O'Brien and Burns Is over and followers of the game have had time to talk it over, they are turning their attention to the next event which Is another champion ship battle. TW l tho Attell-TValsh contest which will take place in the Pacific Athletic Club Pavilion on the night ot Friday. December 7th. The worst quibbler In the world could not say anything to show that the winner of this event will be absolutely the feather-weight champion of the world. Abe Attell won this title when he de feated Neill decisively last Fourth of July, with the title he also won the T. J. McCarey championship 'lelt, which goes with the title and -will go Into the possession of the wljner of this battle. Everybody In the Southwest knows all about .Abe Attell. He has boxed so many times In Los Angeles, that fol lowers of the game have grown ac quainted with his record and his mar velous cleverness. Attell is one of those plucky men who is not afraid of such as Battling Nelson, Herrera and Kid Herman and has usually come off with the decision. His recent batle with Harry Baker, the little worffier from San Franclco. Is fresh In the mind of the public and everybody concedes that for an ex position of clever boxing. It was with out an equal in the history of the ring. Jimmy Walsh Is not so well-known in the West His best work has been done in England, where he obtained a draw" with Jem Bawker, the British wonder, who was defeated by Nelll He toured the United Kingdom, meeting all comers In his class and defeated every single one or them. Walsh ha already met Abe Attell this year. On Washington's birthday he went fifteen rounds with the pres ent champion at Chelsea, Mass., but lost the decision. He Is quite young, however, being only twenty years of age, and hagr naturally Improved since that time, so that we must all con cede that Walsh has an excellent chance to trie the championship belt Into hls""possesslon.

The Standard says the most signifi cant feature of the messice is that the president Is constantly finding himself "up against" the American constitu tion. The Dally Express finds the mes sage a strong demonstration of the fact that the main currents of nation al life in England and America are weeping forward In parallel lines, namely. tEe struggle of nationalism against anti-nationalism, and of the state against socialism. 

HAVANA. Dec. 4. The message of President Roosevelt to the American congress was published in the local press this afternoon. No editorial comment on it was made. The Liberal and Moderate leaders are chary of expressing an opinion of the president's declaration regarding a Cuban policy. The general view, however, la that it does not differ ma terially from statements made In the letter of Senor Quesada, Cuban minis ter, last September, and the final de termination of the policy of the Unit ed States rests In the hand of con gress. The Diarlo De La Marina tomorrow win aay; "While President Roosevelt's decla rations relative to Cuba are In fact a pharaphrase of hit letter to Senor Qaesada, the message contains the ad' rational statement that If Cnba ac asdras the revolutionary habit it Is Im possible that the Island's Independence rhould be maintained, for since the TJeHsd Mates is standing in the posi ties, of a guarantor of protection cj life and property, it weald then be compelled to lsterrese anew.
