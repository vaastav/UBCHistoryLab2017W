TI1E LAST CHAMOIS, The second Bctsion of the Forty'Seventh Congress assembled in Washington on loft Monday. Tho Democrats Dave a luejority in both branches of the present Congress, but after the fourth of March next tho Re publicans will have a plurality in the low;r House, the Independents and Grccnlmrkers holding the balance of power, with tin? probability that on all political questions they will atlllinte with the Republicans. If the Senate should bc Republican, that party will have control of tho Federal government for thc next two yeara. It is not probable that any measures of a partisan character will bc drought before thc present Congress, ami it is more than likely that thc present session will be eminently practical and de voted to thc consideration of mensures pro motive of the general interests of the whole country. Tho tariff and revenue laws ncad revision, and now when tho country und Congress rest from nil iioliticnl excitement is thc time for statesmen of both parties to give to the country a just and equal tarin", ono which shall protect thc industries of thc country alike without unjust discrimi nation *in favor of any industry < .-against nny class of consumers, and one which ut Die same time shall rnlsc thc largest amount of revenue, mid thereby enable Congress to reform and reduce th? Internal Revenue taxation. If the Democratic party in this tho last session of its supremacy in both branches ol Congress shall secure to thc country a sound currency, ignoring repudi ation and arcenbackism, adopt a tariff for revenue, and at the same Mme have regard to a just protection uf iL^. industrial inter I ,?s of the country, and so reform the Inter nal Revenue taxes that they shall not oper ate unjustly against the industries of limited portions of the country, it will receive the commendation of all sections and parties. PKESII?ENT*8 MESSAGE. Piosident Hayes on Inst Monday com municated to both Houses of Congress bis last annual message. It ls quito lengthy, and if lt wero not for thc roconi iHerniation of a nev crusade against tho South which ItcontniiiB, would strike tho publie ns containing suggestions emi nently wiso and national. Tho President assumes that "continued opposition to tho full nnd freo onjoymont of tho rights of citizenship, conferred upon tho colored people by tho recent amendments to the Constitution, still prevails in suvoral of tho lato alaveholdlng States," and asks C??grf?? to pass lirai sud well considered measures to enforce tho Fifteenth Amend ment, which means that [[tho Federal Government shall control all Federal elections in tho Southern States. Thc President further recommends tho House of Rcpreacntotlves and the Senate to BCO to it that every caso of tho violation of tho letter or spirit of thc Flftcontb Amend ment is thoroughly investigated, and that no bencllt from such violation shall neerim to any porson or party, which means that tho next Congress shall cx cludo .snell members nf Congress und Senators as tho Republicans may deem expedient. Tho President further asks Congress for sulliciont appropriations to irosecuto unsparingly all who havo boon engaged in depriving citizens of tho rights guaranteed to them by tho Consti tution. Whatever may be tho merits cf tho rcmaiudor of the Message, this por tion of it is n dark .spot which mais tho whole, and identities tho President witli tho H'alwarth elem-, ut of his parly, and that instead of necking at tho closo of his administration to heal all sectional feel ings, it is his desire to kindle afresh tiio fires of sectional hate and animosity.
