As tlio question lias been raised us to what town In the United Stales may claim to bo tlio "banner town" in tlio lato Presi dential election, It may bo well to repeat tlio Information that there were several towns In Vermont that gavo only ono oto against the Republican nominees, whllo hx wore unanimous for Orantand Wilson. Thoso unanimous towns wcro Panlon, Mcndon, Coventry, L,emlngton, Morgan and Westmore. Among tho acts passed by the Legisla ture at Its recent session Is a general law providing that freight wagons carrying more than threo Ions In weight, and loss than four, shall have tlio rims or felloes of their wheels at least four inches wide, and if carrying moro than four tons, llvo inch es. Tho law does not apply to v, agons used for farming purposes oxclusUely, nor to stage coaches nor plcasuro wagons; and the selectmen of any town may In their discretion allow tho use of felloes of less width, provided in their opinion the high ways will not be gicatly injured thereby. Tlio cumulative system of voting appears to work well in Illinois, wiiero it was tried iu the recent election of State Representa tives. By tho scheme threo candidates are died for In every legislative district, and everv voter has three votes which he cither distributes among tho diflcicnt candidates, or cumulates tiion one. The House oi RepicsontatUos thus elected is found to represent in Its composition precisely tho proportions of political parties lu tlio Stale Tho proportion of republican to democratic members is bO to 07. Had the reprcsenta lives been, boweer, elected in tho ordlu arv method, the proportion would have been DO republicans to M democrats, that is the republicans would havo had 20 epiesentatlves than their numerical to say, more repi superiority entitled them to, and a eorios ponding proportion of democratic votors would have been deprived of any represen tation whatever. Tho election of tho Illi nois Senate, which was effected lu tho old fashion, resulted In 33 republicans and 18 democrats; vvhorcas aecordiug to the nu merical population of tho parties ill the state, there should have lieen about i!3 re publicans to 2 democrats. If thejust rep lesentatiou of tlic people is the object of our legishitlvo bodies, surely there can bo no answer to such figures as these. co.xaitnnN. The special committee of the republican senators to make up the standing commit tees, has classed the Greeley republicans with the democrats. It Is tho custom for tho majoilty In tho Scualo to leave one or two placos, as Iho case may be, at the foot ol each committee, uuassigned, for the members of the minority, and to allow the minority to designate the names of those to ho assigned to theso places. According ly tho Greeley republicans have been drop ped in making up tho committees, and they and the democrats must arrange a mong themselves how the positions shall bo shared between them. If any of theso liberals rcfuso to bo classed with tho dem ocrats and to act with them, they aro liko ly lo get no committee appointments at all. Trumbull is left oil' tho judiciary commit tee, Kenton off the contingent expenso, finance, and Pacific railroad committees, Tipton oil' tho public lauds and pension committees, Schurz off tho committee on foreign iclatlous, Spraguo off tho appropri ations committee, and Rico off tho mines and mining committee. Senator Kdmuuds of Vermont becomes chairman of tho judiciary committee lu tho Senate by the retirement of Mr Trumbull. Mr Sumner, at his own request, Is not as signed lo any position. Mr. Morrill Is chairman of tho Senato Committee on Pub lic Buildings and Grounds, and Is second in tho Commltteo on Finance. Judgo Po land has been appointed chairman of the Investigating commltteo raised by the Houso to Inquire Into the charges made a gainst Kpeakor Blalno and other members of Congress, In relation to tho Credit Mo blller matter. The resolutions of the Vermont Legisla ture In referenco to civil service reform and the franking privilege were presented to tho national House of Representatives, Monday. Among tho bills Introduced in the House is ono authorizing the Incorporation of a United Statos Bank, with a capllal ol $100,. 000,000 and ono giving the widow of Gen. Meado (2,000 a year. A bill allowing a drawback on all material imported for and actually used lu rebuilding tbe burnt dis trict iu Boston, and also on such classes of goods in warehouses on the day of the fire, was passed unanimously, A bill has been Introduced In Iho .Senate fur tho adjustment and apportionment of thu Alabama award. This Is to be douo by u board of threo commissioners uud a sec ictary, Iu tho House a bill was passed a hollshlnglheolucesor assessor and assistant ussessor, on the first of July, 1673. This provides for u saving In the expenses of collecting tho revenue, of about three mil lion of dollars a year, Mr, Banks of Massachusetts, offered res olutions fixing tho salary of the President at ?50,pSo per annum, commencing March, 1873 ) that the term of olllco of the Presi dent and vicj president be six years, the President tn bo Inelliglblo lor re-election, and that tho President uud vice president be eleclcd by tho people at tho Name time that congressmen are elected. Bills have been Introduced piovldlng for safety bonds ; to reduce the taxes; repeal Jpg Iho usury m-tlon of the currency act ; amending tho postal acts; providing for tho collection of statistics of tho Inland and coast vvlso trado between tbe blnlcs ; repeal ing tho bankruptcy act repealing tho spe cial tax on retailers of leaf tobacco ; repeal ing tho enforcement act; abolishing tho stamp duty on bank checks) repealing tho Iron-clad oath, etc. On Thursday, Mr. Morrill of Vermont took tho floor 111 favor of tho bill which ho lnlroiluccd last year for tho further endow ment of Agricultural Colleges. Under tills bill tho additional land grants proposed do not lutorfcro witli tlio homestead act, and cannot be purchased in larger masses by speculators, but the lands aro to bo held lu custody by tho United States until actually sold to (ho extent of half a million acres, for n national college In each Stale and Territory ; and when Rold tho amount, de ducting oxpensos, is to bo invested in U. S. llvo per cent bonds, to bo held by tho Treasurer of the United Statos for tho ben efit of each of tho colleges, and interest paid thereon semi-annually. This will not bo Inconvenient to tho gnucrnmcnt, and will at tho samo time glvo tho highest security to the colleges. Doyoud this tlio United States will obtatn and retain n lien upon tho funds practically enfoicoablo to compel u compliance with tho conditions of the original land grant as well us of Ihoso of tlio present amendment. The funds can never be squandered nor misapplied. It may be somo years before tho full amount of this grant will bo realized, but In tho end it will give an annual Incomo to each Institution of not less than $30,000, which will bo enough to plaeo them on a solid foundation of assured success. The llouso has decided to lake n recess from Friday, December 20, to Monday, January C. tiW.KCTOIl.tl. COLLIiflK. The Presidential Klcctors met in the va rious States on Tuesday of last week and cast their voles for President and Vlco President. It Is a startling and extraor dinary coincidence of events that upon the samo day, and almost at tho samo hour, tho electoral voto should bo cast and the funer al obseques of Mr. Oreeley tako place. Tho Vermont Electoral College met at the olllco of tho Secretary of State, In tho Cap ital at Montpoller, Tuesday evening, and organized by the choico of Hon. Harmon Canlicld, of Arlington, as President, and Romeo H. Stall, of llurllugton, as Sccro- tary, and then adjourned until Wednesday morning, when they rc-asscmblcd and cast tho live electoral voles of Vermont for Ulysses S. CIrant of Illinois for President, and Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, for Vice-President of tho United States. lion. Rllsha P. Jcwelt, of Montpoller, tho senior member of the college, by years, was elect' ed the messenger to carry the certificate of votes to Washington. In Maryland, Sena tor Hendricks was nominated for Presi dent, and recolved tho cntlro vote. Ten ncssec pursued tho shiiio course, making In all 20 voles for Hendricks. Iu Georgia, (Jralz Brown leecived 0 voles for President, Horace Greeley 3, and Charles J. Jenkins 1 ; for Vico President, Gratz Drown receiv ed 3, Gen. A. II. Colquit of Georgia 5, and Gen. Banks 1. Gratz Brown also received the 20 voles of tho first two mentioned States for Vice President. Botli sets of lectors In Arkansas voted for President and Vlco President. Tho Governor declar cd tho Grant electors clioxon, but tho Gree ley candidates are sure thev have tho real majority, and acted as Iflhey thought they could prove it. They gavo their votes to 0ra,z B,own for President and Gen. Banks fur vic0 President. In Loulsana, too, both pels or electors will probably vote. Iu Missouri the Giceley elector gavo 8 votes to Gralz Blown for President, C to Hen dricks, and 1 to Judgo Davis and Julian. Gov. Palmer and Mr. Groe-beek got tho votes for VK-o President thai went to Brown for tho flint office. Giving Louisiana and Arknnsas to Grant, his electoral voto stands at 300, and tho opposition GO. The full lopular void In all but two of tho smaller states foots up, Grant 3,188,4!5, Greeley 2, S20,32tl. The full returns will carry tho fig ures up to say 3,500,000 and 2,750,000, or 700,000 majority for Grant in an aggregate of six millions and quarter. Tin: Liquoit Law, Two nets, amenda tory of, and In addition to the "Prohibitory Law," so called, wcro passed by the Lcgls latuie. The more Important of these will add considerably to the stringency of the law. Heretofore It has been not uncom mon for a person to bo prosecuted over and over again, receiving In each caso only con viction and punishment for a "first offenno." Hereafter it will bo the duly of Iho proso cutlng officers lo mention and niako proof of any pievlous convictions, and of tho courts to iullict iu ull cases of repeated con victions Iho Increased penalties provided for second and third offences. Further moio liquor cses will liercallcr tako pre cedence of other trials In court, oxceptlng only criminal cases In which soino respon dent is under urrost, uud no continuance or noire prosequi will bo allowed, except when In tho opinion of tho court or prose cuting officer, tlio cuds of justice require It. It is plain that If this statute is "lived up to," the ways of transgressors against the liquor law, will bo mado considerably har der than they havo been. The other act permlls no witness on u li quor case, except tlio man who Is on trial, to bo excused from testifying on the ground that his testimony may criminate himself, Theso ai ls ore significant of thu lomper of tho Legislature and of tho determination of the State to tako no steps towards license or relaxation, in tho mutter of tho sale of liquor. Tho action on the Stalo constabu lary bill was qulto as significant. Two years ago tho bill providing for a Stato po lice found few advocates, and received but I'i votes In tho Houso. This year tho samo bill passed the llouso by u strong majority, 162 to L0, and probably only fulled in Iho Senate, because it reached that body too lato In the session to allow of the necessary discussion and consideration. Burlington Free Press. Tun PnEsmEST's rowciis. Tho simple question Is, how aro we to hold the Ad ministration responsible for Its own follies and sins, and not for thoso of Congress ; and how wo are to mako Congress, In Its turn, responsible fur Its own. It Is lo bo observed here, that, by tho thoory of tho Constitution, the Kxecutivo lias very little responsibility compared with Congress. In our popular politics, slnco Andrew Jack son's time, wo talk us if the Kxecullvo had Iho w hole. Hut tho men who mado the Constitution meant to cut tho President's claws, and tlio his teeth, very closely, Tliey meant that he should do what Congress bade him do, whether ho liked it or no. On their theory, then it was comparatively lit tle consequence whether tho views of the Departments and of tho President vveru or woro not represented distinctly In Con gress, Ono of tlio real questions now bo foro the country Is, whether wo mean to go on with the theory of tho Constitution, or with Gen, Jackson's counter-theory, In which the President represents tlio peoplo directly, uud Is therefore responsible for the success or failure of everything. On this thoory he governs Congress, Just us lie commands the Army and the Navy. And this Is undoubtedly tho popular theory with tho American press and tho American peo ple. Hide by aide with this question thero has grown up, almost by accident, a sim ilar question, from which will spring many conflicts boforo It Is answered, Tho Senate, lu Andrew Johnson's days, attatnod power never dreamed of iu the Constitution.

Tho proposition now receiving so much attention, viz., Hint tho President bo chos en by a direct voto of tho people, was vot ed down in tho convenllou which adopted tho federal constitution.

Accompanying this elegant pros- cut was a slip of paper containing these words : To pay for the buckled shoes.

WUITIEH rOHTlIK VKUMONT riliXNIX. IIO.tllltl.Xl3 .lllOV.XU. Wo had hoped, when our Legislature passed the law that every school district in the State should board tlio teacher on tho grand list, and not on tho scholar, that that laborious, man-killing practice of obliging teachers to boa id around, would lie forever douo away with ; but, lu this wo were dos tlncd to be disappointed. For wo see that somo districts, tn a few towns, aro requir ing their teachers to board around, on the grand list, thus obliging them to board with every family in Iho district. In most cases this has been brought about by n few men who hope to save penny or two by having tho teacher conio and board with them a few days, in room of paying their share of tho tax for hiring him boarded at ono place. Every ono admits, and thinks It noces. sary, that all professional men should havo tlmo and opportunity tn prepare for the du tlos that await them ; that the minlsler should not conio before his peoplo without having first studiously and priiyorfully preiared himself for Ids Sunday's work, anil that tho lawyer should take time to acquaint himself with his case, and thus bo nble to perform aright tho work allotted to him. Ilut lheso men, seem lo think that a teacher needs no tlmo for preparation or forethought; that ho is always going to be icady with explanations and Illustrations In all tho branches of study that his schol ars pursue, and yet, havo no opportunity for reading or Improving his mind. This opportunity he cannot havo and bo obliged to live hero ami there, In Iho district; for everybody expects "to havo a good time" visiting with tho teacher whou he shall come lu board with them, and ho may think himself well oil' if not called upon during the ovonlng, to assist somo llvo-year-old in mastering his A B C's, or to teach an older ono tho process of multipli cation. But this isn't nil. How often, lu the winter season, does tho teacher, worn and fatigued with tho labors of tho day, havo to go on foot, after school hours, ono mile or more, through Iho snow, to Ids boarding place for tho night ; and then, many times, Instead of being provided with a comforts- bio place for sleeping, bo put Inlo tho sparo bed, In tho farthest nnd coldest corner of tho house a bed that grows colder and colder through tho long hours of tho night, until tho occupant feels as If ho were en veloped In ono solid mass of Ico and bo obliged lo llo there until morning and frcczo It out, or get up, and thus disturb tho good peoplo of tho houso und bo called nn "Old Maid" lo pay for It. Wo earnestly hopo that thoso men who uro so cnlhuasllcally engaged In making arrangements for "Iho teacher" lo board nround, will lake Into consideration the magnitude of Iho bo'licr that they aro Im posing upon lilm, and that tho lime it not far distant when nil will be willing lo glvo touchers slcady boarding places. Until then, wo shall endeavor lo patient ly endure our trials, nnd feel lo say with him of olden lime, "Ituw long, O Lord, how long?" victim. .Stale run. -Alburgh is fattening 2000 goesc for Iho Christmas market.
