The public roads throughout this par ish are inl a deplorable condition. In certain localities they are said to be im passable, and the traveling public, in many instances, is driven to the neces sity of passing through tielis in order to avoid the precipices which aie 1to be encountered in almost any viiirection one may go. The prime cause of all this is neglect to work these thorough fares at the proiper timn (Or Police July should take active cteps to at onie remedly this evil ; andl one of the fiist reforms should be to put the wet king If all the roads of the parish under t he di rection of one responsible man -a road inspector should be appointted, and given a salary that would justify him in spending at least six nmonths of his time annually in having all the parish roads w oked propelly. The next step should be to secure the proper man for road inspector, and ii: this connection we will say that there is one man in the parish who wo4,ull make a most excellent inspector. \We refer to Mr. Diomel Durio who is an aic tive, intelligent and experienced man. We do not know if Mr. Durio woult accept such al alppointment, but in the event of his doing so, we feel confident that the public roads would very shortly be put in first-class condition. It is to4 be hoped that our pa ish fatheIr will give this matter their serious aIt tenntiotn.

The reason whisky and hogs are placed in the same category is because they are sort of twin brothers in depre dation, waste and destruction-whisky in man, and tlhe hogs in the fields. But let it be observed that, in this duo, whisky is put in the lead because he is so much the bigest and strongest ox in the team that is dragging our parish so fast to poverty and ruin. And we want to stop him everywhere, and the other only where the neighbors desire it. It is said that the antis are telling the more ignorant of the colored people that, if they vote for Prohibition, they will not be able either to get whisky to drink, or hog-meat to eat. But all of the colored people are not fools by a good deal, and it is to be hoped that, they will not soon forget the late and serious troubles whisky caused them; and that they will not only study about the many and dreadful evils of whis key, but that they will rally with the white people and help them put a stop to it; because it is the worst enemy of all mankind, colored as well as whites, and we hope they can understood that we don't propose to slaughter the whis key and hog team yoked together. We will unyoke them, and let the parish at large slay' the huge lead ox, that is madly tearing all over the country, and plunging his horns into every body he can chase down The poor bony hogs, that rub all, summer around field fences 'hunting a crack to squeeze through and steal some man's corn or potatoes, and thus escape starvation which has reduced them to' skin and bones out on the prairie, we will let each separate neighborhood dispose of them as they may think best. Every body Iatay rest assured that vot ing for Prohibition will not interfere - itlh the hogs at all. They are two separate and distinct questions It is trtue they- are the two leading causes of the poverty and hard times that are so pinching, but they are to be disposed of separate and apart. When a man casts his vote for Prbhibition it don't touch the dear hogs at alL Unless each neighborhood sees the fset that it costs a great deal more-to let, hog run at large in the p'rairie'to ftarve while they fence against them, than it would to keep them in a pasture and .feed them on cotton seeds, and deei1e each neigh borhood for itself to shut up the hogs, they will still be allowed to run at large, even though whisky be shut up. On the contrary, if we get Prohibition the emoney that now goes to pay for whisky and the damages it causes will furnish every man in the eountry with ats much meat (and hog-meat at that if he prefers it) as he can eat; and not only that, it will add two or three lar rele of fleor, half barrel syrup, 100 lbs. coffee, *sd plenty of sugar to sweeten it with too. In the next article on these subjects -it will be- shown plainly by statistical facts and figates how every man can have plenty and live well. D. W. FPosm.

These, how ever, lie not the distinctive features of his llessage, as his introduction is, wherein, taking advantage of the fact that this is the one hundredth anniver sary of our adoption of the Federal Constitution, le reviews the condition of the country to-day, points out the dangers that menace our institutionis and utters a warning that deserves the fullest consideration. The President takes perhaps a some what too gloomy view of the situation We do not believe that the country is in as bid a condition as his diagnosis shows ; but none the less, his warning is timely and to the point, and he shows dangers ahead which cannot be detied and which we must avoid. The contest and bitterness between capital and labor, the growth and power of the trusts, the disposition to seek Federal aid for private enterprise and the Federal interference in local affairs are, lie declares existing evils that are draining the life blood of the country, building up classes in Amner ica and undermining and destroying its institutions. Most of these evils can be avoided, he points out, by a reduction in our revenue, and especially by a reduction in our tariff rates. If less money was taken from the people, and less surplus lying idle in the treasury, there would be less disposition *to appeal to the Federal government for assistance to purely local or individual .,terprises, less chance to acquire great fortunes, less opportunities for ti ists and monopolies. The President strong ly backs up his former tariff message by his last one to Congress, which Is more emphatic tha n anything else lie has had to say on the subject. Mr. Cleveland has evidently not changed his views on tlle tariff in consequence of his defeat;,jnd in probably his last public mne:jage lie warns us, in the revision of ur ta iff laws and the reduction of our revenues-the neces sity for which is now conceded by all -to see to it that the question of the direct benefit to our citizens be the chief point considered siai that no scheme be accepted as satistartory by which the burdens of the peophlle are only apparently relieved.
