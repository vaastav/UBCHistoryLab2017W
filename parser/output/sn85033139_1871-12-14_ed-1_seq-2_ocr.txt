THE PILOT. BY T. a. Till. OFFICIAL PAPER OF MANITOWOC COUHTf THURSDAY, I )EC EM BE R 1471*717 PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. Washington, Dec. 4.—The following is the President's message delivered to Con gress to-day, at noon: T<’ the ,Senate and House of Representa tives: In addressing my third annual message to the law-making branch of the Govern ment, it is gratifying to be aide to state that during the past year success has gen erally attended the efforts to execute all the laws found upon the statute books. The policy lias been not to inquire into the wisdom of laws already enacted, but to learn their fecial interest and enforce them accordingly. The past year ha. under a w ise Provi dence, ’oeen one of general prosperity to the nation. It has, however, been attend ed with more than the usual chastisements in loss of life and property by storm and fire. These disasters have served to call forth the best elements of human nature in our country, and to develops a fri n-lship for us on the part of foreign nat; >:i<. which goes far toward alleviating the dGtres* oc casioned by the calamities. The benevo lent who have so generously shared llicir means with the victims of these misfor tunes will reap their reward in the con sciousness of having performed a noble act, and in receiving the grateful thanks of men, women and children whose suffering they have relieved. 

FOREIGN RELATION-. The relations of the I'nitcd States with foreign pow ts continue to be friendly. The year lias been an eventful one in wit nessing two great nations, speaking one language, and of one lineage, settling, by pieacefnl arbitration, disputes of long stan i ing. and liable at any time to bring these nations into bloodshed and a state of con flict. An example has thus been set which, if successful in its final issue, may be followed by other civilized nations, and be the final means of returning to productive industry millions of m°n maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the bayonet and broad-sword. THE WASHINGTON*'TREATY. I transmit herewith a copy of the treaty alluded to, which has heen concluded since ' the adjournment of Congress with Her Brittanic Majesty, and a copy of the proto cols of the conference of the Commission ers by whom it was negotiated. This treaty provides methods fir adjust ing the questions pending between the two nations. Various questions are to tie ad justed by arbitration. 1 recommend to Congress, at an early day, to make the ne cessary provisions for the tribunal at Gene va, and for the several commissioners on the part of the United States called for by ! the treaty. His Majesty, the King of Italy, the President of the Swiss Confederation, and fits Majesty, the Kmpcror of brazil, have each consented, on the joint request of the two powers, to name an arbitrator for the tribunal at Geneva. 1 have caused my thank® to he suitably expressed for the readiness with which the joint request has b.-cn complied with b. the appointment of gentlemen of eminence and learning to those important positions. His Majesty, the Kmpcror of Germany, has been pleased to comply with the joint re quest of the two governments, and has con sented to act as the arbitrator of the dis puted Costar boundary lie tween the Unite ! States and Great Britain. The controlling parties in the tr. aty have undertaken to regard as settled between themselves, certain principles of public law for which the United States ha\ contend ed from the commencement of their history. They have also agreed to bring these princi ples to the knowledge of other maritime powers and to invite them to accede to them. Negotiations are going on as to the form of the note by which the invitation is to bo extended to the powers. 1 recommend the legislation necessary on the part of the United States to bring into operation the articles in the treaty relating to the fisheries, and to the matters touch- : iug the relations of the United States to- ( ward the British American possessions, to become operative as soon as the proper leg islation snail be had on the part of Great Britain and its possessions. ltsi® much to bo desired that thi: legislation may become co-operative before the fishermen of the I nited States begin to make their arrange ments for the coining season. I have addressed a communication, of which a copy is herewith transmitted, to the Governors of New York. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wis consin, urging upon the Governors of those states, respectively, the necessity of activi ty on their part to carry into effect the object of the article of the treaty, which contemplates the use of the canals on either ! side, connected with the navagation of the lakes and rivers, forming the boundary, in terms of equity, by the inhabitants r.f’botb countries: and it is hoped that the impor tance of the object, and the benefits to flow therefrom, will secure the speedy approval of the legislature of the states concerned. THE 

NORTHWESTERN HOI MIARV. T renew the recommendation for an ap propriation for determining the true posi tion of the 4Sth parallel of latitude, where it forms the boundary between the United States and the British North American possessions, between the bake of tin Woods and the summit of the lloekv Mountains. The early action of Congre-- on the recommendation named, won! 1 put it In the power of the War Department ! ■ place a force in the field during the next : mi miner. PROTECTION OR GERMAN® j\ PARIS. The resumption of diplomatic relations , between France and Germany have enabled me to give directions for the withdrawal of the protection afforded to Germans In France by the diplomatic and consular rep- . resontatiyos of the United States, in that country. It is just to add that the delicate ( duty of this protection ha® been performed by the Minister and consulate in Paris, and the various consuls in Franco, under the supervision of the latter, with great kind ness as well as with prudence and fact. I heir course has received the commenda tion of the German government, and has wounded no susceptibility of the French. The government of the V.mperor of Ger many continues to manifest a frien feeling toward the .United States, and a j desire to harmonize*with the in Aerate and ■ just policy which this government main tains in its relations with the Asiatic powers, as well as with the South Amer ican Republic. 1 have given assurance that the friendly* feelings of that govern ment itre fmly shared by the I nited States. RELATIONS witu ATSTRIA. The ratification of the consular aiul nat nralixafinn connection with the Austro- Hungarian Umpire has b<'tn changed. ITALI V>: r.MTV. I liAvo boon oftciillv mi formed of the an nexation of the Stnt 's of the Church to the Kingdom of Italy, and the removal of the i capital of that kingdom to Rome, in con- 1 formation with the established poliev of the I idled States 1 have recognized this change. TREATY OF COMMERCE WITH ITALY. The ratifications of the new treaty of commerce between the Tinted Statesand Italy have been exchanged. The two powers have agreed in their treaty that , property at sea shall be exempt from cup tnre in case oi war between the two power*. Ihe I nited States have spared no oppor tunity of incorporating this rule into the obligations of nations. AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST SPAIN. The Forty-first Congress, at its seeomi session, made an appropriation for the or ganization of a mixed commission for ad judicating upon the claims of citizens of the Rutted States against *j.ain, growing out of the insurrection iu Cuba. That commission ha since been organized. I transmit a copy of the correspondence, r lating to it- formation and its jurisdiction. It is to 1 • Loped that this commission will afford the claimants a complete remedy for their injuries. It ' a- been made the agreeable duty of the United States to preside over a con ference at Washington between the pleni potentiary of Spain am. the allied South American republics, which has resulted in uu armistice, with the reasonable assurance of a permanent p. ace. 

RELATIONS W ITH HI SSIA. The ultimate friendly relations which have so long existed betwe *n the L nited "Taies and Ru-.-ia continue!, undisturbed. The visit of the third son of the Emperor is a proof that there is no desire on the part of bis government to diminish the cordiality of those relations. The hospita ble reception which has been given to the Grand ]>uke is a proof that on our side we share the wishes of that government. The inexcu-.able course of the Russian Minister at Washington rc•llde>~'' , it neces sary to ask bis retail, and :o decline longer to receive that functionary as a dip lomatic representative. It was impossible, w ith a ju.-t regard for the dignity of the coun try to permit Mr.Cataca/.vto continue to hold interviews with tbi- government after hi* abuse of government officers, an ! during bis per-ii tent interference, through various means, with the relations between the I'nit. i States an I oth it p ■•.ers. In ac cordance with my wishes, our government has h-en relieve 1 of further intercourse with M. Catacazy and the management of the affairs of the imperial legation has passed into the hands of a gentleman en tirely unobjectionable. RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. With Japan we continue to maintain intimate relations. Ibe cabinet of the Mi kado has since the close of the last session of Congress, selected citizen© of the United Mates to serve in office* of important de partments of the government. 1 have reason to think that this selection i- due to an appreciation uf the disinterest edness of the policy which the United States have pursued towards Japan. It is our desire to continue to maintain this disinter ested and just policy with China as well as Japan. THE COREAN TROUBLES. The correspondence transmitted here with shows that there is no disposition on the part of this government to swerve from its established course, prompted by a de ,-ire to put an en 1 to the barbarous treat ment of our shipwrecked sailors on the Corean coast. 1 instructed our Minister at Pekin to en deavor to conclude a convention w ith Corea, for securing the safety and humane treat ment of -m b mariners. Admiral llodgors was instructed to accompany him with a sufficient force to protect him in case of need. A small surveying party, sent out on reaching the coast, was treacherously attacked at a disadvantage. Ample op portunity was given for explanation and apology for the insult, and neither came. A force was then landed, and after an ar duous march over a rugged and difficult country, the fort® from w hich the outrage had been committed, were gallantly* as saulted and were destroyed. Having thus punished the criminals and vindicated the honor of the flag, the expedition returned, finding it impracticable under the circum stances to constitute the desired conven tion. I respectfully offer the correspond ence relating thereto therewith submitted, and leave the euhjert for such action as Uongress may see fit to take. . RELATIONS WITH MEXICO AND SOUTH AMERICA. The Hi public of .Mexico has not yet re pealed tlie very objectionable law -estab lishing what i® know n a® the Frozen Zone, the frontier of the I nited States. It is hoped that this may* yet he done, also that more stringent measures may be token by that rej iblic for re lining lawless j■ i sons on the frontier. 1 hope that Mexico, by* it® own action, will soon relieve the government of the difficulties experienced from tin ,-e causes. Our relations with the various republic® of Central and South America continue, with one exception to be* cordial and friendly*. I recommend ac tion by Congress r girding to the overdue installm ts under the award of the Vene zula claim commission of 1 Mid. The internal dissensions of this govern ment present no justification for the ab sence of effort to meet their solemn treaty obligations, I lie ratification of an extra dition treaty with Nicaragua has been ex changed. EM A N CIP AT tON IN 

BRAZIL. It is a subject for congratulation that the great Umpire of Brazil has taken the initiatory steps toward the abolition of slavery. Our relations with that empire, always cordial, v ill naturally be more so by tin® act. It i not too much to hope that the government of Brazil may hereaf ter find it for its interest, as well as intrin sically right, to advance toward entire em ancipation more rapidly than the present act contemplates. Its true prosperity and greatness a® a nation tire to be found in the elevation ami education of its laborers. 

H.AVERY IN SPANISH (oI.OME®. It is a . * fi n : ;:..-.t ; h refi rii in sh; direction, which were voluntarily promised by the state men of Spain, have not been carried out in it® Best Indian colonic®. The law s an I regulation.® foi the apparent abolition ot slavery in Cuba and i'orto Rico have left the laborers in bondage with no hope of release until their lives become a burden to their employers. AMERICANS OWNING SLAVES. 1 de-ire t i direct your attention to the* fact that the *itTens of the United States arc largt holders, in foreign lands, of this spe cie-of property, forbidden by the funda mental law of their alleged country. 1 recommend to Congress to provide, bv stringent legislation, a suitable n medv against the bolding, owning <u* dealing in slaves, or being interested in slave proper ty on foreign lauds, either us owners, hirers, or mortgagers of the Unite I State®. CUBA. It is to he regretted that the disturbance in the island of Cuba continues to be a source of annoyance and of anxiety. The i xistencc of a protracted struggle in such dose proximity to mir ow n country, without apparent prospect of on early ter minati in, cannot bo other than an object ■ rn to a people who, w bile abstain ing from interference in the affairs of other powers, naturally desire to sec every coun try in the undisturbed enjoyment of liberty and the blessings ot free institutions. Our naval commanders in Cuban waters have been instruct ' I. in case it should be- Coine necessary, to spare no effort to pro tect the live® and | roperty of bona tide American citizens and to maintain the dignity of the flag. It is hoped that all pen ung qne-tions with Spain, growing oat vit the affairs in Cuba, may be adjust ed in the spirit of peace and concord w hich has hitherto gukh I th< two powers in their treatment of sncli questions. DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND 1 I Javan. To give importance and to add to the ef ficiency of our diplomatic relations with i dapau and China, and to further in retain | iug the good op.aion of those people and 1 to secure to the Tinted States its share of the commerce destined to flow between th< >c nations an t die balance of the coiu m rcial world, 1 oaniesliy recommend that an appr>j riati,m made to support, at bast, t it American youths iu each of these countri* s to severe in the official family of ( ur minister there. . Our representative w ould men Sc placed oa an equality with the representatives of Treat Britain, and several other powers. A> m>w situated, our representatives in China and Japan have to depend for inter preters and translator*, upon the natives of these countries, win* know oar language imperfectly, or procur* for the occasion the services of employes off ire : gn business i 1 i*e*. or the interpreters to other foreign ministers FACinc steamsnir lines. I would also rceimini nd 151 •• n*l mea sures for the purpose of parting the Amer ican line uf steamers now plying between .San Franciace and Japan and China, and the Australian iine, at most our only re maining linos of ocean steamers, and of in creasing their service. the Tariff ox taxes. I recommend that all taxes from internal sourc'-e be abolished, except those on spir ituous, vinous and malt liquors, and tobac co in its various forms, from stamps. In readjusting the tariff. I suggest that a careful e.-timate be made of the amount of surplus revenue collected, under the pres ent laws, after providing for the current expenses of the government, the internal account, and a sinking fund; and, that this surplus be reduced hi such manner as to afford ilw greatest revenue. There are many articles not produced at home such as medicines and compounded essences, from which but little revenue is derived, but which enter into general use. Such articles I recommend to be placed on the free lists. Should further reduction prove advisable, 1 would then recommend that it be made up on articles which can bear it without disturbing home proiuc- j tions, or reducing the wages of American labor. I have not entered into figures, because to do so w mid be to repeat all that is laid before you in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury. The present laws for collecting revenues pay collectors too 'mail salaries, but provi le for shares in all seizures, which, at principal ports of entry particularly raisQthe compensation of these officials to a large sum. It has always seemed to me as if this system in ist at times work perniciously. it holds out an inducement to dishonest men, should such got possession of these offices, to be las in their scrutiny of goods entered, to enable them finally to make large seizures. Your attention is respect fully invited to this subject. THE 

NATIONAL DEBT. The national debt has been reduced to the extent of *80,057, lthl.Bo during the year, and by the negotiation of national bonds at a lower rate of interest, the inter est uf the public debt has been so far dimin ished, that now the sum to be raised for interest account is nearly $17.'100,000 less than on the Ist of March, Itsoo. It was highly desirable that this rapid diminution should take place, both to strengthen the credit of the country and convince its citizens of their < ntire ability to meet every dollar of liability without bankruptcy; but in view of the accomplish ment of these desirable ends, of the rapid development of the resources of the country, 1 and it- increasing ability to nv-et the large , demands, and the amount already paid, it ; is not desirable that the present resources : of the country should continue to be taxed i in order to continue this rapid payment, j I therefore reeomend the modification of both tariff and tax laws. COM) AN'S) 

CURRENCY. Continued fluctuation in the value of gold, compared with the national currency, has a most damaging effect upon the increase and uevelnpement of the country, in koep i ing up prices of all the articles necessary i in every day life; it foster- a spirit of j gambling prejudicial alike to national mor als and to national finances. If the ques -1 tinn can be met as to how to get a fixed 1 value to our currency, that value constantly j and uniformly approaching par with specie, a very desirable object will be gained. ■ THE ARMY. For the operations of the army in the ! past year, the expense of maintaining, csti mates for the ensuing year,and for continu- I ing sea coast and other improvt moots con j ducted under supervision of the War De [ partment I refer you to the accompanying ' report of the Secretary of War. 1 call your attention to the provisions of j the act of Congress, approved March 2d, 1 SO*J, w hich discontinm s promotions in j staff corps of the army until provided for :by law. I recommend that the number of I officers in each grade of staff corps be fixed, | and that whenever the number in anv one grade falls below the number so fixed, that ! the vaeancy may be tilled by piomotion from the grade below*. 1 also recommend that when the office of chief of corps becomes vacant, the place may be tilled by a selection from the corps in which the vacancy exists. The report of the Secretary of the Navy show - im provement in the navy, and efficiency of tlie naval force, without material increase in expense of supporting it. This is due to the policy which has been adopted and i® being extended as fa -1 as our material w ill admit of using smaller vessels as cruis ers on the several stations. By these means wo have been enabled to occupy at once a larger extent of cruising ground, to visit more frequently* tbe posts where the presence of our flag is desirable and generally to discharge more efficiently the appropriate duties of the navy in time of peace without exceeding the number of men or the expenditures authorized bv law*. During the past year the navy has, in addition to its regular service, supplie t the men and officers and the vessels of the coast survey, and has completed the sur veys authorized by Conge of the I-th ! mils of Darien and Tehauntepce; and un l'>r like authority has sent out an expedi tion completely furnished and equipped to expl ire the unknown <k an of the North. I The suggi stiuns < t the report as to the ! imce'sity for increasing and improving the 1 material of the navy, and the plan recom mended for reducing the personnel of the service to a peace standing by the gradual abolition of certain grades of offices and reduction of others, and the employ ment of ■ some in the service of the commercial ma rine, are well considered, and deserve the attention of Congress. 1 also recommend that all promotions in j the navy above the rank of captain he bv i selection instead of bv sonority. This 'course will secure in the higher grades greater efficiency and hold out an incentive to your officers to improv* themselves in the know ledge of their profession. Ihe present cost <d' maintaining the navy, and its cost compared with tiiat of preceding years, and estimates fur the en -1 suing year, are contained in the accompa | uyiug report of the Seer tary of the Ntivv. THE 

I’OST OFFICE. The enlarged receipts of the Post Offi c e Department, as shown by the accompany- ; ing report of the Postmaster General, ex hibits a gratifying increase in that branch of the public service. It is the index of the growth of education and of the pros perity of the people, two elements highly conducive to the vigor and stability of re publics, with a vast territory like ours, j much of it sparsely populated' but all re quiring the services of the mail. It is n.it at present to be expected that this depart ment can be made self-sustaining, but a gradual approach to this end from vear to year i® confidently relied on, and the dav is not far distant when the Post Office De- i partment of the Government will prove a much greater blessing to the whole people than it is now. The suggestions of the Postmaster Gcn ' era! for improvements in the department presided over by him are earnestly recom mended to your especial attention, especial ly the document favorable to the considera tion of a plan for uniting the telegraph system of the Tnited States with the pos tal system. 1 It is believed that by such a course the cost of telegraphing could be much reduced, and the service as well, if not better, ren dered. It would secure the further a Ivan tage by extending the telegraph through portions of the country w here private en terprise will not construct it. Commerce, trade, and. above all, the ef forts to bring a people, widely separated, into a community of inter .-ts.'are alwavs benefitted by a rapid communication: and education, the grand ground-work of Re publican institutions, is encouraged bv in creasing these facilities together with Speedy news from all parts of tbe coon try. The desire to reap the benefit of such improvements will stimulate education, i refer you to the report of the Postmaster General for full details of the derations , of last year, and for comparative state ments of results of former years THE PfliLlC 

LANDS. I renew my recommendations that the pubiic lands be regarded as heritage to oar children, to be disposed of as required for occupation and to actual settlers. Those already granted have been, in groat part, disposed of in such a way as to secure ac cess to the balance bv the hardy settler who may w ish to avail himself of them: but caution should be exercised even in ai ming so de-ireablo an object. Educational interests may well be serve! by the grant of the proceeds of the sale of public lands to settlers. EDUCATION A L. I do not wish to be understood as recom/ mending in the least degree a curtailment i of what is being done by the general gov ernment for the encouragement of v loca tion. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, submitted with this, will give you information, collected and prepared fur publication, in regard to the census taken during the year 1 f*7‘*, the operations of the Bureau of Education for the year, the Patent Office, the Pension Office, the Land Office and Indian Bureau. ACRICI LTI RE. The report of the Commissioner of Ag riculture gives the operations of his depart ment for the year. As agriculture is the groundwork of our prosperity - , too much importance cannot be attached towards labor; and his department is in the hands of an able bead, yvitb able assistants, all jealously devoted to introducing into the agricultural productions <>f the nation all the useful products adapted to the various climates and soils of our vast territory, and to the giving of ail useful information as to the best method for the cultivation of plants. Quietly but surely the Agricultural Bureau is working a groat national good, and if liberally supported the more widely its influence will he extended, and the less dependant wc shall be upon the products , of foreign countries. SALARIES. The subject of compensation to the heads of bureaus and officials, hoi ling positions of rosj ousibility ami requiring ability and character to fill properly, and one to which your attention is invited. But few - of the officials receive a compensation equal to the respectable support of a family, while their duties are such a- to involve millions of interest. In private life their services demand compensation equal to services rendered. A wise economy would dictate the-same rule in the government service. GOVERNMENT EXPENSES. I have not given the estimates for tlie support of the government f>>r the ensuing year, nor the comparative statemeitt be tween the expenditures fur the year just passed and the year just proceeding, be cause all these figures are contained in the accompanying reports, or in those present ed directly to Congress. Those estimates have my approval.
