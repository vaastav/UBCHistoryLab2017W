During the proceedings Parnell announced that the Sergeant-at-Arnis of tire House of Commons had granted the Irish members the use of the committee-room until 7 o'clock. Healy disputed that official's right to de termine the length of the deliberations, aud requested that he be notified to that effect. l'arnell declined the proposed message as impertinent. Objection was raised to telegrams from in dividuals being received during the proceed ings. During the discussion a telegram personal to P.-.rneil was read.

Sexton, who re;re"ents the Western Divis ion of Belfast, said if the opinion of the Bel fust Nationalists was coutrjry to his, he would resign.

DECEMBER 4. 1890-EIGHT PAGES. EARNEST PROTEST. Strong Opposition to the Pass age of the Lodge Bill A Resolution Unanimously Adopted by the national Farmers' Alliance. Senators Petitioned to Employ All Fair and Legal Meaus to Prevent tbe Enact ment ot the Measure. >* Brcc!-.! to The Morxino Cail. Oscala (Fla), Dec. 3. —The sensation of the morning session of the Farmers' Alliance, was when President Livingstone of the Georgia Alliance arose to a question of privilege, ar.d denounced as infamously false the insinuations in certain newspapers aimed at Dr. MeCuue and himself, aud even al President Polk, in connection with the recent Senatorial contest iv Georgia. Ho demanded the appointment of a fair mid Im partial committee to thoroughly investigate the charges. President Polk and Dr. Mc- Cune also spoke, and it was decided that a committee of investigation be appointed, to consist of one member from each State dele gation, to make a thorough and searching Investigation in accordance with the demand of the geutlemen censured. At the afternoon session McAllister of Mississippi introduced a preamble and reso lution setting forth that the President of the United States, iv his annual message, recommends and urges tlio immediate passige of the Lodge bill; that said bill involve? a radical revolution Iti tho election machinery of the Union, and its passage will be fatal to the autonomy of the S-ate and the cherished liberties of the citizens ; that the said bill is partisan iv its appli a tion, thus revolution zing the hoary ghost of sectional estrangement; that the alliance has declared against sectionalism.

McAllister made a strong speech in favor of the resolution. Delegate Deming of Pennsylvania said he regarded the introduction of the resolu tion as untimely; that there was largely prevalent at ihe North a feeling thnt the Farmers' Alliauce was a Southern organiza tion, and that the passage of these resolu tions would strengthen tiieir opinion and check the growth of the alliance in tne North and East. A delegate from Illinois expressed the sentiment that he feared the adoption of the resolution would confirm the charge that the Fanners' Alliance is a partisan body. "The alliance," he said, "is getting a grip iv the Uest and in localities where tbe Republican sentiment is strong. This action uf tiie national order w, uld tend to throw it into political disrepute and stop its expansion over the States In the West and Northwest." AfP-r several other speeches, however, McAllister's im, tinu to adopt the resolutions was put ani carried unanimously, amid wild enthusiasm. A resolution was also adopted denouncing the Louisiana lottery as a biow at American Civilization and morals, and asking for the submission to tho penple of America an amendment to the American Constitution prohibiting the operation of lot'.eiies in any State. A resolution wiil be offered to-morrow in dorsing Senator Stanford's bill for loaning money ou laud. THE HOP TItADE. Probabilities cf nn Unusual Demand for Ex port to Europ-an Countries.

He referred to the statement of General Miles, in a published interview, that the Indians were driveti to revolt by starvation, and snid It was a crime oi the part of the Government to stand by aad do nothing except furnish arms to the whites. The Indians had been suffering for years iv silence. There wasguiltinesssome where in connection with it. The hostilities iuto which the Indians of the Northwest were being starved would result not merely iv the destruction of many Indians, but the lives of thousands of American citizens and hsndrrds of Americau soldiers. That con dition of things had been brought about by rt-ggardliness or a parsimonious or dishonest policy, he knew hot which. A polic v had been pursued to take the lands of the lu dieus and not pay enough for them to keep the Indians from starving wheu dispossessed of their homes. Hawley spoke briefly, saying he had no objection to the remarks of the Senator from Indiana, except that they were, per haps", a liitle exaggerated. i'awvs. Chairman of the Commitlee on In di.u Affairs, very much doubted if a short nejs of food was the origin of the troub!-, or tliat the simply of food would be a cure for it. The difficulty with the Indian sserv e ail al. us had been a constant chaur-e of policy. Heretofore lor years it liad been impressed uion Congress that the be-t way to treat tlit- Indian wa-, lo starve him into self-sup port. "Boot, hog, or die," had been the phi-use put over the door of those who ad- Muistercd the affairs of the Indians, and t . policy had been to cut down year by year the rations required by treaties and give notice to the Indians that next year they were only to have so much, the differ ence to bo supplied hy the labor of their own hands. He thought it well to hold out every inducement to the Indians to turn from their dependence on Guvernmcnt ra tions aud supply their own support, and that it was well to resort to all devices wiihiii the limits of justice and reason to induce lhem to do it. As to the suggestion iv the public press that the Gov ernment had failed tv keep its promises made to the Indians by tho Sioux Commis sion, etc., he -raid the commission had made two sorts of stipulatiou with the Indians, One of them was writtcu out in plain lan guage aud enacted Into a law by Cougiess aud that stipulation the commission hud taken out to the Indians and asked them to accept it. The Indians had hail causo of complaint because of the non-fulfillment of other agreements and the commission told them it hud no authority as to those mat ters, but lhat it would use its Influence with the Government In the case. When the Indian representatives came to Wash ington with the commission a full discussion was had and an agreement embodied in a bill, which was submitted to Congress by tho President. The bill thus framed to thn complete satisfaction of tbr) Indians passed the Senate. But where It was now he did not know. lie kne.v, however, that the skutsof the Executive and of the Senate were clear of any attempt to depart one iota from tiie assurances given to tuo Indians by the commission. He (D.iwes) saw the Indian troubles, with a full apprehension of the danger mid of the necessity of some present relief to bring around a composure amoug the Indians aud extricate them from the lead of such bad Indians as Sitting Bull and Bed Cloud, who were the bane and curse of their tribes. Vooiliees repelled the "feeble attempt at a sneer" on the part of Dawes, and sai.' the latter knew the situatiun just as well as he did, lor Ceneral Miles had told the public Unit the Indians had been made hostile, and preferred to die fighting than die of starva tion. These red men Could enter the held with 

GOOO lighting men. well armed, aud with the advantage of a knowledge ot tho country. They could fir-lit (iOOO of the best American troops ou terms ot equality, lie asked the ."Senator from Massachusetts tv state whether these Indians had enough to cat; whether Miles was right or wrong, aud whether the Indians were being starved into belligerency. Dawes said tiiere was great difficulty in dealing with those 0000 Inuiuus who are*re bellious, aud that they have nothing to eat. They are away from their tepees, and they beloug to that class of Indians who never did a day's work in their lives. Pierce of North Dakota said he hai some times wondered that the white pe/ple in that region did not themselves go on {lie war path because they were hungry, lie (pierce) lived witnin a few miles of the great Sioux Reservation. He had beeu there for the last two months and this was the first time ho had heard it asserted that the Indians were on tiie warpath because they were hungry. He saw Indians every day in the town where he lived and they were sleeker and uetter fed, apparently, than the Senator irom Indiana. [Laughter]. He had no doubt but lhat in some of the. agencies tliere arc Indians who complain of insufficient food, but he questioned very much whether Geuerai Miles made the statement attributed to him in the news papers. The trouble with the Indians is they are fed and clothed and allowed to live ou the bounty of the Government, and the "devil finds mischief still for idle hands to do." Voorhees said he would take the statement of General Miles far Sooner than that' of the Senator who lived near the reserv 'tion, and who, Willi bis people, wauted to get the Indian lauds as soon as possible. Oue was a reliable officer; the other was the fox, lying around the pen where the geese were waiting tv get some of them. The discussion had not closed when, at 3 o'clock, tho Vice-President laid beforo the Senate ns ui*fi uished business the Elec tions Bill. Turpie took the floor iv opposition. The substitute moasurc, be said, rested for its support ou what Was called the suppressed colored Republican vote in the Soutb. In the course of his remarks he said that in the Northern States.where all tliis outcry is made, the colored men had uo more chance of pre ferment thau a Roman Catholic bad in New Hampshire a hundred years ago. The sup pression of the colored rote in tiie South was the thing manifestly in question— affirmed on one side aud denied on the other— but the suppression of the colored vote iv the North was a thing without question, actual, abso lute, unconditional. The supremacy of the white race was not peculiar lo any portion of the United States. South Carolina was not more completely under its swny thau Pennsylvania. The uian (especially the man of the White House) who sought to embroil the white and black races for a purpose he could not conceal and dare not avow, was guilty of an outrage tenfold greater than any of those he invest d or described. Wherever the people of the different races were living peacefully together under the same laws, members of the same body poli tic, without any other thought than that some must command aud others obey, the race problem was bring solved. The pur pose of the National Elections Bill was, so far as it related to the South, to wreck and destroy this pending condition of inter racial adjustment. It proposed not to main tain the will of tbe majority, but to. over throw it on the single is-ue of race ; to make a majority of the black men because they are black; to establish a governmeut of complexion, not of opinion. The purpose of the bill was that the law of the laud must be suborned to set enmity between the white man and the black man. Pass this bill, and the right of the people to choose their repre sentative!, that right so precious and so priceless to every lover of liberty, was lost beyond recovery. At the conclusion of nis speech Turpie re ceived the congratulations of his Democratic colleagues and the Senate adjourned. THE HOUSE Passage of the Copyright Bill After an All Day's Debate. Wasiunotox, Dec. 3.— The Speaker stated the pending business was the lurther consideration of the Copyright Biil. * After arguments against the bill by Springer, l'cters aud Kerr, and iv its favor by Breckinridge of Kentucky. Farquhar, 11c- Adoo, Cummings and Butterworth, Peters moved to recommit it with Instructions to the committee to report it back witli an amendment limiting tuo life of a copyright to fourteen years. Breckinridge of Arkansas moved to amend the instructions by instructing the com mittee to provide for the importation of books of foreign authors at the rale now provided by law. Both amendments were lost. The question theu recurred on the passage of the lull, aud the roll-call resulted, ayes 130, utes 95. The House then adjourned. SANTA CltlZ HAKBOR. The Engineers Report Adversely to Its Im- provement. Wasiiixotox, Dec. 3.— Santa Cruz harbor will not be improved if the Secretary of War's recommendations count for anything. Assistant Secretary of War Grant to-day sent to Congress a report of Lieutenant- Colonel W. 11. H. Benyuard, who was ap pointed to make the preliminary examina tion of the harbor, in ciumliance with a provision of the River and Harbor Bill. He reports that in view of the co-t ot the pro posed improvements, and the small benefits to be derived by commerce, he does not con sider Santa Cruz harbor worthy of improve ment. Brigadier -General John Lincoln Casey, Chief of Engineers, agrees with him in that opinion. Benynard's report describes the position of tho harbor and says it is sheltered from winds from the northward, but open to winds an 1 seas from the south ward, the most dangerous quarter from which storms e,<me. They are more fre quent during the winter than at any other season, though several seasons have elapsed Without any violent storms at all. Benyanrd says: Santa Cruz has a popu lation of GOOD in. the towu and adjacent country. Various pioduets of £-000,000 value, yearly, are shipped to Sau Francisco and other pomls up and down the coast. It is admitted that tliose products are shipped mostly by rail between Santa Cruz and San Francisco, and that the going by ships is Comparatively small. During the year 1880 12,391 tons of freight were shipped by steamer, aud only 3219 tons of freight of all kinds received. As it is stated that the products of Santa Cruz ana vicinity per year amount to djo.OsT tons, it will be seen how small a proportion is carried by vessels. It is stated that the harbor improvements would greatly increase the shipping busi ness. It may be observed, however, that storms nre infrejiueut, and there are mauy occasions during the year when ships can leave the harbor of Sauta Cruz without danger, but no advantage seems to be taken of three opportunities. The records of the Custom-house for 1880 show the local count ing tiade to be limited, and there Is no evi dence to warrant that there will fie any con siderable increase in the near future. A Democratic Caucus. Washington-, Dec. 3.— The Democratic Senators, at a caucus this afterooon, decided to maintain their opposition to the Elections Bill, seize every opporlunitv to discuss it exhaustively and strive to amend every ob jectionable feature as it is reached iv tho detailed consideration of the measure. The caucus did not undertake to formulate an order of business as the Republican Senators bave not yet completed their programme. A New Silver Bill. Wasiiixotox. Dec. 3.— Taylor of Illinois Introduced in tho House to-day a joint reso lution requiring the Secretary of the Treas ury to purchase at Ihe market price, not to exceed $1 for 37L23 grains of pure silver, the 13,000,000 ounces of silver vow in the United States, and hereafter to confine the monthly purchases to the domestic products. RAILROAD COMBINATION, A New Association to Embrace All Western and Pacific Coast Roads. New Yokk, Dec. 3.— The World says: It is proposed in Wall street to form a new railroad combination to succeed the present seveial associations now existing west of Chicago and St. Louis. The new associa tion is to embrace all the roads west of St. Louis and Chicago to the Pacific Coast, and it is to continiie not less than five years. One of ■ the prominent leaders iv the con templated association, thus outlines its scope: The association is to have a general manager or commissioner with such assist tants as may he agreed upon or found neces sary. It will regulate through tariffs, the management of competitive business aud the conduct of outside agencies for the procuring of traflic, as well as routing it over the respeclive roads in such amount, man ner nnd proportion as may ire agreed upon between the members. During the existence oi ihe agreement tho members of the asso ciation must not construct any new railway lines ilntt might compete in a local territory with the business of another member of the association, at least without the consent of the pai tics to be affected. A Board of Ar bitration will be nannd, to which nil ques tions shall be finally referred for arbitration where tne parties cauuot agree between themselves. objections to the 

SCHEME. The Commercial Advertiser has obtained an interview with C. I*. Huntington, who says he is not favorable to the scheme lor nu allianc eof all the roads west of Chicago. Be thinks it is only a half-way measure. It is better than nothing; but he says be has suggestions to niako at the proper time. He ooes not object to any one thing, but to the scheme as a wholo. No paper has been signed, except one calling the meeting. He knows of no obstacle to an agreement. As President of the Southern Pacific, he has is sued a call for a meeting of the railroad of ficials and Hankers identified with railroad interests. He slates no agreement has been signed, and no provision for information in regard to the purpose of the uieeting is con tained in the naper. It is simply a call for a meeting— nothing more. No meeting or con ference has yet been held, and uo result reached in regard to the formation of a uew association, although the street is flooded with schemes and agreements which it is as serted have been consummated. 

I'EFUSED TO ANSWEIt QUESTIONS. Chicauo, Dec. 3.— James C. Peasley, Treasurer of tho Burlington Railroad, was brought iuto the Federal Court this after noon lor refusing to answer questions be fore the Federal Grand Jury aud refusing to produce the books and papers of the com pany. The jury is trying to discover whether the road is violating the Interstate Commerce law by giving certain shippers re bates. Judge Blodgett decided that Peasley must answer and produce the books. Indications of a Long Strike, Birmingham (Ala.), Dec. a— The striking coal-miners have been joined by nearly all the meu at work Monday. All the mines are idle exceit where convicts are worked or negroes have been secured. Eight thou sand miners aie now idle. The indications are tliat the strugglo will be long and bitter. Nearly half the lurnaces in the district blow out their blnsts this week. Others will soon follow as the stock of coke is exhausted.

Plans of the Democrats to Op pose Its Passage. Silver Men in the Hcuse Will Demand a Free Coinage Measure. Ex-Governor Pacaeco Likely to Succeed Miz ner as Minister to Central America. Postofflce Site. Special to The Mornixo Call Washington, Dec. 3.— The fight in the Senate over the Federal Election Dill is the principal topic of discussion in Washington . to-day. At present the situation appears thusly: A majority of the Re publican leaders are determined and enthusiastic in their policy; the minority are indifferent about the matter, but listen ing, aud a few are positively opposed to it. The Democrats have not Republican ideas, and they enter the right counting more on their efforts tlian upon auy combina tion they may possibly make. Tbeir plan is very simple. They propose to opeu the discussion of the matter as they would that of ai£- other bill of its importance, and to continue in that spirit as long as possible. They will also refrain from any action that could be pronounced dilatory as long as possible. Gorman will be accorded the leadership iv the fight, and au effort will be made to keep within the ilne of conservatism. But when the majority bring in their proposition to cut off debate and force the biM through by a departure from the established practice and rules of the Senate the minority will fight to uphold tho traditions of the Senate and will oppose the application of the previous question. THK 

DEMOCRATIC PLAN. . No matter how extreme the parliamentary tactics are that have to be employed, not until theu will there be any filibustering, but then every power that the minority possess will be exercised. The parlia mentary revolution in the Hunse was effected at tho opening of the first session by first applying the rule and then adopting it. To adopt a rule giving the Speaker the right to count a quorum the Speaker counted a quorum, but the House was acting without rules uuder the gen eral parliamentary law. WILL FIGHT TO THE LAST. The Senate has rules whicli must be in operation pending the proposed change, which must be considered under these rules, unless it is proposed to dash them aside by an actual revolution. If there is to be any disagreement ap parent in the ranks of the majority at this juncture it will be man ifested. Here is where the -Democratic Senators will dig their trenches and lie ia tbem day and night, but never yielding au inch of ground. They will re serve their r-treugth until the time when the reil lighting is forced upon tliein, trusting to its beiug enough to carry them through. Meanwhile there are many things which may annoy the ad vocates of tne measure wliu insist upon its being put forward to the exclusion of all business. THE SILVER MEN IMI*AT*.-NT. The silver meu are impatient to get the Election Bill out of the way and seem indif ferent about its passage. It may be they will demand the signing of their measure as the price of supporting the Election Bill. Then there are the Labor, Apportion ment and Appropriation bills to be con sidered, and these may fail on account of the Election Bill taking up all the time. Every effort will be made to get and ktep a quorum iv the House, so that if the bill comes back tliere with Senate amendments they will be able to complete action ou it. The Democrat-" in tho House aie prepared also. If the bill comes there again tliere will hardly be any means of obstructing its passage that will be too radical for them to attempt. WILL NOT BE IGNOIIEO. The silver men iv the House do not pro pose to be ignored at this session of Con gress if they can Help it. It is a well-knowu lact that Speaker Reed and Messrs. McKin ley aud Cannon are opposed to a lree coinage bill, and as ttiese eeutlemen constitute a majority of tho Committee on Rules tuey can prevent any su li measure coming before the House. Some of the ad vocates of tho white metal, however, affect to believe that the big trio will be compelled by the strong silver sentiment iv their parly lv yield and allow one ot the free coinage bills to be taken up and acted upou. Representative Townsend of Colorado says: "My hill will pass the House by a good rouud majority if it is ever brought up. The silver men aro already engaged in missionary work and we hope to be able to git a favorable committee report at an early date and then have a day set apart for its consideration. As I said before, it is absolutely certaiu to pass if it ever couies to a vote." LIGHT-HOUSE BOARD. In the report of the Light-house Board, whicli was issued to-day. much space is de voted to the Twelfth District, extending fiom the Mexican boundary line on tho south to the Oregon live, about 800 miles of the California coast Hue. There are iv the district thirty-live light-houses and light-beacons, forty-eight day or unlighled beacons, fourteen fog-sig nals, operated by clock-work, thirteen whistling buoys in position, three bell buoys in position, seventy-nine other buoys in position, one steamer buuy tender. Vari ous recommendations are made. The buoy age of the district is all in good condition. The bell-buoy uioortd off Slile Rock, at the entrance to San Francisco Harbor, is reported as nn excellent signal, and was qnito efficient until the heavy rains in creased the strength of the ebb tides to such a degree that it was held under water for weeks at a time. The buoy was filled with a light wire pennant which gives excellent results in the water, but in so strong a current as flows through Golden Gate under the above conditions it docs nol prevent submersion. As tliis fault seems irremediable the buoy was removed May 1, ISttO. The Mile Rucks lying as they do at the entrance of the import ant harbor ot San Francisco must always be a menace to navigation as long as they exist. They are particularly dangerous because of the eddying currents and fogs that prevail in that vicinity. The smallness of their area will nut permit a well-appointed fog signal to be established upon them. MIZSEIt'S SUCCESSOR. M. M. Estee and Representative Morrow have both been mentioned for the Central American mission, vice Mizner, recalled. Estee told your correspondent to night that tliere was no truth in the report that he was a candidate. He was here on law business, and not on a political mission. Morrow also said to the correspondent that he did not waut the position and would not accept it lt seems probable that ex-Governor Pacheco of California will bo appointed to the posi tion. Senator Stanford called on the President tliis morning, and urged Pacheco for tho position. McKeuna does not much like Harrison's action in recalling Mizner and declines to take any part in choosing his succossor. Neither does Morrow seem disposed to take a hand in the selection. lt may be that Pacheco will lose the posi tion because the California delegation Is divided on tbe matter, but It Is thought his chances are very good. Some of bis op ponents claim that he is not a bona-fide resident of California at the present time, and bas not been living in the Siate for five or six years, and that his appoint ment, if made, should not be accredited to California.
