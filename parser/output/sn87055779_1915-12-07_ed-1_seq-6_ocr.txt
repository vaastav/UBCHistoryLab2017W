While thrre i but very little in the prosidr -nt's iiips sa'f that has not hfn unticipitfd for v-ks, it is a di.tinct chullen-ff to fiiigroh.-i to rrt down to some much needed h'.:slne., and iuild an Ann rican fabric, tit for future iiN'-f ulnpss. Instrad of lim; litl a.stray on the trail :f tho "fr nzied preparedists," I'rcs't Will-on has outlin"d a program not beyond the possibility of accept". i by tho n'aonablo jmciti.-'ts. It is a former ' r.-yoar prorarn reduced to a live-year pro gram; to ) ' irrid out two years earlier than former ly antlcipac.d, and that is all. and enough. The means of doing trlM Is rIvph mu h more t onside. at ion than what Is t. be done. 4 The f5?!ab!i.shment of a merchants' marine is another Important demand of the president's riH-ssaue, seem ingly regarded by him as of at least equal Importance to preparing for Avar or "defense." as the "jiropared- Ists" are won't to call it. The merchant marine pro gram is to be I, ut a revi.-ion of the plan before con gre:?'3 at the lat session, but advanced as certain to prove adequate in time to inture us against foreign advantage ovf r our commerce. War, ac-cordinj? tit the presitlent, has taught us as never before, the need of American ships In the transportation of imports; a need that Is only less reat in limes of peace. Throughout the message the executive is rivln laryer attention to the development of our resources and material welfare, capable of benefitting the whole people, than to a .satis faction of the "preparedist" seeming thirst for yore. Which Is exactly as it should be, and. should conjfess back the president up in his plan for raising the rev or.ui for increasing and (juippimr the army and navy, you may rest quite assured that there will be less of a demand for such increase. If the burden Is made to fall upon luxuries by dinct taxation, rather than upon necessities by tariff. or. Imports, the owners of the luxuries and users of them; folk who are neer called to do battle or seldom htar such call, will soon be come very much less interested in having an enormous "preparedness" prouram put through. We regret that the president did not. or perhaps could not, for con stitutional reasons, recommend a tax on war arma ment, supplies anil munitions calculated for the warring powers. The constitutional prohibition against duties on exports probably prevents it. It would be a very pond idea however, if it could he done, since the manufacturers of war materials for Kurope. in their demands for a larger "preparedness" for the Tnited States, seem to be operating in patriotic disguise, o create a market for the continuance of such manufacturing- after the war Is over. In other words, we would favor any tax for "preparedness'' that would operate as a penalty on "Kold-plated" patriotism; or patriotism for revenue. r.ut anyhow, Prcs't Wilson has proven by his mos ?ape that he has not lost his head listening to the demands for war preparations any more than South liend. for example, lost its equilibrium yesterday in observing a ho-called "Defense I)y" by displaying the American flag. A few Hags were displayed, no doubt from patriotic motives, while others were not displayed from the same motives, the majority not caring to join in the hypocraty represented c the National 1f- fense league promoters. The American public as the president's message indicates, and as loivl observance of "Defense Day'' seems to approve, is ready for a reasonable "preparedness," but not to be accounted as vvar trust dupes. I'qually signiMcant to which is the message's refer ence to that type of "preparedness" demanded in a more Americanized Americanism. The operations of our secret. Internal foes, misusing their American right to a free press and f rt e speech, is a greater menace to us to. lay than 1- The possibility of foreign invasion. The president lias handled this in no uncertain words. An Americanism dedicated to America, not for revenue, nor under the false pin tense of preserving American liberty when as a matter of fact the purpose is to per vert that liberty and utilize it to assist some outside power: such an Americanism dedicated to America, we jay, vsith the president, is among our sorest needs. Throughout, the message is an cxpresMon of great American statt smanship. and from such trying times as thes, will go down in history as anions our sanest of slate documents. 

BLAME THVSELE, MR. PUBLIC; ROCKEFELLER'S HUMAN. Deing ju.-t common folk, void of such luxuries as a motor car, we had not particularly noticed the prices of gasoline, but the following letter, calling for an answt-r and proentcd lure instead of in the "Public I'ulsr" column, s.ivs s-unething is wrong, and based upon his statemi nt, our comment is appended. Here is the letter: I'ditor News-Times; In a little over two months, the retail price of gasoline has been ndvanc.vl nearly " .". per cent. The retailer gits r.o p.rt of this increase. The explanation of the raw i- that the h.vv price last summer was made t dr;ve 'at small dealers and, that having been accomplished.. the raising will be continued until tbe l.r:air level is reached. ome ;-e,, : m.iy think this unimportant as it the aia"'.ir:e a risto racv'" owmrs Is b.n.e . of auto :;t. e-v en so, lots of people in mod c rate cir. an.st.tru s r.ow ow n autos; trucks md ether i . : - r vehiib- have largelv sa perseilc d i. ;e h. in !,..:.. transportation .'.nd many - r.e :"rs, so that the Icar- h o'a.--eV j , llell f t!,.- pr i lit nu lease is distributed naor.g .!! Is there any vaiid re.ton for it? The way prices lir- depre-"d I -ni, at the will of a few tuen, i端 cne of U wLicf occasions of wal Uu- rest. Sor.;e day the public will either Insist on government or tringnt regulation. Ought not the publ.c have a look-in before puch increase? (an be made in the pnee of such everyday ue-e-essities a gasoline? Kl'ADI.Il. The public ought not to have anything that it does not go after. Manipulation of prices in ord'-r to strangle competition and establish a monopoly h is been the Standard Oil To.' favorite play for the past 40 years, as the public lias long known. That that ;'ine is still played Is the fault of the publi ". Just as Ls any other condition that's detrimental to the public. It is the fashion to berate the Standard methods and "cuss old Rockefeller" f,,r about every economic out rat:e that's perpetrated, but neither the Standard r.or old John is doing more than the public permit?. A democracy is all right but a democracy -which holds the power must also hold the accountably. All us.rs of gayojine are at the mercy of the Standard Oil Co.. as to th! "necessity." This is well known. There i.s no need of r. "look-In." The thing is perfef tly patent. With power to kill competition, there's nothing to prevent the Standard's raising prices :.ni) r c ut. It would likely do it. too, only it might ihus stir the public to doing something radical in its own behalf. Take all the f at hers off a goose at one "elk and you'll cause an awful squawking. Pull out the f, athi rs one at a time and you get them just the s.tine but without any disturbance or passionate re sistance. However, as our "Keid.r" indicates, as gaso line becomes more of a "necessity". Insistence upon government ownership or regulation will grow stronger. It is those who monopolii necessities who are doing the real promoting of socialism. Meanwhile, pay your gasoline bills, or walk. GETTING HID OF DIPLOMATS. It isn't necessary to hold any animosity Against Taptains IIoy-.Kd and von Papen, the naval and military attaches of the German embassy whose recall our government has asked for. Their offenses have been irritating, but it isn't likely that these gentlemen are much to blame aa individuals. They have done their duty as they saw it. Insofar as they may have ccted on their own Ini tiative, they are culpable; hut presumably their course of action ever since they began to carry the war Into America has been inspired and directed from Berlin. At any rate, they are the agents of their government, and the responsibility for their conduct rests with their government. Their dismissal is therefore a direct rebuke to the militarist-statesmen of Berlin who have not scrupled to disregard American sovereignty and ride rough-shod over American rights. There will, of course, he an outcry to the effect that our government discriminates against Teuton diplo mats. When anybody can point to a representative of any of the allied powers who has abused our hospital ity and patience as these gentlemen have done, there should be no less delay in handing him his passports. Thus far it has not been shown that any of the allied nations, or their diplomatic representatives, or their American sympathizers, have subsidized disloyalty and crime in the United states or directed a propaganda against our peace and safety, Berlin and Vienna should take this lesson to heart, in a spirit of chastisement rather than indignation. Dr. Dernberg has gone. Dr. Dumba has gone, Boy-Ed and von Papen are on their way; we don't want to have to send any more diplomats back home. BRITISH PIRACY IN DEALING WITH AMERICAN TRADE. We don't mind Britto nia ruling the wave, as long as she rules it fairly. We don't object to her pre-eminence in international trade, as long as she gains and keeps it in fair competition. But we do most seriously object when she uses her naval power to Increase her shipping and swell her trade at our expense. The ci mmandeering of the Hocking nd the Gen esee for her own use by a friendly and supposedly honest power is an insolent denial of American prop erty rights at sea. It is on a par with the German denial of our rights of life at sea, and only less serious as property Is subordinate In importance to human rights, one form of aggression is no more to be tol erated than the other. These two ships were bought from a Danish lino by the American Transatlantic company of Delaware. Thus there was no taint of belligerent origin. They passed from one neutral flag to another neutral flag. Great Britain entered a protest at the time of the transfer, charging that Germans owned an interest in the vessels. Our department of commerce rnaae a full investigation and decided that there was no ground for refusing to admit the ships to American registry. That should have settled the matter. Great Britain, however, seized them at the first opportunity, as she has seized many other American vessels, and then, without even awaiting judgment in her own prize courts, requisitioned them for her own trade. Xut h action is not only in defiance of American rights but it is contrary to British law. If the British government isn't disposed to heed the protests of the t'uited States, it will do well at least to heed the advice given in the house of lords by Viscount Bryce, the former American ambassador, and Bord Bansdowne. leader of the conservative" party, against abusing their power under the plea of "necessity." If the British government means to follow the Barl of Portsmouth, who urges it to "sweep away all judicial niceties" and all such "rubbish" as prize court law and the declaration of London, and resort to "the old 8ea laws of our ancestors." it is no better than the German admiralty in its recent, and now repudiated period of "f rightfulness." We don't expect the British to act like pirates in dealing with American shipping. If they persist, there may be a demand in this country that we act as we did in 1 1 2. and treat them like pirates. CANADA'S LOYALTY. Canada's new $00.000,000 war loan has been over subscribed to the extent of HiO.OOO.COO. Canada is Utting out a new army, raising its contribution of troops to 230. COO. Multiply all the e figures by 15, and the products will indicate what our own nation would be contributing to the war If It gave money and men in the same proposition. After this, there can't be any question of Canada's loyalty to the Dritish empire. She may quarrel with Mother Fncland now .nd then over a tariff rate or a 'iuestion of jurisdiction; but when it comes to a real test, the "Tipperary" sentiment triumphs, and "her heart's right there." ANOTHER BOSS GONE UNDER. Jim mith. deposed democratic boss of New Jersey, a: id arch political foe of Fres't Wilson, has gone into bankruptcy to the tune of $1.730.000. If you dig down leneath the surface you will find most political bofses bankrupt. Sometimes the bank ruptcy take.-- a financial turn, as in this case, but ofteaer the bosses are bankrupt morally, which is far worse for their c -editors the public. The sooner the bossing busin s;-, is broken up the betier it will be for American polit'es. The worst thin," about that For?. peace ship Is that it started a usw crop of fordcar okes.

BRYAN'S demand that some thing be done immediately to bring about mediation between the war ring nations of Burope must be an noying to the president, coming so near the 18th. but, we assume, the president will consider the source, like the man who was kicked by a Jackass. TUB ease with which the Serbian army has been swept aside and a large part of It made prisoners, raises a question as to just how much .Serbia wanted to tight.
