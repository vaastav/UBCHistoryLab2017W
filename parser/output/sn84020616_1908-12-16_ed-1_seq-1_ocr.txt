HAVE YOU Mm': V.I 1 WORD OF SEWER Mayor Lester Discusses Court, ell's Action and Says Many Do Not Understand Terms Offered. WHAT PEQPIFWANT AS WHAT HE WANTS Says Council Is Only Trying to Get Most For Money In Shortest Time and Has No Other Ob ject Than to Guard City's Interests in Matter. "I am afraid that the opposition to the present plana for giving- Al buquerque an adequate sewer system which I understand im developing In ome quarters is based upon a lack cf information as to what those plana are and the proposition now be fore the city from the American Light and Water company of Kan sas City," said Felix Lester, mayor, today. "I desire at this time to re-Iterate tny statement that I have absolutely no reason for desiring to give the contract to the Kansas City com pany, other than to safe guard the city by getting the most for the money in the shortest space of time, I am sure that this motive alone, in fluenced the council. "I have gone over the proposition made by the American Light and Water company very carefully and I can not find a single word wherein the city hazards anything, wherein It appears to me that we have every thing In our favor, with the contract ing company assuming the risk In each and every Instance. "I am afraid that . many . of the peoole have not read this pre por tion carefully and hence are not en-i tlrely clear as to what It has to of fer In the way of economy and in safeguarding the city. "In the first place I would be un alterably opposed to letting a con tract to any one company exclusive of other bidders and the council has not done so, as appears to be the popular Idea. The proposition sub mitted by the American company is not a contract to build a sewer sys tem at a stipulated price. It Is simply an agreement to build an adequate sewer system at cost with an added 10 per cent to re-imburse the company as profits on its experienced engin eers and workmen, machinery, and general risk, while limiting the amount to the city's estimate. I fee) sure that any contractor would call such a margin entirely reasonable under the circumstances. "The American company does not offer to do the work at a fixed price but simply guarantees that at the most, the coat shall not exceed the city's estimate. It simply agrees to do the work at cost and the city has every advantage in such an arrange ment because all bills will be audit ed and paid by the city, all time kept by the city's employes, all work In spected and approved by city In spectors and later by the council, and all purchases of materials etc. made 4y the city, from the lowest bidder In the open market. The contract ing company could in no manner, buy inferior supplies, make a profit on supplies or do Inferior work nor could it In any manner pad its pay roll or avoid doing the work as planned and specified by the city. In addition and I call particular atten tion to this point the American company fixes a maximum cost for the work and deposits a bond of $100,000 covering its guarantee. More than that. It leaves In the posea-din of the city, five per cent of Its ten per cent profit until the system has been accepted and fu'ly approved by the city. "The matter simply resolves Itself Into this the American company has nothing to do with fixing the cost. The city does that by the su pervision of the work. If quick sand is encountered, the contracting corn pany, no matter what its expenses, can not exceed the stipulated maxi mum figure fixed by the expert en gineer Mr. Gray. "I also call attention to the fact that the offer made by this company was not a standing offer. It was for immediate acceptance or rejection. Had there been any reason to hops for a better offer, there might have been grounds for criticism but any fair minded person will agree that considering the machinery, exper ienced employes, possible risks and heavy bond, with a maximum allow ance of time and money, the ten per cent additional over the cost. Is mall. I desire to say that I want to see an adequate sewer system as soon as possible, at the very lowest price possible to obtain, because the city is In sore need of such an Im provement, and I give It as my hon est pinion, that the proposition act sd upon by the council. Is In my es timation, about as good a one as we can expect and I think delay In the matter would have been Door buel- Vss Judgment, ''v'-v. ' Vow as the sale of the bond. The ft y "n company agrees to secure . 'v one bid or more at par. the city can sell such premium, It has the do so. I think that the bring a premium there pri. bonds by giving the city that much addi tional money or that much less debt, as you choose to put It. "If, In the opinion of the people, such a proposition Is not the very best, I shall be willing to favor what ever the majority wants but I hope that before public sentiment Is crys tal liied one way or another, that the people will thoroughly read and con sider every word of the proposition which Is made public again. In th Cltlxen today.- "Another Important feature which might not be overlooked is the sav ing which can be afforded In freight rates on all supplies. Under the pro visions of the Interstate commerce law, the railroads can give a city, re bates on such supplies. If we let the work by contract to a corporation, the railroad could not give rebates. (Blsbee, Arizona, I am informed. saved about $40,000 in this manner, In building Its waterwoiks recently and the American company did the work on a percentage basis." "Under a flexible contract, sush as the one proposed, it might also be possible to use considerable por tions of the' present sewer system, and In each instance, there would bs a saving to the city. Under an Iron clad contract, no matter how much of the present system might be used, the city would not benefit one cent.' 1LWE YOU ItKU) IT?

PULITZER MAKES REPLY TO THE ATTACK OF ROOSEVELT New York World Declares That President Cannot Muzzle That Newspaper. SAYS PRESIDENT LIBELLED NATION He Has Shown Himself the Most Reckless Demagogue Ever Trusted by American People Declares the Editor. New York, Dec. 1$. In reply to President Roosevelt's attack on Jo seph Pulitzer, the -World says ed ltorlally: t "lit. Roosevelt is mistaken. He cannot muzzle the World. "While no amount of 'billingsgate' on his part can alter our determina tion to treat him with Judicial Im partiality and scrupulous fairness, we repeat what we have already said. that the Congress of the United States should make a thorough Investigation of the whole Panama transaction that the full truth may be known by the American people. "The World arpreciates the Import Congress that 'the proprietor of the World should be prosecuted for libel by the government authorities,' and that 'the attorney general has under consideration the form under which the proceedings against Mr, Pulitzer shall be brought.' "This Is the first time a president ever asserted the doctrine of less majestle. .or proposed., In the absence of speclfio legislation, the criminal prosecution by the government of citizens, who orltlclsod the conduct of the government or the conduct of Individuals who may have had deal lngs with the government. Neither the king of England nor the German emperor would venture .to arrogate such power to themselves. President John Adams' attempt to enforce the sedition law destroyed the federalist party in America. Tet Mr. Roose velt, In the absence of law, officially proposes to use all the power of the greatest government on earth to crip pie the freedom of the press on the pretext that the government itself has been libelled and he Is the gov ernment. "It is true that the World printed the public reports concerning the Panama canal affair, which resulted In William Nelson Cromwell's appeal to the district attorney's office dur Ing the recent campaign to prevent tue publication of a story which was said to be In the hands of the Dera ocratlc national committee. It was Mr. Cromwell's own action which raised the Issue In the campaign. It Is true also that when Mr. Roose velt made his attack upon Delavan Smith, the World called attention to certain statements which Mr. Roose velt must have known to have been false or misleading, and appealed to Congress to end all scandal by a full and impartial Investigation. If this be treason, let Mr. Roosevelt make the most of it. "Mr. Roosevelt's lamentable habit of Inaccurate statements makes It Impossible to accept his Judgments or Ms conclusions. In his message ho does not state correctly, even o sim ple a matter as the pretended causes of his grievances. "The World has never said that C. P. Taft or Douglas Robinson made any profits whatever. Mr. Taft de nied that he was concerned In the transaction In any way, which denial the World published and accepted. It would have been equally glad to print Mr. Robinson's denial had It succeeded In obtaining one from him as It frequently attempted to do. The World has no evidence that he was associated with Mr. Cromwell and would accept his word to that effect- For Mr. Robinson Is a gentleman of high character, whose reputation for veracity Is Infinitely better than that or nis oistinguiBnea Drotner-in-iaw, "it the World has libelled anybody we hone It will be punished, but we don't Intend to be Intimidated by Mr rioosevru s mresu or oy mr. no.me velt's denunciation, or by Mr. Roose velt's power. "No other living man has ever so grossly libelled the United State as does this president, who besmirches Congress, bulldozes Judges, assails the Integrity of courts, slanders private rltlzens and who has shown himsel the most reckless, unscrupulous dem agogue whom the American people ever trusted with great power and au. thorlty. "We say this not In anger, but in sincere sorrw. The World has Im- measureably more respect for the of' flee Of president of the United States than-Theodore- Roosevelt has ever shown -during the, years In which "he raatutameo: a reign or terror an q imms k twmr. mnA .honesty, of 1 both public officials and private cltl- sens who opposed his policies or thwarted him In his purposes. 'So far as the World is concerned its proprietor may go to Jail If Mr. Roosevelt succeeds, as he threatens, but even in jail the World will not cease to be a fearless champion of free speech, free pre and a free peo ple. "So far as I am personally con cerned. I was at s a during the whole of October, and, In fact, practically for two years have been yachting on account of my hea'th I never read word of this Panama story, was not In connection with the paper and had nothing to dj with it. Mr. Roosevelt knows all this perfectly. He knows I am a chronic Invalid, and am mostly abroad yachting on ac count of my health. I think his an ger Is simply' due to the sharp at tacks made by the World on him po litically. For that perhaps. I am re sponsible; that is, for the general po litical criticism of Mr. Roosevelt on public and personal grounds only, t am sorry he should be so very angry, but the World will contlnae to crit icise him, without a shadow of fear, It he should succeed In compelling me to edit the paper from Jail."

LODGE REVIEWS FACTS OF BROWNSVILLE AFFAIR Senator Says Testimony Shows That Negro Soldiers bid Shoot Up the Town. WOULD RE-1SSTATE SOME TROOPERS Favors Extending Clemency to Those Who Did Not Take Part In the Riot Big Crowd Hears Speech. Washington, D. C., Deo. 16. The Brownsville affair was discussed In the Senate today by Senator Lodge, who Is a member of the committeemen military affairs which Investigated the charge that soldiers of the Twenty- fifth regiment "shot up" the town. Lodge remarked that hs would not refer to the report of the Investiga tion, referred to by the president in his recent message. The senate gallery was filled, many of the visitors being negroes. Rather more Democrats than Republicans remained in the chamber while Lodge was speaking. In opening his speech Senator Lodge referred to two questions to be discussed in this connection, one re lating to the guilt or innocence of the soldiers and the other to the bill pre sented by Senator Foraker compell ing the president to restore these sol diers to the army. "After heating and examining atl the evidence, not only that taken by the Senate committee of which I was a member, but that taken before the Penrose court-martial and before the citizens' committee," said Mr. Lodge, referring to the shooting affray In Brownsville on the night o At'.vst 18, 1906, "I have come to the clear conclusion that the shooting was done by soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infan try stationed at Fort Brown." This, he said, was also the conclu sion of the citizens' committee of Brownsville and of the Penrose court martial. It was also the opinion of decisive majority of the Senate com mittee on. military affairs. 1 "The proposition." he said, "de claring that 'the weight of the tes timony shows that none of the sol diers of ths Twenty-fifth United States Infantry participated in the shooting affray,' was rejected by a vote of 11 to 1 and the proposition that. In the opinion of the committee, the shooting was done by some sol diers belonging to the Twenty-nrth Infantry was adopted by a vote of S to 4, one senator not voting. Thus It will be seen that every official body which has heard the testimony has decided that the shooting at Browns ville on the night of the 13th of Au gust, 1906, was the work of soldiers of the Twenty-fifth infantry." Mr. Lodge declared that while there Is a great deal of evidence that the shooting was done by the soldiers. there is no evidence whatever that It was done by anybody else. There Is, he said, no physical Impossibility of time, distance or alibi to prevent our attributing the shooting to the sol diers. "In fact." he said, "It was easier for the soldiers to do It than for any body else because they were both armed and organized. Motive was not lacking. Some of the soldiers had had trouble with some of the In habitants. Justly or unjustly, some of them had been maltreated by some of the inhabitants and they had felt, In greater or lesser degree, the bit terness of race prejudice. Their free dom of movement had Just been cur tailed owing to an affair In which a white woman was Involved. They were suffering, therefore, at the mo ment, from the troubles which had arisen between them and some of the people of Brownsville." Mr. Lodge referred to testimony of witnesses to show that eleven appearing before the Senate committee, before the Blocks man and Burdy Inquiry or In the Penrose court-martial testified that the men who did the shooting were recognised by them as soldiers and negroes. Five witnesses recognized them as soldiers and six witnesses recognized them as negroes by their voices. "I submit." said Mr. Lodge, "that that Is a mass of direct evi dence sufficient to sustain any affirm ative proposition In court and not to be done away with by suggestions about the darkness of the night and Inferences that all these witnesses were lying because the artificial lights were few and there was no moon.' Mr. Lodge reviewed essential feat urea of the testimony In the Browns ville affair and said that the bullets found In the houses and the shell In the streets, taken together, could have been used In only one rifle, and that was the Springfield new model, and there were no new model Sprlngflelds In the possession of any one except the troops of the . United State. He spoke of the testimony of the soldiers as constituting "a uni form denial" 'That which renders all this testi mony, to me. of doubtful value, and deprives It of the weight which It would otherwise have," said Mr. Lodge, "Is Its extraordinary uniform ity. It Is possible for 160 or 200 men to tell without exception a story agreed upon before hand, but no two witnesses can tell the truth, aa they understand It, In precisely the same way, about the same event. The sol diers have the strongest possible mo tive for denying participation In or knowledge of the shooting. There could not have been any strong per sonal motive to Induce the witnesses on the other side to testify otherwise than truthfully." He favored the Warner bill, which allows the president to restore the In nocent to the army whenever he Is satisfied that any of them were blame less. He condemned the Foraker bill which he said attempts to force back Into the army not only Innocent men but men who were guilty of a serious crime. He made an exhaustive argu ment on the unconstitutionality of ths Foraker bill which obliges the pres ident to re-enllsf these soldiers wheth er hs thinks they ought to bo re enlisted or not. Such an act would bf an encroachment upon the consti tutional rights of the president. It would be subversive of discipline In the army, j
