HOW IT LOOH.3XN HBl'SEAT. Mr. Benjamin IIarrism and re-. putdiciii party will soon be as discour aged over their fence and fiaud bill last resort as over their tariff and liu amdal record. The farmers1 alliance has officially, fpccitically an! unanimously cctidemu- ed the force bill mtt:age aid its au thor. The country does not respond to tle presidents' message. No moro public meetings are tailed and no casual gatherings applaud the force bill po licy. Jepartraeiit reports and president's mesaccs were this year weuk beyond example. They apohgized for a ceu stis which the two tir&t American au thorities have pronounced palpably imperfect and worthless for statisti cal pu looses. They had uo more to say for the tariif. law than that ic hud been misrepresented, ami in saying bo iney introduced misrepre.-entafions of cunent business knowledge. The btd lion purchase bill was defended in the same spiritless manner. A nooitify ing foreign policy was the basis of an other apology. High prices tor wheat, corn and potatoes, caused by an ex tremely short crop, were credited to the republicans. Jdeport3 and messages had a sort of hopeless, beg-your-pardou time on every pape. No financial policy to meet the demands of agriculture and business was su,:gebtive. Jso te.sui- es for giving money value to Ameri can productions by developing mar kets and supplying internal facilities were claburaied or even indicated. The reptililican party is prostrate be fore public opinion. leaving public opinion Mr. Harrison turns to a force bill to capture votes his party cannot win from the country's free whl. Ho urges the majority he fore it dies to put into his hands mach inery for marh:ding an ignorant color ed vi-te ar.d seizing the billet boxes ia the south. ' llo and his friends wi'l grow very .i:.iCia sere before they get the force hill into operation. 0:i that issue very few states will remain in the re publican coliimn. The fanners have raised a w.arning hand. Business men are against violence and distnrl; cd relations between north and south.

It costs something to paint a bouse cr barn. -.- Some cf tite protectionists c?uitn that the manufacturers of this coun try cannot compete with foreign manu facturers, and hence demand a tariff., to shut out foreign articles; and yec these same protectionists ure in favor of subsidizing vessels to open up trade with JSouth America. If our manu facturers cannot compete athnme.how can they compete with the world in 8011th America. The following is section 33B of the McKinley law: Oi clothing ready made,and articles of wearing apparel of every description, made up or manu factured wholly or in part, not spec ially provided for in this act, felts not woven and not specially provided for iu this act, and plushes and other pile fabrics all the foregoing, composed wholly -or iu part of wool, worsted, the hair of Campbell, g'lat, aiapaca, or other animals, the duty per pound sh 11 be four and one-half times the duty imposed by this art on apaund of miwashe:! wool of the findi class, and in addition thereto sixty per centum ad valorem."

Senator Gorman, vrho proved him self such'an able and capable leader during tiie last pension of congress, was by general coii.sfiit recognized as i-ouiiuander in chief of the democratic senat'Tial army as soon as it became evident that Mr. llanison uiul -the radica republlcaa leaders has sue ceede I in whippn.g the weak-kneed republican uenaioib into voting to take up the Force bill, and this spontan eous . hoico wiis officially ratiucd by tue democratic, caucus which mtt Wednesday evei:in, ' B a curious coinc idence Mr. Blaine chai.ped to be a visitor to the diplo mauc gauery or loe bcnate, in wr.i pany w ith the Brazilian naval ofdeers who have been visiting us,- just at the time when the Force bill was. being read, and it must have required all his self " possession to prevent the con tempt he feels for that measure from showing itself iu his countenance JTr. Harrison has caused it to be semi-oliici;lly hinted that he would veto a free silver coinage bill should congress pass one, but thut fact lias not prevented a. dozen or more sena tors and repiesentatives, at least half of thcin republicans, from introducing bills providing for free coinage, and Senator Teller has stated that he has positive assurances that such a bill will pass the senate, and that he be lieves it will alao go through the llOUU. One bill has been introduced in the senate by a republican Senator Cul iom which most of the democrats would gladly vote for, if they could get a chance. It provides for one cent letter postage, which Mr. Har rison, in his anxiety to talk partisan politics, forgot to even mtnlion in his message. Quite a number of bills have been introduced in the house and senate to repeal" certain sections of the McKin ley tariff at, one of the most notable of which is that introduced by Kepre santative McCreary, of Kentucky, to put what be very aptly calls the seven blessings of mankind, tin and tin phtte, cotton ties, wgr'cultural implements and edged tools, binders twine, blan kets, worsted for men and women's Clothing and salt, upon the free list. T;e puma -on appropriation till for Uie usual year beginning July 1, lias b:-en reported to the house. It L'l i""pii ates $135,ot'0,Tti'5, and those well ii. formed say that it is less by from thirty to seventy millions of dol lars than will be required to pay the pensions during the year. Jjook out for music when this bill is discussed in the house, The h uise, after one day spent in liUibustering and one in discussion, passed the inter-national copj right bill by a Vote of 130 to 95. Persuasion, threats and bribery, cn the part of t!ie administration, by the promise of future patrot age, has so far failed to get together a quorum of republicans iu the house. Without1 that republican quorum no partisan legisJatijn will be allotted to go through the house. Dr. KoV Dicoverr The liquid employed by Dr. Koch is perhaps only a concentrated solution of a special ptomaines extracted from the culture of the turbereulous hucil lus. The action ptomaine injected un der the skin of animals is generally slower than tht which t'ollr.ws the in jection of alkaloids. Dr. Koch's liquid injected hi the same manner iu man produces a variety of symptoms ap pearing only after four or five hours. This is perhaps an indication of what it is. In titis hypothesis the ptomaine injected consecutively during severaf weeks into the. system would modify the medium of growth of the tubercu lous bacillus no as to check its develop ment. Tha cells cf the organism, finding no more obstacles, would re gain strength. Thut would explain why the ptomaine injected oIHcacious ly under the skin remains without ef fect when introduced through the di gestive organs, as seems established in regard to the substance used by lJr. Koch. This difference of action doC3 not exist iu a (similar degtee in the case of metulic substances. The future will soon teach us the truth about the nature and real value of the antidote used by the illustrious Ger man 1 rofessor,and if the hope we have cherished be not a vain one, we fchali leicfcive before long how important, from a social and economical stamU point, the care of tubercultsis is. V. o know that in the civilized woild more than a million persona die annually in middle age, their lives being cut short by this terrible L-acillus. From the re sults aUeady obtained we way hote that nil attacks of tuberculosis, pul monary or other, can be cheeked, at least in t lie beginning. Dr. Giviert Hortii American JJctwr.
