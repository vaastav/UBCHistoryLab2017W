The Democratic Executive Com mittee has not yet fixed the time for holding the contemplated caucus, It may not take place until after the holiday. Some of the more promi nent Democrats say they have noth ing to rcccommcnd other than was . stated in. the address they issued at the close of the last session of Con gress. NATIONAL MONUMENT. An effort is again being 'made to enlist public interest in the comple tion of the monument to thc'Father of his country' at the national capital. The unfinished pile is standing com mentary to the unstability of the American mind, and a silent rebuke to our patriotism. We hope the mo ment may oc linisncd before many years shall have elapsed. A GOOD THING. good story Washing ton of President Grant's dryly sar castic remark when he was shown n copy of a Western paper,which pur ported to give a list of the number of trips he had made, and miles he traveled since the war. Looking it over casually, he observed that it was pretty nearly correct, and then remarked: "I wonder if that chap kept; a full list" of my trips during the war?' 

PRINCE OF WALES. lie Prince of wales is lying at the point of death. His disease is typhoid fever. He had been dan gerously ill for some time, but was getting better and was thought at one time to be out of danger, when a relapse set in and brought him to the brink of the grave. He. has been unconscious since the first of the month with one or two days exception. Active sympathy everywhere was manifest ed. The latest dispatch on Mon day evening stated that the Prince was, restless during the afternoon uui nis exnanstion is not m- creaing. THE CUBAN QUESTION. The allusion to Cuba in the Pros ident's Message was considered tame and' unsatisfactory by Cuban partisans in this country, but it was strong enough to make a commotion in Europe. The Spanish Govern ment is alarm ed,and that paragraph in the Message is the subject of hurried, diplomatic conferences with all the leading European Govern mcnts. Additional Spanish forces are to, be dispatched at once to Cuba, and the. Spanish minister at Wash ington has been charged with im portant instructions concerning the .situation. u Suspicion haunts the guilty mind ; The thief doth fear each bush an officer." THE MESSAGE. The President's Message is every, where mentioned as a sound and sensible document, even the World is lorced to confess as much, whilst it indulges its' small soul in sundry criticisms, and attempts at weak wit at the "expense of the President's style of composition. Mr. Lincoln .quietly remarked once, with refer ence to a criticism of this kind.ven- tured if we remember righly, by Mr. Seward "Never mind that,Mr. Secretary, the people will under stand what I have written." So with the writings of Gen. Grant, they do not require a second read ing to ascertain their meaning. They are evidently all written for the peo pie not small-souled critics. HON. JAS. 

MONROE. notice that our distinguished Congressman, Hon. Jas. Monroe, lias been appointed one of the mem bers of the Committee on Banking and Currency. He will make a val uable member. We are glad to see our Democrat ic brethren acknowledge the superi ority of our distinguished Congress man, Hon. Jas. Monroe. The Farmer Bpoke ofhim as a candidate for Senator, calls'him Sherman's su " periof. Now as to the Senatorship we. would say that Sherman has been and is a very useful member in the Senate, and we have not the least objection to his re election. If .acliangc is to be made however, jilr.jMpnroc certainly would make . a-worthy'sncccssor and the Legisla ture could not' make a better selec tion. "' - ; ' r A RIDICULOUS STORY. -Tidiculous' story comes from Washington that the Democrats,un der the management of the Blnirs, are concocting ascheme for the im peachment of President Grant in conuection with the San Domingo business. The talc is too absurd fpr belief, but were true.the scheme itself would have been the height of folly. An attempt to impeach the President on such utterly untenable ground would be so malicious that disgust with the conspirators and sympathy for theirintended victim would re-elect feant rj J.uqrjrece , dented majorities, and bury 'the Democratic party beyond the reach of piumli'-lirie. of of THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President's Message meets with the most hearty approval on all hands. Even the Democratic papers acknowledge its soundness, and agree that it is a very sensible document It refers to the friendly relation of the United States with foreign countries, to the process of civilization at home and abroad,and and makes a variety of suggestions proper to the effective carrying out of the different provisions of the late treatv with Great Britain the importance of which, as the harbin ger of a more pacific mode of set tling international disputes.is terse ly, but forcibly, dwelt upon. One of the most important portions of the Message is that which in view of the rapid reduction of the pub lic debt, and the strengthening of the national credit which has fol lowed its accomplishment,questions the desirability of continuing to tax the resources of the country in the degree hitherto done, and rcc- commends a decrease in the rate of payment, and a modification of both the tarriff and internal revenue laws by abolishing all internal taxes ex cept those collected from tobacco, stamps and vinous and malt liquors, and placing on the free list "those articles which can best bear it with out disturbing home productions or reducing the wages of American labor. This idea will meet with ap proval from all class. The statements of the Message with respect to the Indians,thc Mor- mons,and the Ku-klux of the South accord with the recent policy of the Administration in regard to these matters. Contrary, however,togeri cral anticipation, it takes broad and liberal ground in favor of the re moval of the disabilities imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment, and in so doing commends itself still further to the indorsement of a very large portion of the most intelligent and thoughtful citizens of the coun try. Taken altogether, the Message will give general -satisfaction, and increase the confidence already felt that the Executive has earnestly at heart the interest and welfare of the whole people, of whatever section 

MEXICO. The news from Mexico shows that affairs there grow steadily worse. A general disaffection ex ists among the people, and the gov ernment, unable to trust its own of ficials, either civil or military, is at a loss as to what course to pursue. The Newspapers arc filled with pro nunciamcntos, to the terror of the loyalists. Meantime the revolution ists have already begun quarreling among themselves, and the two brothers Diaz, the one a General in command of the revolutionary army and the other an aspirant for the Presidency, are at cross-purposes. To add to the uncertainty of the situation, an absurd rumor has been put into circulation, to the effect that the United States government contemplates some sort of interfer ence a rumor which appears to alarm the Mexicans of all parties very much, though precisely why such a people should fear anythin; which will give them peace and or der, is not very clear. SUICIDE BY SMALL-POX. The Steubenville Herald of 4th inst, has the following: A singular case of disregard for life, by court ing a dangerous contagion, came to our notice this morning,in the death of a young man from small-pox. The deceased went from this city to Pittsburgh, and of his own ac cord applied for and obtained a sit uation at a hospital where several violent cases of small-pox were,, for the purpose he claimed afterwards of contracting the disease that he might die. He continued in the handling of small-pox patients and corpses for several weeks, and re turned home some ten days since and told his exploits among the stiffs' of the dread contagion, &ax- ing he wished he would take the small-pox, that he was tired of life and 'wanted God Almighty to take it. lie nad ins wish. In a few days after making the reckless remark, he was .stricken with the disease in the most violent form,his physicians pronouncing his case almost hopeless from the first ihis morning he died, and was: con veyed to the last earthly tenement, where the troubles of life cease. In his death the circumstances arc pe culiar: the wish expressed, and the means taken to contract the disease stated, were a new method of getting rid of life. BALTIMORE, PITTSBURG AND CONTINENTAL R.
