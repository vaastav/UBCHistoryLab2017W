STILL ANOTHER ONE. VslbMa Reports Rsd Btvsnt It Iks War Oflle*. LONDON, Dec. 18.—Gen. Metheun's report from Modder river shows that he met with a serious check Monday and suffered great losses: "Our artillery shelled a very strong position held by the enemy on a long, high kopje, from 4 p. m. until dusk Sunday. It rained hard last night. The Highland brigade attacked at day break on Monday the south end of the kopje. The attack was properly timed but failed. The guards were ordered to protect the Highlanders' right and rear. The cavalry and mounted in fantry, with a howitzer artillery bat tery, attacked the enemy on the left and the guards on the right, supported by field artillery and howitser artillery. They shelled the position from, day break, and at 1:1S I sent the Gordons to support the Highlands brigade. The troops held their own in front of the enemy's entrenchment* until dusk, the position extending, including the kopje, for a distance of six miles towards the Modder river. Today I am holding my position and entrenching myself. I bad to face at least 12,000 men. Our loss was great." GATACRE'S EXPLANATION. Sappl.mantarjr Aecnnnt mt tha British Dafaat at StormtMrg- LONDON, Dec. 18. —The war office has received the following from General Forestier Walker: "Cape Town, Monday, Dec. 11.— Gatacre reports as follows: 'The idea to attack Stormberg seemed to promise certain success, but the distance was underestimated by myself and the local guides. A police man took us round some miles and con sequently we were marching from 9:80 p. m. to 4 a. m., and were landed in an impossible position. I do not consider the error intentional. The Boers com menced firing from the top of an un scalable hill and wounded a good many of our men while in the open plain. The Second Northumberlands tried to turn out the enemy but failed. The Second Irish Fusiliers seised a kopje near and held on, supported by the mounted infantry and Cape police. Thtf guns under Jeffreys could not have been better handled. But I regret to say that one gnn was overturned in a deep nullah and another sank in quick sand. Neither could be extricated in the time available. 'Seeing the situation I sent a dis patch rider to Molteno with the news. I collected and withdrew our force from ridge to ridge for about nine miles. The Boer guns were remarkably well served. They carried accurately 0,000 yards. Iam holding Bushman's Hook and Gyphergat. Am sending the Irish Rifles and Northumberland^ to Sterksstrom to recuperate. The wound ed proceed to Queenstown. The mist ing Northumberlands number 860, not 806, as previously reported.'" WILL DELAY ADVANCE. Oataera Bad Fraaab Maat Await Beta* foraamaata. LONDON, Dec. 12.—No further news has been received to smooth the mys tery overhanging General Gatacre's re treat from Stormberg. He has not yet forwarded the promised additional mes sage and the censorship has prevented the correspondents from explaining the matter. Until General Gatacre haa given his explanation it is felt that con siderable allowance must be made for the extreme difficulty of getting intelli gence in a country whose inhabitants are in strong sympathy with the enemy. Stormberg is described as a stronger position than 'Laings Nek. The only road winds through lofty hills and flanking is impossible. Colesburg is also said to be an almost impregnable position and as no troops are available to reinforce the columns acting in those directions it becomes evident that CataoaPa Mlafortana or Xrrot (rill delay the invasion of the Free State perhape some weeks. It is ex ceedingly probable that he will be compelled to retire on Queenstown and to wait for reinforcements which can hardly reach him until Sir Charles Warren's division arrives at the Cape. The first detachments will sail Satur day next. Even if General French is not compelled to retreat he will be obliged to pause in his advance.

MANILA, Dec. 18.—General Young re ports-the rescue of Brutnp of the Ne vada regiment and Edwards of the gunboat Yorktown, who have been held prisoners by the Filipinos. Gen eral Tino, conveying the American prisoners north, is hotly pursued. Ag uinaldo is a fugitive in the mountains. His body guard has been destroyed and Gregoric del Pilar killed. General Conception has surrendered. The Lepanto province has been cleared of insurgents. The navy co operated with the army on the -west coast. Two Thousand eight hundred released Spanish prisoners are coming to Manila. WORSE THAN INDIANS. fisUsMsf Sipprcwiiv Filipino Baadlla Not ES17 of Solntleau MANILA, Dec. 18.—Colonel Smith, with a detachment of the Seventeenth infantry, surrounded and captured in a village near Malasqui a party of guerril las who had made their headquarters there. The party included the band which assassinated seven officials at Malasqui for friendliness to the Ameii cans. All are insurgents who became ban dits when disintegration of the Filipino army began. They kept the country around Malolos quite in a state of ter ror for several weeks and committed iiS murders in less than that number of days. When they were caught they were promptly sent to General Mac Arthur's headquarters at Bftyambang by train. It is expected that they will be speedily tried and shot or hanged as an example, if convicted. The whole country north of San Fer nando and between San Fernando and Manila, except within the permanent line of troops around the city and the closely patrolled stretohes of railroad, Swarm With Saeh Baada. Probably they will be increased by (General Pilar's army, many of whom are making their way south to Cavite province. These people, for the most part, suc ceeded in dodging General Grant, Colo nel Bell itnd Colonel Hood's troops, who are scouring the country for them. They devote their energies to ambush ing commissary wagons and to picking up soldiers who leave their commands. Every day some wagon train is fired upon or some soldier disappears. The policy of these ruffians is to make the country uninhabitable for Americans and to frighten natives into refraining from giving assistance to the Ameri cans, as well as to compel the inhabit ants to support the insurrection. Only a small proportion of the insurgent arms have been surrendered and the problem of suppressing this guerrilla warfare is anything but easy of solu tion. Some of the American officer* think it worse than fighting Indians. TAKEN BY MACARTHUR. Baportad That Filipino General Ale Jaadrlao Hu 8avr«adtr«d. MANILA, Dec. 11.—An expedition headed by the battleship Oregon left Manila for Subig Saturday night. It is reported that the Filipino 00m mander, General Alejandrino, with his staff, has surrendered to General Mac Arthur, and there is also a rumor that Alejandrino is at Alguar, suffering from a wound received in a fight be tween insurgents and bandits, and that he will be given an opportunity to sur render and will be properly cared for. The records of the treasury of the so-called Filipino government, together with a quantity of paper money and an other Nordenfeldt, have been found at Mangataren, GENERAL PILAR KILLED. Commander of Agnlnaldo'. Bodyguard Dies Fighting. MANILA, Dec. 11.—General Gregorio del Pilar, commanding Aguinaldo's bodyguard, was killed by Major Priton C. March of the Thirty-third infantry in a fight 18 miles northwest of Cervan tes Dec. 8. According to reports which General Young obtained from escaped Spanish prisoners at Vigan several days ago, Major March left the coast, where he was pursuing Aguinaldo, and encoun tered General del Pilar on a fortified train. They fought for four hours, during which time 70 Filipinos were killed. The American loss was 1 killed and 6 wounded. The Spaniards report that Major March is still pursuing the insurgents. OLANGAPO OCCUPIED. Naval Itatlsa ID Soblf BAY In the Hands of InerlMni. MANILA, Dec. 12.—The advance guard of General Grant's command, under Major Spence, arrived at Olangapo, Subig bay, during the night of Dec. 9, which place was occupied with little resistance, the enemy fleeing.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.—The feature of the opening day in the debate on the currency bill in the house was the speech of Mr. Dolliver of Iowa. It was characterized by all the wit and elo quence for which the Iowan is noted and hold the members without regard to party for more than two hours. Mr. Dolliver declared that the last doubt of the Republican party as to tho Wisdom of enacting the gold standard into law bad been dissolved, by the ex­ perience of the business world daring the past three years. He scored Mr. Bnraa and generally ridiculed the **&&-*•*?&* "r & leged prophecies of the Democrats in 18M. Mr. De Armond (Mo.) was the heavy gun on the Democratic side. He warned the Democrats from the West that they could not deceive their constituents in the coming election that they had yielded to the judgment of their col leagues in caucus. Mr. Overs treat opened the debate for the Republicans and Mr. Maddox (Ga.) replied to him. Mr. McClellan (N. Y.) was the only other speaker. He an nounced his opposition to the bill on the ground that it would contract the currenoy, extinguish the bank notes and enhance the value of coin bonds. THOSE TISSUE BALLOTS. Xoataekp Conrt of Appeala Thar Are Illegal. FBANKFOBT, Ky., Dec. 11. —The tissue ballot case from Ohio county has been decided and the decision is concurred in by four of the seven judges of the court. The court held that all ballots should be printed on white paper suffi ciently thick that the printing cannot be distinguished from the bade, and if ballots are used at an election which do not substantially comply with the law, the eleotion is not conducted as re quired by law and is invalid. The opinion of the court comes too late to affect the decision of the state election commission, but sets a precedent for the state contest board. Another decision announced by the court of appeals has an important bear ing upon the late state election in Ken tucky. The decision was a ruling mak ing perpetual the writ of prohibition issued against Judge Tomey of Louis ville, restraining him from- interfering with local elections by writ of man damus. He was charged by the Demo crats with arbitrarily issuing the writs. IT 

SHIFTS THE ISSUE. Oomoeratio Opinion of the Bffoot of GoM Standard Lotlilatloa. CHICAGO, Dec. 11.—-Judge Johnson, chairman of the Democratic executive committee, says: "The introduction of the Republican monetary bills shifts the issue before the country. The decision will be for or against the single gold standard in stead of for or against silver as it was in 18U6. "The Democratic party will niaintain its stand in favor of free and unlimited coinage of gold and silver at the ratio of 16 to 1, independent of the consent of any foreign nation—in short, independ ent bimetallism. The discussion in congress over the Republican caucus gold standard measures will be the be ginning of the discussion which will be carried on thronghont the cam paign." CRITICIZED THE KAISER. Remarkable Ineldont During the Do* bate on the Naval Bill* BERLIN, Dec. 13.—'The event of the day has been Dr. Lieber's criticism in the reichstag of Emperor William's speech at Hamburg. The spectacle of this cautious leader of the most impor tant group in the reichstag—the section which will decide the fate of the naval bill—thus severely blaming the kaiser, is almost without parallel in German parliamentary history. It was all the more notable because Count von Bal lestrem, president of the reichstag, upheld the dignity of the chamber and maintained freedom of speech against the protest of the imperial chancellor. Parliamentary circles are all agog over the incident and it has not improved the chance of the naval bill.

The Betrothal Ring. The early history of the wedding ring is not easy to trace, as it was apt to be confused with the betrothal ring. This was once the more important of the two, for in the days of our forefa thers the betrothal was the great cere mony and marriage only the ratifica tion of the contract. Then a spouse was a betrothed person, and to espouse was to be betrothed. The ceremony of espousal or betrothal was celebrat ed with all possible solemnity as the contract of a future "eternal (ond of love." No doubt the reason for thus solemnizing an engagement was that In times of violence and lawlessness the church, thought It needful to pro tect the woman and therefore made the betrothal so sacred that a violation of the contract was punished with ex communication. A betrothal service was used, which stIU forms part of the French and Italian ritual, and. Indeed, the first part of the Anglican mar riage rite down to the woman's "1 will" Is al«1 ice.

CARBONADO, Wash., Dec. 11.—The accident in shaft No. 7 of the Carbon Hill coal mines, 40 miles east of Ta coma, although not so serious as first reported, caused a loss of 82 lives. There were 76 men at work at the time of the explosion and 44 have reached the surface alive. Five of these are in a serious condition. Governor Rogers and a relief train were early on the scene. The origin of the accident is yet un known, but it is supposed that miners working between the 800-foot and 600 foot levels broke into the old mine workings, which are filled with gas. An explosion followed as soon as this outpouring gas came-in touch with the first miner's lamp. The concussion was sufficient to blot out the lives of nearly half the miners in shaft No. 7. Governor Will Investigate. Governor Rogers will conduct a searching examination as to the cause of the explosion. He telegraphed State Mine Inspector Owens, now at Spo kane, to attend the inquest and ex amine witnesses himself. The question of insufficient ventilation of the mine in accordance with the state law will be thoroughly gone into. The Carbon Hill mines are owned by the Pacific Improvement company, an offshoot of the Southern Pacific Rail way company. The output of 100 tons a day is shipped to Tacoma by rail, and thence to San Francisco and Oakland. The mines are the second largest in the state and have been in operation for nearly 20 years. Most of the victims were Finns, Poles and Welsh^ WORK OF_QUR MINTS. Aanaal Report of Olreetor Roberta Made Foblle. WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—Mr. Roberts, the director of the mint, in his annual report, says: The mints and assay offices operated upon more bullion in the aggregate and a greater coinage was executed during the last fiscal year than in any previous year. Original deposits of gold were slightly less than during the previous year, amounting In value to $148,497,' 190 against $147,698,194 in the fiscal year ended June 80,1898. Domestic deposits were the largest in our history, amounting to $76,262,887 against $69, 881,120 in the preceding year, but theri was a falling off in foreign coin and bars. The coinage of gold was the greatest in our history, amounting to $108,177,180. The coinage of silver dollars from bullion purchased under the act of July 14, 1890, was $18,254,709, against $10,002,700 in the preceding year, and the coinage of subsidiary silver $9,466,877.65 against $6,482,804.
