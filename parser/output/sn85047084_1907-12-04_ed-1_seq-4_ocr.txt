THE PACIFIC COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER, HONOLULU, DECEMBER 4, 1907. "4 THE Pacific Commercial Advertiser A MORNING PAPER. NEW WALTER G. SMITH - - - - - - - - - - - EDITOR WEDNESDAY : : : : : DECEMBER 4 THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The President in his message says that business conditions are souul and that it is foolish to hoard money and create a financial stringency. How valiu a statement this is, may be learned from a reading of the Statistical Record of the Progress of the United States, whieh came to hand yesterday. Among the pertinent faets which it -resents is that the money in circulation in this country oa July 1, 1907, was two thousand, seven hundred and seventy-three million dollars an increase in one year of thirty-seven millions. There were thirteen billion dollars in the American banks on that date as against five billions in 97. These are almost incomprehensible totals in current funds and they show how easily good times could be restored by a resumption of public con fidence in fiscal institutions. r This confidence, however, the President does not encourage by his pledge to proceed with the warfare upon the corporations which he regards as dangerous, the public not knowing bow iar his discoveries of "successful dishonesty" may go. President Roosevelt renews his proposal to aid American sea-going vessels with the object-lesson-of the Oceanic company's withdrawal since the defeat of the Subvention bill to aid him: and failing that, he suggests the slight relief of a relaxation in the shipping laws as applied to the traffic between Hawaii and the mainland. The paragraph in favor of' opening of Fearl Harbor for the use of the largest deep-water vessels and the suitable fortification of these islands may be accepted as a pledge that the Navy Department will not oppose the harbor plans as had been feared. ' . , The further proposals of the message, which contain nothing sensational will be found rather fullv set forth in our Associated Press dispatches. - -f- THE 

PROJECTED NAVAL STATION. It is reported that a strong influence is being felt in Washington against building a naval station here and in favor of establishing it at some port of Southern California. This influence is neither military nor naval; it is political and is more concerned in pleasing .a constituency than in defending a coast. The argument for a Hawaiian naval base is thoroughly strategic. By making this place a Malta, no enemy on the western side of the Pacific would dare attack the coast cities, leaving a fortified Oahu and a protected fleet in his rear. Indeed, no Asiatic foe could make war at a distance of five thousand miles; if he had designs on San Diego or San Francisco or even on Puget Sound, he would fear to leave his long line of sea communication open to the attack of warships from this base. He would have to reduce Oahu and take this harbor first. Hence, if Oahu is built up into an American Malta, the Pacific coast ports are safe. On the other hand, if this locality is neglected, as it would be if Congress were to abandon Pearl Harbor, the first act of an enemy would be to capture us and use Honolulu and Pearl Harbor, if open, for naval purposes, temporarily fortifying the place until time could be found for perma uent defenses, with mines, mortars, submarines, siege gups of the kind used in the field before Moukden and battleships. Then three times the sum of money required to make Oahu impregnable would have to be spent in safeguarding the mainland Pacific ports, and even then the coast Could be frequently raided by the vessels of a great power. Should the government, in spite of all this, conclude to build its naval station on the Pacific littoral, Southern California could not expect to get it. Visdom would suggest a more central point, like San Francisco; or, if Great Britain were counted as a possible foe, the station would naturally go to Puget Sound. But GTeat Britain has every reason to keep the peace with America. Economy is also a factor. "With a view of the future utility of Pearl Harbor and Honolulu as a naval base, the Government has spent and is ex pending, large sums of money here upon sites for forts and a naval establish ment. ' Under these circumstances if a choice of location is to be debated in Congress, the friends of Hawaii ought to have much the best of the argument. V : The President ean not keep out of the papers. When things were dull he got up a debate over race suieide and then the strenuous life. After the flurry pubsided he went for the postal officials and when that row quieted down he invited Booker Washington to luncheon. One fine morning General Miles got near enough to the President to receive a brick and the sport seeming good the railroad men came in for a few. During a drowsy afternoon the President thought he might as well reform English spelling and this trifling effort kept the press buzzing the name of Eoosevelt for six weeks. A set-to with the " nkture-fakers" of whom Jack London is a type followed and now, having prepared the fleet to go around the Horn, and given fat army officers the horseback ride of their lives, the President has removed the assurance 'In God We Trust," from the coinage. This last venture has brought so "many brick-batted protests that Mr. Roosevelt begins to breathe easier ami eat more. : . 

BOOKS AT TIE PUBLIC LIBRARY The following "books, have recently been received at the Honolulu library and will be ready for circulation Thursday, December 5. X. F. English Embroid- Dutch Pottery and Complete Poeti- The rumor that the Cunard boats may ply on the raeific, between Van couver and Australia, is not necessarily an idle one. .Long' ago the White Star line got into the habit of sending its out-of-date Atlantic vessels here and, with the British-Australian trade what it is, and what it might be, the Cunard people could not be blamed for following suit. In the present state, of com jtetition on the Atlantic, fine boats go. into second and third place speedily. The greyhound of yesterday is the dachshund of tomorrow. Far belter boats than any we now have in the Pacific have been outclassed on the Atlantic within the past five years anil to such as these the expanding field of British trade in the "Pacific should be and verv likely is, an inviting one. . , : It is well known to the Japanese and through them to the planters, that a man who claims to represent the American Federation of Labor hart been-at work among the Oriental field hands in this Territory trying to' foment strife. The Honolulu Trades and Labor Council denies that the Federation hast such an agent in this field and it may be right; though it has not vouchsafed this journal any correspondence pn the subject which it may have had with head quarters, in support of its disclaimer. We concede, however, as was fsuggested by the Japanese Consul, in his interview on this subject, that the man may 1 e a private grafter. He is read at face value, however, by the local Japanese press. Kendrick, try. 197. Knowles, W. P. Focelain. 1905. Longfellow, H. W cal Works. 1902. McMahon, A. B. With Wordsworth in England.. 1907.

The President did well to entrust the work of digging the Panama Canal to army engineers, fnder the civil administrating the excavators slowly worked up a record from 3,000 cubic yards of earth per month to S30,000; and last March, when Chief Engineer Stevens resigned, he said that the removal of 1.000,000 cubic yards per month in the dry season, would satisfy all concerned. Yet Colonel Goethals, the army engineer in charge of the canal, reports that, despite the handicap of a rainy October, he disposed of l.S44,471. cubic yards of material during that period. At this rate of progress the digging will be completed in fifty-three months, though it will take a period beyond that in which to complete the locks. -f An afternoon paper says: "The St. Louis team is telling a story full of tragic humor, of how gigantic, gate receipts were secured for their games in Japan and they got $3 each. The Japanese managers thought it would be an insult to pay the college boys from Honolulu. The fact is that it wouldn't have been an insult at all. The members of the team wouldn't have lt.fren offense if handed a few hundred yen. Not at all. Japanese were mistaken about the college bovs. Evidently, the By their vote tonight on the Brown Salary Grab proposition, the Super visors will make it clear whether they belong to themselves and the public or to the County Attorney's office.

Saint Saens QUARTERLY CONVENTION YOUNG PEOPLE'S UNION The regular quarterly convention of the Young People's Union will be held n the Mafciki Japanese' church, corner Pensacola and Kinau streets, on Fri day evening, December 6, at half-past seven. A program of exceptional In terest has been arranged, with repre sentatives fr6m five different national ities and seven societies taking part. Up to the present time the Young People's Union has been composed of both senior and junior societies, but on Friday evening the seniors will present the juniors with a beautiful banner and launch them as a distinct junior union, organized and officered and ' fully equipped in every respect. Already nine societies are on the roll, and from the fine spirit of enthusiasm and appareht capacity of the executive committee this number may soon be almost doubled. Experience is show ing that junior societies are more ag gressive and resourceful and less in clined to grow weary, than their seniors, and because of this.it is felt the new arrangement will be beneficial alike to the churches and the young people. ..
