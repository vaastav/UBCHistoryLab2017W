A Fuller With Clean Cut Opinions. r^Well, we want, just as a matter of form, to hear from the court of inquiry in the Schley investigation. We have heard from the people already. Another English naval vessel has gone to the bottom. If the bloomin' Britishers can't keep their tubs afloat on an ordinary cruise what would become of them if a manlike Schley got after them? Who says trusts are unkind? One of them is going to sell coal to the Germans for a dollar and a half a ton less than we have to pay. Of course this is just because the people over there can't afford to go any higher. The people of Buffalo seem to be determined to pay the bill rath er than to have any further talk about it, and it speaks volumes for -the people of Buffalo that they are able to pay it, although the Fan-American failed to pan. Wiien were you out to church service last? Stop and think the matter over. If you are not a re gular attendant, go next Sunday. Maybe it'll seem hard to do it, but go—go anyway. It'll do you no harm, may do you some good, and you'll fell better for having attend ttd. Never mind the clothes you wear, you'll be made welcome. Go to church next Sunday. Well, Teddy Roosevelt isn't it so slow if he really means what he says about government aid in irri gating the arid west. But he .would havts shown good judg ment by recommending the stop ping of such leaks 'in the treasury as are caused by the Philippine fiasco and other colonial ventures, and using the money for the pro­ motion of some such beneficial plan as his irrigation scheme. Our Philippine expense account for one year would construct a string of reservoirs that would suprise It's easy—this being an editor. Only last week THE UNION'had an offer from some sort of a bureau down in Washington to furnish as all our editorial matter for ten cents per week! Think of getting brains at ten cents per week!—A sort of a free coinage of opinions for so small a sum. Thanks 1— THE UNION turned the generous o2er down. When we can't edit our paper we will get out of the business.However, some of the boyS right here in the Hills bit at the bait and are using this "can ned goods'' as orginal. No kind reader, THE UNION has not "renounced Bryanism,"as one suspicious reformer judged from our leading, editorial of last week. But as heretofote, THE, UNION does not believe in attempting an im possibility by making the cam peiga cry ol 1904 "imperialism and Philippine independence." There are real i#Sttes lo"tie to, real eviels to eorribat and live questions to champion^ Imperialism is not one of thefts Neither^ is the question of PMHppine iadejfendence. Don't C1MS|^s. Ujcnotfw*& "deserter" bec&i ^pillions free- THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's message to congress takes its place among the historic documents of the nation as one of the longest of its kind. In some ways it is an able and commendable paper, and in others it is not. It lacks the ag gressiveness and fearlessness of its author, and in this regard failed to meet the expectations and hopes of many. It indirectly favors the ship subsidy steal, though it does not openly advocate the passage of that piece of proposed legislation. It is framed with an eye to a "good Lord and good devil" policy on the trust question, in that it opposes meddling wifh or altering the present high tariff law—the ack nowledged breeder of trusts and combines. President Roosevelt's ideas look ing to the crushing out of anarchy and giving the federal courts juris diction in cases of assassination or attempted murder of federal of ficials is commendable and will meet with the hearty endorsement of every lover of law and order. On the question of trusts the president advises the "utmost caution" in legislation, with no specific recommendation to con gress as to what should be done to protect the masses from trust ex tortion. Yet he favors govern mental supervision and control of great corporations "within reason­ able limits." He fails to suggest the "limits" and leaves the prob lem as nearly unsolved as it was before he discussed it. The tariff, which breeds trusts and fosters them in their robbery, he declares should be left alone, as any change would be '-unwise." There is lit tle satisfaction or hope for relief in this section of his message. If made in sincerty and the hon­ est cooperation of congress can be secured, his recommendation of government construction of reser voirs and main ditches with a view to irrigating the arid lands of the west is most commendable. Whether or not it is a bid foi western support in 1904 time will tell, but THE 

UNION heartily hopes that it is made in all sincerity and that something substantial will be dpne* in the matter. Millions of acres which today are vast wastes could be reclaimed throught irriga tion and made to blossom as the rose. Houses would dot the hills and valleys of the west where to day are found few evidences of twentieth century civilization. The president's?! recommen dations regarding the construction of the Nicarauguani caaal, the sus taining of the time-honored Mori roe doctrine and the laying of a trans-Pacific cable are commend able aad will meet with hearty support of democrats and republi cans alike~in congress. They are truly American measures. His view as to the closer 1 and more rigid restriction of undesir able immigration, as well as his favoring the .ra-eattctment of the Chinese exclusion law, are worthy the support of the official repre sentatives of both political parties. He does not declare point blank for the proposed ship subsidy steal, but "favors the upbiidingr of thd American merchant marine." The fault with the subsidy bill has been that this "tip-building of the merchant marine'' at government Wpense as proposed by Senator Hanna, would simply be a gift of millions of the peoples money each j/sar to the shipping trust,of which Prepare for Cold Weather Before it Arrives .Kir it Corner Main and Sixth Street, RAPll) CITY, si. D. chairtablc enough to give this trust—the most gigantic and far reaching of its kind in the world millions of dollars annually to "en courage" it. The president's recommennation as to doing all possible to keep in toxicants from the aborigines in this country and calling upon other nations for co-operation along the same line abroad, is a proper posi tion. Yet he might have properly gone a [step further and included other classes of our population. An Indian is bad enough at best, but let him get hold of a jug of whiskey and he's—well you khow! In many ways President Roose velt's message is a commendable one, but on live issues like trusts and the policy which forms their basis and furnishes them their protection it is somewhat disap pointing, when one stops to con sider the characteristics which have brought position and Men's Clothing- $ pays Co Crabc at tlje 1 tyre.
