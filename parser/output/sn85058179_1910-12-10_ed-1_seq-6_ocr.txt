ANNUAL DOCUMENT IS READ Conservation, Ship Subsidy and For tification of Panama Canal Lead ing Topics Discussed Has Little to Say About Tariff. Washington, Dec. 6. Economy In government affairs Is the keynote of President Taft's annual message read before both houses of congress today. The message approximates 411,000 words and Is one of the longest ever submitted by a president. Conservation of the public domain, hip PUbsidy, fortification of the Pana ma anal and the continuation of the pre! nt tarilf board are the leading subjects touched upon, lie also re Views the work of the various gov ernment department! and concurs In recommendation, tending toward the bettering of the service, made by sev eral of the members of his cabinet. Economy Is Urged. In dwelling on the urgent need for economy In government expenditures, the president aaya: "Kvery effort has been made by each department chief to reduce the estimated com of his department for the ensuing fiscal year ending June 30, 1912. I any this In order that congress may understand that tie sc estimates thus made present the smallest sum which will maintain ttie departments, bureaus and offices of the government anil meet Its other obligations under existing law. and that a cut of these estimates would re mit In embarrassing the executive branch of the government In the performance of Its duties. This remark does not apply to the river and harbor estimates, except to those for expenses of maintenance and the meeting of obligations under author Ize.l contracts, nor does It apply to the public building hill nor to the navy build- ing program. Of course as to these eon gn ss could withhold any part or all of the estimates for them without Interfer- ' Ing with the discharge of the ordinary ob ligations of these functions of Its depart ments, bureaus and offices. "Against the estimates of expenditures MMM,013.12, we have estimated receipts for next year $GMl.ono,000, making a proba ble surplus of ordinary receipts over or dinary expenditures of about $50,000,000, or taMng Into account the estimates for the. Panama canal, which are 

BB,M0,M?.BX and which will ultimately he paid In tionds. It Will leave a detlclt for the next vi'iir of about $7,000,000, If eongresa shall conclude to fortify the canal " Wants Forest Limitation Removed. On the subject of conservation he de votes considerable space to forest, coal, oil and gas, phosphate lands and water power sites. Aa to the reservation of finest lands he savs: "The law now pro hibits the reservation of any more forest binds In Oregon Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming, except bv ict of congress. I am Informed by the depnrtment of agriculture that the gov- j ernment owns other tracts of timber land In these states which should he Included In the forest reserves. I recommend to congress that the limitation herein Im- I posed tie repealed. "Congress ought to trust the executive ' to use the power of reservation only with respect to land most valuable for foreat purposes. Ourlng the present administra tion fiO."r0.000 acres of land largely non timbered have been excluded from forest reserves, and 3.S0O.00O acres of land prin cipally valuable for forest purposes have been Included In forest reserves, making a reduction In forest reserves of non tlmtiered land amounting to 2,750.000 aerea." Wants Canal Fortified. Regarding the Panama canal, the presi dent aaaerts that unless unexpected ob ataclea arise the waterway will be com pleted well within t'me limit of .ianu arv I. 115. and within estimate of coat. $37.r. 000.000. Suggestions for levying of tolls and management are made, and re gifllng fortification of the canal, he says: "Among questions nrlslnir for present aohitlon Is the decision whether the canal ihall be fortified. I have already stated In the congress that I strongly favor for tification and I now reiterate this opin ion and ask your consideration of the subject In the light of the report already before you made bv a competent hoard. "Failure to fortify the canal would leave the attainment of both these alms In the position of rights and obllgatlona which we Should be powerless to enforce Sad which could never In any way he ab solutely safeguarded against a desperate and Irresponsible etiemv " Ship Subsidy. The president urges such action aa he believes will Inereaae American trade abroad, and says:: "Aii'ittfer Instrumentality Indispensable to thr uahaaapsrad and natural develop ment of American commerce ,s merchant marine All maritime and commercial na tions recognize tl,,- Importance of tlds fa- tor The greatest commercial nations, our eempattton, IsalOUSly foster their merchant murine. perhaps nowhere la the nod for rapid und direct mall, paa aenger and fn-lght communication quite o urgent aa between the United States and I ..i tin America. We can aerure In no other quarter of the world such Imme diate lii in tits In friendship and com merce aa would flow from the eatabllah ment of direct llnea of communication with the countries of I .a tin America ade quate to tneet the requirements of a rap Idly Increasing appreciation of the reci procal dependence of the countrlea of the wuatern hemlaphere upon each other'a producta, sympathies and assistance. "I alluded to this most Important aub Ject In my laat annual message. It has often been before you and I need not re capitulate the reaaona for Ita recommen dation. I'n less prompt action be taken the completion of the Panama canal will find thla the only great commercial na- tlon unable to avail in International mirl- tlme business of this great contribution to tin- means of the world's commercial In tercourae." Criticism of the Tariff. In the spice devoted to the tariff the president says: "The schedules of the rates of duty In the Payne tariff act have hi i n subjected to a great deal of criticism, some of It Just, more of It unfounded, and too much misrepresentation. The net way adopted In pursuance of a declaration by the par ty Which Is responsible for It that run. turns Mil should . ,1 tariff for the pro tection of home Industries, the measure of the protection to lie the difference be tween the cost of producing til" Imported article abroad and the cost of producing It at home, together with such addition to that difference as might give a reasonable profit to the home producer. The basis for the criticism of this tariff ll that In respect to a number of the Schedules thn declared measure was not followed, hut n higher difference retained or Inserted by way of undue discrimination In favor of certain Industries and manufactures, Lit tle, If any. of the criticism of the tariff has been directed atjalnst the ptot-ctlve principle above stated hut the main body of the criticism has bi sn based on the at tempt to conform to the measure of pro tection was not honestly and sincerely adhered to." The president nlso refers to the aptvilnt tnent of a board of experts to Investigate the cost of production of various articles Included In tile subclinics of the tariff, and concludes: "Whether or not the protective policy la to tie continued, and the degt of protec tion to be accorded to our home Indus tries, are questions which the people must decide through their chosen rent-, s-nta- tlves. Bui whatever policy Is adopt-d. It Is clear that the necessary legislation should he baaed on an Impartial, thor ough and continuous studv of the facta." Recommends Parcels Post. The adoption of the pan Is post la again adopted. On this subject President Taft says: "With respect to the parcela post. I respect fultv recommend Its adop. tlon on all rural delivery routes, and that 11 pounds the International limit be made the limit, of carriage In such post. The same nrgument Is mnde against the parcels post thnt was made against the postal savings bank that It Is Introduc ing the government Into a business which should be conducted by private persons and Is paternalism. The pos'ofTlce depart ment has a great plant and a great or ganization, reaching Into the most remot hamlet of the t'nlted States, and with this machinery It Is able to do a great many things economically that If a new organisation were neceeeary it would bo Impossible to do without extravagant ex penditures." Department of Justice. DtSCUSStng the affairs of the department of luetics, the president says: "I Invite especial attention to the prose cutions under the federal law of the so called 'bucket shops,' and of those schemes to defraud In which the use of the mall Is an essential part of the fraudulent conspiracy, proaecutlons which have saved Ignorant and weak members of the public and are aavlng them hun dreds of millions of dollars. The viola tions of the anti-trust law present per haps the most Important litigation before the department, and the number of cases lied shows the activity of the govern ment In enforcing thnt statute. "In a special message last year I brought to the attention of congress the propriety nnd wisdom of enacting a gen eral law providing for the Incorporation of Industrial and other companies engaged In Interstate commerce, nnd I renew my recommendation In that behalf." The crying need In the t'nlted States of cheapening the cost of litigation by simplifying Judicial procedure nnd ex pvdlting final Judgment Is pointed out nnd action looking to correction of theae evils la urged. The president recommends an Increase In the salaries of federal fudges. Postal Affairs. In regard to postal matters the presi dent points with pride to Ita present effi cient management and the recent reduc tion In the deficit. The present unre Btrlcted franking privilege cornea In for comment with a suggestion for the adop tion of better methods for Its regulation. Abolish Navy Yards. The president calls attention to certain reforms urged by the secretary of tho navy which he recommends for adoption, and continues: "The secretary of the navy has given personal examination to every navy yard, and hu.s studied the uses of the navy yards with reference to the necessities of our fleet. With a fleet consider. ibly less than half the size of that of tho l'.ritlsh navy, we have shipyards more than double the number, nnd there are aeveral of these shipyards expensively equipped with modern mchlnery, which, after Inveatlgatlon the aecretary of the navy believes to be entirely useless for naval purposes. lie asks authority to abandon certain of them and to move their machinery to other places, where It can be made of use." Speaking of our foreign relatlnna the president says: "During the past year the foreign relatloua of the United States have continued upon a basis of friendship and good understanding. "The year has been notable aa wltnesa Ing the pacific settlement of two Impor tant international rontroveralea before tha permanent court of The Hague. "The arbitration of the fisheries dispute between the Pnlted States and Oreat Ilrltaln, which haa been the aource of nearly continuous diplomatic correspond ence since the fisheries convention of 1818, baa given an award which Is satisfactory to both parties. Thla arbitration Is par ticularly noteworthy not only because of the eminently Just results secured, but also because It Is the first arbitration held under the general arbitration treaty of April 4, 190S, between the Pnlted States and Ok at Ilrltaln. and disposes of a con I troversy the settlement of which haa re- elated every other resource of diplomacy I and which for nearly ninety years haa been the cause of friction between tWO j countries whose common Interest lies In i maintaining the most friendly and cordial ' relations with each other. President Taft makes a few recommen datlona for chaugea In the Interstate com merce law and aaya: "Kxcept aa above, I do not recommend i any amendment to the Interstate com j merce law aa It atanda. I do nut now I recommend any amendment to the antl ! truat law. In other worda. It seema to me that the existing legislation with reference to the regulation of corpora tion and the restraint of their buslneaa has reuched a point where we can stop for a while and witness the effect of the vigorous execution of the laws of the statute books In restraining the abuses which certainly did exist and whl.ih rouaed the public to demand reform " NOT
