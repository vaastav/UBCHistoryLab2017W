WOMEN - TAKE HEEO OF HillAEE BILL Investigate Unsatisfactory Conditions at Jefferson ville and C. Point. JEFFERSON VI LI.E. IND., Dec. 2 "nt measure that will come before the ci'laUire In which the women of the state are greatly interested, is a bill to stop t!T reckless marriages that are pettfnrmed at JeftV rsonville and Crown Fomt. The women's clubs and organi zations have been making an investiga tion of the conditions prevailing hrc, and in Crown I'oint, as regards mar riages and they have arrived at the con clusion that In many instances the mar riages arc simply a jest and a mockery of works and for that reason fhey will sk that the system be abolished. Woman to Ask Aid. Three bills have been introduced in as many sessions of the general as sembly that would put a stop to the practices, but they have nil been de feated. It is the intention of the wom en of the state to ask the aid of the Governor and. the leading politicians of both political parties to assist in wiping out this disgrace. The good Indiana women feel that if the legislature is really anxious to do something to add to Indiana's great reputation as a state, H can do so by blotting out the reck less manner in which marriages are per formed in Clarke and Bake coifhtics. Marriages are regarded by all Chis tTan nations as n basis of civilized so. ciety, of sound morals and domtli- af fections. It has more to do with the 'morals and civilization of a people than any other institution. Ret With Leg-Ulatura. The legislature may prescribe who may marry, the age at. which they n-arry. the procedure and form of es sential to constitute marriage; the du ties and obligations the relations create; Its effect on the property rights of both, prffnt and prospective; and the acts which may constitute grounds for Its dissolution.

ROBERT 3. BENDER (TTnitad Press Staff Correspondent.) WASHINGTON, D. C, Dec. 2. President Wilson's "re-adjournment" message to congress today is his answer to critics of his peace trip and post-war economic plans. Convening at noon for the "short session" members of the house and senate were in such a frame of mind toward the chief executive as to make his appearance little short of dramatic. In fact the necessity of replying in some measure either directly or indi rectly to the most sordid criticism of his plan to attend the peace conference in Europe and clearing up his position on readjustment rroblems, such as rail road and wire control, opening of neural resources and broadened educational op portunities for the youth of the nation. The president's speech follows: 'The year that has elapsed since I j last stood before you to fulfill my con stitutional duty to give to congress from time to time information on the state of the union has been so crowded with great events, processes and great results that I cannot tops to give you an adequate picture of its transactions or of the rar-reacnir.g cnangs vrnicn has been rought in the life of our na tion and of the world.
