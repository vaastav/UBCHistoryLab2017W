THE CHRONICLE. WEBSESDAT. DECEMBER (!.. ISM. CHEOMflE For 1S64. AT THE OLD PRICE FOR CASH IN ADVANCE! The old Westekn- Reserte Chronicle which has been a. weekly visitor to thou sands of happy fire side in Trunibull and adjacent Counties, for nearly fifty years, hopes to be welcomed by the children end grandchildren of its eaily patrons for a century or two more. The present pub lisher of the Chronicle will spare no pains to continue it acceptable to all its old and faithful trends, and to render it an agreeable companion and counsellor to as many new ones as may choose to make its acquaintance. Now is the time for new subscribers to begin, and for old ones to renew their subscriptions. These flush times are paradoxical as it may seem almost ruinous to papers published on -the old terms in vogue for generations among country printers. We mean the credit system. It will not work these times. It takes cash, and lots of it, to buy paper and ink, and to hire labor. 1 1 is all cash, cash, cash no long credits allowed, for everything can be sold now for the ready pay. How then can the country publisher trust out his paper ta low paying subscribers, year after year, when the cash is required of him f It can't be did. We hare become tired of trying to do it. Hereafter our motto shall be "Cash in advance, or no paper." We have been thinking the matter over, and are satisfied it will be better for both subscriber and publisher. We will have lut era price O.ve Dolus axd Fiftt Cents ix Abvascx.' This rule will be inflexible. We are determined to try it for one year, let it work as it may. We do not wish, if we can avoid it, to raise the price of our paper, although we think the general advance in almost werything else would justify us in so doing, but we yc-ill adopt and adhere to the advance system. There fore we give notice that no name will in future be added to our subscription list, unless the order is accompanied with the money. We will not send out Py pa pers after the 

FIRST OF FEBRUARY, i ISC4, that have not been paid for in ad vance. The third business year of the present firm commences at that time, and as several weeks will elapse between now aud then; we think ample notice will have been given to all. We hope to re tain the greater part, if not all, .of our (wo thousand subscribers; but to do 60, it will be absolutely necessary tot those in arrears to call and settle up, either by note or cash, and pay for a year in ad vance. Those that fail to do this, must expect to have their names erased from our list, and their accounts placed in the hands of a collector. Now, friends, one and all, give us your material aid and sign of approval In this enterprise. Honey is reported plenty. . The Chbosicli is offered very cheap. Just think if it at a cost of less than three fents a week. No man should be without his county paper, when it can be had at so trifling cost. Bear in mind our new terms: One Dollar and Fifty Cents in Advance. All 1 papers stopped when the subscription ex pires. Those who have accounts against us, for wood, 4c, will please call and get re ceipts. Should we by mistake, erase the names of any who hare paid, let us know at once. it The 7th Regiment's Wounded. . In the list of wounded of the 7th Reg iment at Ringold, Oa., we observe the name of J as. II. Merrill, of Co. H. Jim my had been in nearly every battle in which the 7th had participated, and was one of the very few of that veteran, and battle riven regiment that escaped un hurt through Us many perils. Put his good fortune could not save him amid the tempest of iron bail that cut down Cols. Creighton and Crane, and every commis sioned officer but one, in the regiment. We hope eur brave printer soldier will soon be himself again. . Among the wounded of Co. J. 7th Reg iment, we also observe the names of Sar- geant Vanwye, privates Charles Clenden ing, Wright, Wfbster Johnson, Otis Martin, L. P. Gates and Wm. Bennett. Of the 100 men that left Warren in Co. H, at the formation of the Seventh Regi ment, but 13 of the original number were left previous to the late battle in Georgia. Of that 13, several are on the list of wounded. ' . ' ; U e see there U proposal made by some of the special friends of the 7th to -bring it home." We doubt whether the few braves that remain of its number srould not prefer to serve out the few re maining month of their three years term, t.ut we certainly think their return could not be objected to by any but themselves and if it is their wiu to corpe home, God speed them. a Congress Congress met on Monday.

WARREN, Dec. 7th. 1863. Ed. Chronicle-. Why is it, that nothing is being done in this County toward fill ing our quota of volunteers under the last call of the President; Governor Tod hss twice appealed to the County Militarv Committees of the State, urging them to take hold of the matter, yet so far as know, our County Committee has done nothing. No especial eflort is being made by any one, to recruit volunteers. Again I ask why thi apathy Have the people no interest in the matter Ilav the monied men in Warren, and all over the county, nothing at stake? Other States are offering large bounties over and above the U. S. bounties, and in some localities in this State, the citizens are taking hold and raising bounties, and thereby securing volunteers I am confident if the citizens of Warren would raise a fund, sufficiently large enongn, to pay a bounty of three hundred dollars to each man who would volunteer or if drafted, go himself, or procure a sub stitute, government would get her full quota of men from this township. A man then, by volunteering, would get, not only the township bounty, but also the U. S. bounty, making in all the handsome cum of six hundred and two dollars. Butisome msy say, they would not be volunteering out of pure patriotism, but to obtain the bounty. In answer 1 would say that those who would volun teer, would exhibit far more patriotism than those who would object to giving the bounty It is the duty of the older class of peo ple to take hold of this matter. The younger ones who are subject to draft, cannot urge others to enlist, because they would be tamed upon, and asked why they did not enlist. It is true, that as a class, in this town. those men who are between thirty-five and forty five years cf age, can better go to war, can better leave their families, have more at stake in the speedy and successful termination of the war, than married men under' thirty-five years of age. i.et such then, if not willing to go to war themselves, give to those who will go. 1 hose also who are over torty-nve years old, have a vast dea at stake, and ought to feel an interest in this matter, although not subject to military duty. If they "have property, they ought to real- alize its value depends upon the success ful termination of the war; they should feel they have peaceful possession of it, only because the army is standing guard between it and the enemy who would destroy it; they should see the necessity of so reinforcing the army that it may be able to destroy that enemy. If they haye but little property they should still feel interested in maintaining our Government until it has crashed its foe, for the happi ness and prosperity of their children, for generations tp come, depend upon the termination of this struggle, All feel that what I have said is true, bgt still think what they desire will be accomplished, and all will end right, in time, without any effort on their part. They know the younger class are sub ject to military duty first, and long before is exhausted the warwijl be ended.- If this should be so,' no one who has a spark of love for his country, who has any sympathy for those who are standing be tween him and the enemy, ought to re fuse to give freely of his means to those who are willing fo gp jnfp (he field Let there be a fund raised then, so that each man, who will enlist, or who, when drafted, will go, or get a substitute, can be paid a bounty of three hundred dol- besides the U. S. bounty. It will take only about ten thousand dollars in this township. But you may say this fund cannot be raised. It can be raised, and in a fea day too. Cull a meeting, appoint a Committee to go to every man in town. The wealthiest will head the list with a subscription of from three to five hundred dollars, and so on down, every man according to his means, and patriotism. All who are sub ject to draft will give, and in sums from ten ilQfjars ana upward; ana thus can a fund be raised sufficiently large enough to give a good bounty to any one who will go into the field. All this can be done in two or three days if the people will take hold of it. Shall it be done? Shall we procure the requisite number of men from this town? Or shall we let pur men go elsewhere to enlist, and other places get (he credit of it? VOX. The Situation at Knoxville. - gnoxville is on the north bank of the Holston River. Its defences consist of large fort on the south side of the river, against whioh the first demonstration of the enemy were made some two weeks ago. Failing, they crossed the river, and Longstreet invested the town . on the north. The defenses (n that direction consist mainly of t wo -forts n command ing hills. One of them was. assaulted on Sunday,- and if they had taken it, they could have swept the town with artillery and Burnside would probably have been driven out A Cumberland Gap dispatch of the 2d the Cincinnati Commercial, has these items : I conversed this evening with a citizen who left Enoxville Monday morning. The destruction of property was principally confined to that portion of the town west the Cumberland Gap mad, and north the railroad. About forty bouses, in eluding the depot building, have been destroyed. The Crosier Building, on Gay street, (Gen. Burnside's headquarters,) was made an especial target, by the rebel batteries. It was not bit, though a shell exploded within a few feet pf (Jen, B Gen. Burnside, a n amber of times, per If in sonally sighted and discharged guns on battery.

Burnside offered the rebels an armistice from ten o'clock in' the morning till five o'clock in the after noon to remove their wounded and bury their dead. It was accepted. The rebel officers and prisoners express astonish ment at the strength of the works and the valor of our men. Our loss will not reach 80 all told. Over 50 of this consists of members of the 27th Kentucky, who were csptnred on the south side of the river. Whether Longstreet is satisfied with the impregnability of Knoxville we know not. What his next movement will be may be predicted with confidence. Be sides 250 prisoners, we have three battle flags, one of which was planted on our works at one time A Cumberland Gap dispatch of the 3d announces Longstreet's whole cavalry force on the Lunch Kiver, within twenty miles of the Gap. There bad been sharp fighting at Walker's Ford, twenty miles from the Gap, between our forces under Gen. Foster and the whole of Longstreet's cavalry. t osterattempted to cross Clinch Kiver. but was repulsed, with a loss of fifty. He, however, captured four pieces of artillery. It is supposed that Long street's cavalry are endeavoring to keep open his road into Virginia, and that he will hardly dare to make any demonstra tion on the Gap, which is regarded im pregnable. After the battle at Jonesville, the 16th Illinois cavalry left their two surgeons back to care for the rebel wounded. On the 2d tbey were found murdered! One was Dr. Halstead, formerly of Ohio. Ma jor Beam, with a portion of the ICth, was sent from the Gap on the id. on a mission of vepgeance. The 129th Ohio was re ported engaged on the id. Kesult not known. The Chesistbf of Medicine. Among the special delight which have so richly repaid our visits to New England was the inspection, it was our privilege to make of Dr. J. p. Aver & Co.'t Laboratory, at Lowell. Although we knew by bere-say, that it was large, yet we were surprised when we came into view of its real mag nitude, and still more by the extent and complication of its truly immense busi ness, the whole massive structure is in fact one vast chemical laboratory, in which the processes of this wonderful art are constantly going on. Medico-chemical science has found that the curative properties of any substance exist in some one oy more of its component parts. Thus the remedial ettects ot opium are due solely to the morphia it contains. although this it but one eighteenth part of its weight; the other seventeen parts are gum, extractive and inert or offensive matter. Dr. Ayer's system separates the medical properties of each substitute em ployed and we here show the process by which the virtue of each remedial agent are chased through the alembics until they come out completely pure at last, These concentrated, purified medical properties, or virtues, are finally combin ed together to produce the remedies which have made themselves a reputation for unrivalled excellence, all over the world. Not only does the ' Doctor dis claim all secrecy in his art and explain every process and every particular, but ue uiajuiama mat luia a tue uijiy proves? people can be supplied with the best possible remedies for the treatment of dis ease.

CRAB ORCHARD KENTUCKY. Extra from a pdraja letter. The great question of life and death with us as a nation, is soon to be solved. the American people falter in the sup port of the Government in the enforce ment of the draft, and the vigorous pros ecution of the war, our Government goes down, and with H the last hope of the world for a free Government. Then des pots will sleep tranquilly unmoved by gi ant free America. I have too much con tinence in the American people, too much confidence in Divine "Providence to be lieve that we. shall fail in this glorious struggle for liberty. ' But should the peo ple prove recreapt p their trust imposed them, and basely abandon the glorious cause in which they have been so long engaged, they are fit only for slaves, and only deserve a tyrants yoke.

PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 4. The U. S. Supply Steamer Massachu setts arrived at the Navy Yard this morn ing irom luarleston Hit Tuesdav at 4 o'clock. She brought back the Marine Battalion comprising 200 men, and several refugees from St. John's river, Florida, who rep resent that State to be in a starving con- umon. She also brought one of the rebel nartv who attempted to blow uo the Ironside. Robert Scott by name, formerly of New xorK. Lieut. West reports that Gen. Gilrr.ore still continued to throw shells into Charleston at the rate of 20 per day, and it was evident that they were doing con siderable damage. The shells were seen to burst at night. All the inhabitants of Charleston hud been moved to the rear of the city. The firing on Sumter had ceased, and Gen.XSilmore was turning his attention to the forts inside the harbor. A terriffic fire was kept up on Fort Johnson. On the reception of the news of Grunt's victory on Tuesday, our army and navy fired grand salutes. Soon afterwards the rebel batteites opened fire which was vigorously going on when the Massachu setts left. The rebels had heretofore kept a hospi tal flag flying from the Moultrie House, and of course our forces respected it, and avoided firing upon it, but a few days ago the rebels commenced tearing the Moul trie Uouse, and revealed to our forces a formidable battery which had been erect ed behind it, while it was under the pro tection of the hospital flag. No flag now floats over Sumter, and only an occasional shot is fired from its ruins. Poisoning Mules. Messrs. William Kenick and Charles Machir, living near Circleville, have been feeding 112 mules on the farm of the for mer, and last week lost thirty-seven by poisoning.

Though the sympathizers with the reb els are cautious about expressing them selves to Union men, yet their children most innocently expose them. There are few boys over eight years of age who do not talk of the war and the generals; and they say what they hear at the fireside. Union boys tell what they thus hear, and never say anything their parents are ashamed of; but the Copperhead lioys "tell tales out of school'' which betray L. l p . - me ireirurnius Kiuril oi lljeir pureriL". This was particularly noticeable on the occasion of John Morgan's escape; as these boys freely expressed their joy at the for tune of the traitor General. Their pa rents should be more careful about talk iqg before their children, as they have not yet fully learned "the ways of the world." Proclamation by the President. .

The Fiiiludelihia AartA American give-, some excellent advice to those who wish to invent money. It is well for all who j are in funds to heed the counsel: "Tho' money has been temporarily scarce, capi- i ital coiitiimes abundant; ami the recent "tutut-le ! the stock market has brought capitalists to a realizing sense of the un reliable character of many of the securi I lies U It in. It is greatly to the credit of the Government that its loans, of all the se-iiriii-s d.tily dealt in on the mar j ket. Inite iiiHintained their integrity ot price better tliHii almost anything else. Its Five-Twenty year six per cent, loan, the int.-t.-t on which is promptly paid in krold. hrts Im t-n ? ubscrite"l to, all through the pressuie in the niofiey market, at an !vrra ut more than two millions per day. And what is not the lenst gratify- inj2 f irt in connect iuti with thedaily larae subsetiptioiiitiithis popular loan, scarcely any ot it is returneil to the market tor ale. It is taken for investment, aud is held with unfaltering confidence in it9 re liability. And why should it not be? It is seen that the Government now, after two year- of the mmt gigantic war that the wot Id has ever known, experiences no dittiulty in commanding the necessary mentis to prosecute it, or in paying regu- larly the interest in gold as it falls due. it tin-, can be done while the war is being waged, who ctn anticipate any difficulty in readily accomplishing it when the war shall be ended? What better investment then, for capital, than the "Five-Twenty" Government loan? But if anv doubt, let him refer to the statistics fui nit lied by the census tables of the various nations of the wot Id The facts which they present will prove the most satisfactory mode of dispelling the numberless gloomy appre hensions which are being continually con jured up by those who are disposed to ex aggerate the extent of the calamity occa sioned by our rebellion. A reference to the state of imvt of the prosperous na tionaof the old woild clearly disproves such a position, and shows that the high est conditions of national advancement have not been materially afi'ecied by the extended wars in which those nations have been immetuorially engaged, and that a heavy national indebtedness has not proved an unmitigated evil. "For instance, Great Britain, France and the Netherlands will undoubtedly be conceded to represent the highest pros perity that has ben attained by any of the European nations. And vet no na tions have been called upon to endure fiercer or more prolonged wars, domestic and foreign, than they. The effect has been, unquestionably, to incur an enor mous nttional indebtedness; but neither their wars nor their indebtedness have had the effect to destroy their elasticity, nor to check the progress of their gen eral prosperity. The result would -have been different, probably, if these nations had been falling into decay, instead of being, as they really were, in a state of development; and in this respect their case resembles our own, with enormous advantages in our favor. These nations, while undergoing the trials of war, were oppressed by the evils of an immense ex odus of their people, caused by the dens ity of their population, the impossibility to provide occupation for them., the low price of labor, and the scarcity of territo ry. Compared with our own country. they possessed slight room for future de velopment; they were settled in every pait, and no vast territory lay invitingly open to encoursge enterprise and settle men t. Their great problem has ever been what to do with their surplus population, which, in its turn, has sought new fields for adventure and self support in coun tries like our own, where an illimitable territory awaits to be developed, and where incalculable resources invite indus try and energy. The encouragement to be derived lrom these tacts and compar isons of circumstances is very great, and to the mind of any dispassionate reasoner is conclusive that the course of this great country is onward and upward, and that its credit will live unimpaired to the end. The Springfield Republican relatja how a Massachusetts copperhead was p swish ed at a New York hotel the other day. As Gen. Sickles was hobbling through the hall on his crutches, the precious speci men of the snake insulted him with loud and coarse denunciations of the war, and nil who fought on the loyal side of it. The cripple turned and faced the cow ard, demanding an apology and retrac tion. They were denied. Other words followed; whereupon the hero of Chan cellorsville and Gettysburg, shouldered his crutch and showed now fields were won by breaking it, over the head of this degenerate son of Adam and of Amherst.
