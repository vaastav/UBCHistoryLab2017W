Of the firht with Gen Grant, he saja: "After a long and severe battle, in which jrreat carnage was inflicted on him, some of 'our troops inexplicablv abandon! positions of ereat strength and by a disorderly retreat compelled the com m ander to withdraw the forces elsewhere suc cessful, and finally to retire with his whole armr to a position some twenty or thirty utiles to the rear. It is beliered that if the troops woo yield ed twtbe assault bad fought with the valor which they hal displayed on previoua occasions, and which was manifested in this battle on the other parts of the line, the enemy would hare been re pulsed with verj jrett slaughter, and our coun . try would hare escaped the misfortune and the army the mortification of the firet defeat that has resulted from misconduct by the troops." This retreat of Bra compelled Longstreet to fall back from, Knoxville. .;;.' f OKKIGX RELATIONS. On this poiotthe message says: .-- jt "1 regret to inform you that there has been no improvement in the state of our relations with foreign countries since my . message of January last. On the contrary, there has- been, a -still greater divergence in the conduct of Eutopean natious from that practical impartiality .which alone deserves the name of neutrality, and their action, in some cases, has assumed a character . positively unfriendly. "You have heretofore been informed that, by common understanding, the initiative in all action touchin the contest on this continent had been left by foreign powers to the two frre.it maratime nations of Western Europe, and th it the govern ments of the two nations had agreed to take no measures without previous concert. The result of these arrangements has, therefore, placed it in the power of either France or England to ob struct at pleasure the recognition to which the Confederacy is justly entitled, or even to prolong the continuance of hostilities ou this side ot the Atlantic, if the policy of either could be promo ted by the postponement of peace. Each, too, . thus became possessed of great influence in so shaping the general exercise of neutral rights in Europe as to render them subservient to the pur pose of aiding one of the belligerents to the det riment of the other. I referred, at jour last ses sion, to some of the leading points in the course pursued by professed neutrals, which betrayed a partisan leaning to the fide of our enemies; but events have since occurred which induce me to renew the subject in greater detail than was then deemed necessary." The message then r-ecapitulates the action of England in reference to the observance of the bjpekade, and discusses at length the validity of that action under international law. In this con. nection it says: "The intimation that relations with these States 'would be discreditable because they are slave holding, would probably have been omitted if the official personage who lias published it to the world lud remembered that these States were, when colonies, made slaveholding by the direct exercise of the power of Great Dritt in, whose de pendencies they were, and whose interests in the slave trade were then supposed to require her colonies should be made slaveholding." It is complained, also, that England has acted unfairly in permitting the Federals to obtaiu sup plier in that country, while denying the same privilege to the rebels. The course of Frauce is thus referred to. "It is not in ray power to apprise you to what extent the Government of France shares the views unreservedly avowed by that of Great Britain, no published correspondence of the French Government on the subject having been received. So public protest nor opposition, how ever, has been made by his Imperial Majesty againt the prohibition of trade with ns, imposed on French citizens by the paper blockade of the United Suies, although I have reason to believe that an unsuccessful attempt was made on bis ' part to secure the assent of the British Govern ment to a course of action more consonant with the dictates of public law and with the demands of justice toward us." As to the right of the rebels to claim recogni tion as a nation the me'sage says: --- "For nearly three Tears this Government hss exercised unquestioned jurisdiction over many millions of willing and united people. It has met and defeated vast armies of invaders, who have in vain sought its subversion. Supported by the confidence of its citizens, the Confederacy has lacked no element .which distinguishes an inde pendent nation, according 'to the principles of public law. Its legislative, executive and judi cial departments, each in it? sphere, have per formed their appropriate functions with a regu larity as undisturbed as in a time of profound peace, and the whole energies of the people have been developed in the organization of vast ar mies, while their rights and liberties have rested secure under the protection of the courts of jus tice. .Th's Confederacy U either independent or it is a dependency of the United States, for no other earthly power claims the right to govern it. Without one historic fact on which the pre tension can rest, without one line or word of tre itv or covenant, which can give color to title, , the United States have asserted, and the British Government has chosen to concede, that these sovereign States are dependencies of the Govern ment which is administered at Washington. Greit Britain has accordingly entertained with, that Government the closest and moat intimate relations, while refusing, on ltd demand, ordinary amic-ibie intercourse with us; and has. under ar rangements m-ide with the other nations of Eu rope, not only denied our just claim of admission into the family of nations, but interposed a pas sive though effectual bar to the acknowledg ment of our rights by other powers. So soon as it bad become apparent, by the declarations of the British Ministers in the debates of the British Parliament, in July last, that Her Majesty's Gov ernmeot wan determined to persist indefinitely in a course of policy which, under professions of neutrality, had become subservient to the designs of our enemy, I felt it my duty to recall the Com-: missioners formerly accredited to that Court, and the correspondence on the subject is sub mitted to you." President Dtvis sees no remedy for all these evils. He says; , "I am well aware that we are unfortunately without adequate remedy for the injustise which we luve suffered at the bands of a powerful na tion, at a juncture when our entire resources are absorbed in the defence of our lives, liberties and independence, against an enemy possessed of greatly superior numbers and material fos√∂erces." Claiming no favor, desiring no aid. oodscious of our own ability to defend our own rights against thejitmo't ff -rta of an infuriate foe,- we had ,' thought it not extravagant to expect that assist ance woeld be withheld from our enemies and that the conduct of foreign nations would be marked by a genuine impartiality between the " belligerent. Is wm not snppooed that a-pro--feaal neutralitv would be so conducted as to jus tify the Foreign Secretary ol the British nation in explaining, in correspondence with our ene mies, how the 'impartial observance of neutral obligations' by her Majesty's Government lias thus been exceedingly advantageous to the cause of the more powerful of the two contending par ties.' The British Government raav deem this war a favorable occasion for establishing, by the temporary acridce of their neutral rights, a pre cedent which snail justify the future exercise of those extreme belligerent pretensions that their naval power renders so formidable." ' ' ' 

FISAJCXS. ' Of the condition of the finances, the message says: "A pronrot and efficacious" remedy for 'the presett conrrtion of the currency is necewary to the successful performance, of, the function's of government. Fortnnatelv the resources of our country are so ample, and the spirit of our people so devoted to its emuse, that they are ready to make any necessary contribution. Relief is thus entirely within oar reach if we have the wisdom to legislate in such manner as to render available the means at our disposal." It ii''d that the Treasury notes now in circu lation amount to more than six hundred millions, threefold more than is demanded by business. Of the effect of this, the message says: '.'I need not enlarge upon the evil effects of the condition of thing.' They are unfortunately but too apparent. In addition to the difficulty pre seuied to the necessary operations of the Govern ment and the efficient conduct of the war, the most deplorable of all its results is undoubtedly its corrupting influence on the morals of the peo ple." To remedy these evils, prompt and decisive action must be taken, and taxation upon all the property under the control of the Government is recommended. Further, there must be a "com puldorj reduction of the currency to the amount required by jhe business of the couotryi,' by con version into bonds- whose interest shall be promptly paid. The rebel army, according to the messsge is in better condition than e.w before, but men are sttll greatlv needed: . . "In view of the lae coiwcriotion recently or dered bv the enemv, and their subsequent call for volunteers, to be followed, if ineffectu I, by a still further draft, we are admonished that no effort trmst be spared to add large! j to our effect ive force as promptly as possible. The sources of supply are to- be 'found by restoring to the army who are improperly absent, putting an end to Substitution, moouTinc tne exemption taw, restricting details, aud placing in the miiks euch 6f the able odied men now. employed as wagon ers, nurses, cooks, and other employes who are doing service for which the negroes may be found competent." 1 he message recommends the organization of and Invalid Corps, and urges that all new re emits be assigned to veteran organizationsjustead of being formed into distinct companies and regi ments. As to the Ordinance Department, it is said: n" r - i i "The reports from the Ordnance and Mining Bureaus are very gratifying, aod the extension of our means of supply of arms aud mnuitions of war from our home resources has been such as to Insure our ability soon to become mainly, if not entirely, independent of supplies from foreign countries. The establisoment for the casting of guns and projectiles, for the manufacture of small arms and of gunpowder, for the supply of nitre from artificial nitre beds, and mining operations generally, have been so distributed through the country as to place onr resources beyond the reach ot partial disaster. . .. . exchange or raisoxcss. The suspension of the exchange of prisoners is laid, of course, at the door of . the Federal au thorities: i ; "A. systematic and concerted effort has been made to quiet the complaints in'the United States of those relatives and friends of the prisoners in our bands who are unable to understand why the cartel is not executed in their favor, by the groundless assertion that we are the parties who refuse compliance. ; Attempt are also made t shield themselves from the execration excited bv their own odious treatment of our officers and soldiers now captives in their hands, bv mis state ments, such as that the prisoners held by us are deprived ef food. To this last accusation, the conclusive answer has been made that, in accord ance with our law and the general orders of the department, the rations of the prisoners are pre cisely the same in quality and quantity, as those served out to our own gallant soldiers in the field. and which have been found sufficient to support them in their arduous campaigns, while it is not pretended by the enemv that thev treat prisoners by the same generous rule. By an indulgence, perhaps unprecedented, we have even allowed the prisoners in our bands to be supplied bv their friends at home with comforts not enjoyed by the men who ciptured them in battle. In contrast to this treatment, the most revolting inhumanity has characterized the conduct of the Uuited States toward prisoners held by them. - One prominent fact, which admits no denial or pallia tion, must suffice as a test. 1 be officers of our army, natives of Southern and semi-tropical cli mates, and unprepared for the cold of a Northern winter, have been conveyed, for imprisonment, during the rigors of the present season, to the most northern and exp-'sed situations that could be selected by the enemy. 'There, beyond the reach of comforts, and often even of news from home and fa mil v, and exposed to the piercin cold of the northern lakes, they are held by men who cannot be ignorant of, even if thev do not design, the probable result.' How many of our unfortunate friends and comrades, who have passed unscathed throngb du merous battles, will perish on Johnson's Island, under the crnel trial to which they ere subjected, none but the Omni cient'ean foretell." THE KtBKL 

NAVY. The Report of the Secretary of the Navv gives in detail the operations of that Department since January last, embracing information of the disposition and employment of the vessels, o tra cers and men, and the construction of vessels at , Richmond, Wilmington. Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, Selma, and on the rivers Roanoke, Neuse, Pedee, Chattahooche and Tombigbee; the accumulation of ship , timber and supplies, and the manufacture of' ordnance stores and equipments. The foundries aud workshops have been greatly improved, and their capacity to sup ply all demands for heavy ordnance for coast and harbor defence is only limited by our deficiency in the requisite skilled labor. The want of such labor and of seamen seriously affects the opera tions of the Department. The skill, courage and activity of our cruisers at sea cannot, be too highly commended. They have inflicted heavy losses on the enemv without suffering a single disaster, and have, seriously damaged the shipoing interests of the United States by compelling their foreign commerce to seek the protection of neutral nags. POST OKNCE. ,pi The Pistmaster General reports the receipts of that Department for the fiscal year er.ding the 3uth of June last to have been $3,337 ,e51 UJ and the expenditures for the same period $z.bb:W4 67. The statement thus exhibits an excess of receipts amounting to $1175,084 44, in stead of a deficiency of more than a million of dollars, as was the case in the preceding fisca year. It is gratifying to perceive that the De partment has thus been self sustaining, in accord is nee with sound principles, and with the express requirements of the constitution that its expenses should be p-iid out of its own revenues alter the 1st March, 1S53. COXPICT OF TOE EXEMT. I cannot close this message without again ad verting to the savage ferocity which still marks the conduct of the enemy in the prosecution of the war. After their repulse frooi the defences be t√∂re Charleston, they first sought revenge by aa abortive attempt to destroy the city with an in cendiary composition, thrown by improved ar td.erv, from a distance of four miles. Failing m this, they changed their missiles, but fortunately have thus :ar sueceeoea only m kt√ºin? two wo men in the city. Their commanders, Butler McNeil and Turchin, whose horrid barbarities have made their names widely notorious, and evervwhere execrable, are still honored and eher ished by the authorities at Washington. The first named, after having been withdrawn from the scenes of bis cruelties against women and prisoners of war, (in reluctant concession to the demands of outraged humanity in Europe,) has just been put in a new command :t Norfolk wbere helpless women ana children are again placed at his mercy. . ; , Nor 1ms less unrelenting warfare been waged by these pretended 1iiends of human rights and libreties against the unfortunate negroes. Where ever the enemy hare been able to gain access they hve forced into the ranks of their armv every able-bodied man they could seize, ami have either left the aged, the women and the children, to perish bvstarration, or hive gather ed them into camps where they have been wasted by a frightful mortality. Without clothingkor shelter, olten without food, incapable, without ropervipton, o' taking the mostordiimrv precau U jns against disease, these helpless dependents aecustomdd to bare their wants supplied by the foresight of their masters, are being rapidly ex terminated wherever brought into contact with the invaders. By the Northern mau, on whose deep rooted prejudices no kindly restrained in fluence is exercised, they are treated with aver sion and neglect. There U little hazard in pre dicting that, in alt localities where the enemy have gained a temporary foothold, the negroea, who under our care increased sixfold in Dumber since their impertation in the Colonids of Great Britaiu, .wiil have reduced by mortality, during the war, to sot more than oue half their previous number.' . . Information on this subject is derived not only from our own observation arfd from reports of the negroes who succeed in escaping from the enemy, but full confirmation is afforded by state ments published in the northern journals by hu mane persons engaged in making appeals to the charitable for aid in preventing the ravages of disease, exposure and starvation among the negro women and children who are crowded into encampments., r . . s The frontier or ur conntry bears witness to the alacrity and efficiency with which the general orders ol the enemy have been executed, in the devastation of the farms, the destruction of the agricultural implements, .the burning of the houses, and the plunder of everything moveable. Its whole aspect is a comment on the ethics of a general order ismed by the United States on the 2 Ith of April, 1663, comprising "Instructions for the government of the armies of the United States in the field," and of which the following is an example: "Military necessity admits of all direct destruc tion of life or limb of armed enemies, and of other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoid able in the arme contesss of the war; it - allows of the capture of every armed enemy, and of every enemy of importance to the hostile Gov ernment, or" of peculiar danger to the captor; it allows of all destruction of property and obstruc tions of the ways and channels of traffic, tvavel or communication, and of all withholding of sus- teiauce or means of life from the enemy; of tha poropriation of whatever an enemy s country ffords necessary for the subsistence and safety of the artsy; and of such deception as doea not involve the breaking of good faith, either posi-. tively pledged, regarding agreements entered into during the war, or supposed by the modern law ' f war to exist. Men who take up arms against . one another in public war" do not cease, o-j this . account; to be moral bingsr responsible to one another and to God. ..': ' - ' The striking contrast to these teachings and practices presented by our army when invading rennsvlvanw, illustrates the moral character ot our people. Though their forbearance may have" been unmerited andv unappreciated by the enemy. it was imposed by their own self respect, which forbade their degenerating irom Christian war riors into plundering ruf√ºans. assailing the prop erty, lives and honor of helpless non combatants. f their conduct, when' thus contrasted with the inhumau practices of our. foe,-fail to command : the respect and sympathy ot civilized nations in our day, it cannot Jail to be recognized by their less deceived posterity. . . :' cosctrsios. " The message concludes as follows: "The hope last year entertaineJ of an early termination of the war has not been realized. Could carnage hare satisfied the appetite of our enemy for the destruction of human lile, or grief have appeased their wanton desire to inflict hu- - man suffering, there has been bloodshed enough on botn sides, and two lands have been sum ciently darkened by the weeds of mourning to in-' duce a disposition for peace. 'If unanimity in a people could dipel delu sion; it has been displayed too unmistakably not " to have silenced the pretense that the southern States were merely disturbed by a factious insur- ' rection, and it must long since have been ad mitted that they were but exercising their re served right to modify their government iu such ' manner as would best secure their own happiness. But these considerations have been powerless to allay the unchristian hate of those who, long accustomed to draw large profits from a union ith us, cannot control the rage excited by the conviction that they, by their own folly, destroy ed the richest sources cf their prosperity. 1 hey refuse to listen to proposals for the only peace possible between us a peace which, recognizing the impassable gulf which divides us, may leave the two peoples separately to recover from the injuries inflicted on both by the causeless war now waged against us. Having begun the war' in direct violation of their Constitution, which forbade the attempt to coerce a State, they have been hardened by crime, until they no longer attempt to veil their purpose to destroy the insti tutions and subvert the government and inde pendence of .these States. W'e now know that the only reliable hope for peace is in the vigor of our resistance, as the cessation of their hostility is only to be expected from the pressure of their necessities. "The patriotism of the people has proved equal to every sacrifice demanded by onr coun try a need. We have been united as a people never were united under like circumstances be fore. God has blessed us with success dispropor tionate to our means, and under His divine favor our labors must at las? be crowned with the re - ward due to men who have given all they posscs- ed to the righteous defense of their inalienable rights, their homes and their altars." THE PIIOGITES Or THE WAR. Annual Iteport of tne Chief. GcneraUIn Gen. Halleck opens his very lengthy repo; by taking up the Army of the Potomac at the time Gen. McClellan was relieved by Gen. Bumside at W nrteMtOD, Va., on the 7th of November, 1862. Gen. Halleck urged Gen. Burnside to continue his pursuit of Lee toward Richmond, but Gen. Burukide declined, desiring to move to ralmouth, yet tiiully consented to cross the Rappahannock by the upper lords and occupy J? redericksburg. Gen. CurusldeV final march to and occupation of Falmouth whs never authorized or approved by the authorities iu Washington. The plan which the Present aseuted to was to cross the river by the uper fords and occupy , the town. This . Gen. Buroside did not do. - Gen. Sumner esked : permission to do so when he arrived at Falmouth, the river being fordable, but it was refused. In the meantime Lee got there and intrenched. The delay of the poutoons, which should have been at Falmouth when Gen. Burnside arrived there, is explained by the fact that instead of be ing at Washington, where they were supposed to be, they were at Berlia and Harper's Ferry, and had not been moved, because Jie officers in charge did not receive Gen.: Buruside's order to move them to Washington. The battle of Fred ericksburg occurred December 13. Through an alleged misinterpretation of orders. Gen. . Frank lin's attack on the left was only a reconnoissance in force, and the attack of Sumner and Hooker on the right was unsupported. We were repulsed with the loss of 1,138 killed, 9,105 wounded, and 2,078 missicg. Gen. Burnside has never made any official report of these operations.- He says: "The fact that I decided to move from War renton on this line, rather against the opinion of the President, the Secretary of War, and your self, and that you hare left the whole movement in my hands, without giving me orders, makes me the more responsible." On the 25th of January Gen. Hooker relieved Gen. Burnside. Gen. Halleck merely refers in a sentence to the campaign of General Hooker, says he has no official date of it, and then re marks: "It is also proper to remark in this place that from the time he was ptaced in command of the Army of the Potomac until he reached Fairfax Station, on the 16th of June, a few days before he was relieved from the command, Gen, Hooker reaoned directly t-i the President, and I received instructions directly from him. I rsceived no official information of his plans, or of their execu tion." . .... Early in June Lee moved up the lUppthan nock into the Shenandoah Valley. Hooker fol lowed on an interior line. Neither army eould obtain much iu formation of tile other because of the intervening mountains. Winchester aud Martinsburg were mere on1 post, nod order were given on the 11th of June to withdraw the gar rison to Harper's Ferr) ; but the.-e orders were not obeyed; and ou the 13ih Winchester was attacked and captured. On lb 2eMi of June, at Frederick, Md , Gen. Hooker, at his own request, ws relieved from the command of the Army of the Potomac. . "Our force at Harper's Ferry at this time was supposed to be shoot 11,000. It was incorrectly represented to Oen. Meade to be destitute of pro visions, aud that be must immediately supply it or order the abandonment of the place. Ac cordingly, a few hours after he assumed com mand, he assented to an order drawn up by an officer of Gen. Hooker's staflf, directing Gen.' French. to seud .7.0UU . men of the garrison to Frederick, and with the remainder estimated at 4,000 to remove and escort the public property to WadhuiKtou. This order, based on erroneous rflpresenUtious, was not known in-"Washiogton till too late to be countermanded. - It, however, was not entirely executed when Hen.' Meade very judiciously dbected the icoccupaiion of that im portaut point."- Gen. Halleck then describes the battlo of Gettysburg; ascribes an error to Gen. Sickles, which came near being fat 1 to us, on the second day of the fight But the rebels were finally detente!, and "to Gen. Meade belongs the honor of a wt.l earned victory in one of the greatest and best fought tattle of the war." The retreat ot Lee and the pursuit by Meade are described, closing with this: "In the meantime Oen. French had reoccupted Harper's Ferry, destroyed the enemy's pontoon train at WiHutmspoi t and Falling Waters, aud and captured ita guards. Halting a day at Mid dletown, Gen. Meade crossed the South foun tain, and on the 12th found the enemy occupying a strong position on the bight of Mareh Ruu, to front of Wiliiaioeport' -"Instead of attacking Lee in this, position, with the swollen waters of tbe Potomac in his rear, without any means of cross ing his artilletj, and. waeQ p defeat nut have caused the surrender of his entire army, be was allowed time to construct a pontoon bridge with lumber collected from canal boats and the ruins of wooden bouses, and on the morning of the 14th his army had crossed to the south side of the river- His renr 'guard, however, was attacked by our eavitlry, and suffered conaidercble loss. Thus ended the rebel campaign north of the Potomac, irom which important political and military re sults had been- expected. Our own loe in this short campaign had Ifeeii very severe, viz: ,834 kilhui, 13.7U√ú wounded,-au4 .653 niiasing -iu all 23,182. We captured 4 guns ,44 standard, 13,621 prisoner aud 2√ñ,17tf small Arras" General Halleck then briefly recounts the mi nor operations of the Army of the Potent ti up to the battle of Rappahannock S'atioe, but gives no new fact " : : , The operations in Western.., Virginia lave been mainly of a defensive character, in repelling raids and breiking up the guerilla bands. The force in the Department of North Caro lina during tbe pabt year has beeu too small, for any important operations against the enemy. But Hill's operations against Foster ia North Carolina, as well as Longstreet's against Peck, in Virginia, were entirely uusucces&ful. General Gil more's operations before Charles ton are recited at some length, with this com ment: : . - j i v : "General Gil mote's .operations Lave been characterized .by great professional skill and boldness. Ae has overcome difficulties .almost unknown in modern sieges, Indeed, his opera tions on Morris Island constitute almost a new era in the science of engineering and zumterv. Since the capture of Frts Wagner and Gregg he has enlarged these works, and established power ful batteries which effectually command -Fort Sumter, and can render efficient aid to any nvai attack upon Charleston.- They also control tbe entrance of tbe harbor.". v In. the Department of tbe Gulf, operations have been successful. The preliminary move menu to the siege of Port Hudson are given at engtn. Un the tith of Julv the place uncondi tionally surrendered., i We captured b233 prison era, al . pieces of - artillery, two steamers, 4..41K) pounds of car non powder, 5,000 small arms. 150, 000 rounds of ammunition, lue. Our loss from the 3d to the 30th of May, inclading the assault on the 27th, as reported, was about 1,000. l be Department of .tbe i ennesaee ia next re viewed.'. The object of Gen. Grant's campaign was the opening of the Mississippi, in conjunction with the army of Gen. Banks, Gen. Sherman's nrst attack upon Vicksburg failed because tbe place was more strongly fortified than had been supposed. - The troops were then withdrawn, and the capture of Arkansas Post accomplished on the 11th ef January. We captured at the latter place 5,000 prisoners, 17 pieces of cannon, 3,000 small arms, 46,000 rounds of ammunition and 563 animals. :. - I, i Gen. G ran then assumed immediate command of the Army of the-Mississippi, which was largely reinforced. Uraut soon became satisfied that the north line cf Vicksburg was too strong to be suc cessfully attacked; tbe canal soon proved a fail ure; ami General Grant directed his attention to other means of turning the enemy's flank. With the assistance of. Porter and Farragut be ran the batteries at Vicksburg, and his army crossed the river seventy miles below, and began ihe im portant snovement upon the rear of Vicksburg which is described iu detail. ' . The movement was followed by the battles of Raymond, May 12; of Jackson. Ma v 14; of Champion' Hil.. May 13; and Big Black River Bridge, May 17in all of which our troops were victorious. ' - In this campaign Gen Grant captured 37,000 prisoners, ilis total loss in the whole movement was 1 ,243 killed, 7,095 wounded and 537 missing. Gen Halleck temarks: "No more brilliant exploit can be found in mil itary history. . It has been alleged, and the alle gation has been widely circulated by the press. that Gen. urant, in the conduct ot his campaign, positively disobeyed the instructions ol his supe riors It is hhrdl v necessary to remark that Gen. Grant never disobeyed an order or instruction. but always carried out to the best of his ability every wish or suggestion made to him by the .government. Moreover, he has never complain ed that the government did not furnish him all the means and assistance In its power to facilitate the execution of any plan he saw fit to adopt Then followed a period of rest to the greater portion of the army; Gen. Sherman s corps, how ever, captured Jackson on. tbe iGih ot Julv, when Gen. Sherman returned to Vicksburg to recuperate. Operations iu tbe Department or Missouri are not reviewed at much length, all the battles and skirmishes being recounted, but no new facts are presented. In Arkansas Gen. Steele drove the enemv south of tbe Arkansas river, and finally bevond the Red river. A large portion of the inilitarv of this department has been engaged iu suppressing the raids of guerrillas, and Gen Halleck urges severe measures against these out- laws. Gen. Pope's operations against the Indians in the √Ñortlmest have been quite successful. Nearly all the hostile tribes have been scattered aud driven beyond the Missouri into British ter ritory. i he Department of the Pacific has been ex empt from civil war. The only fightine has been wita a tew hostile tribes of Indians. Neither had anything else been done in New Mexico during the vear. The Department of the Ohio comrriKPa th opera tionS'of Gen. Burns'de and his predecessors, and recounts the several raids iu East Tennessee by Gens. "7arter, Spe-ir and Sanders, ihe capture of John Morgan and bis command, ana finally the important operations in .bast 1 ennesse up to the commencement of tbe siee of Knoxville These facts are only a repetition of the history of that portion of the war which is vet l're-h in the minds of the public. Geu. Burnside was or dered to co-operate with Gen. Rosecrans after his occupatiou of Knoxville aud Loudon. General Burnside was ordered to move down by the north bank of the river. "But akliouzh repeatedly urged o effect this junction with the Army of the Cumberland, Gen. Burnside retained most of his forces in the upper valley, which was stiil threat ened oy a small rebel force under Sam. Jones The report does not come down to the siege of Knoxville. r, Geu. Rosecrans operations are succinctly re viewed from the time of his taking command up to his removal, including the battle of Stone River at length. In that battle, we lost 1,533 killed. 7,245 wounded, and 2,800 missing, and 28 pieces of artillery. We took hi nieces of artil lery. Upon subsequent operations, Gen. Halleck remarks: "While General Grant was operating before Vicksburg, information deemed reliable was re ceived from captured rebel correspondence that large detachments were being drawn from Gen. Bragg's army to reinforce Johnson iu Mississippi Reinforcements were sent to Grant from other armies iu the West, but Gen. Rosecrans' armv was left iu Uct in order that he might t ike ad vantage of Bragg's diminished numbers, and drive him back into Georgia, and thus secure loval East Tennessee from the hands of the re bels, an object which the Government has kept constantly hi view Irom the beginning of the war, I therefore urged Gen. Kosecrans to take advan tage of this opportunity to carry nut his long projected movement, informing him that Gen Burnside would co operate with his force, moving from Kentucky to E ist Tcnnes.-ee. For various reasons he preferred to poMpone his movement until the termination ot the siege of Vicksburg ' Gen. H illeck thre the responsibility of mov ing or no; moving upon Gen. Rosecrans Iu correspondence that toilowed, Rosecrans finally advanced against Bragg, who retreated, but the former's movements were r.ipid and verv suixe-t' ful, the enemy being forced out of bis trongly positions one alter tne otner. Gen. Halleck then goes into a (ull history of Gen. Rosecrans operations in Alab-ima, 1 euues see and Georgia, which culminated In his defeat at Chicks mauga. AH the corrrsponilence on the subject is given. The movement appears to have been conceive I by Gen. Ro-ecrans and sanctioned by Gen. H illeck. Gen. Burnside was certainly ordered to reinforce Gen. Rosecrans, us late as September 14, ntid Geo Hurlbut, at Memphis w.is put under like orders. This part 'of Gen Ualleck's report endeavors to show, at length the efforts ra ide for the rein force tn en t of Gen Rosecrans before the battle of CiiickamniL'a Generals Grant, Pope and Schofigld wet e called on jor their spare troops, but Grant', -a ho hat them to spare, was in New Orleans, and could not be reached. Oen. Hallack says it w pro posed to put Gen. Grant in chief command of the three armies as early as the middle of September but his absence and illness at New Orients ore- vented it. l hen came the battle ol Gbickamauga, con cerning which Halleck avs it was very difficult to ascertain from which direction Bragg bad been reinforced. Our loss in that battle was 16,000 in killed, wounded, and missing, and 36 pieces of artillerv. We captured 2,o'HJ prisoners. The report of military operations come down to the capture of Lookout Valley by Hooker's movement from Bridgeport, on tbe itoih ol October, the credit of which is ascribed to Gen Grant. The balance of the report is confined to gen eral remarks and recommendations, one of which is to establish the grades of General and Lieuten ant General in the armv. with the same pay and emoluments ns Major Generals. Servian do Wood' Proposition. The Louisville Democrat makes the following comments upon Fmxasdo Wood's peace propo sition: . , i . . - t We see that Fernando Wood has made a move to see if peace commissioner's can't do something for a restoration. It is ominous that the proposition-was laid ou the table by a rn-ijoritv of eiijht. A chiugeof five votes would hsve car ried it. In peace prepare I or war. Is a good maxim. In war prepare for peace, is equally good. It may be charged that this will encourage the rebels. If it does; it will be their own fault. All sober people who lock on this contest will re gard this movement as praiseworthy. It places the Government in a favorable light before the world and before its own people. Sooner or la ter such a proposition will carry, and it will end in a Union of the States. Magnanimity and concession will enlist the sympathies of the world, and will find a respouse in the hearts of the mass es who feel no interest except in the restoration of the Union. ... Perhaps the time has not come yet for wisdom and moderation, but the time will come. Trie Governor of Indiana Threaten tle People. Oliver P. Morton, Governor of Indiana, is not ft person of extraordin√§r delicacy. If he were, the intimate relations in 1 which he notoriously stands with thore who are-known to turn their patriotism to very profitable account through his assistance, would impress him with a sense of the. propriety of making as little parade as possible of his loyalty and ' public devotion. We do not' know that .Tadas Iscariot, while lie was "a thief and carried the bag," did not bold forth with great unction and effect upon the vital points of practical Christianity; but, admitting that he did , so, we should, looking back, hardly see the fact in- any other light than as affording additional proof of his .moral rotteness and disgusting by-. pocracy. ' -- Of the men in public life in the West there s not one who, to the ootside observer, has, more than Governor Morton, borne the appearance, of- I having, during the unhappy disturbances jn which . the country is plunged, kept, steadily in view the ,. powers and profits which might, by the force of circumstances, re turned to bis own account. Covetous, at once, of wealth and authority, and with just enough of political sagacity to know how to keep himself upon tbe summitof the wave of popular fanaticism, be has exhibited a disre gard for consistency and a recklessness of conse-, quences which onlv need a field wide enough for their full display to enable him to become-as cruel and monstrous in fact as he is i a propensity. - t is well we were about to sty for the world that this despotism of spirit is not, in the case of Governor Morton, accompanied by high personal courage; but, in fact, for the safety of mankind, tbe two are not often associated. The despot is almost necessarily a coward. The same ingredi ents that enter into the domineering tyrant make up the sneaking demagogue, and scarcely more than a change in the surroundings is requisite to transform the one into the other., .-' Oue of the ends which,, since these troubles ' began, Gov. Morton has been most desirous to promote, is a civil war in Indiana.', We state this positively, because,' in nearly every public exhi bition which t v. Juorton has made of himself, thisdtsire has appeared with a districtness which renders it unmistakable. He would prefer, of course, so to arrange the preliminaries, as to give to the party which opposed bis accession to pow er the appearance of having begun the work of violence; and he has labored, with some skill and much assiduity, to impose upon them the necessity to take the initiative; but rather than not have the conflict take place, he would him- - self almost assume the responsibility to order tts- inauguration. Nothing, we are convinced, but the fear of those personal consequences which such an act might entail, has prevented him from plunging, before this, the people of his State into the horrors of mutual and indiscriminate murder; and that he is now only waiting until some turn of events shall afford an opening to begin, is a fact which he takes no pains to conceal. V e have before us the report of a speech made by Governor Morton, at a recent great war meet ing holden at Indianapolis. In this speech he does not hesitate to tell the people who are op ptmed to the war, whit will be their fate and the fate of their families when, other matters being disposed of, time shall be afforded to attend to them: "His Excellency warned those whom he sup posed were opposing this war here in the North, to flee Irom the wrath to com. All such, at tbe conclusion of the war, would be outlawed, their liomcs desolate, their wives and children out casts." ' 4t Tak'ttg into consideration the fact that the ut- terer of this language is Governor of the State, and that his constitutional duty, as such, is to do all in his power to protect the people, not only fiom violence, but from lears of violence.it must be admitted that our language supplies no terms to characterize such conduct as it deserves. The ordinary tiomencalture by which crime and in famy is described, has no applicability. W e want, for such a purpose, a terminology which nhflll bear the same relation to that in common use us the most corrosive acids do to the gentlest emollients. It is true the creature is only a demagogue; bu the is a demagogue w'th murder on his tongue, and malice in his hert -compar ing with other demazocues as an obscene and ferocious baboon compares with the milder and more placable members of tbe brute creation. It is sod when such creatures are enabled to creep to power under such ciicn instances as permit them to give loose rein to their untamed passions and inhuman propensities. Cin. Enq. rtie President' Plan to Prevent tbe ' Iteatoratlon of the Cnion. fFrom the Boston Courier. The President's message occupies so much of onr snace that we have little left for comments npon it. 1 hat portion of it to which the eves or all men will naturally turn first, is the promised plan of the President for the pacification of the country, which, now we have it, must "ertainly be reckoned eirrcinous. V hatever doubts may have been heretofore entertained, if any, as to the extent of the radical influences operating npon his mind, the plan proposed by him neces sarily removes them all. Hesitating, as usual, and avowing that he offers his mode of settling a great civil conflict, only as in conformity with his "present impression;" and distinctly declar ing that "it must not bo understood that no other mode would bo acceptable" to him, ho nevertheless re-affirms Us emancipation proc lamation, announces that he shall not "attempt to modify or retract it," and accordingly decrees the acceptance of the emancipation project by the people of the slave States to be the inexorable condition of their restoration to the Union that is, according to "his present impressions." To argue this question seems to us merely childish. , Whether our military fortunes in the future prove more or less brilliant than they have been in the past, it is clearlv not likely that en forced emancipation, mneh less voluntary, will take effcctaluring Mr. Lincoln's term. Accord ing to his statement, a hundred thousand, of tho nearlv four millions of slaves in the South. haTC been liberated bv tho advance of onr armies, with in the period of almost three vears that the war has actually ragod. To the most ordinary ap prehension, one would think it might seem plain that his mode ot pacmcation, though, it might m time convert tho entire South into the wilder ness which it has o largely become, nnder the ravasres of war, and might reduce its people to a condition of comparative babarism; vet, after generations of civil conflict, iu comparison with the horrors and ruin of which all the negroes that ever existed on the fitw of the earth are bnt as the small dnt of the balance, the Lrocs in those States will still be slaves. ' The President citrx but two Sta'es, Missouri and Maryland, in which he ventures to assume that the envtticipniiot) Iheory has made any t ensi ble progress.' ltr the fir?.t, the fjpporters of the President's radic-tl policy have jtist been decis . airely overcome in a political struagle; notwith standing the fact that the State is the most fivor able field of all f tryinc his experiment, and has beeu perhaps of all others, the most mercilessly subject to forcible processes for carrying that theory cut. : Iu Maryland, the election on which he chooses to rely was a notoiious mixture of KTce and fraud, so grossly misrepresenting the' opinions, of the majority, thnt we beliere there is , not ! i 'county in the State. In which a decided majority of the inhabitants would not infitiitelv prefer to tike . their chances with the Confederates, at thU moment, than submit to the President's pacifying policy. It Is Idle to cherish the idea that th?re is any nen timcnt of the slightest practical consequence fa-' vorable to it, or which can bo made favorable to it, in any other slave State. The Presidcst's mode, therefore, and the Proclamation of (so called j Amnesty, in conformity with it, is a block to pacification, instead of an aid to it; and so long as it is persisted in dooms the nation to in definitely continued war. The gage is thus squarely thrown down; and tbe people of the country are to take it solemnly to heart, whether they will devote their country to unparalleled ruin, or by taking affairs into their own hands, in tie legitimate way, w√ºl institute a different polier, by which alone there would be some rea- -son for hope that the follies and madness of tbe past might be in time partially repaired. ' Order Hrlftit in Delawre, ' The leading paper in Delaware, the Delawar ian, spe iking of tbe military interference in the election for member of Congress in that State, "The work is now completed the work begun a year ago.
