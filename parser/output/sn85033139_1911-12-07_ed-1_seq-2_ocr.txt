THINKS AMENDMENTS NEEDED Believes Present Statutes Good as Far at They Go but Suggests Supple mental Legislation—For Fed eral Corporation Law. Washington. Dec. s—President Taft's annual message, which was read in both houses of congress today, deals exclusively with the anti trust statute. The full text of the message is as fol lows; To the Senate and House of Repre sentailves: This message is the first of several which 1 shall send to con gress during the interval between the opening of Its regular session and Us adjournment for the Christmas holi days. The amount of Information lo be communicated as to the operations of the government, the number of impor tant subjects calling for comment by the executive, and the transmission to congress of exhaustive reports by spe cial commissions, make it. Impossible to include In one message of a reason able length a discussion of the topics that ought to be brought to the alien lion of the national legislature at Us first regular session. The Anti-Trust Law—The Supreme Court Decisions. In May last the Supreme court hand ed down decisions in the suits in equity brought by the United States to enjoin the further maintenance of the Standard Oil trust and of (he Ameri can Tobacco trust, and to secure their dissolution. Tile decisions are epoch making and serve to advise the bush nsss world authoritatively of the scope and operation of the anil-trust act ol 1890. The decisions do not depart in any substantial way from the previous decisions of the court In construing and applying this important statute, but they clarify those important deci sions by further defining the already admitted exception! to the literal con struction of the act. By the decrees, they furnish a useful precedent as to (he proper method of dealing with the capital and property of illegal trusts. These decisions suggest the need and wisdom of additional or supplemental legislation to make It easier lor the entire business community to square with the rule of action and legality thus finally established and lo preserve the benefit, freedom apd spur of rea sonable competition wllhout loss of real efficiency or progress. No Change In the Rule of Decision Merely in Its Form of Expression. The statute In Its first section de clares to be illegal "every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, In restraint of trade or commerce among the sev eral states or with foreign nations," and in the second, declares guilty of a misdemeanor every person who shall monopolize or attempt to monopolize or combine o conspire with any other person to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce of (lie several states or with icrelgn nations." In two early cases, where the statute was Invoked to enjoin a transportation agreement between Interstate railroad companies, it was held that It was no defense lo show that the agreement as to rates complained of was reasonal at common law, because It was said that the statute was directed against all contracts and combinations in re atraint of trade whether reasonal at common law or not It was plain from lb-- record, however, that the contracts complained of in those cases would not have been deemed reasonable tit common law. In subsequent cases the court said that the statute should lie given a reasonal construction and re -11/ ed 'o include within its inhibition cerla'r contractual restraints of trade whic t it dominated as Incidental or as Indirect. Them; cases of restraint of trade Hint the court excepted from the operation ' of the statute were Instances which, at i common law - , would have been called reasonable In the Standard OH and Tobacco cases, therefore, the court merely adopted the |enta of the com mon law, and In defining exceptions to the literal application of the statute, only substituted for the test of being Incidental or Indirect, that of being reaaonable and this, without varying In the slightest the actual scope and effect of the statute In other words, all the cases under the statute which have now been decided would have been decided the same way It the court had originally accepted lu Its construe tlon the rule at common law. It has been said that the court, by Introducing into the construction (/ Bargains. "Once I could have bought (he site if Chicago for S4OO lu Mexican money." "1 know bow It la, old chap. 1 had i chance to buy a beefsteak once for 11 cents a pound." Premature, Stage Hero (In backwoods town) At last, fair Gwendolyn, we are alone Lone Member of Audience Not yet. Call It oft till the end of this act l m going then the statute common law distinctions, has emasculated It. This Is obviously untrue. By Its judgment every con tract and combination in restraint of interstate (rude made with the purpose or necessary effect of controlling prices by stifling competition, or of establish ing in whole or In part a monopoly of such trade, is condemned hy the stat ute. The most extreme critics cannot Instance a case that ought to be con demned under the statute which is not brought within Its terms as thus con strued. The suggestion Is also made that the Supreme court by its decision in the last two cases has committed to the court the undefined and unlimited dis cretion to determine whether a case of restraint of trade Is within the terms of the statute. This is wholly untrue. A reasonable restraint of trade at common law is well under stood and is clearly define'’. It does not rest in the discretion o i the court. It must be limited to accomplish the purpose of a lawful main contract to which, In order that it shall he en forceable at all, it must be incidental. If if exceeds the needs of that contract It is void. The test of reasonableness was never applied by the court at com mon-law to contracts or combinations or conspiracies In restraint of trade whose purpose was or whose neces sary effect would be to stifle competi tion, to control prices, or establish monopolies. The courts never as sumed power to say that such con tracts or combinations or conspira cies might bo lawful if the parties to Ihom were only moderate in the use of the power thus secured and did not exact from the public too great and exorbitant prices. It Is true that many theorists, and others en gaged in business violating the statue, have hoped that some such line could be drawn by courts; but no court pf authority has ever at tempted IL Certainly there Is noth ing in the decisions of the latest, two cases which should be a dangerous theory of judicial discretion in en forcing this statue can derive the slightest sanction. Fore# and Effectiveness of Statute a Matter of Growth. \V have been twenty-one years making this statue effective for the purposes for which it was enacted. Tile Knight case was discouraging and seemed to remit to the states the whole available power to attack and suppress the evils of the trusts. Slowly, however, the errors of that judgment was corrected, and only in Ihr last three or four years has the heavy hand of the law been laid upon the great illegal combinations that have exercised such an absolute do minion over many of our industries Criminal prosecutions have been brought and a number are pending, but juries have felt averse to convict ing for jail sentences, and judges have been most reluctant to Impose such sen tences on men of respectable standing in society whose offense has been regarded as merely statutory. Still, as the offense becomes bettor under stood and the committing of It par takes more of studied and deliberate 1 defiance of the law, we can be confi dent that Juries will convict Individ uals and that Jail sentences will be Imposed. The Remedy In Equity by Dissolution. In the Standard OH case the Su preme and circuit courts found the combination to he a monopoly of the interstate business of refining, trans porting, and marketing petroleum and Its products, effected and maintained through thirty-seven different cor porations, Ihe stock of which was held bv a New .Jersey company. It in effect commanded the dissolution of this combination, directed the transfer and pro-rata distribution by the New Jersey company of the stock held by It in the thirty seven corporations to and among its stock holders. and the corporations and in dividual defendants were enjoined from conspiring or combining (o re store uuoh monopoly; and all agree ments i tween the subsidiary corpor ations lending to produce or bring about further violations of (ho act were enjoined. In (lie Tobacco case, the court found that the Individual defendants, twenty-nine In number, had been en gaged In a successful effort to ac quire complete dominion over the manufacture, sale, and distribution of tobacco in this country and abroad, and that this had been done by com binations made with a purpose and effect to stlfio competition, control prices and establish a monopoly, not only in (lie manufacture of tobneco, but also of tin-foil and licorice used In Us manufacture and of Us products of cigars, cigarettes, and snuffs The tobacco suit presented a far more complicated and difficult case than (lie Standard Oil suit for a decree which would effectuate Iho will of the court and end the violation of the statute There was here no single holding company ns In the case of the Standard Oil trust. The main company was the American Tobacco company, a manufacturing, selling, and holding company. The plan adopted to destroy the combination and restore competition Involved the redivlslon of the capital and plants of the whole trust between some of the companies constituting (he trust and now companies organized for the purposes of the decree and made partied to It and numbering, new and old, fourteen. Situation After Readjustment. The American Tobacco company (old) rndjusted capital, {92,000,000; the I.lggetl and Meyers Tobacco com pany (new) capital, $87,000,000; the I’ Ixrrlllnrd company (new) capital, $-17,000,000, and the It .1 Reynolds Tobacco company (old) capital. |7,- C 25.000, are chiefly engaged In the Unlikely to Pass. "Can’t you settle ibis bill today, Blr’" asked the tailor of the delinquent senator. "No, Sh'ars; It wouldn't be parlia mentary.

A monkey may also pay for cham pagne olunar. manufacture and aale of chewing and smoking tobacco ami cigars. The former one tin-foil company Is di vided Into two, one of $825,000 cap ital and the other of $400,000. The one muff company Is divided Into three companies, one with a capital of 115,000,000; another with a cap ital of $8,000,000, and a third with a capital of $8,000,000. The licorice companies are two. one with a cap ital of $5,758,00 and another with a capital of $2,000,000. There Is, also, the Brltlsh-Amerlcan Tobacco com pany, a British corporation, doing business abroad with a capital of $26,000,000, the Porto Rican Tobac co company with a capital of $1,800,000, and the corporation of United Cigar Stores, with a capital of $9,000,000. Under this arrange ment each of the different kinds of business will be distributed between two or more companies, with a di vision of the prominent brands In the same tobacco products, so us to make competition not only possible but necessary. Thus the smoking tobac co business cf the country is divided so that the present Independent com panies have 21.39 per cent., while the American Tobacco company will have 33.08 per cent., the Liggett and Meyers 20.05 per rent., the Lorlllard company 22.82 per cent., and the Reynolds company 2.66 per cent. The stock of the other thirteen companies, both preferred and common, has been taken from the defendant American Tobacco company and has been dis tributed among its stockholders. All covenants restricting competition have been declared null and further per formance of them has been enjoined. The preferred stock of the different companies has now been given vot ing power which was denied it under the old organization. The ratio of the preferred stock to the common was pm 78 to 40. This constitutes a very decided change in the character of (lie ownership and control of each company. In the original suit ‘here were twen ty-nine defendanls who were charged with being the conspirators through w hom tile illegal combination acquired and exercised Its unlawful dominion. Under the decree these defendants will hold amounts of stock In the va rious distributee companies ranging from 41 per cent, as a maximum to 2SVi Per cent as a minimum, except in the case of one small company, the Porto Rican Tobacco company, In w'hlch they will hold 46 per cent. The twenty-nine individual defendants are enjoined for three years from buying any stock except from each other, and the group Is thus prevented from extending its control during that pe riod. All parties to the suit, and the new companies who are made parties, are enjoined perpetually from in any way effecting any combination be tween any of the companies in viola tion of the statute by way of resump tion of the old trust. Kach of the fourteen companies Is enjoined from acquiring stock In any of the others. AH these companies are enjoined from having common directors or officers, nr common buying or selling agents, or common offices, or lending money to eacli other. Size of New Companies. Objection was made by certain In dependent tobacco companies that this settlement was unjust because it left companies with very large capital in active business, and that the settle ment that would he effective to put all on an equality would lie a division of (ho capital and plant of the trust into small factions In amount more nearly equal to that of each of the Independ ent. companies. This contention re sults from a misunderstanding of the antitrust law and Its purpose. It is not Intended thereby lo prevent the accumulation of large capital in busi ness enterprises in which such a com bination can secure reduced cost of production, sale and distribution. It Is directed against such an aggrega tlon of capital only when Us purpose is that of stifling competition, enhanc ing or controlling prices and estab lishing a monopoly. If wo shall have by Hie decree defeated these purposes and restored competition between the large units into which the capital and plant have been divided, we shall have accomplished the useful purpose of the statute. Confiscation Not the Purpose of the Statute. It la not the purpose of (he statute j to confiscate the property and capital of the offending trusts Methods of punishment by line or Imprisonment of the individual offenders, hy fine of the corporation, or by forfeiture of Its goods in transportation, are provided, hut the proceeding In equity la a spe cific remedy to stop the operation of the trust by Injunction and prevent the future use of the plant and capital In violation of the statute. Effectiveness of Decree. I venture to say that not In the his tory of American law has a decree more effective for such a purpose been entered hy a court than that } ~galqst the Tobacco trust As Circuit i Judge Noyes said in his Judgment ap | proving the decree; “The extent to which l‘ has been I necessary to tear apart this combina tion and force It Into new forms with | ,he attendant burdens ought to dem | onstrate that the federal anil-trust j statute 1s a drastic statute which ac | cOtnpJlsnes effective results; which so I long ns It stands on the statute books | must he obeyed, and which cannot Ibe disobeyed without Incurring far i reaching penalties. And, on the oth [ it hand, the successful reconstruction | uf this organization should teach that the effect of enforcing this statute Is ! not to destroy, but to reconstruct; not | to demolish but to re create In ac -1 cord a nee with the conditions which I the congress has declared shall exist Where We Are Strong.

Common-Stock Ownership. It has been assumed that the pres ent pro-rata and common ownership In all these companies by former stockholders of the trust would Insure a continuance of the same old single control of all the companies Into ' which the trust has by ddcree been disintegrated. This Is erroneous and Is based upon the assumed Inefflcacy and Innocuousness of judicial Injunc tions. The companies are enjoined from cn-operatlon or combination; they have different managers, direc tors purchasing and sales agents. If all or any of the numerous stockhold ers, reaching Into the thousands, at tempt to secure concerted action of the companies with a view to the con trol of the market, their number Is so large that such an attempt could not well be concealed and Its prime mov ers and all Its participants would be at once subject to contempt proceed ings and Imprisonment of a summary character. The Immediate result of the present situation will necessarily be activity by all the companies un der different managers, and then com petition must follow, or there will be activity by one company and stag nation by another. Only a short time will inevitably lead to a change in ownership of the stock, as all oppor tunity for continued co operation must disappear. Those critics who speak of this disintegration In the trust as a mere change of garments have not given consideration to the inevitable working of the decree and understand little the personal danger of attempt ing to evade or set at naught the sol emn Injunction of a court whose ob ject Is made plain by the decree and whose inhibitions are set forth with a detail and comprehensiveness unex ampled in the history of equity juris prudence. The effect of these two decisions has led to decrees dissolving the combina tion of manufacturers of electric lamps, a soi fhern wholesale grocers’ associa tion. an Interlocutory decree against the lewder trust with directions by the circuit court compelling dissolu tion, and other combinations of a sim ilar history are now negotiating with the department of justice looking to a disintegration by decree and reorgan ization In accordance with law. It seems possible to bring about these re organizations without general business disturbance. Movement for Repeal of the Anti-Trust Law. But now that the antitrust act Is seen to be effective for the accomplish ment of the purpose of its enactment, wo are met by a cry from many differ ent quarters for Its repeal. It Is said to bo obstructive of business progress, to be an attempt to restore old fash ioned methods of destructive compel! lion between small units, and to make Imjiosslble those useful combinations of capital and the reduction of the cost of production that are essential to con tinned prosperity ami normal growth. In the recent decisions the Supreme court makes clear that there is noth ing In the statute which condemns combinations of capital or mere big ness of plant organized to secure economy in production and a reduc tion of Us cost. It 's only when the purpose or necessary effect of the or ganization and maintenance of the combination or the aggregation of Im mense size are the stifling of competi tion. actual and potential, and the en hancing of prices and establishing a monopoly, that the statute Is violated. Mere size is no sin against the law. The merging of two or more business plants necessarily eliminates competl tlon between the units thus combined, hut this elimination Is in contravention of the statute only when the combina tion Is made for purpose of ending this particular competition In order to se cure control of, and enhance, prices and create a monopoly. Lack of Definiteness in the Statute. The complaint Is made of the statute that it Is not sufficiently definite In Its description of that which is forbid den, to enable business men to avoid Its violation. The suggestion Is, that we may have a combination of two corporations, which may run on for years, and that subsequently the attor ney general may conclude that it was a vioh tlon of the statute, and that which *.is supposed by the combiners to be Innocent then turns out to be a combination In violation of the stat ute. The answer to this hypothetical case Is that when men attempt to amass stupendous capital as will en able them to suppress competition, control prices and establish a monop oly they know the purpose of 'their acts. Men do not do such a thing without having It ideally In mind. If what they do Is merely fot the purpose of reducing the cost of production, without the thought of suppressing competition by use of the bigness of the plant they are creating, then they cannot be convicted at the time the | union Is made, nor can they be con -1 vlcted later, unless It happen that later on (hoy conclude to suppress competl I Hon and take the usual methods for doing so. and thus establish for them selves a monopoly. They can. In such a case, hardly complain If the motive which subsequently Is disclosed is at tributed by the court to the original combination. New Remedies Suggested. Much Is said of the repeal of this statute and of constructive legislation Intended to accomplish the purpose and blaze a clear path for honest mer chants and business men to follow. It may he that such a plan will be evolved, hut I submit that the discus skins which have been brought out in I recent days by the fear of the con tinued execution of the anti-tryst law have produced nothing but glittering generalities ami have offered no Hue of distinction or rule of action as A Neat Device.

Supplemental Legislation Needed —Not Repeal or Amendment. I see no objection—and Indeed 1 can see decided advantages—ln the enact mentofalaw which shall describe eud denor.ee methods of competition, which are unfair and are badges of the unlawful purpose denounced in the anti-trust law. The attempt and pur pose to suppress a competitor by un derselling him at a price so unprofit able as to drive him out of business, or the making of exclusive contracts with customers under which they are required to give up association with other manufacturers, and numerous kindred methods for stifling competi tion and effecting monopoly, should be described with sufficient accuracy In a criminal statute on the one hand to enable the government to shorten Its task by prosecuting single misde meanors instead of an entire con spiracy, and, on the other hand, to serve the purpose of pointing out more In detail to the business com munity what must be avoided. Federal Incorporation Recommended. In a special message to congress on January 7, 1910, I ventured to point out the disturbance to buslneas that would probably attend the disso lution of these offending trusts I said: "Hut such an Investigation and pos sible prosecution of corporations whose prosperity or destruction affects the comfort not only of stockholders but of millions of wage earners, em ployes, and associated tradesmen must necessarily tend to disturb the con fidence of the business community, to dry up the now flowing sources of capital from Its places of hoarding, and produce a halt In our present prosperity that will cause suffering and strained circumstances among the Innocence many for the faults of the guilty few. The question which I wish in this message to bring clear ly to the consideration and discus sion of congress is whether. In order to avoid such a possible business danger, something cannot be done by which these business combinations may be offered a means, without great financial disturbance, of changing the character, organization, and extent of their business into one within the lines of the law under federal control and supervision, securing compliance with the anti-trust statute. “(Jenerally, In the Industrial com binations called ’Trusts,’ the prin cipal business Is the sale of goods In many states and In foreign markets; In other words, the Interstate and for eign business far exceeds the busi ness done In any one state. This fact will justify the federal govern ment In granting a federal charter to such a combination to make and sell In interstate and foreign com merce the products of useful manu facture under such limitations as will serure a compliance with the anti trust law. It Is possible so to frame a statute that while it offers protec tion to a federal company against harmful, vexatious, and unnecessary invasion by the states, It shall sub ject it to reasonable taxation and control by tbe states with respect to its purely local business. “Corporations organized under this act should be prohibited t orn ac quiring and holding stock In other corporation (except for special rea sons, upon approval by the proper federal authority), thus avoiding the creation under national auspices of the holding company with subordinate corporations In different states, which has been s.ich an effective agency In the creatlor of the great trusts and monopolies. “If the prohibition of the anti-trust act against combinations in restraint of trade Is to bo effectively enforced, It Is essential that the national gov ernment shall provide for the creation of national corporations to carry on a legitimate business throughout the United States. The conflicting laws of the different states of the Union with respect to foreign corporations makes it difficult, if not impossible, for one corporation to comply with their re quirements so as to carry on business In a number of different states." 1 renew the recommendation of the enactment of a general law providing for the voluntary formation of cor porations to engage in trade and com merce among the states and with for eign nations. Every argument which was then advanced for such a law. and every explanation which was at that time offered to possible objec tions, have been confirmed by our ex perience since the enforcement of the anti-trust statute has resulted in the actual dissolution of active com mercial organizations. It 1s even more manifest now than It was then that the denunciation of conspiracies In restraint of trade should not and does not mean the de nial of organizations large enough to bo Intrusted with our Interstate and foreign trade. It has been made more clear now than It was then that a purely negative statute like the anti trust law may well be supplemented by specific provisions for the build ing up and regulation of legitimate national and foreign commerce. Government Administrative Experts Needed to Aid Courts In Trust Dissolutions. The drafting of the decrees In the dissolution of the present trusts, with a view to their reorganization Into legitimate corporations, has made It especially apparent that the courts are not provided with the administra tive machinery to make the neces sary Inquiries prepatatory to re organization. or to pursue such In quiries, ana they should be empow ered to Invoke the aid of the bureau of corporations In determining the suitable reorganization of the dlsln- Apologetic.

The circuit court and the attorney general were great ly aided In framing the decree In the tobacco trust dissolution by an ex pert from the bureau of corporations. Federal Corporation Commlsalon Pro posed. I do not set forth In detail the terms and sections of a statute which might supply the constructive legislation per mitting and aiding the formation of combinations of capital Into federal corporations. They should be subject to rigid rules as to their organization and procedure, Including effective pub licity, and to the closest supervision as to the Issue of stock and bonds by an executive bureau or commission In the department of commerce and labor, to which In times of doubt they might well submit their proposed plans for future business. It must be distinctly understbod that Incorporation under a federal law could not exempt the com pany thus formed and Its Incorporators and managers from prosecution under the anti-trust law for subsequent Ille gal conduct, but the publicity of Its procedure and the opportunity for fre quent consultation with the bureau or commission In charge of the Incorpora tion as to the legitimate purpose of Its transactions would offer it as great se curity against successful prosecutions for violations of the law as would be practical or wise. Such a bureau or commission might well be Invested also with tue duty al ready referred to, of aiding courts In the dissolution and recreation of trusts within the law. It should be an execu tive tribunal of the dignity and power of the comptroller of the currency or the interstate commerce commission, which now exercise supervisory power over Important classes of corporations under federal regulation. The drafting of such a federal incor poration law w mid offer ample oppor tunity to prevent many manifest evils in corporate management today, in cluding irresponsibility of control in the hands of the few who arc not the real owners. Incorporation Voluntary. I recommend that the federal char ters thus to be granted shall be volun tary, at least until experience justifies mandatory provisions. The benefit to be derived from the operation of great businesses under the protection of such a charter would attract all wbo are anxious to keep within the lines of the law. Other large combinations that fail to take advantage of the fed eral Incorporation will not have a right to complain if their failure Is ascribed to unwillingness to submit their transactions to the careful scru tiny, competent supervision and pub licity attendant upon the enjoyment of such a charter. Supplemental Legislation Needed. The opportunity thus suggested for federal incorporation, it seems to me. is suitable constructive legislation needed to facilitate the squaring of great industrial enterprises to the rule of a :t!on laid down by the anti-trust law. This statute Is construed by the Supreme court must continue to be tb? line of distinction for legiti mate business. It must be enforced, unless we are to banish individualism from all business and reduce It to one common system of regulation or con trol of prices like that which now pre vails with respect to public utilities, and which when applied to all busi ness would be a long step toward state socialism. Importance of, the Anti-Trust Act. The anti-trust act is the expression of the effort of a freedom-loving peo ple to preserve equality of opportun ity, It is the insult of the confident determination of such a people to maintain their future growth by pre serving uncontrolled and unrestricted the enterprise of the individual, hla Ingenuity, his intelligence and his In dependent courage. For twenty years or more this stat ute has been upon the statute book All knew of Its general purpose and approved. Many of its violators wore cynical over Us assumed impotence. It seemed Impossible of enforce ment. Slowly the mills of the courts ground, and only gradually did the ma jesty of the law assert Itself. Many of Its statesmen-authors died before It became a living force, nd they and others saw the evil grow which they had hoped to destroy Now, its effi cacy 1s seen; now its power is heavy; now Its object is near achievement. Now we hear the call for Its repeal on the plea that It interferes with busi ness prosperity, and we are advised In most general terms how, by some other statute and In some other way, the evil wj are just stamping out can be cured, If we only abandon this work of twenty years and try another ex periment lor another term of years. It Is said that the act has not done good. Can this be said In the face of the effect of the Northern Securities decree? That decree was in no way so dras tic or Inhlbltlve In detail as either the Standard Oil decree or the tobacco de cree: but did It not stop for all time the then powerful movement toward the control of all the railroads of the country In a single hand? Such a one-man power could not have been a healthful Instance In the republic, even though exercised under the general supervision of an Inter state commission. Do we desire to make such ruthless combinations and monopolies lawful? When all energies are directed, not toward the reduction of the cost of production for the public benefit by a healthful competition, but toward new ways and means for making perma nent In a few hands the absolute con trol of the conditions and prices pre vailing In the whole field of Industry, then Individual enterprise and effort will be paralyzed apd the spirit ot commercial freedom will be dead.

TAFT CRITICIZES HIS OWN RECORD Reviews Acts of Administration as Chief Executive. WOULD MODIFY WINONA TALK Still Believes, However, That Payne- Aldrich Tariff Law Did Revise Downward and Defends Wool Veto. New York. —Inan Interview given at Hot Springs, Va., recently and which was In the Outlook, President Taft gives his views of the achievements and failure of bis administration to date. In defending his vetoes at the last session the president characterizes the legislation sent him as so crude and 111-digested that its authors must have known he could not approve It. The president’s chief objection to a needlessly high tariff is that it nour ishes monopoly. He defends the make up of his tariff board, which be says is doing a most useful work, elaborates upomthe admittedly good points in the existing tariff, argues for an income tax. stoutly defends his Judicial ap pointments, and take the public Into .his confidence regarding the "unfin ished business’* for the rest of bis term. Chief on (he list the president places reductions In the woolen and cotton schedules, and possibly in the metal schedules. These will be founded, he says, as far as his recommendations are concerned, on the report of the tariff board. Putting the whole matter up to congress, he says, he will leave the members to settle with their con stituents if they prefer not to act. Con cerning the possible attitude of the Insurgents, ho naively says; "Where they will stand I am not prophet enough even to surmise." The president urges legislation to develop Alaska, without Infringing up on the policy of conservation, and the ratification of the peace treaties with England and France and the fiscal treaties wiih Honduras and Nicaragua. Expressing the satisfaction he would experience at ft re-electlun if the peo ple decide that his first term has been fruitful enough tc warrant their enlisting hltr. for another, the presi dent makes this characteristically frank statement: "Hut I have not been willing, nor shall I be, to pur chase it at the sacrifice of my freedom to do my duty as 1 see It.
