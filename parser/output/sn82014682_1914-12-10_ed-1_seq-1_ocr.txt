D. Pringle, the second clerk who was chosen a tew days ago by Judge Stuart. It was generally reported yesterday that Manley G. K. Hopkins firmly and lepeatedly declined the position. though great pressure was brought to bear upon him by L. L. McCandless, John C. Wilson and other Democratic leaders, who held , numerous inter views with blm on the subject It was declared that Hopkins' refusal was based on his disapproval of the second clerk, already selected and engaged in court duty. Further close conference between Judge Stuart and the party leaders was held In the former's chamber this morning, with the result that the name' of Pacheco was announced be fore noon. There were man candidates for the Job, however, a number of whom were perfectly willing to have Pringle for side-partner if they could get i the priv ilege of collecting the $150 per month. Among these were Willie Miles, Mayor Fern's secretary; Harry Wilder,. Jack KalatteUvAoiT others 4oo auraerous to mention. .- Judge Stuart apparently preferred a young lady clerk If he could get one. for, bis first tentative offer was to Miss Ellen K.

Ozawa, the well-known Japanese at torney of Honolulu, who left this city December 4 in the Chiyo Maru for Yokohama, had died aboard the steam er yesterday afternoon, was vigorous ly denied this morning by the Japan ese newspapers, C. C. Bitting. Ozawa'b former law partner, and by other friends of the attorney. The rumor apparently is without foundation and inquiries by the Star-Bulletin today failed to bring to light the source ot the report According to Y, Soga of the Nlppu Jiji, his paper became aware of the rumor last night. When the Japanese Daily' Chronicle rushed an extra on to the street to the effect that Ozawa was dead aboard the Chiyo. C. C. Bit ting, when Informed of the rumor, sent two wireless messages to the Chiyo inquiring aa to the authenticity of the report, but up until the time of the Star-Bulletin golcg to press thl& afternoon had received no reply. Mr. Soga further states that a local resident sent a cablegram to Mrs. K. Imanishi, Mr. Ozawa's sister, who re sides In Tokio, to the effect that her brother was dead. Upon learning this air. soga says tnat he forwarded a cable to Mrs. Imanishi denying the report. Mr. Ozawa, who is said to be the only Japanese to practise law In the United States, bad been in poor health for severa) months prior to hi departinXfor the 'Orient This caused him to resign the position of chairman of the Japanese committee of the Mid Pacific Carnival, in which festival he took an active part last February, which action waa deeply regretted by his associates in carnival matters. Recent Executive Order Gives Enlisted Man M uch Better Chance to Brace Up A new executive order, relating to the limits of punishment for enlisted men and general prisoners of the army, went into effect December 1, and cases which are affected by it are beginning to crop up in tne Hawaiian department The new order, G. O. 70, war depart ment is one of the most Important disciplinary regulations ever made for the army, ana it is generally agreed that it is a move for better conditions and will work for the benefit of the individual. It makes the limits of punishment much more elastic, so that they can be cut to fit specific cases, and gives Increased power to the reviewing authority in the matter of mitigating sentences of courts mar tial. It gives soldiers a better chance to brace up after misbehavior, and to come through their service with a clean record. Under the new order forfeiture of pay can be changed by the court to detention of pay by adding 50 per cent to the amount. That is to 3ay, a soldier who is sentenced to forfeit $10 per month for three months might get a detention of $15 per month for three months instead, this $45 to be returned to him at the end of his enlistment Instead of confinement at hard lar bor, a soldier may be given by the court a 50 per cent increase of hard labor, without confinement In that case he" remains with his company and does military duty, but spends extra time performing the hard labor. Sentences of confinement and hard labor may be mitigated by the review ing authority as he sees fit. Another important provision is that entire sentences, except those Involv ing dishonorable discharge, may be suspended by the reviewing authority, and if the soldier remains on his good behavior for three months after the time that the sentence would have been served had it been executed the suspended sentence is annulled. There are also added rights for prisoners before courts martial. Un-

PAGES. TAX ASSESSOR ASSERTS REPORT Wilder Declares Statements as. to Non-Collection of Taxes Are Unfair Tax Assessor Charles T. Wilder f kes emphatic exception to the state ments of waste of public funds snd non-collection of taxes as summed up in a report made to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday by E. H. Paris and published in full elsewhere in the Star-Bulletin today. Assessor Wilder declares that a gross injustice has been done ttf tax office which could easily have - been avoided by on impartial investigation of all the facts. .In particular he de clares that the statement that poll-tax hooks are sent out of the tax office without a receipt being given or rec ord made of their disposition is "silly on the face of it and absolutely un true." "1 do not wish to discuss ln Field s report, on which the Pats report was based, until I have seen It" said Wil der this morning when asked for a statement "but I am willing to say that in some lmportanf respects the report of Mr. Paris does not represent the facts. I shall write to Mr. Paris and say so. I feel also that I should be allowed an opportunity to be heard by the Chamber of Commerce. Charges such as those that have been made should not be given publicity unless those who make them are absolutely aware of the facts. ' - ' "No poll-book has ever gone from our office without a receipt being given for it and when it comes back from the big business houses the employes of which 4 we are, collecting ,ibe. Uxea Tronf ' the book' Is checked over caie fully and gone over by Auditor Fisher. "In the matter of tx collections, also, the report does not fairly repre sent the matter. "The tax office is a public office open to public inspection. Mr. Field came to me to collect his data and was accorded every facility. The fig ures he gives are the figures right from my pfflce, and I am certain that these figures do not bear out the head lines this morning that thousands of dollars are lost every year through failure to collect taxes." The full report made by Chairman Paris Is published today on page 10 and the full report of Chairman Guild of the Ad Club committee will be pub lished later.
