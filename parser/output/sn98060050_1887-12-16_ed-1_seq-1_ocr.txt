The map alo exhibits "all tlie piivute runU of laud muilo and local ed in that province." New York, "compiled from uctual Kureys depoited in tho jiateut oflice nt New Yoiic."

Tot ii Ulfttorlt'H Considering how- the liUtUn v of an ad joining tow u has been criticized, one liuac ipiainted with the fucts might infer that either tin Umk wuh published ill u very bad nhape, or that the author is making a huudtome suuib its sale. We do not think it fair pku to have tho demerits or objVe tinus to u Im xjk published ami have nothing uiude public ultout the merits uud alue of it. Althmigh the Itook is ratlier ts thin for n two dollar look, vet it is -uito u Uxik nevertheless, ami if it was adorned with eiieraviiigs and free from u few omissions, we think mot jHspli would be very much pleased with it. lVrsons must not expect a history of u small town to bo published ut u small price, for the sale is limited to a few copies The history alluded to is nicel) Unuid and tho paper and print excellent, coding several hundred dollars for a few hundred books. Many lsvks must bo sold to pay fur publishing, and at u fuir price bo : and if an nuthor is trying to disosu of his work to rt-eoiupeiihe him for his tire some lnliors, we would rather encourage him than otherwise. Town histories ure valuable to others U'sides residents, Infiug an excellent lssk for reference. There are many items in such honks, such us the soldiers' record, that will post any one in a moment.

Other considerations than those of financial administration are to be taken into account with regard to wins key. There is a moral side to it.

"Nei ther, I presume, did Mr. Tilden when he wrote his remarkable letter. Hut we should change a remote chance into an absolute iuiKssjbility. If our weak and eXosed Hmts were strongly fortified ; if fcsluy we had by any chance even such a war us w had with Mexico, our enemy coutd procure ironclads in hurope that would menace our great cities with destruction or lay tliem under conttibutiou." "Put after the fortifications should Is constructed would you still maintain tho tux on whihkey "Yes," said Mr. HIaiue, "so long ns there is whiskey to tax I would tux it. and when the national government should have no u ao for tho money I would divide tho tax among the Federal Union with the specific object of lightening the tax on real etutc. The houses and farms of tho whole coun try pay too laige a proportion of the total taxes. If ultimately relief could be given in that direction it would, in my judgment, lo a wise and lieneficent policy. Some hon est but misguided friends of temperance have urged that the government should not use the money derived from the tax on w hiskey. Mv reply is that the tax on whis key by the Federal government, with its suppression of all illicit distillation and con sequent enhancement of price, tins been a powerful agent in the teinjerance reform by putting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount of whiskey consumed in the United States er capita today is not more than 40 per cent of that consumed thirty yean ago." Mr. Hlaine added that iu his judgment tho whiskey tux should bo so modified us to permit all who use pure alcohol in the arts or iu mechanical pursuits to havo it free ol tux, lu all such cases tho tax could bo re mitted without danger of fraud, just as now the tax on spirits expot tod is remitted.

The newspapers havo tins week retorted tho opening of a new cancer hospital for women, und it was mentioned, quite inci dent all v, that John Jacob Astor had urieu V.MrO.mio to the endow ment fund. How he came to do so remains for me to tell. Ann I Corrigan was a servant iu the Astor house hold. She developed a cancer. Hie fam ily doctor could not cure her, several spec ialists also failed, ami Ann died of a disease that piuzles and defies medical skill. Thus the subject of sulTeu'ng from cancer was brought to the attention of John Jacob As tor. A thousand philanthropists might have talked it to him without avail, for millionaires are calloused against charity appeals, but when he actually saw Ann Corrigan tortured to death, in spite of nil the hindrances that money could buy, hU pity wus reuched. He at once consulted w ith exiert medical ineii nnd they told him that jsissibly, under conditions favorable for close observation and experiment, a successful treatment for the disease might bo discovered.
