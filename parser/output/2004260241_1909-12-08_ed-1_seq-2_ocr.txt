R. MOORE . ... . Editor CHAS. L. SPRINGER, Business Mgr. THE MESSAGE President Taft's message to Congress submitted and read yesterday is more brief than those submitted by his prede cessor, and it might well have been briefer still, so far as Con ! gress is concerned. As a cam paign document the presidental message is worth the time spent on it. but Congress pays about as much attention as the Cor vallis city council did to Mayor Watters' special message in re gard to salaries raised by that Council. Congress is concerned with the president when there is '' a strong probability of him vetoing some pet measure, but at no other time. The presi dent's message is of chief service ' in assuring the public that some fellow with a chip on his shoulder .is still on the job.' j The most significant utterance in Pres. Taft's message is in re . ference to courts and ; legal pro ceedure. He says a haze of technicality both delays and de feats . iustice and - encourages criminality: Mr.- Taf t says; bur judicial system is "archaic and barbarous." Those who know all about it will agree heartily With this, and the fellow who knows nothing about it the fel low who hasonly a proper con ception of right and . wrong Will agree even more . heartily. . The next most ; worthy . sug gestion is an insistence ' upon a bereau of health. We are con stantly concerned with dollars and cents and yet health is the greatest wealth. A government bureau can not make a sick man well, but it can give . expert at tention to the great ; questions . affecting the. public's health and be instrumental in bettering gen eral conditions and perhaps pr- " ' venting occasional local epidemics that take a large toll. :;. ---: President Taft declares in favor of postal savings banks and ship subsidies, both of which are J good.' No nation "can grow: un less it saves, no nation can grow ' Satisfactorily "unless its ' com merce is expanded.1 No nation Will save large sums until' its citizens can save : in small amounts. - The Postal - Savings " banks will offer the opportunity, and a perfect guarantee to those with . large ..sums who will not t, bank. Our commerce is not ex panding, there are comparatively ' few American ships on the high "!seas. A ship subsidy or a merchant marine might relieve the present difficulty. ' It could not make the situation worse. , t The recommendation that per ; : locuciais ana magazines pay a higher ratevof postage is question- 1 able. Doubtless the ' magazines r can stand it, but why not cut out J some of the unnecessary postal ;; expense rather than make ran extra levy any wLerfe? A dozen letters and a hunlreM pounds of reports each year ' (feme to this office from government depart ments. Other p&wsparar offices in the U. S. and ' th$e are 21,-000-are treated similafifly. This office . has use for lews than one one-hundreth partypf his junk and'only the larger Irofnces of the city care for any t -f""der, able portion of it . - TL-V4 Ii- e at the newspaper offices cated at Chambers of Coir.f i . and different public, institui . It costs money to print this terial, money for paper, mo for mailing, tremendous su . ior naming over tne railroad lasis oi literature on nana snouia be furnished occasionally, and h " papers and public institutions want the literature they can get it. . The postal deficit can be cut out without levying any extra postage on anything.; The President would stop the "white slave" traffic and" asks $50,000 for a campaign to stop the recruiting - from among the immigrants. TheS government can afford $5,000,000 for this purpose. ' v. "The -message closes with a word of cheer, and an as surance that there is just now beginning a great business ex pansion. The president mentions the high cost of living, (the great increase in the cost,) and attri butes it to the proportionate in crease of gold, increase of popu lation, more . expensive mode of living and the lack of increased acreage production. - .-. f . Pres. Taft's massage is mild, not uncertain, but scarcely over emphatic. - His "judicial temper ament" shows in every line ' and the impression the message makes depends on. one's con ception of judges. ;; It is our distinct impression that it was the president's aim to say no thing that would arouse Congress to criticism or that the American people could construe as 'play ing to the. galleries." As a re sult the message is tamei ' com pared . with his predecessor's, but doubtless as v effective,, for none of them count with Con gress.'?,. ;.
