EXTRACTS FROH MESSAGE. Important Recommendations Made President Roosevelt in His Message to Congress* In his message sent to congress Tues gay President Roosevelt trained his heavy artillery on one subject—the gulation of corporations doing ah inter state business, particularly the railroads He avoids raising an issue on other im portant questions, but with all the strength of his strenuous uature, he in sists that the railroads must give the people "a square deal. " After congratulating the people of the country upon the nation's prosperity, the president plunges into the question of tho regulation of corporations doing an interstate business. v "The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay, " says the president. • 'Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked when it acts against law and justice. After declaring that state regulation would be ineffective, the message sounds the keynote of the president's plan; "I believe that this regulation and supervision can be obtained by the enact ment of law by the congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly be necessarly ultimately to confer in fullest form such power upon the national gov ernmeht by a proper amendment of the constitution." The transportation companies must be dealt with first, declares the president. The most importani provision which such law should contain is that confer ring upon some competent administra tive body the power to decide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate is reasonable and just, and, if it is found to be unjust, then, after full inve-tigation, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go-the maximum reasonable rate this decision to go into effect with in a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the conrts. ' It sometimes happens, not that a rate is too higb, but that a favored shipper is given too low a rate. In such case the commission would have the right to fix this already established minimum rate as the maximum, and it would need only one or two such decisions to cure railroad companies of the practice of giving improper minimum rates." A most stringent anti-rebate law is urged, "It might be wise to confer on the government the right of civil action against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate; this would help stop what is really blackmail. " The president insists that private car lines, refrigerator charges and other de vices of the skilled rebater, should also come nnder tbe supervision of the gov ernment; and Uncle 8am should be clothed with full power to examine the road's books. Discussing the problem of capital and labor, the president says: "In tthe past the most direful among the influences which have been brought about the downfall of republics has ever been the growth of the class spirit. If such a spirit grows up in this republic it will ultimately prove fatal to ns. This government is not and never shall be a government by a plutocracy. This government is not and never shall be government by a mob." The message deals briefly with the in surance problem. "It has b fen only too clearly shown," says tbe president, "that certain of the men at the head of re I» * i

The president handles the tariff ques tion gingerly. The revenues must equal the (expenditures. he says. Last year there was a deficit. Unless the deficit can be met in some other the revenue laws mast be revised. These changes, if made, should be along the lines of reciprocity. Economy is urged, including tbe abolishment of the office of receiver of public money in land offices. A more elastic currency is suggested, but the president does not father a plan, The need of a thorough reorganization of the executive departments is pointed out. Federal supervision and way "All contributions by corporations to any political committee or for any po litical purpose should be forbidden by law, ft says the president in urgiug a more stringent law controlling federal elections. The president announces the second The Hague peace conference and, while eulogizing those who are working for international arbitration, contends that general disarmament is impossible at this time, rid of the canses of war than of the im plements of war." The Monroe doctrine is dealt with at length. The president probably has the Venezuelan problem in mind, as he writes: "Under no circumstances will the United States use the Monroe doc trine as a cloak for territorial aggres Moreover, we must make it evi dent that we do not intend to permit the Monroe doctrine to be need by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect it from the consequences of its own misdeeds against foreign nations." Tbe president nrges legislation to make the army not larger, but more efficient. To this end he suggests dacing the number of army posts and increasing the importance of those re maining. The navy should not be increased be yond the present number of units. It is necessary, however, to substitute effi cient for inefficient units, as the latter become worn oat.
