Mr. Wiij:bt moved to amend the resolution so as to make the call upon the President instead ol the Secretary ot War. In a time like this he was willing to tru?t tbe Piesiilent, and he wanted none of that miserable doctrine that could be loyalty to the (to eminent and disloyalty to the Admiuis tiaiiou. There was onlv an unconditional lovaltv to the Government and the party iu j-ower at a timelik this. According to this abiuid ilr. W light, the pen pie, who have jut been voting down "ihe party in power," at the November election, are alt "disloyal." The entire city of New Yui k. where the Republicans were not able to elect even a Common Councilman, must be stee(ed to thv eyes and ears in treason; ditto, New Jersey ;iHito, Ohio, Illinois, and old Connecticut even, (if town electious mean any thing.) The Senator from Indiana talks like a madman or a New York Express. Tlie Frekldt-nt's Logic. T he Boston Courier, in an article on that por tion of the President's message which attributes the cause of the war to the existence of aluverv, says: . . . , . , , Mr. Lincoln's ingenious, though not original observation, that, if there had been no slavery there would have been no rebellion. h,s gome times been compared wi;h the equally logical e quence, that if no one traveled on the highways with money iu his pockets, there wouid be in highwaymen. The truth is, we may begin in such a chain of reasoning jut where we tee fit. It the world had not been create!, with various ;race upon it, of diverse characteristics, capai i ties and dtsixtHi'ioYis; if the necessities, or opin .tu. or prejudices of society were not such us they are, we should have had no free-oil party, no Chicago pUtform.no division among tha Dem ocratic prty, giving the opportunity lor the Re publican minority to succeed, and consequently, no Mr Lincoln for President. In the latter cae we should, of course, have had no rebellion. CJPThe Republicans ol New Hampshire will hold their State Convention on New Year's day Lafayette Journal.

A rieet After the Alabama. Tbe New Yoik World of the 12th says: It is not worth while to conceal the fact that a whole licet of steamers are alter the Alabama. The Yandetbilt sailed yesterday from the "Lights." direct to Fayal, and run? a fair chince of falling in with the pirate on the way. She is supposed to meet there two United Sntes steam men of-war, detached from a foreign squadron, and the three will then take a different cour?e. The names of the steamers cannot be given. At the Brooklyn Navy-yard, at preei:t, there are two sple.idid re;ulir nvv steim Irig ites, and one ten knot steamer," all of which will Le off in a few fiys At Ihistou another fire fast steamer is ready to leate.

Tbe secret fact connected with this matter are as follows: Soon after, the commencement of the present troubles, certaiu atubmous ,epubl;can' resi.l l"g the western pait of Viruuia cone to this city iml had an interview with the President nd with all the members ol the Cabinet enept Mr. Cameron, who was .l.en Secretary of War. They , Rave out, while here, that they lud Leen teut lor by the Pi evident, and the probability ii that they told the truth. Certain it i-, they returned to their houiei elated at the prospect of very oon being the Governor, the Senators, the Judges, Hiid the other chief bt .te ofliceia of a uew Stie; and very $o-n alter, the incijient steps were taken iu order to cause a few of the western counties in Virginia to r-ecede fiout that Slate, and to orm n new State, which was to luve the euphonious designation of Kanawha. I need not recapitulate the arguments proving the unconstitutionality of the admission m a Slate of these counties. They will be found in the able speeches of Mr Conway,' of Kansas Mr. Logan, of . Virginia, and Mr. Th.iddeus Stevens, of Pennsylvania, who, to bis honor be it said, refused to be dragooned into the support of the wicked bill. Rut the readers ol the Times. oiigbt to keep constantly in mind the following facts in relation to this grave subject: 1st, The Sute of Virginia is us mu'-h one and indi vi-alile astheStateoi Illinois It is not iu the power of a sin ill fraction of her people to divide her any mote th n it is iu the power of a Urge portion ol her people to drag her out of the Union. The people of the north west counties of Illinois have as much right to seceie Iroin ihe Slate ol Illinois, and lorin "the State of :iiena." as the people ol these western counties of Vircinia have to form a new .Stale out of part of Viiginia. The fact that the State of Vhginia is iu rebellion does not ulie.-thec i.se Viiginia is sti'lone ol the United States. No one can deny that. When the Union m restored, f.u will lake her place again iu the Union as one ol the States. Rut never, urctr w ill ehe return to the Union shorn of her strength, turt uleO of her fair proportions, or with an inch ol her territory taken from her. 21. The designs of the Piesident and his Cabi net are by thee developments completely un masked. Those designs contemplate nothing less than the asfumtioii of irresponsible and diu tatoral powers by the Administration; the ne t tion of at least six new States, carved in this man ner out of six exiting States; the admission into the Union also, as States, of lour or five new Territories, with the certainty of getting from these ten or eleven new States no less than twenty or twenty-two new Senator, creatuies who will owe their seats in the Sena'e to the in trigues of the Administration, and who will be but the slavish instruments to execute the be bests ol the Executive. These are ihe risks w e are running from our "Republican" Administration; risks involving the utter ubversioii of our republican form ol government, and its eh inge into the most grind ing tyranny and the most absolute despotism. Pet haps ihe lesson was needed, in order that ihe people might learn the value of Democratic principles. Certain it is, that when, m year from next fall, the people have an opjiortunity to ex pi ess their sentiments iu regard to "Republican" rule, they will do it with an emphasis thai will be the end of this bogus kind ,of "Republicanism" lore v er. It is pleasing to look through the gloom that now envelops the nation to the bright future that is certainly in store tor us two years hence. Ry that time, the madness which has ruled the hour hitherto will have passed away. Ry that time, the Congress, whose powers will legally com uience on the 4;h ot M-rch next, will have done imii.li toward piepaiing the way for a restoration of the Union When ome the South is con inced that the Northern States hae repuoiated that od om political heresy, modern "Renuhli t ani-in, an I ha e returned to the Democratic faith, und bae ptauted their feet bunk on the rock ot the Constitution, they will have no object iu continuing the warauy longer, but will lay down their arms and return to the Union. There is little prospect that the war will terminate le fore that time, unless it is terminated by foreign intervention. If it is matmged in the future as it has been in the past, it will certainly not have a successful termination. But it may be dragged on for two years longer, till our rivers run red with blood, till half a million of men have fallen victims to "Republican" fanaticism, and till the land is failed with widows and orphans, who?ecry for justice will not be unheeded. Then, when all thl i past, will come the re action. The Union will be restored ns of old Congress will once more reassemble, with a lull delegation in both houses from the fifteen South ein States. A Democratic President will end in a Democratic message. It will have something to say attout white people, and the interests of white men. The Congress will proceed to busi ness. If Sumter, and Lovejoy. mid Wilson, and Wade, and Ch indler nie there, they w ill take care to keep civil tongues iu their heads, and to speak gingerly when they allude to "our wayward sis ters." United and powerfuloncemore.no foreign nation will ngain dare to insult us. Tbe Monroe doctrine will be revived and enforced All things will be restored as they were before the war, and (efoie the election which led to the war. The stars and tripes will wave over every State. Rut the institutions of every State will be left for each State to regulate for themselves. Slavery being a necessity in the Southern States, it will exist ihere. Ail the ur.justand illegal und unconstitu tional legislation of the present Congress will be repealed by thr Congre nf the v hole nation then. The men who strut their biief hour now will then be consigned to an endless oblivion. The four years ot "Republican" rule will be a thing of the past an epoch ot warnii.g for the future Wc will be weighed down bv the burden of hetvv t"xes and enormous debts; but we will be once uioie united and free The land will be filled with de-olate homes and achinz hearts, and for these theie can be no e irthlv recompense.

Refore Bunide gets rery far he will find that thete are lions in his patent path Tnere is no point on that rad wheie our troops cannot con centrate more rapidly than he can advance. 1 he Federal.Gover:iinetit and Generals seem to hue supposed that they would meet aiih no oppo-i tion till they reu bei Hanover Junction, and have doubtless lelt some confusion of mind at finding Lee before them at Frederic kburg. They have stof pel a wtek near that helple-s and inde fensible village; aid if they get iuto it, they will rind it harder to leave than to enter. Thev have arranged iu the Cbnet tint thete v'ould bo io battle till their aruiv reached Hanovi-r; but they may find the plains around Fredericksburg, the highlands in fiont and ihe river in their tuck, the prettiest place to be drubbed in that Yankees ever saw. The whole scheme, now freely displayed by their journals, in the confidence of success, is eminently characteristic of the smartest nation in all creation. They are undoubtedly an ingenious people, but prune, as ingenious people frequently are, to the pleasing delusion that all others but themselves are imbeciles and idiots. Neither Scott nor McCiellan, nor any other competent military leader, would ever counsel or undertake a march on Richmond by the lines ol the railroads. These were highly favorable to the drummers ol the gi eat manufacturing powers, but less so to those who w alk at tin-, head of he i vil v armed regiments. The vulnerable side of Rich mond is still what military infellinen e and expe lience for n hundred years have pointed out, her river. The llriiish got here that way without much difficulty. McCiellan attempted to follow their track with one hundred and lil'tv thousand men. and would hive got here, too, but for "Chickahoniiny!" Fortunate for us it is that he found that warder at our gate-1. The interview with that personage, and ins greeting ot b'ood and mud, appear lo have given the Yankees so gteit a disgust for the Yok aid the James. :md the pleasant swamp between, that they utterlv re fuse to go there any mote. It appears, indeed, that they have determined to ive the mail Ih-e a f i ial ; and we should not re illy credit tl eir boldness, but for Ihe grett ra pacity they xissess nt this time to fill the field The new lev, even if it has not actual! v re u lied the six bundled thousand demanded in July, has certainly brought n rodigious number of men under nuns. Massed with their old rioop.s, the United States cannot have less than eight hnn died thousand men in the-r tirmv at this moment Abstracting from this bine host all tint themo! extravagaiitcalciilatioti cm pretend for the armies of the WeM, and gumd of Washington, the Northern Government have still some four hun died thousand men to throw at Ivit-hmood ; and however much ihe superior valor ol men who fiht lor aiis et foci, rn iy do, when guide by the :bler Generals of the Smth. while holding the vantage ground of po-iiion, there are limits be yond which the weight of numbers will tell. It is on their overwhelming numbers that ihn North ate now iletet mined to ielv Relieving th it all dei-emls on the immediate destt uction of the Con federate organiz ition, which might be eile -ted bv the captuie of Ri huiond und the c inpie-t ot Virginia, thev have detei mine 1 to lu.-h stiaiht foiward t he prize with ail their forte. Hut should hiefs place this view hexond doubt, let us hpe that the Go eminent is pepared to -ouceu träte, in deten-e of the Capital, iiuuibeis cqu al to any army of Yankees likely to reach this neigh boi hood after the depletion ol the battles and the march they must first accomplish. Events indicate the approach of nother cris's in our affairs. A people wh have pii-scd tlmnigh a trial to their fortitude and energy u h ns we have once had to endure, m'ght be excused for hoping an 1 believing that il e wimld never know another like it Tho-e who lived in Richmond last June, ami still lived in July, nruht letsona bly suppose lb it the bitterness m le dh had p issed them, never to return Ii those days we had but to raise our ey es to f-e the b illoons f the enemy watching us lrtm ihe sky. In sight of our steeple, onlv four miles from ourlors, an army of a hundieti und tiny thousand 'neu formcl a vast hall' moon before ami nroun! t.s No man knew the day would pass withouut the commence ment of a bu-iue-s. tint might brietlv end in the assault, sack ami conflagration of the tiwn words which we do nit care to lehne and vivify by analysis, and detail. This lasted for months; and when we remember' it, we cannot refr.iu from wonder while recollecting the courage ami composure, amounting alupist in indifference, w-ith which the population supported it Few wouhl believe in delvat, and still fewer were frightened. That noMe confidence in -'O'l and the anus of the South was well rewtr.lel. For oneltv that vast host dissolve like a cloud before tlie shock of thunder. A bleeding, nitngled mass, crouching tor safety in the corner of the i i ver.wns all tint then rem lined F the most splendid mili tary array of the age Our danger had gone like hii evil dieam or nightmre. and thoe who awakened in security might be pardoned for Itelieviug that it could never return.. It requires some effort t' brace ihe nerves for a similar and perhaps a mie terrible ordeal. Let us hope that those who were once ab'e to confront death wiih dignity can again look with a steady glance on the direful phantom with which they then gainel acquaintance, und have fri 111 the band of iron to grasp il.e hand of bone.
