FtUowCititene of the Senate and Jhuie of JSepretenlativte: -.Ift the midst of unprecedented polit ical troubles, we Lave cause of great fratitude to God for unusual good ealth and most abundant harvests. You will not be surprised to learn that ill the peculiar exigencies of the times our ' intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solici tude, chiefly turning upon our own do mestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have during the whole year been engaged in an attempt to divide and destroy the Union. A nation which endures factious domestic divisions is exposed to disrespect a broad, and one party, , if not both, is sure sooner or later to invoke foreign intervention. Nations thus tempted to interfere are not always able to re sist the counsels of seeming expediency and ungenerous . ambition, although measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to be unfortunate and inju rious to those adopting them. " The disloyal citizens of the United ' States, who have offered the ruin of our country in return for the aid and eomfort which they have invoked a broad, have received less patronage and encouragement than they probably ex pected. If it were just to suppose, as the insurgents have seemed to assume, that foreign nations, in this case, dis carding all moral, social and treaty ob ligations, would net solely and selfishly tor tue most speedy restoration 01 com merce, including especially the acquisi tion of eotton, those nations appear, as yet, not to have seen their way to their object more directly or clearly through the 'destruction than through the pres ervation of the Union. If we could dure to believe that foreign nations are ac tuated by no higher principle than this I am quite sure a sound argument could be made to show to them that they can reach their aim more readily and easily by aiding to.jcrush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to it. The principal lever relied on by the insur gents for exciting 'foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intima ted, is the embarrassment of commerce. Those nations, however, not improba bly, saw from the first that it was the union which made our foreign as well as domestic commerce. They can ecarce lyj have. failed .to perceive that the ef fort; for disunion produces the existing difficulty, and that one strong nation promises more durable pence and a more extensive, valuable and reliable commerce than cart the same nation broken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign states, because whatever might bo their wishes or .dispositions, the integrity of our country and the stability of Government mainly depend not upon them, but on the loyalty, vir tue, patriotism and intelligence of the American people The correspondence itself, with the usual reservations, is herewith submitted. I venture to hope that it will appear that we have prac ticed prudence and liberality towards foreign powers, (averting causes of irri tation, and with firmness maintaining ourown rights and honor. Since, how ever, it is apparent that here as in every-state, foreign dangers necessarily attend domestic difficulties , I recom mend that adequate and ample meas ures be adopted for maintaining the public defenses on every side. , While under this; general . recommendation !rovision for defending our sea coast iiie already occurs to the mind, I also in the same connection, ask the atten tion of Congress to our great lakes and rivers: '" It is believed that some fortifi cation and depots of armv an 1 muni . tions? with harbor and navigation im provements; at well selected points upon these, would bo of great import ance to .the national defense and pres ervation, ' .; , T k tttentioa to the views of the Secre tary ot V er expressed in his report upon the 8n.e general subject. I deem it of im portance that the loyal region of East Ten neweertnd "Western North Carolina should be connected with Kentucky a. nd other faithful parts of the "Union by railroad. I theielore recommend, as a military measure, . that Congress provide lor the conat ruction of such road an speedily as possible.- Kentucky no. doubt will co oppeiaie, and: through ber Legislature muke the most-judicious select ion of a line. ' The northern terminus must connect with some existing railroad, ' and whether the route shall I from Lexington or NirhoIdBville to the Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennessee line in the direction of Knosville, or on some still diff erent line, can easily be detei mined. - Ken tucky and the general government co opera ting, the work can be completed in a very short time, and when done it will be not on ly Of Vast present usefulness, but also a valu able permanent improvement, worth its cost ia all the .temporary future. .. ,. ;.: . , , ; , gome treaties, designed chiefly for the in terests of commerce, and having no grave po litica! importance; have been- negotiated and Will be aubmitted to the Senate lor their con sideration, Although we hava failed to induce- some of , the., commercial Powers to a-' dopt desirable melioration of the rigor of tarstime War, we have removed allbstruct ions train the way ol this humane reform, except each, M are. merely ofa temporary and accidental occurrence. , , ,. " . 1 invite your attention to the correspon dence between her Brittanic Majesty's Min ister, icoredited to this . Government, and the Beerelaryof 8tate,rslative;to the detention of the; British ship ftriMire, in June last by the United States steamer Maswchusstts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detention was occasioned by an obvious isMptwkeDslon f the hots, and u justki reqaires that we should commit no belliger ent set not banded on strict right, as sanc tioned by publio law, I recommend that to apprepriatioa be made to satisfy the reasonable-demands ef the owners of the vessel for -, krittloa J iv ',.."-, ; I repeat the recommendation f ' pre decessor in his annual message to Congress in December last, in regard to the disposi tion of the surplus which will probably re main ater satisfying the claims of American citizens against Chins, pursuant to the awards of the commissioners, under the Act of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be deemed adviable to carry that recom mendation into (fleet, I would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal over the proceeds of the surplus relered to, in good securities, with a view to the satis faction of such other just claims of our citi zens against China as are not unlikely to a-, rise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that Empire. By the Act of the 5th of August last, Congress suthorized the President to instruct toe commanders of suitable vessels to defend themselves against and to capture pirates. This authority hss been exercised in a single instance only, t or the more eneetual pro tection of our extensive and valuable com merce, in the Eastern seas especially, it seems to me that it would also be advisable to authorize the commanders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and their car goes, and the Consular Courts now establish ed by law in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in event that this should not be objected to by the local authorities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in withholding our recogni tion of the sover. ignty and independence of tiayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the appro bation of Congress. 1 submit, for your consideration, the expe diency of an appropriation for maintaining a cliarge-deafl'tiirs near each cf these new States. It does not admit of doubt thnt im portant commercial advantages might be se cured by favorable treaties with them. The operations of the Treasury during the petiod which has elapsed since your adjourn ment have 'oeerrcenducted with signal suc cess. The patriotism of the people has pla ced at l he disposal of the government the large means demanded ly the public exigen cies. Much of the National Loan has been taken by citizens nf the industrial classes, whose confidence in their country's faith and zeal lor their country's deliverance from pre sent peril have induced them to contribute to the support of the government the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact impo ses peculiar obligations to economy in dis bursetnent and eneigv in action. . The revenue from all sources for the finan cial year ending on the 30;h of June, 3861, was eighty-six millions eight hundred and thirty-five thousand nine hundred dollars and twenty-seven cents, and the expenditures for ihe same period, including payments on ac count of the public debt, were eighty-four million five hundred and seventy eight thou sand eight hundred and thirty-tour dollars and torty-seven cents, leaving a balance in ihe treasury on the 1st of July, of two mil lion two hundred and fifty seven thousand and sixty-five collais and eighty cents. For the first quarter of the financial ycar ending on the 3(ith of September, 1SG1. the receipts from all sources, including the balanee'of 1st of July, were one hundred and two million five hundred and nine dollats and twenty seven cents, and the expenses ninty-eight million two hundred and thirty nine thou sand seven hundred and thirty-three dollars and nine rents, leaving a balance on the 1st of Oc'oler, 1861, of four- million two hun dred and ninety -two thousand seven bun dled and Ecventy bix dollars and eighteen cents, - Estimates for the remaining three quarters of the year, and for the financial year 1863, together with his views of ways and nieuns for meeting the demands, contemplated by them, will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenditures made neces sary by the rebellion are not beyond ihe re sources of the 1 al people, and to believe that the same pan iotibiu which has thus far sustained the government will continue to sustain it till peace and union shall .again bless the land. 1 rei-pecltully refer to the report of the Secretary of War for information respecting the numerical strength of the army, and for recommendations having in view an increase ol its efficiency and tlio well being of the va rious branches olthe service entrusted to his care. - It is gratifying to know that the patriot ism of the people has proved equal to the occasion, and that the number at troops ten dered (reatly exieed the force which Con gross authorized me to call into the field I refer with pleasure to thoBe 6rlions of his report which make allusion to the creditable dvgree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to J.he excellent sanitary condi tion of 'he entire army. The recommenda tion of ihe S.-cretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform I asis is a subject ot vital importance to the future safety of the country and is commen ded to the serious attention of Congress. The large addition to the regular array, in connection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his rec oinmendation lor increasing the corps of ca dets to the greatest capacity cf the military academy.'1 By mere omission, I presume, Congress bos tailed to provide chaplains for hospitals occupied by volunteers. Thiit sub ject was brought to my notice and I was induced to draw up the torm ot a letter, One copy ol which, properly addressed, has been de ivered to each of the persons, and at the dates respectfully named, and stated in a schedule containing also the form of the let ter marked A, and is herewith transmitted. These gentlemen, 1 understand, entered upon the duties designated ot the times respect ively stated in the schedule, and hare labor ed (aithfully therein ever since, and therefore recommend that they tie compensated at the same rate as chaplains in the army, and fur ther suggest that general provision be made for chaplains to serve at hospitals as well as with regiments. -''''; ' i ; 1 The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations,' of chat branch of the set vice, the activity and' ener gy which have characterized its administra tion; and the results of measures to increase its efficiency and power. Such have been tho additions, by construction and purchase, that it may almost be said a navy has been created and brought into service since our difficulties commenced. 1 Besides blockading our extensive coasi, squaarons larger than ev er before assembled under our flag have been put afloat, and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown, j i I would invite special attention to the rec ommendation of the Secretary for a more perfect organization of the navy, by introdu cing additional gradee ia the service. The priisent organization i defective and unsat isfactory, and the suggestions submitted by the department will, it ia bslieved, if adopt ed, obviate the difficulties alluded to, promote harmony, and increase the ifOeiency of the navy. .-. syu v. '.There are three vacancies on the bench of thn Supreme Court, two by the--decease of J notices Daniel and McLean and en h tha resignation ofJustice Campbell 1 hava w far forborne making nominations to fill these i master General, the following being a sum vacancies, for reasons which I will now state, mary statement of the condition of the De Two of the outgoing Judges resided within partment. The revenue from all scources, the States now overrun by revolt, so that if: during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1861, successors were appointed in the same local- including the annual permanent appropria tes they could not now serve upon their circuits, and many of the most competent men there probably would not take the per sonal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme Bench. I have been un willing to throw all the appointments North ward, thus disabling myself from doing jus tice to the South on the return of peace, al though I may remark, that to transfer to the North one which has heretofore been in the South, would not, with reference ta ter ritory and population, be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into an empire, al though too large for any one Judge to give the courts therein more than a nominal at tendance, arising in pep ulation from one mill ion four hundred and seventy thousand and eighteen in 1830 to six millions one hundred and fifty one thousand four hundred and five in 1860. Besides this the country generally has outgTown our present judiciary. If uniformity was at ill intended, the sys tem requires that all the States shall be ac commodited with Circuit Courts, attended by Supreme Judges; while, in fact, Wiscon sin, Minnesota, Iowa,, Kansas, Florida, Tex as, California and Oregon have never had any such Courts. Nor can this well be rem edied without a change of the system, be cause the adding of Judges to the Supreme Court, enough for the accommodation of all pares of tha country with Circuit Courts, would create a Court altogether too numer ous for a judicial body of any sort and the evil of it be one which will increase as new Slates come into the Union. Circuit Courts, too, arc useful or they are not useful. If use ful, no State shou'd be denied them. ' If'Qot useful, no State should have them. Lot them b? provided for all, or abolished as to all. Three modifications occur to me, either of which, I think, would be an improvement, up on our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every ev ent! then, 1st, let the whole country be divi ded into Circuits of convenient fizo, the Su preme Judccs to serve in a number of them corresponding to their own nnmber, and in dependent Circuit Judges be provided for all the rest; or, secondly, let the Supreme Judg es be relieved from Circuit duties, and Cir cuit Judges provided for all the Circuits; or, ihirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts alto gether, leaving the judicial function wholly to the District Courts and an independent Supreme Court. I respectfully recommend to the consider- a ion ot Congress the present condition of the statu'e laws, wuh tho hope that Congress will be able to find an rasy remedy for many of the inconveniences and evils which con- stantly'cn.barras those engaged in the prac tical administration orthein. Bmce ibe or ganization of,the goTernmeut, Congress has enacted some fivs thousand acts and joint re solutions, which fill more1 than s x thousand closely prin ed pages, and are scattered thro many volumes. Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or m conflict with each other, or at least so doubtful as to render it very diffi cult for even the best informed person to as certain precisely what the statute law really is. -'It seems tome very important that the laws should be made as plain and inteligible is possible, and be leduced to as small a com pass as may consist wuh the fullness and precision of the will of the Legislature, and the perspicuity of its language, i Ins, well done, would, 1 think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the adminisira'ion of the laws, and would be a la-ting bentfit to the people by placing be fore tbcm in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so deeply concern their in-eiest and their duties. I am informed by some whose opinions 1 respect that all the Acts of Congress now in force, and of a per manent general nature, mi2;ht be revised and rewritten so ns to be embraced in one volume or at most two volumes of ordinary and con venient sizp, find I respect fully recommend to Congress to consider the subject, and if my suggestion be approved, to devise such plan as to their wisdom shall feem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed. One of the unfav. r.ble consequences of the pres ent insurrection is the entire suppression in many places of all ordinary means of admin istering civil justice by the officers and in the forms of existing law. This is the ca'e in whole or in part in all the insurgent States, and as our simies advance upon and take possession of parts of those States, the prao tical evil becomes more apparent. There are no crurts nor officers to whom ihe citizens of other Stales may apply lor the en'o'Cement of their lawful claims against citizens of insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt constituting such claims some have estimated it as high as two hun dred million dollars due in a la'ge part from insurgents in open rebellion to loyal citizens who are even now making great sacrifice in discharge of their patriotic duty to support the government. Under these circumstances 1 have been earnestly solicited to establish by military power courts to administer sum mary justice in such cases. 1 have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed, the collection of debts, was just and right in itself, but be cause I have been'unwilling to go beyond the pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise of powers; but the powers of Congress, I sup-. pose, are equal to the snamaious occasion, and therefore i refer the whole matter to Congress, with the hope that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice in all such parts of the insurgent States and territories as may be under the control of this government, whether byV voluntary return to allegiance and oider, or by the power of arms. This, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary substitute, and cease as soon as the nidinary courts can be re-established in peace. It is important that some more convenient means should be pro vided, if possible, for the anjustment-of claims against the government, especially in view of the increased number by lesson of the' war. It is as much the duty of governmect to ren der prompt justice against itself 4n favor of oitizens as It is to administer tile same b tweon private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of claims in their nature be long to the Judicial department; besides it is apparo.it that the attention of Congress will he more than usually engaged for some time to come with great National questions. It Was intended' by i the organization of the Court of Claims mainly to temove this branch of business from the- halls of Congress, but while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of investigation, it in a great degree foils to effect the object of Ha creation, for want ot power to make its judg ments final. : Fully aware ot the delicacy, not to tay the danger of the subject. I com mend to your careiul consideration whether this power of making judgments final mav not properly be given to the court, reserving IDI rignv in appeal vu quwiiuHS Ol law to the Supreme Court, with audi other provia ion as experience may have shown to be ne- ceaeoryv-i-M m.-t.num fat .i.ia ' I ask attention to the report, o f the-' Poet tion of $7,CXX),000 lor the transportation of free mail matter, was $9,040,296 40, being about two percent, loss than the revenue for 1860. In the same time the expenditures $13,606,759 11, showing a decrease of more than eight percent, as compared with those of the previous year, and lenving an excess of expenditures over the last fiscal year ol 557,462 71. The gross revenue for the year ending J une 30th,- 1863, is estimated at an increase of four per cent, on that of 1861, making $6,683,000, to which should be add ed the earning of the department in carry- ing free matter, viz: $700,000, making $9, 383.000. The total expenditures for 1863 are estimated at $i2,528,000,leaving an esti mated deficiency ol $3,145,000, to be sup plied from the Treasury in addition to the permanent appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, that tho extension o I this District across the rolo mac river at the time of establishing the Capitol here was eminently wise; and con sequently that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies within the State of Virginia was unwise and dangerous. I sub mit for your conaideratien the expediency of requiring that part of the District and the restoiation of the original boundaries thereof through negotiations with the State of Vir ginia. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying rtocu- ments, exhibits , the condition of the several branches of the publio bu siness Jpcrtaining to that Department The depressing influence of the insur rection have been especially felt in the operations ot.the ratent and Ueneral Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the past year have exceeded the expenses of our land system only about two hun dred thousands dollars. The laws have been entirely suspended in the Southern StateC while the interrup tions to the business of the country,and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service have ob structed settlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest. ! The receipts of the Patent Office have declined in nine months about one hundred thousand dollars, render ing a large reduction of the force em ployed neeessrry to make itself sus taining. , The demand upon the Pen sion Office will be largely increased by the .insurrection,'- Numerous applica tions for pensions, based upon, the cnus altk'8 of the existing war have already been made. There is.Tcason to believe that many who are now upon the pen sion rolls and in -.receipt of the bounty of -the eovernmeut are in the. ranks of the insurgent army, or ' giving them aid or comfort. The Secretary of the Interior has directed a suspension of the payniept of the pensions ot such fersons upon proof ot their disloyalty, recommend that Congress authorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pension rolls. The relations of the government with the Indian tribes have been great ly disturbed by the insurrection, espe cially in the Southere superinteiidciicy and in that of New Mexico. The In. dian country south of Kansas is in the posession of insurgents from Texas and Arkansas. Agents of the United Stales, appointed since tho 4th of March for this snperiiitendency, have been unable to reach'tbeir posts, while the most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the in surrectionary cause and assumed to exercise the powers of agents; by vir tue of commissions ironi tho insurrec tionists. It has been stated in the public press , thnt a portiou of these Indians have been organized as a mili tary force, and are attached to the ar niy of the insurgents. Although the government has no official information upon this subject, letters have been written to 'the .Commissioner of Indian Affairs, by several prominent chiefs, riving assurance ot their loyalty to tho United States, and - exnressinc a wish for the presence of t ederal troops to protect them, it is believed that upon the reposcssion of the country by the Federal forces, the Indians- will readily ' cease 1 all hostile demonstra tions and resume their former relations to the government. , ' Agriculture, confesedly the largest in terest of the nation, has not a depart ment or a bureau, but a clearkship as signed to it by the government. While it i fortunate that this great interest is so independent in its nature as to. not have demanded and extort ed more from the government, I rV spectfully ask , Congress to consider whether something more- cannot be given voluntarily with general advant age. , - " Annual reports exhibiting tho condi tion of our agriculture, commerce' and manufactures would present a fund of information of great practical, value to the country. While I make no sugges tions as to details, 1 venture llie opin ion that an agricultural and statistical bureau might profitably be organized. The execution of the laws for the . sup pression; of the' African Slave ,' trade hnsbeen confined (o the Department of the ' Interior. It is a subject of gratulation that the. efforts that hare been made lor tho suppression of this human traffid have been recently ; atten ded with unusual success. ,t Five ves sels being fittedr but for the slave trade have been; seized and condemned.- Two mates ot vessels engaged in the trade mii! one person in, equipping a vessel as a slaver have been convicted and subjected to the penalty, of fine and imprisonment, and one captain ta ken with a cargo of Africans on board his vessel has been convicted of the highest grade- of offense1 1 under ' our laws, the punishment of which 1 is death. The J territories' of Colorado. Dakotah, and Naveda, created by the last Congress have been organized, and civil administration has been inaugura ted therein, under auspices especially gratifying, when it is considered that the leaven oi treason wai - louna exist ing in some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there. The abundent natural resorces ot these Teiritories, with the security and protection afforded by arganized government, will doubtless invite to them a large emmigration when peace shall restore the business of the coun try to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legia laiure of Colorado, which evidence the patriotic spirit ot the people of the Territory. So far 1h authority of the United States has been upheld in all the Territories, as it is hoped it will be in future. I commend their inter ests and defence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress. I recommend to tho favorable consid eration of Congress the interests of the JJistnct ot Columbia. Ihe insurrec tion has been the cause of much suffer ing and sacrifice to its inhabitants, and as they have no representative in Con gross; that body should not overlook their just claims upon the tjovernmeF.t. At your late session a joint resolution was adopted, authorizing the President to take measures for facilitating a prop er representation ot the industrial in dustrial interests ot the United States at the exebilion of the industry of all nations, to be holdcn at London in the year 1862. - I regret to say that I have been una ble to give personal attention to this subject a Mibject at once so interest ing in itself and so extensively and in mately connected with the material prosperity of the world. Through the Secretaries of Slate and of the Interi or a plan or system has been devised and partly matured,- and which will be laid before you. Under and by virtue of the act of Congress entitled "on act to confiscate property used for insur rectionary purposes" approved Aug., Cth, 1861, the legal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of cer tain other persons have become forfeit ed and numbers of the latter, thus lib erated, are already dependant on the United States and must be provided for in some way. Besides this it is not impossible that some of the States will pftss similar enactments for their oy,n benefits respectively, and by operation of which persons of the same class w ill be-thrown-upon them lor disposal. In such ease I recommend that Congress provide for accepting ' such persons from such States, according to some mode of valuation in lieu protanto of direct taxes or upon some other plan to be agreed -on with such States re spectively that ! such persons on such acceptance by the general government, be at once declared :free, and that in any event, steps be taken tor coloniz ing both classes, of the one first men tioned, if the other shall not be brought into existence, f t oiiie place r p'act s 1 1 climate congenial to them. It might bo well to consider, too, whether the free colored people already in the Uni ted Stales could not, so tar as individ uals may ' desire, be included in such colonization. . To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also the appropriation of money beyond that to be expended in the territorial acquisition. Having practiced the ocqusilion of territory for nearly sixty years, the question ot constitutional power to ao so is no onger an open one. With us the pow ?r was questioned at first with Mr. Jefferson, who however in the purchase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea ot great expediency. ' If it be said that the only legitimate object of ac quiring territory is to furnish homes for white, men,- this - measure effects that object, for the emigration of col ored men leaves additional room for white men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however, placed the im portance of procuring Lotisiaoa more on political and commercial grounds than procuring room for population.' Un the whole proposition, including the appropriation of money, with the j acquisition of territory does not, the expediency amounts to absolute neces sity that without which tho govern ment itself cannot be prepettiated. J he war continues.' In - considering the policy to be adopted for suppress ing the insurrection, I have been anx ious and careiul that the inevitable con flict for the purpose shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolu tionarystruggle. I have therefore in eve ry case, thought it proper to keep the integrity of the Uniou prominent as .1 L a. - --.1 ' ine primary oujeei oi ine coiiiesi on our part, leaving nil questions which are not of vital military importance to the more deliberate action of the Leg islature. , In the exercise of my best discretit n I have adhered to the block ade of the ports held by the inrurgents instead ot putting in iorce oy procla mation the law of Congress enacted at the late session for closing those ports. So also obeying the dictates ot pru dence, as well as the obligations of laws; instead of transcending, I have adhered to the act ot vJongress to con fiscate property used for -insurrectionary purposes. If a new law npon the same subject shall be proposed, its pro priety will bo duly considered. ' The Union must be preserved, and hence, all indispensible-means must be em nloved., We should not bei in haste to determine that radical and extreauio measures, which niay reach the loyal as well as the disloyal, are iudispensi- ble. The inaugural address tit the be- gining of the administrationand the message to congress at the late special session, were both plainly devoted to the domestic controversy ont'ot which the insurrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing wow occurs t add or subtract to or from the princi ples or general purposes stated and ex pressed in those documents. The'last ray of hope for preserving the ' Union penceably expired with the assult upon Fort Sumpter, and A general review of what has occurred since may not be unprofitable. . VVhat whs painfully un certain t hen is much belter defined and more distinct and the ' progress of events is plainly in the right direction The insurgents claimed a strong sup port from North of Mason and Iixon's line, and the friends ot the Union were not tree from apprehension on thnt point. This however was soon set tled definitely and on tho right side. South of the line noble little Delaware Jed off right from the first, Maryland was made to seem against the Union, and our soldiers w ere assailed, bridges weie burned and railroad 1 wete torn up within her limits, and we were many days at one tune without the ability to bring a single regiment over her soil to t r I ha rn mtm rV -nir l tif if ! riu nrwlf to the capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and opened to the Government, She already gives regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy, and her people at a regular election, have sustained tbo cause of the Union by a larger majori ty and a larger aggregate vote than they ever before gave to any candidate on any question. Kentucky, too, tor some time in doubt, is novr decidedly, uid, I think, uneuanpebly ranged on the side of the Union. Missouri is comparatively quiet, and, I believe, eimnot aoiii be overrun by uie insurrectionist)!, l uee mree Mutes, ot Mary lund. Keutuckv and Missouri, neither of which would pvomige a single soldier at first, have now on aggregate ol not less tliftti lortv thousand in the noid for the Union, while of their citizens cersumly unt more than a third of that nuiube, and they of doubtful whereabouts and doubtful existence, arc iu arms against it. After a some what bloody strncile of months, winter closes on the Union people of Western Virginia leaving tnem musters oi tneir own country. An msur geut force of about !,3001br mouths denominating the narrow peninsular teirion constituting the counties of Accomac aud Northampton, and known as the eastern shore of Virginia, together who some contiguous parts or Maryland, Dave laid down their arms, and the people have renewed their allegiance and accepted the protection of the old Hag. This leaves no armed insurgents north of the Potomac, jior east of the Chesepeake. Al so we have obruined a footing at each of the iso lated points on the southern cooRt of Ilatteras, Port Royal. Tybee Island, near' Savannah, and Ship Island, and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements in bchaU of the Union in North (Jnroliua and Tennessee. These things demonstrate that the couse of the Union is advaucintsteadily soutwaid. Rinca vtinr last adjournment t.ient. flenl Rcott has retired from thehead of the army. During ins long lire rne nation nas not oeen nnminumt ot liis merit, vet on calling to mind now taitiitullv and brilliantly he hns served the country from a time far back in our history when few of tho now living had been born, and theuceforward continu ally, I cannot but think we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for your consideration what further mark of recognition is due to him and to ourselves os a cruteful neonle. With the retire ment of Genernmcott came the Executive duty bf appointing in his si cud a gcnerul-in-cbief of the army. It is a fortunate circumstance that neither in council or country was there so far as kuown any difference of op'inion as to the proper person to be selected. The retiring chief repeatedly ex. ires.ied his judgment in favor of General JlcCU-1-an for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give ummiiiitiiis concurrence. The designation of General McClellan is, therefore, in a consider able dpfrp(. the spleption nf the eiiuntrv. as well us ol the txecu'.ive, ana nence nitre is Detter rea son to hope there wilt be given nun the conhdeuce and cordial support thus by fair implication prom ised and without which he cannot with so full efficiency serve the country. It has been said that one bad General is better iIiud two good ones, andtliesaytiigistrue.il taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though interior, than by two supoi icr ones at variance aud cross purposes with each other and the siimc is true in all joint opeiations where in those encaged cun have none but a common end in view, aud can ditler only -os to the choice of means. Ill a storm at sea, no one on bourd cun wish the ship to sink, and yd, not unfreqtient- ly all go down together, because too many will ai rect,snd no single mind can he allowed to control it livery day continues to develop mat the insur rection is largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first, principle of popular government, the rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave aud maturely consid ered public documents, as well as in the general tone of the insurgents. In those documents we find the .ibridj emcnt of the existing right of suf frage and the denial t-- the paopleuf all right to par ticipate in the St.ectinn ol public offieeis, except the legislature, boldly advocated with, labored nf eumeuts to prove that lame conuol ot the peo ple in the -government is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself is sometimes . hinted at and a possible refuge from the 1'owpr of the people.- In the present position, I could scarcely be justi fied wero X to omit rnisinn a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism, i it is not needed, nor tuting here, that a general argument should be made in favor of popular in stitutions, but there is one point, with its connec tion, not so hackneyed ns most others, to which I ask a brief attcntiuu. It is the effort to place cap ital on an equal footing with, if not above labor, in the structure of government. ,.H is presumed that labor is available only in connection with capital: that nobody labors unless somebody else owning capital, sotuchow, by the use of it, in duces him to labor. This assumed, it ia next con sidered whether it is best tbat capital should hire laborers, and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them, and drive thera te it without their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is natural!,- concluded thnt all laborers are ei ther hired laborers or what we call slaves; and further, it is assumed that whoever is ence a hired laborer is fixed iu that condition for life. Now there is no such relation between capita) and labor as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a free man being fixed for life iu the condition: of a hired laborer. Doth these assumptions are false, and aH, infer ences from them are groundless. Labor is prior to and independent of capital, i Capital is only the fruits of labor, sad could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the super ior of cupit d, aud deserves much the higher cousid-, eration. Capital has its Tights, which are as wor-1 thy of protection as any other rights; nor is it tie uied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between lubur and capital producing mu tual benefits. The error is in assuming that the whole laboring eonimuhtty exists within itbat re lation. A few men wa capital and that few avoid labor themselves, and with their capital hire or buy another few to laboi for them. A larire ma jority belong to neither class, . neither work for others or nave others working lor tuem. in most of the southern states a majority of the people of all colors are neither slaves nor masterjt, while ia the northern a large majority are neither hirers or hired. Men, with' their families, Tvivcs, sons and daughters, work for themselves un their farms, in their houses and in 'theip shops, taking the whole product to themselves, aud asking no fa ts of capital on the one band nor of hired labor ers on the other. , H is not forgotten that a con siderable number of persons mingle their own U bor with capital, that is they labor with their own hands and also buy or hire others to labor for them, but this is only a mixed it not a dhstinct clnss Xo principje stated is disturbed by the existence of this class. Again, as has -always' -been void, there is not, of necessity, any such thing as tha free hired laborer being' fixed to that 'condition for life. Many independent men .-everywhere in these States a few yours back in tlieir lives were hired laborers. The prudent, pennilcas beginner in the world labors for wanes awhile, saves a siir- J ilus with Which to buy tools or Iftnd himftelf j then abors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginwer to-help linn. This is the just and generons and prosperous sys tem, which opens the way to all-ogives hope1 to all and consequent energy and hope to all. No men living are moi e wnrtnr to he rrnstea man these who toil up from poverty, . none less ineltn ed to take or touch aught wliich they iiavi- not honestly earned. Let them beware of surrender ing a political power which they already possess;' and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advancement auaiust such as they, and te tlx new disabilities and burdens' ep- .1 -i, i.'i Ln I I-.. on tnem nil an oi uneny siiou uc iv.
