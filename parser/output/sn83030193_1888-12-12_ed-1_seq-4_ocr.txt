Here it is: f , "The social leader of the Administration, tho HL v i W tf Cabinet Minister, would hardly cort- K? ' tent to a formal intenrlow upon a subject so dell.

In HsKk falsely attributing to mo the Invention and dls- fcKP semination of slanders, even in tho guarded and K; cautious phrase which is employed, Mrs. Whit.

Hf-i It would be idle to deny that I have heard the H stories to which Mrs. Whitney alludes, and Hr? '' others much worse, which time and events atone Bjv can'verify or, disprove.

RICH ONfiS. And After the Chaplain' Prayer the XI one Dtened the Direct Tax ,1)111. (trxcuf to in woatn.'l WisniitoTOK, Dec. 11. Dr. Mllburn, tho blind chaplain of the Houso, set a lot of tho rioh men on tho floor squirming thlt morning by an indirectly administered prod. Here 1 what ho said In hi opening prayer; ' ' Wo dovoutly bless theo for tho Illustrious In stances of benovolonoo and boneflconco fur. nlshed lately to tho land by tho Puritan Daniel Hand and the Quaker Isaiah Williams. Impress on tho rich men of the country the solemn lesson that great fortunes aro a trust held for the bene, tit of their fcllow.mcn;,tliat money only be comes wealth when widely used to help others to help theroselvMI that thon only Is it llko mercy, twloo blessed, 'blessing him who gives and him who take.' Inspire the moneyed classes of this prosperous iiountry with lofty passion for the common weal, leltilng them to leant that happiness Is not to io found in hoarded wealth, not In selfish and ynlgar display, but In humbly following in the footsteps of him who oamo frrrnl heaven to teach, in life and death, byword and deed, that It is more blessed to give than to receive. " During this petition llttlo Deacon White raised his eves furtively sovcrs times and glanced over to where Dunham, of Illinois, stood in devont pono. Dnnham looked guilty, but ho passed the glanco of reproach along to J. D. Taylor, of hlo. who has the reputation of being very "well fixed." Taylor tiptoed softly down tho aisle and nudged Judge Kollcy in the ribs. Kclley nodded In acknowledgment and pointed his famous forefinger at Gen. Hpinola and Peter P.Mahonoy, of New York. Mahonoy waitcduntll tho prayer was over and then wont around with a subscription paper he happoned to have to lit tle George West, who has mado millions in paper mills. Everybody looked around for Bill flcott, but nobody could find hjm. .William Walter Phelps, too. was absent Perry Belmont would have come In for a llttlo attention had he not been on his way to Spain. ' ' Parson " McKinnoy, of New Hampshire, with professional Instinct, remarked upon the conclusion of tho prayer; This would bo a first-class time to pass around the contribution-box. That prayer would draw tacks." The vote on tho passage of the bill to pay back to tho States the direct Fax levied during tho war will taken up to-morrpw at 4 o'clock. The House talked about the bill all day to-day. Thcro is llttlo doubt that it will pass, although the op position to it has been growing rapidly within Hie past few days. It is not entirely a sectional question, becanso Mills, of Texas, is in favor of the hill and Dibbio and Elliott of South Caro lina, both spoke in favor of it to-day. South Carolina it ono of tho Southern Btates which furnished not only their own quota but a stir- 5lus. Bouth Carolina paid into tho United States 'rcasury 377,000, whereas her assessment waa only '.104,000, and tho burden had to bo borne chiefly by the two Congressional districts now represented in Congress by Messrs. Dibble and Elliott. On tho qthor hand, several Northern Demo crat and. It la said, somo Northern Republicans and all the Southern Republicans, aro opposed to the hill. Cox, of New York, and other North ern Democrats are expected to speak against it to-morrow. DuckalcWf of Pennsylvania, mado a very strong speech against it to-day. The pro posed amendment to refund the cotton tax, amounting to three times the direct tax, will bo supported by all tho Bouthornmeniber. hut without doubt it will be lost The Direct Tax bill has already passed the Stnate. There is some talk about tho probability of a Presidential veto, but nothing definite can bo learned on this point THEY WILL CAUCUS AGAIN. What Tlenoeratte llepreaentatlvra Will Probably Do About Admitting State. Wabuikoton, Dec. 1 1. A hundred arid fifteen member of the House attended tho Dcmocratlo cauoua held In the hall of tho House to-night to discuss the policy In regard to admitting Terri tories to Statehood. Representative Cox called tho caucus to order and pre sided until he wtnted to tako part in tbo discussion. Then Representative MoOreary, of Kentucky, took up tbe gavoi. The Omnibus bill now before tho House, providing for tho simultaneous admission of Dakota, Montana. Washington and New Mexico, was the text of the talk. Tho snbstanee of tho bill met with general approval, bnt a large proportion of the speakers were willing to dlvldo Dakota, admitting tho southern halt as a State and organizing tho northern half as a Territory. A E reposition of Mr. Holman to modify the Omm na bill to this extent was under consideration when tho caucus, seeing that tho dlsonsston could pot be finished in ono night, adjourned to meet again on Thursday evening. The principal speeches woro made by Dele gates Toole, of Montana, and Voorheoa, of Washington Torritory. Both would admit South Dakota and the othor three Territories men tioned in tho Omnibus bill. Other spoechos wcro mado by Cox. Splnola, McAdoo, Oaten, Ohipman, McDonald and several others. It was mads nnlto apparent that tho Omnibus bill will be modified probably so as to divide Dakota and admit tho southern half Instead of ad mitting it as a whole. S. S. Cox would admit all tho Territories by separate bills, but tho proposition did not meet with as much favor as tho urouplng plan. Toolo snggested to admit Montana and South Dakota off-hand at tho present session, they having al ready adopted constitutions, and pass an enabling act for tho othor two Tocritonos. On Thursday evening tho caucus will probably de tormlno to push tho Omnibus bill. ' Senator Vance, of North Carolina, is decidedly annoyed at the criticisms which Democrat in tho House havo mado of tho conduct of Demo cratic Bcnatora on the Senate Tariff Dill. Said ho to-day; ' Tbo criticisms of tho Way and Means Com mittee of the Houso on the Finance Committee of the Benato are very unlust Wenevar saw the Senate bill until a few days before Congress ad journed. The Senate has bean, in session four days. The analysis of the Senate bill by Treas ury experts was handed to tho Senate finance Committee pn last Wednesday morning. Tho hard work ' done by the Way and Moans Com mittee was put in the possession of Spnators this morning for the first time. To sup- SMe the Dcmocratlo members of the Finance, ommlttee capable of analyzing tho Senate bill and exposing Its provisions In four days is pay ing them a high compliment indeed, especially when wo remember tho fact that the Ways and Means Committee took only about seven months to frame their bill and pass it in tho House. If they will posses their souls in patience'! think they will find the Dcmocratlo members of the Finance Committee of the Senate adoquato to tholr duty in tho premlsos. "

With tho exception of Beflor Armljo and Seflor Gonzalez the Ministers aro men of small note and influence. Premier Sagasta has chosen them for their pliancy. The Liberals an. tlcipate that thcro will bo no attempts at genu ino progressive legislation, but rather some con cessions to tho Protectionists and tho suspension of the electoral and military reforms. Tho Min isters took tho oath of offlco to-day.

Premier Ssgasta and Beflor Morct, tho retiring Minister of the Interior, spoko In defense. Beflor Sagasta explained that the rccont crisis wa not caused by any question of principles, but was due to the belief of tome members of tha lato Cabinet that they could not rely upon tho support of a portion of tho majority. Tho new Ministry, ho said, would continue tho programme of tho former Oocniment, trusting to tho assistance of the majority. MILAN'S TOTTERINO THRONE.

Bcnator Mcrhcr ton and Payne (Dem.) voted agalnat Bonator narris' amendment making tlio rate to.O cents a pound, a In tho Mills bill. Tho ball was set rolling by Bonator Vost, who said Bonator Sherman was wrong In thinking that tho election had settled tho tariff quostlon In favor of tho Sonato hill unamended. Ho for ono didn't see It In that light, and he would offer amendments to the hill. Ho went into tho de tail of the metal schedule and referred to the Bteol Trult as "that gigantic devil-fish of a combination which puts an lmmcnso amount of money into tho pockets of its members in tho name of American labor and of Infant indus tries. " Senator Gorman said he had novcr taken an extremo vlow of tho reduetlon or Increase of du ties, but ho felt sure that ono cent a pound was duty enough for protection In the case undor consideration. In tho midst of a Presidential campaign and for political purposes tho Benato bill had been framed, its object being to rcduoa taxation principally on sugar and tobacco, and Increase the tax on other articles so as to in. crcaao unduly the profit of certain Northern manufacturing Interests; and now tho Senate was met with tho statement that the. Republican sido of the chamber would voto solidly to keep tho bill a It Is, without amendment or modifica tion. This brought Senator Allison to his feet with a disclaimer. The bill should not be put through on party lines or for party purposes, ho said. It was faulty In many respects hq know. One cent a pound would be duty enough on steel beams and ho would so amend if possible. If that was the caso, why not recommit tho hill and bring it in when it ia perfected t Senator Gorman asked. But at any rate, ho oontinuod, he wa ready to take up tho bill, consldor Its Items and volo for them if they were all right Ho could not vote for Senator Harris's amendment, because . 0 cent was too low a rate, but l . 1 cents was too high. ' Wo will go to the country again on this sub ject. " ho added, "and I hope that our side will bo able to show that protection to Amorican In dustries, to the full extent of providing for tho difference in cost of labor here and elsewhere, will bo made by this side, but that tho sharp dis tinctions advocated by tho Republicans here and elsowhero would build up monopolies away be yond anything that has ever bcon dreamed of, even during war times. " Befnro thoy got back Io the merits of tho amendment under discussion Senators had something to say about the liquor shops of Hud son County, N. J., Trusts, a bill got up for political purposos, patty capital, the Mills hill, the St. Louis Convention, tho President's message, tho Dcmocratlo Senatorial caucus, tho Democratic party, tho election, tho dynamito explosion at Chicago, tho Whiskey Trust, tho next Presidential "canvass," tho closing of the Montana copper mines, commercial devil-flshos and whatnot. When they got down to a vote on Senator Har ris's amendment tho latter wts rejected yeas, SO; nays, 20 Senator McPherson and -Payne voting nay and Senator Gorman not voting. Mr. Vost then moved to fix tho rate at one cent a pound, and tho amendment went through with, out a division. Llttlo else wa done
