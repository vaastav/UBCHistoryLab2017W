Tbe IT the fully man is has Tacoma, Wash., Dec. 4.—The Cana dian government han let a contract for the carrying of mails from Juneau, in Alaska, to Forty-Mile Creek, which is also in the territory always claimed by the United States, but which Eqgland is now asserting a claim to. It is said that for a foreign country to let a con tract for the transmission of mails in the territory of another government is something that is practically unheard of in international affairs. It would that it would only mean that the m of choose land vention and seem dominion of Canada is bound to up hold at all hazards her claim to that strip of territory extending from and taking in Juneau to the rich gold fields of the Yukon river. The contractors are Fred C. Gasch and G. F. Henry. They will leave Ju neau on their first trip to the Yukon country December 13, and expect to make a round trip every two months. The Canadian government thus exe cutes a coup d'etat in establishing com munication with the Yukon country, the United States having no postal ser vice there, and the settlers now pay private carriers a dollar per letter for carrying the mail.

In spite of all as sertions to the contrary there is not the least probability that the United States will put any obstacle in the way of a proper settlement of the Venezuelan question." The Pall Mall Gazette remarks: "So far as our relations with America are concerned, the message is not likely to raise any unpleasant questions, but we fail to see how Cleveland's definition of Monroeism applies to Venezuela." The Globe says: "There Is nothing sur prising In the fact that the Monroe doc trine talks rather largely in the message, nor in the hostile tone adopted towards England. Is not a presidential election drawing nigh?

The discussion was informal and centered on the question whether the republican senators, having a plu rality but not the majority of the sen ate, should attempt a reorganization with republican oifleers and republican chairmen of committees. It was evi dent that the prevailing feeling favored and somq strong speeches were made, notably by Senator Davis of Minnesota and Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, urg ing that there should be no combination or compromise with any element out i side the republican ranks. This ap peared to voidfe the general view of the senators, and no opposition speeches were made. The question arose, how I e Y er -," t0 whether the test ot strength should.be made by securing the com mittees or on the choice of a president pro tem. In order to present this issue Senator Hoar moved the appointment | 0 f a committee on committees, to have j republican organization to of , charge of a movement to secure com mittee reorganization on republican for a test vote on the choice of a pres lines.

Hoar and Hale withdrew their motions. The understanding was that a definite line of action would be agreed On Q n at the meeting Wednesday following a the sess i 0 n of that day. The principal reason for the with Iron | drawal of resolutions for the appoint that 1 ment of a caucus committee by the cap- chair was the discovery of the fact Iron that there was a large element in the in | caucus opposed to the selection of the committee by appointment. It is now understood that when the reason is re newed it will be antagonized by a sub Have | stitute providing for the selection of a committee by the «caucus.

REALLY IN EAANEST RUSSIA IS Will Co-Operate With Other Powers on the Turkish Question. Constantinople, Dec. 3, via Sofia Dec. 4. —It has become known today to the sur prise of the skeptic that Russia is really in accord with the-powers, and the sultan need look for no sympathy from the caar or his advisors in anything tending to thwart the determination of the powers to have order restored throughout the Turk ish empire and measures taken for the protection of the lives apd property of all Christian subjects of the sultan. This news has cast a dismal spell over Yildis Kiosk and the ministers have been in al most constant attendance upon the sultan ever since.' It is understood that the concentration of troops at Marash is about completed and an advance upon Zeltoun may be-ex pected any day. It is believed no mercy will be shown the Armenian insurgent* there, in spite of the promises to the pow ers. A feeling of panic prevails at Caea aria. All the Armenian stores are dosed and the most valuable goods removed and hidden. The Armenians as a rule are barricaded in their houses and the people here are in dread of hearing of a further and much more extensive outbreak, in spite of the precautions the government says the Turkish officiais have taken.
