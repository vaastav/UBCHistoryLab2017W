I mean na tional defense.. No one who really comprehends the Hplrlt of thu great people for whom we are appointed to speak can fall to perceive that their paHsion Is for peace, their genius best displayed In the practice of the arts of peace,. (Jreat democracies are not belligerent. They do not seek or desire war. Their thought Is of Individual liberty and of the Tree labor that supports life and the iiiicensored thought that quicken It. Compiest and dominion are not In our reckoning, or agreeable to our principles. Hut Just because wo de mand unmolested development and the undisturbed government of our own lives upon our own principles of right and liberty, we resent, from whatever quarter It may come, the ag gression we ourselves will not prac tice. We ItiHlHt upon security in prose cuting our self chosen lines of nation al development. We do more than that. Wu deuuiud It also for others. Question of Preparedness. Out of such thoughts grow all our policies. We regard war merely as a nif iins of iiHHertlng the rights of a peo ple against iiggresHlon. And wo uro as fiercely jealous of coerclvo or dic tatorial power within our own nation uh of aggresHlon from without. Wo will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as neceHsiiry In times of peace as In times of war; and we shall always see to It that our military peace establishment Is no larger than Is actually and continu ously needed fur the uses of days in which no enemies move against us. Hut we do believe In a body of free citizens ready and Hiilllclent to tako care of themselves and of the govern ments which they havo set up to serve them. Hut war has never been a mere mat ter of men and guns. It Is a thing of disciplined might. If our citizens are ever to light effectively upon a sudden sumiiTons, they must know how mod ern lighting Is done, and what to do when tho summons conies to render themselves Immediately available and Immediately effective. And the gov ernment must bo their servnnt In this matter, uiust supply them with tho training they need to tako care of themselves and of It. It Is with these ideals In mind that the plans of tho department of war for more adeiiunte national defense wore conceived which will be laid bo foro you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can bo properly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to mo the cHHentlal drat steps, and they seem to mo for the present sufficient. Larger Army Plan. They contemplate an Increaso of the standing force of the regular army from Its present strength of 6,02.1 olllcers and 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7.136 olllcers and 1.14.707 enlisted men, or Ml, M.I, all told, nil services, rank and llle, by the addition of fifty-two compnttics of const artillery, fifteen companies of engi neers, ten regiments of Infantry, four regiments of Held artillery, and four aero squadrons, besides 7f0 olllcers required for a great variety of extrn service, especially the all Important duty of training the citizen force of which 1 shall presently speak. 792 noncommissioned olllcers for serv ice In drill, recruit Ifig and the like, and the necessary quota of en listed men for the qimrtermnster corps, the hospital corps, the ord nance department, and other similar auxiliary services. These nro the ad ditions necessary to render tho rrmy adequate for Its present duties, duties which it has to perform not only upon our own continental coasts and bor ders ami at our Interior army posts, but also in the Thillpplnes, In tho Hawaiian Islands, at the Isthmus, and In Torto Hico. Hy way of milking the country ready to a; sort some part of Its real power promptly aa i upon a larger scale, should occasion arise, the plan also contemplates supplementing the army by a I'.freo of 41)0.000 disciplined citi zens, raised In increments of 133.

This It Is proposed ' t do by a process of enlistr "tit un der which the serviceable nici of tho : country would be asked to bind them selves to serve with the colors for pur pose of training for short periods throughout three years, and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional "furlough" period of three years. This force of 400,000 men would be provided with personal accoutrements as fust as enlisted ajid their equipment for tho field made ready to be sup plied at any timo.

STRIKING POINTS IN PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE The department of war contemplates an Increase of the standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5.C23 officers and 102,985 enlisted men to 7,136 officers and 134,707 enlisted men, and supplementing the army by a force of 400,000 disciplined citizens. It will be to the advantage of the country for the congress to adopt a 'comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency. The gravest threata against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. It is necessary for many weighty reasons of national efficiency and development that we should have a great merchant marine. It seems to me clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now to undertake we should pay as we go. We should be following an almost universal example of modern gov ernment If we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the Income taxes. We have been put to the test In the case of Mexico and we have stood the test. Whether we have benefited Mexico by the course we have pursued remains to be seen. Our concern for the Independence and prosperity of the states of Central and South America is not altered. which plans long matureu shall bo carried out; but It does make definite and explicit a program which has heretofore been only Implicit, held In tho minds of the two committees on naval affairs and disclosed In the do bates of tho two houses but nowhero formulated or formally adopted. It Bnems to me very dear that It will bo to the advantage of trio country for the congress to adopt a comprehen sive plan for putting the navy upon a llnnl footing of strength and effi ciency and tc press that plan to com pletion within the next five yours. We have ulwuya looked to the navy of tho country iih our first and chief lino of defense; we have always seen it to bo our manifest course of pru dence to bo strong on tho seas. Year by year wo have been creating a navy which now ranks vo.-y high Indeed 'among tho navies of tho maritime na 'Hons. Wo should now dellnltely do termlno how wo Bhall complete what we have begun, and how soon. Tho program to be laid beforo you contemplates the const ruction within flvo years of ten battleships, six bat tle cruisers, ten' scout cruisers, fifty destroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five conHt submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships, and one regular repair ship. It Is proposed that of this number we Bhall the first year provide for tho construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, threo scout cruisers, flften destroyers, flvo fleet submarines, twenty-five coast submarines, two gunboats, and one hospital ship; tho second year, two battleships, ono scout cruiser, ten de stroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, and ono fuel oil ship; the third year, two battleships, one battlo cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines, and fifteen coast submarines; the fourth year, two bat tleships, two battle cruisers, two scout .cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, ono ammunition ship, and one fuel oil ship; and the fifth year, two battle ships, one battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet sub marines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one ammunition ship, and one repair ship. More Men for the Navy. Tho secretary of the navy Is asking oIho for tho immedlato addition to the personnel of the navy of 7,500 sail ors. 1.200 apprentice seamen, and 1.500 marines. This Increase would bo sufficient to enro for tho ships which are to be completed with in tho fiscal year 191f and also for the number of men which must bo put In training to man tho ships which will be completed early in 1!18. It Is also necessary that tho number of midship men nt tho Naval academy ac Annap olis should be increased by at least three hundred If this full program should bn car rled out wo should have built or build ing In 1921. according to tho estimates of survival and standards of classifi cation followed by tho general board of the department, an effective navy consisting of 27 battleships, of tho first line. 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships of the second line, 10 armored cruis ers, 13 scout cruisers, 5 first-class cruisers. .1 second-class cruisers, 10 third class cruisers. 10S destroyers. 18 fleet submnrlnes, 157 const submarines, monitors . 20 gunboats. 4 supply ships. 15 fuel ships. 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vessels, 8 ves sels of special types, and 2 ammuni tion ships. This would be a navy fit ted to our needs and worthy of our traditions. Hut armies and Instruments of war are only part of what has to be con sidered if we nro to consider the su preme matter of national self sutllclen cv and security In all Its aspects. There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not. There Is. for example, a very pressing question of trade and shipping involved In this great problem of national adeqiacy. It is necessary for many weighty rea sons of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have a great merchant marine. It Is high time we repaired our mis take and resumed our commercial Inde pendence on the seas. Need of Merchant Marine. For It is a question of Independ ence. If other nations go to war or seek to hamper each other's com merce, our merchants. It seems, are at their mercy, to do with as they please. We must use their ships, and use them ae they determine. We h not shir enough of our own. We cannot handle our own commerce on the eess. Our independence 18 provin cial, and i ol out owa border. W re not likely to bo pertaftte to oee the aftip) or other nations In rivalry of their own trade, and are without means to extend our commerce even where the doors are wide open and our goods desired. Such a situation is not to bo endured. It Is of capital Import ance not only that the United States should bo Its own carrier on the seas and enjoy the economic Independence which only an adequate merchant ma rine would give it. but also that tho 'American hemisphere as a wholo should enjoy a like Independence and self-sufficiency. If It Is not to bo drawn Into tho tangle of European afTalrs. Without such Independence the whole question of our political unity and self determination Is very seriously .clouded and complicated Indeed. Moreover, we can develop no true or effective American policy without ships of our own not ships of war, but ships of peace, carrying goods and carrying much more; creating friend ships and rendering indispensable services to all interests on this sWa the water. Must Provide Ships. With a view to meeting these pressing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at the earliest possible moment of the present un paralleled opportunity of Unking the two Americas together In bonds of mu tual Interest and service, an oppor tunity which may never return again If we miss it now, proposals will bo made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to bo owned and directed by the govern ment Blmllar to those made to the last congress, but modified In some essen Hal particulars. 1 recommend these proposals to you for your prompt ac ceptance with the more confidenco because every month that has elapsed since the former proposals were made lias made the necessity for such action more and more manifestly Imperative. That need was then foreseen; It is now acutely felt and everywhere real ized by those for whom trade Is wait ing but who can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much in terested if! the particulars of the pro gram as I am In taking immediate ad vantage of the great opportunity which awaits us It we will but act In this emergency. The plans for the armed forces of tho nation which I have outlined, and for the general policy of adequate preparation for mobilization and de fense, involve of course very large ad ditional expenditures of money ex penditures which will considerably ex ceed the estimated revenues of the government. It is made my duty by law, whenever the estimates of ex penditure exceed the estimates of revenue, to call the attention of tho congress to tho fact and suggest any means of meeting the deficiency that it may be wise or possible for me to suggest. I am ready to believe that It would be my duty to do so in any case; and I feel particularly bound to speak of tho matter when It appears that the deficiency will arise directly out of the adoption by the congress of meas ures which I myself urge it to adopt. Allow me, therefore, to speak briefly of the present state of the treasury and of the fiscal problems which the next year will probably disclose. State of the Finances. On the thirtieth of June last there was an available balance in the gen eral fund of tho treasury of $104,170. 105.78. The total estimated receipts for tho year 1916, on the assumption that the emergency revenue measure passed by the last congress will not be extended beyond Its present limit, the thirty-first of December, 1915, and that the present duty of one cent per pound on sugar will be discontinued after the first of May, 1916, will bo $i70.3tir.."00. The balance of Juno last and these estimated revenues come, therefore, to a grand total of $774. 435.1105. 78. The total estimated dis bursements for the present fiscal year, including $25,000,000 for the Tanama canal. $12,000,000 for probable de ficiency appropriations, and $50, 000 for miscellaneous debt redemp tions, will bj $753,891,000; and the balance In the general fund of the treasury will be reduced to $20,644, C05.7S. The emergency revenue act, if continued beyond Its present time lira nation, would produce, during the half year then remaining, about $41,000, 000. The duty of one cent per pound on sugar. If continued, would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after the first of May, about $15.000 000. These two sums, amounting together to $56,000,000. if added to the revenues of the second half of the fiscal year, would yield the treasury at the end of the yrar an available balance of f 7.6i. Tl. The adjttiofial revenue) reqeired to c,rr out the rrofrem of military nd neval prepcrttb of which I bare pe, would, a at rMat estinated. V for tho fiscal year 1917. $93,800,000. Those figures, taken with the figure for tlio present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our finan cial problem for the year 1317. As 8umli:i; that the taxes Imposed by tho emergency revenue act and the pres ent duty on sugar are to be discontin ued, and that the balance at the close of the present fiscal year will be only $20,644,605.78, that tljo disbursements for the Tanama canal will again be about twenty-five millions, and that the additional expenditures for the army and navy are authorized by the congress, the deficit in the general fund of the treasury on the thirtieth of June, 1917, will be nearly two hun dred and thirty-five millions. To this sura at least fifty millions should be added to represent a safe working bal ance for the treasury, and twelve mil lions to include the usual deficiency estimates In 1917; and these additions would make a total deficit of some two hundred and ninety-seven millions. It the present taxes should be continued throughout this year and the next, l .t. 1 1 V. .. 1 t I nowever, mere wouiu ue a ubibho in the treasury of some seventy-six and a half millions at the end of the pres ent fiscal year, and a dofljlt at the end of tho next year of only some fifty millions, or, reckoning In sixty-two millions for deficiency appropriations and a safe treasury belance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some one hundred and twelve millions. Tho obvious moral of the figures is that It is a plain counsel of prudence to con tinue all of the preesnt taxes or tholr equivalents, and confine ourselves to tho problem of providing $112,000,000 of new revenue rather than $297,000, 000. New Sources of Revenue. How shall we obtain the new reve nue? It seems to me a clear dictate of prudent statesmanship and frank finance that In what we are now, I hope, to undertake, we should pay as we go. Tho people of the country are entitled to know Just what burdens of taxation they are to carry, and to know from the outset, now. The new bills should be paid by internal taxation. To what sources, then, shall we turn? This Is so peculiarly a question which tho gentlemen of the house of representatives are expected under the Constitution to propose an answer to that you will hardly expect me to do more than discuss It In very gen eral terms. We should be following an almost universal example of mod ern government if we were to draw the greater part or even the whole of the revenues we need from the In come taxes. By somewhat lowering the present limits of exemption and the figure at which the surtax shall begin to be imposed, and by Increasing, step by step throughout the present gradu ation, the surtax Itself, the Income taxes as at present apportioned would yield sums sufficient to balance the books of the treasury at the qnd of the fiscal year 1917 without any where making the burden unreason ably or oppressively heavy. The pre cise reckonings are fully and accurate ly set out In the report of the secre tary of the treasury which will bo Im mediately laid before you. And there are many additional sources of revenue which can Justly be resorted to without hampering the In dustries of the country or putting any too great cliarge upon individual Ex penditure. A one per cent tax per gallon on gasoline and naptha would yield, at the present estimated pro duction, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents per horse power on automobiles anjl Internal explosion engines, $15,000, 000; a stamp tax on bank checks, probably $18,000,000; a tax of 25 cents per ton on pig Iron, $10,000,000; a tax of 50 cents per ton on fabricated Iron and steel, probably $10,000,000. In a country of great industries like this It ought to be easy to distribute the bur dons of taxation without making them anywhere bear .oo heavily or too ex clusively upon any one set of persons or undertakings. What Is clear Is, that the industry of this generation should pay the bills of this generation. 1 have spoken to you today, gentle men, upon a single theme, the thor ough preparation of the nation to care for Its own security and to mako sure of entire freedom to play the impartial role in this hemisphere and in the world which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to It. I have had In my mind no thought of any immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations with other nations. We are at peace with all the nations of the world, and there Is reason to hope that no question in controversy between this and other governments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been and may yet turn out to be. I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against our national peace and safety have been uttered within our own borders. There are citizens of the I'nited States, I blush to admit, born under other flags but welcomed under our generous naturalization laws to the full freedom and oppor tunity of America, who havo poured Ihe poison of disloyalty Into the very arteries of our national ife; who have sought to bring the authority and good name of our government Into contempt, to destroy our industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindictive purposes to strike at them, and to debase our politics to the uses of foreign Intrigue. Their number is not great as compared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our nation has been enriched In recent generations out ot virile foreign stocks; but ft is great enough to have brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it neces lary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may be purged of their corrupt dis tempers. America never witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn into Its own citizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as sup plied some of the best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation that in a high day of old staked its very life to free Itself from every entanglement that had darkened the fortuvs of the older nations and set up a new standard here that men of such origins and such free choice of allegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the govern ment and people who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud country onoe more a hot bed of European passion. A little while ago such a thing would have seemed Incredible. Because it was incredible we made no preparation (or It. We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for It, as if we were suspicious of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! Hut tho tigly and incredible thing has actual ly come about and we are without adequate federal law to deal with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that In doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and pelf-respect of the nation. Such crea tures of passion, disloyalty, and an archy must be crushed out. They are not many, but they are Infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered Into conspiracies against the neutrality of the govern ment, they have sought to pry Into every confidential transaction of the government In order to serve Interest alien to our own. It Is possible to deal with these things very effectually. 1 need not sufgeBt the terms In which they may be dealt with. Are Disgrace to the Nation. I wish that It could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken sentiments of allegiance to the govern ments under which they were born, had been guilty of disturbing the self possession and misrepresenting the temper and principles of the country during -these days of terrible war, when it would seem that every man who was truly an American would Instinctively make it his duty and hi pride to keep the scales of Judgment even and prove himself a partisan of no nation but his own. But it cannot. There are some men among us, and many resident abroad who, though born and bred In the United States and calling themselves Americans, have so forgotten themselves and their honor as citizens as to put their passionate sympathy with one or the other side In the great European con- flict above their regard for the peace and dignity of the United States. They also preach and practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach cor ruptions of the mind and heart; but I should not speak of other without also speaking of these and expressing the evffn deeper humiliation and scorn which every self-possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them and of tho discredit they are dally bringing upon us. While we speak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her security and her effective power we must not fall Into the patent error of supposing that her real strength comes from armaments and mere safe guards of written law. What Is more important is. that the Industries and resources of the coun try should be available and ready for mobilisation. The transportation problem Is an exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from time to time of late been reason to fear that our railroads would not much longer be able to cope with It successfully, as at present equipped and co-ordained. I suggest that It would be wise to provide for a com mission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered are as serv iceable as they might be in the solu tion of the problem. It Is obviously a problem that lies at the very founda tion of our efficiency as a people. Such an inquiry ought o draw out every circumstance and opinion worth con sidering and we need to know all sides of the matter if we mean to do any thing in the field of federal legislation. Regulation of Railroads. No one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regula tion of the railways of the country by federal commission has had admirable results and has fully Justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the policy of regulation waa originally proposed. The question is not what should we undo? It Is, whether there Ib anything else we can do that would supply us with effective means, in the very process of regula tion, for bettering the conditions un der which the railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole. It seems to me that it might be the part of wisdom, therefore, before further legislation In this field Is attempted, to look at the whole problem of co-ordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion, as a guide to dealing with tho several parts of it For what we are seeking now, what In my mind is the single thought of this message, is national efficiency and security. We serve a great nation. We should serve it In the spirit of it peculiar genius. It is the genius ot common men for self-government, in dustry. Justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it lack no Instru ment, no facility or vigor of law, to make it sufficient to play It part with energy, safety and assured success. In this we are no partisans but heralds and prophet of a new age.
