MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS No Tariff Revision For the Present. NIGARAGUAN TROUBLE. Irresponsible Nations Not Pro tected by Monroe Doctrine. A DEFICIT OF $73,075,600. legislation Urged Against In junctions Without Notice. i Washington, Dec. 7. In his annual .message, read to congress. President Taft said: To the Senate and the House of Rep resentatives: The relations of the United States with all foreign governments have con tinued npon the normal basis of amity and good understanding and are very generally satisfactory. Europe. The American rights I in the fisheries on the north Atlantic coast under the fisheries article of the treaty of 1818 have been a cause of difference be tween the United States and Great Britain for nearly seventy years. The interests Involved are of great Impor tance to the American fishing industry, ' and the final settlement of the contro versy by the permanent court of ar bitration at The Hague will remove a source of constant Irritation and com plaint This is the first case involving such great international questions which has been submitted to the per manent court of arbitration at The Hague. Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser vation and protection of the far seals In the north Pacific are in progress with the governments of Great iBritain, Japan and Russia. The attitude of the governments interested leads me to hope for a satisfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome of the negotiations. The Near East. The quick transition of the govern ment of the Ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendencies to a consti tutional government with a parlia ment and with progressive modern .policies of reform and public improve ment Is one of the Important phenome na of our times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to have made further advance In Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the near east In that quarter the prestige of the United states has spread widely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There Is every reason why we should obtain greater share of the commerce of the near east since the conditions arc more favorable now than ever before. Latin America. One of the happiest events In reeent pan-American diplomacy was the pa dnc, independent settlement by the -governments of Bolivia and Peru of a (boundary difference between them, which fot some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain lm--bitterments affecting other republics less directly concerned. Our Citizens Abroad. This administration, through the de partment of state and the foreign serv ice, Is lending all proper support to legitimate and beneficial American en lerpnlsea in foreign countries, the de gree of uch support being measured ty the rational advantages to be ex rpected. A citizen himself cannot by contract or otherwise divest himself of the right, nor can this government escape the obligation, of his protec tion in bis personal and property rights when these are unjustly In fringed is a foreign country. To avoid -ceaseless vexations it Is proper that la considering Whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support- ed, in a particular country the govern 'tDent should give full weight not only ; to the national as opposed to the indi vidual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the govern ment of the country in question is In j .Its administration and in its diplomacy 'faithful to the principles of modera- I tlon, equity and Justice upon which lone depends international credit in -diplomacy as well as in finance. The Monroe Doctrine. i The pan-American policy of thin I government has long been fixed in Its principles and remains unchanged. 1 With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to 'the south of us, most of which have ejreat natural resources, stable govern ment and progressive ideals, the ap prehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be kl to have nearly disappeared, ninl uelther the doctrine as it exists uor auy ether doc trlue of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of irresponsible government, the escape of Just obligations or the lusldl ous allegation of dominating ambitious on the part of the United States. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexican soil served. 1 hope, to signalize the close and eordiul rela tions which so well bind together this republic and the great republic Imme diately to the south, between which there Is so vast a network of material interests. I am happy to say thnt all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining cose before The Hague tribunal. On July 30, 190!), the government of Fanama agreed, after considerable ne gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and sailors who were brutally treated, one of them having. Indeed, been killed by the Panaman police this year. This government was obliged to in tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nica ragua, which It had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept 18. 10O9. Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the Interests in the American claim of Alsop & Co. against the government of Chile. The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and bad prom ised this government to settle it There had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of Jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov ernments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both set such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defin itive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII. The Nicaraguan Trouble. Since the Washington conventions of 1007 were communicated to the gov ernment of the United States as a con sulting and advising party this gov ernment has been almost continuously called upon by one or another and In turn by all of the five Central Amer ican republics to exert Itself for the maintenance of the conventions. Near ly every complaint has been against the Zelaya government of Nicaragua, which has kept Central America in constant tension or turmoil. The re sponses made to the representations of Central American republics as due from the United States on account of its relation to the Washington conven tions have been at all times conserva tive and have avoided, so far as possi ble, any semblance of Interference, al though it Is very apparent that the considerations of geographic proximity to the canal zone and of the very sub stantial American Interests In Central America give to the United States a special position in the zone of these republics and the Caribbean sea. I need not rehearse here the patient efforts of this government to promote peace and welfare among these re publics, efforts which are fully appre ciated by the majority of them who are loyal to their true interests. It would be no less unnecessary to re hearse here the sad tale of unspeak able barbarities and oppression alleged to have been committed by the Zeluyu government. Recently two Americans were put to death by order of Presi dent Zelaya himself. They were offi cers in the organized forces of a rev olution which had continued many weeks and was in control of about half of the republic, and as such, ac cording to tne modern enlightened practice of civilized nations, they were entitled to be dealt with us prisoners of war. At the date when this message is printed this government has termi nated diplomatic relations with the Zelaya government for reasons made public in a communication to the for mer Nlcaraguan charge d'affaires and is Intending to take such future steps as may be found most consistent with its dignity, its duty to American In terests and Its moral obligations to Central America and to civilization. It may later be necessary for me to bring this subject to the attention of the congress in a special message. In the Far East In the far east this government pre serves unchanged its policy of support ing the principle of equality of oppor tunity and scrupulous respect for the Integrity of the Chinese empire, to which policy are pledged the Interest ed powers of both east and west By the treaty of 1903 China has un dertaken the abolition of likin with a moderate and proportionate raising of the customs tariff along with currency reform. These reforms being a mani fest advantage to foreign commerce as well as to the Interests of China, this government Is endeavoring to facili tate these measures and the needful acquiescence of the treaty powers. When it appeared that Chinese Ilkln revenues were to be hypothecated to foreign bankers in connection with a great railway project it was obvious that the governments whose nationals held this loan would have a certain direct Interest In the question of the carrying out by China of the reforms In question. The administration deem ed American participation to be of great national Interest. Happily, when -Trtir mmaammmmm It was as a matter of broud policy ur Kent that this opportunity should not be lost, the Indispensable instrumental ity presented Itself whu a group of American Imukers of liiternatinnnl reputation mid great resources agreed at once to share In the loan upon pre cisely suoh terms as this government should approve. The chief of those terms was that American railway ma terial should be upon an exact equality with that of the other nntlonnls Join ing In the loan In the placing of or ders for this whole railroad system. After months of negotiation the equal participation of Americans seems at last assured. In one of the Chinese-Japanese con ventions of Sept. 1 of this year there was a provision which cnused consid erable public npprehension In that upon Its face it was believed In, some quarters to seek to establish a monop oly of mining privileges along the South Manchurian and Antung-Muk-den railroads and thus to exclude Americans from a wide field of enter prise, to take port in which they were by treaty with China entitled. After a thorough examination of the conven tions and of the several contextual documents the secretary of state reach ed the conclusion that no such monop oly was intended or accomplished. This government made Inquiry of the imperial Chinese and Japanese gov ernments and received from each offi cial assurance that the provision bad no purpose Inconsistent with the poli cy of equality of opportunity to which the signatories, in common with thp United States, are pledged. Our traditional relations with the Japanese empire continue cordial, as usual. The arrangement of 1908 for a co-operative control of the coming of laborers to the United States has proved to work satisfactorily. The matter of a revision . of the existing treaty between the United States and Japan which is terminable in 1912 Is already receiving the study of both countries. The Department of State. I earnestly recommend to the favor able action of the congress the esti mates submitted by the department of state and most especially the legisla tion suggested In the secretary of state's letter of this date whereby it will be possible to develop and make permanent the reorganization of the department upon modern lines In a manner to make It a thoroughly ef ficient instrument in the furtherance of our foreign trade and of American Interests abroad. Under a provision of the act of Aug. 6, 1009, I have appointed three officials to assist the officers of the government in collecting Information necessary to a wise administration of the tariff act of Aug. 5, 1909. As to questions of customs administration they are co operating with the officials of the treasury department and as to matters of the needs and the exigencies of our manufacturers and exporters with the department of commerce and labor in its relation to the domestic aspect of the subject of foreign commerce. As a consequence of section 2 of the tariff act of Aug. 5, 1909, it becomes the duty of the secretary of state to con duct as diplomatic business all the negotiations necessary to place him in a position to advise me as to whether or not a particular country unduly dis criminates against the United States in the sense of the statute referred to. Government Expenditures and Rev enues. Perhaps the most Important ques tion presented to this administration is that of economy In expenditures and sufficiency of revenue. The report of the secretary shows that the ordinary expenditures for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1910, will exceed the estimated re ceipts by $34.075.U'.,0. If to this deficit are added the sum to be disbursed for the Panama canal, amounting to $38. 000.000, and 

$1.(HI0.(KX) to be paid on the public debt the delicit of ordinary receipts and expenditures will be In creased to a total deficit of $73.Ur,tU0. This deficit the secretary proposes to meet by the proceeds of bonds Issued to pay the cost of constructing the Panama canal. I approve this pro posal. The Panama Canal. The policy of paying for the con struction of the Panama canal not out of current revenue, but by bond issue, was adopted in the Spooner act of 1902, and there seems to be no good reason for departing from the princi ple by which a part at least of the burden of the cost of the canal shall fall upon our posterity, who are to enjoy it and there is all the more rea son for this view because the actual cost to date of the canal, which is now half done and which will be completed Jan. 1, 1915, shows that the cost of engineering and construction will be $297,706,000 Instead of $139,705,200, as originally estimated. In addition to engineering and "Soustrucllon. the oth er expenses. Including sanitation and government and the amount paid for the properties, the franchise and the privilege of building the canal. In crease the cost by $75,435,0110 to a total of $375,201,000. The increase in (bo cost of engineering and construc tion is due to a substantial enlarge ment of the plan of construction by widening the canal 100 feet In the Cu lebra cut and by Increasing the di mensions of the locks, to the under estimate of the quantity of the work to be done nnder the original plan and to an underestimate of the cost of la bor and materials, both of which have greatly enhanced In price since the original estimate was made. Government Economy. In order to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year I directed - the I beads of departments In the prepara- , Son of their estimates to make them j as low as possible consistent wltb lm- 1 peratlve governmental necessity. The result baa been, as I am advlstd by 1 the secretary of the treaHury, that the estimates of the expenses :tf the gov ernment for the fiscal yaar ending June 30, 1011-tliat Is, for the tie:;l fiscnl year are less by $.15.(1(1:1.1)1)11 than the" total of appropilatloiis for the current fiscal year and less by $94,000,000 thnn tile estimates for Unit year. So far as the secretary of I Ik treasury is able to fyni n judgment jih to future Income, there will he no deficit in the year ending June 30. 11)11. but a small surplus of $712,000. In the present estimates the needs of the departments and of the gov ernment bare been cut to the quick. For the purpose of securing Informa tion which may enable the executive and the legislative branches to unite In a plan for the permanent reduction oi the cost of governmental uduilnls tuition the treasury department has instituted an Investigation by one of the most skilled expert accountants In the Dnlted States. The object of the Investigation Is to devise means to In crease the average efficiency of each employee. There Is great room for Im provement toward this end, not only by the reorganization of bureaus u'ml departments and In the avoidance of duplication, but also In the treatment of the Individual employee. Under the present system It constant ly happens that two employees receive the same salary when the work of oue Is far more dllUcult and Important and exacting than that of the other. Su perior ability is not rewarded or en couraged. Civil Penslone. As the degree of efficiency In all the departments Is much lessened by the re tention of fid employees who have out lived tbelr energy and usefulness It is indispensable to any proper system of economy that provision be made so that tbelr separation from the service shall be easy and Inevitable. It Is Im possible to make such provision unless there Is adopted a plan of civil pen sions. We cannot, In view of the ad vancing prices of living, hope to save money by a reduction In the standard of salaries paid. Indeed, if any change Is made In that regard au Increase rather than a decrease will be neces sary, and the only means of economy will be' in reducing the number of employees and In obtaining a greater average of efficiency from those re tained In the service. Frauds In the Collection of Customs. I regret to refer to. the fact of the discovery of extensive frauds in the collection of the customs revenue at New York city, in which a number of the subordinate employees In the weighing and other departments were directly concerned and In which the beneficiaries were the American Sugar Refining company and others. The frauds consisted in the payment of du ty on underweights of sugar. The gov ernment has recovered from the Amer ican Sugar Refining company all that it is shown to have been defrauded of. The sum was received in full of the amount due which might have .been recovered by civil action against the beneficiary of the fraud, but there was an excess reservation in the contract of settlement by which the settlement should not Interfere with or prevent the criminal prosecution of every one who was found to be subject to the same. . Criminal prosecutions are now pro ceeding against a number' of the gov ernment officers. The treasury de partment and the department of jus tice are exerting every effort to dis cover all the wrongdoers, including the officers and employees of the compa nies who may have been privy to the fraud. It would seem to me that an Investigation of the frauds by con gress at present, pending the probing by the treasury department and the department of Justice, as proposed, might by giving immunity and other wise prove an embarrassment In se curing conviction of the guilty parties. Maximum and Minimum Clause In -. Tariff Act. Two features of the new tariff act call for special reference, in order that the maximum duty shnll becbarg ed against the Imports from a country it Is necessary that the executive shall find on the part of that country not only discriminations in its laws or the practice under tbem against the trade of tbe United States, but that the dis criminations found shall be undue that is, without good and' fair reason. No one is seeking a tariff war or u con dition in which the spirit of retaliation shall be aroused Tariff Readjustment Tbe new tariff law enables me to ap point a tariff board to assist me in con nection with the department of stute In tbe administration of the minimum und maximum clause of the act and also to assist officers of tbe government lo the administration of tbe entire law. I be lieve that the work of this board will be of prime utility and importance whenever congress shall deem it wise again to readjust the customs duties. If the facts secured by the tariff board are of such a character as to show gen erally that the rates of duties Imposed by the present tariff law are excessive under the principles of protection at described in the platform of tbe suc cessful party at the late election I shall not hesitate to Invite the atten- ' tlon of congress to this fact and to the necessity for action predicated there on. Nothing, however, baits business and Interferes with the course of pros perlty so much as the threatened revi sion of the tariff, and until tbe facte are at hand, after careful and deliber ate Investigation, upon which sticb re vision can properly be undertaken. It seems to me unwise to attempt It. War Department. ; In the Interest of Immediate econ omy I have required a ' reduction In the estimates of tbe war department for' the i-ominir fiscal year which brings tbe total estimates down to an amount fort'7-flve millions less than the corresponding estimates for last year. This could be accomplished only' by cutting off new projects and sus pending for tbe period of oue year all progress tu military matters. l'or the same reason I have directed that the army bIiiiII not be recruited up to Its present authorized strength. These measures can hardly be more than temporary, for I am sure that tbe In terests of the military establishment are seriously In need of careful con sideration by congress. The secretnry of war calls attention to a number of needed chunges In the army, In all of which I concur, but the point upon which I place most em phasis Is the need for an elimination bill providing a method by wblcb the merits of officers shall have some ef fect upon their advancement and by which the advancement of nil may he accelerated by tbe effective diminution of a definite proportion of tbe least efficient The military and naval Join, board have unanimously agreed that It would be unwise to make tbe large expendi tures which at one time were contem plated In the establishment of a naval base and station In the Philippine Is lands and have expressed their judg ment, in . wblcb I fully concur, in fa vor of making an extensive naval base at Pearl Harbor, near Honolulu, and not in the Philippines. The Navy. The return of tbe battleship fleet from Its voyage around the world In more efficient condition than when It started was a noteworthy event of In terest alike to our citizens and tbe naval authorities of the world. Tbe marked success of the ships in steam ing around tbe world in all weathers on schedule time has Increased respect for our navy and has added to our na tional prestige. It is a regrettable fact that tbe higher officers are old for the respon sibilities of the modern navy, and tbe admirals do not arrive at flag rank young enough to obtain adequate train ing in tbelr duties as flag officers. Owing to the necessity for economy in expenditures, I have directed tbe curtailment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are thirty-eight millions less than the cor responding estimates of last year, and tbe request for new naval construction Is limited to two first class battleships and one repair vessel. , The secretary of the navy has Inau gurated a tentative plan involving cer tain changes In the organization of tbe navy department including tbe navy yards, all of which have been found by tbe attorney general to be In ac cordance with law. I have approved the execution of tbe plan proposed be cause of the greater efficiency and economy it promises. Department of Justice Expedition In Legal Procedure. The deplorable delays In tbe admin istration of civil and criminal law have received the attention of committees of the American Bar association and of many state bar associations as well as tbe considered thought of judges and jurists. In my Judgment, a change In public procedure, wltb a view to re ducing Its expense to private litigants in civil cases and facilitating the dis patch of business and Dual derision In both civil and criminal cases, consti tutes the givatest ueed In our Ameri can institutions. I do not doubt for one moment that much of the lawless violence and cruelty exhibited In lynch Ings are directly due to the uncertain ties and Injustice growing out of tbe delays In trials. Judgments and the exe cutions thereof by our courts. I therefore recommend legislation providing for the appointment by the president of a commission with author ity to examine the law and equity procedure of the federal courts' of first Instance, the law of appeals from those courts to the courts of appeals and to the supreme court and the costs Imposed In such procedure upon the private litigants and upon the public treasury and make recommendation with n view to simplifying and ex pediting the procedure as far as pos sible and making It as Inexpensive as may be to tbe litigant of little means. The platform of the successful party in the last election contained the fol lowing: Injunctions Without Notice. "We believe that the rules of proce dure in the federal courts with respect to the issuance of tbe writ of injunc tlon should be more accurately defined by statute and that no Injunction or temporary restraining order should be Issued without notice. " except where irreparable injury would result from delay. In which case a speedy bearing thereafter should be granted." I recommend that In compliance with the promise thus made appropriate leg islation be adopted. Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order Issued without previous notice and op portunity by the defendaut to be beard should by force of tbe statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from tbe Issuance thereof or witbln any time less than that period which the court may tlx unless within such seven days or such less period tbe In junction or order is extended or re newed after previous notice and op portunity to be beard. Anti-trust and Interstate Commerce Laws. The jurisdiction of the general gov ernment over interstate commerce has led to the passage of tbe so called "Sherman anti-trust law" and tbe "In terstate commerce law'' and its amendments. The developments in tbe operation of those laws call for a dis cussion and some suggestions as to amendments. , These I prefer to em body In a special message. Pottoffice Department 8econd Claee Mail Matter. The deficit every year In the post-' office department largely caused by J the low rate of postage of 1 cent a pound charged on second class mall matter, which Includes not only news papers, but magazines and miscella neous periodicals. Tbe actual loss grow lug out of tbe transmission of till second class mall matter at I cent n pound amounts to about $(l3,iKHi.(iuu it year. Tbe average cost of tbe trans HT HUM!-. )ie than I i of 19(17 I matler 1 of llo 1 portation of this matter Is more than 9 cents a pound. The statistics show that second class mall constituted 63.91 per cent weight of all tbe mail and yielded only 5.19 per cent of tbe revenue. The figures given are startling ami show the payment by the government of an enormous subsidy to tbe news papers, magazines und periodicals, v great saving might be made, niiioiini ing to much more than half of the loss, by Imposing upon magazines hud peri odicals a higher rate of postage. Postal Savings Banks. I believe postal savings bunks to lm necessary In order to offer a procr Inducement to thrift and saving to u great many people of small means who do not now have banking facilities and to whom such a system would offer m opportunity' for the accumulation of capital. They will furnish a satisfactory substitute, based on sound principle and actual successful trial In nearly all the countries of tbe world, for thtt system of government guaranty of deposits now being adopted in several western states which, with deference to those who advocate It seems to me to huve In It the seeds of demoraliza tion to conservative banking and cer tain financial disaster. Ship Subsidy. Following the course of my distin guished predecessor, I earnestly rec ommend to congress the consideration and passage of a ship subsidy bill. Interior Department New Mexico and Arizona. Tbe successful party In the last elec tion in Its national platform declared in favor of tbe admission as separate states of New Mexico and Arizona and 1 recommend that legislation ap propriate to this end be adopted. Alaska. With respect to tbe territory of Alas ka, I recommend legislation wblcb shall provide for the appointment by tbe president of a governor and also of an executive council, tbe members of which shall during their term of office reside in the territory and which shall have legislative powers sufficient to enable it to give to tbe territory lo cal laws adapted to Its present growth. I strongly deprecate legislation looking to the election of a territorial legisla ture In that vast district Conservation of Natural Resources. In several oepartments there is pre sented the necessity for legislation looking to the further conservation of our national resources, and the sub ject is one of such Importance as to require a more detailed and extended discussion than can be entered upon In this communication. For that re; son I shall take an early opportunit to send a special message to congress, The White 8lave Trade. There Is urgent necessity for addi tional legislation and greater executive activity to suppress tbe recruiting of tbe ranks of prostitutes from the streams of immigration into this coun try an evil which, for want of a bet ter name, bas been called "the white slave trade." Bureau of Health, ' There seems to be no reason why n'l the bureaus and offices in tbe general government which have to do wltb tbe public health or subjects, akl thereto should not be united In a bt reau to be called tbe "bureau of pu lie health." Political Contributions. I urgently recommend to congress that a law be passed requiring tlnii candidates in elections of members tbe bouse of representatives and con mittees In charge of their candidm and campaign file in a proper office tbe United States government a still meut of tbe contributions received an of the expenditures incurred in the campaign for such elections and that similar legislation be enacted In re spect to all otber elections which are constitutionally within tbe control of congress, Conclusion. t; Speaking generally, the country Is in a high state of prosperity. There Is every reason to believe that we are on the eve of a substantial business" es panslon, and we have just garnered a harvest unexampled in the market val ue of our agricultural products. Tbe high prices which such products bring mean great prosperity for the farming community: but on tbe otber band, they mean a very considerably increas ed burden upon those classes In the community whose yearly compensation, does not expand with the improvement in business and tbe general prosperity. Various reasons are given for the blgt prices. Tbe proportionate Increase la the output of gold, which today is tbe chief medium of exchange and is in some respects a measure of value, fur nisbes a substantial explanation of at least part of the Increase In prices. The Increase in population and the more expensive mode of living of the people, which have not been accom panied by a proportionate Increase la acreage production, may furnish a fur ther reason. It is well to note that tbe increase In the cost of living is not confined to this country, but prevails the world over, and that those who would charge Increases in prices to tbe existing protective tariff must meet the fact that the rise In prices baa taken place almost wholly lo those products of the factory and farm In respect to which there bas been either no Increase in the tariff or In man instances a very considerable reduction.
