Some one- expressed fears that the ammunition might deteriorate on ac count of age, and this was used as an argument against the appropriation.

This name, which is the same as the modern Ola, or Ole, was spelt Olaf but pronounced Olav in the early Middle Ages. Now it is proposed to change the ancient spell ing to Olav, so that the crown prince of Norway may have to spell his name Olav. In this connection it may be mentioned that the Norwegians are trying to weed 'out the' silent letters from the written language. The spell ing of storting is' one instance. In the early Middle Ages thing was pro pronounced this way in Iceland. But spelt the same way, and' it is still pronounced this way in Ireland. But the Norwegians have lost the sound so exceedingly frequent in the Eng lish language, and the Norwegians do not see the use of writing th for a pure t-sound. All up-to-date authori ties write storting, Trondhjem, etc. The government proposes that a "secret fund" of $2,700 be set aside for the coming year. .The accounts of this fund are reported only to the king.

The republicans have declared em phatically that they will bury their hatchets and quit fighting for a re public against hopeless odds. A contributor to Verdens Gang sug gests that King Haakon better not belong to any secret society. King Oscar of Sweden is a Freemason—and he lost his Norwegian crown almost before he knew it, which shows that it did not do him any good in a great pinch. And a king-ought to be every body's king without any secret, oath bound obligations to a limited number of citizens. The young ladies of Trondhjem have commenced to take lessons in the most fashionable dances in order to be able to cover themselves with glory at the coronation festivities next summer. There will no doubt be more people than ever before in Trondhjem on the occasion of the coronation of King Haakon and Princess Maud next sum-' •.'*• ... .-'•?•' From the tone. of the press it is evident that it will be a wise thing for King Haakon to put on as little style as possible. The Norwegians are a democratic people,'and they will not hesitate to make fun even of their king if they think he deserves it.

They consti tuted part of the7 crew of a Sandef jord schooner which was wrecked In Davis' Strait. They were originally six men, but one of them died during their stay with the Eskimos. The others easily passed through the experience. They give the Eskimos credit for being kind and good people. Public spirited citizens of Kristianla gave a free dinner to the poor people of the city on the queen's birthday. The title of the new king is to be slmpfy '"Norges Konge" (the king of Norway.) NEW S O N A Hotel on Wheels. Receipts falling off. St Paul.—A falling off in the receipts of wheat for the year ending Aug. 31, 1905, is shown in the annual1 report of F. W. Eva, chief grain inspector, to the state railroad and warehouse com mission.

There was, however, a gain in re ceipts of coarse grain as follows: Corn, 1,080 oar loads oats, 808 car leads bar ley, 3,036 car loids or a net loss in re ceipts of all kinds of grain amounting to 6,136 car loads. gta^t It-is, perhaps, best to say that in every respecU-china, cuis ne and at tendants, the dining car service of the ^•Oriental Limited" is in keeping with the luxuriousness of the remainder of this regal train, and has won, as the dining car service has always helped to win, the title, "The Comfotable Way," for the Great Northern Rail way. The new dining car service of the "Oriental Limited" equals Jn beau ty, design and interior furnishings anything which is operated on any transcontinental line. Every luxury which a first-class hotel or club affords in the way of service is really on the dining ear of the "Oriental Limited.* ih© new dining cars were built with a special purpose in view of affording the most comfortable surroundings, as well as giving the traveler a unique and luxurious place in which to enjoy his meals. A gentleman who recently" made the jonrney to the Coast from St. Paul on the "Oriental Limited," in speakingof thedihing car service, said: "I have traveled on almost every im portant railroad in the United States, but I have yet to find one which sur passes the "Oriental Limited" in the comfort and convenience afforded the traveler. Your dining car service is excellent, the equal of any service in the country, and the superior of many. I was particularly struck with the beauty of the interior furnishings of these dining cars they are really a novelty of car architecture." The total number of car loads of prrain inspected on "arrival" at the six terminal points, Minneapolis, Duluth, St Paul, St. Cloud, New Prague and Sleepy Eye, amounted to 202,352, di vided as follows: Spring and winter wheat, 125,574 cars corn, 5,315 oats, 24,089 rye, 3,421 barley, 22,563 flax flax seed, 21,400.

Duluth.—There are now under un der contract ore shipping piers for use the coming year that will cost $3,250, 000, or five in all, and of a total ship ping capacity for at least 6,000,000 tons a season. This is a pointer as to the expecta tions of the ore roads of business in 1906. The latest of these new docks is for the Great Northern railroad, a contract which was let recently. The Duluth, Missabe& Northern is do ing more work for next year than any other Lake Superior road, and is spend ing in docks, double tracks, roiling stock, shops, hew main line, etc., not less than $4,500,000. This road will be-able in 19 )6 to move more than 10, 003,000 tons of ore with the utmost ease. Lumber Firm Appeals. S Paul—An appeal to the supreme court has been taken by the Shevlin Carpenter company in the timber tres pass suit recently brought by the state, and which the state won in the dis trict court The case was tried in Du luth, and a verdict for the state was given, on the demurrer to the com plaint in which the law is attacked. This appeal will delay the settlement of the case for a year, and as the other cases hinge on this one it will be as long before they are finished. Attorney General Young does not like the delay and announces that he will appeal to the next legislature for a hew law which will give state cases where appeals are made direct place on the calendar, instead of having to wait until the new term, as is how the case. Will Accept.

Winona The residence of Rev. Father P. J. Gallagher, pastor ot the pro-cathedral in this city was entered by burglars in the night and a small sum of money contained in his desk wss stolen. The burglars evidently were after money, as other .valuables were not disturbed. An |eatranos wai effected through a window. The lingerie waists seem more deli cate than ever, with the advance of winter, for the silk underslip worn with such a waist gives necessary warmth. The fancy now is to have the slip the color of the gown, toning an with it And we would mention at once, lest we forget such an important imatter, that a most attractive novelty jbas appeared in the way of a waist of •Spanish lace, that dear, old-fshioned Jace beloved of our mothers. Perhaps •with a little searching we may be able to unearth a scarf or shawl of this latest fashion in laces, and lucky in deed should we count ourselves if we come upon enough to make an evening waist One of the best Spanish lace ^models had for trimming folds of white velvet, the rich cream of the lace very lovely against the snowy pile of the heavier material. Gray is in highest favor, this quiet color pushed into the foreground London smoke, nickel, gull, the terms used to describe the quietest tones of the unobtrusive color—the quietest and most favored. And white, is the choice for combining with the\ gray, the result attaining what some one speaks of as "grave chic." A soft gray broadcloth of richest satin sheen, is worn with a waist of white net, and the hat a gray panne whose trimming is a single yellow rose and one white plume. The quiet elegance is charm ing, all strong contrast avoided. In" neckwear there is shown a liking for combining heavy and light materi als, a heavy lace with fins net, very pretty chemisettes come in this style, and are worn unlined. The stores offer undersleeves of net, both lined and unlined, and the short-sleeved lady, if she have enough money, may easily solve the problem of piecing but the arm covering. A cream net ap pears to be preferred, and the sleeves as a rule are not elaborately trimmed a bit of shirring of the net, the use of a row or two of lace. Of course these can be made at home satisfactorily and at small cost. A pretty negligee is indispensable In my lady's wardrobe, and the one here illustrated is simple and pretty. It is made of veiling and bordered with a rather broad band of ribbon, and cut with double handkerchief points, the sleeves formed of the upper ones. At the neck is a broad collar of heavy lace, and a large soft bow fastens the dainty garment. The ribbon may be of the washable sort, or tacked on so it can easily be removed when the sack needs washing. Through we have reached the point wintre we wonder we ever could luwe liked anything but the long, slender waist, we are called upon to contemplate very different lines, the Josephine dress with the waist way up under the arms. In the course of time we may grow ac customed to it again, but it will take some hard-effort The dressmakers say we shall have to, that the short waisted Josephines and hlgh-waisted Directoire styles are to oust the low bust and dip belts. The Empire coats hare not proved so universally popu lar as prophesied, and we think it quite posible that the Josephines and Direstoires may be classed with the other much exploited style. There are, to be sure, some very beautiful Empire gowns to be seen among evening costumes. One lovely model was ef citron-yellow panne am broldered in silver 'and bordered with a •arrow band ef dark fur. Tha short ^t^Jv^^f-wtlSSf Fashions No Most Favored
