All right, 'Lysses and Conkey, go ahead. Watch and pray I _^ The number of civil service reformers in Congress is absolutely marvelous. Every member of congress is a civil ser vice reformer, and every one has a "plan," but what is most remarkable, also, is that none of these schemes are, as a whole, of real, positive value. It is ominous to see " the tactics of congressmen whose heads have been made dizzy by the late election. It has been ascertaiued that bossism, after all, is not so powerful a factor in politics as the people. Tnnr.E is a pretty determined effort to secure the removal of S. P. Rounds, the superintendent of the government printing office at Washington, because he held Helm as an assistant. Helm will be re membered,as recently removed because he was connected with the Critic, a paper which sustains the star route thieves, and bitterly assails the administration. Ever since then Mr. Round's enemies have been endeavoring to mix him up in the matter and - demand his removal because he appointed Helm as an assistant. The Globe is pleased to an nounce that the effort has proved futile. Mr. Rounds is a most thoroughly com petent man, and the best public printer that wo have ever had. He is the best be cause he is practical in his duties and not a politician. Heretofore the position has been held by politicians, pure and simple. and now it is held, as it should be, by a practical printer. Mr. Rounds is the first public printer who has been able to keep copies of the President's message from being made public prior to its delivery to Congress. For a number of years the only way the President has been able to keep his mes sage secret has been to read it from man uscript. Mr. Rounds put half the last mes sage in type himself, and had the re mainder set in his presence by two or three trusty men. The type was then locked up in a safe and no proof sheet escaped. This feat is quite a laurel for Mr. Rounds,for it is generally understood that an advance copy of the President's message commands a large cash figure and the average weak ness of human nature makes it difficult for it to pass through the government print ing office without encountering some one • who cannot resist the temptation to secure i•. a surreptious copy. 

CLOSE OF THE RAILROAD WAR. The New York telegrams to this morn ing's G1.082 record the termination of the railroad war in the Northwest. Just what the details may be, we are not advised, but if the railroads are willing to be fair and moderate in their "mutual" arrangement, the public will be the gainer by the closing of the war. The temporary advantage which same "ndividuals may gain by such a contest of corporate capital is more tkan offset by the general financia demoralization which must necessarily en sue if the struggle is long prolonged. That demoralization will be far reaching and affect every one, while only the few, at the best, derive any benefit from the ruinous cut and slash policy. It is reasonable to presume that one good result will follow the short-lived rail road war, and that is the permanent re duction of freight and passenger rates on the trunk lines. There is no doubt that the capital invested will be handsomely remunerative at very much lower rates than those in vogue, and while the war went to the other extreme,there is a happy mean which it would be the part of wis dom for the railroad managers to adopt. For instance, while they cannot afford to carry passengers from St. Paul to Chicago for fifty cents or a dollar, they can afford to make a considerable reduction from fourteen dollars. The same applies to freight rates. The cut rates of the past few weeks will have a tendency to invoke legislation rel ative to railroad rates in general, and that is why the Globe suggests to the railroad managers that it will ... tho part of wis dom to anticipate this by striking the hap py mean. The people, in their legisla tures or any other capacity, have no right to oppress the railroads and make the capital invested therein unremunerative, and the railroads, on the other hand, have no right to oppress the people and make their labor and production unremunera tive by excessive transportation tariffs. Moderation aa:l wisdom on both . sides is demanded by both public and private in terests. A SECOND. BRIDGE DEMANDED. The prospect* of any public improve ment in St. Paul is sure to raise the ire of the immaculate Pioneer Press. It cannot bear to see the prospect of a second bridge over the river at St. Paul, because it will have a tendency to advance the city. Minneapolis has half a dozen bridges con necting the two sides of the river and (us the result, the old' St. Anthony J side, which was comparatively dead, has sprung into life, and the strides it has made in two years past, eclipse the work of the previous twenty. The P. P. Championed the Minneapolis bridges, and if more were projected it would champion them also, [because it seeks, upon every possible occasion, to advance that city and to correspondingly decry St. Paul. The people having votad to issue bonds to build a second bridge, the city council is very properly at work to locate and con struct the thoroughfare. Because they are doing this, because they are complying with the public demand, they are bitted v ienounced by the Minneapolis P.P. ;^j held up as a band of robbers and p* *,-,-' I jrous to the public interests. It has long been appa*- fc jsts of the city den*' -""■.. ...- -, , „ ... ; .*cd another bridge. x . snot claime* 1 ..--• , , . ° *.t n* .. - that a steady strep- .

Th' vi. .* side is a portion of the .  4 Westeideis a portion cf the '■. c ' J* 'can fee readily developed, if .rfC'ioiv comnranicahon is made with lh <-- bunk of th* river. It is the best aM*nost natural "ftc'a-tion for large manu uAfUuHng, and it 55 far more accessible for residences than any portion of the city adapted to people with moderate means, li. is because the population of the Sixth ward is composed of mechanics and, for raa most part, citizens of moderate moans, that the purse-proud Minneapolis P. P. so bitterly denounces them and the proposi tion to giyo them some business advan tages. It is not necessary to follow the notori ous plunderers who conduct the P. P. through the labyrinth of lies and blackguardism with which they assail the city council. These professional black mailers, who rank no better than common thieves, are certainly possessed of a vast degree of assurance when they assume to impugn the integrity of the city council, or any other body of reputable citizens. They assume for instance that Assistant City Engineer Fuller is engaged in a corner lot real estate specula tion on the West side, and that his relative, Aid. Gates A. Johnson, is a part ner in the transaction. By accident the Globe happens to know that Mr. Fuller's entire real estate interests on the West side flats consists in a one-fourth owner ship of four lots, equivalent in the aggre gate to one lot. Both he and Aid. Johnson are denounced by this venal sheet, which makes merchandise of its editorial columns, as being engaged in a gigantic real estate transaction and proposing to saddle a "half million" debt upon the city to en hance the value of one lot! The Globe has not taken the trouble to inquire relative to the tissue of lies which his Minneapolis sheet indulges in, but this one, that we happen to be aware of, can safely be set down as a sample brick of the whole. It harps on a scheme of the city council to rob the city of "half a million dollars" while tho lying scoundrels know that the sum proposed is two hundred thousand dollars, and that instead of being voted away by the council, a popular vote of the the city has authorized tho issue of the bonds and the aldermen are simply dele gates to execute the popular will as de clared at the ballot box. As to ths exact location of the new bridge the Globe has no positive opinion to express; that must be determined by engineering and navigation interests. It should be so located and constructed as not to interfere with navigation and made as moderate in cost as possible and attain the desired end. That there should be another bridge below Waba shaw street, we believe the majority of the citizens ad mit. They have so voted, and it is manifestly in the interest of the whole city, on both sides of the river, to have a second bridge. The billingsgate of con fessed rascals, who always have and always will, stand in the way of the march of im provements in St. Paul, should have no more effect than the idle wind. It will be time enough to give heed to the virtuous gasconade of the Pioneer Press, when the only place afford ed to find religious instruction is in a warm corner of Satan's dominion. At present the public look for both virtue and religion in more reputable quarters.

Tuesday the false work of the bridge across Great Dry canon, four miles west of Pecos river, on the Sunset road, and three-fourths of a mile from the end of the Southern Pacific track, fell in a solid mass, precipi tating the hands a distance of seventy five '■• feet on the rocks below. Seven men were killed outright, one more has since died, and there is little hope for the recovery of three others. The false work had been erected some time, and the weight of the material brought upon it for" the permanent bridge is supposed to have been too great to bear, and it gave way over a deep gorge, having almost perpendicular cliffs. The length of the bridge i 5.200 feet. . The dead have been buried in an adjacent cave, and two phy sicians are caring for the wounded. The disaster will delay the completion of the bridge perhaps sixty days. The boot and shoe branch of the rubber trade decided to continue the curtailment of production, the price of raw material being yet tso high. _ ; ' THE ST.

I Special Telegram to the Globe. I Chicago, Dec. 13.- -Not much trading has been done by the grain brokers to-day. The laying of the corner stone of the mag nificent new board of trade edifice has oc cupied the greater part of their attention. The condition of the markets, too, al though supposed to favor buyers, did not seem to bo conducive to very sharp com petition. Nobody is doing anything in wheat; oats keep stubbornly up: the future of provisions is too problematic. and king corn is altogether 100 unsettled to offer any inducement .to the operator outside the small inside cliques in each mar ket to invest very heavily. The bulls ho have had every confidence, apparently, in their ability to control corn for the remainder of the year, are becoming less prominent. Several ap pear to be on the other side now, and the army of little fellows are becoming tired of putting up margin after margin, and many of them have dropped thair deals and pocketed their losses. Still there are others who think the big fellows know what they are about, and bide patiently their time. It is too early yet to prophesy where corn will end the year. In the wheat pit on the board trading was ' again of a limited character and the feeling was weaker, with prices ruling a shade lower all round. The receipts were moderate and foreign news more favorable, but there was not much desire to purchase on the part of local operators, and, with fair offerings, a weak feeling was developed. The market closed quiet and %° lower for December, $£c low er for January, and %c lower for May than the closing figures on 'change yesterday. Winter is quiet and steady, and spring dull, weak, and %@,%c lower for the spec ulative grade. Flour is quiet and unchanged, with very little doing. While it lasted a very' fair speculative business was transacted in the corn pit, and the feeling developed was unsettled and weaker, ' with prices ruling lower all around. The clear, cold weather, which was favorable for the inspection of the new corn, had the effect of bringing out free speculative offerings, and prices declined lc for December and %C for January below the closing figures on 'change yesterday, while May ruled steady. Later,i:iflnenced by the falling off in the receipts aad a better speculative de mand, prices rallied, advanced %@%o above insido figures, then fluctuated, and finally closed about Jjjc lower for year, %a lower for January and }^c lower for May than the closing figures on 'change yes terday. Oats are more active and a little stronger, with a lively business in the futures and cash firm, i:i good supply and demand, steady in store but a trifle shaky for sam ple lots. Rye is in demand and firmer. Barley quiet and dull. j The offerings of hog products were free I early in the day, and prices ruled materi ally lower on all the leading articles. Dur ing the latter part of the session the feel ing was stronger, and a good portion of the decline was recovered. The shipping demand was fairly active, but largely for domestic cuts of meats. The receipts of products were moderate and shipments of i all kinds quite liberal. Foreign advices were less favorable to holders, and bacon was quoted Is lower. Eastern markets with out material change. The inquiry for pork was active and the offerings free. Prices ruled 10015 c lower early, but rallied again 5 10c and closed steady. The offerings •of lard were free, and the demand was active. Prices ruled 2% 5c lower per 100 lbs. early in the day, but rallied again and closed steady. Hogs sold 50.10 c low er, and 50,000 arrived. Owing to the business of the day closing at noon, many speculative orders were left over. More than a day's business must be transacted to-morrow, and this will have some effect on the markets. The Corner Stone. Noon was the hour set for the adjournment of the board '„ and the formation of the procession for the corner stone laying, and all seemed to be impressed with the fact that it was a great historical event. It was but natural that not only the members of the board, but citizens generally should take an inter est in the occasion, which marked an era in the commercial progress of the board and tho city. The board of trade started in a very small way, and at first made very slow progress, but to-day the institution is one to boast of. Its membership embraces some of the wealthiest and most influential men of the city, and its new building will rival any commercial ex change in " the , :. world. In 187iLthe first steps were taken toward j the erection of the structure, but it was not until July 17,"1880, that it was resolved to proceed with the work. Negotiations were opened with the representative of the Tracy estate. He agreed to sell 200 feat front provided the board would get La Salle street vacated and erect a building on the lot. The committee accepted the terms, and this apt was ratified by the board. But as soon as an effort was made to close up the street there was trouble, and to save time Messrs. John R. Beusley, ' P. D. Armour and S. E. Kent bought up the < whole block and sold the board 210x173 ]; feet, and after much litigation, got the I street closed. The building will cost over $1,000,000. I The walls will be built of Fox Island gran : ite, costing $335,000 delivered and set in ] the walls. The building will contain an 1 immons' " ~ " boa-" -** exchange, or trading hall for the j -'-- '-d that will be over twice as large as the l present hall, and also 120 offices for rental, I Then there will be a call board, committee rooms, etc. It will be 170 feet, '.) inches, by 100 feet in depth, with an office building to the south 170 feet, 9 inches, by 65 feet in depth. The main facade will front LaSalle street, with a tower in the center 32 feet wide, rising 240 feet. This tower, ornamented by vari ous cornices, is capped by a pinacle 40 feet in height, around the base of which riliis a balcony, and i? surmounted by a statue of Heronry* The two "corners "on LaSalle street will be topped with pavilions 22 fee square. On each side of the new building will be a tablet 56 feet long by 28 feet high. These will be of stone, and carved upon them allegorical representations of trade, commence and the arts, nine mam. moth grarjte figures. The tablets are to be crow oc a by statues of Cares thirteen feet nigh. . These tablets will be each sup ported by two brackets of stone twenty five feet high, their base resting against stone griffins. The two southern corners will be double towers, raised slightly above the ro»f. The sides and front between the towera will be ornamented by colonades, and the entre architecture gothic. The main entrance is to front on LaSalle street, passing through the tower, and a double staircase will lead to the mam hall eight een feet above the sidewalk. This hall is to be 155 feet by . 100, with two galleries. It is to be finished in hard woods and marbles, and lighted from above, the skylights 70xS0 feet being of stained glass. The second floor will also contain the call board, 70x80 feet and the offices and committee rooms. Above this will be six stories for offices. The total floor room will comprise 23.000 square fefet, South of tho main building and j.iii.d to it will be a second building for vViices, 170-o,"' feet and nine stories ; high. The foundations of tho building i have been laid eighteen feet deep, and the entire edifice will be .fire proof. The board of real ' estate man agers expect to complete the structure by .May 1, 1884. At noon the board adjourned for the day. Several bands then entered the building and Lyon & Henley's went up on the iloor of'chtnge, where it played se viral lively airs for the bulls and bears to dance to, after which the members fell in line, four abreast. President Dunham and Sec retary Randolph headed the line, followed by the ex-presidents, board of directors, and the members. On the street General Joe Stockstoa and P. P. Oldershaw, the marshals, arranged the procession as fol lows: Platoon of Police. First Regiment Band. Company of the First Regiment I. N. G. President and Officers of the Board. Members. Members of the Open Board. Chicago Stock Exchange. ' Produce Exchange. Detachment of Second Regiment. Bands. The procession was formed on LaSalle street, and marched to Washington, thence to Dearborn, thence to Jackson,and thence to the new building. _. THE 

STONE. The corner stone was a fine piece of granite, shaped somewhat like a carpen ter's square. Its faces were highly pol ished, and measured about 7x6 feet. It weighed 12,442 pounds. A space was cut into it for the reception ©f the box. The stone was resting on blocks right above' iti'y final resting place, and was all ready to be put into position. The derricks where decorated with many large and small flags, and a temporary platform was made out of the adjoining masonry. The streets above the corner stone were crowded with people, and the Pacific hotel windows were filled with ladies. Conspic uous in one of the balconies was Clara Louise Kellogg, who staid there till the stone was in place. When the crowd had been wedged in about the center of attrac tion, President Dunham introduced Bishop Cheney, who made a prayer. The band then struck up "America," and, after that, President Dunham mount ed the stone, and briefly addressed those present. '' ri.g "'■ Secretary. Randolph and Mayor Har rison also spoke. The bracing atmosphere acted like wine upon the crowd, and they began to indulge in various capers while the corner stone was being lowered in position. A squad of operators started to jump up and down, keeping time to the music of the band, and this spirit of agitation speedily dif fused itself throughout the crowd. The sight of hundreds of men bobbing up and down in this fashion was quite ludri cious,and vastly amused the spectators. When the corner stone was being "tamped" into place, the jokers in the crowd granted in chorus eac i time the heavy wooden implement came down. The pro ceedings were also varied by loud cries for various members of the board and almost constant calls for Mayor Harrison. Trade Topics. . , i The arnual report of the chief inspector j of grain at Chicago shows that the receipts of grain during the year ending Nov. 1, j 99,300,000 bushels, have been phenomenal- j ly light, the lightest since 1877, being more ! than 25,000,000 bushels less than those of the previous year. Prominent among the causes which have combined to produce this result ■ are: First, the low prices of grain " prevaltnt since the harvesting of the new crops ow ing to the abundant yield in the European countries which compete with us in sup plying the markets of the world; second,the unusually flourishing financial condition of the Western farmers, which enables them ! to hold their grain to a much greater ; ex- j tent than formerly, for remunerative | prices; and. third, the rapid increase in the i milling capacity, and the consequent tenrl* 1 ency to ship whoat products to the seaboard, instead of the wheat itself. A Milwaukee broker , interested himself this morning in collecting the opinions of leading members of ' the j chamber of commerce as to the probable ; price of No. 2 spring wheat in this market on May 10,1853. The prices set by differ ent members ranged from 87c per bushel to $1.50. The card containing the names of the guessers and their respective gnc-ssea \ were sealed in an envelope, which will be opened on 'change on the date named, ami will no doubt cause much amusement. Two or three years ago, a similar collection of opinions was obtained in December^ and laid away until -ho following May. On being opened an average of dif- ; ferent predicted prices was struck [ and the result . wa3 found to '. be within a quarter of a cent of the actual- \ price. On another occasion, . when the < ; thing was tried, the difference between the < I real price and the average predicted pri ces was half a cent. By analogy with the ; above prices, wheat should sell next May i in the neighborhood of $1.02>£, for adding all to-day's guesses together, and dividing the amount by the number of guesses, pro duces that result. The investigation into the matter of di .viding commissions has been postponed. It will quite likely be dropped. §;*' NEW 

YORK. • ' [Special Telegram to the Globe] New Yobk, Dec. 13.—The bulls scored another success in Wall Street to-day. It seemed to be pretty generally understood the differences regarding the percentages among the roads would be adjusted, that peace would follow and old rates be re sumed. The activity has not been con fined to a few properties as heretofore, but became more general, the Omahas being the leaders. During the afternoon the preferred sold at 11G, fwhile the common touched 57%, St. Paul rose to 108* a '; Canada Southern was purchased by Van derbilt brokers, the demand carrying it above 70. One of the firm bought 10,000 shares of Western Union. The coalers shared in the advance, Lackawanna going about 2 per cent, over yesterday's figures. The temptation to realize has been great, and many have im proved the occasion, causing sharp re actions during the afternoon. The remark able rise of 16 per cent in three weeks in the Omaha stock would certainly warrant the securing of profits, The Western Union declared its usual X}.{ pet cent, quarterly dividend. Money continues easy, and there seemed I to be a fair demand for stocks at the end The affect of the railroad war, or rather of the negotiations of the men who are re sponsible for it, has been felt quite as much to-day in Wall atreet as at any time since tie war bewail. What fluctuations the street has experienced have been due to these ne gotiations. The strength of the strong opening, the activity and .-harp advance of the first hour, followed rumors that the conferring magnates were on the point of a settlement. The announcement that arrangements had been completed caused a further advance. "All the noon traders were buyers of the grangers to-day,"said a prominent broker. "The real advance, however, was caused by Vanderbilt brokers, who had large buy ing orders, especially in St. Paul. This afternoon there has been a considerable realizing by the Vanderbilt following, and Mr. Briton was credited with selling. Perhaps the sport is over for the present, as far as the Vanderbilt interest is con cerned. Short lines in some of the gran gers, notably St. Paul, were put out by brokers representing large bear operators. The general feeling is that Omaha is high enough, even if the war is settled. There has been good realization and some short selling on this idea. St. Paul has been well bought by insiders yesterday and to-d»-.y. The Vanderbilt stocks have been bought by parties having early information on the Omaha deal. Points have been give this afternoon for the purchase of the Gould stocks. The executive committee of Western Union received a very good quarterly state ment to-day. There is a great deal of cu riosity as to whether the attorney general will or will not consent to proceedings to annul the charter of the company. The general impression is that such permission will be given. Points are given to buy Missouri Pacific on reactions. St. Louis houses usually having early information on tho South westerns are advised to buy Missouri Pa cific for 108. Insiders advise doing nothing in Wabash. Negotia tions are pending which, it is said, will affect the stock very favorably or very unfavorably, as they happen to turn. An other rumor is that Gould is ready to boom the stock, and that it is a purchase. "It looks very much as if Mr. Vanderbilt would finally be obliged to buy every rail road in this country to keep up prices," said a broker. "He now has the Nickel Plato, is negotiating for the West Shore, and, if he gets the Omaha, I have no doubt some other road will be offered him or else a bloody war will ensue. That pile of governments grows steadily smaller, and it is lucky he ha 3 it to draw on. Where has it gone ... ELLIOT AND ALLEN. Tho Proposed Mauling: Match Between the Bruisers— n Fails to Come to Time. I Special Tele-rram to the Globe. ] Chicago, Dec. 13.—Tom Allen, who was to have been at "Parson" Davies' place on Randolph street between 10 and 11 o'clock this morning had not made his appear ance at 1 o'clock this afternoon at the place designated. It is rumored that Allen was somewhat intoxicated last evening and his failure to appear may perhaps be attributable to that cause. In a conver sation with Elliot this morning he said that Allen did not look nearly as healthy now as he did the last time he saw him, about fourteen-years ago, at which time Allen seconded Elliot in th© Gallagher fight. Allen said last night that he had been twenty-four hours upon the road between Pittsburgh and Chicago. Elliot this morn ing took his customary run to Union park before breakfast, after which he went to Hyde park and back. If his fight with Sxllivan takes place at Pittsburgh, as it is now thought probable, Elliot, Davis and Plaisted, Elliot's trainer.will leave for that point Monday next, returning here Christ mas day. The definite location of the < fight will not be known till to-morrow. j However, Parson Davies, Elliot's business ; manager, will give Richard K. Fox until i Saturday next to cover the money. Should Fox not do so Davies will then take \ his money down. Cincinnati's Commerce. CisCDi»Jun, Dee. 13.— forthcoming annual report of Superintendent Maxwell, lof the chamber, of commerce, shows a : marked, increase of grain business the past year. ,Tho increase in receipts of all kinds of grain is 1,780,000. The bulk of this was in wheat. A peculiarity of the wheat receipts is, that more than half of the year's receipts came during the last ten weeks of the year. Through shipments for the year have decreased. The im proved facilities for storing grain and in creased consumption by mills are the causes of the growth of local.business..--.; Wm. L.

One day Jay Hubbell, who now has a national reputation as tax gatherer of blood money, called en Gen. Tom Brady, in his office in the postoffice depart ment, in a «tate bordering on desperation. Ho explained that the congressional com mittee had raised all the money it was possible to get out of the clerks in the ex ecutive department; that they were $50, -000 short, ,-md unless it was raised Garfield would be defeated. To this Brady replied: "I have nothing to do with that. My candidate at Chicago was. Blame. He was defeated. I was among a number of Re publicans who felt sorely disappointed be cause Blame was not nominated, and Gai - field was. Why do you come to me with your troubles?" Thereupon Hubbell sat down and labored with Brady. He dwelt with emphasis upon the great probability that if tho money needed was not raised the Democrats would certainly elect Hancock. "I have exhausted every other resource," said he, "and 1 now come to you." "And you want me to raise $50,000," said Brady with that peculiar nonchalance of the man. "Yes, and as soon as possible," said Hubbeil, nervously. s "Well," said Brady, "I can raise this money. I will raise it if you will agi co to my terms. You, of course, know from wnom I shall raise it. Before I do any thing in the matter, however, I want a let ter from Gen. Garfield which will convey to me the assured fact that 'he knows I am to raise it. Garfield knows Ido not favor his administration." Hubbell then and there declared he would write the letter requested to Gen-. Garfield, and on the same day he did address a letter which called forth the reply at the beginning of the dispatch. On the day that Hubbell's letter reached Men tor, Stephen W."Dorsey, ex-senator from Arkansas, also arrived there. He sat with Gen. Garfield as he opened his mail. When Hubbell's letter was reached he handed it to Dorsy, who also read it. The first im pulse of the general was to answer it at once, indeed, he was about to proceed to do so when Dorsey said: "Areyou going to answer this letter?" "Yes," said Garfield. "I was just about to do it." "Well, if I were you" said Dorsey "I would nob write to Brady, as Hubbell sug gests, but write to Hubbell instead." General Garfield did as Dorsey j suggested, and penned the "My Dear Hub bell" letter. The motive Dorsey had in ; constraining the subsequently elected , president not to write to Brady was be - cause of his own personal hatred to Brady. During the entire presidential' campaign Dorsey and Brady did not speak to each other, and when thrown together scarcely tolerated recognition. Dorsey did not want Gen. Garfield to write to Brady, ' because ho wanted Brady to remain under the impression that he was to be over ■ shadowed in case cf Garfield's election. Until the star route prosecutions began ' they did not resume their friendly rela tions. Upon the receipt of the "My Dear , Hubbell" letter, it was taken at once to . Brady. At first he was not disposed to do anything because the letter had not \ been directed to him in person. A condi tion of action on his part was that he . should retain the letter. This was com , plied with and Brady now has it. Touch ing the $50,000, Brady did raise the money from the star route contractors, and turned it over to Jay Hubbell. As Garfield was elected, Ifiis $50,000 no doubt contributed largely to a Republican victory. m JAY 

HUBBELL was in his seat in the house to-day. He expressed himself vigorously in regard to i Ferry's fight for the Michigan senator . ship, saying all .kinds of wicked things . against Ferry himself. In an interview to-night Hnbbel charges that Ferry made i a corrupt use of federal patronage and money in securing votes in the legislature. He says Ferry is a moral imbecile, who, under a cloak of temperance principles, indulges , freely in intoxic mts. 'If," says Hubbell, "'chis man should be re-elected to the sea ate, it will result in the disruption of the Republican party in Michigan. He de nits Ferry's assertion that he issued his notorious assessment circular against the wish of the . administration, and says that he simply.followed out the instructions of the party leaders. Hubbell indulges in a good deal of strong language, and says while he has no hopes of being elected himself, he will give odds that Ferry is de feated. Ferry,., however, feels confidant that he will / ►. be . successful, and says that ha is * already, sure of . more votes in the caucus thai will be necessary for his election. Hubbell's opposition, he says,'amounts to nothing. A EEMINISCENCE OF THE VIBOINIUS. Mr. Springer this morning procured the passage of a resolution in the house direct- '. ing the payment of $25,000 from the ' Vir ginias indemnity fund to Mrs. Eliza Dunn, ' of Chicago, mother of Gen. W. A. C. Ryan, of the Virginias crew, slaughtered at San tiago de Cuba, Nov. 1, 1873.
