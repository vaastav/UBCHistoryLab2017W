Message to rese is characteristic of the distinguished occupant of the "White House. It Is full of enerpy, vim and pugnacity. He has made up his mind upon many subjects and he has taken trie public via the na? tional representatives into his con Aden/re. Hie dissertation upon lynching and Its attendant evils is rather belated, but It Is nevertheless well suited to the all Important subject. His views with reference to speedy trials lead us to believe that he Is disposed to favor legal lynchlag as was done Id the case a prisoner was srraL tried and hai ? f two hours.
