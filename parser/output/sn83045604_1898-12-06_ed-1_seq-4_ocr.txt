The message is neces sarily of considerable length. It is In teresting. but it is not on the who!** anything more than a detailed review of the state of the nation. The public will look with the moat eagerness for a disclosure of the president's plans for the government of the newly acquired territory, but it will be disappointed. Peace negotiations not being completed. It would be manifestly improper for the president to discuss plans for governing territory that has not >et been formally ceded, or the conditions of the cession ratified by the senate. In this connec tion the president sa\s: "I do rot dis< u;> at thi* time the govern ment or the futurt of the n.-w po*s«-**i ns whlrh will come to u.- - « a:- the result of the war with Spain.

WELL TAKES. In his annual report Commodore En dicott objects to the present location of the Puget sound naval station be cause it has no raiiroad connections. It is well known that several proposed lines have been surveyed down the Kit sap peninsula, any one of whinh can be built at very moderate expense. That •ome one of these lines will be con structed in the near future is certain. The government need not hesitate to g ) ahead with any desired developments b#" ause of lack of raiiroad facilities, for they will be ready when needed. Arid, wh'-n constructed, the government will have the choice of at least four indepen dent transcontinental railroads over which to ship men and freight, thus in suring reasonable rates always. At San Francisco the entire transcon- tinental business is in the firm grasp of one gigantic corporation,whose motto is to charge "a'l that the traffic will bear." This fact accounts in measure for the wonderfully rapid increase of commerce on Puget sound. The commodore inveighs against wa ter transportation, and yet barges of freight cars can be seen by hundreds in New York harbor and many other places All the freight of the Central and California Pacific railroads crosses the Sacramento river ar.d bay of San Francisco on transfer boats. In the quiet waters of Puget sound it would be just as easy to have a transfer boat for loaded cars from Seattle to Port Or chard as It is from Oakland to San Francisco, or from Benicia to Port Costa. I'uic<*t sound I» several hundred miles nmrer J«|ian and Northern China than san Francisco and Southern California. The Empress line of steamers from \ ictoria makes the trip nerons the Pacific In one-fourth less time than the Pacific Sfnil front San Francisco. As Japan, Korea and Northern Chi mi will prohahl y he the locality off naval demonstrations ffor years to come. It will he wise to have one ■a*y yard as near the scene off operations as possible.

THE SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCES TUESDAY, DECEMBER 6. 1898. is so much in love that she will sacri fice her life rather than suffer depriva tion of the object. It cannot be defend ed upon moral grounds, yet there is a sort of heroism in it. It is the same spirit which animated the Christian martyr. There, no doubt, the motive was hfgher, but it could not be more pure or more disinterested. There cer tainly could not be a more decided proof of fidelity; and if the spirits are to travel the road to the hereafter, sure ly these two may travel together to the throne where she may plead that in her sin, if suicide be sin. she wronged no one and had helped to carry out her idea of the Creator that man and woman were created for each other; that she loved this man, and that with out love her marriage to another would be a worse offense against her own soul. Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, is vio lently opposed to the annexation of the Philippines, and recently said in effect that if we permanently occupy the Philippines the downfall of the American republic will date from the aiiartnit'tration of "William McKinley. Nearly eighty-eight years ago another learned and distinguished states man from Boston made almost identically the san:e prediction concerning the effect of the annexation of the territory of Louis tana. January 14, 1811, Josiah Qulncy, of Massachusetts, speaking in the national house of representatives in opposition to the bill for the admission of Louisiana, said: "1 am compelled to declare It as my de liberate opinion that if th.s bill passes the bonds of this union are virtually dissolved; tiiat the states which compose it are frea frcrn their moral obligations, and that, as It will be the rigiit of all, so It will be the duty of some to prepare definitely for a separation, amicubiy if they can, violently if they must." Mr. Quincy further said: "This constitution never was and never can be strained to lap over all the wilder ness of the West without affecting both the rights and tiie conveniences of the real pro prietor.-. It was never constructed to form a cover for the inhabitants of the Mis souri and tie Red river country, ar.d when ever It is attempted to be stretched over them it wiil be rent asunder." Mr. Quincy also spoke of the residents of those sections in the same way that the opponents of permanent occupation cf the Philippines are now talking of the inhab itants of these Spanish colonies A century hence the citizen of the Greater United States of that time will read the gloomy predictions of Senator Hoar with the same curious interest with which we read the predictions of Josiah Quincy, made nearly a century ago, and with the same com ment: "Pessimism Is old, very old." Tt Is surprising how little enthusiasm is manifested in Germany with regard to the return of the Imperial pilgrims from the Holy Land. An attempt to concert meas ures for a public welcome in Berlin fell flat, tt veral of the newspapers calling attention to the fact that of the eight members of the committee five were court tradesmen, and two of them high police officials. An other paper explained the singular lack of public enthusiasm by the fact that the kaiser was not returning home from a cru sade, but merely from a cook's tour. The rosier of the sick coming from Ma nila brings the satisfactory assurance thai ro man from this state has yet suffered.

The Davis had Just been completed. and the Alamo had just received its new steam pipes and boilers. There is reason to believe that the Walker's accident was due to old material, but there is no way to account for the ac cident on the others. The Port-Intelligencer on Sunday morn ing made a omment upon President Hill which he very soon after justified. It said that while he was reticent as to what he intended to do, he was usually very frank about what he did not intend to do. He did not mince words when he denounced the absurd story that he was going to ex tend the Great Northern to Taeoma. Col. Roosevelt recently delivered an ad dress in which he sought Incidentally to il lustrate the expansive idea of the Ameri cana He toid of one of the Rough Riders, a man who dropped his hat overboard on the trip to Santiago. "Oh, Jim!" he said to a messmate, "I've dropped my hat in the crick." The "crick" was the Atlantic ocean. Now that the mar is practically over, the czar's peace convention should get to gether and agree upon a "continuance" of all controversies until after the Paris exposition. It would be a pity to waste all the American French that has been compiled through a war, just when we all want to go to Paris. Ex-President Cleveland has been paying a visit to the shores of Porto Rico and Cuba. He is keeping up with the time*, and does not intend to become a mossback.
