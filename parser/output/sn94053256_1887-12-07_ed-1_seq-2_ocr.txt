Have our readers, or any of them, ever taken opportunity of reading what by habit is called the Queen's speech at the opening and prorogation of the British Parliament) In reality it is the manifesto of ministers, and the chief object appears to be a concealment of legislative inten tions,, or a glorification of legislative achievements. - Relations with Foreign Powers are rejoiced in or deplored as occa sion serves; the "faithful Commons" are thanked for the liberality of money sup plies, and that is all; save, indeed, when the speech is supplemented by recommenda tions of greater rigor in dealing with the mere Irish. And to all these unsatisfac tory pronouncements meant to conceal design according to diplomatic ideal there is ever and always a marked ungram matacism that would shame the children of our Common Schools. With pride we turn to the contrast which our own "Royal Speech" furnishes Royal,in that it is the voice of the repre sentative of the people's sovereignty; and never in the history of such messages was there one presented so logical in its array of facts, so comprehensive in its calcula tions of the future, so liberal in its esti mate of home right and international du ties, in a word, so marked by all the at tributes which should dignify the ruler of a great nation, actuated by honest desire for the nation's prosperity. And yet they are not happy. Strike high, strike low, there is no pleasing them, as the flogging drum-major once observed "when a soldier victim at the triangle winced under the cat-o-nine tails. Strike high, strike low, there is no pleasing the Republicans of the old-time intolerant stripe. Keep a glut of money in the treas ury vaults and the cry would be of wealth lying in unproductive idleness. . Make proposition to scatter the hoard broadcast in the country, to redeem government ob ligations and save the vast amount paid by coupons to the bond-holders; to revive trade by a more extensive circulation of cash; to remove obstructions to our trade by a more liberal interpretation of inter national legislation; to come down, as it were, to recognition of a Tariff charge for the needs of revenue only, and on such commodities as would not interfere with the industry of our own country, and the just requital of our own workers. And then the cry is upraised: "the thin end of the wedge of free trade is forced in, and our own labor is threatened in the interests of wnen snail the prosperity or tne coun try rise in Republican view superior to the prejudices of party? "Free Trade" they cry out in horror unmindful or ignorant of what Free Trade is. , We are not Free Tra ders in the ordinary acceptation of the t9rm we would not have our markets crowded with the porducts of foreign workmen without protective measures for home industry; we would not have the cheap labor of Europe allowed fo compete with the honest workmen of this conti nent; but we would not stretch the pro tsction too far or shut out by high imposts or any imposts the raw material that would but conduce to the promotion of our in dustry or those articles of vertu and so forth, which would not only not interfere with home labor, but promote it, or at all events lead to increase the material weaith possessed by the country. But what need to argue on these points? Common sense is already convinced. Party prejudice will never yield a jot. It is suffi cient that this great ref orm is the recom mendation of a Democrat to have it de nounced as a measure of industrial de struction. The nation will, however, sur vive the false prophecies; and the message submitted to the Fiftieth Congress will stand for all time as the inauguration of a system of government favorable to our selves and just to all peoples. THE 

DEMOCRAT CRITICIZED. Of course we were prepared for criticism; criticism in social circles criticism in the public press, but we did not calculate on a private correspondence, in respect to some of our views which, declaredly, not being intended for publication we cannot reply to in detail, and to which, not hav ing time at disposal we cannot answer by letter. The writer puts his case plausibly; he is evidently a zealous adherent of the TT i . nenry ueorge movement or wnat was a movement and he strongly objects to our animadversions on that distinguished gen tleman's theories, their impracticalness and impracticability. We beg to assure our good friend, who honors us by his comments, that we did A 1 1 ( 11 11 " a not aecry or oemue ine iaea involved in the phrase "The Fatherhood of God, the . Brotherhood of Man," but merely question ed its use as the motto of a movement which however it might admit the divine Fatherhood exhibited no positive or prac tical means by which the human Brother hood could be presented. Our amateur critic may have heard,or heard of, the one time great musical entertainer, Henry Rus sell. In his repertoire was a song with the refrain: "There's a good time coming boys, But Wait a little longer." One nicht an enthusiastic . Hibernian interrupted the entertainer, saying "Mr Russell if you please." There was dead silence; when the Voice continued "We've waited long enough, sir Could you fix the time?" Now Mr George never fixed the time of his universal brotherhood. Dr MeGlynn had nota word to say as to the probable date for fulfillment of the pledge. "The platform rung with applause, but the people received no benefit until, at length and let our critic take it to heart the eyes of those most' interested m the theoretic teachings were opened to their realistic absurdity as witness the de crease of Mr George's vote this year in the City and County of New York from the vote for the Mayoralty in the year preced ing. In courtesy we notice our critic's objec tions, but we really have not time or space to consider what stands in the condition of a private anonymous letter. . If he can show us there is any of God's poor to whom a Christmas beneficence would be unacceptable, we shall share in his pride; if he point that Mr George's land and labor schemes render unnecessary the exercise of Christian charitv at Christmas time, we shall hold our peace; but with all good feel ing we would inform our correspondent that we edit the Democrat nere in our office, and do not favor an assumed ama teur editorship by proxy on. the part of outsiders.. Here is a point in the President's mes sage worthy the attention of working men: The great State paper says : "The simple and plain duty which we owe the people is to reduce taxation to the necessary expen ses of an economical operation of the gov ernment and to restore to the business of the country the money which we hold in the ' treasury through the perversion of governmental powers. These things can and should,, be done with safety to all our industries, without danger to the opportu nity for remunerative labor which our workingmen need, and with " benefit to them all our people, by cheapening their means of subsistence and increasing the measure of their comfort. The New York Star "the bright par ticular Star" in our Democratic firmament prides in the fact that the three great events of 1887 in Democratic politics have happened in the closing quarter of the year. Enumerated in chronological order they are : l. The platform of the New York Democracy adopted at the Saratoga convention. 2. The address of Speaker Carlisle at the opening of the Fiftieth Con gress. 3. The President's tax reduction message." The identity of purpose and method disclosed in these three great dec larations evinces the admirable union of the Democratic party of the country, as leaders and rank and file animated by devotion to a common faith, march on to gether to the crowning victory of 1888. The Free Trade that is Fair Trade the international relations of industry that will duly protect our labor, interests the great principle of rightful dealing the world over all find expression in one brief passage of the President's message. He writes: "The considerations which .have been presented touching our tariff 1 laws are intended only to enforce an earnest recommendation that the surplus revenues of the government be prevented by the re duction of our customs duties, and at the same time to emphasize a suggestion that in accomplishing this purpose we may dis charge a double duty to our people by granting to them a measure of relief from tariff taxation in quarters where it is most needed and from sources where it can be most fairly and justly accorded. m We have "fluttered the Volsces at Corioli." Yesterday London and the man ufacturing centres of England were in com motion aroused by the message to Congress of President Cleveland. They didn't know what to make of it, you know. The "St James Gazette" refers to the President's action as a remarkably sudden and alto gether surprising move, and in support of its criticisms of the message, quotes Lord Overstone's assertion that "the commerce of England would receive its first crushing blow when Free Trade should be adopted in the United States." That's the point; we don't want to crush England's com meree, but we want to promote our own industry, and the sooner working men in this country refuse to be influenced by the special pleadings and specious designs of capitalist advocates the better for them selves and for the country. Yes, that's it, in the England of to-day; and we are not far from being amenable to the same humiliating charges in this country. Fist and feet before mind and manners; brawn ahead of brain in esti mate and rewards. Daniel U Jueary can make tens of thousands a week by a' 'walk-as-you-please" in the arena, while the toil er for the press may starve on a pittance in the garret; and pugilists will grow rich while the penman may sink in i poverty, We read to-day that the profits of John L. Sullivan's tour are $3,000 a week. He has been loaded, moreover, with social honors, in the shape of nnmerous invitations to dinner from . lords and dukes, has been made an honorary member of the Pelican club, and is soon to spar before the Prince of Wales. The pen is mightier than the sword, but in this age a big pair of biceps are better than either. Our esteemed local contemporary, the "Republican," is evidently in the throes of a great party perturbation and scents "treasons, stratagems and spoils" in the air. It gives the report of the President's message all the adventitious aid of por tentous head lines: "Free Trade Flag'1 "President Cleveland Unfurls the Banner" "His Message a Menace to the Prosperity of the Country" "It will Elect a Republi can Next Year." As O'Connell said in the H.nghsh House of Commons in relation . to the oath of abjuration and supremacy "One part of the declaration we know to be false the other we believe to be un true." It is false that there is menace or danger to the country; it is probably un true wholly untrue that the country will elect a Republican as next President. There is no likelihood that we can foresee of Mr Cleveland changing his party color. -
