THE MEMPHIS DAILY APPBAL-PEIDAY. DECEMBER 17, 1&75. ? minus appeal Fill MAY. : : DECEMBER 17, 1875. UIIAAT ANDjTIIKiTIUItD TEltM. The la-t meiage of Prtsident Grant to congress removed all doubt that lin gered in the public mind as to bis de termination to make tbe contest for & third term. Hla intentions to force himself upon tbe Republican party have btcome eo obvious that the leaders in congress have been forced to vote in condemnation of such unworthy am bition. As announced in the Appeal yesterday, the following resolution passed congress on Wednesday last: ' That in the opinion of this house, the precedent established by Washington and other Presidents of the United States in retiring from the Presidential office after their second term, has be come, by universal concurrence, a part of our Republican system of govern ment, and that any departure from this time-honored custom would be unwise, unpatriotic, and fraught with peril to our free instilutionp." This resolution was passed by a vote of one hundred and thirty-two to eighteen, which shows that a large number of Republicans voted for It. Tbia rebuke, however, will have no effect upon the aspirations of Grant. He is obstinate, pugnacious and vain, and tbo resolution voted for by every Democrat in congress, and nearly all the Republicans, will only stimulate the President to renewed ex ertions. The Baltimore Gazette ex presses the opinion that were it still a matter of doubt whether General Grant cherished Intentions of the kind, it would be interesting to go back three and a half years in his career, and, be ginning with hiB letter accepting re nomination in 1872, trace him down through his public utterances to his last annual message. The steady steps by which he has gone forward since he ex pressed the earnest wish, in 1872, that he might turn his office over to his success or with the country at peace, "and without embarras:ing questions to threaten its future" ever hugging the secret hope to his bosom declining a renoraination " unless it should come under such circumstances as to mate it an Imperative duty," and following up that declaration by launching out into a discussion which will not be ended In his lifetime all these put together would form so com plete a chain of evidence of his ambi tious tendences that not a doubt could linger in the dullest mind. The only resource of Republicans who hate or fear Grant, therefore, is to ridicule his pre tensions, and make light of his strength. It is stoutly maintainedthat he cannot command the Eupport of a single delega tion, and that hU nomination is as im possible B3 his election would be. Con ceding that he could not carry a single white State, unites it be Iowa, on a popul&r vote, the probability of his ro nomination is none the less, A brief glance at the situation may serve to show the elements of his strength. Tbe Republicans of two representative States of tbe South, Alabama and South Caro lina, have formally declared themselves in favor of his renomination. These two States cast in the electoral college seven teen votes, and will be entitled to thirty-four delegates to the next nation al convention. With the same causes (Federal ofllce-holders) at work upon the same elements (the black) elsewhere in the qoutb, it is reasonable to count the delegates pronouncedly favorable to a third term in tbe next national conven tion, a3 follows: Ripley road, and then go toward the gulf. Will Memphis stand by and see this Important road pass by her, both going north and south, rather than raise the small amount necessary to build it through thiB coun ty? Active agents have been employed on liberal terms to secure a sufficient subscription to build the loadfroin Cairo to Clifton. While we have been talk ing about a railroad to Kansas City, Colonel Hulbert, one of the ablest rail road men in the south, has secured sub scription enough to build a narrow- gauge railroad from Kansas City to St. Louis, there to connect with the Cairo , and St. Louis road. We give the con cluding portion of the American1! arti cle, and ask for it the careful attention of our citizens, as we shall hereafter com ment upon some of tbe facts stated: We have given some Fpaoe to the proposed change In the gauge of the Cumberland and Ohio, because we believe that the future of the narrow-gauge system In Tennessee will be one of large development. Already sevrral road of this class are projected, In each of which a considerable amount of stock has been taken. TheJlemphU and Knoxvlllo, of which we recently gave an account, win ue extended through Waynesboro and Law renceburg to Pulaski, and also from Hender son station, on the Mobile and Ohio road, elghty-slx miles from Memphis, through Lexington and Centcrvllle, to Nashville. Another narrow-gauge enterprise Is the Duck river valley road, twenty-one miles of which have been gradea and bridged from Columbia to Lewlsburg, in Marshall county. Crots-tles are already delivered sufficient to prepare that portion of the road for tbe Iron. This road will soon be built to Fayettevlile, In Lincoln county, to -which place the Mem- Bnis and Knoxvllle road Is to be extended ) Pulaski. Still a third Important narrow- gauge road Is from Cairo, Illinois, through Mayfleld, Kentucky, to Paris, Tennessee. The road Is to be divided at Paris, one branch run ning through Lexington, Henderson county, to Clifton, on the Tennessee river, where it will connect with the Memphis and Knox Yl!l mad. The other branch Is to croscr the Tennessee river at or near Johnsonvllle, there

A considerable amount of stock has been subscribed to this Cairo and Tennessee Rlverroad, as It Is called, sumclent.lt is said, to build It lrom Mayfleld to Paris. It Is thought that tbe requisite amount of stock will be subscribed this winter in Cairo and St. Louis to put the road under contract from Caire to Paris, a distance of sev enty-two miles. The estimated cost of grading, bridging and cross-tlelng in Kentucky and Tennessee is twenty-live hundred collars per mile- me cost or me Cairo and St. Louis road, one hundred and forty-six miles In length, has been twenty thousand dollars ner mile.

This would swell his support to 258 votes, out of tbe 368 neceesary to a choice. New York and Pennsylvania, or any four of the remaining large States, would secure his renomination, and when the potent influence of fifty thousand office-holders, working for their bread and butter, Is cast into the scale, it muBt be evident that the odds are geatly in his favor. As the outlook is now viewed, the Republican party is hopelessly saddled with Grant. The only chance of beating him will be by the union of all the opposing factions on a single candidate, an altogether im probable turn in events with the head strong ambitions of the Mortons and Blaines and Conklinga pressing them forward for the glittering prize. Unlets all signs full, therefore, the Centennial year will witness a mighty moral con test, and conspicuous in the foreground the sublime spectacle, to quote from that truly loyal organ, the Philadelphia Prett, President Grant "with drawn uword and open constitution in front of the school-house." The Mobile Register, in very posi tive, plain and explicit terms, asserts that tbe people of Alabama do not seek to repudiate any obligation of the State, and cites as an evidence of the fact, that Eeveral times, in the recent State convention, a motion of exceedingly great merit in It6elf, looking to a forced abandonment of the roads into the hands of the bondholders, and an abrogation of the State indorsement &o illegally se cured, as has been shown above, was voted down by an almost unanimous vote. The State will adjust her indebt edness so honorably that not a creditor can complain. Whatever compromise is effected will be made with the full and free consent of the bondholders. This course will be pursued, notwith standing the fact thst the equities of the innocent purchasers of the bonds are offset by the superior equities of tbo tax-payer, whoee government was stolen from him by congress and handed over, against his majority vote, to the care ef paupers and adventurers. The men -who are prosecuting the whisky suits have descended to very dirty work In the way of abuse of the unfortunate couvlete. Neither the wives, slaters, mothers, or other kindred are B&U. The latest Instance of this is fur nished in statements in regard to the mother of the poetio Joyce, who separ ated from his father some twenty or more years ago, and who he supposed dead and to use hh own language "gone to glory." The glowingly imag. Inative chief of the whisky ring proves himself not devoid of son-like reverence and respect, for in a letter excoriating the official who dragged his mother be fore the public, he 6aya: rtIf it is abso lutely true .that my dear mother is still living, I shall take the earliest opportu nity to provide for her comfort and smooth her pathway to the tomb during the golden sunset of life." Joyce has a "good streak in him," sure. 

XAKKOW-GACGE ROADS UtTTEXXES-SEE. The Nashville American of Tuesday has an elaborate article in reference to narrow-gauge railroads in Tennessee. Tbe article was written upon the occa sion of the change of the gauge of tbe Cumberland and Ohio road, and con tains many interesting and important facts upon this subject. Tbe Cumber land and Ohio road was graded for a broad-gauge road, one hundred and thirty-one .piles in length, but the stockholders, after a full and free discus sion of the subject, determined, as a matter of economy, to change the gauge to three feet. To iron and equip;the road as a broad-gauge would require an expenditure of eighteen thousand dol lars a mile, while eight thousand dol lars a mile will be ample to iron and equip it as a three-feet gauge. This road la now under contract to Gallatin, and will be extended to meet the Memphis and Knoxvllle road. The Denver and Bio Grande road, nowrunning one hun dred and seventy-two miles, cost thir teen thousand live hundred dollars per mile, and its net earnings in 1873 were sixteen hundred and seventy-three dol lars and three cents per mile. The American argues that all roads hereafter to be built in this State and, in fact, in all the southern States must be of this gauge, because of the cheapness of their construclion and their light operating expenses. The facts stated by tbe Amerioan are of special Interest to Memphis. It seems that the people of Cairo and St Louis are about to extend the narrow-gauge road now running from St. Louis to Cairo, toward Clifton, on the Tennessee river, there to meet the Pulsuki road, and thus draw the trade of the Tenneesee river counties and of tbe counties.in the southern por tion of Middle Tennessee to St. Louis and Cairo. This road from Pulaski may also connect with the Middleton and Judge Comstock, one of Tweed's lawyers, in an interview with a New York World reporter, said: "The rascal ran away without paying me." Sad dest of all is it that Tweed didn't treat the remainderof his lawyers in the same way. Thu fact probably is, says the Chicago Tribune, that it did not occur to the Boes to get himself abducted until after the lawyers had plucked him of his stealings. Had he had money enough left to continue to buy up the best legal talent, there would have been small oc casion for his "going up-stairs to see his wife." But, being out of available funds, and, as It were, about to bo cast by his lawyers upon the tender mercies of a cold, unfeeling world, the Boss gracefully suffered himself to be kidnapped. The French eeoeranhical society has elected General Andrew A. Humphreys, chief of corps of engineers, unitea states army, a corresponding memuer. Thn archbislion of Coloene left that itv Wcvinftttinv.and is not expected to return. It is understood that he delegated his powers to a sutordinate ecclesiastic. Extensive forgeries of the names of firms in Cincinnati have Just been developed, bv which the banks of that city have been victimized, but to what extent is not yet known.

A dispatch from Concord says that a deficiency of at least thirty thousand dollars has been discovered in the college accounts of the late treasurer of Dartmouth college and B resident of the Dartmouth savings bank, aniei Blalsdell, who died last August. The family of the deceased have placed all their property at the disposal of the college to make gooa tne loss. A dispatch from San Diego says that a letter has been received by a merchant of that city from J. E. Gasklll, whose store at Campo was recently plundered by Mexican bandits, stating that tho robbers assert their Intention of attacking the place again with a sufficient force to overcome all opposition.

A dispatch from Havanna has the fol lowing: " The Voce ae Vuba. commenting on that part of the President's message which re lates to Cuba, says: 'General Grant's language seems to haye been chosen to wound the sus ceptibilities of the Spaniards.
