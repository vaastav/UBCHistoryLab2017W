THE PHILIPPINE TARIFF. EE prBLICAN LEADERS TO PREPARE A NEW BILL. WHICH MAY INCLUDE A RECIPROCITY PROVISION. Washington, Dec. 7.— A conference was held at the "War Department to-day In regard to the pti"PP ilie tariff legislation made necessary by tie recent Supreme Court decision. Secretary o ct. Senators Lodge and Platt. of Connecticut, and Representatives Payne and Dalzell, were present. The conference, lasted nearly two amirs- Senator Spooner also called at the War department, and talked with Secretary Root about Philippine tariff legislation. It appear 3 that the problem presented is not 50 simple as was supposed when it was thought tll »t a Joint resolution could be put through Cczgress within a few days to continue prac tJcaSJ" the existing tariff rates. Some members gjjbe-Ways and Means Committee see difficulties Oi rt C cut of the existence of an export tax a *5e Islands, and much apprehension is felt jjgtihe issue may be a party one. with the re fn'zd causing a bitter struggle, at least in the seaate. IX not in the House, before satisfactory legislation can be secured. It is expected that, tXer hearing from all the leaders. Secretary Boot ■"".:: be able to perfect a plan of action by Tuesday, when the House meets again. la the conference Secretary Root took advan tage of the opportunity to talk freely with his visitors about the pressing needs of Cuba and nr g-e early action on legislation along the line recommended in his annual report. A movement is on foot among the Republican oesbers of the Ways and Means Committee to Incorporate a reciprocity feature in the forth codn? Philippine tariff bill. As roughly out lined i" the informal talks among members of the committee, this provision would recite that when the Philippine commissioners reduce the doty on certain articles. Including American tex tiles and various goods easily marketable in the Philippines, the President shall by proclamation grant stated reductions of duty on Philippine csgar and other products shipped to this coun try. This reciprocity provision would be along tie lines of that in the Dingley act, whereby President McKinley. by proclamation, made tariff reductions on a limited number of articles •without the formality of a treaty. A reciprocity provision on the foregoing lines was discussed at the meeting of Republican members of the committee fast Friday after noon and received favorable consideration, al though action was deferred until the reassem bling cf the Republican members on Monday. Chairman Payne will probably call a meeting of the full committee on Tuesday, by which time the Republican draft of a Philippine bill may be ready.

QUESTIONS PUT TO HIM IN A LIBEL, PC IT— COUNSEL THREATEN CON TEMPT PROCEEDINGS. Washington, Dec. 7. — There was an interesting and unusual proceeding to-day in the State De partment, when attorneys representing parties to a New-York lawsuit sought to compel the testimony of Secretary Hay. The case was an action for libel brought against a New- York newspaper by Carl Fischer Harden, a Danish banker, of New-York, and in it is involved Captain Dirkfield Christmas. These persons were said to be interested as agents in the attempt to sell the Danish West Indian Isl ands to the United States, and the publication which forms the basis of the libel suit is said to have reflected on their competency. Some days ago Secretary Hay had notice that his testimony had been called for by the defence before the New-York State Court, and this morning Clar ence J. Bheam. counsel for the newspaper in ques tion, appeared at the Slat* 1 Department with United States Commissioner Frank Blackstone, of this city, and a stenographer. Robertson Honey, of Xew-York. appeared as counsel for Mr. Hansen. They were received by Secretary Hay in the diplo matic room, the Secretary being accompanied by Judge Penfield. solicitor of the State Department, as his counsel. The examination did not last long— in fact, there was no examination in substance. The counsel for the newspaper attempted to put some questions touching the negotiations that had occurred be tween Secretary Hay and the Danish agents in KM-J9M. The Secretary flatly refused to answer, and through Judge Ptnfield announced his reason for so doing to be that he bad no person*^ knowl edge of the matters at issue. Whatever knowl edge he possessed had been acquired in his capacity of Secretary of State, and not as an individual. Moreover, the information sought to be elicited was a privileged communication to the Government of the United States, and to make this public would be highly prejudicial to the interest! of the country. Having formally noted the Secretary's refusal and the character of his answer, the commissioner end counsel withdrew. It is their purpose to state the facts to th* New-Ycrk State Court, with a view to huving the Secretary of State brought before that court on a charge cf contempt. It appears that the same parties have examined, or sought to examine. Senator Lodge and Admiral Bradford, chief of the equipr-.ent bureau of the Naw Department, who has h';>3 much to do with the negotiations looking to the acquisition of coal ing stations by the United States Government. It Is gathered that neither of th<=s*> witnesses gave any teptimor.y material to the suit. Senator Lodge, it is ■aid never having heard of Mr. Hansen. and Ad rrlrai Bradford being acquainted with none of the facts sought to be developed by the defence as bearing on the alleged libel. Secretary- Hay has had little to do with the par ties in this rase. He saw Captain Christmas for about five minutes on the occasion of the officer's 1 visit to Washington, but Mr. Hansen he does not know. The officials of the State Department frel secure in their position in resistance to the court's order, finding strong precedent for it In a contro versy that arose between President Jefferson and Chief Justice Marshall over a similar application for a mandamus.

THE RECORDER FINES A NVMBER OF THEM AND REBCKES THEM IN SCATHING WORDS. Recorder Goff yesterday listened to excuses from about five hundred delinquent jurors who have from time to time in a period covering many months failed to answer summonses to serve in criminal courts. The cases have multiplied so that there were 836 notices sent out calling for explanations. The five hundred who appeared came in answer to these no tices. The courtroom was filled nearly all day, and the examination of the men who had made affi davits explaining or attempting to explain their absence from court was kept up steadily. About seventy-five of the talesmen wen- fined, a few of th*=m $lflu, a number $50 and the majority J25. About three-fifths of the men who were excused told the Recorder that they were in Europe when tne jury summonses were sent, and thai they did not receive the notice The examination of the men ■as conducted by Assistant Corporation Counsel Kiernan. Mlllard and Johnson. The Recorder became wro:h at some of the lame excuses tendered. These are some of the things he said: "I ought to send your case to the grand Jury." "You have deliberately made a false affidavit, and are certainly open to an indictment for perjury." "If you were a good citizen you would not shirk thi« sacred duty." "In my opinion, you should be. forred to perform jury duty after you have paid this fine." "Because you don't do your duty, justice often ■miscarri-'s. Then you criticise the judiciary."

Fall River, Mass , Dec. 7 (Special).— Local brokers report that the sales in the cloth market are esti mated to be between 250.000 and 300,000 pieces in the week, the bulk of which were odd goods. A small amount of regulars were sold at the full price of 3 cents. Wide goods have been advanced in the week, and some makes have been disposed of at an advance over the 3-cent basis. The cloth market ha-s gained materially in strength in the week, the cotton crop statement of the government re porting a lower maximum estimate of the cotton crop than was amiripated. being an important con tributory feature. The reduction in the estimate makes high priced cotton a certainty, and it seems to be just as certain that print cloth prices based or. low priced cotton must move in an upward ol rection While manufacturers think that the con dition of the market was such that It could have been well sustained without the influence of the lower crop estimate, they believe that it has re moved what little hope there was on the part or buyers for price concessions. Ail weak spots have heen eliminated from the market, and buyers who endeavored to secure this week price concessions mads last week were unsuccessful as a result. While th^ total sales were the largest In weeks, the trading was somewhat limited in amount, some buyers preferring to again assume a walling attl : rude fearing that heavy purchasing now wouua favor general increases in all varieties of clotne. The market closed strong and falriy active at 3 cents for regulars and above that bails ror oaam. THE IT>EAL CWRISTMA.S GIFT THE RULING PASSION " I am the Keeper of the Light." aii Tubtuhers or CHARLES SCRJBNER/S SONS, New York ASPHALT MONOPOLY DENIED. COUNSEL SAYS OTHER COMPANIES CAN* BID AGAINST THE NATIONAL FOR CITY WORK. De Lancey Nicoll. who is counsel for th« V» tlona! Aspftalt Company, said yesterday that his at tention had been called to statements recently printed In several of the newspapers of the city which wers calculated to do great injustice to the company. He l6sued the following statement, which he said he waa prepared to prove correct in every particular: The charge is made and constantly repeated that the National Asphalt Company commands a monopoly of asphalt paving in the city of New- York, and that that monopoly Is secured to it by the present specifications In the Depart of Highways. Although this statement has been reit erated bo often that many people no doubt believe it. it is wholly without foundation. To begin with, neither the National Asphalt Company nor any company controlling one or more kinds of asphalt has any monopoly of the asphalt paving work in the city of New-York. As the New- York specifi cations stand to-day they admit ell asphalts which, when refined, possess 65 per cent bitumen, quite Irrespective of the place from which they come. Pavements may be laid with asphalts from Cali fornia, from Utah, from Texas, from Mexico, from Cuba, from the lake In Trinidad, from the land asphalt in Trinidad, from asphalt in Ber raudes or from any other part of Venezuela. Not only that, but during the last few years, and espe cially during th» last year, a large amount of asphalt paving in the city of New- York has been done with a?phalts over which neither the National Asphalt Company nor any of its subsidiary com panies has any control. A great amount of work has •■r. done in the last few years by the Uvalde company, which controls the Texas asphalts. An other large amount of work has been done by a company controlling land asphalt from Trinidad. I think that Mexican asphalt has also been laid by some of the companies having' no relation to the National Asphalt Company. These facts, which are easily established, ought to dispose- of the charge that there is any monop oly of asphalt paving in the city of New- York en- Joyed by the National Asphalt Company. The only restriction upon the use of any as phalt for "paving in the streets of New- York is this: That no asphalt can be laid in th« city of New-York unless it has had a two years' trial in some other city or village and is certified by the authorities of such municipality. It la true that this prevents any new and untried asphalt from being laid In the city of New- York, but the policy of all administrations has been that New-York was not th* place in which to make experiments. It has« also been recently published that th© pres ent specifications contain provisions which secure a monopoly of paving for my clients, the National Asphalt Company. There is not a word of truth In this charge. The present specifications are cub- Ftantl..l!y the same as they were under the ad ministration of Mayor Strong. There has been no material change. I notice that it Is said in the Brooklyn suit, and repeated in some newspapers. that there have been some recent changes which are calculated to prevent competition. Unless such statements are wilfully made they are the result of a very superficial investigation. The Fit'th-ave. specifications used during Mayor Strong's admin istration contained this provision: "Any bidder offering a material not heretofore used In this city must file, in addition to the fore going requirements, a statement showing some other locality where such pavement has been laid. its area, and a certificate from the chief municipal officer having charge of such work In the city or cities where such pavement has been laid, showing that the pavement has been in use at least two years and is satisfactory." The only amendment made in this provision is In the Interest of bidders. The specifications now read that any bidder who has done ten thousand yards of work in another municipality may be ad mitted, but under the old specifications, even if he had done a hundred thousand yards of work his bid might be rejected In the discretion of the com missioner. It is also said that the provision with regard to the. deposit of samples four days before the time of making the bid Is new. This is also a mistake. The Flfth-ave. specifications, under Mayor Strong. contain precisely the same requirements. It is also said that there is scmethlng new In the prevision requiring the bidder to make a statement of the location and capacity in square yards a day of the works or factory where the paving material Is prepared. This clause was in the former specifi- ! cations in precisely the same words. If anything, the specifications have been liberal ized by the present administration — certainly not restricted. The view of my clients is that they are so liberal now that there is great danger of inferior asphalts being used in the city of New- York, and inferior pavements being laid. The ex perience of Eighth-aye.. which was laid with an in ferior asphalt and cost the city $300,000 to repair, is very likely to. be repeated. A good deal has been said recently to th? effect that the price paid a yard for asphalt by the city of New-York is higher than it is in other cities: but it must always be so, because the streets of New- York are used and travelled many times as much as the streets in any other city. Repairs at the cost of the company laving the pavement have to be made every y> ar. and, as a matter of fact, there is little profit in paving the streets where the high prices are obtained. The companies are under a bond to keep the streets in repair for fifteen years and the annual cost a yard of repairing adds up so that there is a very small margin of profit left. I think the annual cost of repairing Broadway will be over 40 cents a yard for fifteen years. People who are disturbed by the prices paid for asphalt in New- York ought to go to Chicago, where miles of streets were laid with an Inferior asphalt at a low price. The streets soon cracked and became full of holes, and the city was put to an enor mous expense for repairing. 

BTL.Z. UNDER WHICH ELEVATED ROADS IN PARK ROW WERE PLANNED MAT BE lOID. Opponents of the plans submitted by John L. Shea to. the Board of Estimate and Apportionment for elevated roads in Park Row and Centre-st. . to connect with the Brooklyn Bridge, said yesterday that the McCarren law, under which the plans were drawn, was unconstitutional According to Sec tion 16, Article 111. of the State constitution: No private or local biii which may be passed by the legislature shall embrace more than one sub ject, and that shall be expressed in the title. In the McCarren law two subjects are embraced, the extension of the terminal facilities of the bridge and franchises for elevated roads to connect with the terminal. The Board of Estimate probably will not be able to agree upon the pians, and one mem ber of the board is said to be prepared to oppose a motion to approve the plans on the ground that the act is unconstitutional.

Commlsaiorier of Water Sup- : ply and of Ramapo fame, showa in yesterday's "City Record" that he belongs to the all-star cast of Tammany .salary raising- Santa Clauses. The times never are hard In ilr. Dalton's of fice Almost any one wanting an advance in wages as a Christmas present can have it by making the proper application to Santa Claus Dalton. With three weeks of official activity left and vitta several thousand dollars of his appropriation unexpended. Mr. Dalton is look ing about to see wbara he can do people good. Here is one of Mr. Dalton's Christmas presents: Inspector of waste wat«r (name not given) from $4 a day to $1,200 per annum. While working «it $4 a day this inspector of waste water couid draw pay only for time actually put in, but at $l.'JuO per annum he gets paid whether there is any work for him to do or not, and he cannot be removed except upon charges duly sustained. Looking around some more Mr. Dalton changed the pay of two inspectors of meters from $3 5O a day to $1,100 per annum; fourteen inspectors of meters from $3 a day to ll.OGu per annum; four inspectors of waste water from S3 a day to $1,000 per annum, and eight in spectors of water supply to shipping from $'2 a day to $I.ouO per annum. Going down the line Mr. Dalton found some more good Tammany men wa'ting tc "grab off" a Christmas present, and he promoted one pip* calker to a tapper's place, and increased his pay from $3 a day to 51.2U0 per annum; also promoted one teamster to tapper, and increased his pay from $2 ">O a day to f 1.200 per annum. No names are given, as the law usually requires in such cases, but Mr. Dalton apparently takes It for granted that no one will object to his running a private Christmas tree at the ex pense of the taxpayers of the city. In all cases like the foregoing, laborers work ing at so much a day are paid for the time they work, and for no more — or at least that is the supposition. Even if their services are not needed, it will be extremely difficult to get these men off the payroll, now that they are on a regular yearly MJary.
