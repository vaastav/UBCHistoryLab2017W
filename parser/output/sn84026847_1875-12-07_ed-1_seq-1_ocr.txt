In regard to representation from tin d-M di.-lriet ot New York, I ho Clerk reminded the House that the person tirsl elected had died, and the person electee to till the vacancy had presented credentials .-o peculiar in form that thn Clcrl preferred t-> submit the question to tin House. In reference to the Louisiana delegation the Clerk said he had received tw< .-els ??f certificates for the first four ditriets, both sets indicating the election o the sutne persons; that as to the tilth dis triet he had received two certificates,nn< signed Win.

"What is known as the iron cla | oath was the form administered; to th [, W. VA., 

TUESDAY members unable to take that oath, the modified oath was administered. j Mr. Wood, of New York, objected to | Morey, of Louisiana, and Mr. Garfield | to Goode, of Virginia. Therefore these ! I gentlemen were not permitted to qualify, j Subsequently Mr. Wood offered a resolu- j ! tion referring the credentials of Morey j and Spencer to the Committee on Klec- i | lions, with instructions to report which ' 1 of them is entitled to a seat. He said ho I did not propose to raise the question ; as to who was the legal Governor , of Louisiana. It was not pertincht. j to th is inquiry to determine that question, ' the sole and exclusive question being us J to what form of credential-the respective j claimants presented. Air. Blaine declared that there.was no j J more official ground for speaking of John j McEnery as Goverlior of Louisiana than I there was for speaking of the gentleman I [Wood] as Governor of New York. I This department of the Government had j never recognized AlcEnery, and the ! House at the last session by a very large | vote, to which many gentlemen on the Democratic side of the House were con | senting and many of them anxious that j j the resolution should pass, had solemnly j recognized Kellogg as Governor of Lou- j j isiana, and for the gentleman from New ; ^ ork to make the statement that the . i Governorship of L< uisiana was still a I matter of doubt?was still in suspense, I i wa.- to place the House in a wrong posii I lion. i, | lie thought tliat the Clerk would have . | been perfectly justified in tearing 'upas s ! waste paper the credentials signet! by > | MeKnery. lie trusted that the gentle i i man from New York did not wishtoopen . I up the whole Loui-iuna cast on this qi.es| i tion. , Air. Wood replied that the papers in . the ease id' all the members lroni Lotiisil ana were themselves a sufficient answer i to the gentleman, for if there was no f possible question as to who was Goverj nor ol Louisiana, why was . | it that all the members of | that State had deemed it necessary toobI lain the certificate of MeKnery, unless ; they deemed it important to come here clothed w ith the certificate of each Govr ernor? Ho did not propose to raise in ' this inquiry the question as to who was ' j or was not Governor ot L< uisiana. 'i he . ' question to be determined in tho first ! place was whether Morev presented ero. i dentials that entitled hint to a seat oil this lloor. Mr. Wheeler said lie had trusted ? that the question as to who was Governor "t of Louisiana hud been set at rest at ' lea-t until the next general election, and regreled that for tiiis paltry advantage it should again be raised.

The House ' was in possession of the fact that there ' i was such a controversy.

He hoped 1 tlie gentleman from Mew York [Wood] would, acting on the suggestion of Mr. , lloar. modify his resolution by omitting the preamble and merely rclerring the - matter to the Committee on Elections u with instructions to report on the prima ii | facie case. 1 . .Mr Wood inodilicd hi; resolution aci cordingly. 1 Slax ioenl of ihc < Irrk. r i The Clerk of the House with pcrmisu sion of the House made the following i-1 statement: The controlling fact, which, e hi my judgment, required me to accept d the Kellogg certificate, was that prior to 4 the making up of the roll on the 4th of ?- March last, there had been a recognition y by the House of Representatives of Win. j t l'itt Keilogg as Governor of J,oui-inna. y and that at that time ho was ,U. /? /?

A tier further discussion, participated d in by Messrs. llolman, Banks, Cox and e i Jones, the previous question was

Mr. Randall suggested to strike out of the motion that purl recognizing Kellogg as Governor. Mr. Blaine s?M be was perfectly will- I ing to do so, and having so modified it, the motion was agreed to and Mr. Morey was sworn in accordingly.* The questions as to the right of Goode of Virginia were next taken up and after a short discussion Mr. Goode was sworn in as a member, taking the modified oath. The question as to the Vacancy in the thirty-third district of Sew York was then taken up and after statements by Messrs.

FOREIGN. Dreadful ?xplo*ioii In bColliery. | London, December 6.?The colliery at which the dreadful explosion aceurred to-day belongs to Mitchell & Co., and is I one of the largest in Southern Yorkshire. ' It is joined by underground workings J with* Edmund's ninin colliery, where j twelve years ago yesterday over three j hundred persons perished. The works extend for many miles. They are entirely worked with safety lamps, under rigid : discipline and were considered safe. At ( six o'clock about three hundred men and boys descended and commenced work as usual. At *J:30 a 'terrible explosion j occurred. The exact position of the ex- j plosion is at present unknown, but the J i miners of all parts of the pit were j j startled by a loud report, followed by | large volumes of smoke, and those who I were able rushed to the pit bottom, but the drawing cage was displaced. As I soon as possiblo volunteers were organ; izod to search lor the dead and dying, I and those who had escaped. After being down for some time the volunteers j reported that they had met with great j difficulty. They saw many who were I alive, hut unconscious. It is impossible | now to give the number lost. It is | feared that the tirst report (two hun! sJrn/ll will h<? <?r?nfirmivl thoiifh j the managers nt the colliery hope that many may he saved. The operatives of I all the collieries of tho district are on the spot, ready and anxious to do every- j thing possible lor the relief of the sutlerers. All the local surgeons have also ar[ rived. All those rescued thus far are seriously burned and otherwise injured. Hundreds of men, women and children are congregated at the inouth of the pit, arid rus tho bodies are drawn to the surface the sceno is of the most heart-rend' ing character. Latest accounts from the Swaithe colliery indicalo that the total number ol lives lost was 140. The explosion was caused by careless blasting operations. Another disaster of a similar character is reported to day, in a coal mine 'near Pentyreh, in south Wales, in which twelve persons were killed and injured I lorolKii Uraln .Murkrli. London, December C.?The Mark ! Lane Express, in a review of the grain j markets of the past week, says: "The i unusually severe winter having com- j pletely stopped field <ubor, and partially | closed tho Baltic, has caused wheat to harden somewhat, but owing to the quantity of grain in granary, there is little prospect of a materiul advance before spring. Tho character of the weather, then, will be unusually important. Should anything happen, an advance of ten shillings would easily occur. In l'aris Hour has recovered one franc. Good samples of wheat are rather dearer. The same remark applies to the French provinces, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria and Hungary. Kain has fallen in Northern Africa." TIipNiii'x Canal <i iichI Ion. J.onlk>n, December 7.?A special from Berlin says: It is considered probable in , St. Petersburg that Russia wi.l propose I an International conference on the Suez !
