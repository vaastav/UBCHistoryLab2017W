With the vigor of language for which Mr. Roosevelt is famous, he says the stories are "scur rilous and libelous in character and false in every particular." He scores Delavan Smith and the Indianapolis News, but reserves his most forceful and merciless language for Dr. Joseph Pulitzer, who is popularly supposed to have inspired Hearst and others with the "yellow journal" idea which is responsible for so much trouble in the United States, but by various philan thropies, including the establishment of a university chair of Journalism, has sought to make amends for any over zealousness he may have displayed in gathering news and amassing wealth. Of Dr. Pulitzer and his paper the president says: "It is idle to say that the known character of Mr. Pulitzer and his newspaper are such that the statements in that paper will be be lieved by nobody; unfortunately thou sands of persons are ill informed in this respect and believe the statements they see printed, even though they ap pear in a newspaper published by Mr. Puilitzer." Apparently congress was greatly tickled by the seriousness with which the president took the sensational newspaper stories which were the sub ject of his complaint, for his caustic characterization of Pulitzer and the tribe of yellow journalists was received, we are told, first with ripples of mer riment and then with shouts of laugh ter. In justice to Mr. Pulitzer it should be said he has lost or almost lost his eyesight, and for a long time has been in feeble health, so it is hardly prob able he is personally responsible for the somewhat frenzied course of his paper with regard to the Panama ca nal. It is generally understood that the World, "owned hy Joseph Pulit zer," is In reality the organ of a clique of powerful eastern capitalists; and if the attorney general should bring pro ceedings against Ml. Pulitzer, it is probable his Wall street "affinities" will be exposed—which is a consum mation most devoutly to be wished, es pecially If it be true that one of the mo3t prominent financial millionaire- magnates in the country has a finger in the pie. It will be very joyful if the Wall street anti-Roosevelt gang is exposed through proceedings against poor old Joe. And, as Salrey Gamp would have said, "which the initials of one of them are supposed to be J. P. M." George Harvey, once editor of tho World, now editor of Harper'H, knows a good deal about It. If there is an Investigation, he should be put on the witness stand. \ lion i' Angeles Humana society has made a report showing that during six months it has done much good work In this city '"'" - < 

SANTA CLAUS SANTA CLAFS needs 800 pairs of •hoes for The Herald's Christmas festivity for boys and girls. Of course he doesn't need them for his own use. Ho is neither a centipede nor a millionaire. He knows at least 250 boys and filrls, each the fortunate possessor «f one pair of feet, but each by a freak of fortune compelled to wear bad shoes or go barefoot. As a' matter of fact many of them sfo barefoot. There are many barefoot children in Los Angeles—barefoot not from choice or because they wish to get the fu benefit of the climate, but barefoot because they have to be; because their parents cannot afford to buy them shoes for everyday wear. Some of thorn have a' pair which they are allowed to don on Sundays. We have known of some families in which there was a special arrangement among the little folks by which brothers and sisters wore shoes "turn about" on church or state occasions. Now we think every little boy and girl in Los Angeles should have at leost ono pair of shoes. Don't you agree with us? We cannot believe you would say: "No. According to the social law there are some boys and girls who have no rlffht to wear shoes, or anything else." No good American would say that, and yet many good Americans are com pelled to assent or to seemingly assent to similar propositions, simply because they are not in a position to help the helpless and dependent masßes who form a laxge proportion of the popula> tlon. We have heard some good friends say: "Well, there are no barefoot boys and girls in Los Angeles—that Is to say, there are none who are compelled by necessity to get along without shoes." Unfortunately we have evidence which compels us to be unable to agree with this. We have not the slightest doubt that a little army of barefoot boys and girls could be mar shaled without much trouble, at short notice; and we have heard of boys and girls who were so big they were ashamed to go outdoors without shoes, and had no money with which to buy them. "And this was in I,os Angeles?" Oh, yes. This was In Los Angeles. The Salvation Army and other philanthropic organizations can give you exact In formation on this subject. Los Angeles is a beautiful city, and the most prosperous In the United States, but there Is ample Justification for the resolution of Santa Claus to provide a Christmas dinner and enter tainment for boys and girls, and we have no apologies to offer for keeping up this peculiar style of Christmas carol, day after day. Now that the Associated Charities or ganization has Joined forces with Tho Herald in arranging the Christmas din ner and entertainment, the festivity is assuming proportions greater than at first contemplated. We thought it would grow, but hardly thought Jt would grow so big. Tho Herald is confronted with the problem of feeding and entertain ing not fewer than 3000 hungry boys and girls! We thank heartily all friends who have forwarded money or supplies. It Is a good work. Keep It up. And many more volunteers are needed to help do the honors of the feast. If you write to the Santa Claus editor and tell him what you would like to do we have no doubt you will receive an as signment that will please you. HYGIENE IF the city council would give heed to the testimony of medical men of the caliber of those who spoke before the City club recently—one of whom was the fvuthority whose word with regard to sanitary matters in Los Angeles should almost be equivalent to law —there would be less disposition to quibble and squabble over the garbage question, and procrastinate Indefinitely its settlement. Of all the extraordinary, fantastic, unreasonable and disgusting methods of disposing of garbage that has yet been called to the attention of the long suffering public that of feeding It to the hogs Is "easily worst." Dr. Kress, secretary of the public health commission of the State Medical association, says the practice of dis posing of garbage for the purpose of feeding hogs is Insanitary and a menace to public health. Think of hogs nour ished on the offal and refuse of a great city! Wo hope some arrangement will be mnde soon, by which a sane ftfid sanitary method of disposing of gar bage will be adopted. And we hope the practice of using it for hog feed will be discontinued immediately. Surely when the owners of hogs under stand they are running a risk of poison- Ing an entire community they will adopt a cleanly method of feeding. Strictly sanitary nations refuse to eat hogs' flesh, because they realize it may contain virulent germs. Indeed, there is hardly a provision of the old Musaic law that Is not founded upon sanitary and scientific principles, and for every thing that is forbidden there is a good and sufficient reason. Modern practi tioners have a high regard for the wis dom of Moses, which la of as much value to the human race today as ever it w;in. Our leaders unite with ub in expressing the hope that all possible care will be taken to put Los Angeles and Los Angeles county on a: sound hygienic basis. Filthy feeding of hogs and careless keeping of dairy cattle muat be stopped. Philanthropic organizations have un der consideration the advisability of establishing a wood yard at which poor people may always find work. Many and quaint are the subterfuges to which our harassed civilization re sorts in its vain attempts to solve tha social problem. Emma Goldman has been sent against her will to Canada, which she sayg is too tame a country for her. Carrie Nation Ikih gone of her own .ni to Scotland, which »he aays is easily the wickedest country on earth. Hoochl LOS ANGELES HERALD: WEDNESDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 16, 190& Seems to Be Thoroughly Cleaned -r-^ »...,._ >.._,..- - TEACHERS' TOUR mWELVE teachers selected by the people will visit the Alaska-Yu -*■ kon-Paclflc exposition which will be held at Seattle, Wash., from June 1 to October 15, 1909, The Herald will ar range and superintend the trip, but The Herald does not care to assume the responsibility of choesing twelve teachers from the big army of success ful and worthy workers who constitute the teaching force of the territory in cluded in the contest. Six school teach ers will be chosen from Los Angeles county, three from the city of Los An geles and three from the county at large outside the city. One will be selected from San Ber nardino county, one from Orange coun ty, one from Santa Barbara county, one from Riverside county, one from Kern county and one from Ventura county. As our advertisement says, "So oppor tunity haß been presented whereby so much pleasure and benefit may be de rived at no cost to the great workers who are shaping the destiny of the na tion." Our friends will doubtless take ad vantage of this opportunity to help pay a debt of gratitude due to the teacherr. They form the most self sacrificing class In the community. Their work requires most careful prep aration, and they must study constant ly in order to keep up with the ever increasing requirements of modern edu cation. A teacher's life Is practically divided between studying and impart ing knowledge. The proposed excursion is not alto gether a "pleasure trip," because it combines instruction with pleasure. But it is an easy and agreeable manner of acquiring a store of information which will be of great use to the schools and school children of Los An geles. We have no doubt the twelva teachers who make the trip to the ex position will come back with renewed health and with a greatly increased store of knowledge, of which the boys and girls of Los Angeles and our ad mirable school system will receive the benefit. SCHOOLS IT IS a pleasure to be able to record ' that the grand Jury not only ex onerates the city board of educa tion of any charge of mismanagement, but commends its work in caring for the affairs of the educational institu tions of Los Angeles. While discoveries have been made that there have been what are technically improper diver sions of funds, this is due to errors in bookkeeping. The report said In closing: "In view of the early bond election to supply additional school funds for this rapidly growing city, and In ttia interests of education we have gone into all actions by the board of edu cation, especially in their handling of school fund*, and have thoroughly ex amined the same, and wo find there ha 3 been no misappropriation of school funds in any manner whatsoever." Now let every citizen wear the orange button inscribed, "WE WANT MORK SCHOOLS," and prepare to do his duty and permit the rapidly Increasing pop ulation of Los Angeles to have a num ber of schoolß suited to its needs. We must make it impossible to have chil dren crowded out of school in Los An geles. What can restore a child's youth? What can take the place of ed ucation? From the great Industrial centers of the east come tales of the increase of illiteracy due to the fact that many children are being sent to work in mines, mills and factories when they shtfuld be attending school. When there are not sufficient school accommodations there is an excuse for sending children to work before they »/e fitted for drudgery. Parents will tell you they have hired them out in order to take them off the streets! The schools of Los Angeles should have enough accommodations to "take the children off the streets," and In this beautiful, progressive. Intellectual clt> there should never be the slightest ex cuse for illiteracy or for child labor. We need more schools. We must have them. HEAVENLY HYOOSTON ACCORDING to the Houston Dally Post, a newspaper published In a Mttle city In Texas, "Cussing Bob Evans has declined the offer of a beau tiful home In Los Angeles. It Is evi dently difficult for that city to offer Inducements enough for discriminating people to live there." We do not know what may be the Inducements to dis criminating people to Uvo In Houston. We presume the population of Houston, which Is estimated at 60,000, consists al together of discriminating people; al though for our part we are Inclined to think they are discriminated against rather than discriminating. It is because discriminating people are flocking to Los Angeles from every part of the Union that the population is growing at a rate which keeps build ing contractors busy all the year round. In the metropolitan district of Los An geles there are now 800,000 people, and most of the hoads of families own their own homes. The climate Is heavenly all the year round from January to De cember. We don't need to keep up a perpetual din about the superiority of Los Angeles, for people are finding It out for themselves. As far as Houston Is concerned, we don't understand why the Journalistic roosters should crow, because every well Informed person knows that when It rains there the ekles precipitate such floods that the cltliens of Houston have to chain up their houses to keep them from salting away; and when the rains cease (which wo must admit they sometimes do) tt»e streets are like hog wallows. The chief raison d'etre of the Post Is that It puts Hyooston on the map from time to time by Its yawps at the outside world. Without Judd Mortimer Lewis the Post would remain In de served obscurity; without the Post Houston would enjoy a merited pro longed snooze. According to the enthusiastic Land o'-Burns man who is secretary of ag riculture in the United States, in four months the farmers of this country raised corn representing a money value "that would pay the Interest-bearing deb?of the United States, pay for, the Panama canal and fifty battleships be sides." It Is too bad Mr. Wilson should speak of battleships in connection with corn. That is not what hla fellow- countryman, Robert Burns, would have said. Burns would have thought of happy homes and "wives and weans" he thought of the mountain of corn-wealth. But that is why Burns, if he had come to the United States, would never have held a position like that of secretary of agriculture. We learn that President Rooßevelt has "ananlased" another leading cltl- zen. This is bad for the citizen but good for the language. We look for ward cheerfully to the day when It will be roosevelted and the vocabulary will be enriched by such trenchant terms as inbadded, nature-fakered —or, chief ety mological wonder of all—shorterandug llered. The P.oosevelt policy applied to the language may yet add to It a col lection of verbal strenuositips which will raise the dead dictionary-makers. John D. Rockefeller's double attended the Fifth Avenue Baptist church In New York and was the recipient of a great deal of adulation to which he was not entitled.

THEATERS HOUSE OF THOUSAND CANDLES, MELODRAMA MUCH CLATTER AND NOISE TO SMALL PURPOSE Auditorium Players Work Heroically, but Dramatic Version Is Even Worse Than the Book LEMUEL PARTON The Lewis S. Stone company offers howling melodrama of the most vo ciferous type in "The House of a Thousand Candles" at the Auditorium this week. Happily there is no blood letting and the only casualties aro several strained suspenders and a I caved-in door. Meredith Nicholson's book, as a book, is not so bad as it might be, but as a play it works out Into a sort of Inverted pig-in-tho clover proposition—rather diverting, but lacking In dramatic merit. Old John Gtenarm, to test the loy alty of his grandson, makes a will, leaving him his estate, on condition of | his living a year in a weird country house which he, tha elder Glenarm, has built inthe wilds of Indiana. He gives out the news of'his death, but decides not to die really, but to stick around awhile and see what his grandson does. Young John returns to New York after a sort of genteel pan handling expedition around the world and Is told of his grandfather's death and his strange will by Arthur Pick ering, the elder Glenarm's attorney. This man Pickering is a very wicked sort of person; you must remember that. Glenarm heroically decides to accede to the terms of his grand father's will and to go to the Indiana house and live for a year and pull down the inheritance. The Woman Appears In caso of Jack's refusal to fulfill the requirements of the will the prop erty is to go to Miss Marian Dever eaux, whom the young man has seen at Sherry's and with whom he has promptly fallen in love. He goes to live at the house and Miss Devereaux appears and he asks her to marry him, not knowing who she is. Bates, a faithful servant, in whose hands the care of tire younger Glenarm has been | entrusted by the elder, Is at the house, and If you are a good guesser you may be able to decide whether ho Is as shifty as the elusive card In a rouge et noir deck, or as loyal as an old servant should be. You are en lightened at the end of the play. The wicked Pickering, who, It appoars, has borrowed money from the elder Glen arm and Is anxious to get back the notes, thinks they are hidden in the house, with some other treasure, and hires the caretaker Morgan to prowl around the house and sound the walls with a hammer. Morgan Is an un pleasant, red-headed man. One of the best things he docs is to spread out his legs far enough apart to allow a tamale cart to be driven through, and then say "har! har!" Just like that. There Is a fighting parson, an adjunct of a nearby young women's school, a facetious Irishman and a glrly-glrly young man from the seminary. Also one ferocious sheriff. The will provides that If Glenarm marries or becomes engaged that the property goes to Miss Devereaux. Pickering, learning from Morgan, who was In hiding In a secret recess in the wall when Glenarm did his love mak ing, that Glenarm had asked the young woman to marry him, declares that the will Is broken, and summons the sheriff to evict Glenarm. There Is a fight In the house at midnight, and just as the sheriff's forces seem about to conquer, the old man steps out of another secret recess In the wall. He hadn't been dead at all! Maria Devereaux was one of his best friends and had been In on the plot to try out young John, or whatever It was they were trying to do to him. Bates also Is vindicated, and everything ia Just as lovely as can be. Strain Canons of Art There are many methods allowable In the making of books which cannot be used In tho structure of plays. No dramatist trying painstakingly to vio late every known law of dramatic art could have succeeded better than Mr. Middleton and Mr. Nicholßon have to gether. The most glaring defect of tho piece appears In the failure of tho au thor to take the audience Into his con lldonce regarding the fact that the old man Is not actually dead, and that Bates Is not the villain Glenarm be lieves him to be. If there Is one law of play building that Is elementary, It la this one. The Stone aggregation has done all that good acting and good staging pos sibly could do for such a play. ■ • • "Mice and Men," Madeline Lucette Ryley's pretty little play, is on for the week at the Belasco. Crinoline and hoop-skirts may pass, but the interest of such Innocent little human dramas seems not to have lessoned. "Sweet Kitty Pelalr!"," "She Stoops to Con quer" and all the other plays of the stilted "thee" and "thou" of eighteenth century days are as popular as ever. AT THE HOTELS The hotel registers Indicate that the Influx of eastern visitors continues un abated. Among the many regular winter vis itors to Los Angeles are Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Mordough of Mexico City, who are stopping at the Alexandria. Mr. Mordough is well known throughout the Republic of Mexico, where he has lived many years. He was the first president of the United States Bank- Ing company, an American financial in stitution which has become one of tna leading banks of the Mexican capital. Mr. Mordough has now retired from active business and passes hia time looking after hla many Interests in Mexico and the United States. During past years he has Invested consider ably in Los Angeles, but it is pleasure rather than business that brings him here each winter. Mr. and Mrs. Mordough have been extensively entertained since their ar rival here last week. Saturday night an Informal reception waa given In their honor by Mrs. J. Andrews of 209 West Eighteenth street. The guests were mostly old friends of Mr. and Mrs. Mordough. Much to the regret of their many friends the Mordoughs are leaving Fri day for Mexico City in order to pass Christmas with their children. Mr. and Mrs. "W. F. N. Davis and their son, John B. Davia, well known residents of Houston, Tex., have come to Los Angeles for a considerable stay and are located at the Angelus. Major C. J. Robs and wife of River side are spending a few days in the city and are registered at the Alexan dria. Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Sanderson, travelers from London, England, also and "Mico and Men" spoms no moro stage worn than the others. Miss Dorothy Bernard is happily cast as "Peggy" the artless and Insouciant young ward of Mark Kinbury. Miss Bernard always is pleasing, but In thia role she Is exceptionally .so, and she nd<ls much to the plny's suggestion of innocent and conventional simplicity. A. H. Van Huron is perhaps a trifle young for the part of the severe scholar and scientist, but does the part ex tremely well, Ttichard Vivian for onco is not seen In a character part. Ho Beems to bo naturally placed as tho lover of the. charming Peggy, but ap pears a trille heavy at times. Mr. Ron Graham's Roger Gondlake is admirably done. The play is well staged and tho costuming is good. • • • Miss Dorothy Bernard announced yesterday that, she will leave Los An geles ;it the end of her Belasco en gagement, which will be concluded thia week, and go to New York. Miss Bernard was offered a position with the new Belasco-Blackwood company, which will open soon In the Belasco, but as It appeared she might be re quired to pf;iy second to another In genue which the management was con sidering, she decided to go to New York. "I have two opportunities In New York, one of which I may accept," said Miss Bernard last evening. "I do not care to discuss my reasons for leav ing. It is true that I had two oppor tunities to remain In Los Angeles, but I do not see my way clear to accept either of them." Miss Bernard has been extremely popular during her ctay in Los Angeles and It will be with much regret that the theater-goers of the city will learn of her departure. Glowing prophecies have been made regarding her future success and her large following in the west expects to see much of her. N. C. Goodwin's play of last season, "The Easterner," will be the first offer ing of Lewis S. Stone and the Belasco Theater company at the Belasco under the new managerial conditions that will prevail after December 28. The piece is by George H. Broadhurst, who Is re sponsible for "The Man of the Hour," "What Happened to Jones" and a num ber other unusually successful plays. "The Easterner" is a California play. Tho central figure—the part that will be played by Stone —is a' young fellow who has gone through a fortune of considerable dimensions in the east and has come west to Interest himself in an irrigation—land irrigation, not tho personal sort —project. Of course there is a youni» woman in the case, and this young woman must needs have w younger brother, whom the easterner is called upon to protect and save when the youngster Is wrongly accused of a sci knis crime. 'The Easterner" is full of bi'lght, snappy comedy lines, and the situations aro of the kind that aro calculated to arouse the average thea ter patron to manifestations of more than common enthusiasm. It is a sin- gularly good play in which to intro duce Stone and his stage associates to a' Belasco audience, and the newly or ganized company may be expected to give a performance that will pass mus ter with the most captious. There probably Is not one person in a thousand who has seen a diver In his suit of mall and air working in deep water. Tales are told of heroic work by men in this business and the method used is certainly extremely interesting. In this city at present is a man who holds the world record for deep sea diving, and arrangements have been made by the management of the "Made In Southern California exposition" to have him make a display of his abllltv to remain In the water and to demon strate tho apparatus by which work below the water is made possible. O. Ollason is a modest appearing man and doesn't like to talk about himself. He Is tall and sturdy and has what every diver must hay strong heart and magnificent pair of lungs. Tester day he said: "I have been down 165 feet where the pressure is eighty-three pounds to tho square Inch, and that is a record. It was on the Australian const where a large vessel had sunk with nearly 200 people aboard, and I wont after the bodies. I worked with some freedom, but of course could not stay down for any great length of time. I am ;i!>le to stay under witter at ordinary depths where divers usual - ly work for from four to eight hours, and when my tank is completed here I think I will be able to surprise people with the great length of time I cm: endure artificial respiration. Every thing will be arranged just as It la when I am working at sea or In rivers, and I will be glad to explain the ap paratus for the benefit of the public." m. • • "Why I have seen babies and bable«, but never so interesting a lot as these." said Nurse Baker of the Clara Barton hospital last night at the "Made in Southern California exposition," and Nurse Cloud of the Good Samnrltiui hospital approved of the sentiment. Surely Los Angeles should be proud of Its product in that direction. Yester day was devoted to babies of 6 months and under, Mid a fine, clean, healthy looking lot they were. Proud mothers took great pride in them and were de lighted when the hoHts of spectators admired them. Today will be devoted to babies of from 6 months to 2 years. Lewis Stone Is to be Judge on this day. and will endeavor to give the good mothers his opinion as to whether the baby will make a good actor or not. Thursday John Blackwood will judgo the children of from 3 to 5 years of age and will probably pick an ingenue for his new stock company. are making their headquarters at the Alexandria while seeing Southern Cali fornia. Judge Frank H. Farrar of Merced, a well known California Jurist, who at one time held a position on the su preme bench, arrived in Los Angeles yesterday and Is making headquarters at the Angolua. Prof. A. V. Stubenraneh, an authority and writer on horticulture and profes sor In tho agricultural college at the University of California, is making a short stay in tha city and Is registered at the Hayward. It will be of Interest to the many followers of the races md members of the racing fraternity In general to know that Barney Schrelber, one of the promoters of Santa Anita, la here again and Is stopping, as usual, at the Van Nuys. Friends of E. A. Hoonbeck of San Diego will be glad to hear that he Is In the city. Mr. Hoenbeck la well known to railroad circles in this city. He will remain here a few days be fore returning to his home city, ana Is located at the Angelus. Among the arrivals at the Alexandria yesterday was W. H. Dupee, who reg isters from Wisconsin. He Is better known, however, as a member of tho Chicago firm of Schwartz, Dupee & Co., stock brokers. Mr. Dupee owns a large ranch in Old Mexico, across the line from San Diego, where he is planning to pass the winter. J. N. Henderson of the firm of Hen derson Bros., wholesale dealers from Vancouver, B. C, registered yesterday at the Lankershlm. Mr. Henderson and hla brother and partner, T. M. Hen derson, with their nieces. Miss Muriel and Miss Evelyn Henderson, are i ing the winter season in California. The brother and nieces aro now at Redlands, but are expected in Los An geles today.
