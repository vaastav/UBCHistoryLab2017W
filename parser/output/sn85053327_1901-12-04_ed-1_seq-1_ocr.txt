PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S JjRST MESSAGE Recommends the Creation of Another Cabinet Officer, to Be Called SECRETARY OF COMMERCE The President Recommends the Irrigation of the West by the Government—Says the Tribal Relations of the Indians Should Be Broken Up. Washington, Dec. 3.—The president in his annual message to congress says: The congress assembles this year under the shadow o£ a great calam ity. On the 0th of September Presi dent McKinley was shot by an an- ' archist while attending the Pan American exposition at Buffalo and died in that city on the 14th of that month. Of the last seven elected presidents he is te third who has been mur dered, and the bare recital of this fact is sufficient to justify grave alarm among all loyal American citi zens. Moreover, the circumstances of this, the third assassination of an American president, have a peculiar ly sinister significance. Both Pres ident Lincoln and President Garfield were killed by assassins of types un fortunately not uncommon in history. President Lincoln falling a victim to the terrible passions aroused by four years of civil war and President Gar field to the revengeful vanity of a disappointed office seeker. President McKinley was killed by an utterly de praved criminal belonging to that class of criminals who object to all governments, good and bad alike, who are against any form of popular liberty if it is guaranteed by even the most just and liberal laws and who are as hostile to the upright ex ponent of a free people's sober will as to the tyrannical and irresponsi ble despot. Anarchy and Anarchists. The president continues with a eulogy of Mr. McKinley, then turns to the subject of anarchy, denouncing its doctrines and preachers. He says: I earnestly recommend to the con gress that in the exercise of its wise discretion it should take into consid eration the coming to this country of anarchists or persons professing prin ciples hostile to all government and justifying the murder of those placed in authority. Such individuals as those who not long ago gathered in open meeting to glorify the murder of King Humbert of Italy perpetrate a crime, and the law should insure their rigorous punishment. They and those like them should be kept out of this country, and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came, and far reaching provision should be made for the punishment of those who stay. No matter calls more urgently for the wisest thought of the congress. A Subject For Federal Courts. The federal courts should be given jurisdiction over any man who kills or attempts to kill the president or any man who by the constitution or by law is in line of succession for the presidency, while the punishment for an unsuccessful attempt should be proportioned to the enormity of the offense against our institutions. Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all mankind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made an offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man stealing known as the slave trade. The president next considers busi ness conditions, which he finds highly satisfactory. He continues: The tremendous and highly com plex industrial development which went on with ever accelerated rapid ity during the latter half of the nine teenth century brings us face to face at the beginning of the twentieth with very serious social problems. The old laws and the old customs which had almost the binding force of law were once quite sufficient to regulate the accumulation and distribution of wealth. Since the industrial changes which have so einormously increased the productive power of mankind they are no longer sufficient. Trade Combinations. The growth of cities has gone on beyond comparison faster than the growth of the country, and the up building of the great industrial cen ters has meant a startling increase not merely in the aggregate of wealth, but in the number of very large indi vidual and especially of very large corporate fortunes. The creation of these great corporate fortunes has not been due to the tariff nor to any other governmental action, but to natural causes in the business world, operating in other countries as they operate in our own. The process has aroused much an tagonism, a great part of which is wholly without warrant. It is not true that as the rich have grown richer the poor have grown poorer. On the contrary, never before has the average man, the wage earner, the farmer, the small trader, been so well off as in this country and at the pres ent time. There have been abuses connected with the accumulation of wealth, yet it remains true that a for tune accumulated in legitimate busi ness can be accumulated by the per son specially benefited only on condi tion of conferring immense incidental benefits upon others. Successful en terprise of the type which benefits all mankind can only exist if the con ditions are such as to offer great prizes as the rewards of success. Reasons Fov Caution. The president adds that there are many reasons for caution in dealing with corporations. He says: The same business conditions which have produced the great ag gregations of corporate and individ ual wealth have made them very po tent factors in international commer cial "competition. Moreover, it can not too often be pointed out that to strike with ignor ant violence at the interests of one set of men almost inevitably endan gers the interests of all. The funda mental rule in our national life—the rule which underlies all others—is that, on thte whole and i.n the long run, we shall go up or down together. The mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfree with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance. In dealing with business interests, for the government to undertake by crude and ill considered legislation to do what may turn out to be bad, would be to incur the risk of such far reaching national disaster that it would be preferable to undertake nothing at all. The men who demand tho impossible or the undesirable serve as the allies of the forces with which they are nominally at war, for they hamper those who would en deavor to find out in rational fashion what the wrongs really are and to what extent and in what manner it is practicable to apply remedies. Hew to Correct the Evils. All this is true, and yet it is also true that there are real and grave evils, one of the chief being overcap italization because of its many bale ful consequences, and a resolute and practical effort must be made to cor rect these evils. It is no limitation upon property rights or freedom of contract to re quire that when men receive from government the privilege of doing business under corporate form, which frees them from individual responsi bility and enables them to call into their enterprises the capital of the public, they shall do so upon abso lutely truthful representations as to the valute of the property in which the capital is to be invested. Corpor ations engaged in interstate com merce should be regulated if they are found to exercise a license working to the public injury. It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the busi ness world of crimes of cunning as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence. Great corpora tions exist only because they are created and safeguarded by our in stitutions, and it is therefore our right and our duty to see that they work in harmony with these institutions. Publicity the First Essential. The first, essential In determining how to deal with the great industrial combinations is knowledge of the facts—publicity. In the interest of the public the government should have the right to Inspect and exam ine the workings of the great corpor ations engaged in interstate business. Publicity is the only sure remedy (Continued on sixth page.) Cashier of a White Sulphur Springs Bank Suicides. ;ot IN THE 

BRAIN HIS MIND UNBALANCED Family Troubles Supposed to Be the Cause Had Been a Resident of Montana for Several Years. Helena, Dec. 3.—Hugh Cameron, assistant cashier of the First Na tional bank of White Sulphur Spiings, shot himself today while me el ally deranged, inflicting a wound that proved fatal a short time afterwards. Cameron and his wife have not lived together for a number of years, and it is thought that domestic trouble finally unbalanced his mind. For the* last few days he has been acting strangely, and to personal acquaint ances bad expressed the fear that his mind was going to fail him. Last night the annual meeting of the Martinsdale Sheep company, of which Cameron was secretary, was held. Instead of going to the meet ing, where he was expected, he went to the bank, where the janitor found him later, sitting alone, and staring at the floor. Shortly afterwards Cam eron left the bank, saying to the janitor that he was going to his room at Mr. HartfiCld's. In the meantime Mr. Cameron's ab sence from the meeting led to a search for him, but nothing more was seen of him until early this morn ing. A brother of Editor Sutherlin of the Husbandman found Cameron sitting on a log near his house on th® outskirts of the town, chilled through from the night's exposure. Cameron accepted Sutherlin's invitation to come inside and have a cup of cot foe. and word was sent to Cameron's friends. Foreman Winscott of the Husbandman started in Cameron's room at Sutherlin's house for the pur pose of inducing Cameron to accom pany him to town. As he opened the door Cameron fired a pistol, inflict ing a wound in his own temple, from which he died at 10 a. m. The dead man was about 55 years old, a Scotch man, but had lived in Montana about 25 years. He was a prominent mem ber of the Odd Fellows. His wife is living in the east and the two daugh ters are, so far as known, the only other relatives. 

MURDER OVER TAMALES. Gun Play at Butte With Fatal Ef fect*. Butte, Dec. 3.—Early this morning at the Swiss Home saloon, at the corner of Mercury and Arizona streets, Joseph Marino, an Italian ta male peddler, was shot and killed by "Bull Dog" Salvagora, another Ital ian, and a rival vender of tamales. The trouble between the two men has been of long standing, and was occasioned by rivalry in the tamale business and frequent disputes over their respective territories. Tonight they met at the corner of the above named streets and hostilities re sumed. After entering the saloon the battle was quickly on, resulting in two rapid «hots from the gun of Salvagora which pierced Marino's body, inflicting wo»*nds from which he died shortly afterwards. The slayer backed out of the saloon hold ing a large crowd at bay, and made his escape into the night. Posses started in pursuit but at 3 o'clock a. m. no clew to the slayer had been discovered.

TREAT WITH REBELS Peace Commissioners Appointed to Negotiate With Insurgent Leaders—Few Guerilla Bands Continue to Fight. Colon. Colombia, Dec. 3.—Accord ing to news just received here today the interior of the country is almost pacified and quiet. Only a few scat tered insurgent banns are here am' there, waging guerrilla warfare, causing the government but little anxiety. The triumph of the Colom bian conservative government of the isthmus will incalculably strengthen the government's hands. A peace commission of Florenzo Arosmero, representing prominent liberals of Panama; Manuel Amadora, represent ing the Colombian government, and General Delarasa, secretary of the insurgent general, Domingo Diaz, has started for the interior to obtain an Interview with the generals, Diaz and Jugo, and induce them to give up the struggle and return to Panama. Senor Amadora is empowered to grant rea sonable terms to General Diaz in the name of the government. The com missioners are expected to retur;i to Panama tomorrow. THREE INTERPRETATIONS. Confliction of Orders the Cause of the Big Wabash Wreck. Adrian, Mich., Dec. 3.—It is ex pected that the coroner's jury which has investigated the disastrous wreck on the Wabash railroad near Seneca last Wednesday night, in which many Italian immigrants were crushed >nd burned to death, will render its ver dict tomorrow. The testimony today brought out the fact that there were at least three different interpreta tions of the train dispatcher's order. BULLER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES. London, Dec. 2.—''Buller Sunday" passed without serious incidents. The government had taken every precau tion to prevent disturbance. This included the reading at three parades last week of a special order in the military regulations which forbids officers or soldiers from "taking part in any meetings, demonstrations or processions for part v or political pur poses." A large body of police, many of whom were mounted, were stationed along the line of the procession and notably in front o- the war office. The trades unions and workingmen societies, with bands and banners, as sembled along tho embankment this afternoon. There were thousands of spectators. Owing to the difficulty of marshaling the large bodies of men, the procession '*"'*- in start ing. It was headed by a huge ban ner on which was a portrait of Gen eral Buller. The procession travers ed Northumberland avenue, Pall Mall, St. James street and Plcadilly to Hyde park. The windows of clubs, and especially of the service clubs, were crowded with sightseers. At Charing Cross several mounted police rode to the head of the proces sion and attempted to seize a plaster bust of General Buller. The man car rying the bust dashed it to the ground. This incident caused much indignation, but the leaders were able to curb and restrain the paradera, some of whom wished to attack the policemen. Opposite the war office there was much groaning and cries of "shame" from the men in the procession, but otherwise the proceedings were with out incident. When Hyde Park was reached it was almsot dark. 'Ihe confusion was so great as to render the speakers almost inaudible, but amid a roar of cheers a resolution of sympathy for General Buller was proposed and adopted with great enthusiasm. Features of the demonstration were the passing of the collection box for the workingmen's memorial to Gen eral Buller, and the largo sale of but tonhole portraits and favors of the general. It is estimated that at least 10,000 people were present at the demon stration in Hyde park. This makes it the biggest thing of its kind which has occurred for many years.

OKLAHOMA REMOVED. President Appoints New Governor For the Territory. Washington, Dec. 2.—Tin presi dent today appoint : 1 Tnmnas Ü. t-rguson g< verum o' <)!: r.hjtna, vice William M. .lenkte., removed. In taking this action the president attached to thtl papers the following memorandum : "Governor Jenkins of Oklahoma is hereby removed because of ltis im proper connection with a contract be tween tho territory and the Oklahoma Sanitarium company. The decision is based wholly upon his own wallon statements and his oral explanations of them at the hearing. "One of the duties of the terril trial governor is to enter into the contract with some person or corporation for the keeping of the insane of the terri tory. Governor Jenkins made smh a contract with the Oklahoma Sanitar ium company, a corporation, the pro moters of which reserved $10,hub of its stock for the governor and suit jeet to his orders. "In the governor's explanation of the affairs, he says he told the pro moters at the time they desired him to santcoin the contract' that it was an important contract: that I had some friends whom I would like to have interested in the company to which I owed some obligations that I would not be able to pay by an ap pointment or anything of that kind.' The stock was delivered to a banker subject to the order and was turned over to those friends whose political service the governor had also sought to reward. "The extent of the favor to th egov ernor and his friends is suggested by the fact that the only known sale of the stock since the contract was there was applause, and at the con clusion of the reading the demon strations were quite enthusiastic on the republican side. In the Senate. Tito senate listened to the first message of President Roosevelt to day mul adopted a resolution direct ing tin' appointment of a committee to co-operate with a like committee from the house to consider by what token of respect and affection con gress might express the sorrow of Lite nation upon the tragic death of the late President McKinley. The senate thon, as a further mark of respect to the memory of the late president, on motion of Mr. Foraker, adjourned at 2:30. The Message in England. London, Dec. 3.—Practically all tho morning papers published this morn ing President Roosevelt's message, with editorial comment thereupon. given out was at double the price paid for it. "As performance of the contract was to bo the sole business of the corporation, it is obvious either the territory was obligated to pay for more titan the service was worth, or that its helpless wards were to have the enormous profits contemplated taken out of their keep. "The governor's.confessed relations to tlie matter displays such a lack of appreciation of the high fiduciary na ture of the duties of his ojee as to unfit hint for their further discharge. "A sound rule of public policy ami morals forbids a public servant from seeking or accepting any personal benefit in a transaction wherein he has a public duty to perforin. "A chancellor would not for a mo ntent retain a trustee who in dealing for the trust reserved an advantage to himself. The thought, is not to lie tolerated that the president can bo less vigilant and exacting in the pub lic interest.
