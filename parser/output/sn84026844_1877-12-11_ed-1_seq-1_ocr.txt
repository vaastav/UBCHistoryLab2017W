' Thr> Fork racking Uailoeii of Wlieollug. Atone time and another a good many cilluni of Wheeling have been, direotly I or indirectly, interested in the pork buslI n<M. Many years ago Mich men aa Henry I E:buls, W. W. Sbriver, John Matthews, I?iac Irwin, Aaron Kelly, Warren, DanI lip A Co, Jernes K. Baker, Louie Bayha, I John /xckler, and a number of other I piriies whom we might name, touched I pork in a speculative way, for one or more bcmoos, and either. made or lost some money in their various venture*. In old time* it waa the custom to kill bogs in the West, at such places aa Keokuk, Peoria and Madison, and in (he ipriog bring the product by river to Wheeling, and then ship hence to Baltimore over the National Road. The busioeia was highly speculative in those days, iod inasmuch as there were no telegraph lines, and no statiatlca collected as to the bog supply of the country, and no facilities for rapid shipments by rail, those who wentjnto the packing business were like those who went "down to the sea in ihip?," they had need of the prayers of the congregation that they be not cast upon a lea shore. 1 Few men ever speculated long and sue* cwflfully in pork. Once and awhile some adventurous spirit made hia pile, but as a set off to this a thousand speculatam want ilnvn anil l?ft nn linn hahfrtrl. Mr. James R. Baker, after having lost at i one time nearly all he had in the business, got in again during the war and made a un strike, clearing about, it la said, $60,000 in one year. On the atrength of thin 1 happy chance he polled up atakea and went to Chicago, where they bore with a bigger auger than in Wheeling, and but for his untimely death would, no doubt, 1 have been an bold an operator there aa in thia little market. Messrs. NVarren, Dunlap & Co. were the Urgent packers who ever engaged in 1 the business hereabouts. They went in heavy in the fsli and winter of 1853-64, and killed 23,000 hogs. Their headquarters were on the site now occupied by the Central Glass Company, where they erected the moat capacioua concern ever aeen in these parts. It had every facility then known to the trade, and they could handle 800 hogs per day. The misfortunea of the firm grew out of the lailure of their Baltimore conaignees, to whom they had shipped a large*part of their product. Since the war the buiiness has been p.f.1 liAMfeluinla?r. i aiuci 4u>ck.a>lu "V^ICVIVU ucicauuuwuA' ccpt in a.local way. A great deal of meat for even home consumption lias been brought from the west. Dealers in meats, principally the wholesale grocers, bought in the Chicago and Cincinnati markets* and the hogsjraised in this region were shipped to Pittsburgh and Baltimore. Our farmera not did raise many hogs for market, the rage .being for sheep, During the last three or four years, however, sheep have not paid so well as formerly, and consequently more attention has been paid to hogs, and. as a natural result the pork packing business is once more look* ing up among us. On Saturday last we visited Fulton and took a look through the packing houses of D. C. List, Jr., Hchenck & Zoeckler and Geo. II. Parks. The first named succeeds to the business heretofore done by List, Davenport & Parks, and the last named goefl into business on hia own ac count in the pork houae heretofore ruu by John Muth. MeaarH.;Schenck & Zoeckler have been in buaineaa ainpe 1873, and are now butchering 250 to 300 hoga per day. The practice ia to batcher one day and cut up the next, and in tfaia way they kill from 600 to 700 per week. Their capacity is about the same as the house of Mr. List, and considerably greater than that of Mr. Muth. The List establishment has grown out of the ooncern formerly owned by Louia Bayha, who packed hoga la Fulton for many yeara, and previously in North Wheeling. The old time building haa been practically rebuilt and modernized, and now embraces conveniences by which hoga can be handled expeditiously at the leaat possible expense. Mr. John Bayha, KUU UM UU IU|IC(IU( IU kUO UUBlUEIO| nuptrintanili the house and ill operations, and will continue to do ao under the new regime. We observed that he puta up hia meata with the greatest care and tidineea, and that they come out of araoke looking aa tempting aa the fanciest bacon ever brought to Wheeling fromCinclnnati. Indeed the trade have loog preferred the home made meata of List, Davenport & Parks to their importations from Chicago and Cincinnati. Their hams are bought very freely hereabouts for domeatic consumption. Messrs. Schenck & Zjeckler are live man and have apent $32,000 In putting up a house large enough to accommodate their wants. They, too, cell considerable of their product in Wheel* ing, to the grooerymen, and also retail a considerable amount at their store on Market atreet. Mr. Moth haa never branched out much in hie ee* tabllshment, the one that Mr. Parka has uit ltased. He haa confined hia attan lion mora particularly to aupplylng the public on market daya from hb atall In the Market Hoon, ud ttio certain gram grocerlee thit mII hb famoua aauaagee. Speakiogoftheeeeauiagea.they lliuitra^e in a atriking manner the value of a repuUtion.

Why b thii f Simply becauee the public long alnoe peiaunded thenuelrea that hb aauaagee ware made ont ol the very beat of pork and put op in the cleanliaat poealble manner. Therefore, aa Artemua Wardaald about hU boarding houae huh, he alweya ate It with a rallab, "feeling certain ol what waeeet before him." Bo Of Uncle John'! aluaim. the nnhllp Ml them largely on faith. Let all boya who read thli article take heed of the moral here oonveyed, and never forget that it pays to do well whatever they undertake. Our friend Parka, who succeeds to Mr. Muth's packing business, expects to do what he cilia a "modest and quiet little buainepa," reaching perhaps 300 to 400 hogs tper week. He will employ Mr. Muth aa his foreman and practical man, while he bimaelf will more particularly devote his attention to buying the hogs and selling the product. An old proverb teaches us that "that which is well bought is half Bold," and hence they who succeed beat in business are thoae who look closely to their buy* ing operations. And thia point naturally suggests the question, are bogs sJfe at 4 1 cents live weight ? This is the price now current in thia market, although from 4.10 to4.15 is occasionally paid. Laat 1 year the packers got salted rather more than the liogs, at 7 cents, and this year they incline to light shy of everything like a "bull" feeling. There is a visible effort in the West to keep down prices. Whether it will succeed remains to be seen. As regards this section of the country, hogs are coming in freely. The j farmers who held on to their wool and got atuck do not feel inclined to hold on to their hogs. The price opened in the last days of October at 5}, and a chance farmer let go at that figure, but the bulk of salea since then have been at 4) and 41. The future of prirea ia a matter Df the merest conjecture. The news published this morning, of the fall of Plevna, , and the possible near end of the Rusao- 1 Turkish war, may exercise a depressing < Inflaence on prices of all breadstufla. Aa for the modus operandi of killing J l-t I -4 *>-t. ? ? - auu pnumug uugn ai ruuon, we nave not l thought it worth while to enlarge much on that feature of the business. The j work is bo aub-divided among fifteen to twenty men, in each of the two principal ] house*, that the duties of each man are 1 discharged with the greatest possible j rapidity, and dexterity. The man who 3 knocks down becomes an expert, aa doee ! the man who plunges the knife, and the dead porker is passed along from ' hand to hand, through the boiling , cauldron and over the bench under the 1 hands of the scrapers, at * speed quite 1 foreign te hia nature. He never stops 1 until, completely disemboweled, he tis j hoisted np to the track of one of thelittle narrow gauge avenues of the cooling room, and shot along on the rails until he hangs within a few inches of hia predecessor. And these long rows of fat porkers hang when the day's work j is done, and are not disturbed un- , til next day when they are "brought to block" and cut up into hams, shoulders, sides, brisket, clear rib, standard mesa, family mess, and we known not kna mativ nthor tfttlinin.l >l>.iuu Tk? i end of the second day flees that large lot of hogs snugly sailed down in some one of the spacious vaults of.the house, and all ; their "true inwardness" consigned to huge rendering vats and subjected to the melt- 1 ing influences of red hot steam. Nothing is waAted, not even the bristles and hair, but everything is taken'care of and old to somebody?either "to butcher and baker and candle-stick maker," or else to the haberdasher and upholsterer, and thus a profit is saved on the odds and 1 ends when otherwise a loes might be in- , curred on the carcase proper. We conclude our notice of pork pack* , ing in Wheeling with the observation that the businesa hereabouts aeems to j have taken a new departure. The houses cow in the trade expect to make a speciality of it, and will carry on both winter and summer packing. At Bchenk A Zoeckler's we saw beef that had been in one of their coolers for two weeks, and it'was just as nice, juicy and fresh as the day it was put in. The busineni done is not at all speculative in its character. Those eogaged in it buy hogs and sell the product from day to day, just as the Nail men buy their iron and sell their nails, or just as our 8togie manufacturer buy tobacco and aell cigar*. Backed as these houses are with ample experience and capital they cannot fail of a gratifying measure of success. We look forward to the day when Wheeling bacon will outrank all the brands sold in this and other markets, and take its place in public estimation along aide of Wheeling nails and Wheeling cigars. Offf. Ord's testimony in reference to the good faith of the Mexican army officers in their efforts to stop raiding along the Rio Qrande, but admitting the gene* ml connivance 01 me people on the lower part of the river, probably gives the elementa of troth in the Mexican problem. He aaka for more troops which are now on the way to that frontier. There have been rumors of a change in commanders in that department, and aome of the democratic members of Congress profess to believe that Ord is not a safe man to have there, bat nothing has been made public derogatory to his fitness. The majority for the nev constitution in Georgia and Atlanta aa capit&Mteepe growing aa the returns come in, and promises now to reach 40,000. Virr anxious hearts will thank God thia morning for the safety of the oyerdot steamer, City of Berlin. The BUI! Hen. The regular monthly meeting of the Western Nail Association takes place at Pittabargh to-morrow. The molt im? portent question to be submitted to the meeting is that looking to a curtailment of production. The first of January is close at hand and the trade la in a oondl* tlon of much uncertainty as to the future of prioes. Nails are now down to a point never reached before, not even io the darkest days following .the panic of 1867, and it aeems aa if some arrangement looking to curtailment of production is the only hope of the coming spring businesa. ^ Whin the grsin rate in New York gets up to forty oenta per cental, as it ii now, the Illinois Central and New Orleans route to Liverpool comes into play, This route will open in a fortnight, taking grain to Liverpool for 70 cento, the tame as is now charged by New York. This may prove a competitor during the win* ter with the longitudinal lines, and a valuable moderator of rates during the close season. The decline in Lake Shore is attributed somewhat to this cause, but we don't anticipate that it will rerolu< tionizn nnmnierp.t It it airnnlv *nniKa? reminder to (he Atlantic ports, and New York in particular, that their advantages are not aa fixed an the coaat line. Gov. Kkmpkr of Virginia, like Gov. Hampton of South Carolina, seems to be in advance of his party on the queatioo of public honeaty. He insist* that the state ia abundantly able to pay the inter* est on the public debt, and summarizes the whole initiation in the remark thai "the cheapest and easiest, aa well aa the only meana, of getting rid of a debt, ia to pay it off." _ How singular, that Mrs. Hayes, aa well as Mrs. Grant, should have "a very stub, born man" for a huaband 1 Bellaire Locals. ? The Murphy movement ia to be reinaugurBted in Bellaire. The lecture of Rev. Galchell at City Hall, on Sunday afternoon, waa the firat of a aerie* to be given by that gentleman and others. The second waa delivered at the M. E. Church last night, and the third will be given this evening. The enthusiasm does not begin to kindle, as it did last winter on the advent of Dunbar, Springer and company, however. The repairs on the ferryboat between here and Benwood are rapidly approaching completion. Foot pasnengera are carried in a skiff, while heavy luada and horsemen are obliged to go to Benson'* Ferry. 1 Another new house ia going up in Barnard'* last addition. ( Rev.

During the morning hour the resolutiou reported by Mr. Dorsey Instructing the Committee on District of Columbia to enquire and report by bill or otherwise the proper form of government for the District was agreed to. A number of bills were introduced aud referred! among them the following: Br Mr. Plumb: To declare certain lands heretofore granted railroad com* panics forfeited, and to open the same for settlement. By Mr. Johnston: Amendatory of and supplementary to the act to incorporate the Texas Pacific Railroad and to aid in its construction. At the expiration of the morning hour Mr. Wadleigb, chairman of the Committee of Privileges and Elections, culled up the resolution reported from that committee last week, declaring J. B. Eustis entitled to hia seat as Senator from Louisiana from January 12th, 1870. for the term ending March 3d, 1879, and Ingalls who signed the minority report, spoke in opposition to the resolution, claiming that the reports presented by Eustis were defective. After a brief discussion the resolution of Mr. Wadleigh waa agreed to?jean 29, nays 8. Those voting in the negative were Messrs. Allison. Cameron of Wis., Hamlin, Howe, Ingills, McMillan, Morrill and Saunders. On the announcement of the vote, Mr. Eustis was escorted to the desk of the Vice President by Mr. Thnrman and the oath of office was administered to him. Mr. McDonald, at his own request, was txcused from further service on the Committee on Territories, and Mr. Jones, of Florida, at his own request, was excused from further service on the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds. The Vice President appointed Mr. Etmtis a member of those committees. The Vice President then laid before the Senate the special order for to-day, being the bill to enable the Indiana to become citizens. Mr. Ingalls said he had been spoken to by several Senators who desired more liiue to consider, and he moved that it be made the special order for the 15th of January next, and it waa so ordered. Mr. McDonald aaid it had been his intention to ofTer resolutions in respect to :he memory and public services of his late colleague, Mr. Morton, before the Christmas holidays, but on consultation with other 8enators and various memta >f the other House, he had concluded not :o present such resolutions till after the recetu; he therefore, gave notice that he would submit them on the 17th of Januirv next. ;Ihe Vice President announced Messrs. Anthony, Sargent and Whyte as members d[ the joint committee on printing on the pari of the Senate. He also appointed Messrs. Cameron, of Pa., and Bayard, on the part of the Sen ite to attend the next examination at the West Point Military Academy. Mr. Cockerill, from the Select Committee on Mississippi levees, reported with amendments the House joint resolution in relation to reservoirs to promote the navigation of the Mississippi river. Placed on the calendar. Mr. Christiancy introduced a bill to provide for challenges to jurors in trials [or bigamy and polygamy in the territory of Utah, and to amend section 4 of the Act of June 24th. 1874, in relation to sourts and jadicial offices in that territory. Referred. Mr. Teller called up the resolution ubmitted by him last week, calling on the Secretary of the Interior for information regarding lands ceded to the United Slates by the confederated band of Ute Indians in Colorado, and whether payments are made to such Indians in pursuance of the agreement with them. Agreed to. Mr. Matthews then called up froift the table the concurrent resolution submitted bpr him on Thursday last, declaring the right of the government to pa? the nrin rtipal and interest of bonds lu silver'dollars containing 412J grains of standard stiver. Mr. Matthews uaid the General Assembly of Ohio, at its session last winter, adopted a resolution favoring the restoration of the silver dollar. This resolution was passed with great unanimity, there being but three negative vote# in the House and but one in the Senate, and he had no doubt but that it expressed the considerate and deliberate opinion of the ppople of that State on the subject with the same unanimity as was evidenced by their representatives in the passage of the resolution. He had been moved in part by that resolution to submit the one now before the Senate. -Though his resolution did not cover the whole ground of that* of the Ohio General Assembly, it expressed the opinion that auch a restoration of the silver dollar was demanded by true financial wisdom, and declared it to be in pursuance of a proper public policy to do bo. It was not hie purpose now to discnes the latter proposition, as to what would be expedient and politic for the government and people to do, but what would be right to do. in his opinion it would be right for the government to do so, and he used the word "right" in its legal, equitable Riut moral sense. It was bis purpose to* day to briefly show that by the letter and spirit of the law the government had the right to restore the silver dollar and would be justified in doing so, and further to show that outaide of the law. talcing In view all the circumstances of the cue, and every incident of financial legislation, that the restoration of the dollar would not be in violation of public honor, justice or public equity. lie then quoted from the act to strengthen the public credit, approved March 18, 1869, and argued that the word "coin" as used in this act must not be interpreted to refer to gold coin aiono. If it moat be so interpreted, then it would be just as dishonorable, just as illegal, to pay U. 8. Treasury notes now circulating as money in anvthing else but gold coin, as it would be to par bonds with any* thing but such coin. There were Senators here who were familiar with the circum* stances attending the peesafe of this law1 ?nd the history of legislation antecedenl to ill passage. The question that it wai designated to eolve vu not a doubtful one. The greenback* had been made a legal tender for *11 debt* and demands, public and private, except interest on the public debt and for cuatoma dutiee. The queition had therefore been agitated aato whether the principal of the debt might not be lawfully paid in greenbaoka, and to meet this question and to anawer it in the negative the publio oredit act of 1809 waa paused. In his opinion the orlgnal indebtednefM of the country could never have been liquidated with any other our* rency than coin dollara, it would have been aettled with mere promieea to pay in lieu of coin dollara. That aot waa in< tended to aettle any queation of paying the principal of theee bonda, and it diu aeem to him that if it had been contem* plated that theae bonds shonld be paid only in gold money it would have been ao ntuled; that in undertaking to aettle a doubt tbis statute would not nave raised a new one. The act of 1869 declared that the government would pay coin dollara, and what did coin mean at that dav? Nothing was coin in this country except that which by law might be coined as money, and there was on the statute books at that time another law which pre* scribed how many grains of gold tnere should be in gold coins,how many grains of silver in silver coin, and from the be* ginning of the Government down to that time the silver dollar was known to the people of the country as one of our coins. He next nuoted from the act of 1802, the 6th sec, of which provides that alldnties on imports should be parable in coin and ooin bo received should be set apart aa a special fund for certain purposes, etc., and argued that up to the act of 1873, whioh dropped the silver dollar from the coin of the United States, silver dollars were received for customs duties and were pledged for the payment of interest on the public debt fie next quoted from the act of July 14,1870, to authorize the refunding of the national debt and said it was intended to define with the utmost precision the medium for the redemption of those bonds. The measures of value of those bonds were most explicitly declared. Tliey were declared to be redeemable in coin of the present standard value and bearing inter* est payable semi-annually in such coin. There was no ambiguity about those times. There was no doubt about what those words mean't. The aot was as free from any possibility of doubt as words could make it. HOUSE. Under a call of Riates, the following bills were introduced and referred: By Mr. Joyce: Adjusting the salaries of Postmasters on the basis of the number of stamps cancelled, instead of the number sold; alto a * resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution, providing that the terra of the office of President be six years; also, a joint resolution in relation to the contest between Spain and Cuba. By Mr. Willis, of New York: Securing and extending the export trade of the United Stales; also, simplifying the existing laws empowering and collecting duties on imports, removing all ambiguities, reducing the rates on imported merchandise, restoring the duty on tea and coffee, and enlarging the free list. By Mr. Thompson: Directing the Secretary of the Interior to institute proceedings to test and perfect certain lands alleged to have been conditionally granted to the Northern Pacific Railroad. By Mr. Turner: For a tax on incomes; also, regulating the distillation of whisky from apples; also, reducing4the salaries of certain public officials. It provides for a reduction of 25 per cent of all salaries exceeding $1,800. By Mr. Chittenden: Appropriating $00,000 for the removal of snags from the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers. Rr Mp. Ron Prnnnnino- on aman<1 ment (o tbe Constitution providing. for the election of Senators by a direct vote of the people. By Mr. Giddings: For the construction of a railroad along the Bio Grande, for the purposo of establishing a military and commercial highway. By Mr. Kelley: A resolution amending the rules of the Honse so that it will only be in order to suspend the rules on the second and third Monday in each month and during the last six days of the session. Mr. Wood, chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means, reported the usual resolutions for distribution of the Freai* dent's annual message among the various committees. The subjects referred to the Committee 1 on Foreign Affairs sre, the war between Russia and Turkey, the reviewal of the treaty between the United States and Italy, questions as to naturalization and commerce of the United States and Germany, the French exhibition, extradition articles of the treaty of 1842 between the United Statex and Great Britain, the trea- , ty with Great Britain for the protection ol trademarks, recognition of President Diaz and difficulties on the Rio Grande border, insurrection in Cuba and interference therein with the rights of American citizens and other unsettled questions, Venezuela relations with Central and South America and proposed recog* tion of the government of the Samoan Islands. Mr. Hewitt, ofNew York, moved to amend the resolution in reference to the Committee on Foreign Affairs by adding to it the words, "and that the Committee on Foreign Affairs take into consideration tho beBt raeanB of removing the existing and impending causes of difficulty between Mexico and the United States, and of confirming and enlarging the com* mercial relations between the two countries by means of a treaty or otherwise, and have leave to report the result of its deliberations, by resolution or otherwise, to the House ht the earliest practicable day." He went on to say: "Thepeculiar language employed by the President in speaking of this matter attracted my attention when the message was read. I venture to call the attention of the House to the peculiar phraseology employed. It is as follows: "While I do not anticipate an inter* ruption of the friendly relations with Mexico, yet I cannot but look with solicitude upon a continuance of the border disturbances as exposing the twocountries to initiations of popular feeling and mis* chances of action, which are naturally on* i?ui?iis iw wuijncvo niuitfi rtroii/ determined nothing shall be wanting on my part to promote a good understanding between the nations, I mast auk the attention of Congress to the actual occurrences on the border, that the lives and property of our citizens may be adequate* ly protected and peaoe preserved." Mr. Hewitt, continuing, said this passage looks in two directions, Janus-like, either toward peace or toward war. and if by any possibility we should be plunged into hostilities with our neighbor.it will be alleged that Congress had notice and should have taken action In the premises. This consideration has induced me to examine with some care the message of the President, which was transmitted, to the House on the 18th of November, and which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs. The perusal of the doc* umenta accompanying that message will convince the House that our relations with Mexico are in a very critical etate. Already several detachments of troops, acting under orders of the President | transmitted to General Ord, have invaded Mexican territory against the protest of the de facto government of that country, which, although it hu been in ; power longer thin the present idministra i tion, has not yet been formally recognised I by our sovernmsnL Atthia preeentmo. > ment a detachment of American troop i , ie upon Mexican soil, but where, no oni i knows, and if it should turn out that ll has been captured or a conflict taken place between them and the Mexican troope, whereby blood hie been shed, it must be acknowledged that the dinger ol wir livery imminent if not unavoidable. 1 We oannot ihdt our eyes to these dingers. The country does not want a war. It de? eirea a time of reit to reoover from the louee of war. It deiiree an opportunity to strengthen itself to meet toe obligations whiou it h?a incurred during a long and destructive struggle. A new war will add to these obligations ind make the burden of debt and nretsurs of taxation intolerable. What the oountry deeiree is to make them leei and there is no method to reduce the burthens so effectually as to enlarge our trade with neighboring countries. Mexico offers s most inviting field as well an the neireet avenue of euch in extension of trade. Our people desire to cultivate peaceful relations with a customer so near and ao valuable, and all will agree that the establishment of better commercial relation will be the surest guarantee of peace. If i system of peaceful excharge of commodities on terms of re* ciprocity could be established along the borders of the RioQrande instead of the E resent system of riids and repriaals.! ostile collision* would soon be replaced by friendly competition? and angry re* criminations by kindly greetings. The Mexican question must be met and solved in some way, either by war, which no one desires, or by a protectorate, which haa been discussed and condemned by the general judgment of the country, or by cloeer commercial relation*, enlarging the ties of mutual interest and cementing natural harmony, which should exist between nationa producing product! ao dinsimilar aa to invite and compel etching" favorable to both. We have no right to take the risks of war when paths of pleasure are open to us. At leaat, as the stronger and older nation, we are bound by obvious considerations of magnanimitv to exhaust every effort toward a peaceful solution of the existing troubles, and a substitution through treaties of reciprocity of mutual interest lor the antagoniam of passion and plunder. The danger ia that, if this Congress should adjourn without deviling some peaceful solution, we may find ourselves, when we come back again, compelled to vote on questions of supply for military operations, which we could not refuse to make without imputation on our patriotism and public spirit. Mr. Hale?I hope the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Hewett)will be adopted. It is in the {right direction. The country does not want war on anj issue that haa been raised or that is likely to be raised. Mr. Reagan agreed that it was not well to invoke war, and it was the duty of the government, if a way waa open, to resort to peaceful modes and to improve the commercial and friendly relations of the United States and Mexico, rather than resort to anything looking to war. He said, however, that the existence oi what ia known as the "free zone" in Mexico waa an obstacle to commercial intercourse. Mr. Cox, of New York, lavored the amendment of Mr. 8tephens, and said : I have looked over this question of the border tronblea in Texas with deep interest. 1 believe the feeling pervades this whole community that if war can be prevented it ought to be. The Committee on Foreign Affaire may do much in counsel with the Executive to bring about some sort of negotiations. I am not prepared to say whether it is right to recog uiso me uo incio guvernmeni 01 xjihz; a am not sufficiently acquainted with the facts. Let the Committee on Foreign Affairs hare this matter specially and emphatically referred to it, and let the committee counsel with the Executive. I feel ansared that this administration is as much in favor of peace as the gentleman from New York, the gentleman from Maine, or seven-tenths of the Amerioui people. Let the Executive, however, be aided in its counsels by the wiadom of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Calhoun, as Secretary of War in 1817. to General Gaines to pursue the Seminole Indians into the Spanish territory, which order was vigorously carried out by Qen.^aines' successor, Gen.
