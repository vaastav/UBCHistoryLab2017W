Dealing; entirely with foreign relations and Amerl. ea's commercial progress in foreign trade, the message paved the way for others the chief executive will send later dealing with the biff questions of legislation and aovcrnment. A note of warning Jo power which by 'ndlrect mentis continue to discriminate '.Igainst American trade; a strong appeal to the congress to uplift the great for eign policies of America above mere questions of partisanship; a triumphant vindication of ho diplomacy of the ad ministration, which is characterized as that of "dollar versus bullet"; a masterful pride Jn the 'enormous expan sion of American trade as a result of the foreign policies of his administration, and an earnest appeal for Joint action by congress and the executive to open new markets for American industries these are the more striking features of tho message. Flrat of ui Merlon, I The message is tho first of a series of such communications which he will mako to congress in tho early days of the aeislon, and deals entirely with tho for eign relations of the United States. He ginning with the usual reference to the existing good relations with foreign powers, the president adds htat these have been strengthened by "A greater insistence upon justlco to American citizens, or interests, wherever It may have been denied, and a stronger Am phasis of the need of mutuality in com mercial and other relations." orjthe'' first" time In "Ha'tilstory, says the presidents the- State aepartmen't jms obtained substantially tho most favored nation treatment from all of the coun tries of the world. Therefore, he says that it Is only- natural that competitive countries should view with some con cern the expansion of our commerce. Hence the warning. "If In some In stances the measures taken by them to meet it are hot entirely equitable, a remedy should ba found." Recommends lietnllntion. To this end. the president strongly recommends the enactment of the bill recommended by Secretary Knox last December, permitting tho government, instead of Imposing the full maximum rates of duty agalnut discriminating countries, to apply a graduated scale of duties, up to that maximum of 15 par cent. "Mat tariffs are out of date," says the president. "Nations no longer accord equal tariff treatment to all other na tions, Irrespective of the treatment from them received. It Is very yieces Hary that the American government should be equipped with weapons of negotiation and adapted to modern economic conditions." The State department, "an archaic and Inadequate machine," at the beglnlng of this administration, the preseldent says, has become a new organization, with highly specialized bureaus and experts dealing with every phase of tAmerJcan trade and diplomacy. Holding that tluj. essence of this reorganized service Is found In the merit system. President Talft makes a strong appeal to congress o make this machine permanent, by giving the force of statutory law to the ex ecutive orders governing admission to and promotion In the diplomatic and con sular services. To show that these appointments are already largely nonpartisan, the president points to the fact that three of the present ambassadors are hold-overs; that of the ten he has appointed, five were by promotion from the rank of minister, that of the thirty ministers appointed, I'leven were promotions, and Hiat in the consular service no less than. 53 per cent of the "consuls appointed by him were from the southern states. "The diplomacy of the present uMmlnts. tration has sought to respond to modern deas of commercial Intercourse," says President Taft. "This policy has been "haracterlzed as substituting dollars for bullets. It Is one that appeals alike 'to deallastic humanitarian sentiments, to tie dictates of sound policy and strategy. nd to legitimate commercial aims." The president adds that "because mod rn diplomacy is commercial, there has been a disposition in some quarters to (Continued on Page Two.) ' The Weather. Forecast till 7 p. m.
