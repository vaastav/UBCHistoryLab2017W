The President's message waH delivered, and tomorrow- both houses v 111 enter upon "the regular business of the session, although little can be accomplished In the House until the committees have been appointed, If Speaker Henderson has not been engaged upon this work In advance of his election, which oc curred today, these announcements are not likely to be made until near the lime of the adjournment for the days. There Is nothing, however, frt.a l,itmntnn nf 1.111,9 n m .1 If Is mated that several thousand were Introduced and sent to the printer as soon ns the House of Representatives was organized. Very few of these will ever become laws, but there were bills inlroducd upon most subjects upon which Congress Is likely to act. In addition to the measures of highest Importance, strong efforts will be mndo to .secure changes In the bankruptcy law, the establishment of an executive department of commerce, and some geneiul law In regard to telegraphic ca bles. "Anti-fraud" legislation will be strongly pressed, especially with regard to the sale o oleomargarine nnd "shoddy woolens." A bill for a "reciprocity commission" was one of the measures Introduced yesterdny, which probably provides for a commission to study the subject for a few years and report upon It before action Is taken. Doubtless one of the first measuies of prime tnnce to be taken up will bo the agun canal bill, which the House may , , , . ' , , ., ,, .. ' be able to -Ret passed by the time the Senate hae acted on the treaty. ably. In view of the decision of the Su- preme Court Just rendered, legislation affecting trade with the I'lilllpplnes may be pressed. At any rate, there are many important subjects to be dealt with.

It hhould be his province to de.il with commerce In Its broadest sense. ntrfontr nrinv other thlntr.s. w hut- ever concerns labor and all matters reeling tne great nuslness corporations and our merchant marine. Taking up tho matter of labor the pres ident says every effort must he bent to tin? uniintcnancH of tho high standard ot American labor, and the protection of the laborer not only through the tariff, but against tho coming In of laborers un der contract, nnd adds: I "Or ot those who, coming freely, yet represent a standard of living so depressed that they can undersell our men ln tho labor market and drag them to a lower level. I regard It as nccessan. with this end in view, re re-enact Immediately tho law excluding Chinese libel era and to strengthen it wherever necessary In order to make Its enforcement entirely effective." He recommends national act'ou which 1 win renner enectlvo the efrorts or thn mates to 110 away with convict labor competition, ror the eight hour day, for the protection of women and chlldien who nro employed, and for the provision that all government work shall be done uiiuer iiur coiiciuions. ji communas ",l iit"'n y no means limited metjy labor organizations, nnd says tliero must to ,ts mati riiil effi cts upon our busWiess b protection for all.

First, wo should aim to exclude absolutely not only all persons who aro known to be be. lievers In anaichlstlc principles, but also all persons who are of a low moral tlency or of unsavory reputation. ! Thu second object of a proper J tlon law ought to be to secure by a care ful and not merely perfunctory educational test some Intelligent capacity to appreciate American Institutions and net iancly an American citizens. Finally, all persons should be excluded who are below 11 certain standard of economic fitness to enter our lndutilitl field as competitors with Amerlcin labor Thu protective policy, the president .says, has general acquiescence, and it would, be unwise to dlstuib business Interests 1 by tariff changes. The president advocates reciprocity, where tho products or tne country no longer need the sup- Iiort once given, but says there should be nuiiiniK uuue which wouiu anect lalior or homo Industries. He advocates the treaties in bo far as they will promote good feeling and furnish wider markets In relation to the merchant marine, the message calls attention to tho Inequalities of the rates of pay of American seamea and foreigners and tho expanse of running tho ships, as well un the fact that the competing carriers aro subsidized, and urges action which will remedy the Inequalities. The president commends tho act fixing 1 tho geld standard, and recommends l ther legislation tending to strengthen tins credit of tho country, to sifegu.ird ngalnst financial crises and to mike the currency reaponslvu to the demands of trade.
