Official Paper of County. ,T OUR 'IN I 1900 Needless Alarm. It is beooiniining apparent that eastern newspapers have entered upon a campaign of falsification and slander for the purpose of injuring Kansas, Nebraska, and some other western states! The east will learn before going a great ways in this di rection that in a business and indus trial way the west is likely to stand together. There are seaports besides New York, and transfer points besides Chicago.—Cedar Rapids Gazette. The lluaucial press of the east pre tend to be greatly alarmed over the bimetallic victories in Kansas aud Nebraska and over the growing strength of bimetallism through out the west as well as in the refusal of Colorado to issue bonds to up take the "excess warrants." In Iowa these "excesss warrants" are represented in warrants issued for the ordinary current expenditures of the the government aggregating $750,000. These warrants when pre sented for payment are stamped "not paid for wuut of funds" and the date of presentation noted from which date they bear the legal rate of inter est of the state aud are as safe as a bond of the state the difference be ing that when taxes are paid the state will pay, and the interest will cease though the owner of the warrants would like the money to remain in vested for a series of years accepting the state as a debtor. The financial press of the east is giving place to all kinds of rumors about unfavorable financial legisla tion and to impre3sive threats that no cupital will bo invested in the states which have defied dictation of Wall street iuiluence. The alarm is needless so far as unfavorable legis lation is concerned. No laws will be passed in any western state that is either unfair or dishonest. Capital is as safe invested in any western state as if invested in any of the eastern state, has always been so, and will always so retnaiu. Threats are idle and can safely be disregarded. Money will always go where money is to be made. If there is profit in the industries and pro ducts of any state or people there money will go for investment in busi ness or in loans to'those engaged in its development. There will le little or no money however plentiful for in vestment IU industries which fail to pay dividends to those conducting them, aud interest to those who fun ish the capita) to prosecute them This is as true of the east as ot tht west.

There are millions of capital iu this country locked up aud afraid of in vestment because of the continued deprecation of property and of all the products of labor. This accounts for the investment of millions cf American capital iu Mexioau indust ries and enterprises where reasonable profits are assured. Necessity of Figuring. A great majority of our North western farmers have only a vague idea of the costs and returns of tiiei yearly labor. Few there arc who take advantage of an idle hour to do some figuring to find out what a given field has done in the way of profits, or if it has not failed to give any reward for its tillage. We have often thought that the struggle of our writers upon farming, and the men who are en ideavoring to educate aud bring into praotical existence a better class of tillers, might be materially aided if the farmer could be induced to do little less dogged labor aud spend little more time '"figuring." The se lection of a crop for afield is very im portant matter. It should be long considered beforehand and no mis takes made. What would become of a merchant who started up his store v. with goods that were not in demand in his locality? If a country dealer shelves high with costly silks and satins, instead of calicos and ginghams, his farmer patrons would be the first to see the mistake he had made, and mark him down as a man who had a "lot to learn" be fore he could run a country store. piled his H" Many do not stop to consider what their fields are best suited to raise, what the probable result may be, and often sow whatever may happen to be handiest to use when the time tomes. But now that the terrible shrinkage of value of farm products and soarcity of money makes it al most a battle for life to attempt to farm for a living, it behooves our farmers to consider well what they do, and try to calculate the chances.' —Farm, Stook and Home. .. SANGER IN SODA. Serious Results Sometimes Follow Its Exoessive Use. Common soda is all right In its place and indispensible in the kitchen and for cooking and washing pur poses, but it was never intended for a medicine, and people who use it as suoh will some day regret it. We refer to the common use of soda to relieve heartburn or soar stomach a habit which thousands of people practice almost daily, and one which is fraught with danger .moreover the soda only gives temporary relief and in the end the stomach trouble gets worse and worse. The soda acts as a mechanical irri tant to the walls of the stomach and bowels and oases are on record where it accumulated in the intestines, causing death by inflammation or peritonitis. Dr. Harlandson recommends as the safest and surest cure for sour stom aoh (acid dyspepsia) an excellent pre paration sold by druggists under the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. These tablets are large 20 grain.lozen ges very pleasant to taste aud contain the natural acids, peptones, and di gestive elements essential to good digestion, and when taken after meals they digest the tood perfectly and promptly before it has time to fermont, sour aud poison the blood and nervous system. Dr. Wuerth states that he invari ably users Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets in all cases of stomach derangements and finds them a certain cure not only for sour stomach, but by promptly digesting the food they create a healthy appetite, increase flesh and strengthen the action of the heart and liver. They are not a ca thartic, but intended only for stom ach diseases and weakness and will be found reliable in any stomach trouble except cancer of the stomach. All druggists sell Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at 50 cents per package.

Ryan, of the Metropolitan Traction company, is credited with the authorship of thq plan. According to the traction employes, he is going around among the directors of the various corporations, suggesting that they all agree not to employ men discharged by any corporation in the combine. The blacklist is supposed to be aimed at dishonest conductors or offensively vigorous strikers. If it ia adopted the names of discharged em ployes will be issued in the form of a cir cular, weekly or monthly, and distrib uted among the corporations. To guard against the possibility of a discharged man giving an assumed name—which is now against the law there will also be a regular Bertillon re port of complexion, measurements, marks, etc. In this way the traction companies hope to keep their pay-rolls uncontaminated. Of course, the agree ment, when made, will be secret, but the companies credited with looking fa vorably on the scheme are the Consoli dated Traction company, of New Jer sey the Metropolitan, of New York the Brooklyn Heights, the Pittsburgh road, Baltimore City railroad, Philadel phia Traction company, Albany City company. Union railway of New York, and the Yerkes roads of Chicago. Drown His Cries.

Much Space Devoted to the Financial Question—Necessity for Our rency Reform. Washington, Dec. 7.—The following Is th« text ot President Cleveland's message to congress: To the Congress of the United States: As representatives of the people In tl eglslatlve branch of their government: have assembled at a time when buttons and the when \£e strength and excellence of our free lnsti of our citizens ti been again madi „tness popular rule have political manifest. A political contest involvln| momentous consequences, fraught wit The Turkish Question. At the outset of a reference to the more lis important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers, it would lsfaotlon if I could ._ .. gri with foreign powers, it would afford me sat assure the congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic T] key had less hi ur during the past year assumed a hideous and bloody aspect, and that of decisive action on the paA of the great nations having the right ly treaty to in terfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a soft ened disposition or protective intervention, we have been afnfeted by continued aid not unfrequent reports of the wanton de struction of homes and the bloody butoh ery of men, women and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith Protection ot Americans. While none of our citizens In Turkey d. none have thus far been killed or wounded though often In the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety In the fu ture is by no means assured. Our govern ment at home and our minister at Con stantinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman terrl ory, who constitute nearly all the Individ uals residing there who nave a right to claim our protection on the score of Amer ican citizenship. Cuban Insurrection. The insurrection in Cuba BtlU continues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to ercclve that any progress has thus far jeen made towards the pacification of the island, or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least Improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the con siderable towns, the Insurgents still roam it will over at least two-tnlrds of the in land country. If the determination of Spain to put down the lnsurrecion seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and Is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely Increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason ti believe that the insurgents have galnei in point of numbers ana character and re sources, and are none the less Inflexible In their resolve not to succumb without prac tically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. Not Yet Entitled to Recognition. If Spain has not yet reestablished her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the con test has gone on, the pretense that civil :overnment exists on the Island, except so 'ar as Spain is able to maintain It, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less Imperfectly, In the large towns and their Immediate suburbs. But, that excep tion being made, tho entire country is either given over to anarchy or Is Bubject to the military occupation of one or the other party. Why Spain Does Not Win. Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists In the open, or In pitched battle, prompt and declBfve results might Ve looked for, and the Immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, dis cipline, and equipment, could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. Situation Deplorable. Meanwhile, as In all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of the combatants prow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and Eited ore deplorable. They are also partlol In Dy bands of marauders, who, now the name of one party and now in tho name of the other, as may best suit tho occasion, harry the country at will and plunder its wretched Inhabitants for their Own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail Immense destruction of property, even if It were the policy of both parties to prevent it as lar as prac ticable. But while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish government, it has now apparently abandoned acting upon the same theory aB surgents, namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihila tion of property that it may not prove of use and advantage to the enemy. It Is to the same end that In pursuance of general orders, Spanish garrisons are now befnp withdrawn from plantations and the rura opulatlon required to concentrate itself the towns. fn Would Eugage Our Serious Attention. The spectucle of utter ruin of an adjoin ing country, by nature one of the moBt fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious attention of the gov' crnment and the people of the United States in any circumstance, in point of fact, they have a concern with it which in by no means of a wholly sentlmenta or phllantnroplc character. It lies so near to UB as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary Interest lr (t Ts second only to that of t! government of Spain. Vexatious Entanglements. Besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds Itself inextricably Involved In the present contest In other ways both vex atious and costly. Many Cubans reside in this country and Indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by publlo meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, By the raising of funds and by other means, which the spirit of our institution and the tenor of our laws do not perm to be made the subject of criminal prosecu tions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citi zens of the United States, a proceeding re sorted to with a view to possible protec tion by this government, and not unnat urally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin. Tho 'juotlou of intervention, These Inevitable entanglements of inere were any- evidence oi a uenrre u. willingness on the part of Spain to enter tain such a proposal. It is urged, finally, that, all other methods failing, the existing Internecine strife in Cuba snould be ter minated by our intervention, even at the cost of a war between the United States and Spain—a war which its advocates con fidently prophesy could be neither large Its proportions nor doubtful In its issue. Right, Mot Might, Mast Rule. The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The united States has nevertheless a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dic tates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nations. ipts fri 1,584,537: 91. people anc. It is reasonably, eg bly tlmated that at leaBt from {30,000,000 .. $50,000,000 of American capital are Invested in plantations, and in railroad, mining and other business enterprises on tho Island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which In 188 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in i89 to about $108,000,000, and in 1894, the Vear before the present Insurrection broke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. ths United Slates with tho rebellion In Cuba, the large American property Interests af fected and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general have led to a ve hement demand in various quarters for Homo sort of positive Intervention on the part of the United StateB. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded to,the insurgents—a propo sition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation clearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the Independence of the Insurgents But Imperfect and nlsh governme no other exists there- should be recognized. restricted as the Spanish government of the Island may be. unless the will of tho military officer in temporary command of a particular dis trict can be dignified as a species of gov ernment.

When we consider these Incidents and contemplate the peace ful obedience and manly submission whloh lave succeeded a heated clash of political opinions, we discover abundant evldenoe of a determination on the part of our coun trymen to abide by every verdict of the lopular will and to be controlled at all lines by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the af fairs of their government. pon neigh- Spain Should Grant Autonomy. It Is ill the assumed temper and dispo sition of the Spanish government to rem edy these grievances, fortified by indica tions of influential publlo opinion in Spain, that this government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife, with honor and advantage to. Spain and with tho it of all achievement .... the insurrection. Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy—a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, vould satisfy all rational requirements ot ler Spanish subjects—there should be no ust reason why the pacification of the sland might not be effected on that basis. the reasonable objects It would seem that Objections Answered. It has been objected on the one side that 3paln should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms on the other side, that promised au tonomy, however liberal, is Insufficient, be cause without assurance of the promise be fulfilled, but the reasonableness of a re rement by Spain, of unconditional sur ender on the part of the Insurgent Cubans oefore their autonomy Is conceeded, is net altogether apparent. It Ignores important features of the situation—the stability of two years' duration has given to the in surrection the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the nature of IhlnRS, and as shown by past experience, the ltter and imminent ruin of the island, un less the present strife is speedily composed above all, the rank abuses whloh all par ties in Spain, all branches of her govern ment and all her leading publlo men con cede to exist and profess a desire to re move. Facing such circumstances to with hold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put them selves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance ot neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as the sincerity of any professed willingness 3 grant reforms. The objeotlon on behalf of the insurgents —that proposed reforms cannot be relied upon—must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain under takes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking. Offered Our Services. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weak er of two combatants are always natural and not always unjustifiable—being sin cerely desirous in the interest of both, as well as on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solved with tho least possible delay. It was Intimated by thlu jovernment to the government of Spain tome months ago that, if a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents, and would be accepted them upon a guaranty of its exeoution. United States would endeavor to find way not objectionable to Spain of fur- a believed to be not altogether unwelcome. A Limit to Our Patience. Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our Interests would eonstraln us to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference with Its control by any other power. It should be added that it cannot be reasonably assumed that tho hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due re spect to the sovereignty of Spain, we can-, not view the pending conflict in all Its features and properly apprehend our in evitably close relations to it and Its pos sible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn Into such an unusual and unprecedented con dition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and In her own way, or with our friendly cooperation. Deferring the choice of ways and meth ods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the pre cise conditions then existing and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration nvolvlng our honor and interest, ot the nternatlonal duty we owe to Spain.
