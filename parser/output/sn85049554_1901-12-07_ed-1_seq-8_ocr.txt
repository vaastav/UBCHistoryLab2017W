Price Reaches 83 Cents and Closes Near Top-Corn Follows Wheat. Chicago, Dec. 7.—Speculation on the board of trade was on a rampage again today, record prices in all grains \vero topped an*d bull enthusiasm ran from pi to pit, setting all traders in a fever of excitement. The conditions back of tho upward whirl of prices were almost iden­ tical with those that started the bull movement Wednesday .and Thursday Country orders, especially for wheat, deluged the commission, houses before trade Opened. Added to this big demand, however, was a pew and powerful bull incentive, that of capitalistic specula tion. Prominent brokers say the coun try has gone speculation mad and men who usually dabble in fitocks are turn ing to grain. The news today was bull ish. Both Liverpool and the Englis'a country markets were strong, outside American markets were bullish and re ceipts reported rapidly falling off. Wheat opened of a cent to 1% cents higher and prices were well maintained. De cember ranged between 7696 and 78%, and May between 80?i and 83. Corn and oats, tho both excelling the records for many years, followed largely after the lead of wheat. The cash situs lion in both of these cereals was very strong and the supply limited. Chicago, Dec. 7.—A whirlwind of ex citement struck the grain pits today and sent all cereals again above record prices. After yesterday's early dullneia and late reviving strength shorts were panicky. The conditions were the san that started the big bull movement of Wednesday and Thursday. Buying or ders are coming in on till sides. Wheat had a greater part of the attention of trader?. Commission houses bought heavily and offerings were very light. December opened %®7A. of a cent to ltt @1% cents higher at 77:& to 76%. Proflt taking by the big professionals was popular and prices sagged to 76%. The big country demand, however, kept the tone very strong. May opened %@l to 1%@1% cents higher at 80% to 81%, tx ceeding the record price for this crop by of a cent. Profit taking in this op tion also brought a sag to 80%, but the reaction was quick and at the end of the first hour it was holding strongly at 81. General conditions had little effect on the pit, speculation ruling. Cables snd English country markets were strong, as were outside markets here. Small primary receipts, Wall street buying and the generaL rush to get hold of wheat, brought prizes upward after a small sag with a rush. December closed 2%@2% higher at 78% May jumped excitedly to 83 and closed strong 2% up at 82%@82%. Trade in corn was not very large. Commission houses had good buying or ders, cable* were strong and there 'vas very little for sale. Sympathy with wheat was the strong est factor, tho outsicle markets vere much higher than Chicago. Cash de mand was 6trong. Unsettled' weaiher also was so'me influence. December opened to 1@1% up at 65%@6596 to 65H. but eased on liquidation to it4%. May struck its new record price at the start, opening to 1 up at 68% to (8%. There was a slight wag here also, but holdings were firm at 6S%. Corn felt the onward rush in wheat and followed It in a measure. December closed higher at 64%, strong but somewhat less so than at the opening. May jumped up to a saill higher record and closed there strong, 1% higher at 69. Oats opened strong at record break ing prices, more in sympathy with other grains. There was a fair commission house trade, which developed strongly. May opened to 1 higher at 46 to 46% There was a range oif rapid fluctuations, but the option held very strong at 46%. Cash demand was good and acceptance short. Provisions opened somewhat dull at lower prices all arcund on the weaker hog market. Chioapo Produoa. Chicago, Dec. 7.

Special to Times-Republican. Des Moines, Dec. 6.—The Iowa crops in this year 1901 are worth millions to the Iowa people. The cold figures for it are furnished by the Iowa weather and crop service. In four of the years of the past decade Iowa actually had a smaller crop than this year, so that in quantity the crop is not as poor as sup posed. But never is the history of the state have the products of the soil been as valuable as now. The crop sum mary as made out by John, R. Sage, of the weather and crop bureau, shows that despite the extreme heat arid drouth of the midsummer period, the harvests have amply rewarded tho far mers of this state. Wheat—The area of winter wheat was 49,068 acres, and the total yield 865,770 bushels, or an average of 17.6 bushels per acre. Spring wheat yield is I7,42i? 230 bushels-^an average of 15.3 bushels per acre. Total wheat product 18,295, 000 bushels—a loss of 2,983,350 bushels compared with last year on account of decreased acreage. The average farm price is about 60 cents per bushel. Corn—The reports show unusual var iableness in the averages of the corn crop, in the different counties, ranging from 18 to 38 bushels per acre, as the result of unequal distribution of rain fall in the critical stage of growth. The general state average is 26.2 bushels per acre, and the total product 227,908,850 bushels, harvested from 8,687,480 acres. The total output of 1901 Is about 65 per cent, compared with the crop cf 1900 and about 85 per cent compared with the average product of the past twelve seasons. The average farm price of corn for the state is about 50 cents per bushel, as against 27 cents on Decem ber 1, 1900. The cash value of the crop In the markets is about $113,000,000, or $20,000,000 in excess of the value cf the crop last year on the basis of prices ob tainable December 1. In this estimate no account is made of the Increment in value resulting from feeding corn on the farms where it is produced. Oats—The area of oats harvested this year was 3,799,229 acres, which Is 192,- Crops. From the above conservative estimate it appears that the soil products of this state, at current farm prices, in this droughty season, are worth over $27'4, 000,000, which sum is about $44,000,000 In A Good Cough Medicine. [From- the Gazette, Toowoomba, Australia.] I find Chamberlain's Cough Remedy is an excellent medicine. I have been suffering from a severe cough for the last two months, and it has effected a cure.

Denmark, la., Dec. 7.—Deacon Theron Trowbridge celebrated his eighty-sixth birthday yesterday, and his many friends gave him a surprise In the evening by gathering at the Congrega tional church and bringing with thern many tokens of their love and respect for his faithfulness as a Christian citi zen for the many years he has lived in the community. For more than' fifty years Mr. Trowbridge has been the faithful sexton of the Congregational church. Rev. J. M. Cummings, in a few well chosen words, presented the gifts to Mr. Trowbridge, who was so overcome with surprise and joy that words failed him to express his gratitude to his friends for their love and generosity. Altho Mr. Trowbridge is eighty-six years old, he is hale and hearty, and only a few weeks ago walked out from Ft.
