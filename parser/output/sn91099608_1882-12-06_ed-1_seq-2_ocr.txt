The New York Commercial says it is reported that Porter has sold all bis Omaha holdings and thatVanderbilt has bought them. The friends of Oen. Terry are begin ning to gather at Washington, audit is no seeret that General Pope's confirma tion will not have a smooth road through the senate. President Arthur has appointed and commissioned Clayton McMiohael of Philadelphia United States marshal for the Distriot of Columbia. MoMichael is editor and proprietor of the Philadelphia -North America. kr 1 tt SeDator Van Wyok, of Nebraska, says there is no doubt whatever of tbe elec tion of a republican senator to succeed m' *K Saunders that most of the members -1 eleoted to the legislature as anti-monop olists are republicans. A number of Chicago railroad mana gers interviewed on the position of Pres ident Porter of the Omaha line say the question of territory belonging to the .various roads and not to be built into by others must be decided, are about evenly divided, half agreeing and the other half disagreeing with him. Owing to land frauds of a startling .- magnitude in connection with the Osage Indian lands in Kansas, the commission er of the general land office has issued an order suspending all cash entries made by sisglo men since June 23d, 1881, where tho lands lie within the counties of Sumner, Harper, King andComanohe. A Cairo telegram of tbe 3d says Arabi Pashn that morning pleaded guilty to the chaige of rebellion. In the after noon the court ^martial reassembled and pronounced a sentenco of death. The khedive commuted the sentence to exile for life. It is believed Ar&bi will retire to some part of the British dominions. His demeanor before the court was very dignified. It is announced in Chicago that the Illinois Central railroad will make a freight rate of 15 oents per 100, regard less of classification, lrom Chicago to Omaha, to correspond with the rate from Omaha to Chicago, unless the warring roads in the northwest at once restore rates between Chicago and Sioux City. That they will do this is considered im probable. The proposed cut by tbe Illi nois Central would involve the Iowa pool lines generally, it is believed. The report of the tariff commission says substantially that the reduction of the tariff has been aimed at. The aver age reduction of rates, including that from the free lists and the abolition of tho duties on charges and commissions, is twenty to twenty-five per cent. The reduotion in many cases has been forty five to fifty per oent. If the reduction is as large as the commission expected, and if the opponents of the present economic system say truly that the duty on manu facture aud agricultural products en hances prices to consumers on what is imported, and also on domestic produc tions, their reduction will benefit con cumers to the extent of $100,000,000. The physicians who attended the hile President Garfield are not backward in expressing their dissatisfaction at the award of the board of audit. Dr. Bliss said Sunday that he had not conferred with his brethren who were assistants with him in the case, and thereforo could not say what their intentions were. For himself he wanted it distinctly under stood that he would not enter suit against the estate for the balanee of his account, nor would he go to congress for relief by bill or otherwise, He would not under take a law suit, as he had not the time to devote to such business, and besides he thought that he had done what was proper and expected of him by present ing his bill to the board of audit. He would not undertake to say tbat the other doctors would not petition congress for redress, but such a measure would not find favor with him. Mrs. Coggins announces her annnal display of millinery and fancy articles for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday of this week, and all aro invited when on their way from the "Art Loan" to call in and see the fine and unusually large as sortment of holiday and fancy goods now on Exhibition at her establishment.
