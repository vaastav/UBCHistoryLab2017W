WHARF PILIKIA TWalk-Over Shoes L. B. KERR & CO., LTD. Sole Agents. Alakea Street. Honolulu. COVERING OF NEW PILES AT BREWER'S WHARF IS FOUND DEFECTIVE. The protecting metal sheeting on tho piles of the now Brower's wharf will ultimately have to be replaced al most entirely In order to protect tho structure from tho ravages of the toredo. At the present tlmo divers are at work replacing the metal on many ot the piles, and reports are to tho effect that a large proportion of tnetn aro defective. Tho metal with whlcn they were covered at tho tlmci they were put in only a year or so ago, has become (or always was) so brittle that It Is break ing away from tho wood, making It Imperative that no time bo lost In re pairing the damage If tho splendid wharf Is to bo saved. No ono connected with the Public Works Department will hazard any guess as to tho ultlmato cost which this kind of repairing will entail, but outsiders havo placed tho amount at trom $5000 to $10,000. Tho discovery of tho condition of tho piling Is not new except perhaps to tho general public. It was known that the sheotlug was not what It should bo beforo tho wharf was com pleted or taken off tho contractors' hands. Some kind of a compromise was effected, It Is understood, at tho tlmo this condition first became mani fest, by which somo robato was mado to tho contracting firm of Lord & Bol ser through Hackfold & Co., and tho Pacific Hardware Company through whom tho motal was purchased. It Is stated by waterfrontors that thero la not another structure on tho watorfront In which such trouble with the sheeting has occurred. Just what tho composition is which was used Is not known, other than as "yellow metal." There Is no question that It Is something very inferior for tho purposo for which It was put.
