DANIEL LOGAN EDITOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 8, 1910 THE EQUATORIAL MUDDLE. It is interesting, in view of the news of hostilities between Peru and Bolivia on the boundary question, to note the reccipt-by last mail of a pamphlet giving a resume of the boundary controversy between Ecuador and Peru. It was written by Alfredo Florcs y Caaniano, first secre tary to the legation of Ecuador in Washington, for the information ot the press of the United States. - Fourteen pages of argument, citing his tory and treaties, concludes with these omnious words: "Ecuador, for the sake of humanity, earnestly desires peace and exerts all legitimate efforts in order to preserve it unaltered; but, in the case of a just war of recovery, the blame for bloodshed shall not fall upon it." Why. in the name of civilization the question naturally occurs do. not these little countries at t'nc equator come-together in a peaceable fe deration? Why should they have boundaries, at least other than as local self-goveriimg states of one commonwealth, capable of becoming a "reat nation? With the resplendent examples of the United States, Gennany, Canada, Australia and South Africa all within a period long succeeding the European colonization of South and Central America before their eyes, it might be imagined that these Latin peoples should bv now have acquired some degree of world-sense. The time is com- ing when the United states wm icci cancu uijuu, i am- aiauu; es the power, to put an end to fiatricidal nonsense among air of her southern neighbors. 'Local capitalists who have started cqcoanut plantations here are like ly to have a good thing, if they persevere in the enterprise. , .There would seem to be a boom in copra just now, m the European market, which almost rivals the recent furore in rubber. Probably the demand for copra will be more steadfast irt relation to the supply than that for rubber, as the regions where the cocoanut will flourish are likely not comparable in Vastness with congenial habitats of the rubber tree. At, all events, cocoanut lands in the South Seas have taken a tremendous jump in value, and Fiji anticipates that its sugar w.ill be supplanted by its copra industry. Mr. Parsons, a New York democrat of prominence, is quoted in a London interview; for sensible remarks on the elections at home; His deprecation of further piling up of legislation, while existing statutes are' on trial arid public" opinion is much confused on important pending questions, will be echoed by the common-sense of the nation. It is 'in teresting to haye such views from a democratic politician antedating President Taft's message with which they prove to be harmonious. .- Secretary Wilson believes that the yield of sugar beets to the acre fcan be doubled, and that when that condition is reached the United States will not require to import any sugar. Even if such a tune should arrive, it will not necessarily meah the extinction of the American cane. Si-ear industry. Prices will still govern the amount of sugar, beet plantingand sugar-is a commodity that must always hold an equable j-atio of prices with other foodstuffs. v f Judge Cooper lias taken the right stand -with regard to offenses acainst women, in declining to ratify compacts of leniency between pro secuting ,and defending lawyers. In the absence of law to provide re lief for the innocent dependents, .of culprits, such as is being advocated now by some prison reformers, sympathy for sueh unfortunate persons must not be allowed to defeat the ends of justice. j Mr. Macfarlane's suggestion that artists should be among the Floral, Parade judges is worthy of attention. There is considerable chance of wrone selections being made when outsiders are appointed. All strang ers are not necessarily angels and possibly not every angel is a con noisseur in matters of taste. It appears to be as hard to obtain good men for the federal supreme bench as it is, when vacancies occur, for the supreine bench of Hawaii. There is no word as yet of calling on the, national bar association by President Taft to make the selections for him. - Mr. Thurston and others, at the Hilo public meeting' reported bv telecranh, take the same view as The Star has done about important athendments of the Organic Act. They snould be submitted to the legis lature befoce being promoted in Washington. Ta'coma has taken a radical step against saloon evils by adopting an ordinance to prohibit treating. There is no doubt that treating is res ponsible -for the major amount'of excess, m the conventional sense of the ferm, which prevails, among users of stimulants. 'Mr. Keefc may have difficulty in locating any federation of labor in 'Hawaii. If there is such an organization it has not made a noise like aay thing alive since anybody can remember. , j-Iilo is showing a public spirit of metropolitan size in guaranteeing a subsidy of $5000 a year for a federal experiment farm in its neighbor hood. , Queensland this year has a crop of cane sugar which has gone far above the estimate. The fact is evidence of the success of cane sugar raising by white farmers upon small holdings in that country. The Mexican revolt does not stay suppressed any longer than the" news about it. m "&--i-gfcg- gMM5 features of the new program and in this screamingly funny farce tftoso laugh provoking. German comedians, Rowe und ilorigrief, have some excel lent work cut out for them. Vernet Hughes, the charming soubrette, who sang nnd acted herself into the hearts of Bijou patrons right off the reelwlH Introduce some more of her clover work tonight Richard Kipling will offer some of his latest mainland hits. In the vaudeville program some pleasing items are promised, Walter Perry, who makes people laugh in spite of themselves lias a whole sleevo full of now parodies and Jokes" that he will expose while Gladys Mld- dleton promises a turn tnat will make her sensational net of tlio first of tho week look very ordinary. Dunn and IJrnnton, tho eccentric dancers will Introduce hnother novelty act nnd that they will mnko good goes without Fiiylni?. Director Hughes lias arrang ed a lot of new music andj.no motion picture operator promises some sub jects that nro entirely new hero. If tho bill stacks ;i as well ns that ot tho flrst'part of tho week business at the Dljou for the week end gives evcty Indication or uelng oven better than the openlu. 

ARTISTS FOR PARK. Mnnager Congdon m pursuance of his laudablo efforts always to get something good for the numerous pat rons of the Park Theater, has Btruck an entirely new chord by securing for a short season tho three Modores. Every member of the team is a stur, and something decidedly novel Is pro mised. They nre sketch artists df a high-class; their turn is a thoroughly refined one, and Manager Coijgdon Is certain that it will hit the popular taste. Tho Medorns appear first In a bicycle comedy sketch that is original and clever, and at the conclusion of the turn Mr. Medora will turn out an oil painting five five feet by four in tho remarkably rapid time of eighty seconds. Sandarie, the third member of the team, as her name implies, Is a sand artist. She has a large col lection of colored sands, and in an incredibly short space of time, she has some beautiful pictures worked cut. As she finishes each picture, a jolt of the frame leaves by a mass ot colored sands and a feeling of disappointment that the . picture should have been so ruthlessly de stroyed. Tho Melnotte Sisters are still In the bill, and tonight they will present a change of program. 

SAVOY GETS JOHNSON. The Savoy theater Is Tortunate for tonight and for Jhe balance of the week to be able to present Jack John son to its natrons. That is "Tho Ar rival of Jack Johnson' is the title of a jtarco (sketch which the Malan Magarth Company will put on to night, in whlc,h Jim McGarth will play the role of Jack Johnson. Ma grath Is a premier in darkey imper sonations. In fact he seldom appears In any but darkey roles and his sal lies of wit are laugh-makers. His make-up causes a ripple of laughter all over the house and he keeps the audience In smiles continually. Malan, who has been impersonating a broken down tragedian of the comic-paper make-up, wil have, an evcel lent role as a support to Jack Johnson, while Nellie Howard and Dot Raymond, supply the femi nine features. Dot .Raymond, will also sing new songs, and In her" selec-." tions for the week-end she has some which bring her baby-drawl to the front to the best advantage. (The Savoy management, which has secured management also of the Em pire theater'' has ''closed the latter house for ten .days to make altera tions and change tho appearance of the entrance, has cabled to San Fran cisco ior new uuent, , wnicn may ar rive on the Lurllne, to reopen the re modelled Empire.
