It appears that the bulk of our Congressmen began to prepare for Slave emancipation, before they had taken their seats in the Hall of Legislation. Well, if these peacemaking and peace-loving rep resentatives are to have their way, wo must submit to have a rev state of thinrs in America. Wc b?g to turn the whole of the learn ed motions of Monday last, being the 2d dav of December. 1801, into one new. logical, and sublime syllogism. Thus : Slavery is the greatest crime under heaven, the slaves of all rebels shall bo pro- ciaimcu irec, dui mo staves Union men shall remain in their bondage ; therefore, wc shall help tiie rebels to rid themselves of sin, but our real friends, the Union men, shall remain sinning slaveholders. It thus appears that rebels shall not be allowed to hold on in their sins, but must become pure and clean, while our sincere and true Union friends shall permitted to hold on in committing the greatest crime under heaven; and if their slaves should run away, the willing and wealthy workmr c asses ot America more than willing to pay a full compensation ! ! ! The Eaton and Preble County Papers. The Republican-Abolition party is fully represented in the Register, as the hold and avowed advocate of placing firearms in the handsof 1 """o the slaves of those who arc called rebels, to gain their freedom through slaughter and death; as there is a very largo number Preble who arc iu earnest in their efforts to achieve slave emancipa tion by means of the present war, it is their duty to support their political creed, by reading their own paper. Wc, of the Democratic school American politicians, have creed, and as wc differ in toto from our Abolition friends on the ques tion of abolishing slavery by physi al furcc, it i.s the bounded duty all real Democrats to subscribe liberally, and to tho widest possible extent, for their own paper. Serious times have overtaken and a great political battle has ho fought between the Abolitionists and Democrats of the North. there arc Union men and Secession ists opposed to each other in South, even so, wo shall now .that there will henceforth be 01 contending parties in the North, including tho whole of the Demo cratic party, and a large number of sound and constitutional Repub licans, who are honestly and ear nestly opposed to any and every attempt that might bo mado to divert the war from its original purpose and channel, and thus make it a war of slave emancipa tion by force of arms, and the party usually called Abolitionists, who have taken their aim, and arc resolved, at all hazards, to fico the slaves by violent means. The Democrats who will not support their own principles and paper in Old Preble, at such a time as this, arc unworthy of the "Stars and Stripes," and not to be trusted. As we have resolved to introduce some very interesting and import ant improvements in our paper, including European news and marr kets, at tho beginning of'the'year 1862, now is the time to subscribe, and thus extend our circulation. We shall have something to say on Christmas Day, and, therefore, wc advise all who wish to receive something to please them on that memorable day, to subscribe to the Treas at once. It is a great privilege to tho in habitants of Preble county, to have their own county papers to read. Preble is large and wealthy enough to support two papers: and, as the two parties are influential and car nest politicians, it is to their own advantage to sustain the county journals. Let our printing-offices in Eaton be visited, and our Demo cratic and Republican friends amj neighbors will see tl'.'c tho con ductors of uiy.7 spoors, nnj their printer work more like slaves inan tree men. l riutcrs never loaf; and, whether the proprietors receive their money or not, the ink and paper manufacturers, and the printers, must have their money tegularly. Friends readers sub scribers think on theso things. liemcmbcr them do. Many per sons get their newspapers from other counties, and some even from other States, while papers conduct cd with equal tact, talent, and skill, are published weekly in their own county, to support which they never spend a cent in twelve mouths. We write this to thoir shame. There arc two classes politicians in Preble. Let each prove that they arc sincere and love their principles, by giving free, generous, and manly support to their county papers. We are glad to report an increase of sub scribers, and of paid subscriptions within tho last few days. Wo re port theso facts to the honor our Democratic readers. For the Democratic Press. be are Mr. Editou,! wish to say few words througli the medium your paper, in reply to the answer of the Committee of the Camdeu Presbyterian church, touching my Protest against the action of that church, recently published in your paper. In their answer, the com mitteo do not pretend to show their authority for calling the meet ing referred to, for tho very good reason that the Constitution of Church docs not bear them out. and iu of our of us, to As the find two In tho prcamhlc of their published proceedings of the 23fh of October last, they said that I, as the repre sentative of the Camden church. the Synod, voted agiinst the Spring Resolutions, and that they were with the Synod, and not with me. Then followed their Resolutions, in one of which they said that out spoken loyalty was the bounden duty of every Christian citizen and in their answer to my Protest they say that my loyalty was out-spoken in the Synod. Claiming, as they do', that I was tho repre sentative of the church in Synod, their whole proceedings show that they at least made attempt to make out a case against me of misrepresentation ; but it an "historical fact" that my loyalty and fidelity to the church was spoken whcif I voted against paper referred to. The Constitution of tho church being tho measure of my authority, it follows what is set forth in my Protest true, and their answer falls to ground. The attempt to dispose of a part of my paper by a assertion, without proof, is in taste, us also the allusion to my tending and supervising their meet ing. " Facts are stubborn things, and no amount of sophistry can cover up the fact that tho intention was to condemn my vote. Were it not that there wero two sets of officers, the first getting up the preamble and resolutions, and the second preparing the answer, some icrsons might be disposed to say that tho two papers had but one author. I have no desire to pursue this matter farther with tho Cam den brethren, believing, that had it not been for intermeddlers in the affairs of others, this (to mo un pleasant affair) would not have been agitated in tho churches. I appear now beforo tho public pure ly iu self-defence.

Yet, when the noble Fremont made small advance towards this glori ous work, you went and took coun sel of "the inflated pimps" of your Cabinet, and displaced him.

EPITOME OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. A disloyal portion of the Amer ican people have, during the whole year, been engaged iu an attempt to uiviuo and destroy the union. A nation which endures factious and domestic institutions is ex posed to disrespect abroad, and one nartv. or both, is sure, sooner or later, to invoke forelgu interven tion. Nations thus tempted to inter fere aro not always able to resist tho counsels of seeming inexpedi ency and ungenerous ambition, al though measures adopted under such influences seldom fail to bo unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. lask the attention of Congress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots pf armsnd munitions, with harbott and navigation im provements, at well selected points upon these, would be of great im portance to- the national ueieuso and preservation. I ask attention to thotie4fl' tf the Secretary of War, expressed in his report upon the same general subject. If any good reason exists why we should persevere longer in with holding our recognition of the in denendenco and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit tor your con sideration the expediency of'an ap propriation fer maintain,, a Charge d' Affairs near eiCn 0f those States.

The recommendation by the Secretary for an organization of the militia upon a uniform basis is an object of vital Importance to the future safety ot the country, and is commended to the serious attention of Congress. A largo addition to tho regular army, in connection with the defection that has so con siderably diminished its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation tor increasing the corps of cadefs to the greatest ca pacity ot tho military academy. Wo have obtained a footing at each of the. isolated points on the Southern coast, of Ilatteras, Port Royal, lyheo Island, near Savan nah, and amp Island, and wo like wiso have some general accounts of popular movements in behalf the Union in North Carolina Tennessee.

Ho said this war had been inaugurated tor tne slave, and he was in favor of closing through the slave.

Bowring on the War. by and shall all in of fering in terminable The following extract from letter written by the Democratic Dr. Bowring, of Hong Kong noto riety, will servo to show that Radicalism of Europe is more sick of American Abolition and its horrible war.
