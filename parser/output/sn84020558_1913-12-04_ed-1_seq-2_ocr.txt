Thirty-four to two dozen was the scon, with the Tem pe high getting the long end of a hard fight. The Phoenicians showed astonishing improvements of play. They guarded with the best in the state, and tlieir only weakness a fatal one as vet was in basket shooting. Play was closer in this contest than in any the Coyotitos have lost yet. "Lost" is "coincident with "play ed" so far this season, but the way the young wolves are coming up, they will begin to win with regularity before long, n'ebb as forwards, Ladd in center and Pinney, Banks and Matthews as guards. Matthews supplanted Pinney in the last half. Tempo high lined up with Finch and- O. Brooks forwards. Kelly Moeiir cen ter and K. Brooks and Turner guards. Harris went in for Finch in the last part of the game. Mesa comes to Phoenix to play on the high school courts Saturday after noon. Phoenix goes to Clendale to try a fall with the husky young high school out there Tuesday after school. L C. Fitzgerald the universally pop ular r.-feree officiated by subpoena at last night's game.
