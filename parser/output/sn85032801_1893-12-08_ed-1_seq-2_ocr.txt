The following is the president's message: Message to the congress of the United States: The consty.utionnl duty which re quires the president from time to time to i ive to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall jud;e necessary and expedient is fittingly entered upon by com mending to the congress a cartful examination of the detailed statement? and well supported recommendations contained In the reports of the heads of departments who are chiefly charged with the executive work of the gov ernment In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with Its purpose, I shall supplement a brief reference to the contents of these departmental reports by the men tion of such o.ecutive busi ness and Incidents as are not mi ntioned therein and by such recommendations as appear to be at this p ar ticular time appropriate. While our foreign relations h id not at all times during the past year been entirely free from perplexity no embarrassing situation remains that will not yield to the spirit of fairness and love of jus tice which, joined with consistent firmness, characterize a truly American foreign policy. My predecessor having accepted the oitlee of arbitrator of the Ions standing missions boun dary disputes tendered by the president Df the Argentine Republic and Brazil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the special envoys commissioned iy those states to lay before me evidence and ar.uments in benalf of their re spective governmants. The outbreak of dem ocratic hostilities in the republio of Brazil found the United States steamships alert to watch the interests of our citizens In that country, with which we carry on an important commerce f-everal vessels of our new navy are now and for pome time have been stationed at Kio de Janeiro. The struggle being be tween the established government, which controls the machinery of administration, and wim which we maintain friendly rela tions, and certain officers of the navy emp.oy ing the vessels of their command In an attack upon the mtional capital and chi f seaport, and lacking, as it does the elements of di vided administration, I have failed to see that the insurgents' can reasonably claim recogni tion as beUi.erants Thus far the position of our government has been that of an attentive but an impartial observer of the unfortunate conflict. in passing our fixed policy of neu- trality in such a condition of affairs as now exist, 1 deem it ne.essary to disavow in a manner not to be misunderstood, the un authorized anion of our late naval commander In those waters in saluting the revolutionist Brazilian admiral, bein r indisposed to coun tenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanction to the local insurrectionists. The con vention between our government and Chill having for its object the settlement and ad justment of the demands of the two countries againsteach otherhas lieen mide effective bv the organization of the claims commission provided for. The two governments failing to agree upon a third member of the commisslou the good offices of the president of the Swiss Republic were invoked as provided in the treaty, ana tnc selection or the swi,s renresen tative in this country to complete the or ani- ration was grawying al ke to the United States and Chili and the vexatious questions of the so called legation asylum for offenders against the state and its laws was presented anew in Chill by the unauthorized action of tne lute united States minister in receiving lnt his official residence two persons who had just failed in an attempt at revosutlon and against wnom criminal charges were pending growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as applied to this case is not sanctioned by tne best precedents and when allowed tends to encourage sedition ana striie. unuoc no circumstances can the representatives or this government be per mitted unuer tue )'i denned action of extra territorial to interrupt the administration of criminal justice in the countries to wnich they re accreuuuu. a temperate demmd having, been m ule bv the Chilian government for the correction of this conduct in the instanm mpn. tioned the minister was Instructed no longer to harbor the offenders The legislation of last year known as the Geary law requiring the registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to residence In the United States and the deportation of all not complying with the provisions of the act within the time described, met with mi.ch opposition from Chinamen It this country. Acting upon the advice of emiuent counsel that the law was unconstitutional the great mass ot i.u'nese laborers pending judicial inquiry us to its validity, in pood faith de clined to apply for the certificates required by its provisions. A test case upon proceeding by habeas corpus was brou;lit before the supreme court, and on May l. 191, a decision was mane oy mat tribunal sustaining the law. It is lelieved that under the recent amend. Bent of the act extending the time for regis tration. the Chinese laborers thereto untitled who desire to reside in this country will now avail themselves of the renewed privilege thus afforded of establishing bv lawful Drocerlnm their right to remiin and thit thereby the m--siij oi en orcea asportation may be to a great de ree avoided Costa Kica his lately testified its frindli ness by surrendering to the United States in the absence of a convention of extradition but upon duly submitted evidence of criminality a noted fugitive from justice It is trusted that the negotiation of a treaty with that country to meet recurring cases df this kind will soon be accomplished In mv nnininn treaties for reciprocal extradition should be cwnciuueu witn ail mose countries with which the United States has not already conven tional arrangements of that i haracter. I havs deemed it fitting to express to the govern ments of Costa Rica and Colombia the kindly desire of the United States to see the pending boundary dispute finally closed by arbitration in coniormity with the spirit of the treaty concluded between them some years The questions affecting our relations with Great Britain have been treated in a spirit of friendliness Negotiations are in progress be- cvu iuo io governments with a view to such concurrent action as will make the award mi regulation a. reed upon by the Behrin? sea tribunal of arbitration practically effective and it Is not doubted that Great Britain will co-operate freely with this country for the ac complishment of that purpose The disputes growing out of the discrimination of tolls impcsed in the Wellaiid canal upon cargoes of cereals bound to and from the lake ports of the United States, was aijusted by the substitution of a more equitable sched ule of charges and my predecessor thereupon suspended his proclamation imposing discrim inating tolls upon British transit through our canals A request for additions to the list of extraditable offenses covered by the existing treaty between the two countries is under consideration Durin tte past year an American citizen employed in a subordinate commer cial position in Havti. after suffer tag a protracted imprisonment on an unfounded charge of smng-ling was finally liberated on judicial exam nation! Upon urgent representation to the Haytian government, a suitable indemnity was paid ta the sufferer Upon receiving authentic information of the firing upon an American m lil steamer touch ing at the port of Amapalsa, because her captain refused to deliver up a passenger from Nicaragua to Guatemala, upon demand of the military aut onties of Honduras our minister to that country under instructions, protested ftgaint the wanton act and demanded satis faction. The government of Honduras, actu ated by a sen-e of justice, and in a spirit of the utmost friendship, promptly disavowed the ill conduct of its officers and expressed sincere regret for the occurrence It is confidently anticipated that a satisfac tory adjustment will soon be reached of the question arising out of the seizure and use of American vessels by insurgents in Honduras, nd the subsequent denial by the successful government of commercial priTile es to those vessels on that account. Mcra;ca has recently passed 'through two revi lut ons, the pnrtv at first successful htv ing in tern been displaced by another Our newly appointed minister by his timely good otrces aided in a peaceful adjustment o; the controversy Involved in the Hrst conflict The Ian. e American interests established in that country in connection with the Nicaragua canal were not molested 'lhe Cuna1 company has unfortunately be come financially seriously embarrissed. but a generous treatment has been extended to it bv the government of Nicaragua The Uuited States are especially interested in thesuccess- ful achievement of the vast undertakinr this company has in charge. That it s jould be ac complished under distinctively American auspices and its enjoyment not only assured to the vessels of this country as a channel of communication bctweea our Atlintie and Pa cific se sboards but to the ships of tfcerorld in the interests of civilization is a propose ion which in my judgment does not adnit of quest on 

RELATION WITH hLRKKY. Important Mutters Demand Attention With the Ottoman Empire. Important matters have demanded attention In our relations with the Ottoman porte. The flrin. and partial destruction by an unre strained mob of one of the sctocl buildings of Anatolia college, established by citizens of the United States at Marsovan and the apparent indifference of the Turkish government to the outrage, notwitustandin ; the complicity of some of the officials, called for earnest remon strance, which was followed by promises of reparation and punishment of the offenders. Indemnity for the injury to the buildings has already been paid, permission to rebuild given, registration of the school property in the name of the American owners secured and efficient protection vuiirantecd Information received of maltreatments suf fered by an inoffensive American worn in en ga -ed ia missionary work in Turkish Koor distan was followed by such representations to tne porte as resulted in the issuance of orders for the punishment of her assail ants, the removal of a delinquent official and tne adoption or measures for the protection of our citizens en.'a.ed in mission and other law ful work in th it quarter. Turkey complains that her Armenian subject- obtain citizenship in this country not to identify themselves in good faith with our people, but with the intention of returning to the land of their birth ant thre en aing ia sedition This complaint is not whollv without foundation. A journal published In this country in the Armenian homage openly counsels its readers to arm.organize and participate in movements for the subver sion of Turkish authority in tha Asiatic prov inces. Tne Ottoman "government has an nounced its intention to repel from its domin ion Armeni ins who have obtained naturaliza tion in the United States since IMW The right to exclude any or all classes of aliens is an attribute of sovereignity. It is a right as serted and to a limited extent enforced by the United States with the sanction of our highest courts. There being no naturalization treaty between the United States and Turkey, our minister at Constantinople has been instructed that while recognizing the right of that govern ment to enforce its declared policy against ntituralizi d Americans, he is exacted to pro test trom unnecessary nar-nnessof treatment HAWAIIAN 1-OHCV.

It is hardly necessary for me to state that the questions arisiug from oar relations with Hawaii have caused serious embarrassment Just prior to the installation of the present administration the existing government ol Hawaii had been suddenly overthrown, and a treaty of annexation had been negotiated be tween the provisional government of the Islands and the United States and submitted to the sennit, fnr rtLtinVutinn Thic in, .i. r withdrew for examination and dispatched. .lames a. mount oi ueor:ia to Honolulu as a special commissioner to make an impartial in vestigation of the circumstances attending the l-han ft in rm'crnm.mt nnrt nf .,11 thu ..nr..

WAR 

DEPARTMENT. Uncle Sam'i Army Number 23,778 En listed Men and 2,144 Officers. The secretary of war reports that the strength of the army on the 30th day of Sep tember last was 25.778 enlisted men and 2. 144 officers. The total expenditures of the de partment for the year ending June 30, Ifc91 amounted to tol,966,074 89, of this sum U.9J2,- m 95 was for salaries and contingent expenses, ta.o77.8-g)S 3i f r the support of the militarv establishments, M.U77,o:ui8 for miscellaineous objects and (gu.altLvil.4l for public work. This latter sum includes $15,296,876. 18 for river and harbor improvements and $.t.2yS).l4l 20 for for tifications and other works of defense The total enrollment of the militia of the several states was, on the iilst of October of the current year. lli.W officers and enlisted men The officers of the army detailed for the inspection and instruction of this reserve of our military force report that increased inter est and marked progress are apparent in the discipline and efficiency of tbe or.'anizationa Neither Indian outbreaks nor domotic vio lence have called the army Into service durin? the year and the only active military duty re quired of it has been In the department of Texas, where violation of the neutrality laws of the United States and Mexico were prompt ly and efflViently dealt with by tho troops, eliciting the warm approval of the civil and military authorities of both countries The question of wise laws and the influences of civilization constantly temling to relieve the country from the dan:ers of Indian hostil ities to ;ethcr with the increasing ability of the states, throu.h the efficiency of the na tional guard organizations to protect their cit izens from domestic violence, lead to the sug gestion that the time is fast approachln ; when there should be a reorganization of our army on the lines of the present necessities of the country This change contemplates neither increase In number nor added expen-e, but a redistribution of the force and an encourage ment of measures tending to greater efficiency amont; the men and Im; rovement of the ser vice. After much preliminary works and examina tion in accordance with the requirements of tbe law the board appointed to select a maga zine rifie of modern type with orders to replace the obsolete Springfield rifle ot the Infantry service, completed its labors during the last year and the work of manufacturin ; is now in progress at the national armory at Springfield It is confidently expected that by the end of the current year our infantry will be supplied wifh a weapon equal to that of the most pro gressive armies of the world. The work of the pro ected Chlckamauga and Chattanoo a nathnal. military park has been prosecuted with zeal and jud ment and ita opening will be celebrated d:rlng tne coming year. Over nine square miles of the Chickamauga battle field have been acquired, twenty mires of roadway have been con structed and permanent tablets have been placed at many historical points, while the invitation to the states to mark the position of their troops participating in the battle has been very generally accepted. Tne work of locating and preserving the lines of battle at the Gettysburg battle field is making satis factory progress on the plans directed by the last congress. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The Abolition of the Fee System in I'm ted State Courts Recommended. The report of the attorney ge serai contains the usual summary of the affairs and proceed ings of the department of justice for the past year, together with certain recommendations as to needed legislation on various subjects I cannot too heartily indorse the proposition that tne fee system as applicable to the com pensation of United States aitorneys, mar shels. clerks of federal courts and United States commissioners should be abolished with as little delay ns possible. It Is clearly in the interest of the community that the business of tae courts, both civil and criminal, shall be as so ill and as inexpensively con ducted as the ends of justice will allow. In my first me-sage to con.ressdited De cember 8, 1$5, Istron:ly reoommended these changes and referred somewhat at length to the ev'ls of the present system. Since that time the criminal business of the federal court and the expense attending It, have enormously increased The number of crimi nal prosecutions pending In the circuit and district courts of the United states on the first day of July. 18j5, was 3,808, of which 1,84 were for violations of the internal revenue laws, w hile the number of such prosecutions pendlnr on the first da? ofuly, 1993, was 9.V0. in which 4JU0 were for violations of the Internal revenue laws. The expenne of tho United States eoum. eielnsive of jndgos" falane tor t 'e year ending July 1. 15. was ti.874,mil and tor the year ending July. 1S9I, M.M876 87. It is therefore apparent that the reasons given In W5 for a change in the manner of enforcing the fedenJ criminal law have gained cogency and siren. th by lapse of time. rOSTOFFKE 

DEPARTMENT. Tbe Discrepancy Between Receipts and Expenditures Much Commented Tpoo. The report of the postmaster-general con tains a detailed statement of the operations of the poatofflce department during the last fis cal year, and much interesting information touching this Important branch of- the public service. The business of the mails Indicate with absolute certainty the condition of the business of the country, and depression in financial affairs inevitably and quicitly reduces the postal revenues Therefore a larger dis crepancy than usual between the postoffice re ceipt and expenditures is the expected and nnavtidable result of the distressing string ency which has prevailed throughout tne country during much of the t'me covered by the postmaster general s report At a date wuen better times were antici pate it was estimated by his predecessor that the deficiency on the 30th day of June 1893 would be but little over tl.500.w0. It amounted, however, to more than $ OJ0.U0J. At the same time and under tbe influence of like anticipa tion estimates were made for the current us cal year ending June 3d, ISJt. which exibited a surplus ot revenue over expenditures of Is 72, 215 71 but now in view of the actnal receipts and expenditures durm' that part of the cur rent fiscal year already expired the present post master teneral estimates that at its close instead of a surplus there will be a deficiency oi nearly ss.ooj.uoi The postoffl.e receipts for the last fiscal year amounted to i75,M.9.i3 16 and its expend itures to 

SMI.UT4.1J4 W This postofflco de ficiency would disappear or be immensely de creased if less matter was carried free through the mills, an item of which is upward of 3ui tons of seeds and grain from the agricultural departments. The total number of post .fflces in the United Slates on the 3uth day of June 1-1)1 was 68.401, an increase of 1.2M over the preceding year Of these 3.360 were presiden tial, an increase in that class of 20t over the prect ding year The railway mall service not only adds to the promptness of mail delivery at all offices, but it Is the especial instrumentality which puts the smaller aud way p aces in the service on an equality in that regard with the larger and terminal office This branch of the postal service has there fore received much attention from tho post master teneral and though it is gratifying to know that it is in condition of high efficiency and great usefulness, I am led to a. ree with the I'ostmaster general that there is room for its furtaer improvement There are now con nected with the post, fflce establishment 28, t'4 employes who are In the classiiiel service. Tho head of this great department gives con clusive evidence of the value of civil service reform, when after an experience that renders his judgment on the subject absolutely relia ble, he expresses the opinion that without the benefit of thts system It would be impossible to conduct the vast business Intrusted to him I desire to commend as especially worthy of prompt attention the suggestions of the post master eneral relatin tQ a more sensible and business-like organization and a better dis tribution of responsibility in his department 

NAVY DEPARTMENT. Facts aud Figures Regarding the Naval Strength of the Country. The report of the secretary of the navy con tains a history of the operations of his de partment during the past year and exhibits u most gratifying condition of the personnel of our navy. Ho presents a satisfactory account of pro ress wnich has been made in the con struction of vessels and makes a number of recommendations which Is especially invited During the past six months the demands for cruising vessels have been many and urgent There have been revolutions calling for ves sels to protect American interests in Nicara gua, Guatemala, Costa KUa, Honduras, Argen tine and Brazil, while the condition of affairs tn Honolulu has required the constant pres ence ot one or more Biiips with all these calls upon our navy it became necessary in or der to m.ike up a sufficient fleet, to patrol the oennng sci under l.ie modus Vivendi a:reed upon with Great Britain to detail to that ser vice one vessel from the fish commiss on and three from the revenue marine Progress in the constr iction of new vesseis has not been as rapid as was anticipated. Ttiere have been delays in the comp.etion of unarmed vessels, but for tho most part they have been such as was constantly occurring in countries having the lar .est experience In naval ship budding. The most serious delays, however, have been In the work upon armored ships. The trouble has been the failure of contractors to deliver armor as agreed The difficultins seem no. however to nave been all overcome and armor is being delivered with satisfactory promptness. The follow In ; vessels of the now navy have been completed and are now ready for service: The double turreted coast defense monitor Miantonomah. the double turreted coast de fone monitor Monterey, the armed cruiser New York, the protected cruisers Baltimore, Chicago. Ph ladelphla. Newark, San Fran cisco, Charleston. Atlanta and Boston, the cruiser Detroit, the gun boats Yorktown, Con cord Bennington, Machias. Castlce and l"ctrel. the dispatch vessel Dolphin, the prac tice ve sel Bimroft and the dynamite gun boat Vesuvius. Of these the Bancroft Machias Detroit and Castine have been placed in com mission during the current year.

INTERIOR DKPAltTMENT. Pension Frauds Vigorously Denounced and the Admin it ration' Poltry Upheld The secretary of the Interior hi the super vision of so many Important subjects that his report is of special vilue and interest On the thirtieth day of June, 1891, there were on the pension rolls 963,012 names, an increaso ot 69,9U over the number on tbe rolls June 30, Iwi Ot these there were seventeen widows and daughters of revolutionary soldiers, thirty surrivers of the warof 181J. ASJ. widows of soldiers of that war. 21.518 survivors and widows of tbe Mexican war, 3 8s 2 survivors and widows of Indian wars, last army nurses and 47i,M5 sur vivors and widows and children of deceased soldiers and sai ors of the war of the rebellion. The latter number represents those pensioned on account of disabilities or death resulting from army or navy scrvic; The number of persons remaiuinr on the rolls June 30, 18JX who were pensioned un ler the act of June 27. ls). which allows pensions on account of aoata ana disability not chargeable to army serv ce, was 1..9.155 The number Bdded to the rolls durin; the year was lili.SU and the number dropped was 3.1.69J The first payments on pensions al lowed durin' the year amounted to (3.1.75(1. &US. This includes arrears or tho accum u ation between the tim? from which the allowance of pension dates and the time of actually granting the certificates alihou.-h the law of l90 permits pensions for disability not J related to military service yet as a requisite to its ururui a uasauiuiy must exist incapaci tating applicants 'irom the performance of manual labor to such a degree as to reader them unable to earn a support" Execution of this law In its early stages does not seem to have been in accord with its true Intention but toward the close of the last ad ministration an authoritative construction was given to the statute and since that time this construction has been followed This had the effect of limiting the operation of the law to its intended purposes. Tha discovery having been made that many names had been put upon the pension roil by meats of wholesale and tlgantio frauds, the commissioner suspended payments upon a num ber ot pensions which seemed to be fraudulent or unauthorized pending' a complete examina tion giving notice to the pensioners in ord-r that they might have an opportunity to establish, if possible, the justice of their claims notwithstanding apourcnt invalidity This, I understand, is the pnetice which his for a long time prevailed in tho pension bureau, but after entering upon these recent investigations the commiss oner modified this rule so as not to allow until after a complete examination interference with the payment of a pension apparently not altogether void but which merely had been fixed at a rite higher than that authorized by law. I am unabh to understand why frauds in the pension rolls should not be exposed and corrected with thoroughness and vi.-or Every n tme fraudu lently put upon these rolls is a wicked Im position upon tae kindly seutiment in which pensions have their origin. Every fraudulent pensioner has become a bad citizen very false with support of a pension has been perjuy more common ana false and unit-serving pensioners roo the people not only of their money, but of the patriotic sentiment hich the survivers of a war fought for the preserv ation of the union ought to Inspire Thous ands of nei hborhooJs have their well known fraudulent pensioners and recent develop ments by the bureau establish appallin ' con spircies to establish pension fraud. By no means the least wrong done Is to brave and deserving pensioners, who surely on ht not to be condemned to such associations.

Secretary Rank's Economic Idea strong- ly Commended. The report of the secretary of agriculture will bi found exceedingly Interes' ng. espe cially to that large part of our citizens nil tnatcly concerned In agricultural occupations. On the ninth day of March. Wi, there were upon it-, pay rolls 2.131 employes This n!i ber tas been reduced to 1,850 persons. In view of a depleted public treasury and the itnperitive demand of the peo pie for economy in tue administration of their government the M-cretary has entered upoa the task of ration illy reducing expendi tures bv t ie elimin iting from the oay rolls of all liert ons not needed for un emeu nt conduct of tne affairs of the department During the first quarter of the present year the expenses of the department aggregated f 145,876.76 as against duv'U 4: for thi corresponds : per iod or tnc ncai vear ending June so.ih.m.

This suggests that the fallin; off may hive been largely due to an increase in the price of American export came Dunn t tue year end ing June 30, l-y;, exports of inspected pork aggregated 2o.677.tl0 pounds as against 1-8.152.-874 pounds for the precedin year Tne falling off in this export was not confin d however to tnspec ed porlc. the total quantity exported ror I8C2 being os siu.oio pounds, while in 1891 it was only ; 27..u.i9.i pounds.

During the last fiscal year tbe cost ot seeds purchased was M.54S.61 the remainder ot an appropriation of OXt.OJO was expended in pnttin; them up and distributing them It surely never could have entered the mindset those who first sanctioned appropri ations of public money for tbe purchase of new and imoroved varieties of seeds for distribution that from this would gr iw large appropriations for the purchase and dstribution by memiers of rongr ss ot ord n -.ry seeds, bulbs, cuttings which are com mon in all the st ites and territories and every where easily obtainable at low prices. In each state and territory an agricultural experi ment station has been established. These sta tions by th: Ir very character and name are the proper agencies to experiment with and tst new varieties of seeds and yet this indiscrim inate and wasteful distribution by legislation and legislators continues, answering no pur pose unless It be to remind constituents that their representatives are willint to remember them with uratutles at public cost Under the sanction ot existing legislation there was sent out from tbe agricultural de partment during the last fiscal year enough ot cabb e seed to plant 19.200 acres of land, a sufficient quantity of beans to plant 4.000 acres, beet seed enough to plant 2.5U0 acres, sweet corn enough to plant T.8J0 acres, suffi cient cucumber seed to cover t,o2 acres with Tines and enough muskmelon and watermelon seeds to plant 5 075 acres The total quantity of floern t ve i-t Mt! eeds thus distributed was ronl lined tn more thin 8.l.ii pucka.-es and they were Mirtkienl if planted ti cover iuM acres of land In view of these facts this enormous expen diture ulhoul n.iiimaie returns of benefit ouk'ht to be abolished ( 1VIL K l ffJjKKKOKM. trnn; (rouii.U iu n fnr Iu I mil I nned I irnitiou.

TARIFF REVISION. Discriminating Care Crgfd In Adjusting Duties In the New TarIT UllL Economy In public expenditure is a duty that cuinot Innocently be no.lectd by those enirusied with the control of money drawn fro-.ii the peop.e lor public uses. It must be confessed that our apparently endless re so.ir.es tbe faml larity of our people with Im mense a.'cu.uuoiilons of wealth, the rowing sentiment among them that the expenditure of public money should in snme manner be to their immediate and personal advantage, the Indirect and almost stealthy manner in which a lar.e part of our taxes are exacted and a de generated sense of official accountability have led to growing extravagance In governmental appropriations At thls'time when a depleted publ ic treasury confronts us, when many of our people are engaed In a hard siru;glo for the necessaries of life, and when forced economy is pros sing upon tht) great masses of our ceuctrymen, I desire to urge witn all the earnestness at my command that congressioa.il legislation be so Umit"d by strict economy as to exhibit an ap preciation of the conduct of the treasury and a sympathy with the s.raiteued circumstances of our feilow citizen. The duty of l ubtlo economy Is also of immense im;Hrtance In Us Intimate and necessary relation to the task now in hand of pr ividing revenue to meet i overnment exoenditure and yet reducing the peonies burden of federal taxation After a hard utruvgle tariff reform is direct ly bef ore us Nothing so important claims our attention and nothing so clearly presents Itself as both un opportunity and a duty an opportunity to deserve the gratitude of our fellow citizens and a duty imposed upon us by our ofrepcated professions and by the em phatic mandate of the people After full dis-cus-tiou our countrymen hive spoken In favor of this reform and they hive con tided the work of its accomplishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pu-d ed to It. If there is anything In the theory of representation in nubile places of the people and thel -de-ir '. if public officers are really servants of the ieopl, and if political promises aud professions oive any binding force our failure to give the relief so i ng awaited will be sheer recreancy. Nothing sh nilil interfere to distr u-t our attteution or disturb our effirt until this reform Is ae compiUhe i by wise and rueful legislation. While we should staunchly adhere to the principle thit o ily the nece-sliy of revenue justifies the imposition of tariff duties and Other federal tit.ition aud that ther should be limited by strict economy, we cannot close our eyes to tbe fact thit conditions have tirown up among us which in justice nnil lirm' ness call lor discriminating care in dstribu tion of such duties and taxation as the e mcr.-enclcs of our goveraru ;ni actuilly dem id. .i.in.iestly if we are fo aid the people direct ly through t rill r.-form oi- of its most obvious features should be a reduction In present tariff charges upon tiie tecessiries of life. The benefits of such a reductiou wou'd be palpable andsubnt ntially seen an I felt bv thousands who would be Ix-tter fed and betler clothed and better sheltered These cifts should be the willin; benefactions of a government whose hi hest function is the promotion of the welfare of tho people. Not Toss closely related to our peop e s prosperity and well being Is the removal of r functions upon tbe Importation of the r.i- materials necessary to our inauf ictures T .e world should lie open to our national Ingenuity aud enterprise This cannot be whilo federal legislation through the imposition of high tiriff forbids tc American mmufacturers as cheip materi als as those used ty their competitors. It is quite obvious that the enh 'inccm.'ml of the pr cc of our nrmr.f x tured products resulting from this poiii y not o ily tontines tbe market for tts products wittiout our on bodies to the direct d Kidvai.ta:e of our ;m idufacturcrs hot also increases taeir cost to our citizens 1 he Interests of 1 itor are certainly, though Indirectly involved In this feiture of our tariff system The sharp competi tion and active struggle among our mmufacturers to supply the limited demand for tteir goods soon till the narrow market to which they are coutined Then follows a sus pension o: work in mills and factories, a dis charge of i mploves and distress In the homes of our workin.'men. Even if the often dis proved assertion could be mule good that a lower rate of wages would result from free raw materials and low tariff duties, tbe Intelli gence of our workin men lewis them quickly to discover thit their stead employment per mitted by free raw materials is the Important factor In their relation to tariff legislation. A measure has been prep.ired by the an- firopriate congressional committee .'embody ng tariff reform on the lines herein su.gested, which will be promptly submitted for legis lative action. It Is the result of much patri otic and unselfish work and I believe it deals with its subject consistently and as thoroughly as existing conditions permit. I am satisfied that the rednced tariff duties proviJed for in tbe proposed legislation, added to existing Internal revenue t xalion will In the near future, though perhaps not immediately, pro duce sufficient revenue to meet the needs ot tbe government Tue committee after full consideration and to provide against a temporary dell lency which mav exist before the business of the country adjusts itself to tbe new tariff sched ule have wisely embraced In their plan a few additional internal revenue taxs. Including a small tax upon incomes derived from certain corporate Investments. These new assess ments are not only absolutely just and easily borne, but they hive the further merit of be ing such as can be remitted without unfavora ble business disturbances whenever the neces sity of their imposition no longer exists. In my great desire for the success of this meisure I cannot restrain the su.-gestira that its success can on. y be attain-d by me ins of unselfish counsel on the part of the friends of tariff reform and as a re-ult of t leir willingness to subordinate personal desires and ambit.ons to the general good The local inlere.-ts af fected by tbo proposed reform are so numer ous and so varied that If all are lnsl-ted upon tha legislation embodylnj the reform must In evitably fatL In conclusion my Intense feeling of respon sibility impels me to invoke for the manifold Interests ot a generous and confiding people the most scrupulous love and to pledge my willing support to every legislative effort for the advancement of the greatness and pros perity of our beloved country.
