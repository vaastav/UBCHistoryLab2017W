Mr. llryan complains that what the president says cm tho subject of gov ernment by Injunction will not be satisfactory to the laboring; men, or to those who respect the right of trial by Jury. The president's stand on child labor is commended, as Is also the position he takes on thn eight-hour day law and tlio right of the people to criticise a Judge. "Hi pays a deserved tribute to tha projr- rcB. of the Japanese nation," says Mr. llryan. "There will be general disappointment at the warlike tone of his message where he discusses the army and the navy. He speaks of the navy as the surest guarantor of poaco which this country possesses.
