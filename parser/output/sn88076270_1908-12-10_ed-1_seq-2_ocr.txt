MOST NEEDED LEGISLATION Control of Corporations, in the Opinion of President Roosevelt, Should Be Left to the National Government— Dissertation on the Status of the Wageworker—Action of Labor Lead ers Severely Criticised—Necessity for Respect of Law. "Washington, Dec. 8.—Themessage ot President Roosevelt was read in both houses of congress. It was as follows: To the Senate and House of Represen tatives: The financial standing of the nation at the present time is excellent, and the financial management of the na tion's Interests by the government dur ing the last seven years has shown the most satisfactory results. But our cur rency system is imperfect, and It is ear nestly to be hoped that the currency commission will be able to propose a thoroughly good system which will do away with the existing defects. During the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, .1908, there was an increase In the amount of money in circulation of 9902,991,399. The increase In the per capita during this period was $7.06. "Within this time there were several occasions when ft was necessary for the treasury de partment to come to the relief of the money market by purchases or redemp tions of United States bonds by increas ing deposits in national banks by stim ulating additional issues of national bank notes, and by facilitating importations from abroad of gold. Our imperfect cur rency system has made these proceedings necessary, and they were effective until the monetary disturbance in the fall of 3907 immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary methods of relief. By the mid dle of November the available working balance in the treasury had been reduced to approximately $5,000,000. Clearing house associations throughout the coun try had been obliged to resort to the expedient of issuing clearing house cer tificates, to be used as money. In this emergency it was determined to Invite subscriptions for $50,000,000 Panama canal bonds, and $100,000,000 three per cent, certificates of indebtedness authorized by the ac.t of June lSj. 1898. It was proposed ,rU": T. i:.tfin to redeposlt In the national banks the proceeds of these issues, and to permit their use as a basis for additional circu lating notes of national banks. The moral effect of this procedure was so great that it was necessary to issue only $24,631,980 of the Panama bonds and $15, 436,500 of the certificates of indebtedness. During: the period from July 1, 1901, to September 30, 1908, the balance between the net ordinary receipts and the net ordinary expenses, of the government showed a surplus In the four years 1902, 1M3, 1906, and 1907, and a deficit in the years 1904, 1905, 1908 and a fractional part of the fiscal year 1909. The net result was a surplus of 199,283,413.54. The finan cial operations of the government during this period, based upon these differences between receipts and expenditures, re sulted In a net reduction of the Interest bearing debt of the TJnlted States from 1987,141,040 to 1897,253,990, notwithstanding that there had been two sales of Panama canal bonds amounting In the aggregate to 154,631,980, and an issue of three per cent, certificates of indebtedness under the act of June 13, 1898, amounting to 115,436,500. Refunding operations of the treasury department under the act of March 14, 1900, resulted in the conver sion into two per cent, consols of 1930 of $200,309,400 bonds bearing higher rates of Interest. A decrease of $8,687,956- in the annual interest charge resulted from these operations. In short, during the seven years and three months there has been a net sur plus of nearly one hundred millions, of receipts over expenditures, a reduction of the Interest-bearing debt by ninety millions, in spite of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal, and a saving of nearly nine millions on the annual interest charge. This is an exceedingly satisfactory showing, especially in view of the fact that during this period the nation has never hesitated to undertake any expenditure that It regarded as nec essary. There have been no new taxes and no increase of taxes on the con trary some taxes have been taken off there has been a reduction of taxation. 

CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS. National Government the Proper Agent for the Work. As regards the great corporations en gaged in interstate business, and espe clally the railroads, I can only repeat what I have already again and again said I in my messages to the congress. I be- All the late shades and shapes in Ties, ranging from Silk and Lisle Suspenders, ranging from Silk Mufflers, ranging from Initial Silk Handkerchiefs, ranging from Dress Shirts, ranging from 1 Ueve that under the interstate clause of the constitution the United States has complete and paramount rght to con trol all agencies of interstata commerce, I and I believe that the national govern ment alone can cxercise thin right with wisdom and effectiveness so as both to secure Justice from, and to do justice to, the great corporations which are the most important factors in modern bual ness. I believe that It is worse than folly to attempt to prohibit all com binations as Is done by the Sherman antl-trust law, because such a law can be enforced only Imperfectly and un equally, and its enforcement works al most as much hardship as good. I strongly advocate that instead of an un wise effort to prohibit all combinations, there shall be substituted a law which shall expressly permit combinations which are in the Interest of the public, but shall at the same time give to some agency in the national government full power of control and supervision over thom One of the chief features of this control should be securing entire pun licity in all matters which the jftiblic has a right to know, and furthermore, the power, not by judicial but by. execu tive action, to prevent or put a stop to •very form of improper favoritism or other wrongdoing. The railways of the country should be put completely under the interstate com merce commission and removed from the domain of the anti-trust law. The power of the commission should be made thoroughgoing, so that it could exercise complete supervision and control over the issue of securities as well as over the raising and lowering of rates. As regards rates, at least, this power should be summary. The power to investigate the financial operations and accounts of the railways lias been one of the most valuable features In recent legislation.

Power to make combinations anfl traffic agreements should be explicitly conferred upon the railroads, the permission ot the commission being first gained and the combination or agreement beUig pub lished in all Its details. In the interest of the public the representatives of the public should have complete power to see that the railroads do their /duty by the public, and as a matter of course this power should also be exercised so as to see that no injustice is done to the railroads. The shareholders, the em ployes and the shipped all have interests that must be guarded. It is to the In terest of all of them that no swindling stock speculation should be allowed, ffiu that there should be no improper Issu ance of securities. The guiding intelli gences necessary for the successful build ing and successful 'management of rail roads should receive ample remunera tion but no man should be allowed to make money in connection with railroads out of fraudulent over-capitalization and kindred stock-gambling performances there must be no defrauding of invest ors, oppression of the farmers and busi ness men who ship freight, or callous diregard of the rights and needs of the employes. In addition to this the Inter ests of the shareholders, of the employes and of the shippers should all be guarded as against one another. To give any one of them undue and im proper consideration is to do injustice to the others. Rates must be made as lew as is compatible with giving proper re turns to all the employes of the rail road, from the highest to the lowest, and proper returns to the shareholders, but they must not, for instance, be re duced in such fashion as to necessitate a cut in the wages of the employes or the abolition of the proper and legitimate profits of honest shareholders. Telegraph and telephone companies en gaged in interstate business should be put under the jurisdiction of the Inter state commerce commission. People Urged to Act. It is very earnestly to be wished that our people, through their representatives, should act In this matter. It is hard to say whether most damage to the coun try at large would come from entire failure on the part of the public to su pervise and control the actions of the great corporations, or from the exercise of the necessary governmental power in a way which would do injustice and wrong to the corporations. Both the preachers of unrestricted individualism and the preachers of an oppression which would deny to able men of busi ness the just reward of their initiative and business sagacity, are advocating policies that would be fraught with the gravest harm to the whole country. To permit every lawless capitalist, every law-defying corporation, to take any ac tion, no matter how iniquitous, in the effort to secure an improper profit and to build up privilege, would be ruinous to the republic and would mark the aban donment of the effort to-secure in the in dustrial world the spirit of democratic fair-dealing. On the other hand, to at tack these wrongs in that spirit of dem agogy which can see wrong only when committed by the man of wealth, and is dumb and blind in the presence of wrong committed against men of property or by men of no property, is exactly as evil as corruptly to defend the wrongdoing of men of wealth. The war we wage must be waged against misconduct, against wrongdoing wherever it is found: and we must stand heartily for the rights of every decent man, whether he be a man of great wealth or a man who earns his livelihood as a wageworker or a tiller of the soli. It is to the interest of all of us that there should be a premium put upon In dividual initiative and individual ca pacity, and an ample reward for the great directing intelligences alone com petent to manage the great business op erations of to-day. It is well to keep in mind that exactly as the anarchist is the worst enemy of liberty and the reaction ary the worst enemy of order, so the men who defend the rights of property have most to fear from the wrongdoers of great wealth, and the men who are championing popular rights have most to fear from the demagogues who in the name of popular rights would do wrong to and oppress 'hcine^t business raen^ .s ..

Bros. honest med of wealth for the success of either type of wrongdoer necessarily in vites a violent reaction against the cause the wrongdoer nominally upholds. In point of danger to the nation there Is nothing to choose between on the one hand the corruptlonist, the bribe-giver, the bribe-taker, the man who employs his great talent to swindle his fellow citizens on a large scale, and, on the other hand, the preacher of class hatred, the man who, whether from Ignorance or from willingness to sacrifice his coun try to. his ambition, persuades well meaning but wrong-headed men to try to destroy the Instruments upon which our prosperity mainly rests. Let each group of men beware of and guard against the shortcomings to which that group is itself most liable. Too often we see the business community in a spirit of unhealthy class consciousness deplore the effort to hold to account under the law the wealthy men who in their man agement of great corporations, whether railroads, street railways, or other in dustrial enterprises, have behaved In a way that revolts the conscience of the plain, decent people. Such an attitude cannot be condemned too severely, for men of property should recognize that they jeopardize the rights of property when they fail heartily to Join In the ef fort to do away with the abuses of wealth. On the other hand, those who advocate proper control on behalf of the public, through the state, of these great corporations, and of the wealth engaged- on a giant scale In business op erations, must ever keep in mind that unless they dp scrupulous justice to the corporation, unless they permit ample profit, and cordially encourage capable men of business so long as they act with honesty, they are striking at the root of our national well-being for In the long run, under the mere pressure of material distress, the people as a whole would probably go back to the reign of an unrestricted individualism rather than submit to a control by the state so drastic and so foolish, conceived in a spirit of such unreasonable and narrow hostility to wealth, as to pre vent business operations from being profitable, and therefore to bring ruin upon the entire business community, and ultimately upon the entire body of citi zens. ,, Interstate Commerce Problem. The opposition to government control of these great corporations makes its most effective effort in the shape of an appeal to tl?e old doctrine of states' rights. Of course there are many sincere men who now believe in unrestricted in dividualism in business, just as there were formerly many sincere men who believed in slavery—that is, In the un restricted right of an Individual to own another individual. These men do not by themselves have great weight, how ever. The effective fight against ade quate government control and supervi sion of individual, and especially of cor porate, wealth engaged in interstate business is chiefly done under cover and especially under cover of an appeal to states' rights. It is not at all infre quent to read In the same speech a de nunciation of predatory wealth fostered by special privilege and defiant of both the public welfare and law of the land, and a denunciation of centralization in the central government of the power to deal with this centralized and organized wealth. Of course the policy set forth In such twin denunciations amounts to absolutely nothing, for the first half is nullified by the second half. The chief reason, among the many sound and com pelling reasons, that led to the formation of the national government, was the ab solute need that the union, and not the several states, should deal with inter state and foreign commerce and the power to deal with interstate commerce was granted absolutely and plenarily to the central government and was exer cised completely as regards the only in struments of interstate commerce known in those days—the waterways, the high roads, as well as the partnerships of in dividuals who' then conducted all of what business there was. Interstate commerce is now chiefly conducted by railroads and the great corporation has supplanted the mass of small partnerships or Indi viduals. The proposal to make the na tional government supreme over, and therefore to. give it complete control over, 50c to $1.00 50s to 2.50 75c to 2.50 35eto .75 $1.00 to 2.50 knocked the railroads an8 other Instruments "of Interstate commerce is merely a propos al to carry out to the letter one of the prime purposes, If not the prime purpose, for whieh the constitution was founded. It does not represent centralisation. It represent* merely the acknowledgment of the patent fact that centralisation has already come in business. If this irre sponsible outside business power Is to be controlled in the interest of the general public it can only be controlled In one way by giving adequate power of con trol to the one sovereignty capable of ex ercising such pdwer—the national govern ment. Forty or fifty separate govern ments cannot exercise that power over corporations doing busliiesa in most all of them first, because they absolutely lack the authority to deal with inter state business in any form and second, because of the inevitable conflict of au thority sure to arise in the effort to en force different kinds of state regulation, often Inconsistent with one another and sometimes oppressive in themselves* Such divided authority cannot regulate commerce with wisdom and effect. The central government is the only power which, without oppression, can never theless thoroughly and adequately con trol and supervise the large corporations. To abandon the effort for national con trol means to abandon the effort for all adequate control and yet to render likely continual bursts of action by state legis latures, which cannot achieve the pur pose sought for, but which can do a great deal of damage to the corporation without conferring any real benefit on the public. Corporations Learning Wisdom. I believe that the more farsighted cor porations are themselves coming to rec ognize the unwisdom of the violent hos tility they have displayed during the last few years to regulation and control by the national government of combinations engaged in interstate business. The truth is that we who believe In this movement of asserting and exercising a genuine control, in the public interest, over these great corporations have to contend against two sets of enemies, \yho, though nominally opposed to one another, are really allies in preventing a proper solution of the problem. There are, first, the big corporation men, and the extreme individualists among busi ness men, who genuinely believe in ut terly unregulated business—that Is, in the reign of plutocracy and, second, the men who, being blind to the econom ic movements of the day, believe in a movement of repression rather than of regulation of corporations, and who de nounce boSi the power of the railroads and the exercise of the federal power which alone can really control the rail roads. Those who believe in efficient na tional control, on the other hand, do not in the least object to combinations do not in the least object to concentration in business administration. On the con trary, they favor both, with the all-impor tant proviso that there shall be such pub licity about their workings, and such thoroughgoing control over them, as to insure their being in the Interest, and not against the interest, of the general public. We do not object to the concen tration of wealth and administration but we do believe in the distribution of the wealth in profits to the real owners, and in securing to the public the full benefit of the concentrated administration. We believe that with concentration in ad ministration there can come both the advantage of a larger owneshlp and of a more equitable distribution of profits, and at the same time a better service to the commonwealth. We believe that the administration should be for the benefit of the many and that greed and ras cality, practiced on a large scale, should be punished as relentlessly as if practiced on a small scale. We do not for a moment believe that the problem will be solved by any short and easy method. The solution will come only by pressing various concurrent remedies. Some of these remedies must lie outside the domain of all government. Some must lie outside the domain of the federal government. But there is leg islation which the federal government alone .can enact and which is absolutely vital in order to secure the attainment of our purpose. Many laws are needed. There should be regulation by the na tional government 2? the. great, interstate 12 Williston, N. D. corporations, Including a simple method of account keeping, publicity, supervision of the Issue of securities, abolition of rebates and of special privileges. There should be short-time franchises for all corporations engaged In public business Including the corporations which get power from water rights. There should be national as well as state guardianship of mines and forests. The labor legisla tion hereinafter referred to should ooa currently be enacted Into law. N For Centralized Power. To accomplish this, means a certain In crease In the use of—not the creation of —power, by the central government The power already exists It does not bare to be created the only question Is whether It shall be used or left Idle— and meanwhile the corporations over which the power ought to be exercised will not remain idle. Let those who ob Ject to this increase in the use of the only power available, the national pow er, be frank, and admit openly that they propose to abandon any effort to control the great business corporations and to exercise supervision over the accumula tion and distribution of wealth for such supervision and control can only come through this particular kind of increase of power. We no more believe In that empiricism which demands absolutely unrestrained Individualism than we do in that empiricism which clamors for a deadening socialism which would destroy all Individual initiative and would ruin the country with a completeness that not even an unrestrained individualism itself could achieve. The danger to American democracy lies not in the least in the concentration of administrative power in responsible and accountable hands. It lies in having the power insufficiently concentrated, so that no one can be held responsible to the people for its use. Concentrated power is palpable, visible, responsible, easily reached, quickly held to account. Power scattered through many administrators, many legislators, many men who work behind and through legislators and administrators, Is impal pable, is unseen, is irresponsible, cannot be reached, cannot be held to account. Democracy is In peril wherever the' ad ministration of political power Is scat tered among a variety of men who work in secret, whose very names are un known to the common people. It is not in peril from any nu.n who detfives au thority from the people, who exercises it in sight of the people, and who Is from time to time compelled to give an account of its exercise to the people. STATUS OF WAGEWORKER. Wise Action by States Needed to Sup plement That of Nation. There are many matters affecting labor and the status of the wageworker to which I should like to draw your atten tion, but an exhaustive discussion of the problem in all its aspects is not now nec essary. This administration is nearing its end and, moreover, under our form of government the solution of the prob lem depends upon the action of the states as much as upon the action of the nation. Nevertheless, there are certain considerations which I wish to set be fore you, because I hope that our people will more and more keep them in mind. A blind and ignorant resistance to every effort for the reform of abuses and for the readjustment of society to modern industrial conditions represents not true conservatism but an incitement to the wildest radicalism: for wise radical ism and wise conservatism go hand in hand, one bent on progress, the other bent on seeing that no change is made unless in the right direction. I believe in a steady effort, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say in steady efforts in many different directions, to bring about a condition of affairs under which the men who. work with hand or with brain, the laborers, the superintendents, the men who produce the market and the men who find a market for the articles produced, shall own a far greater share than at present of the wealth they pro duce, and be enabled to invest It in the tnols and Instruments by which all work is carried In. As far as. possible I hope to see a frank recognition of. the advan- Continued on Page Three
