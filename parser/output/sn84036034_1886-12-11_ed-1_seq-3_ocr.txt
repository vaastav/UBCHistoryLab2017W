There is not a journalist in the country who does not agree with Henry George say ing: "Among all the workers there are none who work harder than the working news paper man." The largest day's work ever done in the Pension Bureau was accomplished the 2d inst. Forty lady clerks were employed until midnight of that day in granting cer tificates, and were sent home in carriages, being too much exhausted to walk. The Republicans generally claim that by far the greatest part of the Labor party's vote will be drawn from the Democratic party. Such a claim is at least a confes sion that the Republicans regard the Dem ocratic party as at present much more of a workingman's party than the Republi can. Late telegrams from Mexico give a some what indefinite account of the capture of the man who swindled the people of the City of Mexico out of $30,000 by repre senting himself as the agent of Mr, Abbey of the Patti combination. It is thought a large portion, if not all the money, wil be recovered. In speaking of the President's message, the Helena Herald says: "The style is clear and unambitious. The views are gen erally sound and conservative. On the whole we find more to commend than to condemn." All of which is in striking con trast with some other Republican journals which can never see anything to commend that comes from Mr. Cleveland. At the solicitation of his many friends Capt. Shepherd will be a candidate for door-keeper of the lower House of the Legislative Assembly which will convene at Helena next month. The Captain is a veteran in the ranks of the Democratic party and he certainly deserves this slight recognition at the hands of his party for his life-long services within the ranks. The House will doubtless favorably consider the claims of the Captain, especially in view of the fact that Silver Bow County, the most populous county in the Terri tory, asks so little from that body. Mr, Bergh bas set an example of indiffer ence to lucre that astonishes all the people in the departments at Washington. It is found that the Government owes him $131 which he declines to draw because he can not remember that the Government owes it. This sum is not one that may be supposed to test to the utmost the passion of cupidity, but yet it is enough to point the moral that a man with a purpose is nota money-worshipper. But there is a precedent that we are afraid the course taken by Mr. Bergh is likely to establish. This is that to have forgotten a money ac count is equivalent to a settlement. A rule of this sort would completely ruin the mem ory of many debtors. The effort to organize the National Union Labor party through a convention to be held in Cincinnati on Washington's birth day seeks to combine with the Knights of Labor and trades unions the Greenback Granger, soldier, Anti-Monopoly and nearly all other industrial and minor po litical organizations in one grand political ollapodrida. If the union could be effect ively made it would certainly possess ele ments of great power. Whether the organ ization as such can embark in so obviously a political movement, and whether the ele ments are not too incoherent, are doubts that remain to be solved. In the division of the labor in preparing the President's message for publication in this office, that portion of it containing his remarks concerning silver coinage was placed in the hands of an assistant to edit, and upon his assurance that the question of silver was not referred to, it was over looked by the editor of this journal, and the article to which our eveniug contempo rary refers was written. When President Arthur made the same recommendations concerning the suspension of silver coinage which appears in Mr. Cleveland's message, the Inter Mountain heartily endorsed it and cried lustily against the "dishonest dollar," "the short-weight dollar" and the "fraudulent dollar" of 412% grains. The Miner made no such mistake. Its error was an unimportant one. That of the In ter Mountain consisted of a premeditated, cold-blooded attack upon the prime inter ests of Butte, for which there was no justi fication. _ of is is he do are all THE 

SIGNAL SERVICE. Gen. Hazen, chief signal officer, has learned something since he was first out in West ern Dakota and reported the country west of the Missouri river an arid desert unfit for the habitation of man. He now pro poses to reorganize the signal service in which it is provided that a more extensive system of the service shall cover the great Northwest. He has submitted to the Sec retary of War a plan in the shape of a care fully prepared bill in which he proposes to establish the signal service as a bureau of the War Department, having charge of weather predictions, army signal duty and military telegraph lines. The officers of the bureau, under Gen. Hazen's plan, will be, as at present, a chief signal officer with the rank of Brigadier Geueral, and such commissioned officers, sergeants and privates as are now provided by law. In a communication to the Secretary of War accompanying the proposed reorganization Gen. Hazen Btates that the scheme is prompted by experience and careful obser vation. Whatever the signal service has done and is now doing, he says, has been the result of disconnected legislation, while there is no doubt that the scope of its work is thoroughly defined, it would seem proper and of the highest importance that its organization should be fixed and its word defined by consecutive clauses under one act of organization and establishment without which the service will continue to, be the subject of great embarrassment and criticism. Gen. Hazen thinks that some such plan is necessary, as on several occasions the legal status of the service has been called into question, and an office charged with carrying out important matters under special acts of Congress should have' a fixed and definite organization and a proper (egal status. 8ILYER COEIAGE. Tu Miner erred in stating that Mr. Cleveland did not refer to silver coinage. Unfortunately for himself he did, and for tunately for the interests of the metal he advanced no argument againet its contin ued coinage which will bear dissection and stand. Mr. Cleveland says that at the close of the fiscal year there have been coined under the Bland law 203,882,554 silver dollars. This is about $4 per capita of the population of the country. The continued coinageof silver would add nearly 50 cents per head. The President sees dan ger in this fact and in the further tact that our gold exportations have increased dur ing the year. He also contends that we now have an abundance of silver coin for all our needs. There are many matters upon which the President is better informed than he is upon the silver question. He has much to learn in regard to it, if his remarks may be regarded as the measure of his know! edge of the subject. He employs the argu ments of his Republican predecessors, while facts disprove their soundness. Mr. Cleveland, like all other gold mono metallists, charges that the continued coinage of silver will drive out gold from the country. That was the favoritp argu ment of the late ex-President Arthur against the continued coinage ofjthe metal. Yet we have all the gold we want in circu lation, while there remains somewhere in the neighborhood of $185,000,000 lying idle in the United States Treasury, as against $80,000,000 of silver beside it. To sum it up in a few words, the whole question presents itself in this wise: ' The United States has a population of over 60,000,000. It has coined about 250, 000,000 standard silver dollars, or about $4 per head of its population. It has less than 80,000,000 of these standard silver dollars in the Treasury unrepresented by certificates, but at the rate certificates are now being issued every idle Bilver dollar will be circulating in the form of a paper currency representing its value within the next twelve months. Now, if there be danger in this condition of things, if gold is being driven from the country by it, we would ask how has it come to pass that during the last six or eight months France, which is a bi-me* allie country, has gained $36,000,000 of gold by importation, while losing $430,000 in silver? And why is it that France, with $550,000,000 of silver legal tender money, or $14 per bead, has been able to hold fast to $850,000,000 of gold, or $22.50 per head ? These are questions which are quite pertinent in the discussion of this subject, and in the answering of which gold mono metallists are compelled to abandon their theory that silver drives gold out of the country. Mr. Cleveland must advance more cogent reasons for the suspension of silver coinage to convince Congress of its necessity. In his message touching this question he over looked the fact that the calling in and pay ing of the remaing outstanding 3 per cent, bonds, the most of which are held by Na tional banks as the basis of their circula tion, will open a wider field for the circula tion of silver and silver certificates by rea son of many of these banks throwing up their charters. They cannot afford to pur case 4 or 4% per cents at the present pre mium to secure their circulation, hence many of them will pass in their charters and their circulation be withdrawn, thus affording room for a corresponding amount of silver certificates. We still adhere to the opinion that the coinagejof silverwill not be disturbed during this session of Congress. Before the gold bugs make any move to ward this end they must first devise some plan to keep National banks on their feet. Already two bills have been introduced in the House looking to the relief of these banks. The silver men in that body are masters of the situation and will so direct legislation upon that and kindred subjects as that the silver interests of the country shall not be imperilled. a 

CHARLES A. V. CONYBEARE. Speaking of this young Cornish Home Rule member of Parliament, who will visit Butte in the near future, the Centerville Mining Journal has the following: Hon. Charles A. V. Conybeare, who has been twice elected by the workingmen of Camborne division, Cornwall, England, to represent them in the British House of Commons, is one of the most promising men in that body. Mr. Conybeare is 32 years of age, and, although he is very wealthy, he has taken the side of the workingmen of Cornwall in every question that has been brought before the country*- He is an ardent supporter of Mr. Gladstone's home rule policy. He is an admirer of labor organizations, and has materially assisted Cornishmen in the re cent organization of a miners' union in that county. During the last session of the English Parliament Mr. Conybeare intro duced a bill providing for the better pro tection of miners working in the Cornish mines. A few days ago a gentleman of this place received a letter from Mr. Conybeare stat ing that it was his intention to visit Amer ica shortly and see for himself the relations that exist between capital and labor in this country. He wants [to study the la bor question in all its phases. It is his in tention to visit Butte city, and while here he will speak on the home rule policy and the question of miners' unions. There is probably no man that would receive such cordial reception in Butte as would Mr. Conybeare. He is a personal friend of Mr. Parnell, in matters of business is closely connected with Mr. Gladstone, and we be lieve that if he visits us, Americans, Eng lishmen and Irishmen would vie with each other in doing him honor. His visit would do much to cement in a firmer tie of friend ship the people of two nationalities who are now not working together with that harmony that common interests demand them to do. Let Mr. Conybeare come by all means. TOOLE AT WORK. Delegate Toole appeared before the House Committee on Territories, Wednes day, and made an argument in favor of the admission of Montana as a State. The gentleman, doubtless, stated that the last election developed the fact that the Territory has the requisite population to entitle it to a representation in the lower House; that it is abundantly able to meet the expenses and assume the responsibili ties of statehood; that it is out of debt, and that its great resources justify the presumption it can maintain a State gov ernment without imposing onerous taxes upon its citizens. These are facts suscept ible of proof, and nothing more is required by any rule or precedent established for the admission of Territories as States. While the House would unquestionably admit Montana upon Mr. Toole's showing the Republican Senate would require the assurance that two Republican United States Senators would be sent from Mon tana to Washington to maintain the su premacy of that party in the upper branch of Congress. Of course this assurance cannot be given and a bill for its admis sion would fail to pass that body during thiss sesion unless the same bill provide for the admission of a pronounced Repub- 1 lican Territory. The only one which can I now be relied upon as . safe for that party, having sufficient population to entitle it to statehood, is Dakota, Washington Terri tory, in view of the Democratic majority of 2,000 and over given for Voorhess, being considered doubtful notwithstanding its Republican Legislature. Montana is a Democratic Terri tory. A Democratic Legislature and majority of 3,718 for Mr. Toole over the most popular man in the Republican party in the Territory establishes this fast. Hence there is rea son to believe that if a bill were introduced in the House providing for the admission of Montana and Dakota ft would paw that body and be favorably considered in the Senate, as their joint admission would proserre the present political status of the Republican party in the latter branch of Congres s . However, should it fail there are grounds upon which to predicate the hope that the bill would go through at the next session of Congress. With a Democratic Senator from Indiana, another from California and the third from New Jersey to replace Re publican senators from those states and with the aid of Riddleberger—Independent —who seems disposed to act with the Dem ocrats and the help of Van Wyck, who wields a free lance at times, Montana and Dakota may be enrolled among the sister hood of states within the next eighteen months. THE 

HEALTH OF BUTTE. There are those living in and out of Butte who labor undèr the impression that a great deal of sickness prevails in the city aud that from causes which we will men tion the health of the place does not com pare favorably with that of others in the Territory. 8ome of our exchanges have taken their cue from remarks made, based upon this presumption, and commented in no flattering terms upon the city's health. This is all wrong, and does an in justice to Butte which we feel assured would not intentionally be done by our contemporaries or by residents of the place. Whatever mischief may have been wrought from the sources noted is the'result of a misapprehension of facts To arrive at a clear understanding as to the health of a city like Butte there are several things to be taken into considera tion, among which may be mentioned its population, the character and vocation of ts people, and its mortality report; the latter, as will be shown, not cutting such a figure in determining its health as the un informed may suppose. Biftte, or what is generally known as Butte—that is, the city proper with contiguous towns all included within a radius of one and one-half miles from the center of the place—has a popula tion of nearly 25.000 souls, more than double that of Helena, with its area of nine square miles. The city and its sub urbs have an average altitude of 5,800 feet above the sea level, fully exposed to the prevailing westerly winds which sweep over a broad expanse of mountainous country, uncontaminated by malaria or any im purities arising from the decay of organic matter. The air is pure, dry, bracing and invigorating. The altitude and exposure of the city precludes the possibility of its being otherwise. Hence we must look for the reason of whatever, of sickness there may be in Butte in artificial not in natural causes. As has been stated Butte 'and vicinity contain nearly 25,000 people. Many of these are families who came here with little or no means, and are compelled by force of circumstances to crowd into small ill-ven tilated dwellings, and to deprive them selves of many of the necessaries of life, which, in the aggregate, constitute a serious violation of every sanitary condi tion. The same class of people living in low malarious districts as they live here would die off daily by the dozen. Again a large percentage of the city's population is engaged in mining, which avocation, at the best, is attended with more or less danger to life and limb, and when fatal ac cidents occur, as they occasionally do, the death is charged up by unthinking, un informed outsiders to the ''unhealthiness of Butte." To this cause, and to the manner in which many of the laboring poor live may be ascribed four-fifths of the deaths which occur here. Even with these disadvantages, wlmt is really the sanitary Condition oi B tte? In a conversation yesterday with Dr. U. P, Hough, Chairman of the Board of Health a Miner reporter learned that, with the exception of about half a dozen cases of a mild form of scarlatina, there is no conta gious diseases existing in the city or vi cinity—in fact, that the health of the place is good. The Doctor contends that a mor tality report of the city and vicinity for the present year would show as small a percentage of deaths from natural causes, in proportion to its population, as any other place in Montana. The figures will bear the Doctor out in this assertion. Much has been said in regard to the fogs and smoke which sometimes settle upon the city and which many ignorantly sup pose are unhealthy and breed disease. Those « ho have lived in London and many other cities where fogs are the rule and not the exception will not be deceived by th is cry. They know better. As to the smoke the very slight percentage of the fumes of sulphur which it contains holds no germs of disease. On the contrary it is an excel lent disinfectant. This is shows by the en tire absence of cholera and many other epidemics at Swansea and in the neighbor hood of other large smelting and refining works elsewhere. No danger need be appre hended from the occasional smoke and fog which occasionally hover over and envelop the city. Taken altogether Butte is one of the healthiest cities in the West. Its location, its altitude, its surroundings, and the pure, cool mountain water which is conveyed in mains and pipes within the reach of nearly every door in the city, constitute a com bination of natural elements of health with which but few places are favored. The charge that it is otherwise than healthy is as unjust as it iB unfounded. We hope the City Council will call upon the sexton to make a monthly mortality report, stating age, sex and cause of death to the end that these charges concerning the city's health may be satisfactorily and forever silenced. Justice to Butte demands that such a re port be made. In commenting upon that portion of President Cleveland's message in which he refers to the request of the Secretary of the Treasury for more vault room in which to store silver, the Salt Lake Tribune grows indignant, and exclaims : "Rather, he prefers to add his sneer to the injustice which is being heaped upon silver, and to bewail the cost of sroriDg money. Was ever the head of a great na tion engaged in work like that before?" Yes, the head of a great nation has been engaged in just such work—not once, but several times. Ex-President Arthur was engaged in it, and it was his Secretary of the Treasury who first raised the whine about "more vault room" for silver. Grant signed the bill which demonetized silver, and before and since then every Republican Secretary of the Treasury has fought the metal with teeth and toe nail. The Repub lican party is an anti-silver party, and even in this Territory it is only recently the Republican press has looked with favor upon the coinage of the metal. In an article in the latest number of the North American Review, Mr. Pierre Loril lard, the millionaire tobacco manufacturer of New York, calls capital "condensed la bor" and maintains that wealth is only 1 held in trust for the benefit of the masses, I He ridicules the notion that the ad vocates of a reform that will give the work ers a larger share of the product of their toil are anarchists or communists, and makes the original suggestion for a labor congress, composed of one workingman, chosen by the workingmen of each Congres sional district, and a Senate, the members to be chosen by States, should meet for ono month in each year to discuss and settle disputed questions affecting employers and employes. Mr. Lorillard's views may not lead to any practical reforms, but it is a hopeful sign of the times when men like him who have become millionaires on manu factures have the courage tQ speak up for tbe workingmen.

Weinberger, the butcher, and sentenced Billy Baker on three charges and 30 days and costs in each case. Billy will eat bis Christmas dinner in the County Jail. Captain Shepherd is being put forward as a candidate for doorkeeper of the next Territorial Legislature. No better selec tion could be made, as the Captain is a staunch Democrat, and is capable of filling the office. Sam Meyers and Wm. Spinks, two of the finest pool players in Montana, will com mence a series of thirty-three games to night at Thompson's billiard parlors. They will play eleven games each night.

Judge Lippincott is getting along finely with bis twice broken limb. The Judge has the best of care and attention, and while he has a most painful member to remind him that this world is full of trials and tribulations, he can find some consolation in the thought that the accident might have been much worse—a rather poor one, but better than none at all. Hon. Thomas L. Napton has just re turned home and is quite ill. Mr. Napton has been toWashinington in attendance on the Supreme Court.

William Oliver and a number of fellow miners were below Silver Bow Junction Sunday and succeeded in having a good day's sport with all their greyhounds. Nineteen rabbits was the number they brought back with them. A good example to some of our would be sportsmen here in Butte. Corey, who is confined in the County Jail awaiting the action of the next Dis trict Court, and who made his escape from the jail some time ago but was recently capture«?and brought back, now wears a No. 11 Oregon boot. He complains that the boot does not fit him as he only wears No. 5 boot, but Deputy Shortsleeve thinks it is heavy enough to prevent his escape. Mr. Louis Villamaire received a dispatch from Manager Maguire last evening in which he is informed that Mr. Maguire has suc ceeded in engaging the Sullivan Combina tion and that they are booked for the 17th and 18th inst., at th^ Opera House in this city.

This place is not so widely known as some others in the Territory and may not have the advantages of which many of them boast, but it is not without its at tractions. It is beautifully located «»n Clark's Fork of theColumbia river, and, at present, is a place of considerable import ance, being the shipping point for a large amount of the freight sent into the Cœur d'Alene country. From every point of view the scenery is pleasing to the eye and is grand and sublime at many places. The forests on the mouutain sides are filled with game, large and small. They are, in deed, the hunter's paradise. The falls below the town, while notas grand as those of Niagara, are really fine, and will probably in time be utilized in moving vast machineries. If they were at Butte with the fine volume of water flowiug over them they would furnish power enough to run all the stamps that could be used upon the mountains of ore which abound in that great raining center. There are about 200 people at Thomp son, a large portion of them being engaged in freighting and teaming. The town is orderly and about as lively as any place of its size in the Territory. There are two hotels, the usual number of stores, other business houses and several saloons, all of which seem to be doing weiland prospering. A well-attended school, under the efficient supervision of Miss Curtiss, is one of the commendable features of Thompson. To sum up, Thompson is a lively, busy little burg, with possibilities of future great ness—if the magnificent water power shall be utilized. There is a tradition connected with these falls known only to a few, which I will write up in a future letter. It is all about an Indian maiden and her dusky lover, that in the hands of a novelist would form the basis upon which a very pretty and interesting tale could be woven. But in a matter of fact letter like this one, it would be decidedly out of place, so I will save it for the future and subscribe myself Emadee myself Emadee Meeting of County Commissioners. The Board of County Commissioners met in regular quarterly session 10 o'clock a. m. Monday. Members present were Wm. M. Jack, Chairman, Lee W. Foster and Wm. G. Pfouts, with H. S. Clark, County Clerk. Messrs. Wm. E. Hall, W. H. Young and Leopold Schmidt, County Commiseioners elect, were also present by invitation of Wm. M. Jack.
