NINE ARE DEADJN THE WRECK Majority of Victims Vere Occupants and Mail Cars List of Injured Will Foot up to About Thirty. OMAHA Nine persons are dead and thirty are injured as the result of a head-on collision between the Un ion Pacific's Overland Limited No. 2 and a westbound freight at Ah Say, Wyo.. a station five miles west of Rock Springs, at 3:42 a. m. Thursday. Fire instantly followed the collision and the dynamo car, mail car and diner on the Overland, were almost .entirely consumed. Both engines were destroyed, the engineer, who had mis taken his orders paying the price with his life. The bodies of the two jnail clerks and three cooks killed were .burned beyond recognition. The freight had orders to wait on the siding at Ah Say, a station five miles west of Rock, Wyo., for four teastbound passengers to pass. The train crew of the freight went wrong and when three passenger trains had passed the freight pulled out and a mile and a half west of Ah Say ran .into the Overland Limited. The conductor on the freight train, T)arrell, who escaped uninjured, has acknowledged it was the result of the .engineer and himself that the accident occurred. He said the orders were plain enough that they were to wait until four trains had passed before moving, but that either by a miscount or some way that has not been figured out the train was moved out onto the main track before the fourth train, which was the Overland Limited, had come along. As the wreck occurred six miles and a half from the state hospital, which is located at Rock Springs, all of the injured were hurried there for treatment and the dead were held to await the arrival of the coroner. A delas west of Granger had de layed the passengers until they were following one another and the crew had positive orders to wait for four passenger trains to pass, but they evi dently miscounted or misunderstood their orders, for they pulled out when the third passenger train had passed. The dead are: W. H. BUZBEE. first cook. Omaha. ED. ROSENBAUM, second cook, Oakland. JOHN LAWLESS, fourth cook. Og dcn or Oakland. J. F. PHILLIPAR, mail clerk, St. Joseph. ELECTRICIAN STIGERS.

The house received and ordered re ferred to one of the regular election committees a protest from the Fifth Congressional district of Illinois stat ing that Anthony Michalek, who was yesterday sworn in as a member of the house from that district is not a citizen of tae United States. The protest was presented by Mr. Rainey of that state, who asked for considera tion of the matter by a special com mittee.

ANNUAL CIVIL SERVICE REPORT Several Changes in the Rules Will Find Favor. WASHINGTON The twenty-sec-ond annual report of the United States civil service commission, con tains a recommendation that congress should authorize the collection of a fee from applicants for examination for the government service. Should this authority be given the report states that the commission wits issue a manual giving such detailed information regarding the examina tions as will make it unnecessary fo: the more intelligent applicants to make special preparation for the examina tion in some civil service school or in stitute. The amount of the fee. it is suggested should be a small one. The argument in its favor is that it would eliminate from the examination the larger number of persons who take them out of couriosity or to secure a hicher rating on the eligible list through re-examination. WAR COST JAPAN ABOUT $400,000,000 LONDON The correspondent of the Daily Teleeraph at Tokio sends a dispatch outlining the provisions of the Japanese budget.

HOUSE ORCANIZES THE SPEAKER ABOUT TO NOUNCE COMMITTEES. AN- HOLIDAY ADJOURNMENT SOON Panama Canal Emergency Appropria tion in the Senate But Very Little Legislation Looked for Before tha Holidays. WASHINGTON Speaker Cannon will announce the committees of the house Monday. This will practically complete the organization of the popu lar branch of the Fifty-ninth con gress. The committees so appointed will meet during the week for organi zation, the appointment of subcom mittees and the assignment to them of pending measures. In due time the subcommittees will report to the full committees and they in turn to the house. In this manner the wheels of legislation will be started. With the long session ahead, how ever, no important results are expect ed until after the holiday recess. The appropriation committee, which per haps has the heaviest task to per form, will first consider either the legislative or the District of Colum bia bills, but the outlook is that neith er of these measures will receive committee attention before the holi days. That there will be no lack of legis lative propositions is indicated by the 5,963 bills which have already been introduced in the house since the opening of this session. Many of these are known as private bills, af fecting only individual interests. It is usual to fix the holiday ad journment for about December 21 to allow members to reach their homes for Christmas. While no date thus far has been decided, this adjourn ment is fully expected Thursday, De cember 21. The first important measure which will receive the attention of the sen ate will be the Panama canal emerg ency appropriation bill, and its con sideration will begin this week. Some senators predict that it will become a law before the close of the week, but others have expressed the opinion that final action will be deferred until the week following. There will be no ef fort to prevent the passage of the bill in some shape, but there will be some opposition to the proposed resto ration of the $5,500,000 subtracted by the house from the amount to be ap propriated. Regardless of the sum, the bill will be utilized as a basis for the general discussion of the canal question. It is expected that the de bate will deal largely with the ques tion as to whether the canal shall be constructed on the sea level. There is some conflict of opinion as to whether the bill shall be referred to the committee on appropriations or to that on interoceanic canal. The general expectation is there will be comparatively little additional leg islation before the Christmas holi days. MORE MONEY NEEDED TO RUN COVERNMENT WASHINGTON A statement was issued by the appropriations commit tees of the senate and house sum marizing the estimates for appropria tions to be made at the present ses sion of congress for the fiscal year 1907.

The war department asks $S63,4G3 less than was appropriated last year and the rivers and harbors item, which last year amounted to $18,181,875, is omitted entirely this year. With these exceptions every department of the government has asked for more money than the current appropriation. Two Land Bills.

Mrs. Mary Mabel Rogers Dies on the Scaffold. WINDSOR, Vt. Mrs. Mary Mabel Rorers was hanged at the Vermont state prison at Windsor at 1:13 o'clock Friday afternoon for the murder of her husband. Marcus Rogers, at Ben nington, August 13, 1902. Mrs. Rogers was pronounced dead by the prison of ficials at 1:27. Only a comparatively few persons witnessed the hanging, the number be ing restricted to those permitted to at tend by the laws of Vermont. When the time for execution arriv ed a few short steps brought Mrs. Rogers to the stairs leading to the scaffold. She declined assistance, and unaided mounted steadily to the top, stopping exactly upon the center of the trap. She set down in a chair for a moment, and when asked if she had any final statement to make shook her head negatively. To bind the con demned woman with straps was the work of a minute only. A large black sack that was lying open upon the trap was brought up about her body and fastened around her neck, the noose was adjuted by one of the dep uties, and another deputy placed the black cap upon her head. The next step was the official announcement by the sheriff: "Mary M. Rogers, I now proceed to execute the sentence of the law, and may God have mercy on your soul." Hardly had the words been uttered when the trap was sprung. It was exactly 1:13 p. m. when the drop fell, and the woman was officially pro nounced dead at 1:27. In the opinion of the attending phy sician Mrs. Rogers' neck was not broken and death was due to stran gulation, although she was probably unconscious from the fall of the drop. CAVNASS OF SENATE OH STATEHOOD BILL WASHINGTON A canvass of the senate to ascertain the sentiment re garding a statehood bill indicates, says Senator Beveridge, chairman of the committee on territories, that a bill will be passed this session with a good majority.

SENATOR IS DEAD MITCHELL OF OREGON PASSES AWAY AT PORTLAND. DEATH FOLLOWS AN OPERATION Deceased Has Four Teeth Extracted and Slowly Succumbs From Effects Thereof Governor Will Appoint His Successor at Once. PORTLAND, Ore., United States Senator John H. Mitchell died at the Good Samaritan hospital in this city at 11:40 o'clock Friday, death resulting from complications which followed the removal of four teeth at a dental office yesterday morning. A hemorrhage of unusual severity followed the remov al of the teeth and despite the appli cation of the most powerful stytics known to the dental science the flow of blood could not be stayed. Pbysfc cians were summoned to the dental office, but the combined scientific knowledge of the dentists and physi cians could not stop the flow of blood. The senator's condition soon became alarming and it was decided to remove him to the hospital. When he reached the hospital he was in a very weak condition and it became apparent that unless the flow of blood was soon stopped life would pass out. Senator Mitchell had long been a sufferer from diabetes and other vitiat ing diseases and in his weakened phy sical condition rapidly succumbed to inevitable weakness following such violent hemorrhages and lapsed into a state orf semi-consciousness early in the evening. Four physicians. Dr. A. J. Giesy, Dr George W. Wilson, Dr. Emil Pohi and Dr. James O. C. WMley. worked over the senator and about 7 o'clock last night temporarily stopped the hemorrhage, but the relief was of but short duration and again the blood be gan to flow intermittently, continuing during the evening and through the night. At an early hour in the morn ing a severe vomiting spell further weakened the senator, and it became more and more apparent that the end was approaching. All during the night saline solution was injected into the veins to furnish more fluid for the cir culatory system and to stimulate the sluggish circulation. The diabetic coma Into which the senator lased grew more and more pronounced, despite the frequent use of powerful stimulants, and only occa sional evidences of a certain degree of mental activity rewarded the untir ing efforts of the physicians and nurses in attendance. Several hours before death the injection of saline solution was discontinued and more powerful heart stimulants resorted to, but with no effect on the rapidly sinking man. Gov. Chamberlain will appoint a successor to Senator Mitchell within a week. NEBRASKA BILLS IN HOUSE. Representative Hinshaw Introduces Four of Importance.

MONEY FOR CANAL. House Discusses Bill Appropriating $16,000,000. WASHINGTON With an opportu nitv for unlimited debate on the sub ject of the Panama canal, the house exhausted its oratory on that subject in a session of four and three-quarters hours Wednesday. The bill appropri ating $16,000,000 for canal work, which was the subject of discussion, will be read for amendment and placed on its final passage Thursday. The feature of the debate was the criticism indulged in by both republi cans and democrats regarding the in completeness of the statement of ex penditures and estimates furnished by the canal commission. Mr. Hepburn, in charge of the bill, m? je some effort to show that while detailed estimates for such work offered by expert en gineers who held responsible positions and had been selected entirely because of their fitness. Bourke Cockran of New York took decided exception to this attitude on the part of Mr. Hepburn, applied it as affecting all matters of appropriation and arraigned it as decidedly the wrong attitude of legislators. To en force his argument he read the senti ment of the president in his message for economy and scrutiny of appropria tions. The so-called "press agent" of the canal commission was criticised by several speakers and lack of defi nite information as to the existence of such a position was shown. The place was declared to carry a salary of $10, 000 a year and some curiosity was manifested to know what were its du ties. THR
