VESTERDAY'S SOON DISPATCHES. Washington, Dec. K—The Senate Mr. Spencer, of Alabama, introduced a bill to pro vide for the transfer of certain causes from the District, to the Circuit Court in Alabama. Ordered to be printed and to lie on the table. Thi: Hoche.— Reports from various commit tees are being made and acted on. None of them are important New York, Dec. 8.— The Herum says the message of President ( irant is a more credit able document, both in noint of reasoning and literary effort, than its predecesors from the same source. The President makes it clear enough that, ill his view, theBthree principal causes which have led to the disastrous defeat of his party, are: Prostration of business, the condition of the Southern States, and the unsuccessful ex periment of reforming the civil seivicc. This is not directly stated, but is necessarily im plied in the texture of his views on those snb jects. The sum of the message, so far as it has partv bearing, is the commitment of the Pres ident to the restoration of sound currency, an implied promise to treat the South with leni ency and justice, and abandon civil service reform, unless Congress supports it by legis lation. This is the programme ot President Grant for reinstating the Republican party. The president has got the Spanish tjuestion into such a state that it can be fanned into a flame whenever he thinks it expedient. He relies on the country to support him in a war in which the abolition of slavery in Cuba and the breaking of the yoke of colonial servitude will be the leading ideas, but Gen. Grant makes a stupendous mistake if he thinks he can play this desperate game With success. If he has pigeon-holed our just com plaint against Spain with such a purpose, he will have cause to regret the day when he meditated such a trick. The financial recommendations of the mes sage are sound in principle, but defective in details. The Tin« * considers the President's views on finances have undergone no change and his proposition to repeal legal tender clause is sound. . The President in stating he will sustain Kel docs not say wliat ho will do about Packard or Casey, which isa pity. The Tintes thinks the President's reference to Southern mutters is plain advice, given in kindness and frankness. Kays that journal: " We K,re sorry that he announces his in tention of abandoning civil service reform, unless Congress distinctly supports it by legis lation. It was an attempt that promised much and might have been made to yield great fruit With his recommendations as to spe cie payment and free banking, wc are in en tire sympathy." The Tribune considers it the' best message of the President, probably because written under the chastening of the late elections. It condemns his position toward Louisiana, but commends, mainly, nearly all the rest of the message. The Stitt says the President's message is reasonable and sound, theoretically, on hard money and a return to specie paymenis. But the President's arguments -are not as urgent as his theories are sound, while some of his plans for retiring our paper money and reviving gold and silver, as circulating medium, will provoke severe criticism, not only of in fiatieuists, but ot hard money men as well. With the exception of his recommendation of free banking, the views he now expresses con cerning currency, are but a reiteration of his veto of the green-back bill of last session. The IVmld says President (. rant and Sec retary Bristow are less in doubt than the Re publican press aud politicians as to the signifi cance of the overthrow of their party in the late elections. They have reached "a clear opinion by what amans, if by any means, the political révolution cau be stopped midway, aud the Democratic party hindered from tak ing possession ot every department of the Government in the elections of 187C: imme diate steps toward specie payments, not a promise, the execution of which is perpet ually postponed, and a reform of the tariff, to the end of obtaining larger revenue by lower duties on fewer articles. This, their concurrent advice, exhibits the President's aud the Secretary's appreciation at last of the great evils from which the country is suffering, and their admission that these evils are of legislative origin and admit of legislative remedy. Add to these the exorbi tances and usurpations of power on the part of the Federal Government, and Gen. Grant and Secretary Bristow will have discovered precisely the vulnerable points upon which the Democratic assault has been concentrated, and was irresistible. ty of They advise Congress to abandon the de fense of what is indefensible and to frustrate further Democratic victories, by themselves now doing wbat a despairing people have elected the next Democratic Congress to do. London, Dec. 8.- Rev. Mr. Makonochie, a well known Ritualistic clergyman, has been suspended for <i weeks from the exorcise of his clerical functions. Madrid, Dec. 8.— The Bishop of Urgel, un til lately a hot adherent of Don Carlos, has writjen a letter announcing his abandonment of the Carlist cause, and stating that he has advised Don Alphonso to take the same course.

SIGNIFICANCE OF DURELL'S RESIG NATION. - Pi •evident Grant Surprised on Receiving the Document. Future Tactics. ! Special tu Ï7. Y. Herald. 1 Washington, Dec. 8, 1874.—Yesterday morning there was received at the Executive Mansion, from New York, a letter from E. H. Durell, the substance of which was : " I here with tender my resignation as District Judge of the Louisiana District." The letter was unexpected, and* the President, who is often unmoved by political events, manifested some surprise at the course the Judge had taken. The Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Gen. Butler, who takes a lively interest in the prosperity and welfare of Louisiana, gave Mr. Durell's friend to understand that though Mr. Jewett had resigned his seat in Congress, the tacticsoftheSpeaker could not change his deter mination to press the matter to a vote, and the best thing for Judge Durell was to " step down and out." The result, it appears, was first vouchsafed to the afflicted community of New Orleans, and the name of E. H. Durell, added to that of Sherman of Ohio, Delehay of Kan sas, Story of Arkansas and Busteed ot Alabama, five United States District Judges who have left the bench withiu the past eighteen months. Tho resignation of Judge Durell, however, is of greater importance than all the othefs, anti its significance at this time cannot be overesti mated. In my correspondence published November 22, it was stated that the President's attention had been directed to the plan proposed by the opponents of Gov. Kellogg to get control of the Legislature in January next, report articles of impeachment agaiust Kellogg and Antoine, and thereby get control of the State and make it impossible for the President to interfere save by the use of Federal troops in dispersing the new Legislature and perpetuating the Kellogg Government at the point of the bayo net. This important information was im mediately telegraphed in full to New Orleans, and created, as has already beeu fully stated, the greatest excitement among all classes. The first result was the concentration in Washington of the leading friends of the Kel logg government. Senator West, perhaps justly, considers himself able ,to take care of the affairs of his State, hut for fear he might not. Attorney General Field, Appraiser Pitkin, Collector Casey, aud others, were sent on as reinforcements. Kellogg proposed to take the field iu person, but just now there is a lar.e convocation of Masonic Coinmanderies iu New Orleans, and it was urged upon Kellogg that he should remain to receive the distinguished visitors and not leave them to the Lieutenant Governor, whose graces as a barber might not favorably impress the Sir Knights from all parts of the United States. For this reason he remained in New Orleans, nnd left the Presi dent's brother-in-law to make the journey here alone. It is now in order to reiterate the statement first made in the Ihr old, and assert that the impending crisis in Louisiana is of the gravest importance. Between the date of the assem bling of Congress and the day when the holi day recess will begin, P. B. S. Pinchbeck will have to be recognized as Senator elect from Louisiana, or ou the 1th day of January next tho McEnery government will be in peaceable possession of the State government of Louis iana. Until the Senate, by beating Pinchbeck, admits the legality of the Kellogg government, Louisiana is without legislative recognition. The House has already recognized it by seating all but one member, and while heretofore Pinchbuck has not been seated l'or reasons of policy, the leading Republican Senators now realize the importance of speed ily giving him a. seat, though he may as speedily be unseated upon charges of a per sonal nature. Piachback, too, was the wit ness whose testimony at the coming session would have made liurcli's impeachment in evitable. The facts he could narrate would have been intolerable to the Republican advo cates in the House and Senate and make the administration, it is said, appear''more odious than ever. Durell has resigned. Pinch back's secrets are safe and the effort will bo made to seat him without delay. This, it is contended, will establish the legali ty of the Kellogg Government lor all purposes of Federal recognition in the event of inter ference by the supporters ol McEnery in 1872. The deftido will have become the de jure gov ernment, and the results of the IleraltVs legal discussion of the President's action will be be fore Congress in all their force nnd importance. But it is feared that l'iuchbaek cannot be seated in the first two weeks of the coming session, and while the recognition of the Kel logg Government is iu doubt the McEnery Government may quietly get possession of the State-House. in ; THE 

COURTS. FIFTH DISTRICT COURT. Mrs. St. Marc, wife of A. St Marc, who was some time ago convicted <»f embezzlement, and lately pardoned by Kellogg, has filed a petition for divorce, alleging that he had, at divers times, brutally beaten and maltreated her, and also setting up that fie was a convicted felon. Connected with the case there was brought to light the fact that Kellogg had no right t o pardon this man without the consent of the Senate, and his releaae was without sanction of law. The Sheriff' did not inquire into the legality of the pardon in time to secure St. Marc, and he has vamosed to parts unknown This oecnrred just before Sheriff' Fagan en tered into the office, and was probably due to the fact that in the hurry of Sheriff Patton s turning over the office the pardon was not scrutinized. SUPERIOR DISTRICT COURT. Western I'niou Telegraph Company Southern Atlantic Company and New Or leans, Mobile and Texas Railroad.—Judge John A. Campbell, for the railroad, has filed au answer in this case setting forth that the contract between the parties was made in 1870, aud subsequently to the date of the mortgage under which defendant acquired title to the rights of way of said corporation. Also, that détendant was not bound to adopt the same, but that, since their property and possession has been acquired, the plaintiff has remained in possession under said con tract, and this possession previously existing, and defendant has suffered the same, receiv ing the benefits and advantages which the same secured. The railroad company sub mits the case with a disavowal of even - act heretofore done by their co-defendants. Wintering in the Sot th.—W e are glad to note the arrival of several families from the North who have come to spend the winter here nnd elsewhere. We had the pleasure of extending a welcome to our friend Geo. W. Sutherland, of Chicago, who went ever to the parish of Yermilion with his family a few days ago to spend the winter with their friends and relatives. Mr. Sutherland is a true Northern gentlemen, who married a Southern lady some years ago, and we commend him to the* people ol Vermilion. He informs us that a large number of Northern people spend their winters in the South, but that most « >f them go to Florida. We hope our people will use their influence in making it known to their Northern Iriends that this section of Louisiana has a genial climate in winter, fully as healthful as that of Florida, and that they can come here and be as well provided for as they can in Florida, and avoid all the rigors j of their Northern winters.— Brash'.:? }■ -«•. i A Good Suggestion.—A writer in the Lon don Builder suggests that thick glass might be easily and cheaply cemented to the walls of hospitals, etc. It would be non-absorbent, imperishable, easily cleaned, readily repaired if damaged by accident, and, unlike paper and paint, would always be as good as at first. Glass can be cut or bent to conform to any required shape. It desired, the plates may be colored any cheerful tint. The non-ab sorbent quality is the most important for hos pitals and prisons, and, we should think, is worthy the consideration of architects. --Scien tific American.
