Seen as Characteristic Document by Democrats; Others' Ideas Incor porated, Republicans Say. In all private discussions among members of Congress in regard to the President's message to Congress, and in some public statements regarding it. there was speculation as to what extent the President's illness had handicapped him in its actual prepara tion. Democrats declared that Mr. Wil son's vigorous beliefs on public ques- ; tions were shown by the language of 1 ! the message to be unimpaired by his i long confinement and weakness, while in republican cloakroom gossip there I was evident a disposition to speculate i I on how far his advisers had gone in ' framing the details. | This disposition was manifest in a public statement by Senator Freling huysen, republican. New Jersey, de claring the document failed to take up some important public problems. I "The message." said Senator Freling huysen. "reflects the views of Attorney I General Palmer, Secretary of Labor Wilson and Samuel Gompers, and un doubtedly they assisted in its prepara ] tion." Senator Edge, republican. New Jer sey. said in a statement that it was rather academic and "certainly lacks the usual Wilson punch." It was characterized as "a genuine, unadulterated Wilson t essage" by Senator McKellar, democrat, Tennes see, and Senator Underwood, democrat, Alabama, declared it "up to the Presi dent's fine standard." Senator Hitch cock of Nebraska, the acting demo cratic, leader of the Senate, said that "few messages had pointed the way to more enlightened remedies for ex- j lsting evils." Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, the j republican Senate leader, h&d no com ment to make, but Representative Mondell of Wyoming, republican leader of the House, Issued a statement say- ! ing that while the message "contains j much that we can approve, it does not make any marked contribution toward the settlement of the perplexing ques tions of the day." 

ANARCHISTS' FAMILIES Camiaetti Wires Berkman and Goldman's Lawyers What Gov ernment's Intention Is. NEW YORK. December 3 (by the As sociated Press).?Families of anarchists are to be deported with them to soviet Russia, according to a telegram re ceived today by Henry Weinberger, counsel for Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman, from Anthony Cami netti, commissioner general ot immigra tion. "If you represent any alien ordered deported to Russia who has a family file your application for family to ac oompany such alien and the same will be given consideration," the message said. "The government will deport to soviet Russia at the earliest practi cable date." Weinberger, who has been ordered to deliver Berkman and Goldman at Ellis Island by Friday noon, said that his two clients and some threescore other radi cals migh't stay at the island indefinitely anless the United States recognized soviet Russia soon. It is his opinion that this country can deport no bne to soviet Russia without such .recognition. Nearly all the radicals at Ellis Island have ottered to pay their own way to soviet Russia, according to their counsel, Isaac Shorr. Caminetti's telegram, the attorney said, also made it cleir that radicals would be delivered to red guards In Russia when deported, and not to the hostile white guards. "#>' Weinberger's renewfcd r?qtlest for a stay of surrender of Berkman and Goldman till Monday was refused to day by the Department of Labor, and | he said they would be surrendered at j the time ordered. Berkman was ex pected to arrive here today from Chi : cago, with Miss Goldman following, him. Weinbergef said today he would institute habeaus corpus pro ceedings in both cases immediately after they had been surrendered.
