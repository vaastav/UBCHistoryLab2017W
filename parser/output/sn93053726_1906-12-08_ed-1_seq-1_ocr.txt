' ' London, Dec 8. The correspon dence between the state department at Washington and the foreign office here and ,that between Newfound land and the colonial office, detailing the circumstances leading to the es tablishment . of the fisheries modus Vivendi, was published here to-day. While the tone is conciliatory it hows that a wide chasm remains to be bridged. The dispatches com menced in October, 1905, with let ters from Secretary Root to Ambas sador Durand, dated October 12 and October 19, asking for an early in terview on the subject of the fisher ies and explaining at length the United States views of her treaty rights and urging that Great Britain take steps to secure the repeal of the Newfoundland laws conflicting there with. Foreign Secretary Grey, Feb ruary 2 last, through Ambassador Reld. dealt at length with Mr Root's observations and said he re gretted that he was unable to assent thereto without Important qualified' tlons. Mr Reld notified Secretary Grey July 20 that Mr Root disagreed with several of his views and added "I am Instructed to ask for such action as will prevent any interfer ence on any ground by officers of the Newfoundland government with American flBhermen when they go to exercise their treaty rights on the Newfoundland coast during the ap proaching fishing season. , Secretary Grey, replying August 14, said be observed "with much re gret that the wide divergence in tne views of the two governments dis closed by the correspondence makes it hopeless to expect an Immediate settlement." but he was ready to confer with the United States government with the view of arrang ing a modus Vivendi applicable only to the ensuing season. On September 12 Mr Reld wrote .Secretary Grey to the effect that the government of the United States "hears with the greatest concern that the divergence of views renders an Immediate settlement impossible. and suggesting the terms of the mo dus Vivendi. These were accepted by Secretary Grey September 25 where upon Mr Reid was authorised to rati fy them. All the communications of the state department to the foreign of fice were forwarded by the colonial office to the Newfoundland govern ment. The secretary for the colon ies. 'Lord Elgin, repeatedly urged a modification and a holding in abey ance of the Newfoundland ordinances to which objection was taken and unequivocally notified the Newfound land ministers that be was unable to assent to their view that the en forcement of the fishing act of 1906 was a matter of purely local concern. and tns'sted strongly on the right of the Imperil government to Intervene In questions touching the relations of the British empire with foreign states. In the last communication published Newfoundland was still deprecating the arrangement con sentlng to the use of purse seines and the engagement of local fisher men for work on American boats.

Favorable action by congress on the recom mendatlon of the president in his last annual message that an act be passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come to the United States Intending to be come American citizens, will go far to securing a continuance of tradi tional friendly relations between this country and Japan, in the opinion of Viscount Aoki, the Japanese am bassador. "Of course," said Vis count Aokl to-day, "no nation likes to see its subjects leave to take up a permanent abode in a foreign land and lose all relation with the father land, but in many cases it cannot be helped.' ' The ambassador expressed the be lief that there were not so many Japanese in this country to take ad vantage of naturalization if it were granted, but he thought that such an opportunity should . be afforded them along with the citizens of other countries. He said he did not think it probable that those Japanese who were emigrating In large numbers to Hawaii and the Pacific coast would avail themselves of naturalization, because of the fact that they repre sented the poorer classes and most of them ultimately returned to Jap an. Viscount Aoki said he had every confidence In the outcome of the test case which will be brought in the California courts. 

RATE CONTROVERSY. Decision Rendered Places Michigan Central In; Differential Class. Chicago, Deo 8. The Michigan Central railroad was placed in a dif ferential class by itself yesterday, when Lucius Tuttle, president of the Boston and Maine, as referee, reu dered a decision In the rate contro versy. By the terms of the decision the Michigan. Central is permitted to charge a rate to Boston, New York and Buffalo which 'is betweon the standard and the regular established differential rates. An execution I made In the case of the standard first class rate to Boston. ' Railroad men call the result a com promise and declare that it will com plicate the eastern rate situation. The statement was made that the ruling Is not regarded as an arbltra uon, nut simply as a decision, us there Is grave question whether the railroads under the new law have the right to arbitrate rate questions. The decision Is therefore not regarded as binding upon any road, but there Is reason to believe that It will be ob served, because each president gave his word to abide by it beforo the matter went to Mr Tuttle. The arbitrator decides tha the rates which he has given tlia MIcht gan Central shall be applied by ttt road only over Its eastern connection the New York Central. 

MAKES STRONG DENIAL Says President's Interest In Archbish op Ireland Wasn't Doe to Storer's - Influence Talks About Els Wife. Chicago, Dec 8. The Chicago Tri bune In Its Washington dispatches to day says that an extraordinary letter bus been addressed to Bellamy Storer to President Roosevelt and his cabi net in regard to bis dismissal from the post of ambassador of the United States - to Austria-Hungary. Mr Storer was dismissed because of his wife's supposed Interference in the affairs of the Roman Catholic! church and her alleged misuse of letters from the president It Is also charged that Mrs Storer meddled with French politics by taking part in anti-republican intrigues to pro mote tne marriage or V lctor Bona parte with a member of the Orleanist family. Both of these charges Mrs Storer denies and on the other hand declares that -the president's interest in the selection of Archbishop" Ireland as a cardinal was not due to Storer or to Storer's wife but to the presi dent alone. New York, Dec 8. When he was about to obey the edict of "al spirit which had told him to get ready to disentangle himself from this life," John Dola, a diminutive Pole, de cided to take some one with him Into the unknown. Consequently he en gaged in a pistol duel with a police man in West Thirteenth street early to-day and as a result of the encoun ter both Dola and the policeman are in hospitals. Albert Sellick, the pa trolman, has a slight bullet wound extending nearly the whole length of his back, while Dola has a seriously battered head as a result of having come into forcible contact with the officer's night stick. Both men will recover. , : , Sellick was patrolling h's beat when he was startled by ..he sound of a pistol shot, and the whistle of a bullet as It whizzed within a few inches of his head. As he turned Dola again discharged the revolver and the ball struck' the officer glancing blow on the hip and plow id its way up his pack to the shoulder, He rushed for the assailant, but he fore he reached him another bullet had sent the patrolman's hat spin' nlng Into the air.

An ambulance which was called by a brother officer carrl:d both the policeman and his assailant to a hospital. -

Although the Ger man foreign office does not believe that the shah of Persia is so near to death as is generally reported from Teheran, It is well understood that his passing cannot long be delayed, as his complicated liver and kidney maladies are In their final stages. Germany Is popularly supposed, in Great Britain and France especially, to be pursuing mysterious political objects with the ultimate design of acquiring territorial advantages In Persia. The German-policy, the As sociated Press Is informed, is simply equal trade privileges in Persia for all nations. In other words, the pol icy of Germany In Persia Is Identi cal In Its broad outlines with her Moroccan policy and will doubtless be held firmly Ifnecessary. The prin ciple of the German policy In Persia has been clearly explained to tbe for eign offices of Great Britain and Rus sia and misunderstandings, such aa those which made the Moroccan ques tion serious, are not likely to arise. The offer of the banking concession by the shah was voluntary and was part, of his plan to borrow money from Germany. He had already bor rowed through tbe British owned 'Imperial Bank of Persia," and the Russian owned Banque d'Escompte The activity and enterprise of the German traders led the shah's ad visers to suggest tbe establishment of a German bank In Pern's. The German foreign office considered that Germany already possessed the right to form such a bank under the most favored nation clause of the treaty between Persia and Germany and therefore the sbah'a offer aroused no particular feeling of gratitude. The foreign office event ually turned over tbe concession to a group of Berlin bankers who agreed to send representatives to Per sia some time this winter to aee If any money can be made out of the I concession. If no profits are dis cernible In a legitimate banking business no further steps will be tak en In the matter. Russia Is more the rival of Ger many for the trade of Persia than Great Britain, possessing ss she does a treaty under which the customs dues' on overland Imports are lower than those Imposed on sea borne 1m ports and both Great Britain and Germany have a community of In terest In obtaining an equal'zatlon of the seaport and land frontier dues.

Ihe Clansman," Thomas Dixon, Jr's, play, will not appear af Poll's on Saturday evening, December IB, as billed, for Mayor Thomas has stepped in and decided to step the play.' To-day he sent the following letter to Manager Harry Parsons of Poll's theater: - ' December 8 10 tne Manager of Poll's Theater, iiiy: Dear Sir: In regard to the per- lurmance or "Tne Clansman," which I understand is advertised to tal:e place at your theater on Saturday evening, December 15, 1900, I would respectiuiiy advise you that I have examined the play referred to and the book upon which it 1 founded with some care and am of tbe opinion that various scenes therein are of such a nature that they oucht not to do represented on the public stago in Waterbury. I have therefore to-day instructed the superintendent of do lice not to permit the production of ine Clansman" at your theater on the night in question. Tours very truly, Mavor. He also sent the following letter to superintendent of Police Beach: December 8 George M. Beach, Esq, Superinteu- aent or Police, City: uear bit: i send you herew'th a copy of a letter to-day sent to the manager of Poll's theater. You will in accordance with said letter, pre vent the production of the nl.iy men' Honed therein, giving due notice to the proprietor of the theater If an attempt Is made to produce said Slay, you will rause the arrest of the persons attempting to take any part therein, charging them wlt'i vio lation of section 1,347 of the general statutes, very truly yours. Mavor. A Democrat reporter ta'ked with Mayor Thorns to-day and ke why he had decided finally to prevet t the production. , He said h!a 'reasons were explained in the letter to M: Parsons. The mayor's act comes as a sur prise, especially when It was tbe general opinion that he was ret.onsl- ble for the statement of City C'erk Sandland In the early part o' the week that the production wnuM ev hlblt at Poll's. As be ha? real tbe book and seen the play ome timo ago he must have drawn Ms ronclu slons before the statement of the c'ty clerk waa given out. In Mr Sarjd land's opinion tbe show li a1! right. but the mayor has stepped ovr tbe clerk s head. Tbe announcement that the play would be stopped came as a urprise to the colored people, as to-lay they were around getting names for a pt tltlon that la to be presentod to ne aldermen on Monday evening askijg that the show be prevente.'. frrm ap pearing in this city. In view of too mayor's part. It will now be uuiecea- sary to present the petition. Section 1147 of the general tatrtes reads as follows: "Each one of iuy company of players who shsll r-nlaw- fully exhibit any theatric?.! shew for rstn shall be lined not mere than $50, and every person who shall un lawfully for gain exhibit In any pub lic hall any gamse.tricks.plays.rhows. tumbling, rope dsnrlng o ts of uncommon dexterity shall be laed not more than 8200." Manager Harry Parsons of Poll's talked with the writer this afa-uo.ra. and at that time ha had recrlved no letter from the mayor. He said that he would sot attempt to rt tn the production since tbe mayor had de cided to atop It. It is certainly wonderful the way pianos are being sold at the store of P.
