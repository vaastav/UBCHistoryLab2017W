X. f.. Pert 6. As a means of renwvinir all doubt a to the in Urpivtation of the tate law and constitution as they relate to what rtrsons are eliic.ble for jury er vice in North Carolina, the Lepisla t'.w committee of the North Caro lina Federation of Women' Club has divided dflin:tely to - ask the itrcral assembly for a declaratory .tatute making women eligible for such duty, Mr. Palmer Jerman, r-a;rman of the committee, announc ed tonight. "The . natu'e C. S. 2312 provides tl.at the board of ounty commission er? at the'r regular meeting on the f.is; Monday in June shall proceed to select from the tax returns of the preceeding year the names of all such (ersoiis as have paid all the taxes hspsd against them for the pre ceding year and of sufficient intelli gence." said Mrs. Jerman. "A list of the names thus selected shall be made -ut by the clerk of the board of coun ty commissioners and shall consti tute the jury list and shall be pre served as sueh." "men are 'persons' unquestion able and those possessed of the same qualifications as men are qualified as juror under the above section. "Those of a reactionary turn of mind, contend, however, that this stction is unconstitutional because the constitution. Art. 1. Sec. 13, prescrib es that no person shall be convicted of any crime but by unanimous ver iict of a jury of good and lawful men in open court, and therefore they argue that the statute which admits nil persons of pood character and who hnvj paid their taxes according to the refutations violates this section of the constitution. But C. S. 394!) provides that in the construction of statutes the following rule shall be observed: every word importing the masculine gender only shall extend and be applied to females as well as to males, unless the context clearly shows to the contrary. "The recactionaries say that the word men must be taken in the ex clusive meaning given to it at the time the constitution was adopted in 1868. Turn to the revised code, chapter 708, section 2, which was adopted in 1854, and it will be found that it was then provided that when the word men was used in legislation every word importing the masculine gender only may extend and be ap plied to females as well as males. The convention of 18G8 in framing the constitution legislated with knowl edge that the above was the settled law in this state. "This should settle the matter in the minds of all," she asserted. "But itidependent of the statute, it is well known that the word men in Eng lish has always embraced both sexes except when there, is an opposite meaning restricting it to males. Those who are familiar with the scriptures, which is the work best i kf'own to the majority of the people, i will find more than a hundred install-1 ces in which the word men is used in this generic sense. The same us-e of i the word in generic sense is to be found in Milton and other English writers. The word 'men' i used in the ?a ine sense in the Declaration of Iixlc j e.-.ikni;'. ' it is r.ot only sututory, but ac cording to common usiii;e tht the word 'men' includes both sexes un less there is something in the inme diate cot, text to show that it was intended to be restricted to the male sex. "When the constitution of 1M8 was adopted, it is true that men only were accustomed to sit on ju-, ries, but that has nothing to do with the meaining of a provision requiring that juries shall consist of 12 men.! There was nothing then that required the elimination of women and they were not intended to be barred out by this section when the time came, that in accordance with surroundings, they now being voters, they might be called in to decided controversies in court. "Besides it will be seen that this section applies only to criminal cases. There is no such provision as to civil trials. "It should be noticed also that in that very same article 7, section 7, it is provided, 'no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or priv.lcges from the community but in consideration of puM'c services." "This provision certainly was not intended to be restricted to males and the word 'men' must have the same meaning there as in above sec tion 13 of the same article. "Indeed, this provision," she said, "was in the Halifax constitution of 1776, when there waa not intended Washington, lec. The recom mendations i:i President Harding's message to congress comprises one of the most extensive legislative plans ever submitted and include: Abolition of the railroad labor board and substitution of a labor di vision of the interstate commerce commission with power to enforce its decisions against both carries and em ployes.

"Women now not only are 'nota ries public,' but county, treasurers, registers of deeds,' holders of other offices as well as voters." WIN HIM 

WITH FOOD, . SAYS MRS. MCKIMMON Girls' Club Feed Commissioners of. Edgecombe County with Satis factory Hesults Raleigh, Dec. 11. In a recent re port to Mrs. Jane McKimmon one of. I he home demonstration agents says: "If an agent wishes to win the con fidence and cooperation of the fathers and bro hers of a county let her start a food campaign of some description fur the women and girls. I have never met a man who is not interested in v hat to eat and how to prepare it better." This, states Mrs. MfKimmon, is very forcibly demonstrated by a young man who came to a lecture . and demonstration given to impress the value of milk and green vegeta bles in the diet.. The boy was thin, sick-looking, had a severe cough and was much inter ested in having the home demonstra tion agent weigh and measure him to determine just how far he was below normal. What the young woman told about the value of milk as a body builder impressed him very much and he said, i "I drink it when I can get it but I don't get it regularly. I have really, been advised to take my vita mines in a concentrated form but the medicine ' is too expensive for me to keep up. 1 1 am glad to hear you say I can get1 these vitamines in milk, green vege tables,' and fruit. ' "Yes," said the agent, "and you get your body builders and body regu-' tutors at the same time." He agreed, to try to secure a quart of milk a day end went off with a more whole some respect for the turnip greens, lettuce, and fruit on his own farm. Another instance of how the men are interested in food is given by Mrs. McKimmon as coming from Northampton county, where one of the clubs decided to serve a lunch to the county commissioners that they might see just what girls were get ting out of the club work. The girls baked the cake the day before the board meeting and then cooked the chicken in a steam pressure cooker. They had been taught food values and how to se,rve a well balanced meal. At the board meeting the menu consis.ed of chicken soup, chicken cro quettes, ham, creamed peas, potatoes, hot b'scuits, toma.o and lettuce sal ad, with peach Bavarian cream jind cake for dessert. A pot of good iot coffee went with the meal. The six teit guists expressed themselves as being well fed and well pleased and were emphatic in their praise of the work be i n,; done. 'the preparation of this meal was or.e of the best cooking lessons the ciub ever had and the readiness shown in the preparation and serv ing in a place where few convenien ces were to be had showed the devel opment of resourcefulness as well.
