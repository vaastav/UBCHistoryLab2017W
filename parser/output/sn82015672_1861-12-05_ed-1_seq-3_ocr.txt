Mr. Grimes offered a bill tendering the thanks of Congress to Commodore Dupont and those under his command, for the re cent victory at Port Royal. Laid aside till formation of standing committees. On motion of Mr. Foster, it was resolved that the Vice President appoint two mem bers to fill vacancies in the Board of Re gents of the Smithsonian Institute, caused by the death of Senator Douglas and ex pulsion of Jas. M. Mason. Mr. Chandler introduced a resolution to expel Breckinridge. Fowell took ground against it. As Mr. Breckinridge has al ready resigned, he could not be expelled. Mr. Trumbull insisted that he should be ex pelled, and offered a substitute to Chand ler's resolution as follows : Whereas, John C. Breckinridge, a mem ber of this body, has joined the enemies of his country and is now in arms against the government he has sworn to support ; therefore Resolved, That the traitor Breckinridge be expelled. Mr. Chandler accepted the substitute, and the resolution as thus rendered was unani mously adopted yeas 36, nays 0. Not voting or absent Bayard, Bright, John son of Tenn., Johnson of Mo., Pearce, Polk, Powell, Rice, Saulsbery and Willey. The following standing committees were announced. They are the same as at the lastsession, with the following changes : On Foreign Relations Mr. Hand, in place of Mr. Breckinridge. On Military Affairs Mr. Nesmith in place of Mr. Baker. On Public Lands Mr. Carlisle in place of Mr. Bingham. On Pensions Mr. Willey in place of Mr. Bingham. On Territories Messrs. Pomeroy and Carlisle in place of Baker and Breckinridge. The Committee on Enrolled Bills will consist of Browning, Willey, and Sauls bury. Mr. Wilson called attention to a list of colored persons confined in prisons in Washington, sent there by persons calling themselves Justices of the Peace. A report had been made by detective Allen to the Provost Marshal. Mr. Nelson introduced a resolution tor their release. Mr. Hale ad vocated the passage of the resolution. He remarked that we are now supporting the slaves of rebels for them daring the war. He thought the country tbe most corrupt from the Supreme Court down to any other in the world. The course of justice in this city was most extraordinary. He argued it was the duty of Congress to look into the administration of justice in this dis trict. Mr. Wilson remarked he had visited these poor persons in jail and witnessed the things of which he had spoKen, and the cruel condition in which the inmates were placed. He endorsed the views expressed by Mr. Hale as to the administration of justice in this District. He was willing mat ois resoluttou should be referred to the Judiciary Committee. Mr. Dougal suggested that instead of de nouncing the administration of justice in this District, they should propose a proper remedy and discuss the best mode ot re form. Mr. Fessenden, remarked to the Senators that during a former session, while it was proposed to make appropriations for a prop er prison in this city, the necessity for withholding the means for other purposes, viz: lor th prosecution of the war was urged. Aa to the judiciary system in this District, he had for years looked on the hopelessness of reform, but now he saw an opportunity for a change, and therefore trusted that tbe entire subject would be fully and properly dealt with. With re gard to fugitive slaves, there was much feeling on that question, and it was inti mately connected with the troubles in which the country is now involved. He would mete out justice and discriminate as to the facts. The debate was further con tinued. Among the speakers was Mr. Sum ner, in earnest approbation of bis col league's resolution, which was referred to tbe Committee on District of Columbia affairs. On motion of Mr. ClaTk, it was resolved that tbe Marshal of the District of Colum bia be requested to report to the Senate the names of all persons now confined in the jail of the city of Washington, with the causes of their commitment; the names of the Magestrates bv whom committed, the length of their imprisonment and tbe names of the persons who made the first arrest. On motion of Mr. Wilson, it was resolved that the laws now in force withii. the District of Columbia, relating to the arrest of fugitives from labor, together with all other laws concerning persons of color within the District of Columbia be referred to the Committee on the District of Colum bia; and that the Committee be further in structed to consider the expediency of abol irhing slavery in the District, with compen sation to the loyal owners of slaves. Mr. Wilkinson introduced a bill to abol ish the distinction between volunteers and regulars. Mr. Saulsbury offered a joint resolution which is as follows : Whereas, The people of tue State of Oirginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Tennessee, are in revolution against tbe Constitutional Government of the United States, and have assumed to secede from the Federal Union, to form aa independant government, and whereas, the Congress of the United States appro7ing the sentiments of the President in his annual Message that the ''Union must be preserved," and hence all dispens able means must be employed, and believing that kind and fraternal feeling between tne people of all the States is indispensable to the maintainance of a happy and prosper ous Union, and being willing to manifest such feeling Here the report for some cause or other saudenly broke off. Repobteel House. Mr. Maynard presented the cre dentials of Mr. Clemens, (Rep-) elected from the fourth district of Tennessee. He brief ly related the circumstances under which tbe election was held, saying that three members were elected in East Tennessee men who declare for the National Constitu tion and for the flag under which they had lived and under which they had hoped to pie On motion the credentials were referred to Committee on Elections. On motion of Mr. Washburne the Presi dent's Message was referred to the Com mittee: of tbe Whole on tbe state of the Unioa, and bis motion for priatiug 50,000 extra copies was referred to the Committee oti Printing. Mr. Dunn offered the follow ing : Whereas, Henry C. Burnett, a member 1 of this Hou3e from Kentucky, is in opett rebellion against the Government of the . United States ; therefore i Resolved, That the said Henry C. Bur- f nett be and he is hereby expelled from this House, and that the Governor of Kentucky ' be notified of his expulsion. Resolved, That the Sargeant-at-Arms be : directed not to pay Burnett's salary, which i has accrued since the close of the extra ses sion. Mr. Wickliffe said he had intended to prepare and propose something like an obituary notice of his colleague. Laugh ter. The latter was not as the resoluttou stated, in aimed rebellion, but at the head of the Provisional Government in Ken tucky a revolutionary convention. Not satisfied with the treatment of this govern ment, or with the course of his State, he (Burnett) has organized another govern ment for the better protection of tbe lives, property and liberty of the people of Ken tucky, and in this undertaking he has em ployed Simon Buckner, who is not only somewhat assimulated in name, but in deeds. Three times has the gallant State of Ken tucky declared by overwhelming majorities she would not leave the United States to run after strange gods. Notwithstanding her repeated declarations and in violation of the well known sentiments of the people of Kentucky, they had been told the ob ject of the convention and of the so-called Southern Confederacy, was to protect the rights of Kentucky. Kentucky acknowl edged her obligations and expressed her intention to fulfill them. The proclamation of the Governor of Kentucky deceived the people, but the Leg islature denounced it. Two messengers of peace were sent to the Executive of the United States, and one to the President of the Southern Confederacy to know what was intended to be done with Kentucky. The former said it was intended to main tain the laws and constitution of the United States, and that this was believed to be the will of the people of Kentucky. The latter declared he intended to respect tbe neu trality of Kentucky, as understood by the secession party of that State, but the South ern President did not tell them he had ma tured a plan to assail them at tbe different points, nor did he tell them there was on the statute book of the Southern govern ment a law providing money and means, not to sustain Kentucky against oppression, but to carry her into tbe Southern Confed eracy against the majority of two-thirds of the entire State. The Provisional Gover nor of Kentucky was sent to see the gov ernment at Richmond. Meanwhile Burnett is at the head of the new order ol affairs in the discharge of his duties, and an armed force has been gathered composed of young, reckless, desperate men, commanded by Buckner. In conclusion, Mr. Wickliffe said with the blessiDg of God I predict that by the 25th of December no rebel forces will be found on the soil ol Kentucky. Ap plause. The resolution for the expulsion of Bur nett was adopted. Adjourned. Washington, December 4. Mr. Gurley gave notice of his intt-iition to iutroduce a bill to confiscate all property belonging to persons in rebellion against tke government of the United States, including persona re cognized as slaves who shall be made tree men, to provide for their employment dur ing tbe war, their subsequent apprentice ship to loyal masters and their fiaai coloni zation. Mr. Lovejoy, from the Committee ou Ag riculture, reported tbe Homestead bill. After incidental debate the Homestead Sill was referred to the Committee on Pub lic Lands. Mr. Upton introduced a bill for the restor ation of Alexandria county to the District of Columbia. On motion of Vallandinjrbam, a resolution was adopted requesting tbe President to communicate to the House, if not incom patible with public iuterest, copies of any communication addressed to the Executive by the governments of England, Spain and France, in regard so the armed intervention proposed by them in the affairs of Mexico, and any other information he may have to communicate. Mr Hutch ns introduced a joint resolution condemning the rebellion, the consideration of which was postponed, also the following: Whereas, It has been represented that there are confined in the Government jail forty-five prisoners who are not charged with crime, but are represented as being slaves ; therefore Resolved, That the Committee for the District af Columbia be instructed to inquire into the truth of said report, and by what authority they are confined; who are the reported owners and what legislation if any is necessary to relieve them from im prisonment, and to prevent persons from being similarly imprisoned hereafter, and to report by bill or otherwise. Adopted. Mr. Pendleton introduced a resolution which was adopted, instructing the Com mittee on Military Affairs, to report what change, if any, is necessary in the mode of payment of soldiers who are held as prison ers of war. Mr. Cox introduced the following, which was referred to the Committee on the Judi ciary : Wherkas, Tbe exchange of prisoners in the present war has already been practiced indirectly, and as such exchange would not only increase the enlistments and vigor of our army, but subserve the highHt inter ests of humanity, and as such exchange does not involve the recognition of tbe reb els as a government; therefore Resolved, That the President of the Uni ted States be requested to inaugurate and systematize measures for the exchange of prisoners in the present war. Mr. Holman introduced a preamble re iterating the sentiments contained in the Crittenden Resolutions, adopted at the last session, in eff.-ct that the war was forced upon us by the disunionists and tbe only object in carrying it on by the United State is to re-establish (Jbedience to the Constitution and Union, and that wben these objects ate accomplished the war should cease, &c. Mr. Holman's proposition con cludes with a resolution re-affirming these sentiments. Oa motion of Mr. Stephens it was laid on the table by a vote of 71 against 65. Mr. Dunn offered a resolution instructing the Committee on Foreign Affairs to enquire into the practicability and expediency of procuring the rights of privileges of settle ment and citizenship in any part of this continent, in or on the adjacent islands ! South of the United States, for the habila- tion of free persons of African descent, who j may choose to emigrate thereto from tbe United States, for the formation of depend- ; ent colonies to be protected from foreign molestation. Mr. lovejoy and Mr. Conway severally Introduced propositions on the slavery ques tion, which were postponed. Mr. Watts, ! delegate from New Mexico, introduced a ' preamble, concluding with a resolution i requesting the Secretary of War to repo". 1 to the House what rue.-u-es have beeu. - r onght to be taken tu expose and ym -,, Major Synaer and oitier army orHMS who may be guilty of treason or cowardice in ; surrendering a larger and superior force of , United States soldiers to Texan troops, so S that those who are innocent may be relieved from blame, kc. Adopted. Mr, Hutchins asked leave to introduce 8 bill to abolish slavery in the District o: Columbia. Mr. Cox objected. Adjourned 

SPECIAL TO THE COMMERCIAL. Washington, Dec. 4. Mr. Saulsbury of Delaware, offered a resolution in the Sen ate to-day, appointing Messrs. Edward Ev erett, Geo. C. Pugh and Geo. M. Dallas, Chief Justice Taney and others, as Com missioners to meet a similar commission from the eeceded States, to arrange for a re storation of the Union, and a cessation of hostilities. This resolution was greeted with laughter in the Senate and laid aside. Senator Wilson has introduced a bill to punish officers or soldiers who shall return fugitives from slavery. Not much real business will be transact ed in either House, before the commence ment of the new year. Washington, Nov. 3. The Secretary the Treasury's Report will not be sent Congress before Friday. Baltimore, Dec. 3. The steamer James Adger, from Southampton, via Fayal and Azores, has arrived here. The Maryland Legislature met to-day. An organization will be effected to-morrow, when the. Governor's message will be delivered. New York, Dec. 4. The advices from St. Thomas via Panama, report that the captain of the privateer Jeff. Davis, was on board the British steamer Trent when Ma son and Slidell were taken from her. A Dutch fleet of 11 vessels were to be off Laguyra Nov. 7th, to demand satisfaction from Venezuela for having trampled on the Dutch flag. The Dutch government had concluded to allow United States vessels to remain in the ports 48 hours for coal. The West India Steamship Company, in consequence of the Trent affair, ordered all their agents to furnish no more coal to the vessels of the United States. The accounts from Bolivia are deplorable. The commanding General at lopez had or dered the execution of over 200 persons who were recently engaged in revolution ary movements. Among those who had been executed were Ex-President Cordova, General Heulosa, a number of priests and four Colonels. The steamer Northern Light from As pinwall Nov. 25th, has arrived, bringing $873,000 in treasure. The Captain reports that information had been received at Aspinwall, that tbe priva teer Sumter was at Martinique Nov. 9tb, and that the United States gun-boat Iro quois was within four hours sail of her.
