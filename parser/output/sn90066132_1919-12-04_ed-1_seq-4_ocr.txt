For the first time in my life I told my mother a lie. "John came away in such a hurry he did not have inuth cash and he left me a check. 1 will have to wait until Mr. Hicks comes to cash it. He will be here soon, 1 think,. Il is the proper thing; you know, mother dear, to have these affairs settled i mined lately. Do you know anything about father's finances?" Mother looked at me in utter sur price. "Why, of course not. tviy dear. At the beginning of each month your father always gave me two hundred dollars for household expenses, and one hundred for my own use, and he sent you one hundred dollars wn'-n you weren't home Someway I had a feeling that our income was about six hundred dollars a month. I don't know why I have this impression be cause your father never discussed it with me but he never failed to give me the allowance the first day of every month except this month when he was so ill. "He seemed rather worried at times, lately," mother continued, "and I think I should have asked him about things, but my dear, he was always in such great physical pain that I could not add to it by disturbing his j nn,V r,-r,l,r o rlo,r TV, V,;.o- v, (- e- rr imlnti in an" wa'- oh, i hope it wm , UJ,1.

FROM 110 class of workers is so much demanded as from school teachers. They are in fact the foster parents of the children. Into theirhands are committed the minds and bodies of the little ones in the formative years of their lives, and upon them depend to a large extent the future of the nation. Teachers watch over and care for children as though they were their own. They drill and train them for busi ness and for citizenship, instruct them in manners and morals and do for them things the parents have not time to do. They perform their work willingly, conseientiouusly and unselfishly. - What do we do for teachers in return? We pay them less than unskilled laborless than any class of labor. Other workers are well paid. Other classes have prospered.

It is a shame to Salem that teachers are so underpaid. Cost of living has advanced over 100 per cent in the past five years, cutting the buying power of the teacher's insignificant salaries in two. How can we expect teach ers to continue at their posts unless these intolerable. con ditions are remedied? Simple justice demands that the teachers be given more adequate pay. To accomplish this, a special school MftF IHCOrPTinM i electlon has been called for Monday and every citizen with Ul 11101 Ll I lUll the welfare of the cpmmunity at heart, should make it a point to vote for the measure authorizing an-increase of $150 in addition to present yearly salary for each teacher. This will add 50 cents a day to the pay of each teacher, and while not sufficient, will help in meeting the increased cost of existence. Washington, Bee. 4.

The attitude of the administration today with re gard to the peace treaty is that of "watchful waiting','., Believing that a great popular de mand for ratification will come from the country within a few weeks, Pres-t ident Wilson is keeping "hands off" the present situation, waiting for this urge to materialize, according to num erous indications. The president' refrained from di rectly mentioning the treaty in, his message to congress, it is believed, with ihe idea that further argumenf was useless. ' Need to be Kvldont The need for it, friends of the ad ministration predict, will steadily be come more apparent. They are look ing for events to convince the people that the treaty is desirable and that no other means of brining about of ficial peace will do. The president's silence, they assert, does not mean that he has given up the fight or that he s any less interested in ratifica tion than when he toured the coun try appealing for it. That-he is "wrap ped up in the treaty" was the expres sion used by some of his advisers In describing the situation. Third Term Cheers Kecommendation of Wilson for B third term by the state convention at j Pierre, S. I)., was interpreted by the president's supporters as endorsement of the treaty and as an answer to the arguments of those who claim the pact is so dead the democrats will not want to exhume it and meke ,it an issue in . 192 0. Opponents of the trenty openly scoff at the idea that the nation will demand ratification. They said that if any wave of popular sentiment for it were forthcoming it would have been apparent early in October, just after Wilson's tour. Many congress men returning to Washington after talking to their constituents say there is practically no interest in the treaty and that the people are rapidly for getting it in devoting their attention to the coal shortage and other press ing domestic problems. 400,009 Railroad Clerks To Get Wage Increases Washington.
