Mr. Rudolph announced at yester day's meeting: that the widow of an Armv officer had donated a handsome gold watch. the last of her late hus band's possessions, to be disposed of ax the committee desired for the benefit of the children. Applause greeted the reading of a let ter from Mrs. Marfra Tilton, 718 Taylor street northwest. inclosing a check for $5 toward the fund. "One dollar is from little Mildred Heitzler, nine years old." said the writer. "She wishes to contribute what she can to help the fund. The balance is for my two grand children. Elaine and William Ingram, age three and two years old. I wish them to know as they get older that they gave to the Children's Hospital." Moat Ask Donor Only Once. The attention of solicitors cannot be too strongly directed to the neces sity of living up to the widely adver tised plan whereby a prospective donor is approached once, and once only. Departure from this rule, re sulting from unauthorized appeals, tend not only to discredit the business methods adopted by the campaign of ficials. but will, in the long run, de tract from the financial results. More than one case has been brought to the attention of those in charge of the drive that make It appear as if philanthropic members of teams think this is a sort of "free-for-all." One philanthropic resident of Wash ington has been approached on no less than four different occasions: imagine her feelingB in the face of the an nouncement that workers approach only those -whose cards they have drawn. A member of one team yesterday, after considerable difficulty and time spent in making an appointment, in terviewed a distinguished retired Army officer whose card she had drawn and from whom she hoped for a generous subscription. The dona tion did prove to be of three figrures, hot had already been made, a busi ness friend of the officer having come around early and gotten the money. The Army man's time and patience had been trespassed on, while the solicitor had sacrificed her own time and convenience on a fruitless errand. "This sort of thing is bad business; how bad the offenders apparently do not appreciate," said one of the head workers today, "and I regret to say that men. more used to strict busi ness methods than women, have de parted from the rule laid down more often than women. If this sort of thing doesn't stop there will be an after effect of dissatisfaction on the part of the general public that will take a long while to live down." Members of the Washington Auto motive Trade Association at their final meeting of the year Monday night at the City Club voted to donate $500 to the cause. Jirtd for Fond Shown. What is the pressing need for this $100,000? A visit to the institution, 13th and W streets northwest, is cal culated to convince any one of the fact that this sum. and more, too. could be spent to the advantage of hospital and of community, this being the only hospital ministering exclu sively to children. In the infants' ward yesterday, when one such visi tor was taken around, were eight mites, victims of malnutrition. Four occupied cribs, the other four occu pying a comfortable railed-in in closure on a mattress-covered floor. Through an adjoining window the warm rays of the sun fell on the tiny sleepers, whose blanched faces and emaciated bodies showed only too plainly the lack of proper nourish ment. The ward was their sun parlor. No glass-inclosed porch, the boon of the convalescent, is attached to the room, and this is one instance where the dollars of the philanthropic pub lic will be put to good advantage. A stroll through the medical and surgical wards of both white and col ored children and a view of their crib-filled interiors presents eloquent testimonials to the work that is be ing ca.rried on under difficulties by the physicians and nurses. Here again the visitor can visualize at a glance the wonders that his or her dollars ?will acocmplish. Visit to Dispensary. Proceed to the dispensary and pic ture from thirty to sixty mothers daily bringing their precious offspring to the doctors for treatment or admis sion. Follow the child to the glass partitioned cubicle wherein it is plac ed for forty-eight hours for observa tion and diagnosis in order that any contagious disease can be readily de tected and the patient assigned to one of the hospitals in the city special izing on maladies of this character. Proceed with the youngtser to the well lighted operating room and note on the way that there is no covered passage between the ward and the surgeon. If it rains or it is too cold outdoors the trip must be made through various rooms and hallways to the inconvenience of the little pa tient and the nurse. Once more a long-felt necessity for money is ap parent. Enter the operating room and learn of the many things it requires to be up to date, and dwell on the realiza tion that part of the fund, now, being sought, is to be applied here. Look at the plumbing and the fixtures, and marvel at the results that are being attained under the present conditions by the resident physicians and the nurses in their work. Personnel of Team*.

CARRANZA GIVEN ABSOLUTE POWER TO DEAL WITH U. S. (Continued from First Page.) at Mexico City. Representations were quickly made to the Mexican govern ment and within a few hours the ma chinery, including the military, was seeking to rescue Rowe. In reporting the liberation of Rowo the vice consul said: "The government troops and the state authorities exercised all dili gence in effecting the liberty of Rowe. and as a mere matter of justice this should be stated, as everything is due to the efficacy with which the authori ties moved in the matter." Luis Cabrera, secretary of the trCas- ? ury under Carranza, and whose brother 1 is governor of the state of Puebla. 1 where the Jenkins kidnaping took place, has taken an active part in the J Mexican government's prosecution of ' the case against Jenkins, according to advices received here. In a statement prepared for the press of Mexico City Cabrera said that Jenkins might be liberated on bond, but that the Ameri can government "now prefers to set him free by means of threats." "It is inexplicable." Cabrera was quoted as saying, "that the American government should have requested the immediate release of Jenkins, even be fore the court decision was rendered. The United States government is seek ing to have Jenkins declared innocent even before the Investigations of the case are completed. And if the insin uations of another government in pure ly administrative matters cannot be accepted, how can foreign imposition be permitted to hurry a final sentence in a case which is of the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts?" Thwart Mexican Indians' Plan to Secure U. S. Arms PHOENIX, Ariz., December 3.?An expedition of Yaqul Indians from So nora to Tucson, Ariz., to procure arms and ammunition to carry on their warfare against the Mexican federal government was believed to have been halted by the prompt ac tion of Gov. De La Huerta of Sonora and Acting Gov. Slmms of Arizona, it was announced yesterday at Mr. Simms' office. Mr. Simms first received a message from the Mexican governor which warned him that the Yaquis were ap proaching the international boundary on their way to Tucson to get the munitions. Mr. Simms said he then telegraphed Col. Carnahan, command ing the United States troops at No gales. and to the sheriff of Pima county to intercept the Indians. Al though he has not heard from the offioers. he said he believed that they met with success, for a message from the governor of Sonora thanked him for hanfl)irig satisfactorily the inci dent. Defense of Mexico M>.v i Published in Peru LIMA. Peru, Decmber 2.?Newspa pers here publish a half-column let ter from the Mexican legation giving the Mexican view of the controversy which has arisen between that coun try and the United States over the imprisonment of W. O. Jenkins, United States consular agent at Puebla. The letter quotes a cablegram from the Mexican foreign office, which follows the lines drawn in the Mexican re ply to the American note, in which It was alleged Jenkins was impris oned for "making false statements during judicial proceedings" and re fused to secure his liberty by giving bail. ^ , After declaring the American gov ernment "must await definite sentence hy the Puebla court, as the Mexican authorities desire to proceed with justice," the legation's letter says: "This cablegram shows that the Mexican government In this, as in all other cases, is proceeding with strict observance of legal precepts." REVISE PLAN TO EXTEND MARYLAND AVENUE EAST For the extension of Maryland ave nue east of 15th street to Anacostia river, the District Commissioners to- I day submitted to Chairman Mapes of the House District committee, a re vised proposal, with recommendations that it should be passed at an early date. This report points out that Mary land avenue is one of the main ave nues radiating from the Capitol, and furnishes a direct route to Anacostia Park, which is being rapidly devel oped. Under the highway act the Commis sioners are authorized to institute condemnation proceedings, and to as sess the entire costs against abutting t property owjiers as improvements. In I view of the fact that Maryland ave | nue is 160 feet wide, the Commission . ers believe that to carry on this work j under the general act would be In equitable to the property owners af I fected. Therefore, they recommend I that one-half of the cost be assessed | as benefits. They point out that usu j ally where the entire costs are assess | ed It is on streets ninety feet wide. As Maryland avenue is 160 feet, they said ! a more equitable assessment would : probably be nine-sixteenths of the cost. CONTEMPT ACTION AGAINST MIRS IS EXPECTED SOON Justice Department Also May Cite Operators?Has Col lected Mass of Evidence. IiVPIAN'ArOTiIS, Tnd.. llprpmbi-r 3 (by the Associated Press).?Citations for contempt of court, directed against members of the Tinted ,\lin? Workers of America, and possibly against coal mine owners, are expect ed with'." \he next twenty-four hours as the government's next step in its efforts to brine about an end of the strike of bituminous coal miners. It has become known that a masn of evidence against alleged violations of the injunction against the strike is sued by United States District Judge Anderson has been collected by agents of the Department of Justice and that proceedings will be insti tuted immediately. Government attorneys take the position that statements made by individual miners, which might be viewed as encouragement of the strike or agreement by any two mem bers to refrain from work constitute violation of the injunction. Little Change in Coai Situation: Further Cut in Industry Is Prospect CHICAGO, December 3.?Further disruption of national industry be cause of the fuel shortage broughv about by the strike of bituminous coai miners was in prospect today. Re gional directors of railroadB had au thority to annul passenger "trains where the public would be least In convenienced and many additional I manufacturing plants throughout the country faced shutdowns. Only in isolated instances were there reports of a change of front on the part of the miners. Generally the workers adhered to their atti tude of remaining away from the mines until better terms than the 14 per cent wage increase were forth coming. Some regional coal directors es timated that with reductions of working staff's already made or threatened, should the strike not be broken immediately, the number of employes thrown out of work soon would surpass several times over the approximately 400,000 mine workers involved in the walkout. The Bethlehem Steel Company has been forced to order banked one of its North Lebanon, Pa., stacks. Among the industries to close or facing a shutdown in the west was the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in Montana. Officials announced that preparations were being made to close all that company's mines and smelters In Montana, which would throw 12.000 men out of employment. Trenton, Mo., Miners to Besume. TRENTON, Mo., December 3.? Trenton coal miners gave notice yes terday of their intention to return to work in the mine here, the output of which is devoted to local use. "We are Americans and will not remain idle and see our neighbors suffer." repre sentatives of the miners said. They are returning to work at the old wage scale. No Change in Pittsburgh Section PITTSBURGH, Pa.. December 3.? Reports from the Pittsburgh district and the central and western coal fields today indicated that practically all union mines were still "down," and that striking miners were standing firm in their determination not to go to work until the question of wages has been definitely settled.

COAL RESTRICTION MEASURES TO HIT D. C. WITHIN WEEK Every Effort to Be Made to i i Keep Preferred Classes of Consumers Supplied. Steps for the conservation of Wash ington's dwindling: supplies of coal are expected to be taken within the next few days, according' to informa tion today, and within a week, it is expected, restrictive measures de signed to savfi coal will be in effect. Every effort is to be made t?> keep the five preferred classes of coal con sumers. together with domestic users, supplied with enough coal to keep them in operation. The live are rail roads nnd inland and coastwise traffic. Army, Navy knd government institu ( tions. state, county and municipal governments and institutions, public utilities, such as street railways, evec tric light and power companies, gas and water companies, etc.. and retail dealers supplying domestic con sumers. It also was stated that industrial plants manufacturing necessary com modities are to be kept supplied with fuel practically on the same basis as the classes in the preferred list. Such plants, it was stated, would include bakeries, dairies operating power ma chinery, establishments manufacturing or preparing foods, clothing manufac tories and the like. Preference to Householders. Hetnil stores handling foods and clothing, it was stated, will be classed with domestic consumers, the latter, however, being given preference in supplying coal. A ban is expected to be placed on all | illuminated signs using electric cur rent and on theaters, motion picture ! houses and other places of amusement. | This step is not expected to bo taken, j however, except under compulsion of extreme necessity, it was intimated, though no direct statement to this ef fect was obtainable. Most retail dealers in Washington are selling coal only in limited quanti ties. it was stated today, this plan having been adopted alntut a week ago. In most cases orders are not accepted for more than two tons of coal at a time, though a few dealers are declining to take orders for larger quantities than one ton at a time. No advance in prices has been made, i it was stated, and none is to be made the sole effort being to make the supplies spread over as many users as possible. Representatives of several large coal mining companies were in the ?'}y today conferring with officials of the railroad administration, the fuel administration, the central ooal committee and large local users of coal. These men stated that so far as they^ have been able to learn by careful investigations and surveys of the various ooal fleKIs. no improve ment is to be expected in the fuel situation in the immediate future, except in V.e remote contingency that the coal miners experience a change of heart and Inaugurate a "back-to the-mines" movement. Xo Receipts In Fifteen Day*. At the offlcoa of the Washington Gas Light Company and the Potomac Electrio Power Company no informa tion could be obtained as to the re serves of coal on band for production I of gas and electric power. At the otfloe of the former company it was learned that no shipments of bitumi- I nous coal had been received in the last fifteen days. The Potomac Electric Power Com pany has been trying, during the last twenty-four hours, to get a clear statement regarding restrictions from the federal officials. "We learned from the newspapers that the fuel'administrator had issued a request, described as virtually an informal order, calling upon public I utilities to curtail fuel usage by cut-I ting off power to electric signs, show windows and other 'non-essentials.' " I said John C. McLaughlin, commercial manager of the Potomac company. *'I I sent first to the fuel administration, i then to the railroad administration, for a copy of the request. At neither place wepe 'they able to furnish a copy. "As a general policy we will do whatever we can to aid the govern ment in regulating the use of fuel and in conserving the supply. We have sent out investigators today to make a survey of the local use of electric power and will request economy by our patrons. But we cannot isnue or ders to them. We <%nnot sit in judg ment regarding their use of lights. We can make no enforcable regula tions. "TVhen the fuel administration is sues orders saying who may and who may not use power for certain pur poses, we can take those orders and carry them out to the limit of our right. But until there is definite offi cial movement in that direction we can act only along general, not spe cific, liner to save coal by generating and distributing less power." Strpi for Conservation. Instructions were issued last night by Director General Hfnes urging regional directors to review the gen eral coal situation in their districts carefully with a view to further coal conservation measures. The regional directors have been authorized to eliminate passenger trains which can be spared with the least inconveni ence to the traveling public, it was announced. Brice Clagett, assistant to the di rector general, said today that any measures looking toward conserva tion of coal by the railroads through elimination of passenger trains in the Allegheny region, which includes Washington, would be taken by L. W. Baldwin, regional director, with offices in Philadelphia. It was explained that the central j coal committee, of which Henry B. Spencer is chairman, with offices in the Hurley-Wright building, at 18th street and Pennsylvania avenue, has not seen fit to ask quantity con sumers of coal in the District of Co lumbia to curtain their consumption. Mr. Baldwin, it was explained, is in complete charge of coal distribution in the Allegheny district and any or ders for curtailment, either to rail roads or to private consumers, would necessarily come from him. Intimation was made that the Alle PROPOSED HOME FOR CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF UNITED STATES. i i Structure to he erected on site of the historic W. W.

IOWA IS MINING COAL IN CAPITOL GROUNDS DIC8 MOINES, Iowa, December 3. ?The state of Iowa will operate one small coal producing' piece of property at least. Workmen today were stripping: the earth from one corner of the state capitol grounds and steam shovels will be put in Immediately to lift out coal dis covered there yesterday. The coal was found by workmen drilling for a foundation for a new building and is a vein about four feet deep. A mine, years ago. was located near where the coal was found yester day. The fuel to be dug by the steam shovels will be placed at the disposal of the state fuel adminis trator. gheny region is more plentifully sup- ! pli<?l with coal than any other region ' and that the problem in this region is not one of curtailment, but of i allocation of coal to the other regions more in need of fuel. Fuel Administrator Garfield is ex pected back from VVilliamstown. Mass., tomorrow. I'r^uPtlon Again l<ngging. Further reports that coal produc- I tion. which was on the increase last week, is lagging?in some regions to an alarming degree?were received 1 today by the Department of Justice, i A number of telegrams, notably from 1 the middle west fields, brought in- j formation that many miners desire earnestly to return to work at the | 14 per cent wage increase offered, but : I that radical threats are keeping them idle. Several requests were ] ! made for soldier protection of mini' J workers. Decision regarding action now rests with Assistant Attorney General Ames. COMMITTEE TO STUDY LOCAL COAL SITUATION Board of Trade members appointed I by ("apt. .lames F. Oyster, newly elect- i ed president of the board, to invest!- I gate and report on the local coal sit-! uatlon are William Clabaugh, chnlr man: W. W. Griffith, W. Hamilton Smith, William A. Leetch and .lohn h. Newbold. Mr. Deetch is Washington manager for the Consotidation Coal Company, operating in the Georges Creek and j Upper Potomac fields in the vicinity ' of Cumberland, Md. It is from these fields that Washington draws the greater part of Its supplies of bitu minous coal. The committee is to begin its work 1 at once, starting first on a compre hensive survey of local supplies and reserves, and giving attention to the | fields from which the District of Co lumbia may reasonably expect to draw supplies of soft coal. 

KANSAS VOLUNTEERS SPEED UP PRODUCTION PITTSBURG. Kas., December 3.? Speeding up of work in the strip pits by volunteer diggers, shipment of more coal to western Kansas and a call for meeting late today of local railroad brotherhood members to de termine their attitude toward hand ling the coal which the volunteers are taking out are developments in the district where state receivers are operating mines to relieve the fuel shortage occasioned by the miners' strike. Another contingent of volunteer miners is expected to arrive in the district during the day. "Before the week is over we will be getting out about seventy-five cars per day," Gov. Henry J. Allen said, "and by the end of next week we will probably double that amount. The strip pits, it is expected, will be operated at full capacity in a short time and new pits will also be opened up. increasing the output to about 300,000 tons per month. 13,000 VOTE TO RETURN IN FAIRMONT DISTRICT FAIRMONT.

RAILROAD MESSAGE DEPENDSONBILLS President Will Not Begin Its Preparation Until After Conferences. President Wilson will not. begin I preparation of his special message to | Congress on the railroad situation 1 until Director General Mines has conferred with Senator Cummins and ! Representative Ksch, chairmen of the ( Senate and House interstate com- 1 I merce committees. on the pending! railroad bills, it was said today at i I the White House. j It was intimated that the status of I the legislation might be such that; j the President would not regard it as i | necessary to address Congress on the j : subject.

I these differences will have to be com-, posed in conference. | In view of the President's statement j to Congress yesterday that he expect ed to treat the railroad question in a separate message, there has been I speculation in official and railroad circles as to whether lie intended to adhere to his previously announced plan to return the roads to private! operation by January 1. . Some officials and railroad men are! of the personal opinion that the Pres- j ident may await action of Congress on the pending legislation. Those at ! the White House refuse, however, to comment. Actual consideration of the rail road bill was begun in the Senate yes terday and it is the purpose of Sen ator Cummins, chairman of the in terstate commerce committee, to keep the bill before the Senate daily until it is disposed of. Senator Cummins, presenting the report of the Senate committee on the railroad bill, explained that it was the committee's hope that it might be substituted for the measure recently adopted by the House. Senator Cummins said his only rea son for advocating private ownership and operation of the railroads was because he believed that only in that way could the best service be given. Discussing the financial situation of the railroad administration. Sen- I ator Cummins said that if on January j 1 the railroads paid the government j all they owe and the government j paid the roads all it owed the balance I in favor of the roads would be some- I thing more than $650,000,000. BIG 

TURBINE INSTALLED ! IN BENNING POWER PLANT The largest turbine ever constructed in this territory bas been completed and installed in the Kenning power plant of the Potomac Electric Power Company, according to an announce ment made today by company officials. The unit alone is said to have cost $300,000, while the total cost, includ ing the adding of a wing to the main building, will be in excess of $500,000, according to an estimate of L. E. Sin clair, general superintendent of the company. "This turbine." said Mr. Sinclair, "al though the largest yet installed, is expected to prove economical in Its operation. Some of the more expen sive units will be held in reserve when the new one is switched on." The new turbine is of 20,000 kilo watts, or 30,000 horsepower, and an entirely new section had to be added on to the main Uuilding for its ac commodation. It was manufactured and installed by the General Electric Company and will be put into oper ation after a final inspection by offi cials of this company. Mr. Sinclair said that it would prob I ably be three or four days before the necessary inspection and final adjust ments would be made, and the new turbine switched in'to line. Mine Operatorsr From All Sections Here to Work Out Details of Wage Increase Mine operators from all parts of the country gathered here today to work out details of the 14 per cent wage in crease suggested by the government for the bituminous coal miners. While the sessions officially were restricted to operators located in the central competitive field, representatives from the other sections were on hand to gather facts on which to base their own adjustments. It was said that the findings of the central field committee probably would be submitted to Fuel Adminis trator Garfield for ratification, but that several days would be needed to work out problems presented. Continued optimism in official circles was marked, although production fig ures available showed no increase in daily tonnage. This is now estimated j semi-ofticially at better than 40 per cent of normal. Operators represent ing the Alabama fields, gathered for the wage discussion, said production which had been normal there had dropped to about 80 per cent, union representatives being active in at tempting to call men out. Central Pennsylvania mine owners reported partial production, while West Vir ginia, Kentucky and Tennessee repre sentatives were confident that the mine outputs soon would be back to normal. In the central district, however, hardly a pound of coal is being pro duced except by wagon mines and a strip pit or two, operators said.
