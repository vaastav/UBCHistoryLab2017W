THE DAY'S OPERATIONS IN STOCKS. Heavy speculative liquidation and active bear pressure In the last hour of trading were re sponsible for sharp d-clines throughout the 1 1st. sjtth substantial net losses at the close. In the early transactions prices were comparative* ilrm Initial dealings were moderately heav> tad indications pointed toward higher prices for the day. In the afternoon estimates of to-day s bank statement foreshadowed a material loss in cash holdings, and. as a consequence, traders began to hammer prices, while certain Interests -n Manhattan and oth:-r manipulated special- SU operated for lower prices, on the theoo that public traders were overloaded with the niks that recently have enjoyed marked i price improvement. It was nothing more than a Kliakhiß out proems. There were no ad\erse ,vs developments and nothing upon which to base a legitimate movement for cheaper Quota tions. Amalgamated Copper lost over 3 points, but the star performer of the day was Man hattan. which showed a net d.cllne at the close of nearly 1 points.

The new indu.mal 'hares, which represent consolidations of long SS&ed industries, are particularly attrac £; at current prices, especially the preferred shares that are paying t and 7 per cent «hrf dends and returning at present quotations much more than I and 7 per cent to Investors There " ri , of course, exceptions that are well worth leaving alone, but the greater number of the .w industrial shares are selling many pom s Tder their intrinsic wortlx. Eventually this cla-s of issues wIU sell higher, and the predic tion is made that some of the more attractive iies il'. make records that will distance the best railroad stocks by many points. Standard Oil General Electric. Pullman and linger be* £g Machin. shares are c-xamples of industria stocks' possibilities. Many industrial issues not dealt in on the Stock Exchange are poor prop osTtions for Investors. On the *&2*g£Z£l there are only a few industrial securities that Ire not worth more than their quoted figur^ There are bad railroad shares, however, and bad industrial shares.

Current trade Is of ample dimensions, but traffic congestion grows worse, and labor controversies add to the embarrassment of shippers, if consignments of fane} goods for the holiday trade are delayed much longer there will be serious loss.

Ex changes through the New- York Clearing House for the week exceeded those of a year ago by 7.7 per cent and 1899 by 31.3 per cent, while at other lead- Ing cities the gains were 12.2 and 17.3 pi r cent, re spectively. Railway earnings continue their steady advance, surpassing November, 1900. by lo.S per cent, and those of two years ago by 18 per cent. Although nominal quotations of iron and steel are unchanged, figures reff»r only to future deliveries, and in most cases prices for current shipment command a considerable premium. Since this mar gin is Influenced by local conditions at the various mills and furnaces, besides being further compli cated by scarcity of freight cars and strikes, it is almost impossible to arrive at a fairly representa tive price level. In general, however, the tone is distinctly firmer, with especial scarcity of billets and further importations. Steel rail mills are still accepting orders, with their capacity engaged about up to the end of next year, and there Is much concern regarding the filling: of contracts since the lack of fuel grows more alarming. In stead of pig iron production showing another new high record on December 1. as was Indicated by the urgency of demand, it now appears probable that a loss will be officially announced, because coke was not available. Instead of furnace stocks being en tirely eliminated, an increase may be recorded, sim-e cars could not be secured to remove supplies. although mills were urgtnt in requesting prompt shipment. Architects" plans point to a brisk move ment of structural material when work begins on projected undertakings, and merchant steel mills have under B for months ahead. A seasonable de crease has occurred in the movement of pipe, while independent mills have furnished sufficient competi tion in sheets and wire nails to bring slightly lower prices. The corner in tin collapsed, prices falling about eight cents in a few days, and silver declined to the lowest point since September, 1597. "Bradstreefs" says: This has been a notable week in trade and indus try. Retail distribution, stimulated by cold weath er and holiday influences, has been very large, and is reflected in" a decidedly good reasserting demand from Jobbers. Holiday trade, in fact, promises to he of unprecedented volume, with demand for a better class of goods. In the great industries, such as Iron, coal, lumber, the textiles. Jewelry, boots and shoes and the various kin ired and subsidiary branches, activity has been widespread. The de mand for Iron, at the highest prices of the year, except In wire and nails, has only been limited by the question of obtaining: supplies. In «neral spec ulation the features, of course, are the cominued advances in the cereals, provisions and raw cotton, movements fraught wit>i much interest to the asricultural part of the community. The Wfinw sustained prices for nine years have been .rea. ne.i in corn and oats, and wheat Is at the hlKhest for seventeen months, with the end of the movement apparently not yet. clearly in *i«?ht. The advance in cotton has already induced a more cheerful tone In Southern trade, and collections, and bLisiness, it is predicted, will shortly improve. Advices tto "Bradstreefs" are of snow in the drouth str l < l,®" Southwest and of winter wheat prospects being improved thereby. The rise in food staDl^» J *™ metals is the basis for the apparent resumption n the advance in the general level of prices noted in November. Monthly failures returns are not exces sive. and less than in any but the last two > ear. while liabilities compare very favorably with tne past. Cloarings .ire unprecedented for this time o. year, and the outlook favors a total for the hole country far in advance of the hundred billion mark. and. therefore, the best on record. Aliinaii. the feeling grows that 1901 has set new standards of measurement /or the future In nearly all lines. Ol
