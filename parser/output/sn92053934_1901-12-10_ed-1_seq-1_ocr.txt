Dr. A. I.eteve. of the C. I.. Mflgee pathological depart luent of Mercy hospital, has dls-overed what has every indication: of being a successful serum treatment for tetanus or lockjaw. After a year of patient experimenting on lower animals the doctor, within the last three weeks, had the opportunity of testing his the ory on human subjects, one a middle aged man. a middle-aged woman and a loy 10 years of age. According to the physician's state ment, when these patients were first given the injection of the serum they were violent. lelng in spasms and con vulsions. The treatment soon brought them around, and within tire or six days they were restored to their for mer health. Dr. Leteve does not claim that the treatment will, cure every case, but believes that the problem of treating tetanus successfully has been solved. HELLO GIRLS MAY HAVE TO GO Kaltlmore 31 an Invents a Dettoe for lls- posingof Her Services. Ernest A. Faller, an electrical and mechanical engineer of Baltimore. has invented and successfully oper ated an automatic telephone ex- hange. .Mr." Faller is "a native VTft he Black Forest in south Germany and is but 31 years old. Six years ago. while installing a telephone ex change in San Francisco he conceiv ed the idea u)Kn which his "mechan- cal operator" is built. lie secured financial backing, hid himself awav first at the viaduct plant, anil later at 705 East Fayette street in Baltimore, and in May last an exeriniental machine, rudely built, was given a trial, and every hope of the inventor was realized. Then followed the actual building of a lOO-'phone exchange equipment. Sweeping patent rights were secur ed, and the machine is now complete. Some of the merits of the mechan- cal oierator as compared with pres ent day manual and so-called auto matic exchanges, will be seen by the following: A multiple exchange of l.OOO circuits has 1.250 or mtire mag nets; the present automatic ex change of the same size has 3.0O0, while the Faller system only requires 154. and the proportion holds hrough all sizes of exchanges. A small multiple exchange of 1,000 subscribers with metallic circuits would have 10,000 talking contacts.' The present automatic of the same size would have 2,000,000 while this new mechanical operator would have only 3.0O0. The multiple exchange of ,0O) subscrilers woultl have 160.000 contacts; the present automatic 32, 000.000, which is wholly impractic able, while this new mechanical op erator would have only 12,000. The new system is flexible, with no "multiple" feature. The slmplic- ty of circuits is fully preserved. It works as fast as the multiple system now used. No calls can be lost as the result of n rush on any section. The apparatus is easy to operate and the necessary attachments can be placed on any equipment now in use in n short jieriod. It has "num ber wheels," which expose a number through a small opening, leaving n. means of check that the right num ber is set for the subscriber. It is set by a half turn of a knob. and the subscriber does not have to stand with his ear at the receiver, but can proceeil with other business until the bell announces that connec tion is made. From the moment the sender is set o the required number and the call ing knob turned until the end of the conversation the exchange operates automatically and independently at the subscriber, and it is impossible for him to interfere with it. Notice is given of the completed connection by the ringer, and, as in manual ex changes, the act of hanging tip the receiver restores all parts of the cir- uit to normal or postion of rest. It cannot be definitely learned whether the new company is nego tiating with the other companies. but it is believed that it is.

SENATORS 1'KOM SOUTH CAROLINA They Occupy the Floor and Mont of the Time of the Senate. Washington, Dec. lo. The senate chamber wa the scene of a highly dra- inane episode yesterday wbeu liilir.an of South Carolina challenged his -ol- league, Mcl.aurin to resign with him on the spot, in order, to use his own language, that they might bo able "to wash their dirty linen at home. Mc- Laurln did not take up the gauge. The incident was the direct sequel of the very bitter controversy which arose between the senators in South Caro lina last spring. McLaurin yesterday, Ieakiiig to a question of cr8onal privilege, complained that there was a conspiracy to discredit him as a Demo crat in his own state. Ixn-ause he did ot act with his party, out of which he declared he would not be driven. It develoxd 1n the course of the de bate that he was not in line with the Democracy as to the tariff, the Span- sh war. the Phlliplpne policy and the upbuilding of our merchant marine. He said that last spring, before the ad journment of the senate, the chairman of the Democratic national committee in the cloak room asked him why he no longer attended the Democratic caucuses. lie had replied that in view of his opinion of the questions growing out of the Spanish war he thought his presence might be embarrassing. The Democratic chairman had replied: Then iverhaix it would be less em barrassing to you not to be invited to the caucuses?" McLaurin said he had replied: "Certainly." In replying to Mcl.aurin Jones cf Arkansas said the cloak room Incident was this way. He (Jones) had been asked by the caucus Ulcer for the list of senators who were to bo summoned to a caucus, and McLaurin's name be ing mentioned lie (Jones) had said he himself would see the senator from South Carolina. ' "I met him In the loak room." said Jones, "and recalling the fact that he had not attended a Democratic caucus for more than two vears I asked him what his status was. lie replied that his relations with the party were such that he thought it would be embarrassing for him to en- er the Democratic caucus. I then said to him: 'Yon do not wish to b Invited then?" and he. replied: 'Cer- inly.' " Then Tillman took the floor and said that ' though his name had not been mentioned he knew he was the cause of It all. He then told the story of the quarrel from his standpoint; of the resignation or ootn or tne senators uiving been tendered to the governor, who had recommended that said reslg. nations be withdrawn; of the with drawal of McLaurin's. without quall- cation. and of the withdrawal of his own with the, qualification "if it can be withdrawn." He said he did not relieve the resignations could be with drawn, but that the matter could eas ily be settled. He wanted the Judici ary committee to look into the matter. as. h should enjoy, nothing so much UJJ CAPITAL DOINGS AT A GLANCE Washington, Dec. 10.

Hoar's contribution to the incident was the declaration that he doubted whether either gentleman from South Carolina was entitled to a seat, now; that probably their resignations wern trood at the instant oflered and could pot be withdrawn, as they ceased to 1 senators the moment they signed their resignations.

The com mittee took no final action, adjourning for the day. After tlie meeting the members stated that while no conclu sions had !kcii reachi'd and no votes taken the discussions anil the hearing of Root hail practically determined that the Taft tariff rates of Nov. 15 would be applied against goods enter ing the Fhilipipnes, and the Dingley rates against -goods entering the I'nit ed States from the Philippines.

MACHINERY Cigarmakers at the Federation Convention Fail to Have It Condemned. THEIR FIGHT IS WELL PLANNED, But the Victory Is Willi the Qpposl tion Metu.1 Trades 1-Vdera, tion Organized. Scranton, Ta.t Dec. 10. The confer ence of the American Federation of Labor was in seslon only two hours yesterday, adjournment being taken until this morning in order to enable the several committees to consider the large number of resolutions still in their hands. There was a lively dis cussion on the floor over the question of boycott lug machine-made cigars. It ii the same question that the Cigar- makers' International Union has brought up at previous conventions of the Federation, and the union has al ways been defeated In its light against the introduction of machinery in the c'gar trade. At the present time not a machine-made cigar in the United States, it is said, bears the label of the Cigarmakers International Union. Argument of the Anii-Machine Men. The matter came up in the form of a resolution proscuted by Iresident tiompers and John C. Deerhell and Thomas F. Tracer, of the Cigarmak crs' Union, and -was referred to the vommittee on labels. It denounced a rertaln company for making cigars by child labor and machinery, and called upon the Federation to assist in union Izing the various plants of the com pany. J he committee reported the resolution back with the recommenda tion that the word "machinery" be stricken out and the resolution adopt ed. Then the cigarniakers opened their tight. They insisted that the term "machinery" should not be elim inated, and argued that' cigars made by machinery are not as good as those made by hand, and that the machines diive hand cigarniakers out of the business. Aineniled Iteoolntlon "fJetu There. The speakers in opposition to the cigarniakers" proposition argued that to oppose machinery would be folly. Ma chines are nemg introduced In manv Iies of trade, they said, aiid the union could not successfully light the law of progress. It was pointed out to the cigarniakers that the lest thing to do was to organize the operators cf the n aclnnes and adopt a wage scale, just us the ty'iographical and other unions have done when machinery was intro duced in their trades. The discussion promised to 1m very lengthy, but the moving of theprevious question ended the debate and the resolution, with the word "machinery" stricken out, was adopted as recommended.

Serious inter national complications may result from an encounter which took place yestetdav between the German troops and a company of Punjaub in fa n try, which is stationed here Three German privates were killed and die German officer was mortally wounded in the fight. On the Brit ish side three men were slain and several more wounded. The ae counts of the fray, which was short but decisive, differ somewhat, the Germans claiming that they acted from first to last in self-defense while the Indian troops aver that the Germans were aching for a chance of showing their hatred for the English. Hi' trouble was started by a sen try belonging to the Indian regi ment, who ran amuck and killed two of his comrades. The sentry, who is said to have been crazed by liquor, while quarreling with companions suddenly brandished two revolvers ind without- a word of warning shot at random into a crowd of unarmed soldiers who had tried to quiet him Two men were killed outright and others were slightly wounded. Th. sentrv then ran through the streets of the city, shouting and swearing. The people fled in terror right and left. A company of Pun jaub infantry was at once sent out to secure him. The sentrv later met i. company of German troops, whom he celled cowards and" brutes, saying that they deserved to be treated like the Boers in South Africa. He emptied his revolver in the regiment. wounding one German officer mor tally, lie was shot dead by the Germans. In the meantime the companj of Punjaub infantry arrived on the scene. A row ensued between the commanding officers and a free fight was precipitated. The battle last ed but a short time, the Punjaubs being put to flight, leaving their dead and injured on the street. Af terward the Germans took the wounded of both sides to their bar racks and cared for them. The ierman troops have been confined to heir barracks until further orders.

Don't forget that politeness is the foster sister of diplomacy and an essential tact. Don't appraise a book at anoth er s valuation. Critics are not cen sors absolute.
