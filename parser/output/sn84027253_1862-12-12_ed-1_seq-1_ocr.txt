A St. Louis correspondent of the Columbus Crisis writes as follows: "The man for whom Gen. McNeil shot ten some time ago, and which was noticed in the Crisis, has returned home alive and well, and bis wife, before the execution of those men, Went to him (General McNeil") and plead with him to wait and see if he had been killed be fore he executed those men, and the bruto spurned her. I can write no more. enion.—the ST. Lous." The story of the correspondent of the Cri tis is a lie out of whole cloth. It has already famished a theme for extravagant and abu sive comment from the Cincinnati Enquirer, Mid will doubtless go the rounds of the Democratic press of the whole North. There liill be no measure to the horror these papers Will exhibit at the atrocities of General McNeil. The well authenticated barbarisms of the rebel authorities, however, excite no revulsion in the feelings of these patriot ed itors. They have never said a word at the savage cruelties practiced upon the innocent Union men of East Tennessee. The horrible shooting of the drowning seamen in the waters of "White river, at the storming of Fort St. Charles, by order of the Confederate commander, is passed by without one tithe Of the condemnation they now visit upon the unavoidable severities of Union officers.— There is but one conclusion in view of this state of things, and that is, that the hearts of the majority of the Democratic editors of the North are altogether with the South. They •re a pack of villainous traitors, exaggerating the rigors of Federal rule, and manufacturing the grossest lies against the Government and its officers, for the purpose of dividing the sople of North in their attachment to the St. Louis Dem., 3d. The Courier of this city published the statement of the Crisis with a flourish of trumpets, and with the additional untruth that the men shot by order of Gen. McNeil were not charged with any crime, and were punished because of the absence of one man from the community. It perpetrated this unblushing falsehood even after publishing in its own columns the official notice condemning the ten men who were shot, charging them with having been members of Porter's guerrilla gang and with having vio lated their paroles of honor—some of them five or six times. Two of them were notori ous murderers. Yet the Courier and papers o£its kind expend a vast amount of sympathy Mr these men, and not a tear do they shed oter the cruel death and sufferings of Union men at the hands of the rebels. How consti tutional I how patriotic Expected Attack on Yickubnrg. Upon this last remaining Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi the rebels are firing their hopes and concentrating their forces. They have cut away all the timber on the Peninsula opposite the city, which ob structed the range of their guns. It was •dross the neck of this Peninsula that Gen. Williams attempted to cut a canal early last KBnmer, but did not succeed. The rebels lgjve since partially filled it up. .JThe attack upon Yicksburg will be made simultaneously by land and water. The fleet from below "and the gunboat flotilla from above will, it is expected, operate at once, while the united forces of Generals Grant, MfcClernand and Sherman will, at the same make the assault on the land side. iGen. Grant is pushing southward on the fee of the Central Mississippi railroad, and is towards of 100 miles north of Jackson, the Mfital of Mississippi, and the latter is about 30 miles eastward from Yicksburg. The force under McClernand will probably be carried down from Cairo and Memphis by wkrer transports. Grant's progress is neces •nily slow, as the rebels destroy the railroads ilhd bridges in their rear. Doubtless the rebels will bring all their Mailable forces to the defence of Yicksburg: £et the attack on the part of the Union forces will be so overwhelming as to leave hardly 997 doubt as to the result.

UNSUCCESSFUL EXPEDITION On the 15th of November, the 4th Iowa Infantry, along with eight or ten other regiments, started on an expedition from Helena. The troops were under command of (Jen. Hovey. The fleet consisted of 14 transports and the gunboat Carondelet. They moved down the Missis aippi to the mouth of White river, 150 miles below Helena. The navigation of White liver was attempted, but the water was low to make any headway. As a consequence tiie enterprise was abandoned, and the little •rmy returned to Helena. 9*It seems to be accepted as settled that Secretary Smith takes the vacant Indiana Judgeship in January, and the rumors re garding his successor point most strongly to Judge Holt of Kentucky.

The tenor of the Cow ier's editorials for the past six weeks indicate that it is opposed to the further prosecution of the war. It made strong professions before the election of being in favor of putting the rebellion down by vigorous measures. What its object was then we will leave it to explain. It still pro fesses to be in favor of a restoration of the Union, Now will it tell us how the Union can be restored by any other means than by subduing the rebels? If we must treat them as still under the regis of the Constitution how can we subdue them If we allow them the privileges granted by the Constitu tion, each one must be caught and tried by a jury of his countrymen before ho can be con victed and punished for his treason. Is this practicable Of course not. How foolish, then, it is to talk of restoring the Union by any means which recognizes rebels as entitled to the privileges of the Constitution. The Courier has repeatedly denounced the President's proclamation as unconstitutional. The proclamation proposes simply to take from the rebel his slaves and free them, if the rebel does not cease his rebellion. While the Courier was talking so valiantly about putting down the rebellion by force of arms, it never hinted at a plan to do so without ta king the rebel's life, and yet his life is cer tainly more precious than his nigger. Will the Courier tell us why it is unconstitutional to take the former and not unconstitutional to take the latter Southern View of the Conserva tive Victory, The radical manipulation of the President and his policy have never ceased to shout that the triumph of conservative principles in the elections at the North would afford great aid and comfort to the rebels at the South. Stupid as was the assertion, it may doubtless have had its weight with the thoughtless and ig norant and we have no reason to suppose that the shouters themselves are not fully capable of believing what they shouted.— New York World of Wednesday. A fitting comment on this paragraph is the following extracts from the New Orleans cor respondent of the New York Herald, under date of November 15th The National A dvocite, Jacob Barter's paper, has been suppressed. The reason why is contained in the following order: 

SPECIAL ORDERS—NO. 513. HBADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF GCI», New Orleans, Nov. 14. The Daily Advocate having, after wani ng, published the following: THE BALLOT BOX.—This palladium of our liberties, this charter of our rights, this em blem of democracy, has been speaking in a voice of thunder as we knew it would if the people could be aroused from their slumber. It has been our unceasing endeavor to awake them throughout the nation. We were the first to tell our readers of its successes in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana, and now we have gratifying reports from Illinois, New Jersey and New York. If these reports be confirmed, an armistice will soon follow. Ne gotiations once commenced, there will not be any more fighting. Whether an armistice results from the Democratic auccess, or from foreign intervention, we shall hail it as a peace measure to be welcomed by all parties." The publication of that journal will be dis continued from this dale. By command of Maj. Gen. Butler. GEO. C. STRONG, Acting Adjutant General. "Bully" for old Ben. Butler! 'A Federal supply train of forty-seven wagons was attacked by several hundred mounted guerrillas in Texas County, Mo., about thirty miles south of Lebanon, on the 24th ult. The train was escorted by fifty men of the third Missouri Cavalry. They made a vigorous resistance, had five of their number killed, and about a dozen wounded, and inflicted an equal if not a greater loss upon the enemy. The latter succeeded in capturing twenty of the wagons. Ths rest were brought off in safety, with their con tents, by the escort and the teamsters. The guerrillas were pursued by the 23d Missouri regiment and completely routed at Houston. It is stated, on what is said to be good authority, that not less than one hundred and eighty thousand of the soldiers whose names now fill the muster-rolls are absent, with or without leave. Who is responsible for this astounding fact? and cannot.$pai£ punishment reach the guilty n •. (E?" Suppose the Democratic peace compro mise schemes fail, will the leaders of that fac tion be willing to fight it out on real war principles, or will they advocate letting the South go There is great want of informa tion on this point. The Only Path to Peace. [From the Washington Dally Chronicle—Forney's new paper.] At last all sides seem to agree that the only path to peace is through the bloody waste of war. The strongest alone can succeed. It is not diplomacy, but strength and the sword, which can adjust this stupendous problem. The European nations, England chiefly, now see this thing as we present it. The rebels boldly refuse to accept any other umpire but that offered by the victor on the battle field, and the loyal people of the United States hav ing so much to lose, and having offended the seceders and traitors so little—indeed in no one wrong that can ever be respectably charged, not to say decently proved—these same loyal people will never consent to com promise or barter away any one of the fran chises, great or small, which attach to a Gov ernment based upon the popular voice, and for nearly eighty years the source of unend ing blessings to all the hunted races of men. There is therefore a sort of unanimity on this question among those directly interested.— The seceding and adhering States desire peace, and finally see there is only one way to achieve it. It is true that the aggressive party would gladly consent to adjustment on the basis of a recognition of their treason—a condition which is indignantly rejected by the other and unoffending party, which, in tum, offers as its preliminary to peace, sub mission to the Federal authority. Rather than this, say the leaders of the rebellion, come pestilence and famine and the thirsty sword. The day for describing the horrors of disunion has passed. They are felt by all men in the horrors of secession, and we fight against the first because we know they must be more fearftil than the last. If, whether through the forcible remedy of Fernando Wood or John Van Buren, or if the next Presidential election came off to-morrow in stead of two years hence, Abraham Lincoln should be superceded in the Presidency, the new Federal Executive would' be compelled to wage this war for the restoration of the Union and the the punishment of the rebel lion with resistless determination to the bitter end. So that the path to peace and to a res toration of the Union is either through the bloody waste of war, or by mens of that submission to the Federal Government which must result when the sonthem people an convinced that the President is determined to ptqMpqfe 'it iwpoinpiwnifeiiigjlp to the dose.

LONDON, Conn., Nov. 27, 1862, DEAR JOURNAL This has been New England's festive day. Governor's proclama tions have made desolate many a family of barn-yard fowls. The traditions and customs of the Pilgrim Fathers seem to be treasured in everlasting and grateful remembrance by the people of New England. They may retain some Puritanical notions relating to morals, but they have a true idea of what turkeys and pumpkins are, by a mysterious Providence, designed for. I like the Puritanical observance of Thanks giving Day. A Governor's proclamation has some vitality—something of life—when it is deemed of sufficient importance to be read from every pulpit in the Commonwealth on the Sabbath. There is also in the custom an exhibition of respect, at least, for the Execu tive of the State and all the people praise him, without regard to political opinions. The bells have sent out their merry peals, and, in response, the people have assembled in their several sanctuaries, to return thanks for the favors of the past year, and to be especially thankful that matters are no worse than they are. I suppose there were some sermons delivered, to-day, not exactly in accordance with the Tory spirit of the day. Some may have left their pews, thereby symbolizing the banishment of the wicked. By all means, commend mc to a New England Thanksgiv ing especially the dinner part, to which, I humbly trust, I have just done ample justice. The Legislature of this State convenes in extra session, Dec. 9th, to consider some im portant financial questions. If this should perchance meet the eye of any member of that body, I would urge him, by every considera tion, to extend the right of suffrage to the loyal men of the State who are absent, strug gling on distant fields to protect that right for others. With the soldiers' vote, Connecticut will send a Union delegation to the next Con gress, and elect the Union ticket throughout. Without it, the Tories of the Tom Seymour stripe will secure two, if not more, members of Congress, and not unlikely carry the State. The party in power owe it to the country to do just what a Tory Democracy would do had it the power, and it would be benefited thereby. The Republican Union Party ought not to suffer the enemies of the Government and of the Administration to triumph when they can be defeated by the votes of the tru est patriots which the land can boast. Those miserable semi-traitors, Van Buren, Seymour and the Woods, carried New York simply because the Union party in power failed to allow her soldiers to vote. Let Connecticut profit by the lesson taught in New York, Iowa and Missouri. I said above that Seymour carried New York by which I wished to be understood the city. The entire State vote gives Seymour 10,500 majority. The city gives him 31,000 majority showing a majority against Sey mour, outside of the city, of 20,000. I will also say that, of Mr. Seymour's 10,500 ma jority, 10,981 votes were cast in such localities as Corlan's Hook, Five Points, Mackerelville, &c.—very complimentary to the Tory party! St. Lawrence county (containing 29 towns, every one of which gave a Union majority,) gave in the aggregate a Union majority of over 9,000. Truly, God made the country! Seymour's majority, then, comes from the localities above named, with a small margin. I attribute this to the practical Free-Loveism of Mr. Van Buren. I have been very much amused on reading an editorial in Harper's Weekly, of Nov. 22d, on the Recent Elections." It contains this very extraordinary passage We are inclined to think that if the army had voted—as did the soldiers of Iowa, Mis souri and other States the Democratic ma jority in New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Ind iana and Illinois would rather have been increased than diminished." With the returns from the several States before him, I must confess that, to my mind, the foregoing paragraph is as clear as mud. Had the soldiers of New York voted, the majority for Seymour and the Woods would have been increased, because the soldiers of Missouri saved that State to the glorious work of Emancipation because three-fourths of "Kirkwood's Pets"—or the soldiers of the Republic from Iowa voted the Republican ticket, therefore, Vallandigham would have been elected from Ohio, had her soldiers been allowed to vote It may be good logic, but I don't see the pint! By the-way, what a commentary is the result of the Missouri election upon that great revolution in the political sentiments of New York, Ohio, &c. New York and Ohio strike for Slavery and Treason—Missouri for Freedom and Loyalty. Thus will it ever be —Slavery synonymous with Treachery and Disloyalty. He who loves Slavery more than Liberty, can be true neither to his God, his countiy, or his fellow-men. 3 3 BY JOHN MAHIN. MUSCATINE, IOWA, FRIDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1862. but it was that high sense of honor, known among thieves, of taking without compensa tion, as common in the South. Had the South been true to its obligations, every mill, factory and ship yard in the East, would now be in successful operation. The removal of McClellan has effected one good, to wit: the conversion of his friends and admirers to an energetic and vigorous war policy. Weeks ago they were defenders of McClellan's cautious, slow and easy poli cy, having a thousand and one excuses for his failures. To-day they are complaining and grumbling because Burnside don't move fast enough and display more energy. As Burnside grows in the love and admiration of his soldiers, they assert "he ought to have seized upon Fredericksburg immediately up on the arrival of his advance at Falmouth There are others who endeavor to console themselves with the delusion that Burnside is acting upon McClellan's plans—and that when the former achieves a victory he will give to the latter all the honor. But they do not seem willing to throw the responsibility and blame «f ia They Soon after the election of Mr. Lincoln, and about the time of his induction to office, it will be recollected there were frequent news paper reports of heavy failures among the manufacturers of the East, and that thereupon the Democracy sent up a howl half pitious, half defiant, "there, did'nt we tell you so— you've elected your Black Republican Presi dent, and thrown your factory and mill ope rators and mechanics out of employment.— The business men and capitalists of the East have no confidence in your President, and the country is on the verge of ruin." In the North part of this city, stands two large manufacturing establishments, devoted to building steam engines, boilers, cotton-gins, 4c., 4c., formerly giving employment to probably 300 hands. Both now stands idle —or very nearly so—both would be in full and successful operation, had the proprietors the cash, for certain paper held against parties now actively engaged in sustaining the rebel lion. One of these establishments tared cotton-gins to a very great extent In the fall of I860 they sent their notes South for annual collections. Instead of money came fresh orders. The proprietora thought it all right. A greater pressure of steam was put on—more hands employed, and all went "merry as a marriage beH." The new contracts were filled—notes sept South, jind there came back for answer—Repudiation. The firm (ailed for $80,000—all in the hands of the chivalric Democracy—"our wayward sisters" and misguided brethren of the South. It Was not the election of Mr. Lincoln that threw so many thousands out of employment-* Burnside failure upon Mc­ Clellan. Well, I knoW how they feel, for I felt exactly so when Fremont was removed after a three months probation. But then I sup pose there must be strategy in plans, which take fourteen months, to prove worthlss and insufficient to achieve a victory.— McClellan must be the next Presi dent. Why Because his speech es of Newark, New York, &c., demonstrate his statesmanship: "Fellow citizens, I am too modest for ut terance over this distinguished and unantici pated honor. I am happy to see you. I led tho soldiers, brave and courageous, from Manassas through the Chickohominy swamps and back to Antietam. I think much of those soldiers. I think much of you. I thank you for your presence. I can say no more." Has any one read or seen a word uttered by Geo. B. McClellan, of encouragement or hope of counsel or advice to the friends of the Union. Not a solitary, manly, patriotic sentiment worthy of an American soldier and statesman has he deigned to utter. Also! Napoleon—Cincinnattus, the chief who sold himself for a mess of pottage to Tory Brokers how has he disappointed the hopes of his most sanguine friends. Tell me,

"The last advices from New Orleans brought a statement that seven of the Na tional soldiers who had been taken prison ers of war by tha rebels, were shot by them for treason to th5 South, because they were enlisted at New Orleans. The Democratic journals which have expended so 'much hor ror on the execution of ten rebels in Missouri have not even noticed this case. Yet, to a mind unbiased by rank disloyalty, the other would seem a light affair compared with this, in which, to the atrocity of shooting seven prisoners of war, in cold blood, is added the monstrous rule that all loyal Southern men who enlist in the National armies shall be shot when captured. How can savageness in warfare go beyond this and the just retali atian for it?

The following las been received at head quarters: HEADQUARTERS, IN TNE F(EIP,F Near Abbeyville, Dec. 3. To ««!ry W. Halleck, General-in Chief.• The enemy deserted his fortifications yes terday, destroying all the stores they could not carry with them. The weather is bad and the streams swollen, making it difficult to cross. Some of our cavalry swam the river, however, and occupied the place last night. To-day pursuit was made to Oxford, and coming on the rear guard of the enemy, skirmishing took place, lasting about two hours and resulting in the capture of about sixty rebels. The pursuit will be continued to-morrow, but the roads are too impassable to get much supplies for a larger continuance of if. Gen. Sherman is crossing at Wyatt. (Signed) U. S. GRANT. FT. MONROE, Dec. 3. We learn by those who have had an oppor tunity of seeing for themselves that Peters burg, and all along the route between there and Richmond, is being fortified by digging rifle pits and throwing up strong earthworks, and large forccs are at work upon them, day and night. The channel through the stone blockade at Charleston is temporarily obstructed by rail road iron, so that the rebels can easily remove it for their own use. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Capt. Jno. L. Ellwood, formerly Quarter master U. S. A., who has been confined for three months in the Old Capital Prison, com mitted suicide Wednesday. He was formally elected Colonel of a New York regiment, but was arrested on unknown charges by order of the Secretary before he assumed command. The Court Martial of Fitz John Porter was in session to-day. Gen. Pope being under an examination the substance of his testimony is that if Porter had obeyed his order prompt ly he could have entirely defeated, if not cap tured, Jackson's army. Senator Wilson, of Minn., to-day presented an earnest but protest to the President against the pardon or reprieve of condemned Indians in that State. After reading this pa per to the President, Messrs. Windom and Aldrich being present, and heartily endorsing the project, decided to join therein, with Sena tor Wilkinson, thus making the action of the entire Republican delegation in Congress from that State unanimous. 

NEWUFRN, N. C., via Ft. Monroe, Dec. 3. Late Raleigh papers indicate a strong feel ing of disgust with this bloody war, and a growing and prevalent desire for honorable peace. The village of Greenville, on the Tar River, has been taken possession of by our forces. NEW YORK, Dec. 5. Tho New York subscription in aid of Eng lish operatives, received $40,000, including $10,000 from A. L. Stewart. PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 4. The Washington Star of this evening has the following from Fairfax Station, Wednes day afternoon: There is no news from our front. A man has arrived within our lines from New Or leans with a pass from Gen. Butler. He came bv way of Richmond and Gordonsville to Madison Court House, and says that a part of Jackson's forces were at the latter place a week ago and went thence to Liberty Mills, where they encamped. The Star contains the particulars of the suicide of Capt. John Ellwood, of the regular army. It says the affair was truly deplora ble, and calls for a thorough investigation, the deceased having been confined in prison for an offence entirely unconnected with the public enemy or prosecutors ofthe war. Special to New York Timet. NEW YORK, Dec. 8. The Tribune has the following from Wash ington/ A, citizen of Baltimore was recently taken by rebel pickets near Centreville and for warded to Richmond. He has since stated that he went within their reach for the ex press purpose of being captured. While in Richmond, where he has numerous acquaint ances, he had frequent intercourse with mem bers of the Confederate Cabinet, and was ad mitted into many secrets of the programme. When the time arrived for his departure North he was sent for by J. P. Benjamin, who handed to him letters addressed to Governor Seymour, Fernando and Ben. Wood, of New York, Vallandighrfn and Cox, of Ohio, Bay ard, of Delaware, Reverdy Johnson, of Mary land, and a number of other noted Democratic leaders in the North and in the Border States. In the verbal instructions given to Barney no terms were asked for. Southerners told him they would consent to no terms that if not admitted into the Union again as equals they would not come in at all. What they ask is the granting of an amnesty to all the military and civil leaders of the rebellion so that an election for members of Congres can be made during the coming winter, and that body be called together at least as early as April. Sigel to-day demanded a Court of inquiry to investigate charges and imputations of Pope's letter to Halleck. Tribune has the following: Situation un changed. The pickets for five miles above and along the river are very friendly. Yester day three of the enemy's pickets, belonging to an old regiment, came across the river and talked for an hour with ours. They endeav ored to trade for coffee and overcoats. Two other rebel soldiers forded in sight of their pickets and gave themselves up as deserters They were sent to Burnside's Headquarters. Rebel force across the river supposed to be about 80,000. WASHINGTON, Dec. 5. In the McDowell Court of Inquiry, the de fense offered the testimony of Col. Ruggels to remember that it does not rest with human prove the witness examined yesterday was a power to prevent the disturbing influences of man of ability without good reputation, hav war, and the gp&ulfttioD yhjch it engenders, ing been detected in attempting fraud against -WMM Mtrm.

Heintzelman now testified to the total abstinence of Gen. McDowell from the use of wines and liquors, and directly contra ry to the evidence of the previous witness. In the Porter Court Martial, Gen. Pope was cross examined u long time by the Coun sel for the defendant. Among the questions asked him, was, why he had expressed to Gen. Porter, t« o days after his alleged diso bedience of orders, his determinotion not to report him for delay to take any action look ing to his impeachment. To this question Pope answered he did not think Gen. Porter deliberately withheld his troops from hiiu, but that this idea probably originated in a mistake or blunder. NEW YOIIK, Dec. 6. The Tribune's Washington dispatch says the statement in Barney's letter, printed in to-days's Tribune, that Barney had an inter vies with President Lincoln, is contradicted on the highest authority. It is further to be stated, upon the same authority, that the President has no knowledge whatever of the statements connected with that letter, and no communication on that subject, or embody ing any such information, had been made to him in any way. Leading Republicans have no knowledge of the matter, and the suppo sition that this letter has any weight from their alleged attention to Barney's statements is entirely erroneous. Tt may be added that no recent communi cation from Fernando Wood has been received by the President, and none whatever on these or similar subjects. Private advices from one of the most emi nent friends of America, in France, repre sents that the recent offer of mediation made by Napoleon is there regarded as the expres sion of a deliberate and matured purpose from which (he Emperor will not recede, and that it is considered a serious blo-.v to cur cause in Europe, and to the cause of freedom in Eu rope not less than to America. The following is from the Herald 

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF Potaue, December 5. Recent reconnoissances have discovered that no attempt is made by the enemy to hold that section north of the Rappahannock, their forces having entirely evacuated the country with the exception of small scouting parties. These'cross the river at small blinge ferries, now easily, in consequence of low water A dash upon our outposts succeeded in es caping by some new route unknown to our pickets. The difficulties heretofore existing in the transmission of the mails between Washington and the headquarters of the Army Gen Hovey left Helena on the 27th of No vember, with about 20,000 men. He landed at Friars Point, on the Mississ'ppi side, twelve' miles below. From that point he inarched direct to Grenada, which is one hundred miles south of Memphis. The presence of so large a force in the heat of Mississippi caused roost intense con sternation among the people. Large num bers fled in terror. The peop'e of Grenada heard of the approach of the Federal army, and for several days there was great commotion.— Hundreds left town, accelerated in their flight by the extreme Inste with which the Appeal proprietors packed up and made off—it is supposed to Marietta, Ga., where a paper mill is said lo be in operation. Gen. Hovey reached Grenada ou Monday evening. The few Confederate soldiers at Grenada left at his approach. They id planted four cannon on the highest hill, near the town, but they pointed north and could not be used in the opposite direction. Before leaving the Rebels burned about 100 cars, and between 15 and 20 locomotives, to gether with all their ammunition and army stores. WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. The fol'.owing has been received at head quarters CHARLESTON, NOV. 28. To Uaj. N. H. Uelwn, A. A. G.: Col. Paxton, with the 2d Virginia cavalry, supported by the 11th Ohio infantry, made The an attack on a post of the enemy near Cold Knob, GreenBriar county, on the 26th inst. It was a successful surprise, and our forces captured 2 commissioned officers, 100 non commissioned officers and privates, about 100 horses, 200 stand of arms, 4 wagons and the camp equippage of one regiment. The equip page and part of the arms were destroyed by Col. Paxton. No loss on our si|de. On the day before a small scouting party of the 8th Virginia had a skirmish with the enemy's cavalry in Logan county. Our men were outnumbered and forced to retreat, but without serious loss. (Signed) J. D. Cox, Maj. Gen. Wednesday morning last the Dragon, Capt. Wright, en route to Vort Royal, broke her engine and was forced to remain some hours near fowler's Rocks, about 25 miles up the river. A party of rebels, probably thinking she was not armed, put off from the south side of the river in five or six boats. There were fifty men in the boats. They made to wards the Dragon, but before they had ap proached too near, Capt. Wright let fly a shell, which exploded in one of the boats, and thej' hastily pushed to the shore. With a glass our officers saw the men were dressed in different uniforms, and probably were a guer rilla band. The Dragon was towed down by the Satel lite and this morning brought to the Wash ington Navy Yard by the Resolute. NEW YORK, Dec. 6. The steamer Ocean Queen, from Aspin wall, 25th, has arrived. There had been a tremendous gale at Aspinwall, lasting 3 days, during which the British brig Bolivar and the steamer Avon were wrecked. No lives lost. The steamer Ocean Queen lost her paddle box, but succeeded in getting to sea. The U. S. Brig Bainbridge was abandoned by her officers and crew, after throwing over board her guns and stores. All communication between Panama and Aspinwall was suspended. The wire was broke down and the railroad under water but was expected to be in running order by the 26th, as the water was subsiding. Nothing new from Central America. The ship George Washington was overhaul ed to day, while attempting to go to sea, by the U. S. Marshal. It is alleged that she has contraband goods aboard. It is rumored that several French vessels have' been adzed by the Government, but it is untrue. The Custom House was given up to-day and all mercantile business will now be transj acted in the old Exchange building. At a meeting at the Corn Exchange to day, there waa subscribed ever 0 *•& 'm. JJ-SU of the Po­ tomac have, through the energy of Headquar ters Postmasters Hastell and Coolev, at last been overcome, and letters are now received without delay. Convalescents and exchanged prisoners are flocking to their respective commands in great numbers. Gen. Burnside's order recommending the dismissal of officers guilty of neglect of duty in allowing their commands to be surprised by the enemy gives universal satisfaction, and will undoubted check the serious evils of care lessness on the part of commanders of out posts.

Viele, as Military Gov ernor, will issue his proclamation and writ of election for members of Congress from Nor folk District. A large vote will be polled, as residents here are anxious to save their slave property from the effects of the President's proclamation by conforming to its require ments. It is known that Hon. James Segar has succeeded in having his district exempted by the President from the effects of his proclam-. ation. WnEELiNfi, Va., Dec. C. The State Senate, to-day, passed a preaui-. ble and resolution setting forth that Mr. Car lisle had violated the instructions of the body that elected him in failing to sustain the legit imate efforts of the Government to suppress the rebellion, in opposing by his votes and speeches, in and out of the United States Senate, measures absolutely necessary to the preservation of the Union and the enforce ment of the laws, and in opposing the admis sion of the new State of Western Virginia into the Union, and requesting him to resign his seat. The resolution will come up in the House Monday, and probably pass by a large major* ity. In the House, to -day, a resolution passed re questing that body to pass the U. S. State bill now pending before it without alteration or amendment. It will come up Monday, and pass by nearly a unanimous vote. Gov. Pierpont's message endorses ti$£ emancipation policy of President Lincoln^ 

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF POTOMAC,^ December, 7. Last night was intensely cold, and some of the troops suffered for want of blankets. Ice formed in the Potomac and Acquia Creek from one to two inches thick. To-day the sun came out fair and cheering, but the air continued piercingly cold. The roads are hard and very rough. y The direction in which the rebels fled is not yet known. Federal cavalry were in pursuit. At last accounts from Gen. Grant he was pushing forward, and it is highly probable he is already at Grenada with his entire force.— If Admiral Porter intends to help open the Mississippi he will have to be in a hurry. It is said he leaves to-day for below. Officers state that Jackson has arrived in the vicinity of Fredericksburg and joined his forces with those already there. They also report that the enemy has extend ed his lines several miles further down the Rappahannock. The report that Major Spaulding is under arrest for unnecessary delay in the transport ation of the pontoon trains is unfounded.— That officer has been commended by his supe riors for overcoming weighty obstacles ia4bn execution of his orders. There have been no field movements, to-, day. Report of I lie War. Secretary ef Secretary Stanton's report is of great length—longer even than the President's Message. The Secretary states that the scene af war like operations comprises ten military depart ments, and that "the armies operating in those departments, according to recent offi cial returns, constitute a force of 775,330 officers and privates, fully armed and equip ped. Since the date of returns this number ha3 been increased to over SCO,000. When the quotas are filled up it will number a mil lion of men, and the estimates for next year are based upon that number.** He then proceeds to give a review of ths campaigns of the armies in the different de partments, and states that if these cam paigns have not equalled in their results the expectations of the Government and the pub lic hope, still they have not been unpro ductive of good results."—Chicago Journal.
