Colombia is now claiming the whole credit of suppressing her revolution. It would serve her right if next time, Uncle Sam should permit the Rebels to lick her to a standstill. The man who wishes to know why he fails to get an office at the hands ut the administration, probably will be ac commodated in the same way that Gov ernor Jenkins of Oklahoma was. The Sunday school Santa Claus does not have a continuous season like the woman who lights the fire with coal oil, but he keeps things lively in the conflagration line while he is at It.

Everybody who has anything to sell is offering it to Uncle Sam, probably because he has more money than any body else and is doing so much busi ness. A deal has just been closed with Denmark for her islands in the West Indies and now comes France with an offer to sell her uncompleted ditch across the isthmus. Texas has demonstrated the fact that an anti-trust law can be made to work if only the legislative and executive departments of the government are in earnest about it.

STAN LEY T0SH 0 P IV1 EN. Talks About the Yalne of the Man. Gov. W. E. Stanley filled his broken engagement with the Santa Fe shop men, speaking to them for 20 minutes at noon today at the coach shop. "I was Just wondering," he began, "a I came down through the round house at the immense locomotives which they are building now. An out sider can hardly fully comprehend what a wonderful development there has been in this. But we must remember that behind it all was human genius. It took skill to take that iron out of the moun tains and mold and shape it and put that steel there. "Another thing, here is a man in one shop working at a machine, and there another in another shop, and the whoie working to an intelligent purpose are able to send out a complete train of cars. It is an age of not seeing what position a man holds but what he is and does. There is no distinction be tween the man of high and that of low ' degree. Nineteen hundred years ago a man came into this world and illustrat ed that by the parable of the Good Samaritan. "One thing I want to Impress upon you above all else is the value of a man. What a great farce life would be if the only object of it were to get rich. What a failure it would be if It were only to get position. But it isn't that, it is the idea of being a man. And you e laboring men have an opportunity to be men without any hypocrisy in your work. Labor Is honest; and the only honest thing In life. That's the great est thing there is. "I congratulate you on what a power you are. Tou have, every man of you, the power of following his own judg ment. Let it direct you as fathers, neighbors, husbands and citizens. Learn to be independent citizens. That is what the state wants; honest men who will do their duty as they see it. Behind all the inventions of the age is man himself. And I pray that you men may be a power to exalt and dignify manhood." Four hundred and seventy-five shop employes listened to the address. Snowing in Kansas. Kansas City, Dec. 3.

Manager Foster Has 1902 Dates Practically Complete. KO COACH SELECTED Many Applications Hare Been Filed However. Association Has $2,000 For Start in Treasury. Lawrence, Kan., Dec. 3. 'Manager Foster of the Kansas university foot ball team is losing no time in perfect ing his schedule for the season of 1902. Nearly every date has been filled al ready and the whole schedule is practi cally completed. On the home grounds Nebraska, the Kansas State normal and Washburn college will play the Jayhawkers, while the northern trip with Wisconsin and Beloit of the paxt season will be repeated, with the proba- ble addition of Chicago. The season will be ended by the usual Thanksgiv ing game against Missouri at Kansas City. Foster says the '02 team promises to be one of the strongest aggregations in K. U.'s history. Nearly every man on this year's eleven will return and by their experience ought to make valu able men. while several old men will again enter the university next fall. With Nofsinger as captain, the Jay hawkers are confident of regaining their old football fame. Nofsinger is still confined to his bed, but slowly improv ing. No definite contract has been made for a coach, although many applica- tions have been filed. Manager Foster yesterday settled all his accounts and finds the Athletic association with near ly $2,000 In the treasury for the season just ended. The total income was about $7,000, and expenditures $5,000. Of the sum left $800 will be applied to square back accounts and the balance banked for next season's team. At the next meeting of the faculty council of Kansas university Professor W. N. Carruth will introduce steps looking to the eradication of the fea tures of football which seem to him especially injurious to the college and to the students. The measure will prob ably be in the shape of a resolution prohibiting the university team from playing any games except on the local gridiron. The students and many of the faculty of Kansas university are firm believers in the great college game and Professor Carruth's resolution will meet with a very spirited opposition. In some re cent chapel talks Professor Carruth aired his sentiments concerning foot ball and at a mass meeting the next week Clyde Allphin, one of the players was called upon to make a reply to the professor's speech. Allphin was cheered to the echo while the students who lis tened to Professor Carruth's talk did not give him a hand. SHARKEY AND MAHER To Meet For a Bout at Nutmeg Ath letic Club. New Tork, Dec. 3. Tom Sharkey and Peter Maher have practically been matched to meet in a limited round bout before the Nutmeg Athletic club, at Hartford, Conn., where Terry Mc- Govern and Toung Corbett fought on Thursday. Matchmaker William Crow ley has been negotiating with the men for the past two weeks and he expects to have them sign articles within a FEW PEOPLE REALIZE The Danger in That Common Disease, Catarrh. Because, catarrhal diseases are so common and because catarrh is not rapidly fatal, people too often overlook and neglect it until some incurable ail men develops as a result of the neglect. The inflamed condition of the mem brane of the nose and throat makes a fertile soil for the germs of Pneumonia and Consumption, in fact catarrhal pneumonia and catarrhal consumption are the most common forms of these dreaded diseases which annually, cause more than one quarter of the deaths in this country. Remedies for catarrh are almost as numerous as catarrh sufferers but very few have any actual merit as a cure. the only good derived being simply a temporary relief. There is, however, a very effective remedy recently discovered which is rapidly becoming famous for Its great value in relieving and permanently cur ing all forms of catarrhal diseases. whether located in the head, throat. lungs or stomach. This new catarrh cure Is principally composed of a gum derived from the Eucolyptus tree, and this gum possesses extraordinary healing and antiseptic properties. It is taken internally in the form of a lozenge or tablet, pleasant to the taste and so harmless that little children take them with safety and benefit. Eucolyptus oil and the bark are some times used but are not so convenient nor so palatable as the gum. Undoubtedly the best quality Is round in Stuart's Catarrh T.ablets which may be found in any drug store and any catarrh sufferer who has tried douches, nhalers and liquid medicines, will be surprised at the rapid Imorovement after a few days use or Stuart s Ca tarrh Tablets which are composed of the gum of the Eucolyptus tree, com bined with other antiseptics which de stroy the germs of catarrh in the blood and expel the catarrhal poison from the system. Dr. Ramsdell In speaking of Catarrn and its cure says: "After many exper iments I have given up the idea of cur ing catarrh by the use of inhalers, washes, salves, or liquid medicines. I have always had the best results from Stuart's Catarrh Tablets; the red gum and other valuable antiseptics contain ed in these tablets make them, in my opinion, far superior to any of the numerous catarrh remedies so exten sively advertised. The fact that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are sold in drug stores, under protec tion of a trademark, should not preju- ice conscientious physicians against them because their undoubted merit and harmless character make them a rem- dy which every catarrh sufferer may use with perfect safety and the pros pect of a permanent cure. i For colds in the head, for cougns, ca- tarhal deafness and catarrh of the stomach and liver, people who have tried them say that Stuart's Catarrh Tablets are a household necessity.

In all cases of broken-down constitu tions, shattered nerves and impover ished blood this remedy from the Green Mountains speedily cures.

KNOCKDOWN AFFAIR. Lively Battle at a School Near Cherryraie. Case Will Come Up In Court For Settlement. Independence, Kan., Dec. 3. Miss Anna Sharpless, a teacher in district 81, near Cherryvale, has made com plaint against Brudge Darling before Justice Way charging him with dis turbing the school. The history of the case is decidedly breezy. The Reporter ays of it: "It appears from the evidence that has come to hand that a family by the name of Darling has been a disturbing element in the" affairs of No. 81 for some time. Recently a son of Robert Darling known as "Brudge" was ex pelled from the school by Miss Sharp less for improper conduct. The action of the teacher was overruled by the board of directors and Brudge was al lowed to return to school. He is a big, strong youth about 18 years old and as big as the average man. The action of the board seemed to make the boy more arrogant than ever, and Tuesday Miss Sharpless had occasion to at tempt to apply the rod as a corrective and as an example of discipline for the benent of the school in general. Th manly (?) young fellow knocked Miss Sharpless down three times with his brawny fists and she has the marks on her features this minute that will show where the blows were struck. The children in the room became frightened ana rang the bell as an alarm. "Mr. S. K. Thomas, one of the dlrec tors, was plowing in a field near by and came hurriedly to the school house to learn the trouble. He took in the situation and had Just succeeded in ejecting the young bully from the house, when the elder Darling appear ed on the scene. He was armed with an iron instrument of some kind, with which he struck Mr. Thomas, felling him to the ground and rendering him insensible. "Miss Sharpless is not a delicate little thing by any means, and she weighs 160 pounds, and she says that with her own hands she dragged the insensible director into the school house. He re mained in an unconscious condition for forty-five minutes. A neighbor then took him to his home. Miss Sharpless succeeded in restoring order in the school room and they proceeded with the regular work until closing time. She is very nervy and says she will teach that school if she has to be taken away a corpse." UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT Is tba Charge Made Against Attor neys in Morrison Trial. Kl Dorado, Kas., Dec. 3.
