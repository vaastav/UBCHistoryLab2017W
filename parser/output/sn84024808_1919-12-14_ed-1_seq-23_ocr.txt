Stock Mark®it AS SEEN BY Bonis & Eesurs Reported by H. B. I.ake & Co. New York, Dec. 13.—Considerable week end covering by the more timid shorts made Its appearance today and was re flected In the betterment In sales, re ports that president would probably sub mit message to congress on the railroad situation early next week and a dispatch from abroad intimating that allies will accept some of the senate reservations to the peace treaty were the prime fac tor« that increased the desire of shorts to retire committments. Bank statement of today makes a rather unfavorable showing and In view of the year dis bursements, It seems reasonable to assume that there will be no easing in the money quarter for sometime, this combined with extremely unfavorable foreign exchange situation should curb any efforts at present time to advance stock. We think the better part of wisdom to take ad vantage of any upturns that may be re corded to make sales.—Logan & Bryan.

New York M&Aett financial. New York, Dec. 13.—Sentimental factors contributed to the better tone of today s stock market. a moderate rally in foreign : exchange, removal of coal restrictions and assurances of easier money in the coming week induced considerable short covering. There also was some buying for the long account. Tha strongest features of today s market, however, were the speculative Issues in the motor, oil, steel aJid equip ment divisions, with a liberal admixture of food, paper and miscellaneous special Extreme gains of 2 to 8V4 points in the many stocks which crumbled the day before were retained at the active finish, many leaders closing at maximum quotations. Rails played no part in the trading, that group showing further Ir regularity, except for Canadian Pacific, which made a net gain of 2% points, but recorded a loss of 7*4 points for the week. Sales amounted to 550,000 shares. Bonds followed the course of the stock market, standard industrial issues hard ening. Liberty and Victory bonds were inclined to ease with several of the international flotations. Total sales (par value) aggregated $12,875,000. Old United States bonds were unchanged on call during the week. a decrease of about $25,000,000 in actual reserves of the clearing house reduced the total excess to little more than $28,000,000 while actual loans were increased by almost $38,000,000.

Copy rieht, 1919. Merlin. Pec. Ii.— German railroad men have been convinced for some tim«' that the entente intends to eliminate their country from trans-European traffic. Germany's centra! position always has given it a tremendous advantage in this respect. Hut its experts say recent events show everything is being done to send the post-war routes around tier many both to the north and south. Cut Austria Out Too. "The map," a railway official said, "shows that a straight line runs from Lyon to the north Balkan and south Slav countries across northern Italy. Such a line since Triest has become Italian crosses no Aystrian territory. The ex isting French and Italian lines cun be extended i-a.st over Triest aud A gram to Belgrade and Bucharest and Odessa as well as to Athens and Constantinople. The French want to connect this up with a line from Geneva to Paris on one side and from I.you to Bordeaux on the other, thereby drawing travel not only away from the German porta, but the llolland ports as well. "But efforts certainly will be made to restore the old route of the < Irient ex press. The line Paris-Strassburg-Vien na-Bucharest is shorter than the one Paris-Milan-Bucharest and it avoids crossing the Alps and using the bad stretch near Triest. Therefore it is faster and cheaper. "But a new project of the entente is to go around Germany on the north. It is proposed to establish ferry communi cations between Kngiaiid, Denmark and Sweden. Before the war it took at least 35 hours to go from London to Copen hagen via Hamburg and ■!."> hours from London to Stockholm." URGES SHIPPING BOARD TO BUILD FLEET OF 80.

Chicago, Dec. 13.—Weakness developed In the eorn market today, largely as a result of the fact that the government crop report was construed as bearish. The close was nervous at the same as yesterday's finish to %c lower with January $1.84'^ to $1.34% and May $1.31% to $1.32. Oats gained Is to %. In pro visions the outcome varied from 37c de cline to 12c advance. - Corn traders took special notice of gov ernment figures, Bhowing an increase in the yield of corn as compared with prospective heavy sales of Canadian wheat to the United States counted also to some extent as a bearish factor. De clines which followed were due, however, more to lack of support than to any great pressure. Rallies during the last part of the session came about chiefly through week end covering by shorts and because railroads were expected to give attention next week almost alto gether to moving coal. Comparative firmness in the oats mar ket was ascribed to scantiness of receipts and to predictions of a falling off of the visible supply total on Monday. Unloading by holders of lard had a de pressing effect on the provision market. Corn—December: Open, $1.40; high, $1.41; low, $1.39M?; close. $1.4014.
