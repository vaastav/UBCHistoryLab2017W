There is cause for rejoicing on the part of friends of both Kngland and Ireland over the bright prospect of a peaceful settlement of the troubles in the latter country. Apparently the leng-standing quarrel Is on the point of ending with credit to both sides. The conclusion of the negotiations at London came with a dramatic sud denness that surprised the world. Only a few hours l>efore the proceed ings had apparently ended In failure. A last-minute effort was made. De parting delegates were summoned for one more meeting. The form of an ag eement was submitted. It will be interesting to learn the details of that last session, with civil war again threatened in Ireland, with countless lives in the balance, and with some final plea bringing about the meeting of minds that had been so often ap proached and as often blocked. Under the terms of the agreement Ireland is to be a free state, on the same basis as Canada and the other British dominions. I'lster is to have n month in which to decide whether to become a part of this organization or to remain outside, in closer union with Great Britain. There is to be no coercion, no religious domination, no discrimination, and the oath of al legiance to the state includes an oath of fidelity of the king "in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland with Great Britain and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British common wealth of nations." This will not be quite the state to which the Sinn Fein has aspired and for which the long-drawn battle has been fought. Ireland will remain part of the British dominion, but free in all the essentials of self-government. There will be no "republic." but an administration similar to that of Can ada, with a parliament, a premier and ministry and a governor general named by the crown. It will be for all practical purposes a state independent of the government at London, with certain responsibilities and limitations. Ireland will not have the status of a nation entitled to representation at foreign capitals, but it will make its own laws, lay its own taxes and in every essential respect be Independent. This is a happy consummation. Ire land's many friends in America will rejoice. The pity is that the result could not have been reached without the bloodshed and misery of the past few years, without the bitterness of conflict and the suffering of a divided people. But if Ireland will now pros per and develop as her people deserve; if remission from rancorous politics and strife permits the material and spiritual advancement of the Irish which their capacities justify, perhaps this cost in sorrow will not have been too great. The infinite pity is that so wise a solution was not reached manv years ago. But historians may find, later, that it was necessary for Ireland and Eng land to pass through the travail in order to reach the goal of an equitable adjustment. In this crisis, which all pray will be the final one. the men who held the fate of the island in their hands were wise ar.d patient and gen erous in their views. To those whose signatures were affixed to the agree ment of London, which wili stand as Ireland's Magna Charta, are due the thanks of all the civilized world for their skill in finding a way to peace. In seeking to aid an ill-conditioned world. Uncle Sam is under some re sponsibility to preserve his strength and avoid the causes of malady else where. If universally applied, a Supreme Court decision that "importunity" and "dogging" arc unjustifiable an noyances wi'l seriously hinder a great deal of so-called salesmanship. A state of peace lasting as long as the preliminary discussions would be a considerable gain to humanity. The Inequitable Borland Law. In point of the most important recommendation in their annual re port, the Commissioners are on solid ground of public approval and of sub stantial equity. It is to be hoped that they will secure from Congress that which they now recommend, modift- J cation of the so-called Borland law, I which puts an unjust burden upon the | owners of abutting property for the i Improvements of streets in the Dis- j trict. When the Borland law was enacted I St was denounced as inequitable. In j Its practice it has worked serious hardship, and has checked rather than promoted the improvement of the Dlatrlct's streets. At no time has it bean accepted, and the District has hoped for its repeal from session to session. Now the Commissioners have formally asked its amendment and the property owners hope for its full repeal. Under this law whenever any road way la paved half the cost to the width of forty feet is tAsessed against the abutting property and the remain ing half is met by appropriations divided between the District and the federal revenues according to the cur rent ratio. Thus on a forty-foot . street an abutting property owner paya half the cost for the distance op poelte his property plus his share as a taxpayer of the District's 60 per cent at tha remaining half. .And he further more part bia abare of the ?0 per cant of the cost of improving every other street in the District. In the present conditions of traffic and universal use of motor cars, every street In Washington Is as important as every other street. The property owner of the northwest has a direct Interest In the condition of the streets of the southeast. The urban resident has a keen interest in the condition of the suburban thoroughfares. It is impossible to differentiate. It is in equitable to put street improvements upon a block-by-block basis of pay ment. Those who are In the space affected by a proposed street improve ment are naturally reluctant when they are faced with the heavy direct assessment for the cost under the Bor land law, and their influence is thrown against such an improvement. Thus throughout the District the tendency is to resist street improvements rather than to urge them, with the consequence that the development of | the capital is retarded. Mo iflration of the Borland law is a matte,* of simple justice. It should be effected without any embarrassment in Congress, and in the face of the Com missioners' urgent recommendation it is hoped that this at least will be done if Congress will not go so far as to repeal it. The President and Harmony. This from the President's message deserves, and is certain to receive, very careful consideration on Capitol Hill: Ours is a popular government through political parties. We divide along political lines, anil I would ever huve it so. I do not mean that par tisan preferences should hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and patriotic official duty. We saw partisan lines utterly obliterated when war imperiled, and our faith in the republic was riveted anew. We ought not find these par tisan lines obstructing the expeditious solution of the urgent problems of peace. Granting tha: we are funda mentally a representative popular government, with political parties the governing agencies. I believe the political party in power should as sume responsibility, determine upon policies in the conference which sup plements conventions and election [ campaigns. and then strive for achieve- ; j meat through adherence to the accepted I policy. The President wants legislation on . the tariff question, on questions re- i tating to agriculture, on questions re-1 lating to capital and labor, and on I other questions, and he wants and ex-1 pects the republican party to shape j the legislation. It was the republican party which received the mandate from the people in November. 1920, and that party is now in full control in Congress. It is responsible, and should rise to its responsibility. This is a gentle nudge to the repub licans to get together and stay to gether. They are not together now, and have not been since they took charge. Divisions early appeared, and hav? been multiplying. Unless healed, they will spell disaster, and Novem ber, 1922, is only eleven months away. The President has knowledge of these divisions from requests to heal some of them himself. Doubtless he is willing to do all in his power. But he ought not thus to be drawn into factionism. Congress should heal it self. Harmony, if possible, cannot be j too early established. The session be-1 gins with a crowded card, and dili gence will be required to dispose of it in time for seasonable adjournment. Factionism causes delay, and delays growing out of factionism are usually prejudicial to good legislation. A Deserved Honor. Residents of Columbia Heights paid tribute last night to Judge Charles S. Bundy, for twenty-five years a mem ber of the citizens' association of the community and its president for many years. His achievements as leader were extolled, and his character as a man lauded. The "Nestor of Co lumbia Heights," as he was called, came into his own, among the pleas- j ant well wishes of friends and neigh-1 bors. The Star also wishes to extend lt? greetings to Judge Bundy. and felici tate him upon his long and successful1 career in civic work for the District: of Columbia. As chairman of the com-1 mittee on parks and reservations of the Board of Trade he has rendered I especially valuable and notable com munity service. At the ripe old age of i ninety years this patriarch among those who fight for Washington thor oughly deserves the respect and esteem in which he is held. Since Judge Bundy began his work as a member of the Columbia Heights association the citizen associations have seen a remarkable growth. From bodies dealing solely with local im provements, peculiarly those minor but needed improvements which every community desires, the citizens' asso ciations have grown in membership, achievement and power with the pass ing years. They have made them selves felt in the halls of Congress, and have impressed themselves upon Washington, the capital, as exponents of local public sentiment. In this work Judge Bundy, with his high spirit of civic pride and right eousness, his abiding faith in the great destiny of the National Capital, has played a large part. The citizenry of Washington congratulates him. It will probably be a long time be : fore a complete understanding is reached as to world affairs, if an ac i curate knowledge of the details of j internal Chinese politics is regarded J as a necessary preliminary. In addition to statesmen and inter preters, Japan brought along some lightning calculators. The Spoken Hetaage. In delivering his messages to Con gress by word of mouth, Mr. Wilson revived an almost forgotten custom. Messages in writing delivered by a secretary, or an executive clerk, had for many years been the only wear. Instantly, however, there was ap proval on Capitol Hill of the change. Though not an orator in the accepted sense of the word, Mr. Wilson reads well, and ho read his messages to Con gress with line effect. Moreover, he provided a brilliant function. The assembling of House and Senate in the spacious hall of the former, with the galleries parked with an eager crowd of men and woftien, became a sort of holiday, with every body dreased up and somewhere to go. Mr. Harding w wall advlaad In continuing the revived custom.~ He la both orator and good reader, and he puts a message "over" In very effec tive style. ? A , Yesterday's audience was augment ed by many distinguished visitors to the country, in attendance in one capacity or another on the armament conference, and visitors and home folks together presented a picture that will long be remembered by those who saw It. Maybe the old custom has returned to stay. As Mr. Wilson made, and Mr. Harding Is making, a success of it, why change back to the old form, with an uninspired reading clerk dron ing out a long paper to a small num ber of inattentive legislators and great gaps of empty seats in the gal leries? The Hember From Oklahoma. Miss Robertson, the representative from Oklahoma, will seek a second term. The first, she confesses, is prov ing exciting. Critics here, critics there, critics yonder. Still, undismayed, she will try her fortune again. This is the spirit. Politics is ap ex citing game. The more active the participant, the livelier the game, and, often, the sharper the criticism. Miss Robertson makes but one com plaint. She is not getting her share of the "pie," and she is growing a little insistent on that point. Her con stituents want to be remembered. They are hungry, and frankly avow the fact. She should make a strenuous effort to succeed herself. A few terms in the House will bring her much in formation about critics, and how to handle them; about "pie," and how to secure liberal helpings. In a word. Miss Robertson, really to enjoy life on Capitol Hill and serve her constituents at the top of her capacity, must become a veteran. She must come often, and make a deep study of legislative duties. Miss Rankin got an excellent start in the House. She spoke but seldom, but spoke well, and made a good impression. Probably if she had of fered for re-election she would have won. But ambition seized her. She of fered for the Senate, and was de feated. As a rule, promotion comes with time. One term in the House, no mat ter how useful or distinguished, is not a sufficient foundation on which to stand for the Senate. A President of the .United States is always contemplated by the people as more or less under temptation to seek more executive power. Mr. Harding s statement, "Encroachment upon the functions of Congress or attempted dictation of its policy are not to be thought of, much less attempted," :s sufficiently candid and explicit to al lay any such fears so far as the pres ent administration is concerned. The abolition of the gold standard cannot be relied on to prevent war. Men fought when tobacco, rum and even wampum were used instead of money. Lenin's idea of requiring Russians to do without money has to a remark able degree been put info operation. Teaching them to do without food Is a harder matter. The request by President Harding for corn and wheat for starving Rus sia is one of the biggest and most ad mirable Christmas suggestions yet of fered. Some of the articles on the confer ence by British story writers leave the reader in doubt as to whether the expression is one of downright gloom or only of an English sense of humor. The real effects of the parley may not be fully in evidence until after the delegates have gone home and had some heart-to-heart talks with their constituents. It becomes evident that Lloyd George will not be permitted to take down his "busy day" sign, even dur ing the Christmas holidays. Cancellation of debts might have to be deftly managed to prevent it from being a temptation to incur new ones on the slightest provocation. The pecuniary requirements of Washington have increased. So has the size of the city. 

SHOOTING STABS. BY PHILANDEH JOHNSON. Bargaining. Bargaining for bread an' meat. Bargaining for beans. Everybody that you meet Would fain increase his means. Bargaining for house and lot, Or for the seas that roll; Bargaining for ships and shot And for the world's control. We talk about ideals high And hear the angels sing; But everybody, by and by. Gets down to bargaining. Compulsory Optimism. "Are you an optimist?" "I've got to be one," replied Senator Sorghum. "So many of my constitu ents hold me personally responsible for the way the world's affairs go that I don't dare weaken." Clothes No Protection. . "Women are more robust than they used to be." ' ? "The way they stand cold weather," replied Miss Cayenne, "would Indicate that they are." Complications Avoided. Old Santa Claus secures a sleigh. Some reindeer he engages. He keeps his problems far away From railway rates and wages. Taking No Chances. "What makes you so suspicious of the liquor now in circulation?" "The fact." replied Uncle Bill Bot tlctop. "that I never yet saw a boot legger who looked as if he ever touched a drop."

Who's Who Conference XV?Lord Lee of FareHam ? ?T""NRO Patria Omnia" Is the L-/ heraldic motto of Lord Lee I of Fareham. first lord of the admiralty and delegate to the conference on the limitation of armament from Great Britain, and to such a degree has he carried this "all for country" uppermost in his mind throughout his life that one instinctively thinks of it in connec tion with this British peer. Serving in the army, in parliament and in numerous high official positions, this present post^ in connection with the Washington parley is only a con tinuation of a career devoted tire lessly to service for the homeland. After giving thirty years of his life to Great Britain, he added gen erosity and sacrifice to his faithful devotion to energy to a cause by making a gift of his beautiful estate, Checquers, to the nation mo that her prime ministers, rich or poor, would have a home befitting the dignity of the office. This is typical of the man. It was not simply a monetary gift that any very rich man could bestow. Checquers was the only home Lord and iAdy I^ee had and they had grown strongly attached to it by years of planning and improving the old mansion. It was a pure sacrifice of self for an ideal. This is not the first timk-Lord Lee has been in Washington in an offi cial capacity. Following the Spanish American war, he was military at tache at the British embassy here and made many life long friends by his congeniality and attractive per sonality. It was at this time that he married the present Lady Lee. who was then Miss Kuth Moore, the daugh ter of J. G. Moore of New York. Dur ing that war he sreved as military attache to the United States Army and distinguished himself and won . the hearts of officers and men alike by caring for the wounded under fire. It was at this time that his friendship with Theodore Roosevelt started. They were on the most cordial terms and corresponded frequently up until a month before the latter's death. Ten years before the Spanish war Lord Lee, when just twenty years old, had been adjutant of the Hongkong volunteers and at that time he created a sensation in inner miitary circes for an act of valor that gained him the highest commendation. Disguised as a coolie or working man he gained I admittance to the forts at Vladivos i tok and. at the greatest risk of his life, made complete drawings of the fortifications for the British army. The days spent on this mission were filled with enough adventures for a , moving picture scenario, but Lord Lee is most modest in telling of the j episode. For ten years Lord Lee served in the army. He joined the royal ar ! tillery in 188* and served in the far east, in the United States, on the Isle of Wight and for five years he was ; professor of strategy and tactics at I the Royal Military' College in Canada. ! He retired in 1900 as a lieutenant col j onel. Wben the world war started | he Immediately volunteered and served as a colonel on the staff in France. Twice he was mentioned in dispatches while he was serving on j special service. i Lord Lee is the son of Rev. Mel ville Lee. As a boy he was extremely quiet, serious and studious, not at all interested in outdoor sports or other youthful pastimes. He was educated in Cheltenham. Woolwich. Immediately after the conclusion of his romantic career in the army, he entered parliament to continue serv ing his country along other lines and the tasks he has taken on his shoul 

LORD LEE OF FAREUAM. ders In these later years have been even more arduous and almost as in teresting as his early military days For eighteen years ho was a conser vative in the house of commons, al ways assuming more and more re sponsibility. Jn 1912 he devised, framed and pushed through parlia ment the white slave traffic act which brought him prominently before the whole nation. He was chairman of the parliamentary atrial defense committee, eivil lord of the admiral ty, and during the early part of the war was parliamentary secretary to the minister of munitions and per sonal military secretary to the Sec retary of State for War?then Lloyd George. At the same time he never refused to take responsible positions in connection with hospitals, colleges, societies and the like that demanded more of his energy. He seems to have always had an unbounded capa city for hard work, and his quick, acute mind proved ever an asset. Lord Lee, G. B. E. X. P., K. C. H., Knight of Grace of St. John of Jeru salem, otherwise Arthur Hamilton Lee, was created a baron in 1918. The title was bestowed on him In recogni tion of the magnificent work he ac complished during the critical period of the war, when as director general of food production, he -was respon sible for keeping the nation fed and averting any disastrous shortage of supplies. It was a tremendous under taking and one that required an in domitable spirit and endless effort. He made innumerable enemies and be came most unpopular for ordering parks, hunting preserves and the like to be put under cultivation, but those same antagonists now realize that it was his utter disregard for all save the nation's weal and his ruthless driving force that helped materially in the ultimate victory of Britain. Lord Lee has been first lord of the admiralty since February. Before that he was minister of agriculture I and fisheries, and in that capacity was a great success. His present po sition makes him indispensable in the naval questions of the present con ference, since he is in the closest touch with British maritime problems, but he is also well versed in the far eastern questions, because of the years he spent in China and other Asiatic countries. 

EDITORIAL DIGEST Parliaments of Man. The Savannah News (democratic) expresses the conclusion at which most American papers have arrived when it says that "everything that is j done and said at the Washington con ference points to the necessity for a continuing body to seek to ameliorate friction among nations." And the Kansas City Journal (republican) adds that the international gathering "is starting a good work that must be perpetuated." Because of this convic- [ tion the feeling is, strong that Presi dent Harding took the step that "those who have hoped for great results from the conference have been longing for above all else, the only thing that really matters," as the Charleston News and Observer (democratic) puts It when he proposed "a continuing series of international conferences whose fruition may be an association of nations." If "friends of the league of nations still hold that the vision on which It was based was the main thing and that methods and persons are quite subordinate." the Buffalo Express (independent republican) contends 'hat "they should be heartily applaud ing the efforts of the present con ference and the suggestion of more conference.'; as a positive advance of the world toward the end which they seek." But if this is a call to battle, few newspaper "friends of the league" are Inclined ttf answer it. If Mr. Harding can "enlist the great powers and most of the little ones, and if he can, in addition, bring in Germany," the New York Globe (In dependent) concedes that "he will be doing about what Mr. Wilson set out to do, and will be entitled to the sup port of all the proponents of the Wil son league." And he will receive it, the New York Times (independent democratic) declares. "They will not stand aloof in nar row criticism. They will rather wel come every evidence, however slow, toward the objects which they have been cherishing. They have stood for principles, not forms. They have cared more for things than for names." If Mr. Harding "knows a better 'ole" than the rejected league "let him go to It," counsels the Richmond News Leader (independent democratic): "he has only to disclose It to elicit the sympathy of democrats." But there are nevertheless, a few democratic voices distinctly unsympathetic to the proposals so far developed. The Day ton'News (democratic) finds the sug gestions "Intangible," and backed largely by a spirit of "anything but the league," an effort "to scrap an Institution that holds within Its power the opportunities to render cOnspicu ous service to humanity and to sub stitute for it "a dream association, a will-'o-the-wisp that has neither form nor substance." "Quite a lady-like affair." indeed, the Chattanooga News (democratic) calls It; simply an as semblage of nations "once a year to consider the state of the union, so to speak," at which "it would proba bly be In order for those without sin to shake their forefingers at those who had not been observing the rules of the game ? ? ? and to tell them how very, very naughty they had been" To the Milwaukee Journal (independent) the! plan "sounds un comfortably like ithe Hague confer ence where nations met, discussed problems and passed resolutions whose utter futility was to be at tested by the most terrible war in history." But to this the Sioux City Tribune '(independent) replies that "precisely because of that terrible war" the "awakened repugnance of the peoples of the world" will briftg to the new association of. nations a strength of conviction and earnest ness of purpose that The Hague meet ings never had. . ' , President Harding suggests "a pool ing of Intelligence, Interest and friendly mutual understanding." as the Minneapolis Tribune (republican) phrases it, "a simple plan of volun tary co-operation of equal sover eigns," to which the Washington Post (independent) think* tb* world wlU ? f ' ? ?? V *'? '?turn as to ttie mountain of refuge." ! That such co-operation is possible "without the sacrifice of national in- ' dependence," the Philadelphia Bulle- i tin (independent republican) is con-; vinced. While to the Knoxville Sentinel (Independent democratic) this "Hard ing association of nations" is so closely patterned after the "Wilson league of nations'* that "only the difference of a word in the name distinguishes them," the Pittsburgh Chronicle - Telegraph (republican) ! sees it as a "vastly different" organi zation from that which "the people of America rejected so emphatically." In its relation to the existing league, the proposed association "cannot be regarded as a rival," the St. Louis Globe-Democrat (repub lican) thinks, "unless it takes a form more definite than now appears and an aggressiveness not now in dicated." The New York Evening World (democratic) is disposed to treat President Harding's "plan of international co-operation" kindly, "with the serene certainty that neither Mr. Harding nor anybody else can prevent it from going even tually a great deal further." The First Geographic Maps of America Were Work of Italians. Italy not only gave birth to the dis coverer of the New World, but she has also contributed to the exploita tion and to the early mapping; of America. The first geographic map of Amer ica was printed in Ttaly in the year 1508. It was made by a German and was very inaccurate. In 1511 the Viscount of Maggiolo and Bernardo Silvano, both Italians, published the first accurate maps of the New World, although they show ed only the general aspect of the American continent and did not give any idea of the interior region, nor did they show at all the polar re gions and the islands of both oceans. In 1548 a man from Piedmonte. G. Gastaldi. who was believed to have been the best cartographer of his time, made a map of the new conti nent which is worthy of note, and in this map some attempt was made to show the mountains, lakes and rivers in the interior; also the meridians and parallels are shown, as well as the degrees of latitude and longitude and the polar circles and the tropics. In this map the form of America Is almost exact G.
