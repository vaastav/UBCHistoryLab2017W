A few days after the recent elec tion W. J. Bryan, in an interview given outat8an Antonio, stated that, if tendered him, he might accept a fourth presidential nomination at the hands of the Democratic party. This i announcement gives emphasis to a question of grave concern to Demo crats, particularly in the South. Before going directly into it let us indulge in a short retrospect. On March 4th, 1893, Grover Cleve- ! land was a second time inaugurated President of the United States. At fi the time of his nomination and elec tion his views on the silver question fi were perfectly known to the country. ; No public man of the time had a better known, a stronger, or a more consistent anti-silver record than he. ed 

RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT. Editor Greenwood Commonwealth : The writer, who is a Democrat and has never voted for a candidate who was not a Democrat, asks for space in your paper for the following com munication, knowing that you publish it without committing your self to the views it ' ontains. can During his first term as president he had, in three annual messages to Congress, urgently recommended the immediate repeal of the Bland-AUi son silver law and the total stoppage of the coinage of the silver dollar. In the early part of 1891, when he was a private citizen but was being talked of as a piobable candidate for a third presidential nomination, he delivered (or published) an address in which he reiterated his views, de claring in the plainest terms his un qualified hostility to silver. Never theless he was the next year again choosen to be the standard-bearer of his party. At the time of his nomi nation and election the Sherman Act (passed during Harrisnn'u tration) was in force, which required the Treasury to purchase 4,500,000 ounces of silver bullion per month ■' at the current market price, and is sue therefor currency known as "Sherman notes" redeemable "in of a ty J era to of 16

The platform on which he was nominated contained the fol lowing : "We denounce the Republican legiHtation fcnown as the Sherman Act of 18.K) as a cowardly makeshift fraught with possibilities of danger in the future which should make all of its supporters, as well as its auth or anxums for its speedy repeal." A resolution favoring the free and ja t t a coina £ e silver by the United States alone was presented t0 we Convention and rejected by a j viva voce vute of about ten to one, : Five months after hri inaugura tion President Cleveland called Con Kress together in extraordinary ses i sion and submitted to it a message I urgently recommending the repeal of l hc Sherman Act, the country be-1 big then in the throes of financial panic, attributable in his judgment largely to the compulsory ! inflation of the currency with the "Sherman notes" and the const quent fi pav y hoarding and exportation of Kold. The message precipitated a fi erce struggle between the friends ; an( i opponents of silver in Congr and an even fiercer one between the President and those Senators and W Representatives of his owu party who favored the liberal coinage of fi silver—a struggle that lasted con- aft tinuously for three months and end ed in a complete victory for Presi dent Cleveland, who secured the passage of the repealing act, By this course the President incurred a severe ess, the bitter resentment of the "friends )' of silver," including the pro-silver fi° Democrats, many of whom joined in S the savage denuniciation of him as a "turncoat," a "traitor" to his par ty and a "tool of Wall Street." In J une, 1905, a non-partisan conven tion of silver Democrats, Populists and silver Republicans was held in Memphis, the result of which was a general movement by silver Demo P thr- cy. „f „IV., era ta for the to quote their language— ougli organization ot the Democrats of the several states favoring the free and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver on terms of equality, at 16 <o 1 as a necessary and proper 'a complete control of the national ganizafion of the party, and adopting ja platform which called for the free [and unlimited coinage of both gold and silver at 16 to 1 independent of j any other nation. William J. Bryan : was chosen to lead the crusade for "financial independence." The "free stiver" question'was made the "para mount issue", with the triumphant I Proclamation that the parly had at. las l returned to its "ancient faith"; tfiough upon what grounds this istratiou, before the Democratic pat W was born. The first Democratic President, Thomas Jefferson—fouu fi er of the Democratic party—soon aft er his first inauguration, by exe eutive order arbitrarily stopped the coinage of silver dollars, making a deacl fetter of that part of the law which permitted their coinage. This order remained in force for thirty m 'ans of controlling the action of the National Democratic Convention of lbffG upon this vitally important question." When the National Con vent ion met the next year the Mem phis programme was carried thor Dugh, the silver Democrats seounng OP ly claim was made it is difficult to per ceive, when we recall that the Dem ocratic party, nor any considerable element of it, bad ever shown espec ial friendliness for silver until more than a decade after the Civil War. The law providing for the free coin age of both gold and silver was en acted during Washington's admin )' eal ' 8 , until, during the administra fi° n °f Andrew Jackson, another S rea l Democratic president, it was xaftified by changing the ratio so as to prevent tile coinage of silver to any consid erable extent. This legislation was achieved under the leadership of tfi° a - H Benton, Jacksons great lieutenant in the Senate. Its avowed act of Congress an P ltr P ose was to supply the country with » onhl jnstead of silver a curreu cy. RUd suctr-nm- . . ..— suit of this policy of Jefferson, Jack son and Benton—which was further carried out in the Coinage Act of 1853—only 8,000,000 silver dollars were coined in the 80 years from of 1793 to 187,3. The elsthirm of 1896 contained another plauk which should not be passed over without notice, viz., that which by obvious innuendo raigned President Cleveland for ing the federal authority for the pro tection of the right» of a sorely suf fering public in keeping the rail roads open to inter state commerce and the mails during the great rail way strike of 1904. This plank was proposed by Governor Altgeld of Il linois as a "rebuke" to the President. It also contained a plank assailing the 1 nited States Supreme Court for its decision in the income tax cases. ar U8 These three proposals impressed the platform with a distinct and startline revolutionary character. Given < ffect in legislative, executive and judicial policy, it would have suddenly changed the standard of value to a material extent, denied to the federal government its power to keep inter slate railways open to commerce and the mails during do mestic riots, and rendered the Su preme Court of thei United States subservient to temporary popular impulses and passions. Is it sur prising that the party met with dis astrous defeat that jjpar? The leaders of the new movement, many of whom were Southern men, of course anticipated the exodus from the party of a considerable part of its conservative j element, but thought the defection'wold be more than offset, by accessions of Populists, Socialists and radical Republicans. However, the experiment not only brought disaster in the general re sult, but wholly failed to restore tho South to its old position of leader ship in the Democratic party, mere ly transferring the dictatorship from New York and the East to Nebraska and the populistic Wit. a sponsit>" lUÿ " attached te> Bryan tor the course of events. He ran in 1896 made for rather than by Bryan's real responsibility be on issues him. gan after his defeat in 1896. Im mediately thereafter he started campaign for the nomination in 1900, first step publishing his book "The First Battle" in which he an nounced that the fight against the gold standard was just begun. And | the platform of 1900, written in totol by him, or at his dictation, contain-' cd an txpress reaffirmation of "16 to 1 . notwilhstanding the people,after probably the most thorough educa tional campaign in our history, had four years before repudiated the doctrine by a decisive majority. The platform also contained a plank denying our right to hold the Philip pines, and demanding our speedy withdrawal from them, notwith standing the treat of 1899 by which we acquired them, and under which paid $20,000,(XX) for them, ould have failed of ratification in the Senate but for the open active exertions of Mr. Bryan in its behalf. The result was a more crushing de a as a same WE* A feat than it 1896. In 1904, by permission of Mr Bryan, the dictatorship of the party temporarily passed back to the East, and Alton B. Parker made his foolish campaign as an opponent of "anti trust" legislation at a time when the people had made up their minds that the great corporations of the country should be brought under stringent federal control. In was more that year the Bry an faction in the East and West had their revenge on the "deserters" of 1896 and 1900 by helping pile up the atupendous ma jorities under which Parker waa crushed. Aa baa been wittily said, Bryan stepped aside while Parker flung to the invincible Rooae velt like Daniel to the lions, except hat Roosevelt ate Parker." vas But he soon appeared once more in the arena, owning "the soft im peachment" of a third ambition. No serious effort waa mide to forestall him, and for more than a year it waa evident that the nomination would go again to the dictator in the Weat, and by default, though in all likeli hood it would foredoom the party to defeat. For the third time he waa nominated. The platform, being again written at hi» dictation, waa decidedly Bryaneeque. Itreaffirmed his views on the Philippine queation, ud aet forth a number ol propuaala utterly inconsistent with his well known political maxims. Though claiming to be "Jeffersonian" it con tained snch pro-centralization, anti states rights' proposals as federal h eenge for manufacturing and trading corporations engaged in inter-state commerce, and a federal law com pelling national banks to guarantee each others' deposits in a scheme that would include state hanks and necessarily bring the latter under stringent federal supervision and control. Though professing devo tion to the principal of "equal rights for all, special privileges for none," it contained a plank which, if it meant anything at all, meant the legalization of the secondary boycott, by exempting ones'right to carry on his business from protection by in junction, and so placing any busi ness man in the country at tho mer cy of labor organizations at war with their employers, though such busi ness man had no connection what ever with the matter in dispute. On thin platform and on his rec ord of twelve years Mr. Bryan ran his third race for the presidency, and with what result? A worse dc ieat than in 1900, both by popular vote and in the electoral college, though in 1900 he had been worse defeated than in 1896. Under twelve years of Bryan and Bryanism—for the Bhort Parker as cendency existed by the sufferance of Bryan—the once certain Democratic States of Delaware and West Virgin ia,the once doubtful States of Connec ticut, New York, New Jersey and In diana, and the States of Illinois and Wisconsin whichCleveland carried in 1892, Ir.ve become strongly Repub lican; while Maryland and Missouri, and even Kentucky, all once a part of the "Solid South," have become doubtful. The Democratic party as a national organization has been pwcticalJjLdeatroved in everv im. Dixon's line, no states being now certainly Democratic except Tennes see, and the Gnlf and South Atlan tic stetes. The Republican plurality against Bryan this year wasl ,200,(XX) against 850,000 in 1900 and 600, 000 in 1896; and his vote in the elec toral college was only 162 as against
