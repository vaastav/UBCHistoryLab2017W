Lowry's Thanksgiving proclama tion is indeed a beautiful piece of com position, and if our limited space would permit, we would insert it in the Ledger. —Tupelo Ledger. Maj. Grafton, for many years the able and practical writer of the Natchez Democrat, has retired as editor and is succeeded by Mr. Douglas Walworth, a good writer.

Miss Minnie Talbert, ot Hardy Station sister of our friend, It. B. Talbert, took first premium at the Jackson Fair for the best pound cake and the best white sponge cake. Young men make a note of that.- Winona Advance. The next progressive educational movement to be lookod for, is the en dowment of our colleges of a "Base Ball professorship." The only difficult ques tion to decide about it, is whether it shall be a required or elective study—Ex.

The way she came to hit upon this was from a device she used to twist her worsted. The election returns give Cleveland 49 34 per cent, of the entire vote, and Harrison 4S 05 per cent, leaving but trifle over 2 per cent for all the other candidates. The entire vote thrown was 11,285,825, which is about 1,250,000 over the ponuiar vote of 1884. B The New York AA'orld is authority for the statement that "James R.

AY. S. Bell, of MeridiaD, Miss., died on last Sunday after a short illness. This bereavement carries gloom to the bright home of our friends, but by faith this gloom will be transformed into everlasting life. Take courage, and "be ye also ready." Now who will say over ?"—Avalanche. on an Gen. Longstreet has written a letter indorsing Mahone for a seat in the Har rison cabinet as a representative of the South. Gen. seems, in linking himself reputable in politics. lie appears to prefer the distinction oi being an ally of repudiating A'irginian rather than that of the right arm of Lee.—Ex. Longstreet persists, it with the dis There is no use talking, tlie Edwards House at Jackson is the Palmer House of Mississippi, and has the brainiest and biggest proprietor in the world, and it is the only Hotel in the world with "Brad ford boys" for clerks. This is no "ad" to pay for meals. AV r e stop with relatives when in Jackson, but (always register at the Edwards House.—YY'inona Advance an A prohibition amendment to the con stitution of West Virginia was submitted to the people at the recent election, and was rejected by a majority of 40,000. This, coupled with Republican gains there, shows that the Republican party not the prohibition party. The jug seems to be equally precious to all par ties.—Picayune. A scalawag is an ex-Confederate sol dier, who after the war in which he was physically crushed by force of arms, came home to crawl and fawn before the dominant faction of his conquerers, re canting the principles which, residing in the soul of every native Southerner, are as immortal as the soul itself of constitu tional liberty and the supremacy of the white race,"—Ex.

Kemp, the division super intendent of the Aberdeen branch of I. C. K. R. has been appointed superin tendent of the M. & T. R. R., and will take charge about Jan. 1, Maj. Kemp was for some time the efficient and pop ular depot agent of Grenada. Here he made many warm friends who will glad to hear of his appointment' He an energetic and experienced railroad, man, and will doubtless give satisfac tion 10 tile public as well as his employ ers. He is also a gentleman of varied information, and social and genial in his manners. While on this subject, we would suggest that Maj. Kemp's "storm or cyclone pit," what he had built here some years ago, be moved to Memphis, or a new one built there. We have no doubt of his physical courage to meet men and tilings generally, but when comes to 'storms' or 'cyclones,' he imme diately yells "oli Lordy !" and down in ,his 'pit' lie goes. The St. Louis Republic remarks- ' If the Southern leading newspapers should publicly advise the Chicago anarchists to throw bombs at the police and burn buildings by way of redressing their griev ances, and should taunt them with lack of spirit because they uid not persist in enforcing their notions of their rights by such means, the Chicago Tribune would be shocked at it as another exhibition ol the total depravity of 'Rebel Brigadi ers.' Yet that is precisely what the Tribune is preaching to the Southern negroes when it reproaches them with not being willing to kill and burn, if necessary, to assert what they conceive to be their rights." Mr. Alfred Daniel of Douglas county, Ga., is rather a remarkable character. He is S2 years old, was never sick a day in bis life, was never in bed at sun up, and never lost a tooth, has been to six log rollings this year, lifts more than most men, often indulges in coon and ' pos sum hunting, has been a deacon in the Primitive Baptist church for fifty-eight years, was never drunk in his life and an oath never escaped his lips. He is tlie iuther of 26 children—15 now living —has 70 grandchildren and a number of great-grandchildren, A good old colored brother is said to have sent word to the bishop to send a minister out to his church in Alexandria valley last Sunday. Ilis request was worded as follows; "Send us a Bishop to preach. It you can't send a Bishop send us a Sliding Elder, if you can't send Sliding Elder send us a Stationary Preacher, if you can't send him send us Circus Rider, if you cant spare him send us a Locus Preacher, if you can not spare a Locus Preacher send us an Exhauster." That settled it, and he got preacher.—Anniston Watchman. Newspapers as a general thing, seem to take a malicious delight in poking all manner of fun at the bustle, says the Wynne (Ark.) Ripsaw. Tnis is hardly right, for the editor of that same pape r would hold one of the aforesaid bustles, when properly attached of course, on bis lap for hours at the time and never think growing tired. The President's message, which was sent to Congress at their meeting last Monday, is a very long but able docu ment, and is worthy of perusal by all persons who wish to know anything about our public affairs as they now stand. Elsewhere in this issue will he found a complete synopsis of the Mes sage, which reflects a piece of| enterprise on the part of the Sentinel in getting it out at this early a day in which few, if an y wreekly papers in this State can equal. Senator John L. Morgan has been re elected United States Senator from Ala bama as his own successor. Since Alabama first honored Geu. Morgan with tlie Senatorial toga in 1877, he has occupied an advanced place -among the able men who have represented the South in that body.—Ex. President elect Harrison is said to have engaged pews in all the Presbyteri an churches at Washington. There is a method in ins religion. Distinguished strangers who go to church to worship God and stare at the American presi dent will not know where to find him. —Picayune. Fr e <l Dougina Keys. "Tlie white people of the South will rule the South. Intelligence will win. is ridiculous to pretend that the peo ple who have the wealth, the people who have the railways, the people who have the electric telegraph, the people who have the steam locomotion, the people who have the steam navigation, the peo ple who have the commerce of the lion are going to he dominated by the poor and the despised and the illiterate negro. There is not tlie least danger of anything of the kind, and I sometimes think that our ^Southern white people know that there exists no such danger. All that the whites of the South have to is to treat the negro justly, and he will listen to them before he will listen to auy other people, from the North or else where. It is impossible for the negroe rule: It is impossible." na— Duelling House for lien I A new Dwelling House containing two room9, dining room and kitchen, and other conveniences, near the public square, now occupied by A. 8.
