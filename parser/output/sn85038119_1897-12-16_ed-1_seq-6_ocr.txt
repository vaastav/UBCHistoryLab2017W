An assay of the ore tak en from one prospect ran $1,750 to the ton. Meager particulars have been received in El Paso, Texas, from San Simon, a small station just east of AVillcox, A. T., on the Southern Pacific, of a train hold up. Train No. 20, the sunset limited, had just left Steins Pass, N. M., near the Arizona line, when the engineer noticed a danger signal in front and immediately applied the air brakes. No sooner was the train brought to a stop than five men stepped out from their hiding places near the track, all heavily armed. One cov ered the engineer and fireman with his Winchester, while the others gave their attention to the train proper, more espe cially to the express ear, firing their guns in the air and otherwise frightening the passengers. At this point the guards jn the express car took a hand in the fusil lade. Thirty or forty shots are said to have been fired by both sides. One Wells Fargo guard, Jennings by name, succeed ed in killing Robber Culleu, who was nearest to the car and who was evidently the leader, for as soon as the other rob bers noticed his body lying on the ground they lost courage and made a break for their horses, but another bullet from Jen nings' Winchester evidently struck one of the fleeing robbers, as he was seen to fall and was assisted out of range by his com rades.

Marshal Blanco has cabled to Senor de Lome, Spanish minister at Washington, a request that he tender Blanco's condo lence to President McKinley on the death of the President's mother. The Agricultural Department at Wash ington issues the following: "The special wheat investigation instituted by the De partment of Agriculture indicates a crop of 5'JO,000,000 bushels. These figures are subject to slight modification iu tho final report." The Agricultural Department at Wash ington has issued the following, signed by John Hyde: "The department's final esti mates of the production of the principal crops are based largely on the December returns. The only information now avail able relates to the average farm price of certain products on the first day of the present month. The farm price of corn, as indicated, averages 20.5 cents per bushel, against 21.5 cents last year; that of oats, 21.5 cents, against 1S.7 cents last year; that of barley, 37.7 cents, against 32.3 cents last year; that of rye, 41.7 cents, against 40.9 cents last year; that of buckwheat, 42.1 cents, against 39.2 cents last year; that of hay, $0.03 per ton, against $G.55 last year. The averages for the products not given are withheld for revision, as are also the estimates of the acreage of winter wheat and rye and the condition of these products." Secretary Alger of the War Department at Washington says it was not true that his order to have the reprimand recently administered to Captain Lovering read nt all at army posts was the result of in formation that the'otneers at Fort Sheri dan, Chicago, intended to ignore the mat ter as far as possible. He said it was suggested to him that some effort might be made to suppress the reprimand, and, as he felt very anxious that the widest possible publicity be given to the fact that a reprimand had been administered in the case, lie thought it best to issue a general order, directing that the docu- ment be read in full to the .vitomissloncd and non-commissioned officers and private soldiers not only at Fort Sheridan, but at every army post in the United States. As n result of fJi'ii. A!"pr's iHnr on the sub J ject, Captain Lovcring's offense and the proceedings of the court martial which tried him will be published from one end of the country to the other. The repri mand will be discussed at every garrison ami at every club where army officials are iu the habit of assembling. From this time forward Captain Levering will be a marked man in the army. lie has not only been severely reprimanded by the commander-iu-ehicf, but his conduct has been ventilated more thoroughly than has any case before brought within the juris diction of a military tribune. 

FOREIGN. The entire Chilian cabinet has resigned. The event has caused a sensation. The cabinet was appointed last August, to suc ceed the ministry formed on Aug. 9, un der the premiership of Orrego IIuco, which in turn succeeded the Antuucz cabinet that retired on June 23 last. A Peking dispatch to the Loudon Times says that China haying complied with her demands, Germany undertakes to evacu ate Kio-Chou at a date to be fixed here after, and will receive instead as a coal ing station the Sam-Sah inlet, in the prov ince of Fo Kien, over against the Island of Formosa. A cable from London states that the British-American corporation has floated $5,000,000 and has secured the La Roi, Josie and eight of the Rossland mines, also the Alaska Commercial Company, the town site of Dawson City and claims on Bonanza, Eldorado, Bear and other Klondike creeks. T. Estrada Palma, representative of the Cuban provisional government iu New York, received from Gen. Maximo Go mez a copy cf a proclamation he has re cently issuefi rejecting autonomy. The document, which is addressed to the "ar my of liberation, reads: Patriotic Sol diers Who Are Fighting for the Emanci pation of the Cuban People Gen. Blan co, the substitute of the bloodthirsty Woyler, who despises and threatens us, 'comes to establish new features' in this war. He says so in his proclamation to the country and to the army, but we do not require to make any changes, and the war will be carried on by us just the same as wo commenced it, since all my cir culars are in accordance with civilized warfare. Everything that helps the en emy must be destroyed, and everything that seems to harass him must be achiev ed. That is our right. Our purposes have been well defined and sufficiently proclaimed to the world. We aim at the independence of our country. Cuba for tho Cubans. America for the Americans. To attain these high and honorable results we rely on our pledged honor, the posses sion of tho island, and the lapse of time. Resources to carry on the struggle will spring forth from our resistance. The hopes of Spain to subdue us nre already blasted. Gen. Blanco represents her last and final resort." IN GENERAL. Bradstreet's commercial report for the week says: "Mild weather throughout most of the country has interfered to some extent with the distribution of winter-weight clothing and other seasonable goods, and trade from first hands is quiet er even than last week. Jobbers and re tailers, however, report a steadily increas ing aud in some regions very active busi ness in holiday goods, groceries and kin dred products. Favorable reports come from Chicago, Kansas City, St. Louis and St. Paul. The price situation is one of sustained and even aggressive strength. Wheat is higher, and all other cereals have sympathized with wheat. Coffee, copper, cotton, dairy products, leaf to bacco and raw sugar are also among the prominent staples which have been en hanced in value. The decreases have been few and slight. Cereal exports con tinue very large, though showing a falling off from last week's heavy total. Total exports of wheat and flour from the Unit ed States and Canada this week aggre gated 0,005,(338 bushels, against CG99.000 bushels last week. Corn exports also show a falling off, aggregating 3,06S,000 bush els this week, against 4,585,000 bushels hut week." There is more gold in the world by $215,900,000 than there was a year ago, writes the Washington correspondent of the Chicrgo Journal. The total stock of the world's gold, including all used in the arts and for purposes of money through civilization, is estimated by the director of the mint, in his report just issued, to be $4,359,C00,000. This is an increase from $4,143,700,000 in 1S9G. A certain amount of this enormous increase has come from recently discovered mines in Alaska. A large amount comes also from Russian aud South American mines, and much from the regular sources which con tinue in operation. The decreased rela tive value of silver has discouraged the nu'ning of that metal, and in consequence the stock of silver shows a much smaller relative increase, the total amount in ex istence now being $4,2GS,300,000. Last year the supply was $4,230,900,000. Rus sia and the United States have been cor nering the gold market. Tho former coun try has increased her supply of the pres cious metal $9S,300,000, while the United States has gathered in $24,100,000. Austria-Hungary comes next in point of gold wealth, having $11,300,000. and the gold stocks of the United Kingdom and France are no larger than a year ago. Some in teresting figures have been gathered by Comptroller Eckels, showing the amount of money which each person has on an average in the principal civilized coun tries. According to these statistics, the citizens of France are wealthier than those of any other country, having $34.08 each of mouej" silver, gold nnd paper. The United States comes next, each of its inhabitants being entitled to $23.70. Of gold money, the Frenchman has $30.05, while the American has $9.55. The Britisher has on an average $20.05, of which $14.75 is gold. The poorest per son in the world is the Turk, who has but $4.09, about half of which is in silver and half in gold. MARKET REPORTS.

J cs&&rsfvgzel2P- .L J COMPARING TARIFF BILLS. Defenders of the Dingley tariff rise to the dignity of the occasion with as sertion for lack of argument. Chair man Dingley asserts that "in time" Ids famous deficit producer will bring in sufficient revenue to meet the expenses of the Government, and he defiantly adds that those who criticise the tariff "do not dare to make comparisons be tween the first months of the Wilson act aud the first months of the present act." This assertion was made in the face of the fact that comparisons have been made right along showing the failure of the Dingley bill to secure as much revenue as the Wilson measure, which was so roundly condemned by Repub licans. , As an example of the comparisons which have been made, Chairman Diugley's attention is called to the fol lowing figures, showing the revenue which was secured by the two tariffs during the initial four months of their operation: AVIlson act. Dingley act. First month ?1.-,OG1.000 5li.VW7.7ft2 Swond month 11.902.118 7,043,100 Third mouth 10,'JG0,0U2 0,713,401 Fourth month 11,203,043 0,S!0,O23 Four months .S4S.000.S19 $31,474,321 This presents a balance of over $14, 000,000 in favor of the Wilson bill. It should also be remembered that the revenue secured by the Wilson bill for the time iu question was collected when business was paralyzed by the panic of 1S03, while the Dingley bill was operating under the glorious influ ence of the McKinley prosperity, which is so much vaunted by the Republican press. Truly, as Mrs. Malaprop would say, "comparisons are odorous" to Chairman Dingley. Chicago Dispatch. Silver in India. It is said that a "dear" rupee will ruin the export trade of India. If a "dear" rupee will ruin tho export trade of that country, it follows Inexorably that a "cheap" rupee must foster and stimulate it. This Is exactly what the silver men in the United States have steadily claimed and what the gold ines lave just as steadily denied. Upon this point we will now simply remind our gold idolators that the "export trade" referred to is one that has been built up very largely at the expense of gold standard countries, and particu larly at the expense of the United" States. It is a rather late day, though, for the government of that country to be gin to whimper about its export trade. As has been sufficiently shown in other articles, by the closing of the Indian mint, which forced the rupee artificial ly above the l.vel of the coins of other silver-using countries, the export trade of India to those countries received a terrible blow. In fact, it was almost ruined. In trade with China, Japan, the "Straits" and .other silver countries India Is now at a great disadvantage, by reason of the rising value of the rupee. But as that rupee is still away below par in gold, which is 24 pence, she has a corresponding advantage in trade with gold standard countries. Still, upon the whole, the government of India plants itself upon narrow ground. The restoration of the par value ot the rupee would, it is true, deprive that, country of a bounty on exports to those doing business upon a gold basis. But this bounty is already lessened by the rise of the rupee, and the more it rises the smaller the bounty becomes. On tho other hand, though, it would de prive silver-using countries of a like bounty over her, so that as a mere mat 'tcr of commerce it is doubtful if India would lose anything. It is to be grave ly feared that the money-lender has got In his deadly work on the government of that country. Putting Pins in McKinley's Chair. Reed, like Caesar, is ambitious, ne has desired to be President for many years. He Is conscious that he was cheated out of the nomination to which he was by merit entitled on account of the wholesale purchase by money and promises of patronage employed by the political syndicate directed by Mark Hanna. Mr. Reed can have, un der the circumstances, no conscientious scruples about throwing obstructions in the pathway of the McKinley second term boom. Evidence is already com ing to the surface that the speaker is taking time by the forelock with one hand and putting bent pins on the chair whereon sits the administration with the other. Kansas City Times. "Prosperity" at Fall River. In the favored and much protected United States, within six months after the introduction of the Dingley duties, which represent the complete aud final system of protection, the wages of the 2S.000 Fall River cotton spinners are reduced 10 per cent., without notice and without concern for the consequences. As a lesson on the results of protection the deficit in the pockets of the Fall River cotton spinners is even more in structive than the deficit in the rev enue. New York World. Organ Predicts Defeat. The Republican party In Congress is at present divided on every important proposition upon which action is ex pected by the country. No recommen dation by the President is unanimously Indorsed. Does this argue a do-nothing session or only such results as carry with them the scars of bitter factional fighting? A do-nothing session of Con gress and demoralized Republican or ganizations in important States will Inevitably lead to defeat next year. Washington Star. As the Republican Reason. AVonderful is the logic of Republican ism. According to tills system the Wil son bill brought about si deficit of $70, 000,000 fourteen months before it was passed, and now it has brought about i deficit of $40,000,000 five months after It has been repealed. Memphis Com mercial Appeal. Only One Thing More Needed. The Illinois Republican leaders pro pose to gerrymander the State again in order to secure, if possible, a few more legislative and congressional seats. If they could only deprive the minority of representation absolutely they would rest content. Manchester, N. n., Un ion. Honest and Bogus Pensioners. In the process of purging the pension, rolls which has become so imperative there would be nothing to be feared by those who rightfully belong on the lists. IThe enormous amount which is now expended in pensions would be cheerfully paid by the people, without one word of complaint, If It were in discharge of an honest and patriotic obligation. No retrenchment is asked which interferes with the relief of any veteran who was disabled iu the ser vice and who needs the assistance ol the government. All that Is demanded Is the abandonment of a policy which encourages a ;rit of mendicancy and a disposition .., work the government Kansas City Star. Mr. Howell's Misapprehension. A statement is put forth by Assistant Secretary Howell of the Treasury De partment, apparently designed to miti gate the discouraging figures of his chief as regards the operation of the Dingley tariff. The point made by Mr. Howell is that the responsibility for the future of the Republican tariff to pro duce revenue lies with the public, not with the law. If we had the imports that we had in 1S92 or 1890, he says, it would be all right. But the purpose of the Dingley bill is to shut out im portations. If the people do not import as much under the Dingley law as they did under tho Democratic tariff, is not that, according to Republican logic, a great and glorious triumph of the pro tective principle? Boston Post. Speaker Recti Able to Dictate. The silence of Speaker Reed on all the material points of President lie Kinley's message is pregnant. Mr. Reed's mastery of the House promises to be as complete through the regular session as it was over the session called by the President before the most valu able part of the patronage had been dispensed. This being the case, he will be in a position to dictate terms to the administration on nearly every proposition affecting domestic as well as foreign affairs. St. Louis Republic. Inharmonious Republican Projects.? The Republicans talk one hour about their purpose to limit Immigration to the United States by shutting out the ignorant, vicious, pauper scum of southern Europe. The next hour they tell us they propose to take in, by treaty, or by an act of annexation, 100, 000 of the very dregs of hunimanity. The worst that come from Cicily, lowet Italy and Poland are model material compared to the riffraff of the Sand wich islands. Chattanooga Times. Kxcitinc Times in the House. The congressional grind has com menced, and it is quite exciting to see Speaker Reed as he places the nose of Congressman after Congressman to the grindstone and forces other alleged rep resentatives of the people to do the grinding. Louisville Post. Their Day of Revenge Coming. It is claimed that the administration is able to appoint but one out of every eighty who apply for office. For fur ther particulars concerning the seventy nine who arc disappointed see next year's congressional election returns. Washington Post. An Administration of Deficits. The biggest visible thing the McKin ley administration has developed is the deficit in the treasury, but that is noth ing compared to the deticit in the pock ets of the people through the protection afforded to trusts under the Dingley law. Louisville Dispatch. The President's Message. It is fortunate for the country that President McKinley's peculiar financia' views, as expressed in his message, stand no chance of being enacted into law. Knoxville Tribune. Late, but frankly, a Republican Pres ident acknowledges that tho Republi can financial legislation of the last thirty-five years is unsound, unsafe and ought to be reformed altogether. New York Times. The President closes a remarkably weak and meaningless message with u good word for the civil service laws, which his officials just now are so in dustriously engaged iu trying to evade. Wheeling Register. President McKinley's first message to Congress will hardly go into history as a great state paper. The message at no point, either in though, or in dic tion, rises to a height to make it note worthy. Des Moines Leader. The message on the whole is color less, and we Imagine it will be disap pointing to both the friends and the enemies of the administration. It say hardly enough to please the one or tc gratify the other. Detroit News. A collection of words, and not bril liairt ones at that. Of positive expres sion, of individuality, of pith and mar row there Is none. The message U hardly warm enough to melt a hole iu the snow on the Fourth of July. Quiu ey (111.) Herald. He has missed a golden opportunity for writing a great aud patriotic rues sage, and has given the country Instead a tedious discourse filled with excuse.' for inaction on some important sub jects, and making tentative and indefi nite recommendations with regard tc others. Buffalo Courier. The whole message is pitifully weak. Abstract where it should be concrete wavering where it should be steady and evasive where it should be frank cautious where it should be bold, anc disappointing where it should be in spiring. Minneapolis Times. That is a highly humorous paragraph in the President's message which would "make our ships familiar visitors at every commercial port of the world.' The object of the high tariff being tc restrict commerce, what use have we for ships Iu foreign ports? St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Mediocrity apologizing for bad raitli and incompetency epitomizes the quali ty of the President's message. Charac terized mildly, President McKinley s latest state paper is a tissue of unsound and vacillating policies tediously pre sented aud feebly defended. Kansas City Times. It is less remarkable in what it says than In what it omits to say. So far from showing aggressive qualities, it is conservative to the verge of the com monplace. Not even the stock market, alert to extract a sensation from any public event, reacts to anything the President has to say to Congress. Bos ton Post. President McKinley seems to hava entirely overlooked that $9,000,000 a month treasury deficit. Only nine months ago he insisted that an excess of expenditures over receipts was a dangerous condition, which must be stopped at once, if confidence and pros perity were to be restored. Indianapo lis News. In Xova Scotia gold mining no shafts have yet been sunk deeper than COO feet, but for t.ie purpose of learning what is on the 'ower levels a 1,000-foot shaft is to be sunk iu the Caribou district.
