S -sTAKING NOTICE. -Thei comparatively, greater gain in population which the west has shown during the past 'decade is, of course, acoo upted for' to some extent by the occupation of new lands. But some of q easter people are inclined to ettrdbute It to the energetic publicity Ribing wesitern commnunities have H ere, for instance, is the com Uliait 4f the Boasto Monitor upon this .asteriers who have not h' ad oc .-.ei. to scquaint themselves with d~at. A, who hay: n9t .had the l~e on them. would be ere tly called upon slid. btoi tte vastess of the_ r tid literatre In the *r~ a state, a city t ina tihe terrl ý pi and .M tat ,provided Iitipps not .-- ° ''nd ft wor bscha!te' club tof any w tity, ;will bring a large pack eof literature covering every point l ly to be of interest to the inquirer. And one in this way may be placed on the regular nmaling list and thus be the constant recipient Of circulars, m at: i;tndtitrial reports, etc., whice ire . tlreftliy compiled and of great value tor-immedlate use or for filing. In- general the literature issued for promotion purposes in the west, whether itt is intended to make known the natural resources of the country, to advertise its agricultural or indus trialýadvantages or to boom some spe Cial enterprise, is skillfully prepared, handsodhely illustrated and artistically printed. It Is the )ind of advertising matter that people take to their homes or their places of business and study and preserve for future reference. In a sense it is very costly literature for gatuitous distribution, but the west finds that it pays. It might be said that there are cities In the west which expend tens of thousands of dollars annually in this method of advertising alone., Not only i~ the literature itself kept up to a high Stardard, but the bureaus or ganised for its Judicious distribution are conducted by high-salaried men. At the present time San Francisco is issuing splendidly illustrated booklets and folders to promote its claims for the Panama' exposition, which are not only instructive as regards the city of the Golden Gate and the state of Cal ifornia, but are valuable as a study in western art development. New Or leans Is publishing a magazine for the same purpose. Nobody seems to have thought of it so far, but sometime those cities in other parts of the country that are yearning or planning for expansion may make, a collection of the promo tion literature of the west for exhibi tlon and inspiration purposes. 

CHINA. China, having cut off the queues of four hundred million of Its people, is now turning toward the building of a strong navy and the organising of angod a army. The queues went Is a concesslon to .the prejudice of other pationsq. that the Chinman -'might not be distingulahed .by the unusual per sonal adornment when away from home; the army and navy come as another evidence that China wishes to be of the world in reality, and no longer a land. sufficient unto itself. The possibilities of China awakened are vast. The little country of Japan, easily lost in the great territory of China, has accomplished wonders since it entered civilization. Given an equal opportunity, might not the uncounted millions of China embrace the creed of modernity and become a factor In the history of the next fifty or hun dred years? John Chinaman may yet make himself felt, once he is cured of the Rip Van Winkle habit. Of, course Christmas will be. merry; it always is; but you can make it merrier if you haye a thought for those who are less fortunate than yourself. Pretty soon It will be so late that you can't shop early. Then you'll push and struggle in the crowd and kick yourself because you didn't take good advice. The Butte police captain who pre vented a murder is a better officer than those who wait till a murder is commntted and then chase the slayer. The solution of the Crow-teserva tlon difflculty appears. to be satisfac tory to the Crows and they didn't have to dig up big attorney fees. However, the piece-by-piece re vision of the tariff will not be like the Dutchman's operation of cuttirg off his dog's tail an Inch at a time. The chamber of commerce election tonight should call out a large and interested crowd. The work for the coming year is important. Mr. Roosevelt is, according to the definition of New York, a radical; but he is the sort of radical we like. The pull-together may be given a tryout, after all, at this session of congress; the signs are encouraging. The doctrine of the square deal is not to be shelved by a single defeat; there will be another election. An advertisement in The Missoullan benefits the man who places it there and the man who reads it. Santa Claus is busier than usual in Missoula this season, which is a mighty good sign. The man who spends his time com plaining that he has no business will never have any. Missoulian advertisers tell you where and how to shop early and to good advantage. If you dont' believe there's a Santa Claus, just spend an hour walking about town. The early shopper gets the pick of the goods. MAYOR I8 ARRESTED. Plainsville, Ohio, Dec. 14.-The war between Mayor J. B. Burrows and Prosecutor E. F. Blakely over the presentation of the Passion play at a moving picture theater last Sundly resulted in the arrest of the mayor today on the charge of breaking the Sunday laws. SOCIALIST COUNCILMAN. Biloxi, Miss., Dec. 14.-The first socJalist elected in Mississippi and one of the few in the south, secured a ,victery in a municipal election here yesterday. S. W. Rose, running on a so.elist platform, was elected to the ity cotiniall over a democratic nom Steamboat Traftfic By Fr.edrio J. Haskin. The represeitstives of the steam boat lines which carry passengers on the waters of the 'United States are now in session In Washington. Th.y have a national association for the mutual promulgation of traffic rules and regulations, The rise of the rail road has brought with it the decline of the steamboat as a passenger car rler, but the steamboat men are hope ful that the crusade of the rivers and harbors congress will result in' the re turn of the steamboat to popular fa vor. When the canal from Chicago to the Mississippi is completed and the river is deepened to St. Louis the boats may find a profitable carrying business. Steam vessels otn the rivers of, the United States are gradually growing more numerous, but they are showing a decrease in total tonnage figures On the Mississippi river the number of steam vessels increased by nearly halt in the 17 years from 1889 to 1906, while at the same time their total tonnage, decreased by one-fourth. Gasoline power-+boats are included as steam vessels in this enumeration, which largely explains the surprise of these figures. When President Taft recommended in his message that a law should be enacted to prohibit any transcontt nental railroad from owning or being in any way interested in any vessel passing through the Panama" canal, he based this recommendafion on the fact that the railroads usually have found it good policy to dominate com peting steamboat lines so that the natural advantages of water trans portation could.not be used as a club to force down railroad rates. With the possible exception of the delta-draining Nile, no other river in the world's history has borne upon its water the commerce that was floated upon the Mississippi during the three decades of the middle of the last century. In 1850 there were few railroads west of the Alleghenies, but the wheat fields of Minnesota and the northwest were cormanding the attention of the whole `ountry. At the same time toe plantations of Loulslana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, with their acres of cotton and sugar cane, their cattle, liogs, po tatoes and other products, were the richest in the seuth. All this vast and fruitful territory from St. Paul to New Orleans poured its wealth into the coffers of the men who naviglted the steamboats from St. Louis to St. Paul on the upper Misslssippi and from St. Louis to New Orleans on the lower Mississippi, While the Missouri and the Ohio, the great right and left arm tributaries, brought coal from the Alleghenies and sent the pioneer on the first silage of his journey to ward the golden west with its, bo nanza promises of the newly discov ered mines in California. No period or place in American his tory has been fraught with more ro mance and adventure thati life.,on the Mississippi in' the ,fifties atd slities., It was an age of long chartces ,and large profits. Skeamnboats costing from $60,000 to $80,000, with hulls of per ishable !wooden , planks, with their flimsy superstructures literally soaked in oil paints, their boilers made of iron and their officers ever eager to "take a chance," were in constant peril of destruction from those four great foes of river traffic-snags, fire, explosions and collision. The average life of a river steamboat in the fifties was four years., Many of them went to the bottom--dr up in the clouds on their first trip. But their short tenure of life was more than offqet by the tremendous profits which they yielded to their owners and masters. It was not an unusual accomplish ment for a large, swift steamboat to clear 60 per cent net in one season and frequently this was exceeded. The traffic handled was enormous and the rates charged were proportionately large, the competition between lines not being of such a nature as to cut into the revenue. This was due to the fact that the shipyards could not turn out boats rapidly enough to-meet the growing demands of the shippers and passengers in a new and boomingsec tion of the fabulously rich river +ba sin. But the romance and adventure of steamboat life are not to be found in the account books of the packet com panies, Ibut rather among the passen gers who gave color and variety to every trip. The river gambler was not a mythical figure. He was one of the most picturesque characaers -of our early history. Few stories of the old south fail to mention the quave indi vidual who inveigles tle wealthy planter into a game of "cyards" when the latter is returning from St. Louis or the east, his belt laden with twenty-dollar gold pieces, the yield of his cotton sacks. And in most of these stories one finds the planter, stripped to his last penny, finally' staking his faithful body servant or his beautiful quadroon slave on the last hand at draw poker. The upper Mississippi had a class of gamblers all its own. Here the sharpers were accustomed to work in pairs. The two seldom boarded the steamboat at the same time nor did they ever recognize each other. They became acquainted with their victims individually and were then introduced to each other by the deluded settler on his way to the wheat fields of Minnesota with the savings .q a life time in the east. The gamblers of the fifties were tolerated by the steam boat owners because they were con stant travelers, and promoted thebar business of the boat, although they themselves kept .their own private bottles of colored water to be served by the saloonkeeper instead of rum which would have shaken their nerve and thus destroyed their "business" perspicacity. .teamboat racing gave variety and spice to the life on the Mississippi. Oneo0f the most thrilling contests was that between the Grey Eagle and the Itasca 9jý the upper Mississippi. This race Is intimately connected with in ter.itional achievement, as the fol Jo.wlu Zrot show. In U1sB the frt cablegram across the Atlantip bore greetipgs from :,Quee V victoia to President Buchanan,; fo was at the time in St. Paul: Thete was no tele graph line to the 'linnesota metrop olis in that day, but there were lines to Dunlelth, where the Grey Eagle was loading for St. Paul, and at Pral rie du Chien, where the Itasca was about to cast off. Both boats were due to leave at 6 o'clock. They Grey Eagle was 61 miles further from St.. Paui' than the Ztayca. but (aiitPin Harris determined to be the first" to deliver the message to the presideft. He mate only one or two landings during this record run. He pitched his mail bags to the wharves without do ing more than slowing down. As he was running far ahead of his sched ule the mail bags for points up the river were not ready, so he did not have to stop to' take these on. The Itasca was 'proceeding leisurely on its way, unconscious of the efforts of its rival, until the latter was seen to turn a bend in the river only a short dis tance behind. Then the Itasca realised that the Grey Eagle meant to capture the honor of being the first to de liver the mesasge to the president. Then it was a race for life for the few remaining miles to St. Paul, the Grey Eagle winning by a bare length. A broom nailed to the pilot house was a symbol of sped supremacy in the old days, and-'a champion, once passed, was in honor bound to take down its sweeper until such time as it could beat its rival. In these races the captain frequently saved bairels of pitch and resin to be fed into the furnaces on the last stretch in order to develop a final burst of speed from the engines. It was often necessary to station men on the upper decks with fire hose to play water upon the smokestacks where they passed between decks, to prevent the sur rounding woodworkl froim Ignitink.. On the lower Mississippi cases of ham and bacon were sometimes burned in the frenzy 6f the moment. One of the most pleasurable phases of a passenger's trip was the cabin music furnished. 'There was great riv alry between the, competing lines in this particular, as well as in speed. A string orchestra was highly prized, and it soon became. known which boats had the best dance music and which gave the best concerts.' One of the tipper Mississippi steamers in stalled a calliope and for a brief p0 rld its popularity was exdeptional, but after a while it was discovered that passengers did not` relish more than one trip onlatboat which Ioasted this shrieking siren, and they. were abandoned. On the lower Mississippi 'the singing deck hands were an in stitution. Sometimes. negro chorilses possessed voices. of rare beauty and strength, and as they chanted the plantation hymns on deck at night, in the light of the flaring fire baskets, there w4 a mysterious charm about the pbrton ance which to this day brings bac' leasant memeories to the men of: three6 core and ten. Many are stori.' of~ heroismt and of cowardice in mroents of 'stress when river steamers, laden with sleeping passengers, would strike" snags, or burst suddenly into flame, or come in volglsiou with other packets on a dark ahnd foggy night. These are all a part of the romance of rivers which is rapidly becoming ploheer history. The passenger lines of todlay are infinitely safer, quicker aitil' mote comfortable than in the ante-bellum and ante railroad days, but'the glamor, the picturesqueness and the subtle fasci nation of. uncertainty are gone for ever. Tomorrow-The game of chess.

The cornerstone for the chapter house to be erected by the American ~itgfas vague at Deer Lodge has rbeoan la And the building is under conteruction. This is the same under taking that is occupying the attention of some Mlss6ula women, whose rahns have progressed in a very satisfactory manner. Of the ceremonies at the cornerstone-laying at Deer Lodge, the Silver State says: "The opening number on the pro gram,was the singing of 'America' by all Iiresent.' . "Dr. H. -t. Fancher, president of the College of Montana, gave a most in teresting address, telling of the his tory of the organization in Deer Lodge -of how one year ago Mrs. W. H. Whitehill of Avon had introduced the plan of the league to Mrs. W. I. Hig gins, who, though greatly opposed, had, by persistent effort and with the aid of a few faithful workers, secured the required numnber of membe's for a $4.500 chapter house. Dr. Fancher spoke of the educational advantage the league offered, especially ' along art lines of the pleasure the ladies would have in meeting in their own building, and of the benefit the town would derive in having ra\new and [beautiful building, with fine grounds; an example of good architecture and landscape gardening. Dr. FPncher spoke of the generous donations which had been made to the Deer Lodge chapter. Praise was given C. D. Ter rett for two lots donated; W. C. 'Spottswood for $52 to help organize, and to Albert Ayotte for the fine cornerstone with 1910 engraved upon it. Mr. Barnden also donated the Mc Burney house for a reception and sup per. "It was then the privilege of the officers of the league to place various articles in the tin box,. which the president had charge of: Constitution and by-laws, by Mrs. S. S. Koehler, first vice president; the Silver State and Powell County post, by Mrs. R. Lee Kelley, third vice president; Wo man's National Daily (N6vember 19 issue), by Mrs. William -Williams, member of the executive board; mem bership list (91 names), by Mrs. J. A. Grant, secretary; penny collection from each member, by Mrs. C. A. Childs, treasurer, and the American flag, by Mrs. W. I. Higgins, the presi dent. "As Mrs. Higgins placed the flag in the box, she said: 'It seems appro priate to place in this box the Ameri can flag, which is emblematic of loy alty and patriotism. As members of the American Woman's league let us be loyal to oulr cause; and to show our patriotism let us try to make our country better and more beautiful than we found it.' "While the masons put the corner stone and the president laid the tin box in it, the Deer Lodge hand played several patriotic airs. '9Rev. W. J. Attwood pronounced the benediction."
