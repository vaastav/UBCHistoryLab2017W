Hut the ugly ; hunk act adequate instrumentalities and Incredible thing has actually come about, and we are without adequate ederal laws to deal with it. I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I aro urging you to do nothing less than save the honor and self respect of th: nation. Such creatures of pas sion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out They are not many, but they are Infinitely malignant, and the hand of our jK)wer should close over them at once. They have formed plots to destroy property, they have entered Into conspiracies against the neutrality of the government, they have sought to pry Into every confidential trans action of the government in order to Ferro Interests alien to our own. It Is possible to deal wltj these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms In which they may be dealt with. I wish that It could le said that only a few men, misled by mistaken senti ments of allegiance to the governments i under which they were born, had been j guilty of disturbing the self possession I and misrepresenting the temper and principles of the country during these days of terrible war, when it would , com that every man who was truly an j American would Instinctively make It I by which long credit may be obtained on land mortgages and that we should study more carefully than they have hitherto been studied the right adapta tion of our economic arrangements to changing conditions. Muny conditions about which we have repeatedly legislated are being altered from decade to decade, it is evident, under our ver, eyes and are likely to change even more rapidly and more radically in the days Imme diately ahead of us when ieace has returned to the world and the nations of IIurorH once more take up their tasks of commerce and industry with ;he energy of those who raut bestir themselves to build anew. Just what these changes will be no one can cer tainly foresee or confidently predict There are no calculable, lecause no stable, elements in the problem. The most we enn do Is to make certain that we have the necessary instrumen talities of Information constantly at our service so that we may be sure that we know exactly what we are dealing with when we come to act, if It should be necessary to act at all. We must first certainly know what It Is thnt we are seeking to adapt our selves to. I may ask the privilege of addressing you more at lenrth on this IT PAYS TO AUVKHTISir' Wiseacre who decry the use of printer's Ink ax a medium of public ity are advised to j?o and se "It Pays to Advertise." Cohan and Har ris' latest play suecVs, which is to be presented at th Oliver theater this evening- and tomorrow matinee and night. "It Pays to Advertise" Is a farce that was the reigning langh in ff hit at the (Jeorge M. Cohan the ater in New York all last season. It was written by Hoi Cooper Merue, author of "Under Cover," and Walter Hackett. This Ingenious comedy will. It is said, do more to boost the advertis ing business than any argument the smartest of advertising men could think of. Indeed, this show con tains about the best arguments that a convention full of promoters could think up in a month. Moreover, it is full of laughs and, what is more to the point, iris clean. The story told in "It Pays to Ad vertise" concerns an Idle youth whose father, a captain of industry, casts him a.side. He falls in with a young man who Is full of ideas, the princi pal one being publicity. "Say a thing often enough and hard enough," says this yountf promoter, "and the man you are trying to convince will not only fall for your argument, but will shortly believe that he himself is the originator of it." The disowned son and his pal de vise a scheme to boom a new brand of wonder soap and by means of an extraordinary advertising campaign build up a tremendous business. Put, unfortunately, they have no soap. Father, astounded at his son's com mercial coup, comes to the rescue and all Is well, but not before count less complications, sentimental and otherwise, have transpired. It would be a misfortune not to see "It Pays to Advertise." It will give you the laughing treatment, which everybody needs and everyone is bet ter for having, but It does more, much more than that. It booms busi ness, it Imparts the best business spirit not the narrow, timid, cring ing spirit of small business, but the spirit bir, audacious, large-vision-ed, which commands success. ences. She finally brines herself up to his standard, and then tells him j what she had done, thus causing a ; violent scene. His old girl tries to win him back, hoping that he will seek a divorce, but, in a thrilling scene of dantrer and disaster the wife proves herself the better woman, and her sacrifice wins her husband's love and forgiveness. The drama is worked out to It.s conclusion in a manner which capti vates the minds and hearts of those who see it. and leaves a comfortable feelin of satisfaction over the fact I that a Kirl. starting life under a heavy handicap, has proven herself worthy of the hlchest place in the affections of an educated, high-bred man. A Vim comedy entitled "A Pair of Pirds" is also to be shown. On to morrow's bill are "The Tenderfoot's Triumph," a Selig western comedy, and "The House of Tear," a detec tive story, with Arnold Daly in the leading role. ski.xi:k ix nhv oomi:iy itou: Otis Skinner, who returns here on next Thursday night. Dec. 9, it the Oliver opera house for one time in 'Cock o the Walk," a new comedy by Henry Arthur Jones, has a most congenial role. Every now and then the hardened playgoer comes across a character study so perfect In de tail and so convincing in effort that one is bound to confess that acting Is after all one of the arts. In the new comedy from the brilliant pen of Henry Arthur Jones, Mr. Skinner has a hih comedy part that ought to test the powers of any true com edian. "Anthony Pellchamber," a Rifted but unsuccessful actor, is a perfect tornado of humor, wit and good nature. He is the living em bodiment of the "actor tempera ment." His reverence for "The Im mortal One," as he always terms Shakespeare, is prodigious. His fac ulty for quoting from the works of the Hard of Avon and answering the most commonplace and colloquial questions in Shakespearean language Js nothing short of marvelous. He Is, in the fullest extent of the word, "professional." Put he has. added to his eccentricity of manner, a re finement that is almost typically aristocratic and not at all charac teristic of many of the "good fel lows" of the theatrical fraternity, who carry conviviality to an excess. members of the troupe. The open ing number by Mine. Asoria and two assistants is a scries of classic terp sichorean whirls, seldom equalled cn local vaudeville tills. Pice and I'rancis follow with a talking act. AT THE STII.WP. The musical comedy company at the Strand is presenting a farce, "Thompson's Demise." Parry Hyatt plays the leading comedy role, that of a darky servant who has some trying experiences with ghosts. The plot is frequently interrupted by en tertaining musical specialties, which Include -Tilly Iee," sung by P.ob Shaw; "You Will Have to jSwim Pack to the Shore." by Mabelle Eil er; "Celebration Day in Tennessee," I y Mamie Hertzell; "Don't Pe Angry Mary," by Edna I.eNore; and "Dear Little Girl." by Eunny Whitlock. AT Till' COIiOMAIi. "Satan Sanderson," as a novel, sold' well into the million copies. Later as a play, it attained a long rrn on Proadway, and then en joyed great vogue on tour. Now, in its new form, a live part picture, it bids fair to outdo either of the others. "Satan Sanderson" is made in 2 00 scenes, requires a cast of 4 0 players, and over $ 40,000 was spent on the production. THE McMAHILL CO. IYrruerIy Montgomery's 321 S. MICIIKiAX ST.

The transportation prob lem U nn exceedingly serious and preslns; the even thrper humiliation nnd scorn which every self possessed nnd thru cht fully patriotic American must feel when he think of thera and of the discredit they are daily brlnin upon us. NATURAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE CONSERVED. Further Rural C.-edits Advisable. Transportation a Problem. While we hpeak of the preparation of the nation to make sure of her securi ty aiul her effective power we mut J not fall info the patent error of sup-j posln that her real strength conns from armament? nnd mere safeguards , of written law. It comes, of cuiir-e. from her inople, their energy, thoir has from time to time of late been rea son to fear that our railroads would not much longer he able to cope with :t successfully, as at present equipped .md co-ordinated. I Fupcrest that It would be wise to provide for a com mission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of the whole ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered nre ns serv iceable ns they miht be in the solu tion of the problem. It is obviously a problem that lies nt the very foun dation of our efficiency an a people. Such an Inquiry ou;rht to draw cut every circumstance nrd opinion worth considering, and we need to knov all sides of the matter if we mean to do anythimr ln the field of federal leg islation. No one. I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The regula tion of the railways of the country by federal jtnmission has had admirable results niul has fully justified the hopes and expectations of those by at thi: ls.uj:. Today's feature at the LaSalle is Marguerite Clark, one of the most charinin.tr of the present fdm fa orites. The play is entitled 'Still Waters," and Introduces this "girl that is different" in a novel screen drama of circus life. The excellence of this production has heen univers ally commented upon by the metro politan prets and the slightly ad vanced prices the LaSalle today will bo found to he justifiable. Wednesday's feature 1h a William Fox production, "The Broken Law," featuring William Fa mum and Dor othy Bernard in a stirrlnff story of flypsy life. The plot concerns the search for a mlssin child, her ter riblo experiences, and the keeping of an oath of vengeance. Mr. Far num will be remembered for his excellent work in "The Spoilers" and .ther hlg pictures, Is capably as sisted by Dorothy Bernard, hand some and attractive screen star. "Tin: divii' xmix;. On next Friday nik'ht, Dec. 10. the Oliver Stock company will ajjain take up a run of two bills a week at the Oliver theater. The openinpr play will be the much-heralded drama. "The Devil." Thi has boon a wonderful success in stock, owlntf to its unusually strong story and the many interesting parts. Mr. Finch will be seen as Dr. Millar, "The Devil," a part that is entirely dif ferent from any he has played here. Miss Aubrey will appear as Mrs. Hoffman, the wife of the millionaire. "The Devil" is a sreat play. There are surprises and suspense In the arrangement and the story has just enough sensationalism to brintj the play the popularity It deserves. "Kick In," a new crook play, will be the stock offering for the first half of week starting Sunday, Dec. 12. The LaSalle is planning an extra photodrama program for next Tues day when the splendid allegorical picture, "The Miracle of Life," will be brought back and shown In con nection with a feature society drama entitled 'The Mummy and the Hum mingbird." A total of 10 reels will be given with a feature picture start ing on the even hour, throughout the day and evening. Prices will be ad anccd for this engagement. Again Tomorrow Night.
