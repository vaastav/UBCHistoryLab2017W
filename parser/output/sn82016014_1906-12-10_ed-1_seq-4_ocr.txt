The State Journal Is a member of the Associated Press and receives the full day telegraph report ot that treat ri or ranlnation for the exclusive afternoon publication In Topeka. The news is received tn The Stnts .Tonr nal buildirs over wires for this aoie pur roee. If Japan does conclude to box our cars It will be rather difficult for her to float war bonds in Russia. Up to date that Intention to haze Senator La Follette appears to have been delayed in transmission. Somebody has counted the words In the president's message and has dis covered there are 35.000 of them. The Shah of Persia Is dead or dying. There are going to be a lot of widows over In Persia one of these days. Count Boni Is writing; for a Paris newspaper. Why did the Hearst papers overlook an opportunity of this kind? It is suggested in London that the names of the days of the week be changed. All right. Which one shall we name after Roosevelt? The harassing of Roosevelt by "the interests" has already commenced, but "the interests" are a little leery about beginning the hazing of LaFollette. Three officials who had a hand in wrecking the Milwaukee Avenue bank In Chicago have been sent to prison. Chicago does some things right, any way. The Japanese say they like the pres ident's message, but have they really read It? Just think how the entire message would look printed in Japa nese. Incidentally it is doubtful if any mes sage ever written by any president ever provoked so much discussion as the one that Theodore Roosevelt has Just pro mulgated. The Louisville Courier-Journal says the latest airship is "190 feet long and resembles a Kansas ear of corn." Some thing like a Kansas "nubbin," suggests Fred Trigg. Congress has been in session a week and the chief business the United States senate has transacted thus far has been to direct two slaps In the president's direction. Speaking of the banquet which To peka held to celebrate her birthday, Leavenworth intimates that it was an "orgy," but leaves it to Wichita to make the direct charge. If Mr. Ledbetter, who poses as a con stitutional lawyer in the Oklahoma Constitutional convention, thinks the United States constitution is not the supreme law of the land, Mr. Ledbetter learn a few things. The Leavenworth Times concedes that it costs more to live these days than formerly, but it says it is worth the price. And that, too, in face of the prospect that the saloons may be closed In Leavenworth. Another reason why Mr. Roosevelt did not include his remarks concerning the canal in his message last week is because he considers it a very im portant subject and worthy of a whole chapter by itself. Judge Peters of Newton, positively refuses to vote for the confirmation of James Rudolph Garfield as secretary of the interior. And Judge Peters was not In the Kansas state senate when it demanded that the president fire Mr. Garfield. Hereafter if you do not wish to be asked to contribute to a campaign, just incorporate yourself. Mr. Roosevelt proposes to make it unlawful for a corporation to contribute, but while you remain a private Individual you can dig up all the campaign money you want to. Since too much prosperity has caused the car famine, the Parsons Sun sug gests that Mr. Bryan's prophecy of the coming of "woe, want and misery" has been fulfilled. It sure has. The grain shipper is filled with woe, the cattle man wants some cars, and there is misery because of a lack of coal. There are some murmurlngs among the grandstanders against increasing the salaries of the supreme court Jus tices, but it is not of a nature that ought to have any influence. Among the others who ought to have a square deal this winter are those who work for the state at a financial sacrifice. The new football rules do not amount to much, in the opinion of T. A. Cordry, because only two men less were killed this season than last. Still, If Mr. Cordry were one of the two men whose lives were saved by the new rules he might think the new rules amount to considerable. It all depends on the point of view. The Newton Kansan strenuously ob lects to the appointment of Attorney General Moody on the United States supreme bench because Massachusetts already has a supreme judge. But Is there really any law prohibiting: one state from having; two Judges? The people of this country are more inter ested in whether Mr. Moody will make a good judge than they are in what state he comes from. THE 

JOINT IX TOPEKA. The good people of this city heard a few plain truths yesterday. Repre sentatives of the State Temperance un ion say that the violation of law in To peka is a greater obstacle to its en forcement in other parts of the state than are similar or worse condition" elsewhere, because Topeka is the capital of the state, the official home of the state's executive officers. Topeka people do not deny that the law is violated here; but because we do not license such violation we have fancied that Topeka is better than such wicked places as Leavenworth and Wichita. Topeka, as a municipality refuses to participate in the evil profits of vice, and will not countenance the trampling under foot of the law and the constitution on every street corner. Yet this very virtue seems to be our weakness. Periodically, when the law breaker becomes too bold, we rise and drive him forth -for a time. Then" he opens "clubs" and illicit resorts in hid den placesupstairs rooms behind bolts and guards. The good citizen of Topeka hears rumors of these things. but because he does not see them and does not hunt them out, he fancies they do not amount to much. Ex-Senator Codding, attorney for the State Temperance Union, says these "clubs" and dives are worse than the open saloons of Leavenworth and Wichita! In the latter places, says Senator Codding, gambling rooms and houses of ill repute are separate from the saloons, but in these Topeka joints I gamblers, courtesans and libertines mingle freely with young boys who are drawn into the joints. The citizen of Junction City, or Leavenworth, or Atchison, who is ac customed to drinking in a well-appointed saloon, comes to Topeka- He wants 'a drink, of course, and instead of finding it in an open saloon he finds his way into one of these joints. Then he. goes home and reports that condi tions in ToDeka, the capital of the state, are wore than In his own town. This condition certainly ought not to bo, and Topeka owes it to herself to see that it exists no longer. The criminal who operates such a place as the one described is just as bad as the tbief who sneaks into a house and steals the silverware. In fact, the re sult of his crime is worse than that of the thief, for he ruins homes and steals manhood, while the thief steals only a few paltry trinkets. The joint has been driven out of other Kansas cities: what does Topeka propose to do about it? THE PRESIDENT AT PAXAMA. It is interesting to note how Presi dent Roosevelt inspected conditions at Panama, as related by recent weekly magazines. There was nothing formal about his investigations. He plunged about, here and there, asking questions and finding out thing3 for himself. Here are some of the incidents of his inspection, as told in the current num ber of Harper's Weekly: Instead of going up to the new rail road station where prancing horses were held ready to draw him to the new and luxurious Hotel Tivoli for luncheon, the president led the way to the government mess-hall at La Boca. Forty engineers, steam-shovel men and mechanics had just finished their breakfast, as the midday meal is call ed in Spanish-American countries, and although they knew in a moment who their visitor was, they did not stare at him overmuch, but in silence politely filed out of the room. Mr. Walsh, manager of the mess, ta ken by surprise, was anxious to have a fresh cloth laid. "Not at all," said Mr. Roosevelt. "Let's get the crumbs off and go ahead." Side-stepping the "Panama Cocktail." While the waiter was making ready Mr. Stevens handed to the president the bottle of quinine and brandy local ly known as "Panama cocktail," and invited him to try some. It is a cus tom held In high repute on the is thmus to take this mixture before meals; but Mr. Roosevelt shook his head and smiled and took a three grain quinine pill instead. The breakfast came on briskly. There were excellent vermicelli soup, good bread and butter, broiled ham, canned peas, canned kidney-beans, fried sweet potatoes, boiled parsnips, jelly cake, ice cream, coffee, and cocoa. "Good as any one could wish." was Mr. Roosevelt's judgment after he had taken liberally from every dish. He went through the kitchen and found It clean and wonder of wonders in the tropics! without a single fly in sight. Every door and window was screened with fine wire mesh that keeps out all lnpects, no matter how small. All waste stuff is burned or dumped far out at sea. Every house and every bit of ground at La Boca Is as clean as the houses and the grounds along River side Drive. Not one drop of water is allowed to lie stagnant anywhere. Within an hour after the heaviest rain fall j ou will not find, either at La Boca or any other rart of the canal zone, a puddle as big as a mule's hoof-print. Incidentally it may be remarked that not one mosquito as visible anywhere In the zone. At Rio Grande the president sprint ed off through the rain and mud to see the quarters of the Jamaica negro laborers. He walks with quick, short, jerky steps as if he intended only to spurt for a few rods. But he kept up the pace indefinitely, and all of us who went with him were soon puffing. The laborers' houses are of wood, perched high on stone piers that keep them safely dry above the mud of the rainy season. The doors and windows are screened and mosqulto-proof, even though Colonel Gorgas has extermi nated all the mosquitoes. The canvas cots and the rooms were clean and neat. Next we visited a cooking-shed near at hand. There were Just four posts holding up a roof, and sitting on the red earth floor, now a squashy quagmire, were a few bricks on which were perched little charcoal-stoves. "Mr. Letta," said the president, "please take this down: cook-shed, iron roof, good; floor, a swamp." "We are going to have a concrete floor." explained Jackson Smith, su perintendent of labor and quarters. "When? Why not now?" the presi dont shot at him. Mr. Smith said no more, but seemed wrapped in deep thought. At the Hotel Tivoli that night the president heard complaints from com mittees of the mechanics, trainmen. and clerks. Most of these related to." the distribution and prices of food. Every one was enthusiastic about health conditions alon the canal. There has not been one death from disease among the 12,000 white canal folk in the last three months. As one result of the complaints Mr. Roosevelt stopped the train next morning at New Empire, and went straight to the quarters of the bach elor clerks, where he found the sani tary equipment in shocking condition. Three messengers were sent flying for the local sanitary inspector, and that man may thank his lucky stars that the runners could not find him. "I ask you, sir," the president said to Colonel Gorgas, "to have this con dition abated, at once, and to send me forthwith at Washington a report de tailing exactly what has been done and exactly the condition in which these quarters are stablished." It's a pretty safe guess that the president knows ai about conditions at Panama. 

JOURNAL ENTRIES Leavenworth is wearing its lid, but it is wearing; it tilted over one ear. You know what that indicates. Now that the president has simpli fied spelling, if he will also simplify arithmetic he will confer a great favor on the women who keep household accounts. While the message was highlv inter esting, of course, this department Is not holding its breath while waiting for the next installment, which will tell the story of the canal. A man has been indicted for bribery in Pittsburg. The rest of the country will be surprised to learn that Pitts burg considers bribery a crime. 

JAYHAWKER JOTS Prosperity has struck the Chase Register to the extent of a new press. A Muscotah farmer got 212 gallons of cider out of a single wagon load of apples. How's that for juiciness? A Highland woman made $15 in one month from one cow. Besides supply ing a family of seven, she sold milk to 15 customers. It takes considerable to dampen the enthusiasm of the baseball crank. Out at Pawnee Reck a ball game was re cently played in a snow storm. There is a widespread demand, says Morton Albaugh, for another edition of XX- Y. Morgan's book of travels. And, adds Mr. Albaugh, every candi date for United States senator will be supposed to buy one. Deacon Walker: We have a brother in our church who belonged to several other denominations before he came to us, and he tells us they have the s?.me trouble everywhere: Impossible to get a $2,000 preacher for $750 a year. A Hiawatha landlady is certainly a wonder, if what the World says is cor rect. She has 17 boarders and each and every one praises her table. She does all the cooking by herself washes the dishes does all the work hires no help. And she finds time to attend church regularly and enjoy lec ture course entertainments and all other events of worth and interest. A year as;o a wreck occurred on the Santa Fe near Lang, Kan., and two pigs in the express car escaped. Wells Fargo offered a reward for them and one was returned. Another was found lr. the possession of a farmer, who claimed he had bought it on the etreets of Emporia for $3.50. Suit was brought, the express company recov ered judgment against L. D. Water man for it, and costs amounted to about $350. "And it was a red pig at that," says the Wichita Eagle. Atchison Globe: Some time ago Mrs. D. N. Wheeler bought forty pig eons, intending to raise squabs. Since buying the birds, not a single egg has been laid. Investigation by an expert reveals that every bird is a rooster. Mrs. Wheeler's friends are greatly amused, and they are inducing people all over the east to write to her for squabs. Among- others, the manager of the Waldorf-Astoria, in New York, wrote her, saying he would take all her squabs, and sending her a stencil plate with which to mark shipments. Sabetha Herald: Bret Hanson has just recovered from a siege with the postoffice department regarding a shortage against him which occurred during the time Hanson was postmas ter at Price. When the postoffice at Price was discontinued last August Hanson closed up his affairs and sent in his report. Afterward the postoffice department made a discovery that Hanson was short one cent in his ac counts. Then the ponderous wheels of governmental machinery began to re volve. Slowly but surely the great cogs moved and made work for clerks. Th, clerks must have found that shortage a serious problem, for it took them three months to get it in such shape that they could make a demand on Hanson for the penny. Last week the demand came in the form of a draft on Hanson for one cent. POrXTEIJ PAItAGlUI'HS. From the Chicago News. A pretty girl usually has plain sailing. It isn't always the winner who wears a winning smile. "Critic" is the term a chronic kicker applies to himself. One Isn't necessarily crooked because he follows his natural bent. If It is necessary for you to make enemies make them of lazy men. If a man can afford a motor boat he he doesn't have to paddle his own canoe. Love may be a great leveler, but It takes marriage to flatten a man's poek etbook. You would never realize how empty some men's heads are if it wasn't for their tongues. A little learning is a dangerous thing, and too much often unfits a man for making an honest living. When a widow makes up her mind that she has lived alone long enough she gets busy and makes up her face. A man may be able to fool all the women some of the time, but there are some women who can fool a man all of the time. REFLECTIOXS OF A BACHELOR. From the New Tork Press.l It's awful unlucky to kiss a girl on the sly when her father is looking. It gives a man standing to have a pocketbook, even if there is nothing in it. When a man's daughter is engaged he can't go into the parlor even to hunt for an old pipe. It's mighty inconsistent for men to blame women for not understanding politics when nobody does. Even if you only knew one way, a wo man expects you to tell her you love her forty thousand different ways. Hardly anybody Is so sure of heaven that he starts for there with the same enthusiasm he has for going fishing. KANSAS COMMENT FORGIVING -STCIBBS. It is announced that Walter Roscoe Stubbs will introduce an anti-pass two-cent-fare bill at the coming ses slon of the legislature. It will be re membered that it was very largely through the influence of Speaker htubbs that the bill was sidetracked last session, but this will be forgiven If he gets through the kind of a bill the people want and need. The peo ple want legislation that will keep the railroads entirely out of politics. They can then hope to do something to wards equalizing rates and not until then. Tho people do not complain be cause the railroads make money, but of the unfair way in, which they dis criminate against the small shippers in favor of the larger ones, thereby eliminating competition. The anti pass measure is the first step to be taken, and the measure should be suf flciently stringent and easy of enforce ment that It will serve the purpose ex pected of it, and not be a dead letter on the statutes, as are most laws in tended to remedy railroad conditions, The railroad idea of law seems to be that if it is for the railroad it should be enforced, and if against it should be ig- norea. osago Chronicle.

It would seem to the aver age man that old Jeff had enough to rest under without this late serious charge. Hcltcn Recorder. MENTAL RESERVATION. The Wichita Eagle calls attention to the fact that when Ben Tillman took an oath as a Lnlted States senator to support the constitution, he probably made a mental reservation as to the fifteenth amendment. Probably the same as Mayor Ross Findley, of Wich ita, made a mental reservation of the prohibition amendment when he took an oath an mayor at W ichita to support the constitution of the state of Kan sas. Parsons Sun, BROKEN TIME-TABLES. The tragic death of Samuel Spencer, president of the Southern railway, in the wreck of Thursday morning, should serve as a terrible warning to the of ficials of his and other Southern rail roads. That the country has lost one of its sanest and most hard-working railway executives everyone will con cede. Mr. Spencer rose from the ranks because of his industry and his ability to think clearly on railway questions. He was able, moreover, to look far into the future, and was one of the first to recognize the south's industrial possibilities. Yet the comparative suddenness with which its prosperity came really swamped his railroad, as it has many others. Not even his prac tical experience could insure a well run railroad. Whether this was be cause of his own limitations, or be cause he was more absorbed in ques tions of policy and finance, this is not the time to consider. The tragic fact remains that his own lamentable death was caused by one of those need iest and Inexcusable accidents about which the southern sress has of late been complaining with deep feeling. Moie than that, the constant delays on the southern railroads have be come so grave a menace to t- j orderly conduct of business, and therefore the pros-perity of the south, that in Georgia a svErtematic campaign of criticism has been carried on for months past, with tho management of Mr. Spencer's rail way particularly under fire. It Is sig nificant to observe, therefore, that Mr. Spencer's death would not have oc curred if both the trains wrecked had not been hours behind their schedule. As now explained, the fault lay with tha operator of a block signal station, but that not much reliance was placer! upon the block operators appears from the fact that a brakeman was hastily sent back to flag the oncoming train. Moreover, if a railway persistently breaks its own rules, if its schedules are in a state of chronic demoraliza tion, its own employes are little to be blamed if they become lax in their own duties. New York Evening Post. 

EXEMPLAR OF CIVIC HONOR. Tax dodging New York, which in cludes the wealthy part of it pretty comprehensively, will be greatly shocked and disgusted over the action of ex-Mayor Seth Low. in paying over to the city treasury $27,397 in back taxes. The act Is entirely voluntary on Dr. Low's part, and that is what will make It so inexplicable to the high financiers and others who even go so far as to maintain more or less unreal residences out of the city in order to dodge tax claims. The wealthy ex mayor finds that he had been deduct ing a certain mortgage on property be longing to him which he has since learned could not legally be deducted. It is a fine exhibition of civic spirit which he shows, and is made where it la most needed. Springfield Republi can. BELATED PRECAUTION. Further testimony concerning the land operations out west suggests that if there is any public land left it should be locked up during the night time. Pittsburg Dispatch. NOT NECESSARILY.

J. XV. Foley in New York Times. A Woman Who Heads Expeditions. In her account of her mountain-climbing in the Andes Miss AnnfcvPeck nar rates some dramatic incidents and nar row escapes in climbing Mount Huas caran: "Our progress was slow as the way was steeper and more difficult. Sud denly, in crossing a gully, our leader slipped and slid rapidly down as far as the rope allowed, dropping his ice-axe by the way instead of uBlng it to stop himself; bo it depended solely on me. Luckily I now had on climbing-irons and was holding the rope tight. When tne pun came, much to my delight, it was not so strong as I expected, and I had no difficulty in retaining my posi tion and stopping his downward career. K. readily regained his feet and his Ice axe, and we continued on our way. Again X. refused to proceed with the rope or to carry the camera. I called him a coward, and all I could in Span ish, to no avail. 'He did not propose to be killed, if we were: he would hold the rope in his hand.' Yes, and drop it if we both slipped. No indeed, said I. It was all or none. I took the camera, coiled up the extra rope, and went on with E. alone. Presently I perceived X. fol lowing. He overtook us, half apologized for his conduct, said he would take the camera and put on the rope, but what would I give him? I considered the twenty soles promised far more than he deserved, but at length agreed to give thirty if we reached the big rock. It semed near, but with the necessary windings and our delays, at half past one it might take another hour to ar rive. Fearing that the Indians would depart, leaving the tents, etc., on the snow, if we did not return by three, I re luctantly gave the word to halt. Making tlio Ohio Xavlgable. The Ohio river will be made navi gable even if it takes 68 dams and locks to do it, said the U. S. govern ment. - That was about, a generation ago, and much higgling by the differ ent sections of the country affected by the suggested improvements has re sulted in seriously hampering the pur pose of congress, according to J. R. Schmidt, who tells about "Making the Ohio Navigable" in the Technical World Magazine for December. But the appropriation by congress of over a million dollars for the construction of one dam alone, the Fernbank dam near Cincinnati, finally gave definite shape to the work of making the river navigable for 1,500 miles. The work on this dam is about half-done, and five other dams are partially complet ed. The importance and national character of this work may be bet ter understood when it is known that Pittsburg coal shipped down the Ohio last year was destined for Japan, to be used by tho Mikado's fleet in its fight against Russia. The Ohio is the natural highway of commerce from the east to the middle west, but has heretofore been navigable for only four months in the year. When the Fern bank dam is completed, the river will bo navigable as far down as Cincin nati all the year round. With the im proved river it is estimated that the cost of transportation will be reduced about one-half. When Nesbit Read Hia Poem. Wilbur Nesbit, whose first novel, "The Gentleman Ragman," has just been pub lished, once read a poem ar a public din ner at the University of Chicago. It was the first time he had tried to read in public, and it is probable that he will never forget the occasion. The late President Harper was present, and with others of the faculty stTt at the speaker's table. Dr. Harper, who was beside Nes bit, observed that the young man was extremely nervous over his little part in the programme. So he spoke reassur ingly to him; told him to keep his nerve and do his best; that tle crowd was iriendly to him and that everybody wanted to hear him. Nevertheless, in spite of all this, when Nesbit arose, he had one of the choicest examples of stage fright ever seen. His throat was so dry that he could barely speak for the moment. ITis lips twitched nervously and his hands quivered. He was not taking any chances with his memory, but was reading from manu script. This only added to his confuBion, for the paper crackled and rattled and wiggled and wobbled. He stuck to it, however, and at last, after finishing, he sank into his chair and took long breaths, sipping from time to time at his glass of water. "Well, how did I do?" he asked Dr. Harper 'when he had recovered enough to speak. "First rate," was the genial reply. "You did splendidly, but why did you read each line of your poem twice?" The Bohemian.
