WASHISCTOS CITT, Dec. 4.—' When the senate met at coon the iraHcries were well tilled and a touch of color was lent to tha scene by the bright winter toilets of the ladies preaent. After the vice president's gavel fell, the blind chaplain was !ed to his desk and delivered an eloquent prayer. Tbe roll call showed fiftj-six senators present. After th* passage of the usual resolutions notifying the house of the meeting ot the senate and the appointment of a committee to meet a like committee from the house to wait on the president and notify him of the assembling of con gress. and ona fixing the time of meeting at noon each day, the senate look a recess of an hour, to enable tbe committee to wait on the president. At tbe expiration of recess the senate reconvened. A message was received from the house of the appointment of a com mittee to wait on the president. Another recess of twenty minutes was taken. On re-assembling the committee to wait on the president announced the accomplish ment of its duty and that the president would at once communicate with the sen ate. Secretary Prtiden then stepped for ward and delivered the message to the ▼ice president, who laid it before the sen ate, and Secretary Cox at once began it* reading. All present, with few exceptions, gave close attention when the reading begun. Doiph gave attention to his hie of bills for a few moments, but pricked up his ears as the reading reached the Hawiian para graph. There was a general changing about in the seats of the senators when the portion of the document dealing with Hawaii was approached. Many senators, bad, however, anticipated the secretary's reading by turning to their printed copies. After this there was an evident falling off in the interest of the senators, but atten tion was bristly revived .when the para graph concerning bonds was reached. When this was passed the senators gradu ally left their seats and drifted into the cloak rooms, so that by tbe time the read ing was two-thirds concluded only twenty live senators were in the chamber, and a majority of these were engaged in conver sation among themselves. The reading was concluded at 3 o'clock, having occu pied an hour and a half. Doiph immediately arece and Mid there had been distributed in the senate printed copies of What purported to be the message of the president, in which on page 9 he found part of the page .ievwted to Hawaii, be did not hear that portion read from tbe desk. He desired to know, and thought the country did also, whether that part was inadvertently or purposely omitted by the secretary, or whether the copies which had been circulated were not true copies of tbe messsge. The vice president re sponded that the portion of the message relating to Hawaii had been inadvertently omitted by the secretary, and directed it to be read. This was done, and Doiph gave notice that he would tomorrow ad dress the senate on that part of tbe mes sage. The message was ordered to lie on the table. Numerous petitions were pre sented and many bills introduced were re ferred. A joint resolution permitting Col. Anson Mills, of the United States army, to 'lerve as an engineer on the commission to survey and fix the boundary between the United States and Mexico passed. A message received from the house an nounced the death of O'Neill and Lilly, late representatives from Pennsylvania, Cameron offered a resolution expressive of the sorrow of the senate, and appointed a committee to attend Lilly's funeral. As an additional mark of respect at 3:53 the senate adjourned. Hew the Members Listened to the Reed of the Message. Washington Citt, Dec. 4.—The galleries were filied when speaker Crisp rapped the house to order at noon, with fully 300 members in their eeata. Conspicuous among the vacancies, the empty chairs being draped in mourning, were the seats of Congressmen O'Neiil and Lilly, of Pennsylvania, the Keystone state being thus cut two short of full representation by death. Rev. E. B. Bagby, the chap lain, delivered prayer, alter which the roll was called, showing -40 members present. H. 8. Bundy, who was elected to succeed the late Representative Knoche, of Ohio, appeared before the bar of the house and took the naih of office. Resolutions were passed notifying the senate thai the house was ready to proceed to business. an<l ap pointing a committee to wait on the presi dent. Levi T. Griffin, successor of the late Congressman Chipman, of Michigan, wss sworn in. Various reports of bureau offi cers were formally laid before the house. The committee on appropriations asked unanimous consent tor considertion of • bill appropriating s.io.««io additional to pay salaries of officials engage! in enforcement of the Chines* deportation and registrar t on act; agreed to. Mines of Pennsylvaniaasked unanimous consent for consideration of a resolution for the appointment of a committee to in vestigate tbe Lehigh railway strike. Kll -of Texas objected and the resolution was referred. At t J.'* the ccmmi;(M to wait on the president reported its doty discharged, and that the president would shortly com m inirate with the house in writing. Ten m.nutes later Secretary Pruden appeared wah the message, and Clerk Kerr began to real it. The reading waa hatened to with marked attention. Daring tbe reading of the firat portion of the message mating to our foreign rela tione et-Speaker Thoroaa B Heed bunt through a aide door and came running across the area in front of the ipeaker's rostrum. When he reached his seat he de liberately lighted a cigar and aat puffing away complacently whtie the readm* pr«>- ceoded. As reference to tbe Hawaiian affair waa reached the members straight eneduoand «a»e tbe closest pomble at tention, but no expreaaion either of ap proval or disapproval was indulged m. There seemed to do a general air of disap pointment. however, that no little erace was allotted to tins qussuoa. The recom mendations reiatieo to an international monetary conference and request for (artier authority loi t-e ~*»„e ol boada i THE floras. caused many sign; bean t shares of tha head on ibt part of extreme silver ®f>- Tha president's boid indorse ment of tha pension policy of the interior department, of cm! sernce reform, and his appeal for rigid economy in appropria tions aso attracted attention. When tne reference to the tarit! aas reached the ir.emoers crowded about the c.erk'a desk. The forceful utterance relative to the duty of congress on the tariff and the hearty indorsement Riven the Wilson bill seemed to pi ease tne Democratic members irresily, but much surprise was evident when thai section of the message was read stating »hat the ways and means committee nad embraced in its p*an several additional interna* revenue taxes, and a small tax on incomes of certain corporations. As It was understood the internal revenue features and income tax had not been ab solutely decided upon, the president's an nouncemeat came in the nature of a sur prise. A roar of applause greeted the conclu sion of the reading. t»en. Bingham, who had been selected by the Pennsylvania delegation to make the announcement of the deaths of Rep resentatives O'Neill and Lilly, was then recogmxed. A c umittee was appointed to attend the funeral of the late Repre sentative O'Neill, of Pennsylvania, and at 3 p. m., aa a further mark of respect, tha house adjourned. * BSTIMATBft FOR 1804 93.

INTERNAL RKVKK'K COLLECTOR James A. Ms«4sf, of VtteMfer, Stated for tk« Ofllrr. Washington City, Dec. 4.—[Special.] The appointment of a collector of internal revenue for the district of Oregon and Washington may be expected now in a very short time. In fact it is practically settled here who is to be the man. Oregon politicians who are after the place are doomed to disappointment, and there is no small number of office-seekers in tbe state of Washington who will wonder whv their much vaunted "strong pulls" have proved ineffective. There is Col. Frank J. Parker, for example, who. ever since his defeat for collector of customs, has been telling everyone that he had a dead mortal cinch on the othir piace. Well, the doughtv colonel's chances, as one views it from the point of vantage of the appoint ing power, must have been largely imag inative. Then there is Henry B:ackman, state senator in Oregon, who has felt happy ever since some one returned from Wash ington a few months ago and told him Carlisle had said there was "a little Jew out in Oregon wft© seemed born for the piace." Henry will have to go back to keeping store. Not to keep Washington politicians longer in suspense, it may be authoritatively stated that James A. Monday ts the man. Glancing over his indorsements and seeing the names at tached thereto one cannot wonder at the selection. He has no end of in.luential friends and these constitute the pole that will kn<»ck the persimmons. rr««r*M M »h« Tariff Bill.

*SH!XOTO* CITT, Dec. 4—Following ia the text of the preaideot's message, read in congress today: To the Congress of the United StnUs: The constitutional duty which requires the president from time to time to give the congress information of the state of the I*nion, and recommend to their consider ation such measures as be shall judge necessary, is fittingly entered upon by recommending to tbe congress a careful consideration of the statements and well supported recommendations contained in the reports of the departments whose chiefs are charged with the executive work of the government. In an effort to abridge this communication as much as is consistent with its purpose, I shall supple ment a brief reference to the contents of the departmental reports, with the men tion of such executive business and inci dents as are not embraced therein, and by such recommendations as appear to be at this particular time appropriate. rOKIIGX 

RELATION*. Ttee Stat* Department Has Met aa4 Ad justed Every DlAcaltjr. While our foreign relations have not at ail times during the past year been en tirely free from perplexing and embarrass ing situations, yet none remain that wiil not yield to a spirit of fairness and love of justice which, joined with consistent firm ness, has characterised a truly American policy. My predecessor baving accepted the office of arbitrator of the long-stand ing Missions boundary dispute, tendered to tbe president by the Argentine Republic and Braxil, it has been my agreeable duty to receive the envoys commissioned by these ststes to try before me tbe evidence and arguments in behalf of their respec tive government. THX 

REVOLT IK BRAZIL. The outbreak of domestic hostilities in ths republic of Brsxil found tha United States alert to watch tba intereets ot our citizens iu that country, with which wa carry on important commerce. Several vessels of our new navy are now and for soms time have been stationed at Kio Ja neiro. The struggle being between tba es tablished government, which controls tha machinery of the administration and with which we maintain friendly relations, and certain officers of ths navy employing their command in an attack an the na tional capital and chief seaport, and lack ing, as it docs, the elements of divided ad ministration, I have failed to see that tha insurgents can reasonably ctaitn recogni tion as belligerents. Thus the position of our government has been that of an atten tive but impartial observer of an unfortu nate conflict. Emphasizing our fixed pol icy of impartial neutrality in such a con dition of affairs as now exists, 1 deemed it necessary to disavow, in a msnner not to be misunderstood, the unsuthorixed action of the lata naval commander of these waters in saluting a revolting Braxilian admiral, beiug indisposed to countenance an act calculated to give gratuitous sanc tion to ths local insurrection. THE UIARRCI. WITH CIIILE. The convention between our government and Chile, baving for its object the settle ment and adjustment of the demands of the two countries against each other, has been made effective by the organization of the ciaims commission provided for. The two governments tailing to agree upon the third member of the commission the good offices of the president of the Swiss republic were invoked, as provided in tbe treaty, and the sslection of tbe Swiss rep resentative in the country ty complete the organization was greatly gratifying to the I'nlted States and Chile. The vexatious question of a so-called legation asylum for offenders against thestate%nd its laws was presented anew in Chile by tbe unauthor ized action of the lata United States minister in receiving at his official residence two persons who bad failed in an attempt at revolution and against whom criminal charges were pending, growing out of a former abortive disturbance. The doctrine of asylum as applied to tbis case is not sanctioned by the best precedents and, when allowed, tends to encoursge se dition and strife. I' nder no circumstances can the representatives of this govern ment be permitted, under the id defined fiction ol extra-territorial rights, to inter rupt the administration of criminal jus tice in countries to which they are ac credited. A temperate demand having been made hy the Chilean government for ihe correction of this conduct in tbe in stance mentioned, the minister *as in structed no longer to harbor offenders. THE BE'iISTRATIO* Ol IHis ML Tha legislstton ol last year, known as theOeary law, requiring tbe registration of all Chinese laborers entitled to resi dence in the United states and tbe depor tation of all not complying with tbe pro vision of the act within the time prescribed, met with much opposition from tninsoien in this country. Acting upon tbe advice of eminent counsel that toe law was un constitutional, the great mass of Cainese laborers, pendug judicial inquiry aa to its validity, in good iaitb, declined to apply lor their certificates required by its pro visions. A tost, upon proceedings by habeas corpus, wss brought before the su preme court, and on May 15, I#Hl. adecunon was made by that tribunal sustaining tha Saw. it is beiieved that under tbe reewnt amendment ol tha act, extending tba t.me for registration, tba Chinese laborers thereto entitled who desire to reetde in this country wiil now avail themselves of tha renewed privilege thus afforded by establiabing by lawful procedure tbeir right to remain, and that thereby the ne cessity of enforcad deportation may to a great degree be avoided. It has devolved upon tba United States minister at Pekic, as dean of tha dip.»- matic body, aad in tba abseaoe of a repre sentative ot Sweden and Norway, to press upon tbe Chineea government reparation for the recent iaurdex of Swedish mis sionaries at Bung Pu.
