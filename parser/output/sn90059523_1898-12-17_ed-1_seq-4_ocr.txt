Miles was particularly frank in his criticism of the system now pre vailing: in the war department. When asked whether, in his judgment, mis takes in the last war could not have been avoided had the secretary of war consulted more freely the heads of the army and confined his attention principally to the ministerial functions of his office, Gen. Miles replied with emphasis: "I certainly do." He declar ed that no man could go into the war department as its civil head and deal with the important questions involved with the accuracy of judgment of those who had been trained during a lifetime to the service. He unhesitatingly de nounced the method adopted by Sec retary Alger of passing over the heads of officers of the higher rank and se lecting a favorite from among those of a subordinate rank. "It would have been perfectly simple," he said, if the secretary at the outbreak of the war did not like the general in command of the army, to pass him by and take the next officer in rank by placing the commanding- officer at home on waiting orders; or, if he did not like the second in rank, to send him home on waiting orders, and so on down the line until he found the man whom he believed to be the proper man for the place. But to pass over the heads of the command ing officers and go so far down the line as to pick out a subordinate, simply because he was a favorite and had seme political influence, could not be tolerated. I do not think it is accord ing to the constitution." Gen. Miles was emphatic, also, in his advocacy of a reorganization of the army which should give the grade of "General" to the commanding officer and provide for two lieutenant gener als; and he significantly remarked that these two offices might just now ba appropriately filled by Gens. Brooke and Merritt as a reward due to their merits. As for himself, he said he was ready to "retire tomorrow" if congress saw proper, or he was willing to have any provision which might apply to him made inoperative for five years, by which time he would have retired from the army and could not profit by it. It must be conceded that Gen. Miles' manliness has been reflected many times since the close of the war, and the people have reached a clearer un derstanding of his real worth than was possible during times of peace. His ill treatment by the boorish Alger and his complete self-control under great provocation have won for him public sympathy and admiration. Hi 3 feituation has also served to emphasize the unfitness of the Michigan drum major for the civil headship of the flepartment. The selection of Alger for the post, by the president, was scanda lous enough, but it is inexplicable why, as commander-in-chief of the army, Mr. McKinley should have permitted the secretary of war to exercise his power so arbitrarily in the direction of humiliating Gen. Miles and endeavor- Ing to exalt Shatter in popular favor. But Gen. Miles has the consolation of knowing that the scheme has operated In a reactionary way and that the ends Bought to be accomplilshed were un realized. The Canadian Conference. There does not appear to be any prospect of an early agreement being fcrrived at by the conference now deal- Ing with the subject of future relations between Canada and the United States. Both sides are striving for their own protection, and there is little of the give and take spirit evinced in the de liberations. Perhaps one of the most serious obstructions is that pertaining to the lumber interests of this section, and. in a limited degree, of the South! The insistence is determinedly main tained that there shall be no lowering of the duty. Maryland and Virginia coal interests are urgent in their de mands that Canadian bituminous coal ■hall not be permitted to come into competition with the mines of those states, and operators are working themselves up into a condition of hysterical alarm over the fanciful pic ture of an outpour of bituminous coal from Canada upon the Atlantic sea board, thus working destruction to their own industries. Even Massachusetts, whose fondness for the Canadian Pacific railroad is so conspicuous, sends up a wail from Gloucester against the letting down of the bars which now restrain the avalanche of Canadian fish which, if permitted to gain an impetus, would completely ruin that savory old town. It is an odd sort of a pipe upon which these honest fishermen play. They are thoroughly patriotic, of course, and advance their objections to a conces sion in the fish tariff along the high ground that the sailormen of their community represent a sort of nursery for the navy, and consequently they should be encouraged in the main tenance of their industry. And so it goes. There does not ap pear to be much difficulty in the way of arriving at satisfactory conclusions on the important points of the bonding privileges, the adjustment of bound ary lines, the seal fisheries and tho like. But when it comes to disturbing tariffs and to propositions looking to trade reciprocity, disagreement appears to be inevitable. Amend tha War Rovenue Act. Mr. Dlngtey, chairman of the ways and means committee of the nous* of representatives, announces in an inter view that no amendment of the war revenue act will be undertaken at the present session of congress. That measure was hastily formulated and acted upon, and so loosely were some of its provisions drafted and so imperfectly were they considered in committee of the whole that the rev enue officials themselves are uncer tain of their meaning and hopelessly at sea in their power to correctly in terpret them. The commissioner of in ternal revenue has been greatly em barrassed in making certain rjlingw, and considerable litigation is already pending with a view to having the law properly construe! by the courts. Notable illustrations exist in tha controversy as to who shall pay the tax upon receipts given by express companies, as well as that in connec tion with telegraph messages. "While there does not appear to bo any doubt that the express business is subject to a tax, the commissioner's ruling, for some reason, exempts business locally in the cities. No satisfactory determi nation has as yet been arrived at as to whether the sender of a telegraph message should pay the tax or whether the burden shall be borne by the com panies. Another ruling by Commission er Scott is to the effect that, in certain cases, receipts given for payment of rentals are taxable under the class of leases. These are only some of the minor points in doubt. It would seem to be the duty of congress to take the en tire subject up for reconsideration with a view to elucidating all these obscure provisions. Punish the Rascals. The Dispatch is doubtless correct when it says that "nothing but delib erate fraud can explain the discrepancy in the count of the vote in the Second precinct of the Fourth ward." It calls for "a thorough Investigation of thi3 infamy," and the punishment of the guilty party or parties. It is gratify ing to have at least one of the Repub lican newspapers of St. Paul unite with Tha G1 ob cin bringing this class of offenders to justice. The Glo b c, a few days before election, called at tention to the possibility of under handed work being done In this par ticular precinct. Its justification ap pears to be fully established by the events of this week. It is now for the authorities to take the matter up and punish the offend ing officials. They must do this, for the good name of St. Paul Is seriously involved. The fact that the offender may prove to be a Republican should constitute no reason for the abandon ment of his prosecution. He should be railroaded as an example to the vicious element in politics of both parties. And while the- grand jury is about it, ihoy should investigate certain other irregularities, which The Globe has recently pointed out, in every one of which, by the way, the offender is closely identified with the ring of Re publican politicians who are now man aging the affairs of St. Paul and of Ramsey county. These door-mat thieves must be oust ed from office. The gang must go. Open the Doors ! It \s not too early to suggest, and it will from this time onward be appro priate to insist, that, when the treaty of Paris comes up in the senate for consideration, the discussion shall not be carried on behind closed doors. President McKinley saw fit to select three United States senators as mem bers of the commission. This extraor dinary course, it is alleged, was pur sued in order that when the treaty came before the senate there might be those present with a right to a voice, who, from participation in the nego tiations, would be familiar with every detail and bo able to explain every point on which enlightenment might be sought. For it must be admitted in behalf of the people of these United States in general that they exist in a condition of what may almost be styled "crass | ignorance" upon all those things which appear to have entered into the delib erations of the commission with so much force as to completely set aside the policy of the republic which has been maintained since the organiza tion of the government. Unless the doors of the senate are opened to the public and the press, the valuable in formation which the discussion is like ly to produce must he lost. This treaty is the most important paper of its kind with which this gov ernment has ever had to deal, and the people have a right to demand the en lightenment and education upon tho general subject which an open discus sion will afford. There can be no state secrets involved In this connection of which the public should not be In formed. Let the principle of the "open door" be applied at home, as well as in the Philippines. National Committeeman Thomas D. O'Brien voiced the views of Democrats generally in the interview printed in yesterday's Globe, when he urged the selection of a Democrat for the com plimentary nomination for United States senator. There are others who will be heard from later. The kerosene can is showing a de cided disposition to run the bicycle of ISS&.

"Can anybody tell, after reading his mes sage, how the president stands on the ques tion of annexing the Philippine islands, or what his views are as to the necessity and proper methods of currency reform? After the fearless frankness of Grover Cleveland the diluted vagaries of William McKlnley are enough to produce nausea in the minda of those who have a high regard for the presi dential office.

The paper quotes liberally from President McKlnley's last speech in Chicago to support its contention that the Americans are pledged to give the Filipinos independence. Gen.

"It is admitted that the deficit will reach $112,000,000 this fiscal year, and this amounts to an admission that the deficit will continue thereafter under present revenue legislation, and yet no new taxes are advised, and no "ways of offsetting the new financial burdens with reductions in the old are pointed out," comments the Springfield Republican (lud.).

IRON THE BAROMETER IT INDICATES THE TREND OF TRADE IN AX,L ITS VARIOUS BRANCHES MILLS CANNOT FILL ORDERS Compelled to Decline Foreign Bus iness Owing tol Inability to De liver the Finished Product When Demanded —— Am Iron and Steel Go, So Goes the Business of the Country. NEW YORK; Deo. 16.— Bradstreet's tomorrow will say: Likening the general business of the country to that of. a water course, it may be authoritatively stated that nearly all the channels of seasonable trade are at the present time running full, and In some lines of business the stream is virtually out of the banks. This is particularly the case in iron and steel, where production and consump tive demand are alike going on at an unprecedented rate, at a time, too. v.hen it is usual to look for quietness and even dullness In this industry. Nothing like the present activity in this branch of trade has been seen for many years past, if, indeed, it has ever been equaled. Advices from all the leading centers of Iron production are of an exceptionally eager demand for the crude and manufactured products and of advancing prices, the only anxiety expressed being that by buyers desir ing early delivery. Probably never be fore in the country's history has It been possible for an American steel company to refuse a profitable order for rails for foreign account on the plea that its mills were already fully occupied so far ahead as to preclude its trying for the business. Higher prices for pig iron, steel billets, soft steel and all sorts of car material are all reported. The production of raw material is at its maximum. Ship building, too, con tributes its portion of activity to the lion trade by its urgent calls for ma terial. In other lines of business the situa tion as regards prices is a favorable one, notably among the advances re ported being nearly all the coals, cot ton, coffee, lumber, copper, lead and a variety of other less prominent sta ples. Following the slight recession shown in wheat values of last week an improved demand for export has again developed, which is evidence of the fact that the stories of keen competition from Argentine and Russia have been more or leas discounted, the United States remaining, sm for some time past, the principal source of supply of the world. Increased interest is being taken in cotton at the advanced price, and the situation of the manufactured product has been strengthened by skill ful management of the print cloth sit uation, which, in turn, has Induced a' more liberal demand for kindred prod ucts for the spring trade. Seasonable quietness is reported in the lumber trade, Uut prices retain all their old strength,' and an active de mand is looked, for with the turn of the year. Holiday trade is reported extremely active at most market. The country's export trade Is of the largest volume ever known, that for November surpassing the total fcr De comber a year ago, with the indications favoring a total trade for the calendar year at least one-sixth larger than a year ago, and our sales abroad aggre gating two dollars for every dollar's worth we buy. Wheat, including flour, shipments for the week aggregate 6,076,625 bushels, Portland, Me., not received, against 6, --868,952 bushels last week; 4,604,393 bush els in the corresponding- week of 1897; 2,056,943 bushels in 1895. and 3,554,330 bushels in 1894. Since July 1 this year the exports of wheat aggregate 109,403, --71! i bushels, against 118,809,097 bushels last year. Corn exports for the week aggregate 3,251,936 bushels, against 4 - 395,535 bushels last week; 4,129, 878 bush els in this week a year ago; 2,814,150 bushels in 1896 2,057,970 bushels in 1895 and 658,066 bushels in 1894. Since July 1; this year corn exports aggregate 72 - 278,764 bushels, against 71,381,334 bush els during the same period a year ago. Business failures are about nominal numbering 233 for the week, against 237 last week; 283 in this week a year ago; 359 in 1896; 385 in 1895, and 329 in 1£94. Business failures for the week in the Dominion of Canada numbered 32 against 29 last week; 43 in this week a year ago, 39 in 1896; 42 in 1895, and 24 in 1894. 

ENORMOUS TRANSACTIONS. Both Bonds and Stocks Have Been in Most Active Demand. NEW YORK, Dec. 16.—Bradstreet'a finan cial review tomorrow will say: "An enormous aggregate of transactions In both bonds and stocks, with an unusually wide rango in the variety of securities traded in, have been accompanied this week by ad vances whl^h carried prices for a majority of the stock exchange lists to the highest level of the year. While large speculative interests have beem active and manipula tion has net been lacking, the most conspic uous developments were the large influx of public purchasing and the equally marked buying for American account, accompanied by great activity and advances in the Ameri can department of the, London market. In many respects the movement was calculated to bring to mind the so-called boom of 1879-80 the more so because in both cases a series of exceptionally largo credit balances in the foreign trade of the United States, accom panied by an expansion of general business and decidedly favorable results as regards railroad earnings and dividends, furnish the basis lor speculative confidence. In the pres ent case, however, the conditions, both in these respects and In regard to the accu mulated capital of the country, are deemed so superior to those upon which previous demonstrations of confidc-ovce were based that some of the mcist prominent Individual interests in- Wall street are emphatic in de claring that prices wiil be carried to a much hlgheT level. Such views in fact find gen eral ored*«nce in financial circles, but at <he same time the market, after a remarkable ex hibition of Its bullish temper in the early part of the week, presented all the symptoms of a heavy realizing of profits by professional ! Interests, which to a considerable extent checked advances in the parts of the list in which the upward movement had been most pronounced, and diminished the vol ume of trading to a considerable extent." ALL RECORDS BROKEN. Phenomenal and Continued Growth of American Trade. NEW YORK. Deo, 18.—Dun & Co.'s week ly review of trade will tomorrow say: December is adding a surprising close to the most surprising year of American history. November surpassed all other months of the ceratury in vo'.ume of business, and la pro ductions, and thua^faiv.December is even do- Ing better in pwments through clearing houses, In railroad, r earnings, in foreign trade, in output of pig into, In, activity and strength of securities. But th£t is saying a great deal, tor m all these jand other tests No vember was far the be3t month of American financial history. December began with a pig Iron output of 235,628 'ions weekly, against 228,935 Nov. 1, anti with stocks of unsold iron diminished 25,988 ,tons In November, which indicates a: consumption of 1,024,318 tons during the month: . Not only is the out put the greatest ever known, but it has in creased 22V& per cent since 1892, when the greatest monthly record then ever known was made and Bessemer' 1 pig was then selling for $11.T5 at Pittsburg, but until the middle of November sold at $10.10 this year. It has since risen with enormous demand and sales to $10.55 there, \rtth "gray forge $9.35, but the Chicago market Is also strong with sales of 100,000 tons, Besides 25,000 tons billets, which had risen at ' Pittsburg with big transactions, to $18» With scarcity of pig Iron feared both East and West, there Is as yet no rise what, ever In finished products, although the do m&nfi Is far beyond all precedents. Steel rails ' are quoted at $17 per ton at the East, al though the Laekawama company has takan orders for 100.000 tons at the Wart, both the Pittsburg and Chicago works beta* sold far ahead, and bldto for 32,000 tons for Aus tralia are to be opened today, wiilie Cfeioag* has pending a bid for 250.000 tons deliverable ta two years in Asiatic Russia. In other Hues the demand for flushed product* 1* «C tt}« aame surprising magnitude, especially In Piatea and in sheets. iiia ■woolen Industry also com«e to the rront with very extensive purchases of wool oy large houses and small, helped by mate n»l concessions at Boston, bo that sales at tue tihree chief markets hay» been 17,968,700 pounds, of which 13,830,000 were domestic, against 15,807,100 last year, of which 7,433,000 were domestic, and 16,504,100 in the same weeks of 1892. of whioh. 12,399,600 were do mestic.

Philadelphia has good business out seems inclined to ask 1 to 2o more tnian the Boston price for fine fleeces, Ohio ax being offered at Boston for 26^ cents. Much Improved demand for goods has started many mills long idle, and the prospects for k? next season with wool at more reason able prices, has decidedly improved. No man can say that the advance in cot ton, with a atroDg milling demand at home, cue to orders for goods which lift prices generally a little, Is not warranted in view of the heavy export trade. The foreign de mand is really inexplicable, considering its' volume In comparison with movements of goods from Great Britain, but dealers abroad are doubtless seeking to protect themselves for the future. Failures for the week have been 281 In the United States, against 829 last year, and 31 In Canada, agaiust 28 last year. SENOR RIOS' GRIEF. Say* Spain Has Been Mistreated by the United States. LONDON, Dec. 17.—The Paris corre spondent of the Times, M. da Blowltz, telegraphs this morning a long inter view with the president of the Spanish peace commission, Senor Montero Rios, hi the course of which he represents the Spanish commissioner as complain ing that the "Americans have acted as 'vainquers parvenus,' who do not yet know misfortune or defeat." Senor Montero Rios remarked that ":when, later on, they also have Buffered reverses, they will be less inflexible to those who have suffered defeat." The Spanish commissioner contended, according to M. de Blowltz, that the Philippines are still unconquered, and that their conquest would not be ac complished quickly. What most pained him. however, ap pears to have been "America's attempt to deprive Spain of her honor by re fusing to arbitrate regarding the Maine." He asserted confidently that the Spanish government was in no danger from Carlism. MAY 

ARREST CARLISTS. Madrid Authorities Fear the Talk ed-of Uprlningr. MADRID, via Bordeaux, Dec. 16.— The government is considering the question of arresting the principal Car lists. The most rigorous censorship of telegrams is maintained, and all mes sages relative to Carlist movements are stopped. Accounts of the recent disturbances In Havana are strictly prohibited. El Heraldo this morning, painting a gloomy picture of the financial situa tion, shows that the interest on all the public debts amounts to 635,000,000 pesetas, while the revenue is only 866, --000,000 pesetas. Of this revenue the civil list, civil pensions and other ir reducible charges absorb 74,000,000 pe setas, leaving only 157,000,000 pesetas available for the army, navy and all other demands. In view of this situa tion, El Heraldo urges an equitable reduction in the Interest on the debts. ALMOST A CRISIS. Serious Friction in the New French Cabinet. PAPvIS, Dec. 16.—A stormy debate took place in the chamber of deputies today on the corruption that charac terized the recent election at Nar boztna said to have been practiced by a candidate who was a protege of the Meline cabinet. The discussion nearly led to a min isterial crisis, when M. Guillaln, min ister for the colonies, and M. Deloncle, minister for commerce, both of whom were identified with the Meline cab inet, threatened to resign. M. Dupuy, the premier, after an In terview with the incensed ministers, succeeded In mollifying them, and the chamber dropped the matter, but the discussion has revealed friction that is likely to crop up on a future occasion. POPE SENDS THANKS. Grateful for Promises of Protection for Catholics in Colonies. LONDON, Dec. 17.—The Rome corre spondent of the Daily Chronicle says: "In response to the Vatican's inquiry on the subject, President McKinley has sent an assurance that the Catholics In Cuba and the Philippines will enjoy the same ample liberty as the Catholics in America. "The Washington government has also promised the pope that measures will be taken to prevent provisional governments despoiling convents cr seizing ecclesiastical property. "The pope has sent his warmest thanks to President McKinley." 

TACIT "AGREEMENT. Understanding: Between Italy and Great Britain in Africa.
