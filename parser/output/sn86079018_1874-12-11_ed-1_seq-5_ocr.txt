The report of the Secretary of the shows the navy to be in a remarkably efficient condition, both as regards tha number of vessels, their armament and sea-going quali ties. One year ago the navy consisted of 1G5 vessels of all classes, armed with 1269 guns, exclusive of howitzers. Since that time there have been added to it eight new steam sloops, two torpedo vessels and one dispatch boat, and it has been diminished by the sale of two wooden and eleven light-drauglit iron vessels, leaving as the present number 169 vessels with 1254 guns, the armament having been slightly increased by the increase in the n um ber of guns on the new ships of this whole number 26 have sail power only, and of these four are to be placed ut the disposal of State and local authorities as school or training ships under the direction of the act of Congress providing for such disposition. Seven are in use only as receiv ing skips, t7vo ace old line of battle ships which have been mt the stocks for many years, and eight are of the old type and in bad con dition. and can be used only for barracks or stationary school ships, leaving live which can be put to practical use at sea as store ships. transports, or surveying vessels. ouj: steam navy consists of 157 vessels of all clisses and in every condition. Of this number twenty-five I are.tugs, used, with one or two exeeptioas, for yard purposes ; thirty-seven are ar mored vessel*, and two are torpedo boats, leaving seventy-three steam vessels, originally of a class adapted for cruising. These are classified at pres- nt as follows: No. Guns. First rate....... .... 5 183 Second rate..... ..... 31 510 Third rate..... .... 31 133 Fourth rate ..... 6 21 Total....... .. 73 902 Tong. 15,163 I 57,528 J 3 183 I '___ I 94,830 I Of the iron-clad or armored vessels, sixteen | Tito Secretary says lie has given special at-1 tention to placing the iron-clad vessels of the navy in a condition lor active and efhcient 1. service, and adds ! ! are of a class and in condition for actual and efficient service; four others, of the class of powerful donble-turreted monitors, are actual- 1 ly on hand undergoing repairs, and a fifth is well worth the same attention; but the re mainder may be counted as really useless for j any active and efficient purpose. Four of the largest of them, designed and commenced during the war, have never been launched. aud consist, in fact, only of their wooden I frames, still on the stocks, and their incom plete plating and machinery stored at the navy yards, and though their names and de signed dimensions appear on the navy list, and the remaining twelve of the class known as light-draught monitors not able to carry I their turrets, guns and munitions of war, arc valuable only as old material. Of the se\ enty three steam cruising vessels five of over 2000 | tons each have remained on the stocks since the war, never having been launched, and are not estimated to be worth for our purposes the cost of comple tion, seven are condemned and laid up iß I ordinary as unfit for further use, three others with condemned machinery, and forty-one are in commission 1'or various duties. Of the lemaiuing seventeen, upon which we must rely to take the place ot (he cruising vessels as they return home and are put out of com mission, two are hud up ready tor service, I seven are repairing at the various navy yards, and eight are building under special appro priations of Congress. Thus it will be seen that one-half of the steam navy adapted to cruising is in commission and in actual ser vice. This number of vessels cannot be pru dent ly diminished, but if it is to be main tained there must be a gradual and constant to addition to the navy to supply the plaees of those which are each year found to be worn out and unfit for further service, and for this I purpose a fixed amount for tonnage should I he built every year. This amount may be I small, but it should be constant and untailing. A Class History. [From the Mobile Register.] ltev. Dr. Thos. U. Dudley, of Virginia, re cently of Baltimore, has been elected Bishop of Kentucky, to succeed Bishop Cummins, deposed. Ah! Tom. my boy, do you remem ber the " Dedils" of the University of Virgi nia? What jolly times those were! Now you area bishop! Harry Toulman is a judge. Otey is out West dealing faro. Not long ago we picketl up Patterson on the streets dead drunk and forwarded him to Mississippi. Arne]], of Tennessee, turned Radical, went to Congress, and died. Warmotli made Ken naril a Supreme Court Judge ot Louisiana. Thompson was killed leading un Arkansas regiment at Shiloh. All the rest of us who •re not dead or forgotten are struggling to keep our noses above water. I ou alone are bishop, my dear Tom! From the newspaper offices of the Gulf, from the faro banks of the West, from the judicial seats, from the studios oi professors, and the pulpits of the ecclesi 'etics, we take off our hals and cheer for the Oew* Kentucky Bishop as the best-souled lel lo «'- brightest intellect, truest friend, and Purest spirit old Virginia ever gave birth to. ..Hr.

Grant's recom mendations carried very little weight, and those of to-day are scarcely regarded by any body. THE 

QUESTION 04 RESUMPTION. Th e outpourings from Attorney General \V llliams s outrage mill were expected, and passed unheeded. The only debate is over the financial issue, and here members take sides according to their financial views, sub ject, however, to this modification: that Dem ocratic members who last session opposed an expansion of the currency are by no means ready to agree to the Government policy for forcing resumption. It is predicted to-night by one well informed member that the Com mittee on Banking and Currency will not in dorse the policy of the message. Such prom inent Republicans as Butler and Kelley will probably make open war upon it. For the first time since the Republican party came to possess power, there are visible and decisive breaches of discipline revealing themselves on the floor of the lower house of Congress. The President's message is to them a bomb shell. It makes a square issue; in fact, a series of square issues, which the managers do not pretend to deny, that they will find themselves powerless to subdue. ' The first gun of the war was tired to-day by Pig-iron Kelley, who says broadly that lie will oppose certain measures of the administration, no matter wimt political associations it may lead Undoubtedly a good deal of N„..,..........__ , I him to form _______ _ ________ I demoralization was expected in the Repuhli cans, but the meeting of Congress shows f ' in peculiar forms.

Gayety Theater.— The performance last I evening at this theater was overflowing with fun and side-splitting burlesques. The whole company deserve mush credit for the admira ble manner in which they acquitted tkem selves in their respective parts. A good audi ence was in attendance, and seemed from the I continued applause, to enjoy themselves to no mtie extent. A Corner in Bivalves and Snapper*. About the cheekiest enterprise of modern times is that undertaken by a ring of Mobil operators who now seek to obtain from tin Legislature of Alabama the exclusive right to snap up all the red-snappers and raise all the festive bivalves from the vasty deep of Mobile bay. These gentlemen are doubtless I reformers, but such reforms as they propose I are well calculated to raise a rebellion from I the wave-washed shores of the gulf to th wind-swept prairies of Wyoming. Then, just to think of the plea which these ene mies of all bun vivants put forward to justify this outrage against the best interests of a convivial world. These unconscionable axe-grinders have gone to Montgom ery, and, with a view to catch the Reform Democratic and Granger vote iu the Legislature they talk about the great reve nues which, as a corporate body, they are yearning to pour into the State treasury, whereas, as tlie matter now stands. Tom, Dick and Harry go fishing anti oyster.grap pling, and capture innumerable hosts ot tin* earmine-hued tenants of the water, and raise uncounted bushel* of the delicious shell-fish, and for the privilege pay nothing into the public coffers. Worse than Ca ta jines ! Shall they be allowed to tax our dainties? Shall we be compelled to be taxed for those fat, round, appetizing Mobile l.i. valves in order that messieurs, the monopo lists, mar grow rich? Shall all the oyster men of Mobile and all the fishermen for red snappers pay toll to a company of monopo lists for the'privilege of engaging in their calling v Never. The country cannot and will not submit to such tyranny. If the new Democratic Legislature of Alabama signal izes its exercise of power by granting thi* monopoly privilege, the cause is irretriev ably damaged, and the sun of 18 1 6 v> ill shine on the wreck of the party. Human nature cannot stand everything, especially no. tax it s ovsters and red-sna pper*. o * 7 as THE CITY. Foul Play.— Some who have speculation in their eye are on the look ont for cheap bargains. There was a sad experience of this mania at the residence of Dr. Maas. No. 65 Dauphine street, where some one who has no conscienct or did not expect to be invited to the family Christmas dinner, entered the yard at the dead hour of midnight and de spoiled the madame of some of her cherished poultry, on which she fondly hoped to regale her friends during the approaching festivi ties. May they rest - Fractured * His Ankle. -John Conneli, while at work on the Iron Building, foot of Canal street, yesterday afternoon a cidt ntly slipped and fell, and vfras hurt quite seriously. He was conveyed without delay to the ( harity Hospital, where, after hav ing been attended to by the doctor, it was found that the fill produced a componnd fracture of the ankle. Badly Hurt.— John Schafer, a German, was, yesterday morning, caught iu the ma chinery at the Louisiana Oil Factory, on Pe ters street, where lie is employed, and very badly hurt His arm above the elbow is broken, and his band too is very much lace rated. Schafer was conveyed to the Charity Hospital, where he will assuredly b< well cared for. Dangerously Wounded. —About half-past 9 o'clock last night, a difficulty occurred in the drinking saloon, coiner of Dryades and Union streets, in which a woman, named Emma Johnson, was shot and dangerously wounded in the left side of the body with pistol, by a man named Popite, other name unknown, who made his escape. The wounded woman was conveyed to the Charity Hospital, where she received the proper medical attention. Suicide. Mr. H. 1». Fleming, of the Canal street ferry boat Louise, reports while cross ing from the city to Algiers, about !• o'clock last night, an unknown man jumped over board and was drowned before any assistance could be rendered. He was seen about the fern landing before going on the boat by Officer Clavin, of the Harbor Precinct, who describes him to be about 22 years old, dressed in black coat and hat. He had a letter in his hands, aud tore it up before going on the ferry. The ciii.se of the rash act is unknown. Sudden Death. A woman named Dolly Lewis, aged about MO years, aud a native of Louisiana, died suddenly at JÎ o'clock last night at her residence, No- < : 1.' Perdido street. Coroner Chastant has bien notified, and will hold an inquest. of ' a In d The Stolon Murillo." Jt would certainly tijuteai* that there is a ver\ obvious blunder m the telegraphic re lation of the alleged theft of a painting bv Murillo from the Cathedral of Seville. The picture is described as "St Anthony Tempted by Women," and a* there i* no ac count ot any such picture have ever been in the Cathedral of Seville, noram mention of this subject among the paintings of Murillo, we are constrained to believe that the state ment an error. It is probable that the picture indicated is the " St. Anthony of Padua." a large canvas which has heretofore been in the chapel of the baptistry of the Seville Cathe dral, and i* counted as one of Muirillo's greatest works. 'Ibis picture was painted in 1656, on an order from the ( hapter of the Cathedra], and cost 10,000 Spanish reals. It is thus described by an authority : •'Kneeling near a table, the shaven, hrowu froeked saint is surprised by a visit from the infant Jesus, a charming, naked babe, who descends in a golden flood of glory, walkin'' the bright air as if it w< re the earth, while around him floats ai.-d hovers a company of cherubs, most ot them children, forming a rich garland ot graceful forms and lovely faces. Gazing up in rapture t.t this dazzling vision, the saint kneels, with anas out stntched, to receive the approaching Saviour. On the table at his side there is a 7-ase con taining lilies, painted ivilh such Zeuxis-like skill that bird*, wandering among the aisles, have been seen attempting to perch noon it and peck the flowers; and Lithe left of the picture an arch discloses the architectural perspective of the cloister." It is related, though doubted by many, that after the retreat of the French from Spain in 1813, the Duke of Wellington offered to buy this picture for England, covering it with ounces of gold, which would haw* brought its cost up to about 648,000, the canvas being fifteen feet sonar . In 1P33 ti e "St. Anthony" was repaired—which inSp-.inmeans 1 vainied —so that many a delicate tor.cl of Murillo'; pencil has disappeared. Eno -'ll. ' owe. er, is left to show tin- genius of the Iginai de ion and the splendor of the original colors. There were seventeen works by Murillo iu the Catli- ! edral of Seville, of which the -'Sir Anthony" i was the gem. fts loss i-, certainly a sad one, j and it seems alumst impo--.-.ible that it should ; have been stolen. It was protected by a high iron railing, which separated it from those who came t« gaze at it. The Herald of Health is o : opinion that the simple color of one's surroundings has a marked influence on his health. It says: "Yellow on the walls of onr rooms has a \er\ lepressing effect on the mind. Violet is worse. A man would go mail iu a violet papered or painted room. Black rooms, or rooms heavily draped iu mourning, produce loom or foreboding. Never wear mourning long, unless you wish to become sad and sorrowful beyond what nature ever intended-" Won't it In- jolly and merry. Won't it be jolly - nil merry. When on the 20th iaat.
