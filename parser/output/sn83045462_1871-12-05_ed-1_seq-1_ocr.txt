Thw stomach. bowels, and liver are thus cleansed by the use ofSchrnck s Mandrake Pills; but there remains in the stomach an excess *f acid, the organ is torpid and the appetite poor.

Don Caledonia Ortez, on account of seduction and breach of marriage promise resulted in a verdict ot only *7 ,.>10, wa? a clerk in the Treasury Department a couple of years ago. The discrepancy between the amount claimed and that awarded by the jury juay probably be accounted for by the fact that aho ? lived in the bouse with the defendant nearlv two years after her seduction w as accomplished, and suffered an additional tw > years to go by before commencing suit. Orn Dkt.eoate in Cox?nEss._Our citizens feel interested in everything which concerns the District of Columbia, an das much depends upon the committee In the House as well as the Sen. ate, we give below the proceedings in the House so far as relates to the right of our Delegate to a place on the committee. Both Houses have de clared, through an organic act, that the Dele gate shall be placed on the House Committte for the District, and we doubt not the rnle will be amended so as to relieve the Speaker of his embarrassment. There is no question but that Mr. Chipman will beol great service to the com mittee, and ean do much toward preparing their work. However anomalous It may seem, the ?manifest propriety and utility of the thin-* will, we think, settle the question lavoiably to tlie 1 Mstri ct. The Speaker?The Chair desires to submit to the House a <|uestlon which siniewUat em barrasses him. The law reorganizing the gov ernment of the District of Columbia pro vided that the Delegate from the District of Columbia should be a member of the Commit tee for the District of Columbia. The Chair is governed by the rules of the Home, which are made under an express provision o? the Constitution of the United States giving to each Howe the right to make its own rules; and the rules of the House provide that the Committee for the District of Columbia shall consist of nine members of the House. Look ing at the duties laid on the Chair by the rule he has referred to under the Constitution, he did not i'eel at liberty to constitute the Com mittee for the District of Columbia of ten members; and if becomes necessary, as betw -en the law. which sei med to change the rule of tl e House, and between the ru'e of the House as it stands, for the House to determine wl.at course shall be taken. If tlie Delegate from the Dis trict of Columbia is to be pr?ent with the com mittee merely in an advisory capacity, the com mittee, nnder the law of courtesy, would no doubt like to have him there. But if he is to be a voting member his function would b> a much larger one, and larger than ever was ac corded bt fore to a Delegate on this floor. Under the circumstances the Chair has not announced the Delegate from the District of Columbia as a member ot the committee, and he will wait the instructions of the House as to what should be done in the premises. Mr. Dawes?I move that the rules of the House be so suspended as to allow the appoint ment by the Speaker of the Delegate from the District of Columbia as a member of the Com mittee for the District. Mr.Wood.?It appears to me that this is a very similar question to that presented by the Dele gate from Colorado, fMr. Chaffee,] and that it Is a projier question to go to the Committee on the Biilea. I propose that it shall take that course. The Speaker?The gentleman trom New York iMr.Woodl propose* that the question be re ferred to the Committee on the Bules. If there be no objection, it wilt be so reterred. There was no objection. What with Sir Charles Diike and his anti monarchical followers in England, the Fenians in Ireland, communists in Frarce, revolutionist* in Belgium, republicans in Spain, liberals in Prussia, and International* everywhere, they are having lively times in Etireqie, and the end Is not yet. The triumph of the jieople in Belgium has emboldened the frieiuls of i>opular govern ment there and elsewhere. The German Par liament, with all their submissiveness, have shown a disposition to resist the inordinate sebeme of taxation proposed l>y the Emperor and Bismarck, and at a late sitting one of the deputies raised tlie old revolutionary cry of "War to the palace and peace to the cottage," following tt up with the ominous words, " and death to all luxurious idleness!" Bismarck did not dee in It prudent to notice them or reply, but continued writing at bis desk. In England there is no lull in the agitation. Sir Charles Dilke addressed, on November 20, a large and crowded meeting at Bristol on repre sentation mm) edncation. Prof. Kewman pre sided. and a strong republican fe-cHna was mani fested by those present. The name tot the Queen and tbe Prince of Wales were reoeived with hisses and groaae, while hearty cheers were gi v?n for a republic. Sir Charles, in tbe osorse of bis speech, dwelt upon the inequalities of the British representative system, and ueclared himself to be a republican, remarking that he made no concealment of the fact. Am another sign of the times It may be stated that tbe Dablln JfemM rep resents that at the Communist meeting in Lon don, which was p. tec ted by tbe police, the ban ners bore such mottoes is these: "DivMenof Property." "Mo Religion." "Down with tbe Queen." "To H with Everything/' The women, too, are having a hand in the business, and in Uverpool have organised a vigilance committee "to prevent hasty legislation."

Mr. Blair moved to t&k6 up th<* rt^ttotion j Ottered by him yesterday. caHIng on tbe P.esi . dent tor hi*authority to declare ui?rtUI Un in certain count if* of South Carolina. Mr. Blair said tbe resolution contemplate* that the l'roei d.ni. shall lay before tne Senate the in mm r in whii-h he ha* executed tbe exfraordinui v power* conferred ujton him by Congress. Hi- had heard that of the many citizen* of South Carolina arrested, nine-tentl?s of them had been arrested charged with crimes committed before tue ae> ot April 20. 1X71. The facts alleged in connec tion with these offences he recognized .us having been brought to the attention of the ku klux committee anterior to the passage oi" the ku klux act. Mr. Edmundssuggested thai it was not proper to discuss the merits ot the resolution on a iim tion to take up, and the Vice President so decided. Mr. Morton said much of the information called for was given in the message of the Presi dent, and also he considered that it was i?est to delay action until the re|?ortnf the committee in the late insurrectionary States b id been sub mitted. Mr. Blair said the information called for wa* not given in the President's message. The President says he had information to.justify hurl in hi? action, but does not state from whom he received it. He certainly did not get it from the committee, tor the committee had authorised no one to give him any Information, and as am rn ber ot the committee, he (Mr. B.) was of the opinion that no facts had been brought before tbe committee, which would justify his action. Mr. Conkting was opposed to taking up the resolution tor the reason* stated bv Mr. Morton, and further because the resolution was no: in the nature of good faith. It was full ot asser tion and intimations. The motion to take up was then put aud lost ayes, II; nays, 45.

It bad now been examined by two committees of the House, nnd was approved by both. He asked that the full reading Of the bill be dis pensed with. Mr. Wood (N. Y.) objected, and the bill was r< ad.

On motion of Mr. Dawes (Mass.) the House went into Committee of the Whole on the rUESIPENT'S IIRSSACK, with Mr. Whec'er (N. Y.") in the chair. Mr. Dawes offered a resolution to refer the several parts ot the President's message to the appropriate committees. Mr. Wood (N. Y.) objected to the proposed reft rt nee of certain matters to the select com mittee on the insurrectionary ?t.at?t? There was no such a standing committee of this House. He denied that there were any such things in this country as insurrectionary states. A com mittee was appointed at last "session to invetti gate certain matters in the South, and its func t ons ceased wlieu that duty had been per *'"Bed. It was improper to refer anything to ill ? committee, as it would continue it," and that w is not intended. M r. Dawes said lie could not enter upon a dis cussion of a question of fact with Mr. Wood, and that gentleman must know that there is such a committee ol the House as that 011 in sui rectionarv States. Mr. Wood denied that the committee was in tended to be continued in existence beyond the present sc^-ion of Congress.*. I.ast Congress we had a committee called the Committee on lte c>n*t ruction, and t ie gentleman's colleague from Mas achusetts, (Mr. Butler, made numer ous efforts to have it continued. The Committee 01 Insurrectionary States will cease after it shall nave reported to the House, a reference of business to it was a recognlf ion of the committee, the effect of the reference would be to con tinue it. He was opposed to making committees in this mar ner Mr. Dawes said that if a simple reference would continue a committee, then this commit tee would a ready In; continued, because mat ters had been referred to it yesterday. The committee lias not reported yet, and until it ?loos report, certainly all matters pertinent inav be referred to it. The committee was made to inquire into disorders in the South, and 110 one could say whether its continuance would be necessai y until after the rej ort had been sub mitted. Mr. Wood said that instead of leading to order, the ci niniitt.e was one which was calculated to pu mote disorder. He (Mr.W) would go as far ?' any g? ntliman in the House, or as fur as the (M)miiiis(iation, to promote peace and order in the South; but this was not the w ay to do it, and he protested against cent nuitig committees as agencies to promote dis >rdjr in the South. Mr. Dawes haiied wiih j >y the aim.) meein'-nt of Mr. Wood that tbe l.a':er would unite with the republicans and the administration for peace and order at the South, and it that w as done he thought peace and order would be soon at hand. Mr. Maynard (Tenn ) sr^i<I the committee re ferred to w as started tor as|*-eial purpose, ami he thought the reymrt would demonstrate not only the necessity ?f its original organization, but the necessity of continuing it." He did not want it to be thought that thispm;M>sitiou of ret', erence was a uie e side-winder to continue tlie committee.

New Yock, Dec. 5.?The Tin'* commands the President's message, but considers lioutwcll's report a most disappointing one. 7 be Herald commends the message, saying whether considered as embodyiug statesmanlike views for the prosperity of the country, or as a campaign dewument from a Presidential candi date, it is well calculated to strengthen General Grant and weaken his adversaries. The Herald does not comment) Bout well's report, and says his suggestions as to the reduction of taxes are ot a small, peddling nature. The THfrutif strenuously opposes the Presi dent s recommendation to buy the telegraphs, but finds more to commend than to condemu in the message. The World criticises the message, viewing it in the light of an electioneering document.
