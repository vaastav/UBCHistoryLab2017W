Washington, Dec. 7, 1885. The event in Washington to-day was tbc beginning of Congress. The session opened in the usual way. There were crowds in the spectators' galleries and in tlic corridors of the Capitol, while on the floor of the House there was the old time con fusion, bustle, noise, handshaking, ex change of congratulations and intro ductions. The old officers were re elected from the Speaker down. The Republicans gave a complimentary vote for Speaker to Mr. Reed of Maine. There were more than a hundred new faces among the Representatives, and the hall looked much improved hy its new carpet and freshly varnished furniture. The seal drawiug presented tbe usual amusing scene of expecta tion, suspense, and disappointment on the countenances of the fortunate and less fortunate members. The Senate chamber looked but lit tle changed since tbe last adjourn ment, except for the crape draping and floral decorations around the chair of the late Vioe President. The Senate opened as quietly as if its vacation had been only nine hours instead of nine months. Senator John Sherman was elected tu succeed Mr. Hendricks as Pres ident pro tern. Senator Logan having declined the first caucus nomination for the place. Nothing could .have been more repugnant to tbc Demo crats than tbe selection of Sherman. They would have preferred Logan, as tbe lesser evil. While Senator Logan narrow, positive partisan, bis ac tion after tbe last Presidential election was in marked contrast to tbe undig nified conduct of Mr. Blaine. And then it muat be admitted tlial while be bas been in Cdhgress during a pe riod of unparallel extravance and cor ruption, bis personal honesty bas not been questioned. Sherman is an accomplished hypo crite. While professing patriotism, he would at any moment he willing to plunge tbc country in war, if he could thereby promote bis own selfish inter ests. During bis public life in Wash ington, while engaged in no other business ostensibly, and while receiv ing the limitted pay of Congressman or Secretary Of the Treasury be has accumulated n fortune estimated at several millions. He is known to have been the brains in the Presidential theft of 1816, and to have been always an unscrupulous, plausible, ambitious, avaricious demagogue. Tbc President's message is ready for Congreas, and will probably be sent iu at to-morrow's session. Of tbe Cabinet reports sent to tbe President, that of Secretary Whitney may be mentioned as one of tbc ablest. He has found during bis incumbency, de caying dock-yards, squandered mil lions, bad management, and no ships. He scathingly reviews past methods, and bolds that tbe only remedy is in complete re-organization of tbe Navy Department. While be wastes no time m dragging to light past rascalities or in making accusations against former Secretaries, tbe plain manner in which be exposes the mismanagement, eva siens and violations of law that ex isted when he assumed control, is the most effective indictment he conld make against bis predecessors. In regard to prospective legislation it may be asserted that tbc House will first give attention to a change of it* rules. Then a bill will be presented for giving tbe Prasidatial succession to the Cabinet. It is urged tbst the temporary President, provided b; such u bill, would not be tbe people's choice, but neither would an officer elected by the Renate. Such a bill would meet the emergency better than any other plan tbst has been proposed, for it would secure the continuance hi power of tbc party aud the Admin istration elected by the people. Then there wifi be debates on tbe sliver question and a hard fight over it and the tariff. There are many theories amoAg the silver men. The West will be for silver, the East against it, and the South will be di sided. Tbe suasion has opened very quietly, bet sensations will '.-time later. Among them will probably be » scheme of Republican Senators to impeach the Genera! in connection with • the greut totephooc case.

Special Correspondence of tbe Echo : Saturday was a gala day at the Ex position, having been chosen for Now Orleans Day, when the people of this city were to testify to their support and endorsement of tbe Exposition. There was a sudden cold spell and it was nnnsually wintry, but this did not affect the people who turned out, sev eral thousand strong. The management had determined to make the day enjoyable, and they suc ceeded in tills. The attractions offered visitors were many. Firat of all, the art gallery, which alone, of all the buildings or the grounds, had re mained closed, was thrown open to tbe public. Secondly, some magnificent races were given on the Exposition race course; and finally, at night, was given the grand pyrotechnical display repre senting the destruction of Pompeii. All these were great successes in every respect. The art hall was crowd ed with people, and it was the gen eral verdict that the collection thus far excelled the display made at the Philadelphia Centennial. There arc fewer paintings by American aitists than last year, but a much larger sum ber by distinguished French and Eu ropean painters. Tbe display of bronxes was confessedly without its equal in this country. At the same time with the art gallery, the Creole exhibit which is in one of the rooms of this building, was open. Its collec tion of works of art, especially of paintings, is large; but its greatest value is tbc many historical relics, it contains illustrations of tbc early his tory of Louisiana, its discovery, ex ploration and settlement. The climax was capped at night by the display "the destruction of Pom peii." This is tlie finest pyrotechnical or firework display ever seen in tbe United States. An entire town, repre senting tbc ancient city of Pompeii, was erected on tbe borders of tbc lake, in the centre of tbe Exposition grounds. Above the town rose tbe volcano of Vesuvius. In this display, Prof. Pierce, employed some 200 or 300 persons. These attired in the dress of ancient Rome, were seen walk ing and driving through the streets of modern Pompeii. Suddenly the erup tion of tlie volcano began, and lava poured down its sides. In the height of the eruption the picture was so lifelike and striking that the younger members of tlie audience got-fiigkt eneued, and began crying. Tbe vol cano belched forth fire and smoke a hundred feet in tbe air. Down its sides ran tlie molten lava, pouring into the lake and setting fire to it. Tbe buildings caught fire and feli in with crash of timbers. Amid the flames and conflagrations, the Pompeiians wcie seen running hither and thither seeking to escape. The whole picture was very impres sive, and drew forth much applause. Tbe Exposition management have ar ranged to give it once or twice every week, and on all special and great oc casions. There will be several big celebra tions at tbc Exposition during tbc course of the next few weeks. Iowa Day will be celebrated in a couple of days; New England Day on the 22d, the anniversary of tbc landing of tbe pilgrim fathers at Plymouth Rock. January 1st will be African-American Day, when tbe negroes will assemble here iu thousands, to celebrate eman cipation. January 4th will be Creole Day, which all tbc Creoles of New Orleans and Southern Louisiana will unite in making a great event. Tbe call of tbe Echo, for contribu tions of ugricultnral products to tbe Louisiana Stale exhibit haa been pro ductive of tbe very best results, and contributions arc now received every day, that keep tbe exhibit always well supplied with fresh vegetables, fruits, cereals and other products. Tbe winter season lias now set in throughout tbe country in earnest, and as a consequence, travel has al ready begun in this direction. Tbe arrivaU of tbe first few weeks of tbe winter arc mainly from neighboring States, Mississippi and Alabama con tributing tbe most; but latterly, there bave been excursion parties from St. Louis, Chicago, Iowa and Utah; and tbe promise is for a steady improve ment with eaeb month. Tbe Exposi tion races in particular, which began this week, arc proving a great attrac tion to sporting men who are already here from all portions of tbe country. At tbe same time, Senor Emilio Martinez, Consul of Guatemala, gives notice that there will be several Urge parties of excursionists from that re public and tbe other States of Central America to attend tbe Exposition, some of whom will reach tbe Crescent City within tlie next few days. New Orleans will then be tbe common ground upon which tbe people of the three Americas will meet. There is no lack of accommodation for visitors now, and tbe rates for board and lodgings rule low, there is ao much competition in tbe business, so many engaged in it. Last year the city was badly crowded throughout tbe winter. During January and February, gentlemen and even ladies bad to double up and share their rooms with complete strangers—no pleasant matter; while around the Carnival, even this opportunity was refused them and hundreds bad to •it. up all night, or take their rest on a couch or table. There is not likely to be any such crush this year, for there is a much larger capacity for straugers than a year ago. Several large hotels have been recently open ed, and there are a greater number of boarding-houses and furnished rooms to rent. New Orleans is peculiarly a boarding-house eity. It has only! three or four first-class hotels, and a dozen second-class ones, with oceotn modations for ten or twelve thousand persons; but its boarding-booses will comfortably care for thirty thousand to - , SI peratms or more; aud with furnished rooms aud accommodations to be secured in private families, makes its total capacity something in tbc neigh borhood of sixty thousand The boarding-bousss of New Or leans, like those of other cities, vary from the f " ew ca " 1 .... fumble «ccommodateoM to I-« 1 Otkmus arc there in private j the cbetp and dirty. Yon take your chances in choosing one, unless it has j been recommended by a resident of j who knows something j Decidedly, tlie beet and mast com- j » -------„.—.a..™. ... Iw.^.„.«t J families. It has become the style here for out people, even in very good cir cumstances, to fix up an extra room or two and let it out to strangers daring the carnival season. The Exposition Management, last year, organized a Department styled the Bureau of Information and Ac commodation, for the reception and care of visitors, which has been con tinned this year by the present Man agement. That Bureau has open for tbc inspection of visitors a list of all the rooms for rent in the city, with or without board, arranged according to the prices charged by tlie day, week or month; and also furnished with ini mensc maps of tbc city showing the location of each of these rooms, so that tbe viaitor can see jnst where snd how he is located. If you inquire at tbe Bureau, which is located at the Exposition headquarters, for rooms, say at <1 or <2 a day, cither up or down town, yon will be furnished with a card containing perhaps dozen locations, and can immediately go around and pick out the one that suits you best. Col. B. T. Walshc who is head of the Bureau of Accommodation tells me that the rates of board arc fully 25 per cent, cheaper than last year, and that extra pood accommodations can be secured here for $1.25 ; if board and lodging ; and from <50 to 75 cents for a room alone. In secur ing a comfortable room in New Or leans, the great point is to get a dry one. Always, if possible, select a wooden house, not a brick or stone one. In this climate the latter are always, more or less, damp. Get one facing the south, that is looking to wards the river, for it catches the morning aun, and the morning fogs around it are soon dissipated. A front room is, of course, the best and gives one the advantage of a balcony, with which every house iu New Or leans is plentifully provided, and which is & great comfort in mild weather. Avoid a house hidden by trees or whose front is covered by ivy or other climbing plants. It is picturesque, it is true, and the people of New' Orleans have a mania for shrubbery and vines about their dwellings, but they are not healthy, are damp and always full of bugs and mosquitoes. And, if you can, get oil a paved street, for the un paved ones, which are in a great ma jority in New Orleans, are mo»t unin viting and glomy—quagmires in rainy weather, and as full of dust as the desert of Sahara when it is dry. If these precautions are followed, you can make yourself quite comfortable here. Your room will not be as well furnished, perhaps, as in a Northern or Western city, but tbe eating will be better than you will get there. Yon can be easily accommodated in tbe matter of meals. New Orleans is es sentially a city of restaurants ; they are to be found on nearly every comer, French, German and American, and with few exceptions, moderate in their prices. You can get better meals here for the price than almost any where in the country, with a bottle of wine thrown in, which yon can rest assured is pure and unadulterated. —Sometime ago we made a propo sition to our friends both in Calca sieu and Cameron to take charge of any samples or specimens of agricul tural products they would send us, and forward tbc same to the Louisiana exhibit without any further trouble or cost to them than that of sending it to ns. To this proposition no re sponce was made until quite recently. Lately wc have received and forward ed some very fine potatoes, sweet and Irish, turnips, corn and oranges. For the Ladies Department, we have only received one contribution, timt by Miss Farque, of which we speak else where. Friends, send on your exhibits and let ns send a coutribution weekly; and when it is all in we will give a list of those who have thus assisted us iu making something like a re spectable show of our agricultural and horticultural products. The Ladies will please bear in mind that they have a special invitation to contributed anything which may be of interest.

Ail the simple remedies were ap plied to alleviate the pain, but tbe place continued to grow, finally extending into my nose, from which came a yellowish discharge very offensive in character. It was also in flamed. aud annoyed me a great deal. About eight months ago I was In Atlanta, at the house of a friend, who so strongly recom mended the use of Swift's bpecifit that 1 de termined to make an effort to procure it. In this I was successful, aud began its use. The influence of the medicine at first was to some what aggravate the sore: but soon the in flammation was allayed, and 1 began to Im prove after the tiret few bottles. My general health has greatly improved. I am stronger, aud am able to do any kind of work. The cancer on my face began to décrété and the ulcer to heal, until there is not a vestige of it left.—only a little scar marks the place where it hafl been. I am ready to answer all questions relative to this cure. I have had a cancer on my lace for some years, extending from one cheek bone across the nose to tbe other.
