The general will spend tome dayi In Washington in conference with the president and the secretary of war regarding attain in Cuba. Last nght be and Mrs. Wood paid a social visit to the white house. Since his last trip to Washington, about two months ago, Gen. Wood hat traveled over practically the whole island of Cuba and be is able to give the offi ciali here a complete and Intelligent account of affairs and the people's needs. He will reiterate hit previous recommendatloni for a reduction in the dutiet on sugar and tobacco im posed by the United States govern ment. Gen. Wood believes this abso lutely necessary for the financial re habilitation of the island and to pre vent the recurrence of conditions which existed under Spanish rule. He will urge earnestly upon the president and the secretary of war that it is the duty of this govern ment, now that it has taken the Cu bans under Its protection, to encour age them to become self-supporting nnd enable them to continue the good work of maintaining the excellent conditions which have resulted from American occupation. Secretary Root yesterday addressed a communication to Kligio Ronachea, president of the convention at Ha vana, Cuba, that nominated Jiaso for president, relative to complaints that the Influence of United Slates officers was being exerted in favor of Estrada I'alma. The secretary biivs: "The rcpresentntlves of the intervening government in Cuba nre already aware that their duty requires them not merely to be strictly Impartial in the electoral contest lit Cuba, but to refrain from interfering In nny man ner whutever with the frw expres sion of the wishes of the Oilmn peo ple nt the polls. They Iinvp mit vio lated this nil? in the past end will not m the firturc. They will have nothing to do with (he electoral con test except to enforce the electoral law prescribed hv the constitutional convention nnd promulgated by the military governor on the 14th of Oc tober last. This will be done impar tially and effectively." TWO
