THURSDAY, DEC. 10, 1885- WITH SDPPLEMEHTS Make a guess for the watch, free. It is "Whist parties popular. are becoming quite The Johnson county Star is a dick nailing good paper. Moberly bad use for 1,900 feet of hose at a fire Tuesday. Read our supplements, filled with local matter. Thev are The president's message is worth reading. This is something new. The Pacific (Missouri) Herald is a new exchange. It is a neat and clean family paper. The fight on Senator Cockrell will simply consolidate his friends. Only this and nothing more. The Troy board of trade is alive and kicking. It got off on the wrong foot but is now booming. There is only one applicant for the Mexico postoffice. "What became of the rast of the boys, we don't know. The mugwumps have joined the Greenbackers, and the new "party" can hold its convention in an one horse omnibus. The Moberly Monitor has tied its tow-line on to the branch pen. It deserves to win. Meberly is a daisy town the twin sister of Mexico. In drawing seats in the house of congress Hon. J. E. Hutton of this district drew a seat on the speaker's right, back near the lobby. He is near Burnes, Clardy and Hatch, all of Missouri. Disappointed office-seekers all over the state are finding fault with the appointments of Cleveland in Missouri. We should think this very bad taste. He may have made mis takes but they are few. The St. Louis Chronicle and St- Louis Globe-Democrat differ. One says ear congressman is confined to his room with vertigo and the other says it is hay fever. Great papers will differ. We find the following in a telegram to a St. Louis paper of Monday "Representative Hutton is under the weather. He had a slight attack of vertigo to-day." This is greatly to be regretted as congress was to have convened on Monday. Correct, as Usual. A paper that has not the courage to condemn wrong in its own party is not a truo exponent of honest Democratic sentiment We believe above all things in keeping our own household pure. Mexico Intelligen cer. "Sonr Grapes." For reasons that we consider good we leave out the "sour grapes" arti cle sent us by a Democrat in regard to kicking made in a wholesale man ner against the appointments of Cleveland in this state The article may er may not be true. The pub lishing of it now could do no good. Cleveland needs no backbone. He knows his business and "disappointed office-seekers'' will not be able to bias him. "Much Credit to Bob White." We see by the Mexico Ledger that ' the water works are about completed in that city. Much credit is due Bob White for this enterprise, for he has been hammering away in the Ledgu for some time past with re ference to the matter. You can Bay what you please about newspaper gab being all bosh, it helps along wonderfully in these public enter prises Marshall News. Two Supplements. Tbe Ledger this week at an extra ordinary expense furnishes its read ers with two supplements free. One contains the president's message and ether good reading matter. The other is filled with tbe best local mat ter and live ads. The Ledges at ibis time of year is of course -with ads on-account of iU i&tge cir culation but under no circumstances does ita proprietor limit the amount of reading matter. Watches, Diamonds. Clocks, Rings, It is a shame that a live little city like Mexico should have any drones, clams or dogs in the manger, but it is a. fact. There are a few such in but Mex5co fihould be .tlked straight- The men we wish to stir J up are those who are able to assist with time and money in booming Mexico. We fear they want to en joy all the advantages but spend no money. When a sidewalk to the cemetery is to be laid or a park fence is to be erected or the poor to he fed or buried, or a Board of Trade to be organized, or money to be subscribed to get a manufacturing establishment, or electric light to be paid for, or one thousand and one other things nec- essarv to a live town to be looked after, some of our citizens are inva riably conspicuous by their absence. This is not right. It is not fair for a few people to do all the work and spend all the money while others who are amply able, stand around sneerin, and sulking, and at the same time get all the advantages derived from the enterprises. The Ledger does not favor boy cotting but we do think such busi ness (?) men should be hauled over the coals. Their proper place is in the grave yard. They are no good on the earth to a town. They would kill any town. Except for the vital ity Mexico has this class of men to day would be playing marbles where Hardin College is or ''shucking" corn where the court house stands. Wake up, gentlemen. Get to the front. If you are too penurious that's the word to give aaything, for heaven's sake don't discourage others and spend your time in throw ing cold water on every enterprise spoken of. Mexico has got to get there. If the old fogies and cranks won't assist we must get there any way if we have to plow them under. Mexico is getting a move an herself and is bound to shine. You can t keep a good town down, no matter how you handicap it. Mexico has many liberal men men who help every enterprise men who give more than they can afford. Our remarks are intended for a few chronic kickers, who, although able, and reap the benefits, never spend a cent unless they are sure of getting back two cents before they shut their eyes. Do they ever ask themselves, "Will anyone be at our funeral because they are sorry we are gone ?" No, sir, the brass band will be out that day. la Good Shape! We are glad to get tbe following in conservation with Rev. T. J. Wheat, the Presiding Elder, who was here holding quarterly meeting on last Sabbath. The Liberty street Methodist Episcopal church has paid for pastoral support for the past quarter $223.00. The church building is in good repair and the Society is in a good and growing spiritual condition. They have no church debt, but have nearly $1,200 in notes and available funds to invest in parsonage property. The invest ment will likely be made in the near future. Tbis, the Presiding Elder said, is a good showing. We cheer fully give place to these reliable facts and wish their church unbounded suc cess. One Price. The Ledger has one price for ad vertising the same to all business men. One page one week (except local page) $15 ; one-half page one week (except local page) $30 ; one quarter page one week (except local page) $20; one-eighth of page one week (except local page) $10. Of course, to regular advertisers who are patrons the year 'round, we make a slight reduction. Business is business, and we carry no man's ad vertisement for less money than another. We know our space is worth the price asked ; if you don't want it don't take it. See sworn statement of circulation. The Ledges' s prices are governed by its circulation. We don't claim to carry ads any cheaper than any one else. We charge according to the quality of tbe goods. The gas works ef Kansas City were blown up Tuesday night."-Loss $150,000. It will take three months ita get the works in operation. . The saint and sinner both speak under their breath when they slip up on the street and middle aged.
