2 Preparedness Is Washington. Txte. 7. Following !(f the message of President Wilson deliv ered today at a joint sesaion of the sen ate and bona: Gentlemen of tbe Congress-Since I Jant bad tba priviiega of addressing yon on tbe state of tie Union the war of nations on tbe other side of the sea, which bad then eniy begun to disclose it portentous proportions, has extend ed its threatening and sinister scope nntll it has swept within its flame some portion of every quarter of ths globe, not excepting our own hemi sphere, baa altered the whole face of International affairs, and now present a proa pert of reorganization and re construction such as statesmen and people bave never been called upon to attempt before. Tbe president tells how this country practiced neutrality and declare that be hopes that when tbe time come for readjustment and recuperation this country will i of infinite service Re- ; ferrlng to Central and South American prooiems, me president, oeciares tnnt we should rets In unabated the spirit which has inspired as throughout the whola life of our government and which was so frankly put into words by President Monroe. ' We have been put to the test in the ca.!a of .Mexico, aud we bare stood the test Whether we have benefited Mex Po by lAe course we have pursued re mains to be seen. Her fortunes are in bcr own .hands. But we hare at least proved that we will not tnke advan tage of bet in her distress and under take to tapnae tipo a her an order and government of our own choosing. Lib erty is often a fierce and intractable thing, to whit no 'ifeounds can be set sod to which no lwmids of a few tnen'a choosing ought ever to be set Every American wtr has drunk at the true fountains of principle and tra dition must subscribe without reserva tion to the high doctrine of the Vir ginia bill of rights, which in the great days in which our government was set up was everywhere among us accept ed as the creed of free men. That doc trine is. "That government is or ought to be instituted for tbe common bene fit, protection and security of the peo ple, nation or commiauity;" that "of nil the various modes uud forms of government, that Is tbe best which Is capable of producing tl" greatest de . gree of happiness and safety and is most effectually secured against the danger of maladministration, aud that wben any government fchall be found inadequate or contrary to. thtse pur poses a majority of the eominuuity hath an Indubitable, inalienable and Indefeasible right to rtifor.ni, alter or alHiUsb.it iu such manner as shall be . Judged most conducive to the public Tieid." We have unhesitatingly ap plied that heroic principle to the case of Mexico and now hopefully await the rebirth of the troubled republic, which had so much of which to purge itself and so little sympathy from any outside quarter in tbe radical but nec essary process. We will aid and lie friend Mexico, but we will not coerce her, and our course with regard to her ought to be sufficient proof to all Amer ica that we seek no political suzerainty or selfish control. "one of Empire's Spirit The moral is that the states of Amer ica are not hostile rivals, but co-op-crating friends, and that their grow ing sense of community of interest, alike in matters political and in mat ters economic, is likely to give them a new significance as factors lu interna tional affairs and in tbe political his tory of the world. It presents them a3 In a very deep and true sense a unit in world aflnirs, spiritual partners, standing together because thinking to Bother, quick with common sympathies and common ideals. Separated, they are subject to all the cross currents of the confused politics of a world of bos tile rivalries; united in spirit and pur pone, they cannot be disappointed of their peaceful destiny. This is pan-Americanism. It has none of the spirit of empire in it. It is the embodiment, the effectual embodiment, of the spirit of law and independence and liberty and mutual service. , . The president calls attention to the Foes to WW ffsr cToiiAcn nsoTfcyla Wahlgton recently of representatives of the pan-American republics and says that economic ad justment la inevits bte in tbe next gen eration. J."e one who really comprehends the spirit of tbe great eople for whom we are appointed to ssik can fail to per ceive that their pussloa is for peace, their gonitis best displayed in the prac tice of the arts of j eace. Great democ racies are not belli! jereut They do not seek or desire wsr. Their thought Is of Individual liberty and of tbe free labor that suppo.rts life and the un censored thought; that quickens it Conquest and dorainloo are cot in our reckoning or agreeable to our princi ples. But Just beeause we demand un molested develop aent sod the ondis turbed government of our own lives upon onr own pi ineiples of right and liberty, we res?nt, from whatever quarter it may cq me, the aggression we ourselves will net practice. We insist upon security in prosecuting our self chosen lines of national development We do more tha n that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national d f'veiopment to tbe inci dents and movements of affairs which affect only ours eires. We feel it wher ever there is a i wople that USm to walk in these difficult: paths of independence and right. From the first we have made common cause with all partisans of liberty on th as side the sea and bave deemed it as important that onr neigh bors should be free from all outside domination as that we ourselves should be; have set America aside us a whole for the uses of Independent nations and politkMl freemen. Out of such thoughts grow all our policite. We nsgard war merely as a means of asserting- tbe rights of a peo ple against aggression. And we are as fiercely jealous of coercive or dicta torial power witliin our own nation as of aggression from without. We will not maintain a standing army ex cept for uses which are as necessary in times of pear as In times of war. Suggests Broad Plan. But war has never been a mere mat ter of men awl guns. It is a thing of disciplined might If our citizens are ever to fifrht effectively upon a sudden summons, they must know bow modern fighting Ss done, and what to do when the summons comes to render themselves immediately avail able and imiioediately effective. And the government must be their servant in this matter, must supply them with the training tiley need to take care of themselves and of it. The military arm of their ifovernnur'nt which they will not ailow to direct them, they may properly use is serve them and make their independence secure, and not their own independence merely, but the rights al:o of those with whom they have made common cause, should they also lie put in Jeopardy. They must be .fitted to play the great role in the wo.'Jd. and particularly iu this hemisphere, for which they are quali fied by principle and by chastened am bition to piny. It is with these ideals in mind that the plans of the department of war for more adequrate nntiouul defense were conceived which will be laid before you, and which I urge you to sanction and put into effect as soon as they can be propprly scrutinized and discussed. They seem to me the essential first steps, and they seem to me for the present sufficient. They contemplate an increase of tbe standing force of the regular army from its present strength of 5,023 offi cers and 102,985 enlisted men of all services to a strength of 7,136 officers and 134.70T enlisted men, or 141,843 ail told, all services, rank and file, by the addition of fifty-two companies of coast artillery, fifteen companies of en gineers, ten regiments of infantry, four regiments of field artillery and four aero sqraadrons, besides 750 officers re quired for a great variety of extra service, especially the all important duty of training the citizen force of which I shall presently speak. 702 non commissioned officers for service in drill, recruiting and the like and the necessary quota of enlisted men for I the quartermaster corps, the hospital Health There can be no real health so long as the Stomach, Liver and Bowels are in a weak ened condition and are unable to perform their daily functions.

Tbee are the additions Becessary to render the army adequate for its present du ties, duties which it has to perform not only upoa our own continental coast and borders and at our interior army posts, but also ia the Philippines, in the Hawaiian Islands, at the isth mus and ia Porto Rico. By way of making the country ready to assert some part of its real power promptly and upon a larger scale should occasion arise tbe plan also contemplates supplementing tbe army by a force ef 40 disciplined citi zens, raised In increments of 133,000 a year throughout a period of three years. This it Is proposed to do by a process of enlistment under which the serviceable men of the country would be asked to bind themselves to serve with the colors for purposes of train ing for short periods throughout three years and to come to the colors at call at any time throughout an additional furlough" period of three years. This force of 400.000 men would be pro vided with personal accouterments as fast as enlisted and their equipment for the field made ready to be supplied nt env time. Thev would be assem bled for training at stated intervals at convenient places in association with suitable nnits of tbe regular army. Their period of annual trnihing would not necessarily exceed two months in the year. The president says it Is up to tbe patriotic young men of the country to respond to this call. For Greater Navy. The program which will be laid be fore you by the secretary of the navy is similarly conceived. It involves only a shortening of the time within which plans long matured shall be carried out, but it does make definite and ex plicit a program whiei has heretofore been only implicit, held in tbe minds of the committees on naval affairs and disclosed in the debates of the two houses, but nowhere formulated or for mally adopted. It seems to me very clear that it will be to the advantage of the country for the eongress to adopt a comprehensive plan for putting the navy upon a final footing of strength and efficiency and to press that plan to completion withiu the next five years. We have always looked to tbe navy of the country as our first and chief line of defense; we bave always seen it to be our manifest course of prudence to be strong on the seas. Year by year we have been creating a navy which now ranks very high in deed among the navies of the maritime nations. We should now definitely de termine how 'we shall complete what we bave begun and bow soon. The program to be laid lw?for? you contemplates the construction within five years of ten battleships, six battle cruisers, ten scout cruisers, fifty de stroyers, fifteen fleet submarines, eighty-five coast submarines, four gun boats, one hospital ship, two ammuni tion ships, two fuel oil ships and one repair ship. It is proposed that of this number we shall the first year provide for the construction of two battleships, two battle cruisers, three scout cruisers, fifteen destroyers, five fleet submarines, twenty -five coast submarines, two gun boats and one hospital ship; the second year two battleships, one scout cruiser, ten destroyers, four fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat and one fuel oil ship; tbe third year two battleships, one "battle cruiser, two scout cruisers, five destroyers, two fleet submarines and fifteen coast subma rines; the fourth year two battleships, two battle cruisers, two scout cruisers, ten destroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one ammuni tion ship and one fuel oil ship, and the fifth year two battleships, one bat tle cruiser, two scout ernisers, ten de stroyers, two fleet submarines, fifteen coast submarines, one gunboat, one am munition ship and one repair ship. The secretary of the navy is asking also for tbe Immediate addition to the personnel of the navy of 7,500 sailors. 2,500 apprentice seamen and 1.500 ma rines. This increase would be suffi cient to care for the ships which are to be completed within the fiscal year 101" and also for the number of men which must be put in training to man the ships which will be completed early in 191S. It is also necessary that tbe number of midshipmen at the Na val academy at Annapolis should be increased by at least 300 in order that the force of officers should be more rapidly added to, and authority is ask ed to appoint, for engineering duties only, approved graduates of engineer ing colleges, and f6r service in the avi ation corps a certain number of men taken from civil life. If this full program should be carried out we should have bnilt or building in 1921, according to the estimates of sur vival and standards of classification followed by the general board of the department, aa effective navy consist ing of 27 battleships of the first line, 6 battle cruisers, 25 battleships of tie second line, 10 armored cruisers, 13 scout cruisers, 5 first class cruisers, 3 second class cruisers, 10 third class cruisers, 108 destroyers. IS fleet sub marines, 157 coast submarines, 6 mon itors, 20 gunboats, 4 supply ships, 15 fuel ships, 4 transports, 3 tenders to torpedo vessels, S vessels of special types and two ammunition ships. This would be a uavy fitted to our needs and worthy of onr traditions. But armies and instruments of war are only part of what has to be con sidered if we are to consider the su preme matter of national self aufficien cy and security in all its aspects. There are other great matters which will be thrust upon our attention whether we will or not There is, for example, a very pressing question of trade and aMppin involved In this rreat problem of national adequacy. It is necessary for many weighty rea son of national efficiency and devel opment that we should have great merchant marine. The great merchant fleet we once used to mate us rich. 

ARGUS. TUESDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1915. Theme Photo by American Press Association. PRESIDENT WILSON'S LATEST PICTURE. (From snapshot taken on Nov. ;6.) used to carry our flag into every sea, and who were tile pride and often the bulwark of the nation, we have almost driven out of existence by inexcusable neglect and indifference and by a hope lessly blind and provincial policy of so called economic protection. It is high time we repaired our mistake and resumed our commercial independence on the seas. With a view to meeting these press ing necessities of our commerce and availing ourselves at tbe earliest possi ble moment of tbe present unparalleled opportunity of linking tbe two Ameri cas together in bonds of mutual inter est and service, an opportunity which may never return again if we miss it now, proposals will be made to the present congress for the purchase or construction of ships to be owned and directed by the government similar to those made to the last congress, but modified in some essential particulars. I recommend these proposals to you for your prompt acceptance with the more confidence because every month that has elapsed since the former pro posals were made has made tbe ne- j cessity for sucb action more and more mamiestiy imperative. Tbat need was then foreseen. It is now acutely felt and everywhere realized by those for whom trade is waiting, but who can find no conveyance for their goods. I am not so much interested iu the par- ! ticulars of the program as I am In taking immediate advantage of the great opportunity which awaits us if ve will but act iu this emergency. In this matter, as in all others, a spirit of common comisel should prevail, and out of it should come an early solu tion of this pressing problem. - Foliey in (he Philippines.

The president refers to tbe increased cost of carrying out the plans for tbe armed forces of the nation and tells of the fiscal problems confronting the government On tbe 30th of June last there was an available balance In the general fund of toe treasury of tlO4.170.10j.75. The total estimated receipts for the year 3910, cn tbe assumption thst tbe emergency revenue measure passed by tbe last congress 'Will not be extended beyond its present limit the Slst of December, 1915, and that the present duty of 1 cent per pound on ugar will I discontinued after the 1st of May, 1918, will be $670,365,500. The balance of June last and these estimated rev enues come therefore to a grand total of $774,335,1505.78. The total estimated disbursements for the present fiscal year, including twenty-five millions for the Pauama canaL twelve millions for probable deficiency appropriations and iriO.OOO for miscellaneous debt redemp tions, will be $753,891,000. and the bal ance in tbe general fund of the treas ury will be reduced to $2O,f44,605.78. The emergency revenue act if contin ued beyond its present time limitation would produce during tbe half year then remaining about forty-one mil lions. The duty of 1 cent per pound on sugar if continued would produce during the two months of the fiscal year remaining after the 1st of May about fifteen millions. These two suras, amounting together to fifty-six mil lions, if added to tbe revenues of the second half of tbe fiscal year would yield tbe treasury at the end of the year an available balance of $76,644, 605.7S. The additional revenues required to carry out the program of military and naval preparation of which I have spoken would, as at present estimated, be for the fiscal year 1917 593,800,000. Those figures, taken with the figures for tbe present fiscal year which I have already given, disclose our finan cial problem for tbe year 1917. As suming that the taxes imposed by the emergency revenue act and tbe pres ent duty on sugar are to be discontin ued and that the balance at tbe close of the present fiscal year will be only S20.644.6O5.7S. tbflt tbe disbursements for the Panama canal will again be about $25,000,000 and that tbe addi tional expenditures for the army and navy are authorized bv the congress. the deficit in the general fund of the treasury on the 30th of June. 1917. will be nearly $233,000,000. To this sum at least S-jO.OOO.OOO should be add ed to represent a safe working balance for the treasury and $12,000,000 to in clude tie usual deficiency estimates In 1017. and thjje additions would make a total Ciflclt cf some $207,000,000. If the present tares should be continued throughout this year and the next however, tbere would be a balance ic the treasury of some $70,000,000 at the end of the present fiscal year aud a deficit at the end of the next year of only some $50,000,000, or, reckoning in $(2,000,000 for deficiency appropria tions and a safe treasury balance at the end of the year, a total deficit of some $112,000,000. Tbe obvious moral of the figures is that it is a plain coun sel of prudence to continue all of the present taxes or their equivalents and confine ourselves to the problem of providing $112,000,000 of new revenue rather than $297,000,000. How shall we obtain the new rev enue? We are frequently reminded that there are many millions of bonds which tbe treasury is authorized under existing law to sell to reimburse tbe sums paid out of current revenues for the construction of the Panama canal, and it is true that bonds for the amount of $222,432,000 are now avail able for that purpose. Prior to 1913 $13S.000,000 of these bonds had ac tually been sold to recoup the expendi tures at tbe isthmus, and now con stitute a considerable item of the pub lic debt But I for one do not believe that the people of this country approve of postponing the payment of thelr bills. Borrowing money is shortsight ed finance. It can be justified only when permanent things are to- be ac- j complished which many generations I will certainly benefit by and which it seems hardly fair that a single genera- J tion should pay for. The objects we j are now proposing to spend money for cannot be so classified, except in the j sense that everything wisely done may I be said to be done in tbe interest of ! posterity as well as in our own. It seems to me a clear dictate of pru dent statesmanship and frank finance that in what we are now, I hope, about to undertake we should pay as we go. The people of the country are entitled to know Jnst what burdens of taxation they are to carry and to know from the outset now. Tbe new bills should be paid by Internal taxation. Secret Foes Should Be Crushed. The president says that the precise reckonings of the problem to be met are set forth In the report of tbe secre tary of the treasury. I have spoken to yon today, gentle men, upon a single theme, the thor ough preparation of the nation to care for its own security and to make sure of entire freedom to play the impar tial role in this hemisphere and in tbe world which we all believe to have been providentially assigned to it I have had in my mind no thought of any Immediate or particular danger arising out of our relations with other nations. We are at peace with all the nations cf tbe world, and there is rea son to hope that no question in con troversy between this and other gov ernments will lead to any serious breach of amicable relations, grave as some differences of attitude and policy have been and may yet turn out to be I am sorry to say that the gravest threats against onr national peace and safety hare been uttered within our own borders. .There are citizens of the trmted Statea, ji blMa t0 under other flags, but welcomed under our generous naturaiiiartoa laws to to full freedom and opportunity of A met ica. who hay pound the poison of dis- national lire, trbo bave sought to bring tU authority aud good name of our government into contempt, to destroy onr Industries wherever they thought it effective for their vindktire pur poses to strike at them aud to debase our politics to the uses of foreign in trigue. Their number is not great as compared with the whole number of those sturdy hosts by which our na tion has been enriched in recent gen erations out of virKe foreign stocks but it is great enough to hare brought deep disgrace upon us and to have made it necessary that we should promptly make use of processes of law by which we may be purged of tbeir corrupt distempers. America never witnessed anything like this before. It never dreamed it possible that men sworn Into Its own citizenship, men drawn out of great free stocks such as supplied some of the best and strongest elements of that little, but how heroic, nation that in a high day of old staked its rery life to free itself from every entanglement that had darkened the fortunes of tbe older nations and set up a new stand ard here that men of such origins and such free choices of allegiance would ever turn in malign reaction against the government and people who had welcomed and nurtured them and seek to make this proud country once more a hotbed of European passion. A lit tle while ago such a thing would bave seemed incredible. Because it was in credible we made no preparation for it We would have been almost ashamed to prepare for it as if we were suspicions of ourselves, our own comrades and neighbors! Bot the ugly and incredible thing has actually come about, and we are without adequate federal laws to deal with it I urge you to enact such laws at the earliest possible moment and feel that in doing so I am urging you to do nothing less than save tbe honor and self respect of the nation. Such creatures of pas sion, disloyalty and anarchy must be crushed out They are not many, but they are infinitely malignant, and the hand of our power should close over tflm at once. They bave formed plots to destroy property, they bave entered Into conspiracies against the neutrality of tbe government, they have sought to pry Into every confidential trans action of the government in order to serve Interests alien to our own. It Is possible to deal with these things very effectually. I need not suggest the terms in which they may be dealt with. I wish that it could be said that only a few men, misled by mistaken senti ments of allegiance to tbe governments under which they were born, bad been guilty of disturbing tbe self possession and misrepresenting the temper and principles of the country during tbeso days of terrible war, when it would seem that every man who was truly an American would instinctively make it his duty and his pride to keep the scales of judgment even and prove him self a partisan of no nation but his own. But it cannot There are some men among us aud many resident abroad who, though born aud bred in the United States and calling them selves Americans, have so forgotten themselves and their honor as citisens ns to put their passionate sympathy with one or tbe other side in the great European conflict above their regard for the peace and dignity of tbe United States. They also preach and practice disloyalty. No laws, I suppose, can reach corruptions of the mind and heart, but I should not speak of others without also speaking of these and ex pressing the even deeper humiliation and scorn which every self possessed and thoughtfully patriotic American must feel when he thinks of them and of the discredit they ore daily bringing upon us. What Is more important Is that the industries and resources of tbe country should be available and ready for mobilization, it Is the more impera tively necessary, therefore, that we should promptly devise means for do pg what we have not yet donerrthat OP?

Many conditions about which w have repeatedly legislated are being altered from decade to decade, it it evident, under our very eyes and ars likely to chsnge even more rapidly and more radically In the days Imme diately ahead of us when peace has returned to tbe world and the nations of Europe once more take up their tasks of commerce and Industry with the energy of those who must bestir themselves to build anew. To fleet Railroad Problem. In the meantime may Tmake this .iirrtroaHnn Tho tffl nsnortrttlon nroh. lem is an exceedingly serious and pressing one in this country. There has from time to time of late been res son to fear that our railroads would not much longer be able to cope with it successfully, as at present equipped and co-ordlnnted. I suggest tbat it, would be wise to provide for a com mission of inquiry to ascertain by a thorough canvass of tbe whole ques tion whether our laws as at present framed and administered are as serv iceable as they might be in the solu tion of the problem. It is obviously a problem tbat lies at the very foun dation of our efficiency as a people. Such an toqntry ought to draw out every circumstance and opinion worth considering, and we need to know all sides of the matter If we mean to do anything in the field of federal leg islation. No one, I am sure, would wish to take any backward step. The reguls tion of tbe railway of the country hy federal commission has had admirable results and has fully Justified the hopes and expectations of those by whom the policy of regulation was originally proposed. The question is not. What should we undo? It is whether there is anything else we caa do that would supply us with effective means, in the very process of regu lation, for bettering the conditions un der which tbe railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole, ft. seems to me that it might be tbe patt of wisdom, therefore, before further legislation in this field Is attempted, to look at the whole problem of co-ordination and efficiency in the full light of a fresh assessment of circumstance and opinion, as a guide to dealing with 1 the several parts of it For what we are seeking now, what In my mind is tbe single thought of this message, is national efficiency sad security. We serve a great Bation. We should serve it in tha spirit of its peculiar genius. It is the genius of common men for self government In dustry, Justice, liberty and peace. We should see to it that it lacks no In strument, no facility or vigor of law, to make It sufficient to plsy its part wttb energy, safety and assured suc cess. In this we are no psrtlsHns bat heralds and prophets of a new age. The Irish Sea. The English channel is nowhere more than 900 feet deep. The Irish sea is 2,130 feet.
