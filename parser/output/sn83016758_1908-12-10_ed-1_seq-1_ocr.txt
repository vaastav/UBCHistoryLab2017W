A FORCEFUL MESSAGE President Roosevelt's Annual Mes- sage to Congress Considered to be His Masterpiece. Topics of National Import Are Taken Up in a Firm Manner and Given Due Attention. President Roosevelt's last'annual message to congress was read to the senate and house on Tuesday. Of all the communications which he has made to the American people this may be regarded as the most able. It shows the result of his years of experi ence in the public service. Each of the topics to which the president has called public attention from time to time are taken up and, while he suggests no new reforms, there is evinced many directions an arrival at conslusions not ex pressed in previous messages. Presi dent Roosevelt has at all times been greatest as a teacher of morality, and along these lines the message dwells hnrmnnv with Ms in harmony with hi public utterances He, however, makes more clear than ever the growing temperance of his ideas and shows that he stands on that sane middle ground which is removed from both the radical and reaction ary. Among other things the president urges that corporate finances be supervised by the government and their securities made reasonably safe for the small investor: prohibition of child labor, diminution of woman labor, shorter hours and better con ditions for all labor, and encourage ment of industrial education: pro hibition of stock watering, and of stock gambling, if possible: progres sive inheritance tax on large fortunes, that the tax burden of the small man may be lightened and a premium be placed upon thrift, hard work and energy. These represent in a large way the reforms he has tried to bring about, and it will be found that the whole message leads back to them from whatever collateral topic it may treat. IX 

WRONG HOUSE Li. C. Hummel Awakened by Footsteps in His Bedroom. Early Sunday morning Li. C. Hum mel was awakened by footsteps in his bedroom and in a stentorian voice asked the intruder's business. "I'm doing no harm, sir," responded the fellow, I merely want to find my way out of here." ''You do, eh?"answered Mr. Hummel, striking a match and -grasping a revolver. "I'll attend to you in about two seconds." When the light shone upon the visitor Mr. Hum mel recognized him and knew he was no burglar. Calling him by name he asked the reason for this clandestine visit and was told that it was merely a mistake. '"I guess I must have thought I was climbing the hotel stairs. When I awoke I found myself in that room (the dining room) sit ting on a chair, and I couldn't tell for the life of me where I was at! I'm glad, mighty glad, that I found myself in the house of a friend." -'That's all right," said Mr. Hummel, laughingly, '-but you had a narrow escape, old chap. Had I not recog nized you your life would have been snuffed out instanter." The noctur nal intruder was then directed how to find his way to the street. It appears that the Hummel door had been left open for Gus. the saus age maker, and that the visitor arrived before he reached home, took a seat in the dining room and went to sleep. Gus, upon entering the house, locked the door, and the visitor, wak ing up later, discovered that he was in some place unfamiliar to him and that the door was locked. Three Kibs Fractured. Mr. LaBelle, an old gentleman re siding in Greenbush, sustained a fracture of three ribs on Saturday in -consequence of a peculiar accident. He was proceeding to Princeton and occupied a light wagon in company odfch the Pradette brothers, when the horse elevated its heels and caught one of its feet in the shaft in such position that it could not release it. The horse became frightened and ran off as fast. as it. coulid under the cir cumstances, but it did nob proceed far before the wagon turned over and threw the occupants out. Mr. La Belle was, however, the only one injured. Dr. Annitage was summoned and re duced the fractures. Os-wa-gat-chle dab.

Make I An All Iron Bridge No definite conclusion has been ar rived at with reference to the new bridge, which is in process of erection across the Rum river south of the vil lage. We understand it will reequire kbout SI,000 in addition to the amount i,lready appropriated to complete a ubstantial all-iron bridge, ani the supervisors of Princeton have ex pressed their willingness to shoulder half of that amount. We do not care to press the matter, but it does seem as if the county should be willing to stand the other half, in view of the fact that the committee of acquiesced the con templated. To be sure the bridge can be completed after a fashiontwo thirds iron and one-third woodfor the amount agrepd upon in the con tact with the builders. But it will be a sorry looking structure and will not be permanent. We sincerely hope the county commissioners will co-operate with the town supervisors and give us a bridge that will be a credit to all concerned. The county will not be called upon again in the next decade to assist in building a ^bridge in the extreme south end of the county, and the tax-payers of the village of Prince ton will cheerfully contribute their share toward road and bridge im provements elsewhere in the county. ccommissioners mmissl nhii .n,.onM change of location as originally acquiescedthe icounty f er Birthd ay Surprise While Gorge Staples was toasting his toes and reading the Sunday paper on Saturday evening a number of his friends and neighbors quietly entered his home by the back door. George heard the sound of feet stealthily ap proaching and, looking up, was sur prised to find the room filled with people who had come to give him the glad hand upon the occasion of his forty-eighth birthday anniversary. As the date of his birth did not arrive until the following day the visitors decided to wait and play cards in the interim. One minute after midnight George was compelled to make a speech, and following this came re freshments. The party shortly there after disbanded after an enjoyable evening's entertainment. Farewell Party The Pythian Sisters gave a card party in honor of Mrs. A. S. Mark at her home on Tuesday afternoon. Re freshments were served at 5 o'clock.

The Pap er That Has Readers We are requested by a man who has lost a chestnut three and one half year old mare weighing 1,000 pounds to ask the readers of the only inde pendent weekly paper you all should read and study from a to and not only read but subscribe for it, to let the editor of this department know who has taken up such an animal. Ronneby Dept., Foley Independent. A four line advertisement in the Union, the paper that is read by almost everybody within a 20 mile radius of Princeton, located the mare. James Kenely of Greenbush, who is and has been a reader of this paper since 1876, saw the advertisement in the Union and notified the owner where he could find his mare. It pays to advertise in the Union. People read the Union. Firm Will Change Hands. Articles of incorporation of A. E. Allen & Co. appear in this issue. The new firm has purchased the stock-in trade of E. B. Anderson and will take possession of the business on Janu ary 1, 1909. Algot E. Allen, Alice Allen and Albin Allen are the incor porators and the capital stock is $50,000. A. E. Allen, who will be the resident manager, has had many years experience in the general mercantile business and there is no apparent reason why he should not make as great a success as his predecessor, Mr. Anderson, who is a thorough businessman.

County Chairman in Dispatch. $- Not So Weak At the time Robert C. Dunn was de feated for governor he was regarded by some as a weak candidate. The republican party was divided. This year the party was united, yet Mr. Jacobson received but 7,000 more votes than Mr. Dunn. In view of the increase in population Mr. Dunn was as strong as Mr. Jacobson.Fergus Falls Journal. A Ridiculous Farce. The bible says that the whale swal lowed Jonah. Politically applied it might be ren dered that Jonah swallowed the whale. That would be just as easy to be lieve as the reports made and filed by some of the candidates for office, con gressional and otherwise, as to the amount of money that they paid out for political expenses while candidates for office.Fairmont Independent. Why Not Put Joel in Control? Joel P. Heatwole stoutly maintains that the republican organization in this state is in the almost absolute control of the 'triple alliance," the railroad interests, the brewers' com bine and the steel trust, and he says he is going to keep right on fighting until the representatives of these inter ests who control the party machinery are put down and out. Go it. old boy. the wind's with you!Barnes ville Record-Review. Our Beautiful Primary Law. The benefits of the primary election law have proved a deceit and an injury to the prevailing party. Until politics reach a higher plane and men are less selfish it will always work to the in jury of the party in the majority. This law needs amending, modifying and changing materially, or failing in that, it should be repealed, or the republican party in this state and the majority party in any other state will become the minority party.Fairmont Independent. Preparing for the Usual Raid. The public institutions of the state are preparing for the usual raid on the public strong box when the legis lature meets, and. as usual, are by no means modest in their demands. There are republicans and democrats, machines and organizations, political bosses and near bosses, but none of them are in it compared to the public institutions of the state when it comes to the distribution of any surplus that happens to be in the treasury.Martin County Independent.

Farmers Should Stand Together. Central creameries now control Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma. Mis souri, Montana, Utah, Idaho, Texas, practically all of South Dakota and most of North Dakota and southern Iowa. Inroads are being made on Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio as well as western Minneesota and eastern and southern Wisconsin. The farmers of this state should stand to gether as one man as the life of the dairy business rests with them. Let the business be absorbed by the large central creameries and the profit which makes the dairying business worth while will be absorbed by the central izes, leaving the farmer to work for the fun of it.Litchfield Review. Moos. One of the Responsible Republicans. Charles J. Moos, one of the popular St. Cloud boys, is the latest victim of the democratic machine. Mr. Moos must step down and out, not because he is not competent, honest and faith ful, but because he is a republican. Gov. Johnson, when talking to Mr. Moos' republican friends, preached the holy joys of non-partizan voting. When it comes to holding office under Gov. Johnson, his machine has no use for any man who is not subservi ent to it. Even so able a democrat as Charley Vassaly of Little Falls was ousted from the state board of equalization because he was indepen dent enough to insist that the big cor porations should come across with their share of taxes. And some thousands of republican voters are responsible for this vicious dem ocratic machine.St. Cloud Journal Press.

He would not be without it for fifty times its weight in gold. Will sends regards to his friends. A Favorite Sundae. A college favorite sundae for eve ning gatherings is merely plain vanilla ice cream served in glass cups with chocolate sauce, into which chopped nuts have been stirred, turned over it.
