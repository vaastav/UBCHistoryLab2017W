Descending the scale of population, wo find a large class of places likeAugusta, Me., Chilicothc, Ohio, Hudson, N. V., Hud son City, S.J., Ogdensburgh, X Y., Spring field, Ohio, Sx., all smaller than Burlington, (though over 7,000 population,) but enjoy ing city organizations, and flourishing under them. And still smaller cities of 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 inhabitants, arc scattered over the west by scores. Have all these made ttmiitake in adopting city organizations ? If you ask their citizens, they will tell you, in variably, that they think not ; that they inanagcthcirafiUirs more economically and far more efficiently, so, than they could with a town organization like ours, and that their city organizations have conduced greatly to the growth and prosperity of their places. What their experience has been, we cannot doubt. would be ours. Hut it is not neces sary to depend Hjain the cxticricnce of others.

That there is such a point nobody will deny ; nobody will main tain that the affairs of Boston or Xew York, or any place of 50,000 inhabitants, can be managed by Tbtra Medina. In the city organixition, the citizens dele gate to their representatives, who form th city government, theduty of managing their allairs. And this is perfectly democratic : nobody thinks it is. despotic to have our State affairs managed by a Governor, Senate and House of Kcprestntativcs, chosen by the peo ple, instead ol by a mass meeting of the citi zens of the State, presided over by a modera tor. And for the same reason that it would be folly to legislate for the State by mass meetiug.and that it isjadvisable to do tbe State business by Governor, Senate and House, is it folly, after a place has reached a certain Tbedisposal of the Agricultural Fund in Ver mont is calling forth a sharp sectarian disenssion, and a plan is on foot to establish a State Univer sity, under political control, and ia some uiy consolidate the existing colleges under the same power.

(7) 1 There has never been any "political St ite University in Vermont" nor anv at U'npt to make one from the day of the State's beginning to the present time. The University of Vermont is by its act of incor poration, and it always has been, as free from political or State control of any sort, as any college in New England. Two State officers are x-officio members of its board of trust. Several or the New England col leges have State oEccrs, es-officio, members of their boards of trust ; but their power or influence for the time being is no different from that of other members. Political rela tions have never been thought of in the University of Vermont, and if any member were desirouB to have regard to them he would be powerless to effect any thing. There is no ground for the assertion that it was popular to have but very few men of religious character in the board when the University was incorporated. Ten men of eminent character were named in the act of incorjoration as trustees, two of whom A letter in an Augusta, Ga., paper, about Sherman s match, says : " Many negroes were enticed away from homes of comfort to share the anoertain fortunes of a winter's march to the coast, and then forced to starve, ramilm of wealth have not a hcasr servant left, and those who were the most trusted nere often tbe first to leave." Sherman's passage through tbe centre of what is left of the Confederacy, will, no doubt,uin a door of eseape from slavery for many a negro. It is a significant fact that the most trusty negroes are often tbe first to leave ; an inevitable inference is, that negroes don t really like slavery, after all.

It is not claimed ttist tlie election has iaiimsed a duty on members to C'.nge their views or their votes any further than as an additional element to lie consider -i u us their judgment may he aSeeted by it.

K1UENT EUCTION. In this ease, the common end is the amin tt nance of toe I nun. and am.iag tbe means t. secure tl at end, such will, through tbr . lection, is must clearly declared in htvor ot st.i ii coostit .tiunal aiueiMimant The most r liable indication of puldie purpose in this Co .ntry is d. rif .-d tin mgh our popular elee li ma. Judging by the recent eanvas and its lesult, tne piirpose uf the people within the loyal stat. a to maintain the inlrnty ul ti.e I ni .n was never more hrm nor more nearly arutitimi.us tlan now. The extraor dinary calmness aad good order with which th millions of vuters met and mingled at t e pulls, give strong assurance of this. Not o all those who supported tbe union t caet" (so called.) but a great majoritv uf the opposing party also may be fairly claim id to entertain and to be actuated by the -ante purpose. It is rn unanswerahlv argu uveut tu this effect, that noeamiidate fur anv otoee whatever, nigh ur low. has ventured tosaask votes on the avuwal that he was tor git ing up the Inion. There have been m. eh impugn leg ol motives and much beat ad ctnt-oiersy as to the prtqer taesas and last mode of advancing the Union cause, hut in tbe distinct issue .t I ni ni or no Inion t:ie pi itician. hate shown their instinctive Knowledge that tin re is no diversity among the people. In affording tlie wopk the fair opportunity of showing one to another, and t toe world, this financs and unanimitv of pu.-iaw , the election has been of vast value Hie national cause, f he election has ex hibited another fact not less valuable to be km.wu. the fact that we do not approach ex haustion in tbe must important branch oftbe national resources that of living men. WI.ilc it is melancholy to reflect that tbe war has tilled so many graves and carried mourning to so many " hearts, it ia some re lict to know that, compared with tbe survi ving, the fallen have been so few.

Tbe numlar iu organized territories is triple now what it was four years ago while thousands white and black jinn us as the national arms press back the in-urgent lines. So much is shown affirmatively and negatitth by tlie election. It is not material to inquire bow the increase has been produced, or to show that it wuuld have been greater but for the war. whieh prulobly true ; the important fact remains demonstrated, that we have more men now than we had when tbe war btg-an, that we are not txhausted nor in process of exhaus tion ; that we are gaining strength, and may, il need he. maintain the contest inde finitely. This as to men. .Material resources are now more complete and abundant than eter. The national re sources, thtn, are uncxhausttd, and. as we believe, inexhaustible. The public purpose to re-wtaWish ind maintain the national authority w unchanged, and, as we believe, unchangeable. The tuanticr ol continuing the effort remains to choose. in. an j,, , utsin "teeifieil terms were offered ti ;i ctpt certain designated classes, and it tlie same time made known that the . x. ; -. classes were still within contemplau i, srecial clemency.
