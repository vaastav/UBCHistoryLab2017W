SUBSCRIPTION Doesn't JerkJust Pulls. "If there is one enterprise on earth that a 'quitter' should leave entirely alone it is advertising. To make a success of advertising, one mast be prepared to stick to it like a barnacle on a boat's bottom. He should know be fore he begins it that he must spend money. Somebody must tell him, also, that he cannot reap results commens urate with his expenditure early in the game. "Advertising doesn't jerk, it pulls. It begins very gent ly at first, but the pull is steady. It increases day by day and year by year until it exerts an irresistible power. "JOHN WANAMAKER." "Cautiously and Care fully" THERE is no quest on in the world today at all commensurate in importance to the people of this country with the question of the growth and conduct of great corporations. Great combina tions of capital are the significant features of the industrial and commercial evolution of the times. These great combinations are nob things to be hunted down and killed, and the hue and cry raised against them Iper se is a greater evil than the fact of the combinations themselves. Could the radicals who demand the life of every great corporation haye their way ruin, complete and terrible, would overwhelm eyery legitimate enterprise in the country. These combinations are part of the industrial and commeicial hfe of the country, and cannot be destroyed without ending all industrial and com mercial life at the same time. What is wanted is regulation, not killing, "Our steady aim should be by legislation, cautious ly and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to as sert the soverignty of the na tional government by affirmative action," declares President Roosevelt in his annual message to Congress. Hei is the only remedy that can be safely ap plied government regulation. Its application may not be as ex peditious as we desire but we are not wise enough to make the proper remedy today, even had we the power. Time will show us what form the remedy must take. Great corporations did nob be come a part of our business life in a day neither will their con trol be accomplished in a day. We have to proceed "cautiously and carefully." 

FOLLETTE will not be a Cold It should be borne in mind that every cold weakens the lungs, low ers the vitality and prepares the system for the more serious dis eases, among which are the two greatest destroyers of human life, pneumonia and consumption. Chamberlain's Cough Remedy has won its great popularity by its prompt cures of this most common ailment. It aids expectoration, re lieves the lungs and opens the secretions, effecting a speedy and permanent cure. It counteracts any tendency toward pneumonia.
