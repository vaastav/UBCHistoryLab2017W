Let tho Government liquidate this obliga tion and rest in peace." Wo believo we can safely say thai (hero am no more glaring frauds practiced upon the Govorunient tlinn have been practiced through llio piet system adopted of pen sioning soldiers ot the lata war. While there aro worthy nnd deserving soldiers who have had their papers on llio for years, whom every ono acquainted Willi tho fncta feel (hat it is n burning shsnio thnt their enso is permitted lo drag nlonc year nfler year with but little prospect of justice being dolio until it is loo lute, yet through boibio litllo technicality and with out politic il Influence they nre compelled to watch nnd wail. Thousands of olhor cases more deserving thnn tlioo who hnd no apparent (rouble in securing pensions, disgusted with the operations! of pension laws and thoso who frndulcnlly operate them, hnvc not and will not apply tor re lief. Almost every community hnve pnrnlcll cases wliero men who probably never carried n musket for a day while they were intlio army, nnd whoeo principle occupation for the subsequent twenty years hns been to punish nil tho poor whisky they could get hold of, yet they hnvc no apparent trouble in gelling a ponison and a thousand or fifteen hundred dollars usually Insts them less than n year. These aro not tlio men upon which Ihe hopo of a Republic rests. We have a case in our mlnd'a eye whero n Union (?) soldier wrote letter after letter homo discouraging re-enlistments, pronouncing il "a d d Abolition war," anilf-eized upon lite first pretext of n slight flesh wound to get out nnd remain out of Ihe Md d Abolition war. He was a 'horn' Democrnl, but seired upon the first opportunity to gel an office in Iho Repub lican party mid "nil of a sudden" hec.ime a rampant Republican. During (lie years of reconstruction nnd political excitement Iho opportunity dawned for fortunes about the i.iinc as that presented to the pick-pocket in the rush of a mass ot peo ple to get on n host or train which was improved by this Republican Union sold ier nnd fortune followed fast. The road from poverty lo nflluence was a shorl one. Arrogance and men of 'fliience' followed. Some of theso visited Wnshiiigtun fre quently, hnd nn axe to grind and get in terviewed. This patriotic soldier who had already become fnt at public expense went down on llio Government he fit nnd (il lo save fur coid thouasnd of hack pension and through these men of 'fiuence' bad 110 trouble in gelling it. Another case, visible to the naked eye in Wood county, la a soldier f?J who. according to the testimony of his com rades in tho same regiment, scarcely ever carried a musket while in Ihe service, but was a hnnger-on around headquarters and devoted tlio priuciplo part ol his time and talent with the rations dcvlcrs for gambling through which Iiu could gel from his honest and les experienced com mand Iheir SIC per month in greenbacks worth 51 cents on Ihe dollar. In an evil hour, while far in the rear of his com rades, as report says, were two soldiers astride of a log playing pnkcr. A piece of a stray shell found lis way to this spot and fractured the leg ol one of ihu Bohlirr. Il hnd to he nmpuUled ami he beeauio n pensioner upon Ihe Government, and aiib. sequent ly a stool pigeon for money sharks and political demagogues. Ho has en joyed the freedom of tlio county offices fur some eighteen years past. UN knowledge of "ways Hint are dark and (ricks that nrc v.dn" have become invaluable to the new officials as lliey nie sent in by iho people, one, two nnd three at a time lo transact die business nnd look after the welfnro of tho county. Il lias proven n bonanza, anil report saya he can now give his family $f0 per week, pin money, with instruc tions to be libera with (be churches. It Is such cases as these (hat disgust the people nnd cause them nnd their rep resentatives in Congress lo feel indifferent in regard lo dtdng j.islice lo Ihe union soldier.

Amid nil of the incongruous political elements of which the approaching Con gress will be composed, ll seems to he taken for granted thnt the principle and perhaps the only bone of contention will bo that between tho tariff icformcrs and tho formidable cloiucnt comprising the inon of bulli parlies who aro out nnd out puro and simple fico traders. Tho latter havo the Speakership, nnd with the Spea ker, Ihcy of course hnve tho composition of the entire 47 standing committees -ol t lie House, ns well as that of nny select committee which mny be appointed to con sider questions grnwiiig out of the tariff. During the vacation the free traders have been busily ut work in tho creation of public sentiment in fnvnr of their pel tlicury, while Mr. KmiiIuII and Mr. Kelley , have been cqu illy busy in putting iu n good word distinctively prottctivc. Of course when il comes to a downright figut between the lriends of Mr. Raiubill uud those of Mr. Curll'-le, the Pennsylvania statesman will find himself the under, amine in the contest, Iu which position, Iionover, ho wilt not forget to c.ill upon his Republican lrieuds ol the Pig lion Kelley persuasion lo help him out, nnd be may nol call in vain. Taking theso things together, then, I may safely predict, that there will be some legislation upon Ihe InrifTlhis winter, Ih it wilt bo something more than n tariff for revenuo only, for Mr. Ruidsll is not sent here to eecure Hint kind uf a 1 11 riff. 1 do not know the capiclty of Mr. J.

MA1I0XE." (From the Xcw York Kvcnlng Tost.) The almost incredible announcement is made that the republicans of the Korlli have decided lo muko Mahouc's cause in Virginia Iheir own by sending money nnd speakers to his aid. Among tho speiktrs who nrosaid to be going upon this extra ordinary errand, nre Judge Fnniker, Gen eral Logan, Congressman Kelley, of Penn sylvania, nud Senator Hoar's name is not nn the list, but it ought lo be lo make it complete. Three of Ihe men named, Fornker, Sherman, nnd Logan, aro, next In Mr. Iloir, the republican lenders of Ihe North who are most deeply concerned nbout Iho Importance ol tho sectional question and ila bc-iring njion the "rights of tho poor negro." They s.iy that (Ins is the overshadowing issue iu national poli tics, and thai nothing will induce them to abandon its agitation. Yet they nro go ing to Virginia to help Mahone, in the name nf the republican parly; thus identi fying him and his cause with the cause of the repblicnn parly, thus making his work in the South typical of what the rcpubll can paily would liko to see sustained there if it were in power. Il is not possible to say of these men, especially ol Messrs. Sherman and Logan, that they do rot' know what Mahone stands for in Southern politic", for they have been in tlio Senate with lnni in the disreputable political bargain by which his vote wns purchased for the republicans In return for Ihe idwnlule control of the Federal patronage nt Virginia. That such a bargain wns made nnd kept Is a matter of political hislory. Mesrs, Sherman and Login nrc entirely consistent in still standing by their old confederate; but their audacity in doing it, in the present state of public opinion, and in the face of their sanctimonious utterances about the poor negro, is almost bewildering. Let us ree what they nrc going lo endorse in the name of the Northern republican parly when they look up Mnhonc'a cause: 1 They must endorse his course ns n repudiated from 1873 down to the present time. When he appeared In the politics of Virginia in 1873 Ihe State was firmly and appircr.lly Inflexibly set against the repudiation tide which was submerging the fair credit of other Southern States. A small faction ot uniiifluenllal voters were agitating for repudiation, bill they were overwhelmingly outnumbered by the honest people ot the'.Siiile, who stood" 1111 falleringly liy Iheir State's honor.
