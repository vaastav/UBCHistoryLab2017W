"5 a Ey Both branches of Congress having or ganized on Monday, the Annnal Mcssago of tho President was on that day transmitted them. As is usual with documents of this character, it is of considerable longth, and hav ing no wish to inflict our readers with its pe rusal in its original dimensions, we have taken tho liberty of lopping off tho uninteresting portions and assuming the responsibility of such a course being deemod disloyal. After alluding to the lapse of another year of health and bountiful harvests, since tho last meeting of Congress, and attributing to the Almighty the continuance of tho war, the President passes immediately to a consider ation of our Foreign relations. Of them, he appears to think that though bad enough they are not as desperate as they might be. Ho complains of the Foreign pow ers having acknowledged the insurgents as a belligerent, and thinks they would have backed down from that position, hut for the exaggera ted statements made by "disloyal citizens abroad" of the "temporary reverses" which befel our arms. In other respects our rela tions with foreign powers are represented as g (ting on swimingly, if wo except some claims for violating nontral rights by tho blockading squadron, which claims are most ly in process of adjustment. Some, how ever, it is proposed to refer to mutual conven tions, which proposition, he says, has been kindly received, hut not yet formally adopted. Tlio "nigger, under the title of "Free Amer icana of African descent" is the next subject bronchcd and hero we feel disposed to give his I.xccllcncy full length of tho rope, hoping, however, that in his next he may find it con venient to devote the same space and as much sympathy to the welfare of "Free Americans," of the white species. He says : Applications liavo been made to me by niany free Americans of African descent to favor theiremigration, with a view to such coloni zation as wa3 contemplated by recent acts of Congress. Other parties, at homo and abroad —some from interested motives, others upon patriotic considerations, and still ot lcrs in fluenced by philanthropic sent ma us —havo suggestod similar measures ; wi.i.o, on the other hand, several of tho Spanish-American republics have protested against tho sending of such colonics to their respective territories. Under theso circumstances, I havo declined to movo any such colony to any stato, without first obtaining the consont of its government, with an agreement on its part to receive and protect such emigrants in all tho- rights of freemen ; and I have, at tho same time, otter ed to the several states situated within tho tropics, or having colonies there, to negotiate with them, subject to tho advice and consent of the Senate, to favor the voluntary emigra tion of persons of that class to their respec tive territories, upon conditions that shall be equal, just and humane. Liberia and liayti are, as yet, the only countries to which colo nics of African descent from hore could go with certainty of being received and adopted as citizens ; and I regret to say such persons, contemplating colonization, do uot seem so willing to migrate to those countries as to some others, nor so willing as I think their intcrost demands. I believe, however, opin ion among llicin, in this respect, is improving, and that ore long there will be an augmented and considerable migration to both these coun tries from the United States." A treaty of any description with the white j people of the Southern States is a thing not j to bo mentioned, but a commercial and contu- j lar treaty with the negro governments of Li beria and Hayti, he says has been negotiated, from which beneficial result* to tho national commerce is anticipated. After saying that tho project for an Atlantic •legraph connecting tho United States, with Europe his been by him favored, he takes up the subject of tho Territories, and says:— I have favored the project for connecting the United States with Europe by an Atlantic telegvaph and a similar project to extend tho tolcgraph from San Francisco, to connect by a Pacific telegraph with the line which is be ing extended across the Russian empire. The Territories of the United States, with an important exception, havo remained undis turbed by the civil war; and they arc exhibit lug such ovidcnco of prosperity as justifies an expectation that some of them will soon be in a condition to be organized as States and be constitutionally admitted into the Federal Union. Tho immense mineral resources of seine of those Territories ought to bo developed ns rapidly as possible. Every step in that di rection would have a tendency to improve the revenues of tho Government and diminish the burdens of tho people. It is worthy of your serious consideration whether some extraordi nary measures to promote that end cannot be adopted. The means which suggosts itself as most effective, is a scientific exploration of the mineral regious of those Territories, with a view to tho publication of its results at borne and in foreign countries—results which can not fnii to be auspicious. Tift subject of the "almighty dollar," or in other words the finances, is next taken up, and the "dilligent consideration" of Congress upon it urged. The "vast expenditures," he says rendered necessary by the Rebellion have "hitherto been "promptly" met, an assertion which by the way, many of the nnpaid sol dicrs in the army have reason to dispute. Of the hereafter, however, he appears to enter tain some uneasiness, and say a : The continuance of the war, however, and the increased disbursement! made necessary by tho augmented forces now in the field, de mand your best reflections as to the hast modes of providing tho neeessary revenue, Without injury to business, and with the least possible burdens upon labor, The large issue of "legal tenders" (redeem able of pleatnre) he consider* was made una voidable by the suspension of specie payment* by the Banks. He deems the legislation which brought them Into existence and gave u a currency thirty per cent worse than that wo had, as especially "judicious," and yet With AI "universal currency, " which as he assorts, has, saved to the people "immense sums in discounts and exchanges," he thinks "a return * specie payment." at an early day, "ih<VMW*r be kept in view." Aft ft for thii depreciated enrrenev h. proposes thl novel moasurorf UsuingTstill I***** hatch in other word*, of farDishinir the *ll forma, $529,692,460 50. Tb* remainder, 92,257,061 80, was the balance from last yelr. The disbursements during the same period were for congressional, cqecutive and judicial purposes, $3 ( 939i009 19[ for foreign inter course, $1,336,710 35; for miscellaneous ex- Sonsos, including the mints, loans, post office eficienCies, collection of revenue and other like charges, $14,129,771 68; for expenses under the Interior Department, $3,102,084 52; under the War.department, $394,368,307 36; under the Navy Department, $42,671,509 69; for interest on public debt, $13,190,324 45; and for payment oJ public debt,including reim bursements of temporary loan and redemp- making an aggregate $570,841,700 25, and leoving a balance in $13,043 day ofsul y- of be observed that the sum of $96,- 090,922 09, expended for reimbursements and redemption of public debt, being included al •o in the loans made, may be properly deduc ted, both from receipts and expenditures, ma king the actual receipts for the year $487,787, 324 97; and the expenditures $404,744,778 16. It gives nie pleasure to report a decided im provement in the financial condition of the Post Office Department, as compared with— scvoral preceding years. The receipis for the fiscal year 1861 amounted to $8,549,256 40, which embraced the revenue from all the States of the Union for three quarters of that year.— Notwithstanding tho cessation of revenue from tho.so-callcd seceded States during the last 6scal year, the increase of the correspondence of the loyal States has been sufficient to pro duce a revenue during tho same year of SB,- 269,220 70, being only $50,000 loss than was derived froin all the States of the Union during the previous year. The expenditures show a still more favorable result. The amount ex pended in 1861 was $13,606,759 11. For the Inst year the amount has been reduced to sl2- 125,364 13; showing a decrease of about $2,- 4oi,oooin the expenditures as compared with tho preceding year, aud about $3,750,000 as compared with tho fiscal year, 1860. Tho de ficiency in the dopnriment for the previous year was $4,551,966 98. For the last fiscal year it was reduced to $2,112,814 87. These favorablo results are in pact owing to the cessation of mail service in the insurrec tionary States, and in part to a careful review of all expenditures in that department in the interest of economy. Tho efficiency of tho postal service, it is believed, lias also been much improved. The Postmaster General has also opened a correspondence, through tho De partment of State, with foreign governments, proposing a convention of postal rcpresenta tatives for tho pnrposeof simplifying the rates j of foreign postage, and to expedite the foreign mails. This proposition, equally important to our adopted citizens, and to the commercial interests of this country, has been favorably entertained, and agreed to, by all the govern ments from whom replies have boon received. The Sectetary of the Interior reports as fol lows in regard to the public lands : "Tho public lands have ceased to bo a source of rcvenuo. From tho Ist ef J illy t 1861, to the 30th of September, 1862, the entire cash receipts from the sale of lands wore $136,- 470 20—a sum much less than tho oxponses of our land system during the same period. Tho homestead law, wnich will tako effect on tho Ist of January ucxt, offers such inducements to settlers, that sales for cash cannot be ex pected to an extent sufficient to meet the ex qenses of tho General Land Office, and the cost of surveying and bringing the land Into market." Of the lesser Rebellion—that among the Indian tribes in tbe West—of Internal Im provements and of the Department of Agri culture ho next treats, all of which wo give in full The Indian tribes upon our frontiers have, during tho past year, manifested a spirit of insubordination, and, at several points, linvc engaged in open hostilities against the white settlements in their vicinity. The tribes occu pying the Indian country south of Kansas, renounced their allegiance to the United States and entered into treaties with the insurgents. Those who remained loyal to tho United States were driven from tho country. The chief of the Clicrokces has visited this city for tho purpose of restoring the former relations of the tribe with the United Stales. lie alle ges that they were constrained by superior force, fo enter into treaties with the insurgents, and that the United States neglected to furnish the protection which their treaty stipulations required. In the month of August last, the Sioux In dians, iu Minnesota, attacked the settlements in their vicinity with extreme ferocity, killing, indiscriminately, men, women and children. This attack was wholly unexpected, and, therefore, no means of defense had been pro vided. It is estimated tliat not less than eight hundred persons wore killed by tho Indians, and a large amount of property was destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definite ly known, and suspicions, which may oc un just, need not be stated. Information was re ceived by the Indian from different sources, about tho time hostilities were com menced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes between the Mississippi river and the Rocky mountains. Tho State of Minnesota ha 3 suffered great injury from this Indian war. A large portion of her territory has been de populated, and a serero loss has been sustain ed by the destruclion of property! The pcoplo of that State manifest much anxiety for the removal of the tribes beyond the limits the State as a guarantee against future hostilities. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs will fur nish full details. I submit for your cspecia consideration whether our Indian system shall not be remodelled. Many wise and good men havo impressed mo with tho belief that this can bo profitably done. I submit a statement of the proceedings of commissioners which shows tho progress that has been made in the enterprise of construct ing the Pacific railrtad. And this suggests the earliest completion of this road, and also the favorable action of Congress upon the pre jects now pending before them of enlarging the capacities of the great canals In New York and Illinois, as being of vital and rapidly in creasing importance to the whole nation, and especially to the vact interior region hereinaf ter to be noticed at greater length. I purpose having prepared and laid before you at an early day scone interesting and valuable stat istical information upon thii subject. The military and commercial importance of en larging the' Illinois and Michigan canal, and improving the IlUnoifl river, is presented in the report of€ol. Webeter to the Secretary of War, and now transmitted to Congress; I respect fully ask atteiislon to ft. To carry out the provisions of the act of Congress of the 16th of May last, I have caus ed the Department of Agriculture Of tho Uni ted States to be organised. The Commissioner informs mo fhit within the period of a few months this department has established an extensive system of corres pondence aid exchanges, both at home and abroad, which promises to effect highly bene ficial results in the development of a correct knowledge of recent improvement in agricul ture, in the' introduction of new producja, and in the collection of the statistics of the different States. Also, that it will soon be prepared to dis tribute largely Berts; cereals, plants and Cfit tings, and has already published, and liberal ljrdiffused, much valuably information inan r. mriiate° pf our most valuable cithams, and I trust that the liberal Basis ttpon which it has been organised will not only meet your approbation, but thai ' it will realise ai.no dktaal day alHh* rondest anticipations of its most sanguine friends, end become the fruitful source of advantage to all our people.' The fevorite hoppy of Us Excellency "compensated emancipation," is next taken np aud discussed. Wo give this part of the document in foil. On the 22d of September last a proclama tion was issued by the Executive, a copy of which is herewith submitted: In accordance with the purpose expressed in the second paragraph of that paper, I now respectfully call your attention to what may be called "compensated emancipation." A nation may be said to consist of its terri tory, its people, and its laws. The territory is the only part which is certain of durability. "One generation passeth away, and another cometli, but the earth abideth forevor." It is of the first importance to duly consider and estimate this ever-enduring part. That por tion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabited by the people of the United States, is well adapted to bo the home of one nation al family, and it is not well adapted for two, or more. Its vast extent, and its variety of climate and productions, are of advantage, iu this age, for ono people, whatever they may have bceu in former ages.' Steam, telegraphs and intelligence, have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one united peo ple. In the inaugural address I briefly pointed out. the total inadequacy of disunion as reme dy for the differences between the people ol the two sections. I did so in language which I cannot improve, aud which, therefore, I beg to repeat i "One section of our country believes slaverj is right, and ought to be extended, whilo the other believes it is wrong, and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dis pute. The fugitivo slave clause of the Con stitution, and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave trade, are each as well en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever bo in a community where the moral sense of the peo ple imperfectly support the law itself. Tho great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases, and a few break over in each. This, 1 think, cannot be perfectly cured ; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections, than be fore. The foreign slave trade, now imperfect ly suppressed, would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section ; while fugi tive slaves, now only partially surrendered, would not be surrendered at all by tho other. Physically speaking, we cannot separate.— We cannot' remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall between them. A husband and wife may be divorced, and go out of the presence, and be yond the reach of each other: but the differ ent parts of our country cannot do this, They cannot but remain face to face; and inter course, cither amicable ot hostile, must con tinue between them. Is it possible, then, to make that intavenurso mora iMlr-uwgwua or more satisfactory after separation than before? Oftn aliens luuhc trcatioo oaoto* tkun friends can make laws ? Can treaties bo more faith fully enforced between aliens than laws can among friends ? Suppose you go to war, you cannot fight always ; and when, after much loss on both sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you. Thero is no lino, straight or crooked, suita ble for a national boundary, upon which to di vido. Trace through, from east to west, upon the lino between tho free and slave country, and wo shall find a little more than one third of its length are rivers, easy to bo crossed, and populated, or soon to be populated, thickly upon both sides; whilo noarly all its remain iug length are merely surveyors' lines, over which people may walk back and forth without any cousciousncss of their presonco. No part of this line can bo made more difficult to pass, by writing it down on paper or parchment, as a national boundary. Tho fact of separation, if it comes, gives up, on tho part of the suc ceeding section, the fugitivo slave clauso, along with all othor constitutional obligations upon the section sccoded from, whilo I should expect no treaty stipulation would ever be made to take its place. but thero is another difficulty. The groat interior rogicn, bounded oast by the Allegho nies, north by the British dominions, west by the Rocky Mountains, and south by tho line aloiig which tho culture of corn and cotton moots, and which includes part of Virginia, part of Tennessee, all of Kentucky, Ohio, In diana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Missou ri, Kansas, lowa, Minnesota, and the Territo ries of Dakota, Nebraska, and part of Colora do, already has above ton millions of people, and will have fifty millions within fifty years ii not pfevb'ntctd by any politieal folly or mis take. It contains moro than one-third of the country owned by the United States—certain ly more than one million of square miles.— Once half as populous as Mass' already is, it would have more.than seventy-five mil-, lions of people. A glance 4t the map shows that, territorially spbaking, it Is tho gbeat body of the Republic. A glance at the map shows that, territorially speaking, it it the great body of the Republic The other parts are but marginal border to it, the magnificent region sloping west from the Rocky Moun tains to the Pacific being the deepest and also the richest in undeveloped resonrces. In the prodnction of provisions, grains, grasses and all which proceed from them, this groat interi or region is naturally ohe of the most tmpor tant in the world. Ascertain from the statis tics the small proportion of the region which has, Sa yet, been brought into cultivation, and also the large and rapidly increasing amount of its products, and we shall be overwhelmed with the magnitude of the prospect presented. As yet tbd region has no sea cOßat, tonches no ocean anywhOnef. A part of tare nation, its people now find, aud may forever find their, way to Europe by New Ytorh; to South Ameri ca and Africa by New Ortecais; turd to Asia by San Francisco. But separate our common eountry into two nations, ss designed by the present rebellion, and svejy man of this great interior region is thereby ctrf off from some one or more of these outlets; hot, perhaps, by a physical harrier, but bjr cmbarrising and on erous regulations. And this is trus. wherever a dividing; of boundary line may be fixed. Place it between the new free end *!*• country, or place ft sdUth of Kentucky; Or north of Ohio, and still ' ft* truth remains, that none south of it sen tradcwxay port or place north of it, and none north of it can trade to any port or place soulh of it, extapt on tortns dictated by a govern ment foreign to them. These outlots, east, west and south, are indispensable to the well being of the poople inhibiting, and to inhabit, lti| vast interior region. Which of the three may bt the best, is no proper question. All are better than either; and all, of right, belong to the people, ind lo their successors forever. True to themselves, thoy will not ask where a line of a teparation shall be, but will vow, rather, that thero shall be, no snch line. Nor are the marginal regions less intersected in these communications to, and through them to the great outside world. They too, and each of them, must have access to this Egypt of tho West, withont passing toll at tho crossing of any national boundary. Our national strifo springs not from onr permanent parts ; not foom the land we in habit; not from our national homestead. — Theie is no possible severing of this but would multiply, and not migrate, evils among us.— In ail its adaptions and aptitudes, it demands uniin and abhors separation. In fact, it would ere ong, force re-union, however much of blood and treasure the separation might have cost. Cur strife pertains to ourselves—to the pas sind generations of men ; and it can, without convulsion, be hushed forever with the pas sing of one generation. In this view, I recommend tho adoption of the following resolution and articles araonda tory to the Constitution of the United States: "Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep resentatives ol the United States of America in Congress assembled, (two-thirds of both houses concurring,) That the following arti cles be proposed to the Legislatures (or con ventions) of the several States as amendments to the Constitution of the United States, all. or any of which articles when ratified by three fourths of the said Legislatures (or conven tions) or to be valid as part or parts of the said Constitution, viz: 

"ARTICLE—. "Every State, wherein slavery now exists, which shall abolish the same therein at any time or times before tho first day of January, in tire year of our Lord one thousand aud nine hundred, shall receive compensation from tho United States as follows, to wit: "The President of the United States shall dciivor to every such State, bonds of tho Uni ted States, bearing interest at the rate of per cent, per annum, to an amonnt equal to the aggregate sum of for eaeli slave shown to have been therein, by the eighth cen sus of tho United States, said bonds to be de livered td such State by instalments, or in one parcel, nt the completion of the abolishmortt, accordingly as the same shall have been grad ual, or at one time, within such State : and interest shall begin to run upon any such bond only from tho proper time of its delivery as aforesaid. Any State having received bonds as aforesaid, and afterwards reintroduciue or tolerating slavery therein, shall refund to the United States the bonds so received, or the value thereof, and all interest paid thereon. 

"ARTICLE—— "All slaves Who shall have enjoyed actual freedom by the chances of war, at any time before the end of the rehellion, shall be forev er free ; but all owners of such, who shall not have been disloyal, shall be compensated for them, at tho same rrte as is provided for States adopting abolishment of slavery, but in such way that no slave shall bo twice accoun ted-for. "ARTICLE —. "Congress may appropriate money, and otherwiso provide, for colonizing free colored persons, with their own consent, at any place or places without the United States." I bog indulgence to discuss these proposed articles at some length. Without slavery the rebellion could never have existed; without slavery it could not continues Among the friends of the Union thero is a great diversity of sentiment and of policy in regard to slavery and the African race amongst usi Some would perpetuate slavery; eonre would abolish it suddenly, and without com pensation; some wopld abolish it gradually, and with compensation ; some would remove the freed poople fsom among us, and some would retain them with us; and thero are yet other minor diversities. Because of these di versities, we waste much strength in struggles aofong ourselves. By mutual concesssion we should harmonizo and act together. This would be compromise; but it would be Com promise among the friends; and not with the . enemies, of the Union. These articles sire in tended to embody a plan of such mutual oon i cessions. If the plan shall be adopted, it is assumed that emancipation will follow—at > least in sevesal of the States. 1 , As to the first article, the main points are: ' first, the emancipation; secondly, the length of-time for consummating it—thirty-seven " -Vfcrtij and thirdly, the compensation. | The emancipation will be unsatisfactory to | to the advocates of perpetual slavery, but the , length of time should greatly mitigate their t dissatisfaction. The time spares both races t from the evils of sudden derangement—in fact, from the necessity of any derangement—while > most of those whose habitual course of thought 1 will be disturbed by the measure will have 1 ppssed away before its consummation, They ' Will never sea it. Another class will hail tho prospect of emancipation, but wiH deprecate j the length of time. They will feel that K gives I too little to the now living slaves. But it re t ally gives them muoh. R saves them from I the vagrant destitution which must largely at tend immediate emancipation in th* localities > where their numbers are very great; and it i gives the inspiring assurance that their poster t By shall be free forever. The plan leaves to • each Stat* choosing to not under ft, to abolish r slavery now, or at the end of the century, or 1 at any iaterinediate time, or by degrees, ex ® tending over the whole o* any pert of the' pe , riod, and it obliges no two* States to proceed m alike. It also provides fw compensation, and generally tho mode of it/ This, it Would seem, must farther mitigate the diytis* i faction of those who favor perpetual sfjftery, a aWd especially of those' who are to receive the t compensation. Doubtieee some of those who 1 ate to pay, and not to receive, will object. Yet a the measure is both just aud economkal. In a certain sense, the litfcration of slaves destruction of property—property acquired y descent, or by purchase, the same as other property: ~ It is no less true for baring been often said, that the beople of the South are not more res ponsible for the original introduction of tins property than are the North; and whbn it is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton and sugar, and share thb profits of deal ing in them, it may not be quite safo to say that the South has been more responsible than the North for its continuance. If, then, for a common object, this property is to be sacrifi ced, is it not just that it be done at a common charge ? And if, with less money, or money more eas ily paid, we can preserve the benefits of the Union by this means, than we can by the war alone, is it not also economical to do it ? Let us consider it then. Let us ascertain the sum we have expended in the war since compensa ted emancipation was proposed last March, and consider whether, if that measure had been promptly accepted by even somo of the slave States, thosame sum would not have done more to close the war than has been otherwise done. If so, the mcdsuro wpuld save money, and, in that view, would b a prudent and econom ical measnrc. Certainly it is not so easy to pay something as it is to pay nothing; but it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one. And it is easier to pay any sum when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able. Tho wfli 1 requires large sums, and requires them at once. The aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation, of course, would be large. But it would require no ready cash; nor the bonds even, any faster than the emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of thirty-seven years. At that time we sliatl probably have a hundred millions of people to share the bur den, instead of thirty-one millions, as no*.— And not only so, but the increase of our pop ulation may bo expected to continue for a long time after that period, as rapidly as before; because our territory will not have become full. Ido not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which w b talned, on an average, from our first national census, in 1690, until that of 1860, we should, in 1900, have a population of 103,208,415. — Aud why may wo not continue that ratio far beyond that period. Our abundant room— our broad national homestead—is our atopic resource. Were our territory as limited ais the British Isles, very certainly our population could not expand as stated. Instead of re ceiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of tho native born away. But such is not our condition: We have two millions nine hundred and sixty three thousand square miles. Euronn boa i- — ;u; — —* eight hundred thousand, with a population averaging seventy-three to tho squaro mile.— Why may not our country, at some time, av erage as many? Is it less fertile? Has it more waste surface by mountains, rivers, lakes; des erts or other causes? Is it inferior to Europe in any natural advantage,- Tho plan is proposed as permanent consti tutional law. It cannot become such without tho fconctirrence of, first, two-thirds of Con gress, and; afterwards, three-fourths of the States. The ' requisite three-fourths of the States will, necessarily; include seven of the slave States. Their concurrence, if obtained, will give assurance of their severally adopting emancipation at no very distant day, upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance of their severally adopted emancipation, at no very distaut day, upon the new constitutional terms. This assurance would ond the struggle now, and save the Union forfever: I do not forgot the gravity which should characterize a paper addressed to the Congress of the nation, -by the Chief Magistrate of the nation. Nor do I forgef that some Of you are my seniors; nor that more of ycru have more experience than I, in the conduct of publio af faire. Yet I trust that in vinw of the great responsibility resting upon me; you will per ceive no want of respect to yourselves, in iny undue eartlestncss I may seem to display. Is it doubted, then; that tho plan I propose, if adopted, would shorten the war, and thus lessen its expenditure of money and of blood? Is it doubted that it would restore the nation al authority and national prosperity? Is it doubted that wo here—Congress and Execu tive—can secure its adoption? Will not the good people resfcbnd to t united and earnest appeal from us? Can we, can they, by any other means, so certainly, or so speedily, as sure these vital objects? We can succeed only by concert. It is not, "con any of us imagine better?" but, "can we all do batter?" The dogmas of the quiet pasi are inadequate to the stofxiiy present. The Occasion is pi|ed high with difficulty, and we must rise with the o& casion. As oQr case is new, so we must think anew and act anew; Wo must disenthrall our selves. and thai we shall save our country. If then we are, at some time, to be as-pop ulous as Europe, how Sootf? As to when this may be we can judge by the past and the pres ent; as to when it wiH be, or even, depends much on whether we maintain the Union.— Several of our States are already above the average of Europe—seventy-three and a third to the square mile. Massachusetts has. 107; Rhode Island, 188; Connecticut! 90; New York, and New Jersoy, each 80. Also two other great States, Pennsylvania and Ohio, are not far below, the former having 68 and the latter 69. The States already above the European average, except New York, have increased in as rapid a ratio since passing that point aa evkr before; while no one of them is equal to some other parts of our country in natural ca pacity for sustaining a denso population. Taking the nation in the aggregate mid we find its population and ratio of mcfoasd for the several decennial periods to boas follows: 1790 3,929,827 1800 6,306,987 85.03 pr.'ct. ratio's? increase 1810 V,2Bfl,Btf 86.46 - 1820 0,688,181 69.16 A ,f| 1880 12,866,020 88.49 ' .. 1840 17,069,458 82.67 1860 28,191,867 86,87 •< 1860 81,448,790 86.69 " This shows ad avenge decennial increase of 84.60 per oent: in population through the sev enty years from our firit to odr last census yet taken. It is eeen that thb ration of in crease, at no one of these seven periods, is ei ther 2 per cent, below or 2 percent; above the average, thus showing how inflexible and, consequently, how reliable the law of increase in our caso is. Assuming that it will contin ue, gives the following results: 1870. " <2,828,841 1880; 66,967,216 1890. 76,677,872 1900. 108,208,416 1910. 138,918,626 1930. 188,984,336 1930. 261,680,914 These figures show that ohr country may be as populous aB Europe now is, at some point between 1920 and 1980 —say about 1926—0ur territory, at seventy-three and a third persons to the square mile, being a capacity to contain 217,168,000. And we will reach this, too, if we do not ourselves relinquish the chance, by the folly and evils of dis'Union, or by long and exhaust ing war springing from the only great element of national discord among us. While it can not be foreseen exactly how much one huge ex ample of secession, breeding lesser dhfes indefi nitely, would retard. population, civilisation', and prosperity, no one can doubt that the ex tent of it would be very great and injurious; The proposed emancipation Would shorten the war, perpetuate peace, insane this increase of population, and proportionally the wealth of the country. With these, we should pay all the emancipation would cost, together with our other debt without it. If we had allowed our old national debt to run at six per cent, per annum, simple interest, from tho end of our revolutionary struggle until to-day, without paying anything ou either principle or interest, each man of us would owe less up on that debt now than each man owed upon it then; and this because our increase of men, through the wholo pfcriod, has been greater than six per cent., and has run faster than the interest upon tho dept. Thus, time alone re lieves a debtor nation, so long as its population increases faster than unpaid interest accumu lates ou its debt. Aud, notwithstanding this plan, therecom-' mcndation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may KfiOf >i emancipation, before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed.— Such would be only au advance part of the plan, and the came argument apply to both. This plan is recommended as a means, not in exclusion of, but in addition to, all others for restoring and preserving the national au thority throughout the Union. The subject is presented exclusively in its economical as pect. This plan would, lam confident, securo peace more speedily, and maintain it moro permanently, than can be done by force alone; while all it would cost considering amounts, and manner of payment, and times of pay trtSiU "■ 1 f %!•••* • Wtl© additional cost of the war, if we rely solely on force. It is much better; very much, that it would cost no, blood at all. This fact would be no excuse for delaying payment of what is justly due; but it shows the great importance of. time in this connexion —the great advantage of a policy by which wc shall not have to pay until wo number a hundred millions, what by a different policy We shall have to pay now, when we number but thirty-one millions. Ih a word, it shows that a dollar will be much harder to pay for the war than will be a dollar for emancipation on the proposed plan. And then the latter will cost no blood, no pfCciottt life. It will b a saving to,both. As to the second article, I thik it would be impracticable to return to bondage tho class of S croons therein contemplated. Borne of them oubtless, in tho property sense, belong to loyal owners; and hence, provision is made in this article for compensating auch. The third article relates to the future of the freed people. It does not oblige, but merely authorizes, Congress to aid in colonizing such as may consent. This ought not to be regar ded as objectionable, on Ore one hand, or on the other, in so much as it comes to nothing, unless by the mutual consent qf the people to be deported, and the American voters, through their representatives in Congress. I cannot make it better known than it al ready is, that I strongly favor colonization.— And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in tho couutry, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes maliciohs. It is insisted that their prcscnee would in jur o and displace white labor and white labor ers. If thoro oyer could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely Is not now. In times like the present men should utter nothing for which tney would not wil lingly be responsible thrbugh time and in e ternity, Id ft true, then; that•eeiored people can displace any moro White' labor, by being free, than by remaining iWves t If they stay in their old plaCe, they j<stie no white labor ers; if they le&vetbeir eld places, they leave theth Open to whitr laborers. Logieii IV, 'there is neither more nor less of ft. Emancipation, even without deportation, Would probably en hance the wages of white labor, and, very surely, would not reduoe them. Thus the customary umountof labor wonld still havo to be performed ; the freed people would surely not do more than their old proportion of it, and very probably, for a time, wonld do less, leav-' lug an increased part to white laborers, bring ing their labor into greater demand, and con sequently wages of it. with deportation,- even to a limited extent, enhanced wages to white labor is mathemati cally certain. Labor is like smy ether com modity in the market—increase the demand for it, and yen increase the price of ft. Be duec the supply of black labor, By colonizing the black laborer' out 6f the country, and, by precisely so much, you increase tho demand for and the wages of whiee labor. But it is dreaded that the hoed'people will swarm forth and cover {he whole, land.
