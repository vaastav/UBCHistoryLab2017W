But the strangest and most unpardon able omission of all is that he makes no reference whatever to the whisky frauds lately unearthed, and for which his friends McDonald, Joyce, and Avery are already in the penitentiary,, and Bah cock, his private Secretary, in danger. A little talk of reform in connection with this question would have been quite acceptable to thepeople, , But no, "mum's the word I" . The President does say he wants no war with Spain about Cuba, but attempts no explanation of the activity in the Navy Yards, in getting war vessels ready for sea. These subjects, quite proper for the President to write about, he carefully avoids, and steps out of his way to talk about matters he. has nothii.g to do with The debate in Congress on the cur rency question promises to 0111 early Mr. Blaine is announced as prepared to address me iiouse hi iengm tins ween, reviewing the erratic record of the Democratic party and press on the cur rency question since the war, and urging a steadfast and definite progrexs tnwiird resumption as the only one worthy of the Kepntiiiean party or tne country.

We have been permitted to peruse a letter from a resident of Newtown, Mont gomeryshire, England (North Wales), 'to a relative here, in which the distinguish ed Robert Owen was born and where he died, near eighteen years ago. It seems the residents of that town are agitating the erection of a monument in the marketplace and a memorial window of stained glass i.i the church, to honor his memory. Mr Owen was an earnest socialist, and spent some five hundred thousand pounds in projects to ameliorate the condition of laboring humanity;' He left his birth place when a youth and settled at New Lanark, Scotland, where he acquired bis great wealth in manu facturing.

Vi" d I . , On the eve of dOparturo of Hon. lit B. Payne to 'Washington to take his seat in the Rational House of Representatives, he was visited by a number of political and personal friendsand called upon him fof a speech, ,'rhe Plalndealcr gives a synopsis of his remarks from which we make the following extract: Mr. Pavne referred to the fact that when his name is called and entered up on the records of the House, it will be that of the first Democrat ever elected from this (the Cleveland) district, his predecessors having always been Whigs or Republicans. 1 : Mr, Payne said that much was expected from the next Mouse of Representatives-too much, perhaps from it, from the fact that there will be much inexperience1 amongst he' mem bers, but of one thing the people fnust rest assured that there ' would be a thorouuh scrutiny into the past manage ment of tlie different departments' of ihe government! and that .it, would bejhe aim';of the Democrats to bring abont ad ministrative .reform, and a reduction , in the enormous amount of expenditures, so beneficial, to the great army ot Kepuun qan ofiice-holders. ! Democrats should remember that the i President .! was against them and that the .Senate was still in the hands ot the mends 01 me aa ministration, and that their object would be to widen '.he breach that unfortunate ly seemingly existed between Democrats, but he trusted to the practical good seiisc of the Democratic members of Congress, and believed that such concessions of opinion would be made one to another, as would bring about that unity of action and harmony so desirable now to brine back the country to a firm foundation of honesty , and jnstice in public artairs. On the question of finance Mr.. Payne said that there were differences. 1 . He was not in favor of inflation, nor of un due contraction. He was not an ex treme man in his views upon this sub- iect. hut he believed his fellow citizens of the Democratic party, a large majority ,01 the business men ol , tne city, woiua agree with him on the necessity of the re peal of the law now as the i',' Sherman bill" providing for the resumption of specie payments in I8791 Keternng briefly to the impracticability of ' that measure he noted that he believed Dem ocratic statesmanship wonld yet light the way to an eventual return to the con stitutional currency of the country with out bringing shock and alarm to the bus iness interests of the country or want and suffering to the people , . . ; Plucked.

Mr. Bard was silent under this withering charge, which was annlaitded. and the Irish'! woman said. "Och hone ! I'm robbed. I'm I bat's a poor washerwoman that has gone bare- rooted in the winter to put mv money in here. O, the old robber ! They're all robbers I" Three or four members had the floor at once, shouting and yelling, and the feeling waxed warm, until it seemed that bloodshed would be ' the outcome. Dlivis said he did not believe that Russell was alone to blame in this matter, and he was for bringing a crimi nal prosecution against the otlicers. Thus the confusion kent ud until midnight, and out of it all came amotion instruct ii g the committee that had reported to act with the Attorney of the Association ami other legal counsel in such manner as to secure the Society from loss.'

And vet no dispatches disclosed during the trial had more conclusive ear m irks of conspiracy, man tne responses of Joyce, who looking through his pris on bars, still declares his innocence, are, like those constructed by Babcock, pre- prepared so as to . conceal intorma- tion.
