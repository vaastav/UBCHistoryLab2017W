After a long and outer nrgument the court promptly ruled with tho state ami oinlPi-Art the cuse to jiroceed. This left tho defense with no fur ther right to object to, talesmen who could qualify to the satisfaction or the state and tho court. 'But tho delcm did object, and Attorney Pierce, for the defense, lecnme so veijemeiit that. Judge I Jones finally said: 'The' court has been very patient and lenient thus far, but unless Mr. Pierce eeases from his attempts to vlolato the court's rullnj? the court will exerclso Its right to remove Mr. Pierce from tho case and appoint other counsel to conduct tho exami nation."

Just half of tho jurors are citizens of rnlon City, tho others being rcsldonts of towns In the vicinity Not a slnglo resident ot the Reelfoot I.ako region was selected.
