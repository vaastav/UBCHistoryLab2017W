iflincml point tribune. THURSDAY, DEC. 9, I - at the post-office in Mineral Point." is as geoond-class matter. W. n. & 2. J. BENNETT, Editors. Trouble began at Washington Monday. Jamaica ginger saloons are fre quent in the alleged prohibition states at the sonth. Jamaica ginger is about as able an intoxicant as Mexican pulque, if taken in sufficient quantities. Before leaving for Washington, Senator Sawyer presented Win nebago Lodge of Odd Fellows, at Oshkosh, the sum of S9OO to be used in paying for their handsome new building on Algorna street. The last session of Congress was nine months long, while the session which convened on Monday will be three months. If it shall do only a third as much work as the last it will require the aid of a strong microscope to see the result of its labors. The anti-saloon convention in Cortland, N. V., last week adopted the name of “New York State Tem perance Republican League,” and decided to include high license among the measures of temperance progress. Ellen J. Foster, of lowa, spoke in the evening, after which the convention adjourned. There arc only two children in the state school at Sparta as yet. The various county officers seem rather slow in sending the children. Several counties have written to ascertain if they cannot send more than the two determined on by the state board. As soon as the coun ties are heard from an apportion ment will be made and the counties permited to send more than two children apiece. Benjamin T. Frederick, Dem ocratic member of Congress from the Fifth District of lowa, has sent his resignation to Governor Lar abee, because, as he declares in a letter to President Cleveland, ho has been unhandsomely snubbed by the Postmaster General in the mat ter of official appointments. Mr. Frederick was defeated at the late election as a candidate for re-election to the next Congress. The year Iss<J seems destined to go into history as the great strike year. The Commissioner of Labor Statistics for New York reports that up to the present time he has | received information of 1,000 strikes in that State, llis last annual! report made mention of but .-2, al though there were some not re ported, The record of other States would probably show a similar re markable increase in the number of strikes. The Slate board of canvassers completed the official count on the 4th insl , and the plurality of each of tin' State officers and congress men is as follows: Rusk, is,7is; IT land, 14,099; Timme, I", 452; llarshaw, 1 1,799; Kstabrook, 15,109; Thayer, 19,106; Peterson, 15,266; Cheek, 11,7*2; For congressmen Caswell, 579; Guenther, 1,228; La Follelte, 9,5 10; Smith, 5,710; lludd, 5,51*; Clark, 4,467; Thomas, 4,809; Price, 12,007; Stephenson, 1,753. For the woman suffrage amend ment, 4,553. Tiikkk is a report in Cleveland, I Ohio, and it is quite generally eir- | cu'tiled throughout that city, to the effi et that Senator Jones, of Flor-1 ida, who for a year or more lias | been endeavoring to secure rec ognition from a millionairess in De troit, has abandoned that field and is now seeking the hand of the widow of James \. Cartield. It is understood that Mis. Carliold gives him no encouragement, yet he is a persistent man and ther is one chance in a million that he will lead the rich widow t• the altar. I‘rokkssoh Kosikk, the 1/mrl, rye meteorologist, predicted a storm of unusual severity Due. 5, to be follow ed by other tierce winter storms, forming a storm period from Dee. 5 to the ITth—regular blizzards, with high winds, snow blockads, and very low temperature. These predieaions are made, he says, upon the position of Venus relitive to the earth, and Mercury relative to the ! sun. The Professor claims that his j late predictions have been verified to I the letter. It will be well, therefore, to make a note of his last forecast and see what will come of it. The death of Congressman Win. T. Price, the representative of the Eighth Congressional district of this state, occurred at his home in Rlack River Falls, Monday morn ing. Mr. Price was in his 69d year of his age, and came to this state, when a young man, from Pennsyl vania. Me engaged in lumbering and had amassed a fortune. From an early period lie took an active part in politics. He has served as county judge, was a member of the assembly two terras, of the senate four terms, and was or e of the presidential electors in 1868. He was elected to congress in 1882, re elected in 1884, and again elected the present year. He returned from Washington at the close of the last congress with impaired health, but was not considered dan gerously ill until a short time prev ious to the election. If is malady was cancer of the stomach. In the language of the Inter Ocean we can but declare the Presi dent’s message to Congress upon its convening, “a model of adriot ness.” We do not say that it is in sincere; wo merely remark that it is evasive. It is full of good points, hut they are points that would have been as good in an after-dinner speech to a non-partisan body of politicians as in an address to Con gress. The President recapitulates all that everybody knew, and indi cates all that everybody believed. He suggests nothing. Briefly, the President’s message is a not inele gant peaces verbal of the present domestic conditions and foreign re lations of the country. It contains nothing over which the Bourbon Democracy can be rapturous, noth ing at which the Mugwumps can take violent fright. It says nothing about civil-service reform. The Mugwumps can construe silence into consent, and the Democrats into contempt of the doctrines of advanced reform. It is a message whose caution may prevent severe criticism, but where vigor will not excite enthusiasm. And it leaves him free to avow or disavow the revolutionary tendencies of his Secretary of the Treasury. 

WASHINGTON LETTER. From our regular correspondent. Congress has meet, the President has sent in his message, and the Cabinet reports are launched on the public, us usual. While it was pretty well known what the President would say on certain important sub ji els,every body w as wondering what new contributions he would make to English phraseology through his second annual document. It is pos sible that ho exhausted his original ity on “goulish glee,” hut it is not at all certain, fur equally remarkable combinations have been evolved since he was delivered of “iuoouous desuetude.” There is nothing Jeffersonian or simple about these phrases or about “pern'u ions activity,” “offensive par tisanship,” “structural weakness,” etc,, but this Administration has or iginated other things than phrases. The odor of boiled cabbage has set tled around the White House, min gled with the scent of chrysanthe mums. It cannot be charged that there is anything aristocratic about this continuation. It was only an indication of true simplicity and it tli ated into the corridors and parlors of the mansion at one of the public receptions last week, so offending the nostrils of some of the Presi dent's visitors that they quickly sought the outdoor air. Now a | great many people who go to the W lute House for business or pastime j will not like tills innovation, hut the peopl. cannot have a Democratic Administration without new fash | ions. The President has been allowed to take very little comfort from the possession of a country home. The real estate speculators have sur rounded his premises and the atmos phere is tilled with all sorts of schemes for improvements at the public expense. \V hether or not the President :s concerned in these plans, his purchase has laid him open to the suspicion of people who | are not slow to question the motives | of public men, and if he wants to ; be left in quiet under his own vine and figtree he will have to plant them at a much greater distance from Washington. He is sure to be the target for malicious gossip as long as he holds his present property. There have been some very large sales of property during the past week on the line of the proposed Massachusetts avenue extention and cable road which is expected to get a charter at the next session of Con gress People holding little farms in that vicinity imagine they have a bonanza, and land which would have been eagerly sold at lil 00 an acre a year ago, is now held at a thousand dollars or more. The bub ble may burst any day, but except in western mining towns, there is no record of so sudden a rise of prop erly in value as has lately occurred northwest of this city. One of the latest stories about General Logan is that he has made a fortune in real estate here and that he is making a fortune out of his book. The rumor may have risen from the fact that one of the Senator’s sons has gone into the real estate business in Washington, which any man can do who can raise money enough to pay his of fice rent. Senator Logan is by no means a rich man yet, although his book is doing well, and whatever be his landed possessions in Illinois and Chicago he has bought no real estate in Washington with the ex ception of “Calumet Place,” the old stone mansion on the hill in the suburbs, which is his residence, and which is not yet entirely paid for. The citizens of Washington have been considerably excited during the past week over the demoraliza tion and disintegration of the Police Department and its attendant scan dals. A good many sympathize with the overthrown Chief and be lieve him to have been the victim of the conspiracy he outlines. A good many more, perhaps, sympathize with Arnold and Kelly. On the other hand little sympathy is ex pressed for Edelin, the disseminator of the scandal, who seems to glory in the ruin he has caused. “Well,” said he exultantly, “if I did have to go, I took him with me,” referring to the Chief (Major Walker.) The President will now have to make another trial to secure a Chief of Police possessing the proper qualifications for the head of the force of the Capital of the Nation. Members of Congress can enjoy the unmolested freedom of the city without restrictions as to localities and those who can impose them selves on the police as Congressmen or members-elect of the next House will also be allowed the free run of the city this session. Striking Against American Boys. The Flatilmoro glass-blowers have struck, but not for an increase of wages. They struck against an in crease in the number of apprenti ces. American workingmen, thro’ their trades unions, may bar the doors of the factories and work shops against American lads who would like to learn trades, and would do so if they had an oppor tunity, hut they are powerless to shut off the supply of skilled and ill-paid mechanics from foreign lands. These are coming, and will continue to come so long as wages here are higher than in the coun tries where they live. Meantime, the question what to do with American hoys is one of j constantly growing importance and serious discussion. Industrial schools are starting up here and there, have met with encourage ment, and are accomplishing ex cellent results in teaching boys and girls the arts of handicraft. It would be belter, however, because it would be cheaper, for them to learn those things in the actual workshop. In this way their edu cation would be more practical, and be gained without leaving home, and, instead of being a source of expense, would produce a small in come. The glass-blowers and other labor organizations ought to be able to see this apprenticeship mat ter in its true light.—Chicago Jour- I mil. \ Itfiiturkuble (iood ’lan. !- tie who attends to the com tort of his time 1 itv ami will not lot lit- little ones suffer with affection of the throat and lungs, whereby t in, i,- lives ni.iv be endangered, but vrlioshoukl a' all roll - give tbom that - .vereigo remedy Kemp’s Balsam Price .Weenieand f\. trial 1 P/.e free.
