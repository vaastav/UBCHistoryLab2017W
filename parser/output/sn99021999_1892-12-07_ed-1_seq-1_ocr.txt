There never has been a time in our history when work was so abundant or when wages were so high , whether measured by the cur rency in which they are paid or bj their power to supply the necessaries and comforts of life. It is true that the market prices of cotton and wheat have been low. It is one of the .unfavorable incidents of agriculture that the farmer cannotprodueoupon orders. He must sow and reap in ignorance of the aggregate production of the year , and is peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows overproduction. Hut while the fact 1 have stated is true as to the crops I have mentioned , the general n\erage of prices has been such as to give to agriculture a fair participation in tlie general prosperity. The value of our total farm products has increased from $ l,8Gi4G.Gti : ! ( ! in 1MJO to ? 4HXUIX,000 ) ) in Ib'.ll ' , as estimated by statisticians , an increase of 2i ! ( ) per cent.

If any are discontented with their state here ; if any believe that the wages or prices , the returns'for honest toil , are inadequate they should not fail to remember that there is no other country in the world where llio conditions that seem to them hard would not be accepted as highly prosperous.

A petition presented by Mr. 1'effer from the clti/.ens of ICnnsas alleging the existence of a combination between elevators , millers and railroads of Minneapolis and St.jos \ \ \ to depreciate the price of grain raised the question as to what disposition should be made of it. The vice president intimated thai as llio null-options bill bad been reported the petition should go lo the table , hut Messrs. Paddock , Washbiirn and Harris favored ils reference to the committee on agriculture and it. was referred. Several bills were introduced and referred , among them the following : Hy Mr. Hate- To repeal all statutes relating to supervisors of election and special deputies , lly Mr. Chandler For the suspension of immigration for one year. Hy Mr. Vest To. create a bu reau In the Department of Agriculture for the giving of public information as to the product and shipping of live stock. Mr. Vest also introduced a joint resolu tion wbicli he said lie would call up tomor row for the appointment by the president of the United States of throe commissioners to confer with the proper authorities of tlio live civili/.ed tribes on the Indian Territory . .with a view to making such an agreement ami ar rangement as will induce tlicm to take home steads In severally and sell the remainder of their lands to the United States. Mr. Vest offered a resolution reciting al legations in the public press charging gross misconduct on the p.irt of census employes , especially enumerators in the state of Mis souri , who are said to have taken lists of voters for partisan use. and also charging that certain clerks of the census bureau had been sent to the stale of New York during Ibe election to perform partisan service , and directing an investigation of such charges by tbe senate coinmitleo of the eleventh census. Mr. Hale , chairman of tbo census com mittee , saiil that bo presumed there would be no objection to the proposed investlga- lion. Ho could not help thinking that tbe senator from Missouri had been led into offering the resolution by what would bo found to be a matter of no substance. The great census bureau bad done an Immense work , with but very lltlle political bias. Mr. Vest referred to the arrest of a census oflicial in Albany , N. Y. , for an attempt to induce ! !

Mr. Mitchell Docs the senator think tbe result of tbo voting in New York showed that democrats had been kept from the polls ?

COMMISSION ; Its .Yiiinml ICi'pnrt To Ki-talhitit on ( 'iiiniitii Wellington Not < > 4. WASHINGTON. D. C. , Dec. ( ! . The Civil Service commission calls attention to the systematic efforts made in various states to collect assessments from government em ployes. In all tlio cases it promptly pub lished the facts in full and handed the testi mony over to the attorney general. The commission declares that the classified ser vice should bo extended as rapidly as prac ticable. As , for instance , to clerks anil writers in navy yards , to tlio Internal reve nue service , to custom louses with twenty- live employes and to free delivery post olllces. The National Letter Carrier association acting In its capacity of a branch of the Knights of Labor have recommended thai , nil free delivery olllccrs bo classified. Bui , letter carriers are Just like other American citucns. They want to feel that when thej do tlio work of the public honestly , zealously and intelligently they should not bo made the sport of lo.-al political bosses. The commission also urges the adoption ol a new classification of the customs ami posta services and a modification of the rules si that the number of excepted places and nl places subject to noncompelitive examination may bo greatly reduced in all branches o , tlic service. The coiniujfision thinks the ex ( 'options from examination in any postolllci may be properly limited to the postmaster assistant postmaster , cashier , private secre tary and perhaps superintendent of tin money order division. In tlio sumo way tin number of cxceptcd places in llio departnien at Washington should bo greatly reduced Very serious harm , in tlio commission1 ! judgment , results from allowing the chief : of divisions to bo excepted from examination and it thinks they .should bo put under tin general rule ami bo appointed by a promo lion from within the .service. ( Ictllng Hack ut CiiniKlii. A bill Introduced by Mr. Fryo In the sen il ate today smacks very strongly of retalla ills lion and at the present time is of moro thai lso usual interest. It amends the laws regu iir luting the transportation of goods by ik it daring that no merchandise shall bo Irani- ss ported from one part of the United States t 111 any part of the United States In a vessi ! it belonging wholly or in part to a subject o itr any foreign | Kwer , and such transportatlo r- via any foreign jwrt shall bo deemed a vioki lion of law. Tim sailing of any foreign vcs sel from any United Stales port to nnothe is not prohibited provided no merchandis other than that ini | > ortcd In such vessel froi a foreign iwt shall bo carried from one jxn to another of the United States. The bill provides that the president ma.\ by proclamation , suspend the right of currj Ing merchandise In bond through the Unite States provided for in the bill , in case th Dominion of Canada should at any time dt prive the citizens of the United States of Hi use of canals in the Dominion In terms of in equality with Canada , sis provided by artlcl xxv of the treaty of Washington.

Third I'urty I'liuim-liil The ilnuudul theories of the third part were cmphaslred today In n bill Introduced liv Mr. OIU of Kansas , having the voliiml- nlous title : "To Change Our Monetary System.

All money specified shall bo full legal tender , provided thai fractional currency shall IA > legal tender Iu such to the amount of $ , " > blnn , \ one transaction. In addition to the provisions for free coinage in the previous bill , this measure provides that tbo money paid for Iho bullion In the treasury shall IM. ' covered Into the treasury of the " fund.

The secretary of the treasury is directed to prepare an amount of paper money not lo exceed in volume M per cent of the assessed value of tbo real estateof the United States , as shown in the last census , to be held in the general treasury as the " .states Improve ment fund , ' ' and only to be paid out on the oilier of the respective governors and secre taries of state. Any state may avail itself of the provis ions of this act by joint resolution of the legislature , and the stale is required lo pay lo the United States an annual tax of 1 per cent on all sums drawn and retained during each year and to open and keep in operation an exchange and general deposit department at tbe capital of the slate. A bill to "Protect American Worklngmcn , " is the tille of a measure introduced iu tbo house today by Hepresentiillve Chipman of Michigan. According to its provisions no alien who is a non-resident of tbe United States shall work at any mechanical trudo or any manual labor within tlio borders of the United States. Mr. Harter of Ohio Introduced a bill in the house today that treats the financial question in a novel way. It provides for the cessation of silver bullion pur chases on January 1 , 1MM , and for the sale of UHl.OOO.OOO ounces of silver bullion for gold. Mr. Harter thinks the continu ance of pun-liases of silver would only in crease tile ultimate enormous loss of the country growing out of tlio act of March , 1STS ; that these purchases were destroying confidence at home and abroad and stand In the pathway of national prosperity today. The cessation of these purchases of silver would , he thinks , cause a renewal of foreign purchases of American securities upon a a large scale , and the repeal of the present law would start gold Jlroin Europe toward America. The president today sent to the senate a large number of appointments made during the . recess. _ , _ _ _ Sioux City Hunk ( im-x Into l.liiililntlon. |

The Public Ledger building at Sistli and Chestnut streets was almost grttted this evening by lire. The damage by tire was confined lo tbo composing room on'tho top floor , but a tor rent of water Hooded every floor in the structure. The loss is approximated at be tween $3.-i,000 ( ) and SHO.OOO. The Ledger building is a live-story stone block. The lire originated at 0 o'clock in tlio basement and went through the air shaft , spreading to the top story. The files of tbo pajjer were all saved and tbe many costly articles in llio olllces were all canied out. In tbe meantime a do/.cn streams of water bad been turned on the lire in the cellar and the flames there were soon extinguished. The Humes in the composing room had been playing havoc. Tlio lire burst through the roof and shot up in a great column toward the sky. About this time Mi" Childs arrived. He posted him self in the doorway of Hie court house across the street from the burning building and watched bis building go up inflames. Ho said be lilted to watch tbe lire. While the firemen wore at work they were spurred to greater efforts by the promise of Mr. Childs to distribute fflOt ) among them for their gallant work. Neither was Mr. Childs unmindful of the firemen's comforts for be provided them with what they wished at a neighboring restaurant.

The international monetary conference resumed its sitting today and continued its discussion of the report of the committee which examined into the Kothscblld proposals. Sir Klvers Wilson , who said bis views were entirely shared by Sir C. Fi-oemantlo , deputy master of the British treasury , said : "Now , we believe that all the governments who have delegates here recognize tbo presence of a great danger. A note of warning has reached us from America , and , to say the least , it is doubtful whether tbe American government can continue in definitely the gigantic efforts It has fruit lessly undertaken for so many years to main- lain and raise the price of silver. We need not Inquire whether the policy which gov erned Ibu currency legislation of the great republic was wise In conception , but It can not bo denied that it has not realized expec tations and is greatly the cause of our pres ent positions. "In any case , the suspension of American silver purchases has become n practical question of the day. and if it occurred might lead to the suspension of coinage in India. Certain high authorities believe tlm sudden cessation of purchases of silver by America and Ihe closing of India's minis would lead to heavy falls of silver and n disastrous dis turbance of commerce. Others contend that the fall is already discounted , and that the removal of the uncertainty at present weigh ing on the market , would have u quieting effect and bring stability. Wlmt ( in-at llrltnlii Wants. "In view of those divergent ideas , what course should be adoptedf A plan might doubtless be worked out whieh.would bo more or less n continuance of the American experiment , in the hope of sin-ceding where America failed , or wo may do nothing , leav ing the ratio between gold and silver to settle itself. Naturally our instructions re quire us , before concluding that matters must be left ns they are , to examine with tbo greatest care any plan submitted for the purpose of extending the monetary use of silver. , to "In order to avoid a misuuderstaridiiig , 1 desire to state that Sir Charles Freemantle and myself are pure niono-inclullisls and do not admit that any other system than a single gold standard is applicable in Great Hritain. We have thus far studied only the Kothschild and Levi plans , and are willing lo admit Unit the adoption of cither , or both , would not bo incompatible witli our princi ples ; but is it enough that these schemes are defensible in principle ? Wo ask our selves whether either would have tbo least chance of meeting with a preponderance of support that would justify us in recommending the British gov ernment to consider it. The Holhsohild plan has not received such support , and this is sufficient to decide us to abslain from u dis cussion of its details which we know will be fruitless. Tbo Levi proposal would involve the wilhdrawal of llio half sovereign , so it would be equally fruitless to discuss that plan , since Great Drilain is unwilling to submit to Hiicli inconvenience unless pre sented in conjunction with a plan offering advantages which all Ihe powers recognize. "Another plan may , however , bo forinu- lalcil and approved by the conference , and if it docs not conflict with the principles wo have laid down it will receive serious con sideration from tbo British government. " AsliS Too Ulni-li of Ainri-k'ii. Mr. James B. McCreary of tbo United Stales delegation proceeded to point out tbo diniculties and perils of Iho existing silua- liou. lie said Unit whatever was tbe cause tlio fact remained that a remedy was im peratively needed. Ho appreciated tlio at tention which Mr. Itothsohild has given to the important business of the conference , but be colud not support tbo do Hothschild plan , i " 1 cannot admit , " ho said , "that it is just the proper remed.s for America to continue to purchase fiUAHMKK ) ounces of silver annu ally at tbe price not to. exceed 100 cents on tbe dollar , on condition that Knropcan powers make purchases yearly to thu amount of 5,000.000 pounds for live years at a price not to exceed ! ! pence per ounce. And that if silver should raise above Unit price , pur chases lo be immediately suspended. I can not see why wo in America should bo required to pay UK ) cents on tbo dollar if necessary , while tlio European powers pay only 7l ! cents on the dollar. It seems an unequal distribution thai we should bo oxpeoled to purchase twice as much silver as Kurope. The object of the conference should be not to fix a price which would keep silver below par , but to enlarge the use and restore it to a parity with tbe value it bad with gold prior to 1KTM , when it was llrst outlawed. Mr. do Hotbscbild's statement that if the conference should dis solve without definite result , silver would depreciate to a frightful extent , perhaps leading lo a monetary panic , is very signifi cant , but his plan seems to bo Insiifiicicnt to meet tlio grave siluatlon be predicts , and is inadequate as a remedy for decreasing prices and distress in agriculture. " Willing to lii-siuni ) u Double , Slamlurcl. Mr. McCroary then referred to the com plaints of the British Chamber of Commerce quoted lo recent declarations of Archhistiop Walsh ami Mr. A. .1. Hal four and contended that tlio silnalloii demanded a broader re cognition and a bettor remedy than that suggested by Mr. Do Holhschlld. The American delegates , lie said , worn ready to co-oporato with the other delegates in a candid and earnest effort to maintain the monetary standard of both metals. Therefore after submitting tlio general plan of bi-niol- iiillsin , favored by America , they also submitted the plan favored by them selves. It was a plain business proposal and If it were adopted the necessary details could bo easily arranged. It announced no new theory and proposes no untried syste.m. U only opened a way to return to the time- tried and lime-honored system under which gold and silver were for many years par and wore equal Instruments In exchange. Acts of Parliament , laws of congress and edicts ol monarcbs had changed the real value of Uui metals. If an International agreement re stored silver to all Its former privilege's anil powers , as money on a fair and just ratio. parity of value of the metals would soon be established. II should be understood thai tbo American delegates bad no powei to bind their country. They were author ized to consult the other delegates for tlu purpose of elucidating and solving the Im portant problem , and if a solution wiu agreed upon , they were to report the rosuli to their government , and congress wouh take such action as would give such validity to the work as seemed proper. In ordei that the situation in the United State ; should bo fully known , Mr. McCreary ex plained the position of the ditVoronl polillca parties , and added that ho believed that tin > ooplo In general , without regard to JKJ ll itlcal affiliation , endorsed the America ) plan. lilt IVisonal Opinion.

This , in my opinion , is n system that would give unity and stability to the value of money and would furnish the best remedy for the exist ing evils from which all ilvllizcd nations are suffering. " Mr. de Hothschlld followed Mr. McCreary. He said that as America would not support his propositions , lie considered that it would be most In accordance- with the respect duo the conference to withdraw them , Ilou loiRtmiit Wii * Comrrtril. Sir C. P. Molesworth. one of the delegates for India , combated the theory that ( Jreat Itrltain owed her commercial superiority to the gold-r.tandard. On the contrary , he de clared Unit the gold standard from first to last had been a source of inconvenience and danger. Oreat Drilaln had been mved from serious danger only by the bimetallism of France. Notably this had been the case when Kuropo was Hooded with California and Australian gold. The whole question required to be examined from the point of view of Industrial Interests as well as that of the monetary and financial interests. He regretted that Industrial Interests bad not been moro strongly represented in Iho con- , ferenco. Another ilulioi-i : : ( ( > IMiin. Sir William llouldsworth. one of the Hrlt- Hritlsh delegates , then presented his plan. He said that his plan was not a new one , as it bad been suggested to every monetary conference. He assumed that Franco , the Latin union and America would support such a plan , and it only remained to be seen to what extent the gold standard countries could supiMirt it. He proposed Unit n bi metallic union should bo formed by nations willing to enler into such an agreement , and that nations preferring to retain a single gold standard should undertake to establish the following or a similar agreement , viz : That their mints should receive silver bul lion iu not less iiiantit\ ] than a llxcd mini mum against receipts , the quantity and value at a speeilld rate per ounce , to be de termined by international agreement , the quantity so spccilied to bo deliuTed by weight to bearer whenever demanded , and in no other manner or any other account whatsoever , the receipts to circulate as money. He said be believed that receipts would circulate at par and be used ns bank reserves , and that so long as the mints of the bimetallic union were open to the free coinage of silver the ratio would be main tained between gold and silver coin in the union and bring gold and silver receipts In other countries.

Mayhor poison ing case is creating intense interest through out Fremont county , though many of the re ports sent out are greatly exaggerated. The report published Sunday that the grave of the fourth wife of Mayhor , formerly Miss I nnp , who died suddenly about three years ago , had been opened and found empty was purely imaginary , it Is probiblo : that the coroner will order the disinteruient within a , few da.\s in obedience to public sentiment. The report that a mob was being organized at Thnrnmn , the home of Mr. Lamp , father- in-law of Mayhor's fourth wife , is denied by prominent clti/.ens at Thunnan. The sheriff prudently placed additional giwrd.s around the jail , but he fears no danger from any mob and It is believed the law will bo al lowed to take its course. Tin- grand Jury is investigating the case and will probe it to the bottom. A large number of witnesses has been subpinmcd , and the evidence is said to bo startling. The counsel m\y an in dictment will be found. Mayhor will be defended by Lawyer C. S. Keonaii of Sbenandoali , to whom Mayhor baa deeded the line sixt j-acre homestead , where his last wife recently died in great agony. It is probable that Lawyer ICeenan will make an application for a change of venueas the belief in the guilt of Mayhor is undoubtedly held by a large majority of the people in Fremont county. A few personal friends of the accused man strongly assert his inno cence. holdlnir to the theory of Mayhor that is wife took the strychnine herself with nicidal intent. The whole case is cnvel- pcd In mystery and startling incidents are 'onstantly ' being revealed. When in the custody of the ofllclals at { tvertnii.

Dr. Conger of Kivcrton , who Is not only be family physician of Mayhor but the 'alber-in-lawof Hcorgo Mnyhor the eldest .on of the accused man , arrived attlio bed- ideofMrs. Mayhor about thirty minutes .fter her death , lie said at once that the .voinan . had died from strychnine poison , and Mayhor indignantly denied that there was n.v strychnine about the place.

Dr. Conger , by reason ) f his relationship to Gooriro Mayhor , who s \oung man of line character , is reticent , ' n discussing the tragedy , but be is per- mailed that Mayhor administered the poison 0 his wife.
