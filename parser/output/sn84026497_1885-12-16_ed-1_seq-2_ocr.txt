EDITOR. WEDSESDAl KQR31R DEC. 1G, HSi. L - I SYNOPSIS OF THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Tho following sjntipai will give an idea of PretideDt Cleveland's first message to Congreoi. He peo with a tender allusion to the death of Vice President Hendricks. , POKEIQX RKLATIONa. A general survey shows that our re lations with foreign powers coDlioue to be friendly. Concerning the Isth mus canal the president says such a highway must bo removed from the chance of domination by any single jxwer, and roust bo for the world's benefit, a trust for maukiod. 

TAVORS A REDUCTION or CU8T0M3 DUTIK8. On the report of the Secretary of the treasury, the president favors a re duction of the customs duties on the necessaries of life, for the reason that the revenue eicetds the needs of the government. AS TO THE SILVER DOLLAR. On the coinage question, the presi dent says that experience proves that it is next to impossible to put into cir culatian the nlvtr dollar, and that disaster will attend the continuation of its coinage. He favors legislation tending tt a ceisation of tho coinage vT silver dollars. He says, "prosperi ty hesitates upon our threshold be--cause of the dangers oDd uncertain ties surrounding this question. Capi tal timidly shrinks from trade, invest ors are unwilling to take the chance of the questionable shape in which their money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts, a risk against which care and sagacious management do uot protect." OUR 

BEFENCELES3 BEA COAST. Reviewing the report of the secre tary of war, (he president recommends reform in court martial proceedings, a remedy for the present delenceless po sition of our sea coasts and a law pro hibiting the construction of bridges over navigable waters in such manner as to obstruct navigation. THE 

NAVY. Referring to our navy, lie- expresses the hope that the day is not far dis tant when we will have a navy such as befits our standing among nations. "But before we proceed further in the restoration of the navy we need a thoroughly reorganized navy depart ment." He earnestly recommends the suggestions of Secretary Whitney in .that respect. OF POSTAL AFFAIRS. ' Of postal affairs he says that the anticipated revival of postal revenues has been oppressed and retarded by the unfavorable business condition of the country, of which the postal ser vice is a faithful indicator. The grat ifying fact, however, is marked that returning prosperity is showu by a gain of $380,000 in the revenue of the Jatter half of the last year, over the corresponding period of the precediug year, and be confidently anticipates, mat even tbe present low rates, now as favorable as any in the world, will yet be adequate to sustain the cost of the service. 

OCEAN SUBSIDIES. Of ocean subsidies, be thinks that congress should determine the amounts and the beueficiaries, if it iutends (bat such gifts of public money are to be made to aid enterprises in the sup pnsbd interest of the public. The president endorses the plan suggested by the attorney general in his report to relieve the over burdened courts of the United States, and favors paying U. S. marshals and district attorneys, instead of compensating by fees. THE 

INDIAN QUESTION. Of the Indian question he favors the appointment of six commissioners, three of whom should be from the ar- . my, to carefully inspect the Indians, with a view of discovering their exact condition and needs, and determining what steps shall be taken by the gov. ernment to improve their situation. CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. Of civil service reform, the presi . i in . jeoi nopes mat we eiiau never again be remitted to the system which die tributes public positions purely as re wards for par'isau service. The al lurements of an immeuse number of offices and places exhibited to the vot ers of the land, and the promise of their bestowal iu recognition of paiti van. activity, debauch the suffrage and J. K. WENK, rob political action of its thoughtful and deliberate character, t Civil ser vice reform," he said, "came n ne too soon to check the progress of political demoralisation." rOLYOAMT. Of polygamy, he says there is no feature of it, or the system which sanc tions it, which is not opposed to all that is of value in our institutions. There should be no relaxation in the execution of the law now in operation, and he will gladly approve of further discreet legislation which will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame. OTHElt MATTERS. He urges prompt action to secure accommodation and protection for the capilol library, nnd fiually urges un immediate amendment of the law re lating to the presidential succession, A PATRIOTIC COXCIA'BION. In conclusion he says: "I commend to the wise care and thoughtful atten tion of cnngiess the needs, the welfare aud the aspirations of a generous and intelligent nation, To subordinate these to the narrow advantages of par tisanship for the accomplishment of selfish aims is to violate the peoples' trust and destroy the peoples' interests. But an individual sense of responsi bility on the part of each of us, and a stern determination to perform our duty well, must give us place among those who have added in their day and generation to the glory and pros perity cf our beloved land." The President'! Message. It will be a source of great gratifi cation tit judicious citizens without distinction of party, that the first an nual message of President Cleveland fully sustains the promise made iu his inaugural address, and the reading of it will go far to assure the public miud, that so far as the President's individ ual inilueuce can go to guard the pub lic welfare against the evils of ill-considered aud violent chauge of policy, the country is sa'e. It is no mean achievement which the President has accomplished, that he has wrung from honest political opponents, naturally fearful of the consequences of his ac cession to power under the circum stances, avowals of confidence in the integrity of his purpose and intelli gent conception of the public needs. The great leugtb of the message is its only serious defect, and that only be cause it substantially debars the gen eral newspaper from pn scuting it at leugth to its readers. Iu the presen tation nf the various topics of com mon interest, it treats of them iu such a broad spirit of non-partUanBhip and progeasive appreciation of their im portance that we have to keep our minis steadily on the fact that we are reading the views of a Democratic President, to avoid the impression tint we are reading tho message of a Republican President fully imbued with traditions of his party, lie speaks in no uncertain terms of the enormity of the wrongs perpetrated upon the Chinese in the far West and the obligations to briug the perpetrat ors to justice. While we do oot agree with him in the vast importance he gives to the necessity for tbe reduction of revenue, especially from customs dutiee, tint care with which he guards hU recomrucJatiocs iu that diiection by urging that tho subject be dealt witb "in such a manner as to protect the interests ot American labor" re cures us, if be can restrain the wild theorists nf his party, against serious disaster. His treatmeut of the sub ject of silver coinage is bold, vigorous aud conclusive, and cauuot be disre gardud with impunity. Of the Mor mon question he treats with the plain truthfulness which indicates no spirit of compromise with the remaining "Twin rttlio of barbarism." On the topic of civil service reform tho same plain, blunt aud vigorous style pre vails as in all the rest, which shows that be writes exactly what be believes in, aud what he iuteuds, to the exteut to which he can conipuss it, to enforce. There are points upon which we could criticise him, but where they are so few and unimportant, we prefer to pass them by, feeling suro that if be can wield euougU iiitiucnce in his par ty to mould it to Lis views, La will have made a better, truer, more na tional Democratic party than was ever expected to have been seen in this country again.
