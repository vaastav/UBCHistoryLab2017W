Tho report of the Commissioner of Inter nal Kovenue (Mr. Delano) shows that the receipts from all source*, exclusive of the tax on hank circulation and deposits, for the fiscal year ending Juno 30, 1809, were slt-0.0i>9,344.t*9. The tax on bunks, which j* collected by the Treasurer of the United States, has been previously reported at ;m'T.993.AT. The total receipts from inter nal taxes are,therefore, slo.V>jrvkJ7.r<J, or nearly eleven millions in excess of the esti mate of Commissioner Wells last year—an estimate based.as heremarked,“on a system of revenue administration which, to use a vtrv mild expression, has been exceedingly imperfect. The receipts from customs (wo tufty ol»sorve parenthetically) are like wise ten millions larger than Mr. Wells* es timate of Ust year, amounting to $180,010,- 410. From these two items we may in fer that tho total receipts of tho Treasury from all sources, for the fiscal year, have l**en alKMit $377,000,000, again at for tho previous year. This, iu virw of the largo reduction of intomal tans lest year, is a very gratifying exhibit, fr.xnit.bing a surplus of more than $40,000.- over and above the current expenses of the government and the interest on the public debt. Commitsioner Delano furnishes us two tables, showing the collections from the dif ft-rctit sources of internal revenue fur the years Imß and IBd9 t with the jiereeatagc of gain or loss. From these tables wo learn that In the first half of the fiscal year 18»59 there was a gain of 100 per cent in the re ceipts from distilled spirits, and in tho last half of the year a gain of Ist per cent, not withstanding the reduction of tho tax from two dollars to fifty rents per gallon. The gain on spirits daring the first six mouths was and in tbe second six months $1t*,784,249. There was, however, a considerable falling off in the receipts from incomes. The returns for so much of the current year as has passed are equally promising; for the six months ending September;;!), Ijoi’.i, the aggregate receipts wore $1(M,:;77,- ‘.‘.'u, against for the same n-obtlis in Jm;>. The increase ia Uio re ceipts from the tax on spirits alone is over 51 i.inrti.iN.o; on tobacco, ;on incomes, S;*,77:MH)O. Thu increase in the receipts from the tax on spirits is somewhat due to the fact that the whiskey in ware- Louse since August. isdS. had to be with drawn prior to July 1. Ist’.'.i, and the tax paid. There is a steady gain m Iho receipts jr.-in the tax on tobacco. The total riccipts for the first throe months since June, 1 SC;*, show an aggregaU if against fer the same months in tho prccading year—a gain of more than ift per cent. Thu aggregate receipts from Juno CO to NovruiWr :tO, >'.i:.:>r.,471 of the same months in the preceding year. The number of gallons of spirits iu bonded warehouse, produced be fore July 1. was The cumber of gnlloCß produced from July “0, ’><>. to June CO. was ’.’.Tjr.TroiT, shewing that from June 00, Ist’.s, to June IsCH, Iho tax was collected j on 117 gallons, which was - :sj,s7l more gallons than paid tax in 1 m:7. During the eleven months ending June IU), lsf-I'. there were produced and the tax wag collected on ;>7,."7.%75;J gallons of spirits, which, with gallons re maining in bond, shows a total product for the eleven months of 3i,:M9.i::*t gallons, equal to nearly <‘•0,000,000 gallons for tho whole year. This, howover,tho Commission er does not believe includes all the spirits actually distilled. Hitherto, in surveying distilleries, tho average fermenting period was sov luty-mne hours. Under this rule Mil distilleries have been operated, having a Cota! mashing and fer menting capacity of 17*0,1 .*.5 bushels of grain in tweiity.four hours, and a spirt-pnv uv.cing capacity of 47J,<‘.iU*» gallons for the Minjf time. Four hundred and forty-four of these distilleries are now in operation, and the others are temporarily suspended. Having become convinced that seventy nine Lours was too long for a fermenting period, and that frauds were perpetrated, forty-eight hours hours has been fixed as a basis, and. by this re-survey, tho present capacity of s*:l distilleries is n77,“1i gallon* every tweety-four hours. This change will not only increase the revenue, but prevent frauds. Tbo rejieal cf ail deductions on account cf leakage on spirits in bond is regarded r.s a wholesome reform. The Commissioner estimates the annual produc tion of spirits at >i),000 gallons a year, which outfit toptoduc® S•*.;!, 

O<KMH>O of rev enue. He thinks it possible to so exe cute the law as to secure .foO,»)<W,U(K) of lax annually. He advises against any essential change in the law, until Us pro visions have bad a farther practical test. The number of cigars returned for taxa tion in 1 !•»’■*.?, at an average tax of per 1,000, wasin>i,.or.), agaiast ;si7,ii;;,s:»i in 1m;o, when tbo tux was *io jkt 1.000. The Commissioner advises that i»v change be made in the law respecting the tax on tobacco. The roccipU for stamps since March, 1 exceed by nearly a million of d>ll*rs the receipts for the same period of ’ is; vear. Hie Commissioner regrets his inability to recommend any satisfactory plan to prevent fronds and evasions in the use of stamps. The receipts from income tax for the year ending June ">O, Iml'.i. are $2i*,000,000, against for the preceding year. 2Le Cumtut-sioner is of the opinion that, as !<<tp as a large revenue is needed, the in come tax ought to be continued, and as it expires by limitation next year he recom mends that it lie renewed by Congress at the approaching session. lie advises that tho appointments of Su pervisors of the Revenue be vested in the ITewJent, that an increase of si]air be given, and that the office of Revenue De tective be changed to that of Assistant Su pervisor. lie says that where honest and efficient officers have been placed the taxes have I>een promptly assessed and collected. The Commissioner is of the opinion that, es ’.m) j*t cent of the entire receipts was collected front a few object?, all of which may be classed as luxuries or as the accu mulated and associated wealth of the coun try, the Revenue law is not unjust or bur densome ; and he think* that, fairly admin istered, may be collected an nually from spirits, tobacco, fermented liquors, incomes. salaries, sumps, banks, legacies, and g*n companies. He is of the opinion that the Tice metres in distilleries have failed to accomplish tho desired end, but has appointed a commis sion to practically test their sufficiency. The expense of collecting the revenue for tho vent was 177, a reduction of sl,t*;*l,:i:;7 from the expense of the pre ceding year. The number of officers em ployed, leporticg to the bureau, is G,OOJ.

The connected with the revenues of tfic ratiways of the State of Illinois,— which are known to bo carried off to New V« rk l y the officers and Directors of the n>ads, to bo used in private spoculations there,—are beginning to attract the atten tion ol the people, and will doubtless engage tho attention of tho Constitutional Convention, which meets on the 13th of this month. Few persons are aware bow heavily this abuse is now taxing tho business interests of the Slate. Poo pie generally imagine that these railways which troveree tho length and breadth ol fhe State, and on which each passenger train carries several thousand dollars in money received for fares, leave this money in this or some other Western city, where it will find its way into the regular channels of trade again: but this is not the case. The railways which conccntralehercin Chicago, ns well as those which traverse the State in other directions, have been gradually trans ferred to the control of officers and Direo- tora who ore merely Wall street specula ton, —men of large capital—whose chief object in buying block was not to make profits out of dividends, but to get control of tho rovo nuts of the roads, thus placing them id the daily receipt of enormous sums of readv money, to be used in bailing and bearing the stock of tbeir own Dads. All this is ho well understood by bankers that no Western bank cares to have tho account of the most imjrortant railways in tho State, for the reason that, instead of having bal ances to their credit which might be made available to tho business community, the largest railway corporations are often borrowers from such Western banks as ac cept their accounts, while at the same time their average balances in Wall street,—k**pt there for the purposes of manipulating their own stocks and of speculating generally,— may amount to millions. It is known that tho foverolleadingcorporutions whose roads centre In this city have on hand an aggre gate of unappropriated funds amounting to from six to ten millions of dollars, and yet it is not nufriqneutly the case that when these lands are embarked in some groat gambling speculation in New York tho cor porations arc applicants for loans from Western banks to pay their operating ex penses. Tho effect of this drain of funds ffom tho West and accumulation in Wall street is that in the interim between the great speculations there tho rate of interest on call loans drops to 3 or 4 per cent per cent annum, while here at tho West it is the means of making excossivo rates for money, ranging often from l! to 3 per cent per mouth. One of the means by which this almse of the roads is made operative, if not its im mediate instigator, is tha practice of keep ing tho office where tho stock of tho com pany is registered— t, <•,, tho “ transfer office**—m New York. This mokes it pos sible to manipulate tho block, and offers one of the chief inducements to a certain clhss of gambling capitalists to get control of the stock, to control elections of Direct ors and officers, and so have the revenues in their hands for speculative purposes. Whether the Constitutional Convention can require railroads or other corporations to keep their undivided earnings at their principal office or not, it can require them to keeptheir principal office and their trans fer books in the State, and we hope it will do bo. JUDICIAL BEFOEM IN NEW YORK. Tho Constitutional Convention of the State of Kew York, which consumed so much time and cost so much money, n couple of years ago, has not been quite barren of fruit. Although ita work, as a whole, was decisively rejected at tho late general election in that State, a meagre ma jority of about fi,ooo nevertheless sepa rately sanctioned the amended Judiciary article, which was tho chief result of its labors and tbo main object of its assem bling. It is of Interest to those other States that Lave followed New York along tho path of reform to note tho direction and extent of this, her first step backward in her too precipitate course. llie new article, which will form a part of the organic law until ISSO, at least, when another revision may take place, pre sents several improvements upon the sys tem for which it creates a substitute. It converts the fluctuating Court of Appeals into n permanent bench of seven Judgen; enlarges tho judicial force of tho city of New York; forbids the review by any Judge of a decision made by him or by a court of which he formed apart; extends the offl dal term of new Judges to fourteen years; and provides for a choice, at tho general election in 1573, between the present plan of ballottmg for the judiciary and a return to the older and better practice of appoint ment. This last provision ia tho result of a compromise on the part of tho convention l«etwecn the conviction that the elective feature was the precise and grave evil which they were summoned to correct and tho fear that its correction would not bo tole rated by the people, if called upon to give up a part of their power. It will bo im portant for other States to observe whether experience nnd tho united influence of the bar in New York, duriug the next three years, can educate public opinion np to the point of this most necessary surrender. For the question of that vital change in tho source of judicial power transcends the limits of States, and affects the morality of the whole country. To subject Judges to the will of the populace or the command of cliquts is to break down all tho safeguards of society. In criminal judicature espe cially, we may as well hid mutineers name their court-martial, or hog felons to batln their own scaffold, as trust the worst das**!- to choose tho officers who aro set to repress their disorders. In truth, tho nation cannot afford to throw* away any prop to tho stability of thr Jtdiciary, or to lessen in any respect the j»w> of its dignity. A new and giant power » 8 B«tsping the control of modem legisla tion, »od threatens, among oar eager and /eakb-ecking people, to overshadow right and defy justice—-the power of groat cor porations. Tijo records of capitols and of courts alike,tbroughont the land, and most in New kork, dearly show that this treaien dons power, 6U. lu jaliug private greed and energy into orgatijod action, nnchecked by private conscience and feeling, can be met and mastered only b ; public virtue protect ing the public weal though the medium of a permanent, honest, aid independent ju diciary. "WHO

It is con ceded that the reason why American ship* building is mined is that everything which enters into the construction of ships his beensoover-taxed. Tho ordinary remedy for such a state of things is to to remove or reduce the taxation, eo that tho industry may revive, lint the great tariff lobby do not propose to do anything of this kind, cor to emancipate the productive labor of the country. They propose to make pro tection more infamous than ever taking money out of the Treasury, which has once been collected, end handing it over to a privileged class. They propose that when lumber, Iron, canvas, cordage, copper, chains, brass, glass, paints, oils, varnishes, or furniture is imported to bo used in building or fitting a ship, the Treasury Deportment sbwll pay back to tho builder the Ux, averaging perhaps 40 per cent on the whole cost If,.however, be selects American material, then he is to bo paid in money from the Treasury the same bonus. To be more particular, we quote the precise figures: Tfie ccrt of on A 1 iron mUldk ihip, 1/01 tor*, O.

On nil boiler pinto, and other iron for a vessel, the duty in currency averages three cents a pound, or 4 8 per cent in gold. The men at Wash ington who manipulate tax laws to fill their <wn pockets now propose to take from the Treasury of tho United States a sum of money averaging 4Q per cent in gold, and pay it to tho American iron man ufacturers. The ship-builder is to have his choice. If ho imports his materials, he is to l>e paid Lack the tax thereon; if be uses American iron and American wood, he Is to be paid out of the Treasury the same amount of money, to make good the bounty bo is supposed to hare paid tho iron-maker.

The most of them arc the essential materials of which railways are built, cars, locomotives, wagons and carts, and steamboats are constructed. The tax on each of them is a tax levied and col lected on all tho products of tho country which are moved from one point to another. A tax of cine dollars a ton on pig iron Is a tux of three dollars a ton on railway iron.; and this tax, as well as that on the wood, the paints, tho boiler iron and plates, is a tax collected in tho fihapo of increased freights from tho corn, wheat, and flour, Ibo pork, beef, and lard, which are moved from the place of growth to market, and upon the return cloth, iron, implements, fur- uiture, paints ondoils. Tha difference in the price of wheat in Chicago and the place of growth in largely made up of thia tax upon every thing which enters inlo the construc tion of railways, and cars, and steam oats. It is a tax levied upon tho production of the country. Tho robbers at Washington propose to refund this tax to every man who will build a ship. Why not refund it on all articles used in supplying internal transportation? Why should a ship-builder ho exempt from taxes levied upon a car-builder? Why should iron in a ship be exempt from taxation, and not iron in a railroad car or track? Why should tho ship-builder who purchases his lumber have bis taxes paid back to bim, and tbe like favor be refused to tho wan who buys lumber for his fences, his barns, his dwelling house, or his workshop? Why tax the farmer SO per cent on tho canvas cover of his wagon, and allow the canvas sail of a ship to escape taxation altogether? Why tax ouo man and let another go un taxed ? Why should A bo allowed to im port what ho needs free, and compel Hto pay a tax of CO per cent on tho same HrticKs V Is not this robbing the one to enrich the other? Why by law provide that if A can buy his goods CO per cent choiper of B than ho can of C, and will buy of C, ho shall he paid the difference out of money collected by taxation from tbe rest of tho community ? What is this bat a strange illustration of tho rnla of robbing tbo many to enrich the few ? It Is but justice to the sbip-bmlders to Riy that they do not ask relief in this war. In lt>i»o they wore tho ship-builders of the world. But their industry hna been taxed out of existence. They do not 03k to bo pensioned out of tho National Treasury—all they want is to have the prohibitory lax taken off and to bo allowed to compote free ly with foreign builders. To do that, how ever, would bo to release tbo whole indus trial population of the country, not from taxation for the government, hut from the taxation now paid directly to the iron makers of the country. The proposition to subsidize American lines ol steamships, to enable them to com pete with foreign steamers, is but another form of robbery. Take, for instance, tho transportation of moils between the United States and Europe. The linos now running carry the mails for the postages; that Ls, without any cost or charge to tho United States. Why should tho United States, when these mails can bo carried free of cost, take from the revenues on domestic letters $,'.00,000 a year to give to somebody else for canning the mails? There ore whole districts of the United States whore there is no doily mail, or no mail at all, be cause of the inability of tho Post Office Department to pay for tho ser vice ; and yet tho country is to be taxed 000 fur o very ship which Fisk, or Gould, or any other person may build for ocean navigation. If nmnisgocoan steam ers wfl) not pay, why should the people be taxed to moke up the losses? When the wheat crop, or Iho corn crop, or tho fruit crop fails, does the government levy a tax on the country to refund tbo farmers their loss, or to enable them to make money bv their business? How would the iron-mon gets uf Pennsylvania receive a tax for that purpose ? In point of fad, owing to tho excessive tax upon everything which enters into the cost of living, wheat-growing even now .lands in need of subsidy. It has been re- lured almost to the condition of ship luilding. An Ohio farmer gives the fob owing statement (in the Cincinnati (Vvj. turf oil) of tho cost of producing a bushel >f wheat in that State, upon tho overage of twenty bushels to the acre: The tmereet cn |s<> ate per cent ls£.l, nlu-h. nviitfit b> so, gives mnumtu *J" ill (J per ( I'Ut IS C-l, nlllu. 0 (milled »m 20.

If we are to have Imunties to cover business losses, lot us be gin with the fanners, and have agriculture made profitable by donations from tho pub lic treasury. The Chicago Timet thinks that it was the intention of the Legislature th*t the Mayor of Chicago should not hereafter preside over the Common Council. The fact is that the intention of the Legislature can not be ascertained from the bungling and ungrammatical language employed in the section of the charUr amendment which provides for the election a presiding of ficer-, and, if we attempt to go outside of the language of the act. we shah find that the Legislature had no Intention at ail. nor even any knowledge of what they wore passing.

Our goveroment has received information from Minister Sickles that Spain does no* consider a ttate or war prevatiiag between herself and Peru, aud ills understood that the Spanish Minuter here hai l-et-o notified by his government to act ou this undcrfiandtog. The Peruvian Minister vcok a HtuUai ground last winter vtaen he want ed to get out the iron-clad* bought of the United States, and there la no reason now, therciore, why tbose two powers should not come to a tr.endly arrangement about the Spanish gunboats over m New York. There is reason to bcltere that Mr. Kish has suggested as much to ihem, and good reason also for believing that he ba>. In a friendly manner, conveyed a hint to the Peruvian Minister that the method la which be is using bln official position to aid the Canau Junta is baldly proper, ana is not relished oy our gov. ermteLt.

TO TDK ASSOCIATED CHESS, SKCKETAKV BELKNAP ;« REPORT. The report of the Secretary of War Is published ir day.

Two thirds for actual service vonld be ia.Tio men, below which it wooid not be ptudent to go. as me necessities of Hie country and the grm*. extent of termor? to be protected will re quire every man of that number. I recommend mat tDo sniff corps be retained at lb© standard cxed by (beset of July, IS6A, and that the clause prohibiting appointments and promotions be re pealed, in order that vacancies may be filled, a* wsa the practice prior to the passage of the act of March, IS£9.
