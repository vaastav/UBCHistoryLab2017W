A worthy friend of ours, who 13 a loyal demoorat and orthodox Divine, in a noto to us appropriately remarks : I would liko to writo sonio prose for tho Domocrat, but, tho stato of tho public mind demands something connected with Nation al affairs, and I say but little, publicly, on that subject. I have prepared several ar ticles for your columns, and as often, threw them aside, thinking I had better hold still. Yet I do not know, but Preachers should bo permitted to say something to ward tho UESTOivmo.v or the country, since Preachers havo dono so much to de stroy it. Multum in Parvo. If ever tho beautiful phrase, ''words fitly spoken arc as apples of gold in pic tures of silver,' was verified, it was in tho few words which Gen. McClcllan spoko in response to an immouso crowd of people who had gathered around his quarters, and saluted hira with a fine band of music at Trenton, New Jersey. In closing ho said : "And before bidding you good night I Lave this pieeo of advieo to give you : WHILE THE ARMY IS FIGHTING, YOU AS CITIZENS'SEE SUA 1 THE WAR IS PROSECUTED FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE UNION AND THE CONSTITUTION, FOR YOUU NATIONALITY AND YOUlt RIGHTS AS CITIZENS." Let theso words bo impressed on tho minds of all conservative people, and let them act in accordance with tho advice. Letters from Friends. An officer in army of the Potomao, writes us on Thanksgiving Day, and says from present appearances wc aro to havo a regular winter's campaign. Tho peoplo of the North, as I notice by tho papers, demand it. I wish those who are con stantly crying "On to Richmond," before wc aro ready, were here in tho ranks. I thiuk they would soon change their tune, to "On to Winter Quarters." Wo in tend to tako Richmond, but great will bo tho contest, and greater tho victory for our Arms. Tho battle of the War is yet to be fought. I suppose you are dining over Turkey to-day. Well, wo do not find fault with any, fortunate enough to bo in tho neigh borhood of Turkcydom. Our Thanksgiv ing dinner consists of the samo as we get every other meal. Namely, Hard Crack ers, Salt Pork, Deans and Coffee. We enjoy this kind of food very well. I am getting fat on it. Tho Crackers, to judgo by their harduess, must havo been baked for tho Mexican War. If my teeth wero not good and sound, I think I would re-( Eign. Tho cry goes along tho lino to-day, among tho soldiers, of tho Thanksgiving Dinner given by tho Clergy of Washington to the Negroes.

Ono of tho Drafted Militia, from Sugar loaf, in this county, writes us from Harris burg, detailing tho unheard of outrage, that was last week perpetratod upon a fol lowsoldier (from Bedford 00.,) by ono of tho cowardly Guardi. Ho says tho soldier had passed out of Camp, and whon re turning by the samo avenue, and was far in Camp, heard tho order "Halt !' Stopping to look around, was fired at, and shot in tho leg !

"Can we Compete with the West?1' Such is tho caption of tho leading article in tho Decomber number of the Gentssce Farmer. It shows the difficulties which tho farmers of the East labor under in competing with West in tho feeding of cattle, hogs, &c, and offers some sugges tions which aro well worth the consideration of farmers in all sections of the country.

Wo aro in formed that a certain Sensation Preacher, not far from Cattawissa, recently had his delicate sensibilities horrified on reading a brief paragraph, headed "Bloody Pulpit," copied from the Ohio Crisis, into the iTColumbia Democrat."

Thoy wero arrested on watrant signed by the Secretary of War but in whioh uo chargo was set forth. During tho whole term of their imprison ment thoy vainly endeavored to learn of what they wero accusedbut not only did tho Assistant Judgo Advoeato General, tho Assistant Secretary of War and Secretary Stanton himself deny their vory reasonable request, but actually desired them to mako statements in their own vindication without a knowlcdgo of thoir alleged offence. Furthermore, their counsel were not per mitted to sco tho papers in their case and tho accusations against them if such doc uments existed. They wero twioo taken boforo tho Judgo Advoeato for hearing, but remanded without any light thrown upon tho causo of their mysterious incar ceration, or being heard in their owu de fence. Whcn,atlength,they wero dischar ged 'honorably,' as tho certificates, signed by some subordinate officer read, thoy wero required not only to take tho oath of alle giance, but also to swear dial Viey would not institute or cause to be imtitutcd any suits against any authorities 0 the United States or of any loyal State, for thicr im prtsonmenl. The fact that some parties in tho West had brought suits for false imprisonment delayed their dischargo for some timo, as tho Judgo Advocate said nothing could bo dono until tho Secretary .of War was consulted. Tho result ofthe consultation was, apparently, tho incorpo ration of tho above now clauso in tho oath. When asked to sign this document some of the prisoners grow very indfignaut and refused to tako such an oath, but as some were in failing health, and did not know how long thoy might bo kept in duranco, Gnally, by advice of their counsel, complied and wero released but are yet ignorant of tho charges upon whioh thoy wero ar rested, if any there woro. Their treatment in prison was not bad, they wero obliged to furnish their-owu provisions and wore not permitted to hold private converse with thoso visiting them an officer always being present. Their correspondence was watched and it was only by strategcra that they could communicate with their frionds at home, as their letters were, after being read, desti'oycd, returned or confiscated. Ono ofthe guards was imprisoned for al lowing tho prisoners somo trifling liberty. Tho lives of the prisonors were constantly endangered by the carelessness of the guard in tho barracks below, several balls having como up into tho prisoners' apartment, discharged from mutkets below.

Hon. Thos. fj. Florence. Wo aro exceedingly gratified at tho ma ny kind illusions of a largo numbor of our exchanges, to our ablo and talented asso ciate, Hon. Thomas B.

Mr. Florence has had ten years exporienco as a member of the House, and with rare clerical talent a good voice, and a thorough acquaintance with parliamentary rules, would mako a most capable and efficient officer. Wc may Bay, without egotism, that few men havo proved themselves more worthy tho confi deuce of tho National Democraoy. In season and out of season, as a reprcsenta tivo in Congress as a journalist, Mr. Flor ence has been zealous and untiring in up ho'ding tho great principles which must over bo tho guide of the Democracy of tho country, and his election as tho executive officer of tho new Houso of Representa tives would be a compliment ho li s emi nently merited.
