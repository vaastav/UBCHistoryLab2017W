" Alter reviewing the tiuuucial Aspect of the Government, showing the constant increase of the surplus revenue and pointing out some objectionable projx*. bilious for its redaction, the President tnys: "I have deemed it my duty thus to bring to the knowledge of my country men, us well as to the attention of their representatives, the r> sponsibility of 1 giidative relief for the gravity of the timncil situation. The failure of Con gress heretofore to provide against tl.? dangers which, it is quite evident, the very nature of the dilBculty must neces sarily produce, caused fiu inci.il distress ntid upprt heiis'uti since their last ad j ?urumebt, which Used to the utmost nil the nutborityjAinl expedients witliiu the ixecutivo control; mil these appear now to be exhausted.

The President proposes as a measure of relief from the unnecessary nnd rap idly increasing surplus, a revision of llie tariff liws. Ou this subject he ?ays: "It needs h.-.rdly to be (dated that wbili the present situation ?l ?inaiids iv remedy we' can nnj * lii saved from a predicament in t!ie futu.e by Ihe removal of the cause. Our selietsa of taxation, by means of which the needless sui| l is is taken from the people and put iuto the public treasury, consists of a tr.rifl" or duty levied upon importations from abroad. nn?l internal revenue tuxes levi ed npou the consumption of tobacco uud spirituous liquors.

That id precise!/ what Prc&iJent Cleveland prt'i'jwii.

There will be no chance of eva.tiou; the surjil is will be reduced or it will uot. and the party that shirk.i its duty is lost. As a general thing, remarks the San Francisca Call, the public are sick of th<- defence of insanity. They have seen il to often u-ed by s'k ll.'ul practitioners to defeat the ends of justice that they think it is high time to set limits to its srojie. Iu one point of view every murderer is a madman. The impulse of Cam was itsilf an aberration of intel- { h et. Hut the law, iu its wise concern for society ut l'.rge, cannot afford to i outer into a nice analysis of the mind of u criminal, an I to excuse his criiuc be cause il appears to have been instigated by n temporary loss of mental equi poise. If it did there would be no such thing as the punishment of crime, and society woul I revert to those fitst prin ciples for which the Anarchists sigh. It c in only absolve the homicide when his insanity is to manifest as to be notori ous aud obvious t > all beholder*. It is not eiio'igh that this or that doctor, with kindly purposes, should give his professional opinion that lie was uot iu his right mind . Such evidence its that has no place iu a murder trial. Somu people do lots of thing < every d iy which justify the b< lief that they are tempor arily out of their miud. liilt It wil| never do to grant thorn n license to ?.o nmit murder on that account. r? n tussnoritsi I'liotiitn. i.truN.
