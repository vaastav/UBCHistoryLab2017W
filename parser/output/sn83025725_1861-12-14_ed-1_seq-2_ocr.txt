"It.irnot a great State paper," says that journal. "As for its style, enough is said when we etraerre that Mr. Lincoln certainly wrote It himself." Which means that tbe Message Is decidedly Llncoln lan. Giving Mr. Lincoln tbe credit ot being "honest," the Commercial adds, "It is clear that he brings to the aid of thecountry. no such thing as first rate executive ability" and tbat tLere are not wantieir evidences of that singular combination of straixbv for ward, indifferent obstinacy and almost tim -orous indecision which marks his character." Upon the "very point concerning which a distinctly pronounced policy is demanded by the popular will and the national emergency, be is most obscure." Neitoer does tbe Com merdal like the style ia which the foreign re lations of the United States ate discussed. It wanted something of a "more elevated tone." It is not particularly struck wih tbe recom mendation for tbe construction of a railroad to Eiet Tennessee, but regards It as 'curi ous;" nevertheless, it believes a railroad in that direction ''would be a good thing," and, if it were actually constructed, ''Cincinnati would be willing to celebrate, as usual in such cases," and, we presume, would not ob ject to entertaining a brace or more of legis latures. ' But, the Commercial, with something of tbe satirical in its tone, suggests that "there is already a road between Louisville and Nashville," and asks, "would it not be well to open it before building another!" That question was very well put in. We should like to bear "Old Abe V response to it. If the thousands of men he has on tbe line of that road cannot open it, there is lit tle probability that he will ever get men enough together to construct one Jo East Tennessee. - ; The policy of the President with respect to colonizing the free negroes, is upset with a side blow-, though tbe Comn-reiat does think it would be "poeiic j iethe" to South Caroll na,"if her sacred soil thoold become peopled by liberated slaves." After rta'Jng the re mark.' of the Message respecting the negro question, the Ccmmtrcial says :" This is all righ , si frr as It goes, tut it does not go far -nougb; and tbf doh intelli gent people of tbe c u itiy will probably be ot be opinion tbat in the Prtsideui'a anxiety not to be hasty, he b bten too low. ' A df rect recommendation t a Q m but prudent policy to be pursued towards tbe slaves of rebel?, where our vrmiis prevail over the insurgents, w uld have been limtly, and re ceiving the weight due the conceded modera tion and patrioiim of tbe Executive, would have been useful in temperio tbe radicalism that will ba delayed la -Congress as we 11 as in relieving our military leaders rl embar- raiments tbat ate constantly becoming more perplexing, and which must' led to tbe gravest complications. In brief, tbe Prtei dent Lbs evaded tbe rugged issue, and leaves the everiasiiug slavery question still adrift in the terrible rapids cf ibe Hvil War, with tbe roar of a political Niagara nigh. Tbe omi s'.on to discuss the domestic con trovrsy" outcf wbicb tbe war has sprung, and tbe quaiat Lincoloian phraseology with' which he takes leave of tbat subject, are Charming. . Again, the Commercial 'says : . The review of tbe progress of the war is not felicitous, and some of the statements made are not distinguished fir ex-ict accord ance with the facts. - Tbe information tbat "Missouri is comparatively quiet" , will be news to tbe unhappy, .eople of that State. We find in this portion of the Message teti moay tbat Cvnoborates tbe assurance we some time ago bd from good authority, tbat the President is too busy in discharging the duties of his office to read Ibe newspapers. Few readers will suppress a smile at tbe sort of reference tbat is made to tne retirement of General Scott end the appointment of Gen. McClellan as general-in cbief of tbe st ray. Tbe p'ofound paragraph, in which we are treated to a discussion of tbe proposition tbat "one bad general is be ter than two good ones" is especially entertaining. Tbe inten tion probably was to make , very discreet notice of the evilswhich bed been endured when Gens. Scott and McClellan were both in com mand, but it would be cruelty as well as in consistent with tbe remark about "two good generals," to draw ' the interence that the President congratulates himself upon having only "one bad general" in McClellan. .In fact, Seward ought to have revised tbat pan graph. "' , From tbe above, it is apparent that the Commercial does not entertain an exalted opin. ion of either Mr. Lincoln or his Message. Southern Chivalry ' Soon after tbe disastrous federal defeat at Leesburg, tbe Yankee press in tbe interest of the late Col. Baker, commenced a war upon tbe federal commander, Gen. Stone, ebariag him with making a sacrifice of Biker and his men wantonly. The Assistant Adjutant of Gen. Beauregard, Col. Thomas Jordan, with the consent of the general, ' tiansmitted to Gen. Stone under a flag of truce, copies of his orders wtich bad been taken on the field of battle, and which, would afford Gen Stone the means of defending himself successfully against the assaults of Biker's 'friends..

V . 1 The Richmond Examintr of the 9th, learns from a private letter received in that city from General Loring's command, that an aU tack was daily expected to be made 'by es on the enemy on Cheat Mouataln. The con dition of the Yankee troops occupying Cheat Mountain is deicribed as one of the greatest destitution and suffering. A dispatch from Washington to St. Louis, on the 5th, says: Hon. Charles J, Faulkner, of Virginia, wilt be released frox custody on parol. He will proceed immediately South and procure a similar release of Hon. Alfed Ely. If unsuccessful, he pledges himself to return to custody in thirty days, f&The New York Tribunt severely "cuts up" Gen. Sherman's proclamation to the people of South Carolina. It shows tbat he most carelessly conceded tbe mischievous doctrine of "State sovereignty," and in fact placed himself and bis troops in the attitude of enforcing the national sovereignty over a State.wbich, by his own careless admission, has a right to oppose them as invaders ot her territory. The Tiibunt also regards tbe whole proclamation as wordy and in bad taste, and hopes that the worthy general will fight bet, te than he writes. So belt. St. Low Dem. Looeiko to the Wkbt Tbe Richmond Examiner of the 9th says : We are persuaded that, in official circles, tbe leading anxiety is, for tbe present, dt verted from the Potomac to the significant and eeriens progress of events in the West. The campaigns in Western Virginia, Eastern Kentucky and Missouri are recognized by the enemy as well nigh over. Thirty-two of their regiments tbat bave been engaged at Elkwater, and on tbe Kanawha and Big San dy and it Missouri, are known to bave been transfernd to Central and Western Kentucky. It is also reported in Northern accounts tbat twenty other regiments from the Northwest ern State camps are to be sent across tbe Ohio. This will bring up the enemy 'srmy in Kentucky to 120.000 men. That tbe ene dt will hasten an engagement; there is thought tr. be xouch more probable than that they will risk very soon a general action on any of tbe fields of tbe Potomac. ; The Vote in the House of Uepre- , - sedatives on the Crittenden IXes- olntion .

The writer pretends to be exceedingly well posted in respect to the movements of Gen Johnston and the number and situation of the militia and Confederate troops at Nashville. He also informs ua as to the feeling ef the Union men at r.ouisville regarding Old Abe's slavery policy as indicated in. his mes sage, and ot this he no doubt speaks cor rectly:. .LiOUISVILLB, lXC. O. To tht Editor of tht Enquirer : The arrival and departure of troops has made quite a stir in this city during the past few days. Regiment after regiment is daily arriving, and after temporary en campment in the suburbs of the city, are removed further into the interior, toward Bowling Green. ' At Lebanon, Columbia, New Haven, Camp Nevin, and other points, our troops are concentrating in large num bers. The Second and Ninth Ohio move to day; the Twenty-third Ohio and several In diana . regiments leave to-morrow. For want of transportation, the Ei hteenth Regiment (Regulars) did not get away yes terday, and have remained on board the Telegraph, x esterday afternui the regi ment, in full dresa, paraded the principal streets of the city, and elicited much ap plause. This afternoon the regiment will go through dresB parade on the Levee, and in the morning will leave for Lebanon. The Thirteenth Ohio Regiment are at Jef ferson ville. This was the regiment that ar rived here on the Izetta, instead of the Tenth, Col. Lytle. ' This regiment is wonderfully behind time, and their delay is eliciting much disapprobation at head-quarters. The Ninth Regiment are nearly all in ranks, but the Sixth lacks two hundred of being up to the regimental number. These latter bave only two more days to return before being pursued as deserters. Gen. BuelTs Body Guard, from Pennsylvania, are expected here this evening. The present encampment near Louisville is a disgrace to the army. - The ground se lected is low,' marshy, and the mud knee deep. In this slush the , troops sleep, eat and march, and already a large proportion of them are in the hospitals, confined by sickness. From all the information I can learn I fear the army will have a rough and disagreeable time in passing through Ken tucky: The roads are in a bad condition, and but lit;l progress can be , made in a day's march. T - Bwacg Green it is about scTerty-five mile b t the different circuits laid out f ribn vri(U divisions to move will m-ke tre d. .stHi.ce loih -t place between one hundred aid one Lunlred and fifty miles. Although, the Confederates bave fortified their present position at Bowling Green there id intelligence iu the city to day that they will fall back toward Nash ville, where 30,000 of the State militia of the middle and western divisions of Ten nessee, per order of Governor Harris, are concentrating. At Nashville the work of erecting redoubt and fortifications has been commenced, the largest fort being on the race track. v The camp of the State militia is on the Fair Ground, and the ground selected for Johnson andBuckner's forces is on the oth er side. The Confederate forces already number 75.OC0 men, and is being daily aug mented in numbers, so that by Christmas they will present an army of over 

1CO.O0O men. They are continually advised of the strength and condition of our forces, and are uneasy in their present location, believ ing that if they remain. General Buell will surround and successfully capture them. There are those in the Confederate army and Southern Rights men of this. city who are opposed to any retrograde movement from Bowling Green, entertaining a firm belief that the Confederate army can gain a conquest over the Federal troops and push their way to Louisville. The Federal offi cers are equally confident, so that a despe rate struggle will ensue before either ac knowledge defeat. - Those of the State militia ot Tennessee who decline volunteering are pressed into the service, and the drafting system is re sorted to in filling up vacancies occasioned by sickness or inability. A party of them who were determined not to fight against the Union,' left Nashville on Sunday night, and succeeded in reaching this city last evening. They present a lamentable ap pearance, and from them valuable informa tion has been obtained. They deny, how ever, that the -Union citizens of Tennessee are robbed, abused, &c, on account of their Union sentiments, provided they remain quiet. There have been instances in which tbe advocates and adherents of the Union have been required to enter the Confederate service or leave the State, but the number is small. At Nashville, and throughout the State, the cry of hard times is on every body's tongue. Provisions are gradually increasing in price, -and are enormously high: : -The poorer class are suffering great ly, and unless some immediate remedy from starvation is obtained, they will be compel led to enlist to eain a livelihood. The meet ing of the Confederte Congress at Nashville is contradicted by the Naehville papers. t The Provost Marshal last night ordered all the bars and saloons to be closed after dark to prevent soldiers from obtaining liquor. In the majority of instances the front aoors were closed, but admittance . was obtained through a back or side door. : The Memphis Avalanche, of a recent date, states that the Confederate gunboat Tcsca rora, on ber way up the Mississippi river from New Orleans, was burned to the water's edge, fifteen miles below Helena. A strong wind was blowing at the time, and it was found impossible to save the boat. ' Efforts were made to prevent the explosion of the magazine, . but the shells on board com menced to explode,, and in a few minutes after the fire commenced. Their explosion fired the negro quarterters on Mr. Harbutt's plantation, as well as the tops of the trees on the bank of the - river.. The- boat .was burned to a-wreck. -.- -.-' . 3 - -; - The President's Message was discussed in the Journal of this morning in t column and a half editorial. The Journal con. de mns the course of the Executive in his al lusions to the slavery question. The article meets with the approval of all classes here,' and unless Cosgreis puroues a different y ol ioy than thaVurgedly the Abolitionists a wonderfal change will take place in this and all other States.- Several leading military gentlemen, vhote namet leanfurnith if ntctt- tary, have openly prodatmrd that they mill retign at enct if tht 'tlavery utut u to have anything to do vith thie var. As I have al ready written you, there is the intensest feeling in the army and among the Union element here upon this subject, and it is difficult new to foresee the consequences to the Union cause if Congress fails te rebuke the abolition fanatics immediately. The War in the West Ah Abolition ..-' " View.-' ' We take the following from a letter pub lished iu the Cincinnati Commercial, dated Cairo, Nov. 29 : Tbe most reliable news from Columbus, Ky.. confirm the reports tbat Polk and Pillow are receiving large reinforcements ot rebel troops from below, and that their strength must not be underrated. At least 28 000 trcopa are at that point, and tbe daily accessions of artil lery irom Memphis are large. It is plain to see that the rebel department of tbe Mississippi now intend to make Colam bus tbe firei great fort of the Mississippi. It Is by nature very strongly fortified, and, iu fact, a far stronger point than any other place on the river between Caiio and Vicks- bnrg. - The rebels also have two great advantages. They bave below Columbus the navigation of the Mississippi to tbe Balize, also of a com plete railroad connection to Memphis, with tine rolling stock, on which to transport epsedily tbe heavy artillery and munitions cf war from Memphis and other points in Tennessee. Columbus cannot be taken with a less force than 50,000 men to attack in the rear, with the full Western flotilla in front, at present. Iu a month hence it will probably take double tbat number. Tbe forward movements of Price ia Mis souri indicate clearly their strategy, the same which so far baa been so successfully carried out. That strategy is to keep the army of the Mississippi, or at least tbe main portion of it, actively employed in Missouri, running after Price and his subordinate generals. This prevents them from descending the Mississippi and carrying the war into Africa, at the same time giving to the rebels of Ten nessee, Arkansas, Mississippi and Louisiana that all important military advantage, time. They want time to fortify, to cast cannon, to raise money, to concentrate their forces, and also to discipline them, all of which they are gaining by these diversions of Gen. Price. It may be safely said that Gen. Price has done far more for tbe southwestern rebel cause than all their other generals combined. This view is fully corroborated by tke rebel press of Memphis and Vicksburg. The importance, benca, of an early and very heavy movement southward, .by tbe Mississippi, cannot be over-estimated by the Administration. When we take into consid eration and calculation, tbe immense prepon derance of the wealth and commerce of tbe Southwestern States bordering cn tbe Miasis ?!ppi river, as csmparrd with thatot the sea coat slave btates nd ta -ir internal impor tance to the Unin. it must be conceded thnt tbeir reduction to loyalty would conduce far more quickly to the restoration of tbe Union lhao tbat cf the sea coast States. The great West demands the speedy open ing of tbe Mississippi river, it the federal Government is able to do it, and she is able, if a proper - dlstrib'J .ion of the forces is made. Let politicians, say what they please, the Mississippi river and its uncontrolled naviga tion to the Balize, is the great key to tbe prosperity of the whole country, and It must be opened.- A Valuable Prize Captured off the South Carolina Coast. The Niw York Tribune says : The prize schooner Albion, of Nassau, New Providence, formerly tbe Lucy R. War ing, of Baltimore, arrived at New York 00 Sunday. Sbe is ludeu with arms, ammuni tion, salt, fruit, provisions, oils, tin, copper, saddles, bridles and cavalry equipments, and is valued at $100,000 ' She was captur ed a few days since by the United States Bteamer Penguin, while attempting to no the blockade off South Carolina. At six o'clock on the morning of the 25th of November the cf2cer of the watch on board the Penguin obterved a sail bearing southeast and distant about seven miles, heading in for Edit to island, South Carolina; the wind at that time was west southwest and blowing very lresb. Tbe schooner had her lower sails set. Tbe steamer's anchor was weighed immediately and steam put on to overhaul her. As soon as this was per ceived, tbe schooner bore away before the wind, wbert a gun was fired to bring ber to; tbe frhot fell short and no notice was taken of it. Tbe main gaff topsails were set and every endeavor made by those on board the schooner to get clear off. -. ! At 8 o'clock another gun was fired, tbe shot falliog close alongside, upon which more sail was made on board the schooner. In fifteen minutes another gun was fired, and the shot fell clcsa under her stern. The British ensign was now hoisted on board the schooner, which still continued to make all sail. Another shot was fired, which caused her to heave to, after a most exciting chase, which bad listed three hours. When the Penguin came alongside and hailed her, tbe captain reported her to be tbe schooner Alli son, of Nassau, N. P., from Nassau, and bound to New York, loaded with salt and iruit... When boarded she was found to be also loaded with saddles, bridles, boots shoes, leather, thread,; and. various other articles.
