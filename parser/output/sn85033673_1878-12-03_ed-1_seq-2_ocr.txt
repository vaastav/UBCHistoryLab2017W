We will give a resume of the more important points.' The first subject touched upon after tho introduction is the yellow fever. The interesting statement is , made that about one hundred thousand cases are believed to have occurred, of which about 20,000, according to intelligent estimates, proved fatal. The pecuni ary loss to the oountry is only to be reckoned bv the hundred million of dollars'! ' JMiteen hundred tentaand rations to the value of $"25,000 were sent to the cities and towns which ap plied for them. ; The President con cludes on this subject by saying: Tho frnrful spread of this epidemic has awakened a very general public senti ment in furor of niitmnal sanitary admin istration, which shall not only control ouaruntine. lut have tha sanitary siitwr- vision of internal commerce in time of epidemics, and hold an advisory relation to the State and municipal health author ities, with power to deal with whatever endangers tho public health, and which tho municipal- and iStnte authnritie are unable to reflate.. .The national quaran tine act annroved April ', 1878. which was passed too late in the last session of congre.- to provide the means for carrying it into practical operation during the past season, is a step in the direction here in dicated. In view of the necessity for the most effective measures, by (junrantine and otherwise, for the protection of our seaiiort and the country generally for this and other epidemic., it u recommended that congress give to the whole subject early nnd careful consideration. The state of afiairs jxditical and the receut, congressional, elections in the South next leceive attention. This section of the message will he read with the greatest interest everywhere, as it is supposed to have some bearing on the next Presidential election. It will, perhaps, disappoint wmie of the more rabid and stalwart Republicans, yet can be' made - to do ! service by partisan , Idlers and ' papers. - The President surnes that manufactured or greatly exaggerated reports coming through party channels are facta. In this he reveals the lingering prejudices and partisan feeling of tho politician. If the laws have been violated in any parfof the, country the" offenders should be punished, lut a President goes out of tha way when he bases a message or a part of it upon a mere rumor which, originated with defeated candidates or mendacious politicians. Mr." Hays says, in Tcferring to South ern elections: ' The friends of law and order looked for ward to tlio conduct of these elections a offering to the general judgment of the country an important opportunity to measure the degree in which the rights of suffrage could be eseni-eil by the colored neople, and would be respected by their icllow-citi.ens; but a more general enjoy me.'it of freedom of suffrage by the colored peopiO, and a more just and generous protection of that freedom by the commu nities of' which they form a part, were generally unticipated than the record of the elections discloses. In some of those States in which tho colored people have been unable to rurilu? their opinions felt in tho elections, the result is mainly due to influcncci not easily measured or reme died by legal protection; but in the Htntes of Louisiana mid South Carolina at large, and in some particular congressional di- trict outside nf those. fStutes, the record!. of the election seem to compel th Couchl sioii that the rights of the colored voters have been overridden, and their nartieiim1 tion in the elections not permitted to be either general or tree. It will be for tho congress for which these elections were held to make such ex animations into their condui t is mav be appropriate to determine the validity of the Claims i iih-iimi, vo uieir scan, in tho meanwhile it become tba duty of the executive and judicial department) of tho government, each, in its province, to in miiro into and punish violations of tho laws of tho United States, which have occurred. I call but repeat what 1 snid in this connection in my last inossiige, that whatever authority rests with mo to this end 1 shall not hesitate to put forth, and I am unwilling to forego a renewed appeal to the legislatures, the courts, the execu tive authorities and the people of the .States where these wrongs havo been per petrated, to give their assistance toward bringing to justice the offenders and pre venting a repetition of the crimes. Xo .means within my power will be spared to obtain a full and fair inveatigatioa of the alleged crimes, and to secure the convic tion and just punishment of the guilty. J respectfully urge upon your attention that the congressional elections, in cvory district, jiv a very important sense, are justlv a .matter of political intereit and concern throughout tho whole country. Kadi State, every political party, is en titled to the share of power which is con ferred bv (he legal and constitutional suG-j-, It is tha right of every citizen, poking the .nial.llcalions pr-r tod by fiiw tocit-tone iiiiintuiudatod ballot, and to have his ballot honestly counted. So I,.ng as the exercL-e f 'his power and the viyoymentof thin right aro common and equal, practically a well as formally, sub mission to the results of the suffrage will be accorded loyally and cheerfully, and all the departments of government will fivl the true vigor of the popular will thus exprosed. No temjHirary or ad ministrative interests of government, how ever urgent or weighty, will ever displace tho seal of our people in defense of the primary righta of citizenship. They understand that the protection of liberty reouvrea tha maintenance, in full vigor, of the many methods of free speech, free press, and free suffrage, and will sus tain the full authority of government to enforce the laws which are framed to pre serve these inestimable rights. The ma terial nrocress and welfare of the States depend on the protection afforded to their citizen.... There can bene peace without such protection, no prosperity without peace, and the whole couutry i deeply interested in the growth and prosperity of all its parts,. "V hue the country has not vet reached complete unity of feeling and reciprocal confidence between the communities so lately and bo seriously estranged, I feel an absolute assurance that the tendencies are in that direction, and with increased force. The power o public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional or State attachments, in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizens of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. It the President could see both sides of tlie question he might at least have called attention to the fact that in most of tho Southern States a per fect understanding and the utmost harmony prevail between tho white and colored people. In Mississippi, for instance, there are congressional districts overwhelmingly colored, where no violence or disturbance whatever was reported, and yet Demo crats were returned to congress. Gen eral Chalmers, one of the re-elected, was not even in his district during the canvass, being sick in Louisville, Ky. The President lends himself to party uses when ho seeks to make political capital out of two or three alleged election disturbances, and yet passes in silence over the indisputable fact that the great body of the people in the South aro at peace--are on good terms with each other, and as the gen eral rule, law-abiding, and quietly pursuing the ordinary avocations of life. In reading over the other portions of the message nothing of special sig nificance or importance strikes the mind. The following allusion is made to tho Mexican question in a very com mendable spirit: Since the resumption of diplomatic rer httioiis with Mexico, corresjKindence has been opened and still continues between the two governments upon tne various questions which at one time seemed to en danger their relations. While no lonna agreement has been reached as to the troubles on the border, much has been done to repress and diminish them. The ptlective force ot Lnitea Mates troops on the ltio Grande, by a strict and faithful compliance with instructions, has done much to romove tho sources of dispute. and it is now understood that a like force lit Mexican troota on the other side of the river is also making an energetic move ment against the marauding Indian tribe. This government looks with the greatest satisfaction tion every evidence of strength in the national authority of Mex ico, and upon every effort put forth to prevent or to punish incursions upon our territory. Keluctant to assume any action or attitude in the control of these incursions, by military movements across the border, not imperatively de manded for the protection of the lives and property of our own citizens, 1 shall take tne earliest opportunity, consistent wun the nroner disclmrsre of this plain dutv. to recognize the ability of the" Mexican gov ernment to restrain effectively violation. of our tcrritoiy. It is proposed to hold next year an international exhibition in Mexico, and it is believed that the display of the agricultural and manufacturing products of the two nations will tend to better understanding and increased com mercial intercourse between their people.

New Yerk Graphic All is over, but there remain some things yet to be said respecting the success of our American exhibitors at this latest and, all things considered, the most interesting ot our interna tional exhibitions. The disinterested and self-sacrificing spirit displayed by some ot our Amer cn citizens in connection with the Paris Kx position is worthy of high praise. The legislature of the State of Jennessee, at. its last session, failed to vote an appropriation for the pur pose of making au exhibit at Pans of the agricultural and mineral wealth of the Stite, although tho cost of such an exhibit would have been repaid a hundred fold by the increased impetus which it would givo immigration to the State. Mr. J. 15. Killebrcw, the State commissioner ot the bureau agriculture, statistics and mines, re solved that the fttato should not be deprived of the advantages whicl; might be derived from such an exposi tion, and he himselt undertook the tat-k. Tho result is that the State o: Tennessee figures hero in the mow creditable manner.

A Npmiish Obituary. One of the Spanish provincial na per publishes a singular notice in its obituary. It ayg : " This morning our Savior summoned awav the iewel- cr, Siebald Illinaea, from hi (fhnp to another and a better world. Toe un dersigned, his vidow, will weep over his tomb, as will also his two daugh tcrs, Hilda and Kmma, the former whom is married, and the latter is open to an offer. 1'he funeral will taka placo to-morrow. His disconso late widow, Vcronique Illmaa. P. S. This bereavement will not interrupt our business, which will bo cariicd on as usual, only our place of business will be removed from 3 Tessi des Tcin turiors to i Rue de "issiouaire, as our grasping landlord has raised our rent." Several days ago the Pcblic Ledof.r published & long account of Mollie Pancher of Brooklyi, who " hasn't eaten anything for nearly fourteen years." The New York Sun haa held an interview with Dr. Hammond in relation to Mollie, and thus reports that distinguished gentleman : . . Dr. William A. llammond sat in an immense and ancient chair in his library when the Sun reporter called upon him. "I have read the Brticle on Miss Fancher," ho said; "read it all through carefully." ""Well, .what do you think of it doctor?" "What do I think of it? Why, that it is a perfect humbug a clear case of deception, sir." " But, doctor, there is the testi mony of such men as tho llev. Dr. Durvan. the Rev. Dr. Van Dyek, Prof. West, Henry Parkhurst, the astrono mer, and such physicians as Drs. Speir, Ormiston, Kissam and Mit chell." " I don't mean to say that the writer of that article has not been told all that he has written, or that the gen tlemen named are not honest in their opinions. lJut 1 know that they are all deceived lied to by this hysterical girl." . . , isut just see what tests she was subjected to. How can thero be any deception " Well, there is deception in it all, said the doctor, vigorously. It's all a humbug. W hv, my dear lellow. she isn't the first girl that has deceived earned and good men. There are plenty ot cases ot simulated hysterics. and Miss 1 ancher s I case is one. l haven't seen her, never heard of her betore : but I have heard of so many other simular cases that I do not hesi tate to speak strongly about it." I ho worst case ol tins kind, con tinued the doctor, " is that of Sarah Jacob, who was known as tho ' Welsh Pasting uirl. She was born on May 12, 1S57. Her parents were ignorant. In her early years she was healthy and intelligent, given to religious reading, and, it is said, composed poetry. Sho was a very pretty child. In February, 1S07, she complained of pain in the pit of her stomach, and afterward had spasms of a clearly hysterical charac ter. She suffered much from fits and spasms, and the quantity of food she ate gradually diminished. On the 10th of October it was solemnly de clared that she had ceased to take any food whatever. Then she began to attract attention The parents insisted that sho ate nothing, that food was loathsome to her. The vicar was skeptical, and for months argued with the girl and her parents. te line them that he knew there was deception. They strenuously denied it, and at length the vicar himself gave in. He believed in the lasting, and published a letter that he knew that she ' had not taken a single grain of any kind of food whatever during sixteen months, lie invited medical men to sxaniine into her case. Ihe suggestion of the vicar was acted upon by the neighbors. I hey appointed a committee, which watohod fourteen days and the committee reported that wasagenuino case, no deception, owever, the reports of this case show that tho watch was a very care- ess one, the parents having access to the child at all times. Then Dr. Fowler, a noted physician, looked into the case and examined the girl care fully. Ue found her a pretty, plump child, with ro?y checks and lips and sparkling eyea. He found by his ex amination that her condition was such to show the impossibility of her being the subject of an exhaustive iscase, or even ol her having been in bed continuously for nearly two years. as her parents asserted. Dr. Fowler's conclusion, an published in the Lon don limes, was that it was simply a case ol simulative hysteria in a young girl having the propensity to deceive very strongly developed, and that with it was associated, notably, the power or habit ot prolonged tasting. ell. continued the doctor, the case created so much excitemeut that corps of trained nurses, from Guy's Hospital. Jjondon, were sent to watch arah. Her parents sanctioned the proceedings, and the watch began on the Uth of December. Gradually symptoms of mental and physical dis turbance appeared, rive days later she was looking pale and anxious : her eves were sunken, her nose pinched lhe vicar told her parents that Sarah was failing, and suggested sending the nurses away and giving her a chance to obtain food. They refused ; said they had seen her quite as weak be fore, and that she would not eat whether the nurses were there or not Repeatedly were they begged to with draw the nurses, and again and again they refused, saying there was no oc casion. Darati became weaker and weaker, and on the 17th of December died actually starved to death. 1 cs, sir, starved to death. Thccase created much excitement. An inquest was held. The coroner said thero could be no doubt that the responsibility rested with tho father, who knowingly and designedly failed to cause his child to take lood. 1 he jury deliberated fifteen minutes and returned a verdict that Sarah Jacob died of starvation caused by the neglect of the father to make tho child take food. Then the govern ment took tho matter up, Jacob and his wife were arrested and also the medical men who had superintended tho watching. No case was made out against the latter. The former were tried for manslaughter; tho lather was sentenced to twelve- months' hard labor and the mother to six months. "Now, hero was a oaito," continued the doctor, "tho like of which lias never boon seen. lt bIiows plainly how all tho facta which scicneo has gathered go for naught, cvon with ed ucated persons, when brought face to face with tho false assertions of a hys terical girl and two ignorant and do ceitf'ul peasants. If wo know any one thing, it is this, that thero can bo no Ibrcc without tho metamorphosis qf matter or some kind. 1 ot burn was a girl maintaining her weight, actually growing, ner animal neat Kept at its duo standard, her mind active, her heart beating, hr lungs respiring, her skn oxhailnK, end. al this, ns many people supposed, without the ingestion of Uio material by which alone such things could be. Why, it is ridiculous, preposterous. Upon my word, if that girl over in Brooklyn should die in aoyofthosa experiments made with her, I'd have every one, concerned n the matter indicted for manslaughter. I would, indoed." "Two years ago," the doctor added, "I wrote about this thing in a book on Spiritualism and nervous derange ment, in which I spoke as 1 have spoken to you. In addition, I said this (the doctorgot the book andread): "Such is the tendency of the aver age human niiud to be deceived that it would be perfectly possible to re enact in the city of New York the whole tragedy of Sarah Jacb, should ever a hysterical girl take it in ner head to do so, and there would not be want ing even tfrom among those who might read this history, individuals who would credit auy monstrous declara tions she might make." "That sounds like prophecy, don't it?" said tho doctor, smiling. "But how do you account for her secsnd sight ; her reading a paper that sho don't see ; her telling the contents of a sealed envelop?" "She can't do it." said tho doctor, vehemently. "She can do nothing of the kind. I'll bet $3000 she can't do it before mo. I will write a check for over $1000, and if she will tell me the exact amount, the bank on which it is drawn, and describe the check gener ally. I'll give it to her. Why, 1 can read you case after case where these hysterical girls have deceived thou sands. Take tho matter of visions. This girl in Brooklyn is a Protestant, so sho confines her visions to seeing heaven and her dead freiends. Were sho a Catholic she'd see the Virgin Mary or the Savior, like that girl at Ijourdes. who sees the Virgin, and who actually has been the means of having a church built on rthe spot where the visions appear. You have seen accounts of the excitement she has created. Why. she is simply a cataleptic. I have myself had under my immediate charge fifty girls and women who in the condition of ec stasy have had visions of all sorts all the way from God himselt down to tho schoolmistress who had locked them ud in dark closetd. I tell you that those people in Brooklyn are of two classes those who lie and those who are deceived. Mind you, 1 do not sav that Miss Fancher is to blame, that she does all this intentionally. Hysteria prompts deception. It is a characteristic of the disease. She has probably not will enough to overcome the desire to deceive. But she would be aided in every way to overcome the desire, not assisted in her deceptions. For all this is simply the deception of a hysterical girl. "But she has deceived clergymen and physicians," "Oh, that's nothing. Clergymen are the most gullible men in the weld, and physicians who have not made a study of nervous diseases are apt to be imposed upon by these girls."
