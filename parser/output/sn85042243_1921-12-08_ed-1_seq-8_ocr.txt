PAGE EIGHT SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER" RATES FARES,WANTED "With Further Adjustment of Operating Costs Harmonizing With Prevailing Tendencies" Washington, Dec. 8.—Hope is ex­ pressed by the interstate commerce commission in its annual report today to Congress that a "substantially low­ er" level of railroad rates aiid fdres would be possible with an exception in the volume of traffic following the present business depression and "with a further adjustment of operating costs in harmony with prevailing tenden­ cies." Freight rates, following war time increases and some later readjust­ ments, have not yet reached an equil­ ibrium, the commission says, because the chief factors controlling them, "the value of service and the cost of transportation still are in, a state of flux." The commission's report is for the year ended ty^t October 31. It dis­ closes that a total of $430,000 000 has been ordered paid to the railroads un­ der the government guarantee against losses during the first six months aft­ er their return to private ownership and that there is still due an estimated $105,000,000 on this account. Out of 677 carriers entitled to guarantee pay­ ments, the commission says, 547 have filed claims, totaling $818,000,000 but payments of only $536,000,000 have been held justified by the commission's am'it. No statement was made with respect to the difference between the roads' own summary of their losses during the six months and the gov­ ernment's findings. The roads which have not yet liled claims for losses, the repcrt adds, are short lines and the total will be "relatively small."

INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE IS TO BE CONSTRUCTED: Will Connect Detroit and Wind' sor—Will Weigh Around 107,000 Tons Detroit, Mich., Dec 8.—Plans for the new international suspension bridge to. connect Detroit and Wind­ sor, just announced, show that it will have the longest single span in the world, measuring 1,802 feet, or 24 inches longer than the great canti­ lever at Quebec. Of double-deck con­ struction the new link between Caa^ ada and the United States will accom­ modate street car, automobile and pe­ destrian traffic on the upper deck and passenger and freight train service on the lower dcck. Barring unforeseen delays, actual construction work will commence next spring, and within four years the upper deck will be ready for service. Without interfering with traffic on the highway deck, it is planned then to begin construction of the lower deck, which should be finished in two years more. The bridge and its approaches will have a total weight of 107,0(|0 .tons, with eight cables carrying the huge span. Six of these cables will be. 21 inches in diameter and two will be 18 inches thick together they will sup­ port a pull of 146,000,000 pounds.<p></p>DISTRICTCODRT GRINDING AWAY Has Heavy Criminal Calendar To Dispose Of District court, in session here under the direction of Judge J.

HARDING ASKS AIR BUREAU Transmits Message to Congress 1 Advising Regulation Washington, De?. 8 President Harding transmitted to congress the annual report of the national advis­ ory committee for aeronautics with the recommendation that a bureau for the regulation and development of air navigation be established in the de­ partment of commerce as proposed by the committee. "I tihink there can be no doubt," the president stated in a message which accompanied the report, "that the devlopment of aviation will be cdmetof, (^re.at importance for the pur­ pose ot commerce as well as national defense. While the- material progress in aircraft has been remarkable, the use has, not as yet been extensively developed in America. This has been due, in the main, to lack of wise and necessary legislation. Aviation is destined to make great strides and I believe tha£ America,' its birthplace, can jjind should be foremost in its de­ velopment." Th§ report which supplemented one made" last-April to the president, rec recommended continuation of the air mail serv).:e and'development of avia­ tion fpr military dnd naval purposes. 

LEPROSY CASE IS UP AGAIN Dispute Arises Over Who Is To Care For Survivors While there is conflict between the state board of health and Kidder county as to who shall pay for the care of surviving relatives of Mrs. Catherine Houst, the Kidder county leper victim, J. E. Burton, deputy sheriff, is holding' the sack, according to him. Burton came to the- state capitol with Charles Seagrin, states attorney of Kidder county. An appropriation of $4,500 was made by the last leg­ islature for the care of lepers and families, according to Seagrin. Mrs. Houst died in the fall and 'Burton has been locking after her mother and daughter, neither of whom have shown signs of having contracted leprosy but who have been closely observed. In November the state board of health notified Burton, he said, that the board would cease making payments from the state funds. State's Attorney Sea­ grin maintains that the state and not Kidder county should care for them. The matter has not been settled, but Burton says he had no.t been re­ imbursed for money paid out in the last three months for their care.
