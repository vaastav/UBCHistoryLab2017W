FOREIGN RELATIONS. We remain iu peace and friendship with foreign powers. The efforts of disloyal citizens of the United States to involve us in foreign wars, to aid an inexcusable insurrection, have been un availing. Her Britanic Majesty's Government, as was justly expected, hav exercised their authority to pre vent the departure of new hostile ex peditions from British ports. The Emperor of France has, by a like pro ceeding, promptly indicated the neu trality which he proclaimed at the be ginning of the contest. Questions of great intricacy ana importance have arisen out of the blockade and other I u if i , , ... be lorprpnt nnpr.qtinns hpfivppn this Government and several of the mari time powers, but they have been dis cussed, and, so far as u as possible, ac comodated in a spirit of frankness, jus tice, and mutual good will. It is espe cially gratifying that our prize courts, by the impartiality of their adjudication, have commanded the respect and confi dence of maritime powers. THE SLAVE TRADE. The supplemental treaty between the United States and Great Britain for the suppression of the African slave trade, made on the 1 7th day of February last, has been duly ratified and carried into execution. It is be lieved that so far as American ports and American citizens are concerned, that inhuman and barbarous traffic has been brought to an end. TERRITORIAL CLAIMS. I shall submit for the consideration of the Senate, the convention for the adjustment of possessory claims in Washington Territory, arising out of the treaty of the loth of June, 1847 between the United States and Great Britain, and which have been the source of some disquiet among the citi zens of that now rapidly improving pai t of the. conn try. Spain's maritime jurisdiction. A novel and important question, involving the extent of the maritime jurisdiction, of Spain in the waters which surrounded the island of Cuba, has been debated without reaching an agreement, and it is proposed, in an amicable spirit, to refer it to the arbi trament of a friendly power. A con vention for that purpose will be sub mitted to the Senate : THE SCHELDT DUES. I have thought it proper-subject to the approval of the Senate, to concur with tho interested commercial powers in an arrangement for the liquidation of the Scheldt dues, upon the priciples which have been heretofore adopted in regard to the imposts upon navigation, in the waters of Denmark. foreign claims. The long peuding controversy be tween this Government and that of Chili, touching the seizure at Silina, in Pern, by Chilian officers, of a large 8mount in treasure, belonging to citi zens of the United States, has been brought to a close by the award of His Majesty, the King of the Belgians," to whose arbitration the question was refered by the parties. The subject was thoroughly and patiently exam ined by that justly respected magistrate. Although the sum awarded to the clai mants may not have been as large as they expected, there is no reason to distrust the wisdom of his Majesty's decision. That decision was promptly complied with by Chili, when intelli gence in regard to it reached that country. The joint commission, under lastses sion, for carrying into effect the con vention with Peru, on the subject of claims, has been organized at Lima and is engaged in the business en trusted to it. Difficulties concerning inter-ooanic transit through Nicaragua are in course of amicable adjustment. In conformity with principles set forth in my last Annual Message, I have received a representative from the United States of Columbia, and have credited a Minister to that Republic. BIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS IN THE UNITED STATES. Incidents occurring in the progress of our civil war have forced upon my attention the uncertain state of tbe in ' tarnation al question touching tbe rights of foreigners in this country and of United States citizens abroad. In re gard to some Governments, their rights are at least partially defined by treaties. In no instances however, is it expressly stipulated that on tbe in stance of civil war, a foreigner, resi ding in this country within the lines of the insurgents, is to be exempted from the rule which classes him as a bellig erent in whose behalf the Government of bis country cannot express any privileges or immunities distinct from that character. I regret to say, bow ever, that such claims have been put forward, and in some instances in be half of foreigners who have lived in the United States the greater part of their lives. There is reason to believe that many persons, born in foreign countries, wbo have declared their in tentions to become citizens, or who have been fully naturalized, have eva ded the military duty required of them by denying the fact, and thereby throw ing upon tho Government tbe burden of proof. It has been found difficult, or impracticable, to obtain this proof, from the want of guides to the proper sources of information. These might bo supplied by requiring the clerks of courts where declarations of intention may be made, or naturalization effec ted, to st'nd, periodically, lists of the names of persons naturalized or declar ing their intention to become citizens, to the Secretary of the Interior, iu whose department these names must be arranged and printed for general information. There is also reason to believe that foreigners frequently be come citizens ot the United states for the sole purpose of evading the duties imposed by the l.iws of their native country, to which, on be coming naturalized here, tliey at once repair, and though never return ing to the United States, they still claim the interposition of the Govern ment as citizens. Many altercations and great prejudices have heretofore (grown out of this abuse. It is there fore submitted to your serious consid eration. It mioht bo advisable to fix a limit beyond which no citizens of the United States, residing abroad, may claim the interposition of this Govern ment. The right of suffrage has often been assumed and exercised by aliens, under pretense of naturalization, which! they have disavowed when drafted into the militarv service. I submit the ex pediency of such an amendment of the laws as will make the fact of voting an estoppel against any plea of exemption from military service or other civil ob ligation, on the ground of alienage. JAPAN. In common with other Western Powers, our relations with Japan have been brought into serious jeopardy through the pervese opposition of the hereditary aristocracy of the empire to the enlightened and liberal policy of the Tycoon, designed to bring the country into the society of nations. It is to be hoped, although not with en tire confidence, that these difficulties may be peacefully overcome. I ask your attention to the Minister reading there, for the damages he sustained in the destruction by fire of the residence of the Legation at Yeddo. THE INTERNATIONAL TELEGRAPH. Satisfactory arrangements have been made with the Emperor of Russia, which, it is believed, will result in ef fecting a continuous line of telegraph through that empire, from our Pacific coast. I recommend to your favorable con sideration the subject of an interna tional telegraph across the Atlantic Ocean, and also of a telegraph between this Capital and the national forts along the Atlantic seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. Some connections, established with any reasonable outlay, would Jje economical as well as effective aids to the diplomatic, military, and naval service. OUR REPRESENTATIVES ABROAD. The consular evstem of the United States, under the enactments of the ait Congress, begins to be self-sustaining, and there is reason to hope that it may become entirely so with the increase of trade which will ensue whenever peace is restored. Our ministers abroad have been faithful in defending American rights, aud in protecting our commercial in terests. Our cpnsuls have necessarily had to encounter increased labors aud responsibilities, growing out of the war. These they have for the most part met and discharged with zeal and efficiency. This ackowledgraent justly includes those consuls who residing in Morocco, Egypt, China and other central counties, arc charged with the complications and extraordinary powers. THE NEW TERRITORIES. The condition of the several organ ized Territories is generally satisfacto ry, although the Indian disturbances in New Mexico have not been entirely suppressed. The mineral resources of Colorado, Nevada, Idahoe, New Mex ico and Arizona are proving far richer than heretofore understood. I lay be fore you a communication on this sub ject from the Government of New Mexico. EMIGRATION. I again submit to your consideration the expediency of establishing a sys tem for the encouragement of emigra tion. Although this source of national wealth is again flowing with greater freedom than for several years before the insurrection occurred, there is still at great deficiency of laborers in every field of industry, epecially in agricul ture and all our mines, as well of iron and coal as of precious metals. While the demand for labor is thus increas ing here, tens of thousands of persons destitute of remunerative occupation are thronging our foreign Consulates, and offering to emigrate to the United States, if essential, but very cheap, as sistance can be afforded them. It is eay to see that under the sharp disci pline of civil war, the nation is begin ing a new life. This noble effort de mands the aid, and ought to receive the attention and support of the Gov ernment. Injuries, unforseen by the Government, and unintended, may, in some cases, have been inflicted upon tho subjects or citizens of foreign counties, both at sea and on the land, and by persons in the ervices of the United States. As this Government expects redress from other powers when similar injuries are inflicted by persons in their service, on citi zens of the United Slates, we must be prepared to do justice to foreigners. If the existing judical tribunals are in adequate to this purpose, a special court may be authorized, with power to hear and decide such claims, of the character refered to, as may have arisen under treaties aud public law. Conventions for adjusting claims by joint commission have been proposed to some governments, but no definite answer to the proposition has yet been received from any. During the course of the session, I shall probably have occasion to request yon to provide in demnification to claimants, where de crees of restitution have been reudered and damages awarded by the admiralty court, and in other cases where this Government may be acknowledged to be liable in principle, and where the amount of that liability has been ascer tained by an informal arbitrary. THE INCOME OF FOREIGN CONSULS. The proper officers of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by the laws of the United States upon the subject, to demand a tax upon the in comes of foreign Consuls in this coun try. While such a demand may not be in violation of public law, or per haps of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign coun try, the expediency of so far modify ing tbe act as to exempt from tax tbe income of such Consuls as are not citizens ot the United States, derived from the emolument of their office, or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the ground that a courtesy, which ought to be reciproca ted, exempts our Consuls in all other countries from taxations to the extent that is indicated. The United Stales. I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and com merce. THE TREASURY. The operations of the Tresnry during the last year have been successfully conducted. The enactment by Con gress of a national banking law has ! proved a valuable support of tbe pub lic credit, aud the general legislation in relation to loans has fully answered tbe expectations of its favors. Some amendments maybe required to perfect existing laws, but no change in their principles or general scope is believed to be needed. Since these measures have been in operation all demands on the Treasury, including pay of the army and navy, have been promptly paid and fully satisfied. No considerable body of troops, it is believed, were ever more amply provided and more liber ally and punctually paid, and it may be added that by no people were the bur dens incident to a great war ever more cheerfully borne. The receipts during the year from all sources, including loans aud balance iu the treasury at its comencement, were 1901,125,674,86. The aggregate dis bursraents were $895,796,630,65,-leaving a balance on the 7lh of July, 1863, Of $5,829,004.21. Of the receipts there were derived from customs, $69,059,642.40; from internal revenue, $37,640,787.95; from direct taxes, $1,485,103.61; from lands, $167,617,17; from miscellaneous sources $3,046,615.35; from loans, $776,682, 361.56 making the aggregate, $901, 125.674.86. Of disbursements, there were-$232,-539.22 for pensions, etc., $4,216,526.59 for interest on the public debt, $24,729, 15.846. for War Department $599,298, 700,83, for the Navy Department $63, ill, 105. 27, for payment of the funded and temporary dept $181,986,635,07 making an aggragate of $895,760,630. 65. and leaving a balance of $5,329, 044.22; but the payment of the funded and temporary dept, having been made from money s borrowed during the year, must be regarded as merely moneys nominal payments, and the borrowed to make them as mere ly nominal receipts, and that the amount of $181,086,635,07 should therefore be deducted both from the receipts and disburemenl. This be ing done, there remains as actual re ceipts $714,709,995,58 leaving the balance as already staled. The actual receipts and disburse ment for the past quarter, and the esti mated receipts and disbursements for the remaining three quarters of the ennent fiscal year of 1864, will be shown in detail by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which I invite your attention. It is sufficient to say here that it is not believed that the actual results will exhibit a state of the finances less favorable to the country than the estimates of that offi cer, heretofore submitted : while it is confidently expected that at the close of the year, both disbursements and debts will be found very considerable less than has been anticipated. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR. The report of the Secretary of War is a doc ument of great interest. It con sists of, first, the military operations of the year, detailed in the report of the General in-Chief ; socond, the organi zation of colored persons into the war service ; third, the question of the ex change of prisoners, fully set forth in the letter of Gen. Hitchcock; fonrth, operations under the act for enrolling and calling out the national forces, de tailed in the report of the Provost Mar shal General; fifth, the organization of the Invalid Corps; and, sixth, the ope ration of the several departments of the Quartermaster General, Commissa ry General, Paymaster General, Chief of Engineers, Chief of Ordnance, and Surgeon General. It has appeared impossible to make a valuable summary of this report, ex cept such as would be too extended for this place, and hence I content myseh with referring your attention to the re port itself. -a i , ni us n : ' . i i' 1 tnr.ty '.ft', THE NAVY. The duties devolving ou the naval branch of the service during the year and throughout the whde of this on happy contest, have been discharged with fidelity and eminent success. The extensive blockade has been constantly increasing in efficiency as the Navy has expanded. Yet, on so long a line, it has so far been impossible to entirely suppress illicit trade. From the re turns received at the Navy Department, it appears that more than 1,000 vessels have been captured since the blockade was instituted, and that the value of the prizes already sent in for adjudica tion amount to over thirteen million dollars. The naval forces of the United States consists at ibis time of 558 vessels, completed and in the course of com pletion ; and of these seventy-five are iron-clad armored steamers. The events of the war gave an in creased interest and importance to the navy, which will probably extend be yond the war itself. The armored vessels in the navy, completed and in service, or wnicn are under contract and approaching com pletion, are believed to exceed in num ber those of any other power; but, while these may be relied npon for harbor defense and sea coast service, other, of greater strength and capacity, will bo necessary for cruising purpose, and to maintain our rightful position on the ocean. The change that has taken place in uavy warfare since the introduction of steam as a motive power of ships-of-war, demands either a corresponding change in some of our existing nay yards, or the establishment of new ones for the construction and necessary re pairs of modern war-vessels. No in considerable embarrassment, delay, and publicinjury have been experienced from the want of such Government establiwhments. The necessity of snch a navy yard, so furnished, at some st able place upon the Atlantic seaboard, has, on repeated occasions, been brought to the attention of Congreng by the Navy Department, and is again presented in the report of tb Secreta ry, which ccompanies this acommui cation. c fLu lititn-1 :. o ft lan I think it my duty to invite yc special attention to this subject, at hIso to that of establishing a yard and depot for naval purpose upon one o4 the western rivers. A naval force has been created on these interior Waters, and under many diaad vantages, within little more than two years, exceeding in numbers the whole naval force of the country at the commencement of the present Administration. Satisfactory and important as has been the performances of the heroic meff of the navy at this interesting period, they are scarcely more won derful than the service of our. mechan ics and artisans in the production of war vessels, which has created a nevj from of naval power. Qur country hat advantages superior to any other na tion in her resource of iron and timber, with inexhaustable quantities of fuel in the immediate vicinity of both, and in close proximity to navigable waters, Without the advantage of public wotks, the resources of the nation have been devloped in the construction of a navy of snch magnitude, which has, at the very period of its creation, rendered signal service to the Uoioa, The increase of the number of seamen in tbe public service from 7iQ00 men' in the spring of 1861, to about 24,0001 at the present time, has been accom plished without especial legislation and extraordinary bounties to promote tha increase. It has been found, however, that the operation of the draft, with the high bounties paid for army recruits, la beginning to affect injuriously the naval service, and will, if not correctsd, be likely to impair the efficiency, by detaching seaman from their proper vocations, and inducing them to ente the army. I therefore respectfully sug gest that Congress might aid both. the army and naval service by ade quate provision on this subject, wb: h would, at the same time, be equitable to the community more especial inter; ested. I recommend to your consideration the suggestion of the Secretary of In Navy in regard to the policy of foster ing and training seamen for the naval service. The Naval Academy is ren-t di ring signal service in preparing Mi -shipmen for the highly responsible da ties which in attei lile they will be re quired to perform, in order that tho country should not be deprived of edu cated officers, for which legal prov ions has been made. At the naval school the vacs caused by the neglect or omiwsu make nominations from States in "i; IKltB -jV i i-aitf- .-.Jl.T ' rection have been filled by the St. i tary of the Navy. The school is now more full and complete than , at any previous period, and in every respect entitled to the favorable consideration of Congn s. THE
