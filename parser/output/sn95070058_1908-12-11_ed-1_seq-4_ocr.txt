Francis Joseph ascended the throne of Austria Hungary sixty years ago and la still doing business at the old bland. San Francisco Is still ' furnishing sensations. The chief of police has suicided Just to keep up the city's reputation. And now a Chicago professor says that kissing Is to ho relegated to the lower classes In the future. Pity the poor rich man ! The man who gives the world a square deal generally gets pain In kind while the one who docs not , soon er or later gets the worst of It. With uncertain eggs retailing at three cents apiece and the hens on their midwinter strike , the outlook for Christmas cake Is a gloomy one. It cost $1,200,000 to carry on the campaign which elected Mr. Taft. It was quite a sum of money but then the people have got an extra large presi dent. A trade dollar bearing the date 1884 , recently sold for $284. Less than half a dozen were struck off that year hence their unusual value. Rockefeller and Archbold are earn ing their $1.50 per day by relating re miniscences some of which are prov ing well worth the"money to the pee ple. An excellent plan lias been proposed In New York to establish farm colonies for habitual tramps and vagrants. Labor will be compulsory , but not cruel or monotonous. The forestry commission Is begging that the people who wish to help along the preservation of what forests re main , hang up their stockings this year and spare the young spruces. James , T. Hill predicts a steady Im provement In business conditions for the next few years but no boom. Those who have experienced booms hope the eagaclous railroad president Is right. Charles Brodio Patterson , special student of longevity , says It Is pos sible for a man to live forever. With out taking Issue on that point wilh the learned specialist , we would like to Inquire if he can run for the presi dency as long as that ? If it takes two terms in the presi dential chair to fit a man who had done no small amount of literary work before , to become an editor , what an amount of natural genius most men who get there without this distinguish ing training must have. Dr. Mltchonikoff is strenuously ex perimenting on a dope to prevent the ravages of old age the elixir of youth which has been earnestly sought for by each succeeding generation. If the doctor survives his own treatment the world may then take some stock In It. Mr. Archbold has explained very fully and kindly that the Standard Oil company put Its competitors out of business for their own good. Isn't It strange how slow these men have been to appreciate the disinterested beneficence of this great corporation ? Every business man In Norfolk will feel more comfortable with the lire Inspection , which has just been un dertaken , finished. An ounce of pre vention Is .vorth a pound of cure and such prevention as this ought to place Norfolk In hotter condition than ever before to resist the slings and arrows of outrageous names. It begins to look like Holt county Democrats have been laboring In vain for Democratic majorities in this county the past dozen years. Of the many and varied applicants for a state job under the Democratic governor - ernor no announcement has appeared yet of a Holt county man annexing n elate salary. O'Neill Frontier. . How about Art Mullen ? Northern Nebraska and southern South Dakota have every reason to make this one of the most Joyful Christmas seasons yet experienced. Crops have been good , prices for the products of this region are high and prosperity Is general. This section has money In the bank and there's reason for a merry holiday season. very best Hellers on record , The pro ceeds of the sclo go to charity , which with the fact that the author Is Queen , accounts for the great demand for tlir work.

Mr. Achhold says that the Standard Oil company put Its competitors out of business for their own good. Strange that some mi'ii haven't heard yet that the theory of "Tho dlvlno rl' ht of kings" was exploded a long , long time ago. Mrs. Frank Gould "shuns publicity" In her divorce case. In this Mrs. Gould has tl-e company of a vast number of "undesirable citizens" of all classes , When people do that which will not bear the light of day they always avoid publicity. With the acreage of winter wheat considerably lessened , and the condi tion averaging not high , there are prospects that all of the farmers of northern Nebraska and southern South Dakota who have planted winter wheat will make a good profit next summer. And now some old pessimist Is tryIng - Ing to establish the Idea that Paul Uovero and his famous ride were merely creatures of the Imagination. If he had been with Paul on that mem orable night , he would have been con duced that he was a lively myth. That "midnight ride of Paul Revere" will remain a fixed star In United States history long after these prying investi gators are dead and gone. The suggestion is made that every ox-president be retired as commander- In-chief of the army and navy. This Is a position which he occupies dur ing his official career. It Is not active , unless war should occur , but would carry with It an ample salary and a dignified position. Whatever is done should he with a view of maintaining the dignity of the presidential office and the Independence of the individual. To try to dodge the issue la out of the question. Socialism bns got to be faced In America as II ba.s been In England. So far as ( I teeks to per vade society , < / ( / ) a nunno of univer sal brotherho/iiS / , l/ii / ; spirit of social ism meets a fiiiM cy and almost uni versal response. But to Its method of accomplishing this the abolition of Industry based upon profits as the reward of service , there can be no such general response. The Pacific peace pact between Japan and the United States which agrees upon free and peaceful com mercial development in ihe Pacific , is a very sensible agreement. There Is no earthly reason why there should be war between the United States and Japan or any other country and the signing of this agreement , even if it ! s informal , will go a long way toward settling war as a possible issue Into the remote background. The recent mine disaster at Marrl- ana , Pa. , in which every man in the mine was killed , impresses the coun try once more with terrible emphasis that In some way these men who work In the depths of the earth ought to be protected from such cruel deaths. Instead of less lives being lost each year than the preceding one , the death rate seems to be on the Increase. Cannot American scientists and inven tors do something to save the unfor tunate miners ? England and Russia have recently come to an agreement concerning Per sla which gives Russia the northern third as her sphere of Influence , while British Influence Is to be supreme In the southeastern fourth. The shah Is as changeable as the weather vane. One day he promises his people a constitutional government and the next day he decides to remain "king ol kings. " as he styles himself. Prob ably England and Russia will eventu ally administer Persia much as France and England did Egypt before the Arab's rebellion. Lord Roberts , England's greatesl soldier , frankly expresses the feai that when the psychological moment arrives , Germany may accomplish what Napoleon failed to do success fully Invade British domain. Voi Moltko , Germany's greatest tactician once remarked that he know twentj ways of landing an army into England but not one of getting it out. Thai condition still remains true. Lore : Roberts' warning may stir up more military activity , but it will not alarn : the Britons who have depended or their great navy over since It repulsed the Spanish Armada and became mis tress of the sea. The administration has decided upor a further extension of the civil ser vice reform. The fourth class post masters of the more populous scctlor of the country extending north of the Ohio and east of the Mississippi wll ! be affected by the new ruling. The present system lays upon the congress men of each district the responsibility at Ions for those who wish to qualify , the aim Is to Insure the employment of only such persons as are qualified to give the government good service. The plan has not yet been tested but as It has worked satisfactorily In other departments It Is probable that It will In this. A wealthy New York woman , who conceals her name , has recently built In New York a handsome five story lire proof hotel at a cost of $150,000. It Is known as the Harlem Boys ho tel , and Is designed to meet the needs of hoys without natural protectors. It Isn't a free hoarding house , although the youthful patrons do get more for their money than they could think of gettlni ; elsewhere. Board , lodging , washing , Ironing and baths for $1.05 nor week how does that strike yon ? It Is a novel benevolence , but wisely administered has wonderful possibili ties for the uplifting of these home less hoys , and what class of unfortun ates needs a helping hand more than the homeless boy ? That portion of Texas lying west of the Pecos river and between New Mexico and the Rio Grande Is shut off from the rest of the Lone Star state by mountain ranges and arid plateaus , Feeling their Isolation the people ol this portion of the state which conv prises an area somewhat larger than Pennsylvania are seeking admittance Into the union as a separate state All that Is necessary to accomplish , their desire Is to gain the consent ol the whole people of Texas. This , how ever , they are not likely to do as the Texans are inordinately proud of the dimensions of their great state which rivals France In size. If France car support a population of 45,000,000 , the Texans think their state can do as well. Within a generation the state expects to cast more electoral votes than New York does now. If Texas desires to retain her territory , sin must endeavor to keep her out lyliif territory pacified and In touch with the rest of the state. Since the state capitol Is as far from the leading cltj of the Trans-Pecos country , as Minne apolls is from St. Louis , this Is noi such a simple task as It sounds. 

JUDGE SULLIVAN'S RESIGNATION The secret behind the reslgnatioi of Judge Sullivan from the supreme court of Nebraska two days after h < had been appointed to the place bj Governor Sheldon , is generally agroec to have been the probable fact tha the Democrats have determined tt contest the legality of all four o : Governor Sheldon's appointments. The program as It has been urgei by W. H. Thompson and others is for the legislature to Ignore the canvass made by the state canvassing board and the proclamation and subsequent appointments by the governor , but to proceed to make the canvass Itself on the ground that until the canvass is made by the legislature nobody knows whether the amendments creating two new Judges was carried. Then after declaring the result Governor Shallenberger will Issue his proclama tion and make his appointments. It Is pointed out , however , that If Sheldon has any doubts about the ap pointments he lias just made being legal , he can still circumvent the Dem- ocratlc plan , since the newly elected governor cannot make act until af ter the legislature has canvassed the vote , and In the Interim between that announcement and the Inaugu ration he could re-enact what he has done rei-vntly. Governor Sheldon , however proposes to stand by his actlop. uf Monday , believing it to bo THE WORLD'S INTERVIEW. the action of the New York World ( u making the amende honorable to the German emperor for publishing a fictitious Interview , purporting to be the same as that which was to have appeared , ln the Century magazine shows what conscientious responsl- hlllty rests with the press of the country In general , and how very care fully a newspaper must constantly been on its guard lest it be "stung. " The Century magazine was to have printed an Interview with the kaiser When it became evident to the German - man ruler that publication of the in terview would cause trouble he re quested the Century to supress it This was done at the expense of get ting out an entirely new edition ol the magazine , destroying the original Naturally every New York newspapei was hard after a hint as to what the interview contained. One night the World got a story that seemed to be authentic. It was sent to the mar who wrote the original magazine interview torview and ho read the proofs ; with out making any comment on the proofs , other than to correct them , he gave the World every reason to be Hove that the story was authentic The story came at a very late hour when the owner and editor of the paper were asleep. It was published and later proved to bo Without founda tlon. The World thereupon cabled the kaiser , apologizing for its mistake , and printed an editorial In which It ex pressed Its regrets in the matter. This required moral courage. And this Incident , compared with the ac bo an authentic Interview , but never offered any sort of an apology when the falsity of their story was proved. THE PRESIDENT'S ENCOUNTER. Two newspaper men have Just been added to the Annaiilas club by Presi dent Roosevelt. Dclavan Smith , pub lisher of the Indianapolis News , and William M. Luffun of the New Yoik Sun , are the latest persons to. Incur the chief executive's wrath. Both are referred to In terms even more burn ing than the "undesirable citizen" phase. "Abominable slander and falsehood , " "lies , " and "mendacity for hire" are some of the choicer expres sions. The prcBldent wrote his letter to William Dudley Foulke of Indiana. Mr. Foulke is the same man to whom the president wrote some time ago declaring that federal patronage was not being used to further the Taft campaign. Foulke had written the president enclosing - closing a clipping from the Indiana- polls News as follows : The campaign Is over and the people ple will have to vote tomorrow with out any official knowledge concerning the Panama canal deal. It has been charged that the United States bough ! from American citizens for $40,000,000 property that cost those citizens enl > $12,000,000. Mr. Taft was sccretarj of war at the time the negotiation was closed. There Is no doubt the government paid $40,000,000 for the property. Bui who got the money ? Wo are not tr know. The administration and Mr Taft do not think it right that the pee pie should know. The president's brother-in-law is Involved in the scandal , but he ha < 5 nothing to say The candidate's brother has beei charged with being a member of the syndicate. He has , It Is true , denlei It. But he refuses to appeal to the evidence , all of which is In the pos session of the administration am wholly Inaccessible to outsiders. For weeks this scandal has been be fore the people. The records are In Washington and they arc public records. But the people arc not te see them till after election , If then The president denies the charges ol graft and then flays the two editors for things that their papers said. The two editors briefly replied , Laffan tie cllnlng to enter Into a controvers > with the president because he said Roosevelt had too light regard foi truth in a controversy. Smith said the trouble with Roosevelt was thai that paper declined to burn incense under the nostrils of a man greedy foi Incense fumes. The language used by the presidenl is pretty strong. It seems regrettable that ho should have thought sucl : words essential to maintain his stand ing among the people of this country As a general proposition the Amerl can people hold the view that the dignity of the presidency should be maintained at highest possible level and that bitter personal encounters between the president and private citizens , in which the president takes the aggressive and resorts to bitter epithets , should come only as an ex treme measure. A president can hardly take the time to fly Into a rage and enter the public prints every time his adminstration is criticised. If the criticism be untrue , It will die of Its own weight and the papers In question in this instance were hardly entitled to the compliment of so much attention from the White House. The people of the country would have taken no stock In the charge of graft In the Panama purchase , even without these attacks. The middle west did not even realize that these charges were being made until the president brought the matter to their attention. The public has too much faith in Roosevelt's integrity to make such personal attacks from the White House at all necessary in refuting these charges. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. President Roosevelt's ' message , de livered to the new session of the Six tieth congress at noon Tuesday , will be read with Interest over the entire nation , as the Roosevelt messages al ways are. The president points out at the be ginning the fact that the nation Is prosperous a fact which ougnt to mean much to all citizens. In regard to railroad control , he reiterates his view a view which has logic to back It that the federal gov ernment must control all transporta tion lines , both Interstate and Intrastate - state , If control anr regulation are to bo effective , . The president has deemed it wise at this time to call down those dema gogues who are seeking to ride Into public favor ( and public olllce ) by the mere act of attempting to discredit and destroy all forms of business. The demagogue , ho says , Is a dangerous foe to society. The president does not accept the socialistic theory that the government should own the tools of production , but ho sees the advantage of having machinery , etc. , owned as much aa possible by the worker. In the case | of farmers this merely means that the I farmer should own his own land , this 1 being a moro desirable condition than that In which the land Is owned by absentee landlords. 1 The postal savings bank , favored In the Republican national platform , and ilonnrv theory of a iroved by the government , bo argues. The point is a good one that cor- lorato finances should be BO super- vlsc'd by the government that the or- Unary citizen may Intelligently and safely Invest his money In corporate stocks. As it Is at present the aver- ivo man Is fearful of putting his sav ings into certain Industrial stocks and lionds which ought to bo perfectly safe and the- value of which should bo known to every reader In the land. If this wore the condition , corporatloiiM would not experience the dlllleulty In getting cash which they mimelines ! meet. More1 stringent legislation along the employers' liability line Is urged. A good word In the matter of salary Is put In for employees of the govern ment. Half holidays during the sum mer should bo granted to government employees , ho says. Defense of the courts Is made and higher salaries are asked. The salaries paid our judiciary are all too meager. A rap is taken at Samuel Gompers. Forest preservation is deservedly given attention. Navigated rivers us well as those that are navigable , are spoken for. Action on Inland waterways at this session Is urged. Parcels post IB urged , along with Postmaster General Meyer's theory , and the president makes an at tempt to convince the country store keeper that his Interestas well as those of the farmer , will be best served by the establishment of a limited parcels post. Those opposed to this will argue that this would bo but the entering wedge. The public health is a matter worthy of attention , In the president's view. The immediate admission of Now Mexico and Arizona as states Is urged , Progress on the Panama canal Is entirely satisfactory , the president says. says.Real Real progress Is being made toward self government in the Philippines , the message says. Japan treated the fleet well and re ceives special recognition for the wel come In this message. A new system of promotion in the army is urged as advisable. Probably one of the most important features of the message Is that part in which the president urges a re vision of the anti-trust laws so as to permit the formation of those combin ations which would work for the pub lic benefit. All in all the message is more con structive and less passionate than those sent by the president yast year , At the same time it rings witli the same Roosevelt force that character ized all of those.
