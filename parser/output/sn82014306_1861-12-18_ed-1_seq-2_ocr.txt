Tbe meet intelligent correspondents of the PM reaU If .t W BkihfwSe, reprint the Pres ieent's views as being decide, and his position n the question of the proper wsj to conduct the war 3 axed and unalterable. We have, on the aotbontv of a correspondent, wnhic to a New York journal, the statement that "The President is resolutely determined to veto any scheme what ever, involving the emancipation o. negroes, in such a manner that they are turned loose upon the Southern States on an equality with the white occupiers of the soil. He, on Saturday evening, uttered the following words: mancipation would be equivalent to a John Brown raid, on a gigantic scale. Our position is surrounded with a sufficient number of dangers already. Abolition would throw against us, irrevocably, the four State of Missouri, Kentucky, Virginia and Maryland, which it is costing the nation such efforts to regain. We have our hands full as it is, and if there is to be any such suicidal legisla tion, we might as well cut loose at once, and be gin taking up the arteries to prevent our bleed-in- u d th. 1 ' Sensible. cw from the Indian Country W. A. Burleigh, Esq., Indian Ageut .it Yanc ton Reserve, Dacolah Territory, nine hundred miles up the Missouri from St. Joseph, passed over the Indian Central Railway yesterday morning tnrnmtt to Washington. He brings tilling-- of peace and plenty from the Tanctous, Sioux and other neighboring tribes. Stbiee Thbee, the great chief oi the Y .melons, who has eight hundred powerful warriors, recently visited the Pawnees and other tribes south of the Missouri, assuring litem that as long as peaceable, he would be friendly, but the moment they raised an arm against the L'nited States Government he would meet them in deadly conflict. Among other preseuls from the Indians, we saw several pairs of slippers made of white buck skin, elegantly ornamented with porcupine quill work, beautifully colored. One pair for the President which perhaps were made out doors and a pair for .ich member of his Cabinet; also, a fine Indian pipe for the entertainment of the Hon. Secretary of State. The Ajpmt left Greenwood, his station, on the '.2.1 inst., coming by stage to St. Joseph. The Missouri was frozen eighteen indies deep, .--.,d the thermometer on the '29th ult., was eight degrees below zero. , . Abolition ( inL'r. siinnl Policy. About sixty Republica.; members f Congress a caucus, called to dr termite the policy that shall be pursued in th. irosecotion of tbe war, unanimously resolved urTi -.he "confiscation of all property of rebels in arms, .;oiof all who aid and abet them, and the unconditional emancipation of their slaves." This policy, we presume, wilVbe incorporated into Congressional legislation, and it is probable that the President will be guided by the recommendations and directions of the legis lative branch of the Government. We can not doubt but that the people of the Southern States upon the question of emancipation will be a unit in opposing it. They hare a common interest, whether loyal or disloyal to the Federal Govern ment, in resisting a scheme, which, if it can be car ried into effect, will be disastrous to all their ma terial interests. The great body of the people of the North have accepted as the object of the war the restoration of the Union under the Con stitution. Tbe sweeping emancipation eherne proposed by the Republican caucus cannot result otherwise than in tbe destruction of the Union a blow upon the progress and prosperity of the entire nation. Production is the wealth of the country. The North has a deep interest, if we are reunited as a nation, in maintaining not only, but still further developing the productive inter ests of the South. Emancipate the slaves and that labor, which certainly has added largely to the wealth of the nation, becomes ot no value. Otherwise, as all must admit who understand the negro character, that class will become a burden to the industry of the other sections of the coun try. This sudden, forcible and inconsiderate freeing of the slaves, is shortsighted, unwise and will be an injury to the rery class for whose well being the negro-abolition philanthro pists pro fees to have so much at heart. It ig time for the conservative sentiment of the North, of the royal border slave States, to put their "foot down" upon a scheme, not demanded by coitfiderations of patriotism, or a regard for the welfare of tlte whole nation. Such a policy will benefit nobody, not even the slaves; and it can only oe prompted by a party spirit as selfish and unwise as it is rancorous. With a very few ex cept ions, two in tle House only, the Republican menilers of Congress in July last, declared, un der tlie solemnity of their official oaths, "iliat in thl" national emergency Congress, banishing all leeliui: of mere passion or resentment, will only recollect its duty to tbe whole country; that Ulis war is not waged upon our part in any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpore of conquest or subjugation, U'.r for the purpose of overthrow iug or interfering with tlie rights or established limitations of the States, but todelend and main tain the supremacy of the Constitution and pre serve the Union, with its dignities, equalities and the rights of the several Slates, unimpaired, and as soon as these objects are accomplished, the war ought to cease." That po icy was right in July ami it is no less right now. The country was assured that such were the objects lor prosecuting the war. Shall we not adhere to them , honestly and in good faith ? These assurances were given to encourage the loyal uili Fnii of the border skuas Stabs end shall we now prove false to them change the object of the war right in the face of the pledge of Con gress that emancipation "the overthrowing or interfering trith the rights or established institu tions of tbe States" were not the purposes for which it wi.s to be waged? Tbe Abolitionists are much bent upon the destruction of the Union as tbe Secessionists, and ii their policy pre vails, as the action of tbe Republican Congres sional caueu foreshadows that it probably will, unless the conservative sentiment of the country promptly performs its duty, no more fatal st.ib can be fciven our national unity and progress. Special Di -.patch to th Ciuettmatl Oazrtte.j Ixdianaolm, Dec. 13. Htm. Morton ha- made an arrangement with Chase bv which the amount due to In for equipping volunteers will be set off against the national tax due from Indiana. This will save tlte State more than half a million of dollars, aud ranke an extra session of th Legis latwjs unnecessary, ami prevent the levying of an increased to tWlMt.v ',-M , This "arr angmnent" of Governor Monroa is m violation of law, and is a breach of good faith toward the holders of the war loan bonds. A law passed at die extra session of tbe Legislature expressly provides that eft the reimbursements by the täte f ecpifping volunteers should first be applied in the purchase of tbe war bends, and if those could not be obtain o I to an to tnViBoney .en eived, the: tke CoiaWM-.r i - A S Sinking-' Fund the (Jkhase we beheM 1 pulated, as flk of the the bends, that tbe State privilege of rate they were sold by paying 7 per interest. This action was in acco uce-1 tm with the policy of the Legislature in thcrizing the loan. So it seems that tbe Gover nor M set at defiance the w!f of the Legialstnre ami assumed an miwuTanted p- wee in his ar rangetnent with Secretary Chase And more than this, he attempts a deception which is too barefaced to deceive any one. lie claims that by setting off the amount due from the General Government to Indiana for advances made by the latter for equipping volunteers, that more than half a million of dollars will be saved to the State. The State owes the money thus set oil, aud in stead of paying 'hat debt tbe Governor appro priates it to another purpose. This Is robbing Peter to pay Paul. We only know of one hypoth esis which will justify the boast of His Excellency that he has saved more than half a million of dol lars to the State by his financial dodge. Perhaps tbe Governor anticipates that this war loan will be repudiated, and by appropriating ths money that should go to the creditors of the State to the payment of our national taxes, that much will be saved by tbe operatiou. Such ap pears to be His Excellency's tden of pub lic integrity and public faith. Hut the great object which the Governor had in view in ma king hie arrangement with Secretary Chase was to prevent the necessity of calling an extra session of the Legislature. He feared the damaging effect that the calling together of that body at the present time would have upon him. He has not the least desire to have his ad ministration go ihn ugh the ordeal of a legisla tive investigation, until his schemes for personal advancement and aggrandizement hare culmi nited. Until then. he will not fare that musk, if it is in his power to prevent it. Never before have the people been so desirous ror an assembling of the Leg islature. They are solicitous to know the con dition of the financial affairs of the State. For months, as the law regulatiug tbe treasury sys tem requires there should be, no monthly or even annual expose has been made of the operations of the Treasury. Why this secresy? And in violation of law, a very large amount of money has been disbursed without p;issing through the Treasury Why should this check upon fraud and errors be disregarded? The administration ol His Excellency thus far may have been char acterized with great skill and integrity, but if so, certainly no good object is to be accomplished by concealing from the people what has been done, or preventing the overeipns of the State from pissing judgment upon it. No mau was more bitter in bis denunciations of the late Governor Willabi for not calling an extra session of the Legislature in 157 than Governor Mortos. The considerations urged why that call should Se made were- infinitesimal in their character and importance compared with those which public policy now demands for assembling the Legisla ture. We do not believe that tbe Republican party even will justify the Goveruor in his at tempts to cover up his official acts and prevent the people from deciding upon tlioir State policy at one of the most important periods in the history of the Suite, and under circumstances entirely unanticipated. Male Convention. There will be a full representation in the Pth of January Democratic State Convention. Tbe Central Committees of the different counties have issued calls for conventions to select delegates. In addition to the cails which we have already published, ws notice the following: On the 14th inst, Owen county; on the 21st, Gibson and Black ford; on the 21th, Vigo and Clark; on the SSth, Elkhart, Knox, Huntington, Wellsand Daviess, and on January 1st, Adams. Thedelegntes thus far selected are among the ablest and best men of the party, and we can safely say that the Con vention will be the most imposing in character and importance ever assembled in tlie State. The President' Course. Tlie course of the President very truly re marks the Albany Argut after all, is to be in were directed jphvbwt thciiKM Newpan All; An; ar ui mi ; i - flkditioni in the wIdo! Slat.' h wee to have tbe : them et the seme . i. cent. , eud terpreted bv the acts of the Administration and duce thp ,eMer at our readers may judge as not by his words. Several of these acts the re to tne ex tout and character of the Union senti movul of Fremont, the coireUon administered to ' ment " North Carolina, and the material which Camfkox, and the instructions to Shfrm n and others place the President on the side of the Constitution, and against the agitators and auar chists. In these acts we find a sufficient motive for Democrats and conservatives to sustain the President wherever they can do so ; and he has only to stand firm in his position to insure the support of the people, irrespective of party. The small faction which assails and conspires against him is loud in tone and insolent in language, but i. --- - .I , . . , t t weak and cowardly when put tc the test. Let . ,, , him take heart and rally the peopie to him, and bi l uenauce to these conspirators. The Coat. The cost of the Chicago Platform to the coun try has no doubt been n subject of consideration with every citizen. It has already added several hundred millions of dollars to the public debt with the prospect of a still further large increase; it has arrayed one section of the country against the other in a gigantic and fierce sanguinary con test, threatening a permanent dissolution of the Union, it has paralyzed industrial pursuits and lessened the value of agricultural products: it has already sacrificed ibe lives of many of our best citizens, and it will sacrifice thousands mors in the effort to maintain the integrity of the Govern ment; it has arrayed in deadly and unnatural strife father against son and brother against brother: it has excited animosities which will ever prevent die restoration of that Union and loval r . asnl ment which a citizen should ever entertain toward his Government; it has retarded public and pri ate improvements that remarkable pros perity which has characterized our national pro gress, and it has created a doubt as to the per manency of popular institutions and the capacity of the people for self government. And why has this train of evils been forced up m the coun try? What good wau expected to be accom plished that would compensate for our ;resent and anticipated troubles: Nothing but an in- sane ..nd impracticable attempt to make a sub- jective equal to a governing race-to elevate the negro to the stains, or equality, Of j the white man. ff every negro slave in I the nation should to-day be made freemen, it ' is altogether probable it would prove a curse to ; them instead of s blessing. But the sectional hatred and animosity which finds expression in the Chicago Platform we presume will not be . - , ... . . . , . satobed until the whole country is impoverished and burdened with a debt to be handed down as a legacv to the generations who will follow us and a- . memento of the folly and marine of the When the sober ttioHght ot the people returns, the makers of the Chicago Plat form will be swept into oblivion by the resistless tuie of a healthy, but indignant paldic sentiment.

Our loyalty we are willing to test with the Journal upon any and all proper occa sions. The present rebellion is the result of law lessness, and a disregard of those restraints Im posed by Government. Now the Journal Is ram pant m favor of the financial measure by which the Governor seeks to pay the tax imposed upon this State. We oppose the plan because It m s violation of law, sad necessarily involves us in an act of bad faith. What are tbe factor Tbe General Assembly at its extra session passed an act which was approvsd by the Goveruor on the lib day of June. IHil, the third section of which reads as follows: "Should the Federal Government at any time hereafter assume the indebtedness incurred by the State of Indiana in providing supplies and men to aid said Government in (Hitting down said rebel lion, the money so paid, or the securities so given in iuc.1 assumption, shall enure to the benefit of the holders of the bonds for payment of which rovision is herein made, and the State Debt Sinking Fund Commissioners are hereby directed to apply tbe funds or securities so given as in this section is contemplated, to the liquidation of the debt, with the payment of which said State Delit Sinking Fund Commissioners are charged, and that said securities shall neither be loaned or otherwise disposed of than in this section pro vided." Section A of said act provides that "In case the holders of tlie bonds of tlie loan herein provided for should refuse to exchange the same for the Federal Government securities, or in case the said bonds could not be redeemed by the said Com missioners at a rate not excoediug their par value, then aud in that case the said State Debt Sinking Fund Commissioners are hereby empowered and directed to invest the funds arising from the tax to be levied for the extinguishment of said loan, and the securities contemplated in section three of this act in tbe S'.j and 5 per cent, stocks of this State." The title to the above act is : "An act making additional provision for tbe payment of the loan of two millions of dollars authorized by tbe act of the Ceueral Assembly, approved Mav 13lh, 161.' Thus stands the law, and we ask who are in rebellion against the Government those who abide by the law and maintain the public integrity, or t hose who propose to disregard and violate the law at the bidding of those who feel that die law .-taiids between them and their ambitious purpo ses 1 The Journal advocates a policy that tram pies the law under foot, whilst we propose to abide by tlie law and observe our engagements with those who hold large amounts of our bonds. Let an impartial public judge between us. We would tie lIhI to avoid the payment of the National as sessment by the levy of a tax to be collected at this time, but the people would prefer that, op pressive as it may be, to a violation of public honor. Will the Journal construe the above sectious as authorizing the course it a.hooales '.' We will see Madison Courier. The North Carolina Convention The most impudent Humbug off the whole h r I it t i est i in; Account of the Manufacture of (Governor, 11. C, A Ac. Some time since, there appeared exclusively in the New York Tribune resolutions purporting to be passed by a Convention of Unionists at Hat teras Inlet, which Convention it was intimated, largely represented the eelings of the population in that State, it being attended by delegates from forty-five counties. These resolutions would have gi ven the greatest gratification to our North ern people, if issued from the interior of the State, and by the people at large, instead of be ing proclaimed from under the guns of the Fed eral forces at the Inlet. The New York Sun publishes a private letter, received in that city from a trustworthy person at the Inlet, which shows that the proceedings of the Convention are not entitled to any respect whatever, and tlie whole affair partakes very much of the character of a humbug. We repro- composed the grand Union Convention in that State: Caiir Wool, Hattehab, Ixlxt, X. C.,) November .10, 1861 . J As for the Union Government in North Caro lina, I fear it is nothing but a big farce. The resolutijus, which you no doubt have read in the papers, began with something like this: "W thn nfcnnl i if Vnrth f"V,rr,li n X- Jlr w0W( the fllct is the wMc of tke M ppIe amounted in all to about one hundred and twenty gnonmt Hatforas fishers and voters, the rest be ing bovs, women and children. This grand con- " . x ,. , vention, representing North Carolina, "free and independent," was addressed by a Tribune re- porter, (the only one here, I believe,) a Mr. ros ter, now an Hon M C , and Gov. Taylor. Well, the resolutions were read by the Governor, and the question of its adoption being put, no one could, at first, be found to second it. Afterwards the form of a man said, "I want to do what is right: I don't know what it means, but I wilt second it." When the vote was put, the "dele gates" looked one at the other, not knowing what to do, but after the resolutions were read over again, some one managed to gain courage enough to vote, and all followed suit. So the Provisional government was established. If this is not a big thing," I don't kuow what is. On the 28th. Mr. Foster was elected to the United States Con gress from this District. A National Bank. It is believed that these is to be a push made at this session of Congress for the adoption of some scheme for tlie issue of a national paper currency. Speculators are in favor of any project which will inhale the currencv. and theiebv enhance nriees. " . - . l .u u no matter how certain or how severe the crash which may follow. In the whole history of the country, from the adoptioa of the Constitution to the present hour, theve never was a time alien an inflated paper currency was so littledematided by the want? of commerce, or, so far as we can see, by the necessitiss of the Government, as at pies ent. We have a hundred million dollars more qold in the country than ever before, aud the quautity is rapidly increasing.

This proves notning in its favor, but only the ignorance of those who take it. A counterfeit bank note does the same thing, and until discovered to be a coun tsHhit is just as efficient to buy commodities as a good specie paving note or a silver dollar. Igno ranee gives it currency. The speculators believe In ignorance as an institution, and it is possible that thev may have calculated on this subject knowingly. For the sake of tbe permanent in terests of the peoule of the Uuited States, w e hope that they will be disappointed, aud that the Euro pean debt method of paying debts, by never pay ing them, under the specious institutions of "funded debt," and "national bank paper cur rency," will never be adopted as an American, system of finance. r . .

The events of tlie ürt week of tbe session of UsBgiess hive proved lue correctness of the views expressed in any letter of November 27. The opposition U) the President, on the part of the radical and ultra members of Congress, has taken the form of a regular organization. This organ ization is led by Sumner and Trumbull in the Senate, ami by Lovqjoy and Thad. Stevens iu tlie House. They boast that they can command seventy seven votes in the House and a clear ma jority in the Senate, and do not hesitate 'jo express their designs openly. They declare tiiey have nothing to hope from the Presioent, who, they are convinced, is iahw ta all his pledges, and has sold himself to the slaveholders. But. at tlie same lime, they assert that iliev fear nothing that the President can do to thwart their designs. They are confident of being able, in the course of the next two months, to command a two third vote iu both houses on any question they may bring up. As soon as they reach that point, they propose to carry over the President's veto (for they know he will veto them) tlie following measures: 1. A joint resolution declaring that slavery is the cause of the war, and that it is impossible to bring the war to a successful issue without abol ishing slavery wherever it exists; - Tbe total and unciMiditioual repeal of the fu gitive slave law; 3. Tlie passage of a bill declaring free, an I ordering our Generals, to offer freedom to all slaves who shall leave dcir masters; 4. Thepissage of a bill confiscating mil the property of the rebels, including their slaves: 5. The passage of a joint resolution requesting the President to dismiss Gen. McClellati, and to appoint Gen. Banks Commander in Chief of tbe armies of the United Slates iu his place. 6. The passage of a bdl obliterating tbe bound ary line between the States of North Carolina and South Carolina, (vasodilating tlie two States into one, and calling theme State "Carolina." The bills for effecting these objects are already drawn up, and are beiiif privately circulated. I have een a complete -el oi them (one ol each), j with interlineations and erasures in the handwrit ing of one of the great iigh priests of Abolition ism. Tlie President is fully aware of the powerful combination that has betn formed against him. Aud while 1 will do him the justice to say that he is insensible to fe-ir, I mtst also add that he lacks that firmness aud deciiiou of character which alone can enable him to withstand it effectually, ; and to overcome it. One of the most prominent characteristic of his ruiad is his habit of permit ting manors to drift os and to regulate them selves. The historian who, in future yens, writes the history of this war will show that this, and this alone, was tlie cause ot the fall of Fort Slimier. To use his own homely illustration, he wants "to run the machine he finds it," and is unwilling to take the responsibility of putting it in that order in which alone it ought to run. On the present occasion, it is iu his power to rally around him not only all th conservative men in Congress, but all the conservative men ii the nation, and to crush tins atrocious conspiracy in the bud. But up to this hour he has done noth ing in that direction. Nay, worse than that, he is inclined to lemporixe witft the unscrupulous faction which is uuderminiug his Adminis tration. The whole country awaited his message with braathlessguspeu.se. But the whole country turns away from it, sick with disappoint ment. It is silent on the verv topic of all others that the nation is most anxious to have settled Mr. Lincoln has had the repuation of being plain and straightforward. But he has been anything but plain and straightforward in his public mes saj:e. No one could tell whether his inaugural meant peace or war. The whole country wran gled over it until the guns of Fort Sumter sett led that point. In this message he will not say what ought to be done towards the negroes. The only point on which he is explicit is his reaffirmation that the Chicago platform is a law unto him. If, instead of this faux pas, Mr. Lincoln had said frankly in his message that he preferi-ed a course towards the slaves such as has been inaugurated by Gn. Dix and Gen. Halleck, there would have been no more doubts as to where he stands. That one declaration would have rallied around him all the conservative men ot the nation. Every conservative member of Congress, too, would have rallied to his suppoil. and he would have found himself at tlie head of a party in Congress powerful enough to defy the radicals to do their worst. He may do so yet. He can not do so now. 1 think, from present indications, that there is little prospect of tbe establishment of a National Armory and Arsenal at Chicago. There are too many cont'Jiiding interests here so permit that. Several other cities are alleged to possess greater interests for that purpose. Pittsbuig will be fa vored by those in auHiority, and at present it looks as if it miht be fixed at that city. In re gard to the prospect of the enlargement of the canal, however, so as to connect the waters of tlie Mississippi and of the (treat Lakes by means of a canal through which ships may pass, there is a better prospect of success. It will be re membered that many years ago the late lamented Senator Douglas urged u ion Congress the im portauee of doing this. Il looks as if it would be done now. It depends almost whollv, how ever, upon the manner iu which the subject is j handled by the Illinois delegation iu Congress; and I am happv to bear teiimonv to the able ! manner its which Mr. Arnold is pressing this mat tor.

The President replied, refusing to famish the correspondence. A portion of it has at last been wrung from the Suite Department, and is now published. It dis closes the highly important fact that, as long ago as the first week in June, both the English and French Govern mentsharj I decided on the same course of conduct toward the Confederate States, and had instructed their respective ministers to the L'nited States to call upon Mr. Seward, and notify him, in the most formal manner, that those two nations had decided to recognize the Confederate States as a belligerent pow er, and to give them all the rights of belligerents. Mr. Seward says so in his letter to Mr. Davton of June 1; and he says that those ministers did call upon him, in nrnpany, on tbe 1 5th of June, and did, each one, hand tc him a dispatch of that pur port from their respective ministers of foreign affairs. True, Mr. Seward refused to receive these dispatches, or to communicate them to Con gress; but that does not alter tbe fact that both France and England recoguize the Confederate States as a belligerent power. The readers of the Tims are no doubt familiar with the desire of Mr. Cameron as expressed in his report, to dismember the State of Virginia, to blot her from the map, and to partition her ter ritory among three other contiguous States. The cold-blooded atrocity of the proposal is worthy of the brain of an Eastern despot, and iu malignity strikes even deeper than has yet appeared. Strik ing ostensibly at the "Old Dominion," it is in re ality at the State of Maryland that the blow is aimed. Tbe wicked proposal of the Secretary of War would literally tear Maryland limb from limb He proposes to give eight of her counties fall that portion of her territory east of Chesapeake Bay tots, and Uro counti j most ion called . id' uiof lhan ball in Lave uas eleven coi dti::. gomen ore, Harvard, Carroll, v, Howard, Charlc PSjgrwg, jaary s, waivert ami Anne Arundel. Mr. Came- ron men proposes to jo.n to tins msiginni ant iac tion of Maryland sixty-nine counties of Virginia Hut, instead of doing '.his, it will be the eleven Maryland co en ties that are joined to Virginia. These sixty nine Virginia couuties cousiitute that part of Virginia in which all the peculiari ties which constitute Virginia are to be found, and whatever name may be givsn to it, it will al ways be the true Virginia.

The comparatively few in habitants in the eleven Maryland counties will be completely swallowed up, over-balanced and out voted on every question by the inhabitants of tlie sixty nine Virginia counties. Thus tbe measure will result in tue complete obliteration of tlie State-, both of Virginia and Maryland.

The atmosphere of Washington has decidedly a modifying effect upon our distinguished Jov ernoT. When Frkxo.vt issued his celebrated proclamation His Excellency coincided therewith, and even weut to St. Louis, at tlie invitation of Jswsjg, to express his cordial approval of the then Commander of the Army of the West. Perhaps he thought that General Frkmoxt reflected the views of the President, but since tlie modi tie a -tion of the Pathfinder's proclamation and the report of the Secretary of War, we find that Governor Mortok, unwilling to lose the confi dence and good wrll of Honest Old Abk, follows closely in his wake The special Washington dispatches to the Cincinnati Gazette and Commrr- cial, dated the 7th, thus present.- the views uow entertained by our Chief Magistrate: Governor Morton snoke for Indiana, which he said had thirty seveu thousand soldiers in the field; and would give its last dollar aud man to restore the Union. He had no doubt of onr ulti mate triumph. The war on the part of the North has thu far beftn maintained for the suppression of the rebellion and the restoration of the Union; and he trusted for this purpose alone it would be prosecuted. We should use every means known to civilized warfare, but do nothing which, from the nature of the case, might make a restoration of the Union impossible. In the main we agree most cordialh with the sentiments expressed by His Excellency, but it is a little singular that the Governor should remark in Washington that Indiana " would give its last dollar and man to restore the Union," yet in Indiana, before he went to the national capital, he declared that the attempt to collect the direct tax from the citizens of this State would excite an opposition to the Government which would be tantamount to rebellion. Oovemor Mortok is loud in his protestations of the patriotism of In diana when abroad, but he places the State in a position of disloyalty when at home. The Crittenden Resolution be Honae, voted o o II l n In the House of Representatives on Wednesday ht Mr. Holwas of this State, submitted the fol lowing preamble and resolution and moved tlie previous question: Whkreas, This House on the 22d of July last, by an almost unanimous vote, adopted the follow ing resolution submitted by the Hon. J.J. Crit tenden of Kentucky: Resolved, By the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States, that the pres cut deplorable war has been forced upon the country by the Disunionists of the Southern States now in revolt against the Constitutional Government, and in arms around the capital, that in this national emergeney, Congress, ban ishing all feelings of mere passion or resentment, will only recollect its duty to tlie whole country; that this war is not waged upon our part iu any spirit of oppression, nor for any purpose of con -(pest or subjugation, nor for the purpose of over throwing or interfering with the rights or estab lished institutions of the States, but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution ami to preserve the Cmon with its dignities, equality, and tlie rights of the several States unimpaired, and that as soon as these objects are accomplih ed the war ought to cease; and, Whkekas. Since that time no event has occur red to change the feelings of the Government; therefore, Resolved, That the principles almve expressed are snlemly reaffirmed by this House. Mr. Stkvks8 moved that the resolution be laid on the table, which was carried by a vote of 71 ! aves to 5 navs. Our delegation stood as fol lows against Holman's resolution, Messrs. Col fax, .TrLiAN, Shanks and Whitk; for H, Messrs. Cravens, Di nn, Holxtatv, Law, Mitctikll and Poktfji. Mr. Voobheks absent. The Republi cans claimed great conservatism for their party in consequence of the almost unanimous vote for Crittenden resolution at tlie extra session of Congress. We thought at the time that the vote was a hypocritical expression on the part of many of the Republican members who voted for it, and tlie vote upon the resolution of Mr. Hoi. man, which simply affirmed the Cuittevpkn resolu tion, demonstrates that such was the case. As the record now stands a majority of the Republi can members say "that the wiw is waged upon our part in a spirit of oppression, for the purpose of conquest and subjugation and for the purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights or established institutions of States not to defend and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution or to preserve the Union with it dignities, equal ity and the rights of the several States unim paired, and that the war ought not to cease unti these objects are accomplished " The Civil War in America.

Our Army CorrewpondenceTbe 7th Indiana in Western Virginin. GatEN SraiNo, Ya., on tue Ohio R. R., December 7th, 1861. (j Eniroa Sentinel: One week ago this morning the 7th regiment Indiana volunteers left Elk Water camp for Romney, and yesterday eveuiug we stopped at this station whfch is sixteen miles from Cumberland, M .rvland, between that place and the city of Baltimore. Of the particulars of our trip to tlie railroad I do not wish to write, for the reason that no pen could do it justice, much : less mine. For three successive nights the men of the regiment slept in the open air, with noth J ing but their blankets to protect them and noth- ing whatever to eat except such as fortune threw i in their wav, or more properly- speaking, what thev could wring from the hands of fortune after running her down. The roads were so intolera bly bad that all were astonished at the seeming ' impossibilities which were overcome. It was no i uncommon occurrence to see abandoned wagons j and dead horses lying by the road side, and the ! only wonder is there were not a great many more. At Beverly the tents and much other baggage were left in order to further lighten the loads, and it was then only by doubling and trebling teams j they made out to reach Phillipi. The remainder of the way was frozen and we got along very well. One thing was however exceedingly gratifying, and that was the cheerfulness and vivacity of tlie men, who all seemed to look at it more as a i frolic than a stern reality in which there was nothing but the most arduous labor. But when tlie sight of the railroad greeted their eyes, sor rows, sore feet and privations al alike were for gotten and their joy knew no bounds. I acknowl edge if I ever partook ot the joys others felt this was one of the occasions. In fact to have not done so would have been criminal. As we passed through some twelve or fifteen miles of Maryland yesterday morning it really seemed to me as if we were ou the confines of Eden. In truth the country 1 refer to is in a very high state of eiiltivati. m. the country residences being as ftne as any I have ever seen where the locality is so far from a large city; the inhabi tants having, in addition to their agricultural abundance, a large amount of mineral wealth. But to us all the transition was as sudden as it was gratifying. There w as a heartiness of Union sentiment evinced bv the waving of white hand kerchiefs by fair hands at almost every house we passed, which was all tbe more exhilarating when m. betweei. of for f who whine for the of : i er m a;. 9 r or a white yellow Whv, to be t night before last I should crazv.

They heard we were coming aud no doubt "chose the better part.' For my part I did not go, it senschow happens when I am at my maddest there is do one about. We sleep on the cars to-night and are ordered to move out seven miles toward Romnev in the iiioniiner. to a nlncc I called Springfield. Well, as ordeved, our wagon train was loaded j and in motion, with the regiment arann up in j order behind it, ready to move, whea a dispatch - came from General Kelley countermanding all. I and we were ordered to pitch tents and await fur ther instructions, for which all felt thankful, and i acted accordingly. How long we may remain I here I know not, but probably but for a shut ; time as I think a battle of moment will soon be I fought. Tlie enemy are ia large force at W in chc-ter, winch is forty miles from Romney. and a gooc turnpike all the way, and it is thirty -si i miles there from this railroad at die mouth of the Big Capin creek, twenty eight miles lielow here.

It is enough to make the heart ache for one to stand on the bank of this river and think its bright, laughing waters live the shore of tbe hallowed home where lie t e bones of the sainted Washington. Ah! little did the patriot sage and warrior think, as in his dying struggle he ami a century were contending for tlie mastery, that but little over half a century would elapse before a worthless descendant of a worthy race w ould tarnish a name, rendered im mortal by tlie illustrious chief whose home was once Mount Yernou. May heaven iu its mercy give us more strength to cherish and nourish all good, both public and private, but above all may we articulate more clearly, swear more earnestly and pungently when it becomes our duty tod n traitors both at home and abroad. H. F. K. Our Ar U) Correspondence-The Indiana In .VJianonri. Camp or the t IlsUXi ox the La MrwE.r December 18, lenl. Deak Editos: To-day is, to use a very com mon expression, "heavy weather." The dull, leaden clouds hover over our heads like some great nark spectre, aud the thunder bounds like a ball through the heavens, its rumbling dving awav in tlie distant skv, but to again with renewed vigor. This betokens a storm which is no joke in camp, to wade in mud and water two or three feet deep, with Gov ernment shoes and leaky at that, and then ss if to cool the patriotism that fired our souls hen we swore ourselves in for the war, to lay down our weary bones and rest in the same unpleasant combination of solids and liquids; but in the lan guage of James Buchanan, when he crossed tbe Rubicon; "Sich is life." This is the third day of our stay here, but many more will we experience before we hear the cheers that ring through the camp ou the recep- i tou "niarching orders." We are now on the f ground of our winter quarters; said quarters will be in the course of erection by the last ol tbe week. To day Col. Shook is out with a hundred and fifty men, felling trees and hewing them into puncheons, boards and logs for our canton ments. Yesterday Lieut. Smith with fifty men made a splendid road sixty feet wide and one hundred yards long, running tlie length of our camp, that being our share of the work, and the otlier legi m et its continuing it on through the brigade. When we gel our log city nuilt. it will be a good opening for some artist to show his taleut. Gen. Pope to-day sent a very important order to headquarters, the import of which is that no wagous will be allowed to leave camp without an escort commanded by a commissioned officer. It has been clearly ascertained by deserters from Price, that it is his (Price's) intentijn to give battle ou no account, but keep the main body of his army on tlie other side of the Osage and send out small bands of his men to cut off our supplies and capture small squads of our men a- they roam away from camp. Sunday a team I or train of too wagous were taken when within j three miles of Sedalia, but were recaptured by ' onr men. Sedalia is the extreme end of the Pa i cific Railroad, two miles from our former camp, 'Georgetown.) and sixteen miles southwest of our present eucampment. We know the news is is reliable concerning Price and his marauders, and me will keep a sharp eye on them We in vite them to come here, as they are welcome to all tlie teams w-e have, if they can take them. I suppose yob remember Walt. 0'Kmc, who was a member of Ben. Lang's school and a clerk of Stewart &. Bowen. His old friends will be surprised to hear that he is Colonel of a rebel regiment station', d at Warsaw. An old gentle man from Indiana, accompanied by Sam John sou, of the 4. M Department, went to Humans ville after bis sou, who was leak at that place ran sick, and from there went tm Warsaw, wheie O'Kaue's and Hales's regiments are stationed. They were taken before O'Kaae. w1k questioned them wliere they were from, their business, aad whether they were soldiers. Johnson told them they were citizens of Indiana, and came all tbe way from home to get the sick man. They ware treated very kindly, and received a pass from O'Kane through his" lines. They were molested but once, and theu by a party of drunken men alio had broken guard and were returning to their camp. After showing the pass the soldiers let them go. Gen. Stone, of Indiana, is berc collecting the money that the boys wish to send borne to their families He has received from but three com panies of our regiment, and the amount sums ap twenty seven bond red dollars.
