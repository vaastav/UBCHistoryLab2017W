FOREIGN RELATIONS. (iRKAT BRITAIN. Our relations with Great Britain are of the most friendly character. Since the com mencement of my administration, the two dangerou3 questions arising from the Clay ton and Bulwer treaty, and from the right of search claimed by the British Govern ment, have been amicably and honorably ad justed. The discordant construction of the Clayton and Bulwer treaty between th two Governments, which, fU different periods of the discussion , bore a threatening as pect, have resulted in a final settlement en- j tirely satisfactory to this Government. In my last Annual Message, I informed Con gress that the British Government had not then completed arrangements witli the Re public of Honduras and Nicaragua, in pur suance of the understanding between the two Governments. It is, nevertheless, con fidently expected that this -ood work will ere long tie accomplished. This confidence has since been fulfilled. Her Brit tunic Ma jesty concluded a treaty with Honduras on the 2sth November, 1 859, and with Nicara gua on the 28th August, 1800, relinquish ing the Mosquito Protectorate; besides, by the former, the Bay Islands are recognized as a part of the Republic of Honduras. It may be observed that the stipulations of these treaties conform in every important particular to the amendments adopted at London on the 17th of October, 1350, be tween the two Governments. It will be recol lected that this treaty was rejected by the British Government, because of its objection to the just and important amemlmeut of the Senate, to the article relating to Ruatan and the other islands in the Bay of Honduras. It is a source of sincere satisfaction to all classes of our fellow citizens, and especially to those engaged in foreign commerce, that the claim on the part of Great Britain forcibly to visit ami search American mer chant vessels on the high seas, in time of peace, has been abandoned. This was ttir the most dangerous question to thepeuce of the two countries which has existed since the war of ISI'2. Whilst it remained open, they might at any moment nave teen pre cipitaled into a war. This was rendered manifest by the exasperated state of public feeling throughout our entire country, pro duced by the torcible ae.irch of American merchant vessels by British cruisers on the coast of Cuba in the spring of 1858. The American people hailed with eeneral acclaim the orders of the Secretary of the Navy, to our naval force in the Gulf of Mexico, to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas from search or detention by the vessels of war of any other nation. These orders might have produced an immediate collision between the naval forces of the two countries. This was most fortunately prevented by an ap peal io the justice of Great Britaiivand to ihe law of nations, as expounded by her own most eminent jurists. The only ques tion of any importance which still remains opeu is the disputed title between the two Governments to the island of San Juan, iu the vicinity of Washington Territory. As this question is still under negotiation, it is not deemed advisable at the. present mo ment to make any allusion to the subject. The recent visit of the l'rince of Wales in appropriate character to the people of this country, has proved to be a most auspicious event. In iu consequences it cannot fail to increase the kindred and kindly feelings Which, I trust, may ever ac tuate the governments and people of both countries in'4heir political and social inter course with each other. 

FRANCE. Wilh Fiance, our ancient and powerful ally, our relations continue to be of the most friendly character. A decision has recently been made by a French judicial tribunal, with the approbation of the Im perial Government, which cannot fail to foster the sentiments of mutual regard that have so long existed between the two countries. Under the French law no person can serve in the armies of France unless he is a French citizen. The law of France recognizing the natural right of expatriation, it follows as a necessary con sequence that a Frenchman, t.v tne tact or , i f v. rT;,.j havin become a citizen of the United States, has changed his allegiance and has lost his native character. He cannot, then-fore, be compelled to serve in the French armies, in rase he should return to his native country. These principles were announced in 1852, by the French Minister of War, and in two late case have been confirmed by the Freii. h Judiciary in that two natives of France have been discharged from the French army because they had become American citizens. To employ the lan guage of our present Minister to France, who has rendered Government service on this occasion: I do not think our French naturalized fallow-citizens will hereafter ex perience much annoyance on this subject. I venture to predict that ihe time is not far distant when the other continental powers will adopt the same wise and just policy, which has done go much honor to the ' en lightened Government of the Emperor. In any evcut, our Government is bound to pro tect the rights of our naturalized citizens every where to the same extent. Although they had not drawn their iirst breath in this country, we cannot recognize a distinc tion between our native and naturalized cit izens. , 

RUSSIA. Between the great Empire of Russia and the United States, the mutual friendship . and regard which has so long existed, still r continued to prevail, and if possible to in crease. Indeed our relations with that Em pire are all that we could desire. SPAIN'. Our relations with Spain are now of a more complicated, though less dangerous character than they have been for many .. j -.r i 1 1 years, cur citizens uau iuug uciu uuu f us iroiecuou aim lunueuce, uui luuo hum continue to hold numerous claims against the i intercourse with that distant ami interesting Spanish Government. These had been ably people will rapidly increase. The ratifiea urged for a series of years by our succes- '. tious of the treaty were exchanged with ua sive diplomatic agents at Madrid, but with- i usual solemnity. For this purpose the Ty oiit obtaining redress. The Spanish Gov- j coon had accredited three of his most dis erument finally agreed to institute a joint ; tinguished Ministers Plenipotentiary, who commission for the adjustment of these were received and treated with marked dis claims, and on the 5th day of March, 1800, j linctiou and kindness both by the Govern- concluded a convention for that purpose with our present Minister in Madrid. Cn- - ier tnis convention, what have been rtpnnm- ; inated the Cuban claims, amounting, to $12S,G35 54, in which more than one hun i dred of our fellow citizens are interested, were leeogmzeu, ana toe Spanish government agreed to pay one hundred thousand dollars ! of this amount within three months follow ing the exchange of ratifications. The pay i merit of the remaining $28,635 54 was "to ; await the decision of the commissioners for ; or against the Amistad claim, but in any -event the balance was to be paid to the ' claimants either by Spain or the United States. These term3 I have every reason to know are highly satisfactory to the bold- ers of the Cuban claims. Indeed, they j have made a formal offer, authorizing the j State Department to settle these claims, and j to. deduct the amount of the Amistad j claim from the sums which they are enti j tied to receive from Spain. This offer, of course, cannot be accepted. All other j claims of citizens of the United States j against Spuin, or of subjects of the Queen ! of Spain against the United State", includ ing the Amistad claim, were by tbia Con vention referred to a Board of Commission ers in the usual form. Neither the validi ty of the Amistad claim, nor any other claim against either party, with the single exception of the Cuban claims, was recog nized by the convention. Indeed, the Spanish Government did not insist that the validity of the Amistad claim should be recognized, notwithstanding its payment had been recommended to Congress bv two of my predecessors, as well as myself, and an appropriation for that purpose bad pawed the Senate of the United States. They were content that it should be submitted to the Board for exam ination and decision, like the other claims. Both Governments were bound, respective ly, to pay the amounts awarded to toe sev eral claimants at such times and places as may be fixed by and according to the tenor of aii awards, and transmitted this con vention to the Senate for their constitution al action, on the third of May, 1800, and on the 27th of the succeeding June, they de termined that they would not advise and consent to its ratification. '- These proceed ings placed our relations with Spain in an awkward and embarrassing position. It is more than probable that the final adjust ment of these claims will devolve upon my successor. I reiterate the recoiiimcnd.itiou contained in my Annual Message of Decem ber, 1858, and repeat that of December, 1859, in favor of the acquisition of Cuba from Spain by fair purchase. I firmly be lieve that such an acquisition would con tribute essentially to the well being and prosperity of both countries, in all future time, hs well as prove the cvrluiu means of immediately abolishing the African slave trade throughout the world. I would not repeat this recommendation upon the pres ent occasion, if I believed that the transfer of Cuba, to the United Slates upon condi tions highly favorable to Spain could just ly tarnish the national honor of the proud and uucient Spanish monarchy. Surely no person ever attributed to the first Napoleon a disregard of the national honor of France for transferring Louisiana to the United States for a fair equivalent, both iu money and commercial advantages. 

AUSTRIA, ETC. With the Emperor of Austria, and the re maining continental powers of Europe, in cluding that of the Sultan, our relations continue to be of the most friendly charac ter. CHIN' A. The friendly and peaceful policy pursued by the Government of the United States to wards the Empire of China, has produced the most satisfactory results. The treaty of Tientsin, of the 18th of June, 1858, has been faithfully observed by the Chinese au'hori ties. The Convention of the 8th November, 1858, supplementary to this treaty for the adjustment and satisfaction of the claims of our cit izens in Chiua, referred to in my last annual message, has already been carried into effect so far as this was practicable. Under this convention, the sum of 500,000 taels, equal to about $700,000, was stipula ted to be paid in satisfaction of the claims of American citizens, out of the one-fifth of the receipts for tonnage, import and ex port duties on American vessels at the ports of Canton, Shanghai and Fuchow, and it was agreed that this amount shall be in full liquidation of all claims of American citi zens at the various ports to this date. De bentures for this amount, to-wit: 300,000 taels for Canton, 100,000 for Shanghai, and 100,000 for Fuchow, were delivered accord ing to the terms of the convention, by the respective Chinese Collectors of the Customs of these ports, to the agent selected by our .Minister to receive the same. Since that time claims of our citizens have been adjust ed by the Board of Commissioners appoint ed for that purpose, under the act of March 3, IS 59, and their awards, which proved satifactory to the claimants, have been ap proved by our Miuistcr. In the aggregate they amount to the sum of $498,694 78. The claimants have already received a large proportion of the sums awarded to them out of ihe fund provided, and it is confidently expected that the remainder will erelong be entirely paid. After the awards shall have been satisfied, there will remain a surplus of more than $'200,000 at the disposi tion of Congress. As this will in equity belong to the Chinese Govern ment, would not justice require its appro priation to some benevolent object in which the Chinese may be especially interested '.' Our Minister to China, in obedience to his instructions, has remained perfectly neutral in the war between Great Britain and France and the Chinese Empire, although iu conjunc tion with the Russian Minister, he was ever ready and willing, had the opportunity of fered, to employ his good offices in restoring peace between the two parties. If is but an act of simple justice, both to our present Minister and his predecessor, to state they have both proved fully equal to the delicate, trvino- and responsible positions in which i they have on different occasions been placed. j 

JAPAN. ' The ratifications of the treaty wilh Ja ! pan, concluded at Yeddo, on the 29th of ! July, 1858, were exchanged at Washington j on the 22od of May last, and the treaty it self was proclaimed on the subsequent day , There is good reason to expect that under :.. . . 1 o 4-.lA . I mentand people of the. United Stages. There is every reason to believe that - they have re turned to their natie land entirely satisfied with their visit and inspired by the most friendly feeling3 for our country ; and let usardentlv hope, in the language of the treaty itself, that there ghal rVni-eforwarJ The perpetual peace and friendship between the United States of America an I his Ma jesty the Tycoon of Japan and his succes sors. , . BRAZIL. ., ,, .. With the wise, conservative and liberal Government of the Empire of Brazil, our relations continue to be of the most amica ble character. NKW OHANAHA. . The exchange, of the. ratiticatipijs. of file convention with the republic of Xey Granada, signed at Washington on the 10th of September, 1857, has been long delayed from accidental ea.ises, for which neither party is answerable. These ratifications were duly exchanged in thi city on the 5lh of Xnvembw last. Thus hns a controversy been amicably terminated which had become so serious at the period of my inauguration as to require me, on the flb of -VprjUi 1857- Ui direct our Minister to demand his passports and return to the United State.'-'. Under this condition the Government of New Granada has specially acknowledged itself to be responsible to our cUiens for, damages which were caused by fhe'riot .'n't Panama on the 15th of April, 1850. These claims, together with other cl iinis of our citizens which hail been long urged in vain, are referred for adjustment to a Hoard of Com missioners. I submit a copy it the-Convcn tion to Congress, and recommend the legis lation necessary to carry it into ell'ect. COSTA UIPA AVI NKAKAGFA. Persevering efforts have been made for the adjustment of the claims of American citizens against the Government of Costa Rica, and I am happy to inform you that these have finally prevailed. A Conven tion was sinned at the city of Srin .Tose on the. 2d of July last, between the Minister j resident of the United States in Costa Rica and the Plenipotentiaries of that Re- I public, referring these claims to a Board of j Commissioners, and providing for the -pir : merit of their awards. This Convention 1 will be submitted to the Senate for their coustilutiurial action. " The claims of ocr citizens upon the Republic of Nicaragua have not yet beeu provide. 1 for by treatv, although diligent efforts for this purpose have been made by our Minister resident to that Republic. Tnese are still continued, with a fair prospl-ct of success. 

MEXICO. Cur relatione-with Mexico remain in a most unsatisfactory condition. Iu my two last annua.! messages I 'discussed extensively the Mibjcct of these relations, and do not now propose, to repeat at length the- facts and argumenti then presented; they proved conclusively thai our citizens resid ing in Mexico, and our merchants trading thereto, had suffered a series of wrongs and outrages such as we have never patiect'y borne from any nliou. Fvr. these our suc cessive ministers, invoking the faith of treaties, had, iu the name of their country persistently demanded redress and indem nification, but without the slightest effect. Indeed, so confident had the Mexican, nn ihorities become of our patient endurance, that they universally' believed they might commit these outrages upon American citi zens with aloIute impunity. Thus- wrot our Minister in 1850, and expreij&d. the opinion that nothing but a manifestation of the power of the Government, and of its purpose to punish these wrongs, will avail. Afterwards, in 1S57, came the adoption of a new Constitution fur Mexico, the election of a President and a Congress under its provisions, and the inauguration of the President. Within one short month, how ever, this President was expelled from the Capital by a rebellion iu the army, and the supreme power of the Republic was assigned to General Zuloaga. This usurper was iu his turn soon compelled to retire from the place by General Miramon. Under the con stitutionrwhich had thus lietin adopiej, Senor Juarez, the Chief Justice of the Su preme Court, became the. lawful President of the Republic, and it. was for the mainte-" nance of the Constitution ami his authority, derived from it, that the civil war .com menced, and still continues to lie prosecuted. Throughout the year 1858, the Constitution al party grew stronger andstrongerj In the previous history of Mexico, i suc cessful military revolution at. the Capital had most universally been the signal for submission throughout the Republic. Not so on the present. A majority of the citi zens presistently sustained the Constitution al Government when this was recommend ed in April, 1859, by the Government of the United States. Its authority extended over a large majority of the Mexican States and people, including Vera Cmz and all the other important seaports of the Republic. From that period our commerce with Mexi co began to revive, and ihe Constitutional Government has afforded it all the protec tion in their power. Meanwhile the Gov ernment of Miramon still held sway at the Capital and over th surrounding comitry, and continued its outrages upon the few American citizens who still had the courage to remain within its power. To cap the climax, after the battle- of -TWubayn,"- In April, 1859, Gen. Marques ordered three citizens of the Uuited States, two of theiu physicians, to be. seized in: tjjie hospital in that place, and t.-ik-en-'and 'shot without trial. This was done, notwithstanding our unfortunate -countrymen were, at the tno- ment, engaged in the holy cause of offering relief to the soldiers of both parties who had been wounded in the battle, without making any distinction between them. The time had arrived, in my opinion, when this Government was bound to exert its power to avenge acd redress the wrongs of our citizens, and afford them protection in Mex ico. The interposing obstacle was, that the country under the sway of Miramon could not be reached without passing over territo ry under the jurisdiction of the Constitu tional Government. Undcf these circum stances I deemed it my duty to recommend to Congress, in my last annual message, the employment of a sufficient military force to penetrate into the interior, where the Government of Miramon was to be found, with, or if need be Without, the con sent of the Juarez Government, and though it was not doubted that his consent could be obtained. Never have I had a clearer conviction on any subject than of the jus tice, as well as wisdom of such a policy. No other alternative was left, except the entire abandonment of tur , fellow-cUAzen3 who had gone to Mexico under the faith of treaties, to the systematic injustice, cmelty and oppression of Miramon's Government; beside?, it is certain that a simple authority to employ the force would, of itself, have 'accomplished all our objects, without strik ing a single blow. The Constitutional Gov- ' ernment would then have been established at the City of Mexieo, and would have been ready and willing, to the extent of its abili ty, to do us justice iu addition ; and I deem this a most important consideration. Other Governments would thus have been depriv ed of all pretext to interfere in the territo iial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should thus have been relieved from the ob ligation of resisting, even by fore, should tltisr become necessarv, any attempt by these Governments to deprive our neighboring Republic of portions of her territory, a duty from which we could not shrink witho'ut abandoning the traditional and established policy of the American people. Iam happy to observe that firmly relying upon the jus tice and good faith' of these Governments, there is no present danger that such a con tingency will happen. Having discovered that my recommendations would not be sus tained by Congress, the next alternative was to accomplish m some degree, it possible, the same objects by treaty stipulations with the constitutional Government. Such treaties were accordingly concluded by our lateab'e and excellent Minister to Mexico, and on the 4th January last were submitted to the Senate for, ratification. As these have not. received the final action of that body, it would be improper for me to present a de tailed statement of their provisions. Still I may be permitted to express the opinion in advance that they are calculated to promote the agricultural, manufacturing and com mercial interests of the country, and to secure our just influence with an adjoining Republic, es to whose fortune and fate we can never feel indifferent, whilst at the same time- they provide for the payment of a considerable amount towards the satisfaction of the claims of our injured fellow-citizens. 

KANSAS AND UTAH. At the period of my inauguration I was confronted in Kansas by a revolutionary government existing under what is called the Topeka Constitution. Its avowed object was to subdue the Territorial Government by force, and to inaugurate what was called the Topeka Government in its stead. To accomplish i. - object an extensive military organizatic was formed, and its command entrusted t j tne most violent revolutionary leaders. Under these circumstances it be came my imperative duty to exert the whole Constitutional power of the Executive to prevent the flames of civil war from raging in Kansas, which, from the exi-,i g state of the public mind, both Nm"-!, and South, might have exten-ku into -tie neighboring States. The hostile parties in Kansas had been inflamed against each other by emissa ries, both from tho North and South, to a degree of magnitude without parallel in our history. To prevent eventual collision, and to assist the ' Civil ' magistrate!; in enf rcing the laws, a strong detachment of the army was stationed iu the Tcrrilury ready to aid the Marshals ami their deputies while cfli ciallv called upon as a posse com i talus, and io the executiou of' civil and critniual pro cess. Still the troubles iu Kansas cim'd u it have been performed without an ele. tiou by the people. The ballot box is the surest ar biter of disputes among freemen. Under this conviction every proper eObtt was ein ployed to induce the hostile parties to vote at the election of delegates' to frame a State Constitution and afterwards the election , to decide whether Kansas should be a Slave or Free State. The insurgent party refused to vote at either, lost this might be considered a recognition of the Territorial Government established by Congress. A- better spirit, however, seemed soon after to prevail, and the two parties met face to face iu the elec tion held the first Monday of January, 1858, for members of the Legislature and Stale officers under the Leeompton Constitution ; the result was a triumph of the auti-slavery party at the polls. This decision of the ballot-fiox proved clearly that, thin party were in the majority and removed the dan- ! ger of civil war. I rom that lime we have heard nothing of the Topeka Covernmei.t, and all serious danger of revolutionary troubles in Kansas was then at an end. The Leeompton Constitution which had been thus recognized at this State election by the voters of both political parties in Kansas, was transmitted with the request that I should present it to Congress. . This I could not have refused to do without violating my clearest and strongest convictions of duty. The Constitution and all the pro ceedings which, preceded and followed it3 formation were fair and regular on their face ; and I then believed, and experience has proved, that the interests of the people of Kansas would have been best consulted by its admission as a State into the Union, especially as the' majority within a brief period xuld have amended the Constitution according to their will and pleasure. If fraud existed in any or all of these pro ceedings, it was not for the President, but for Congress, to investigate and determine the question of fraud, and what ought to be its consequences. , If at the two first ele.-tions the majority refused to vote it can not be pretended tha. this refusal to exer cise the electoral franchise could invalidate an election fairly held, under lawful au thority, even if they had not subsequently voted at the third election. " It is true that the whole Constitution had not Wen sub mitted to the people, as I always desired, but the precedents are numerous of the ad mission of States into the Union without such submission. It would ill comport with my present purpose to review the proceedings of Congress upon the Leeomp ton Constitution. It is sufficient to observe that their final action has removed the last vestige of revolutionary troubles. The des perate band recently assembled under a no torious outlaw in the Southern portion of the Territory, to resist the executiou of the laws and to plunder peaceful citizens, will, I doubt not, be , speedily subdued and brought to justice. - Had I treated the Lecomption Constitu tion as a nullity, and refused to transmit it to Congress, it i3 not difficult to imagine, whilst realizing tiiu. position of the country at that moment, what would have been the disastrous cons'-'quence, both in and out of the Territory, from such dereliction of duty on the part of the executive. Peace has also been restored within the Territory of Utah, which at the commencement of my admin istration was in a state of open rebellion. This was the more dangerous, as the people, animated by a fanatical spirit, and intrench ed withiu their distant mountain fastnesses, might have made a long and formidable resistance. Cost what it might, it was nec essary to bring them into subjugation to the Constitution and the laws. Sound policy, therefore, aj well as humanity, required that this object should, if possible, be accom- plisbed without the effusion of blood. This could only be effected by sending a military force into the Territory, sufficiently -strong to convince the people that resistance would : be hopeless, and at the same time to offer ' them a pardon tor p,ist offences, on condi tion of immediate submission to the Gov ernment. This policy was pursued with ' eminent success, ami the only cause for re t gret is the heavy, "expenditure ; required, to I march a large detachment of the. army to that remote region, and to furnish its sub-.si3tence.- Utah i now comparatively per.ee- : ful ami quiet. The military force has lieen ! withdrawn, except that portion of it nrces sarv to keep the Indians in check " and to protect the emigrant trains on their-wav to our Paei Sc possessions. ; ' 'i ; finances. .,. In my first ansVaf juessage, I promised to employ my best ' rJtertions, in t-o-operatron with Congress, Jo . reduce thee-tpenditurfs of the Government within the limits of a wise and judicious economy. .An overflow j ing treasury has produced habits of pro5fi i gality and .extravagance which couUoniy be gradually corrected. The work required bote Unie and patience. I applied myself diligently to this task from trie beginning, anu was aided by the able and energetic efforts of the heads of the different execa tive departments. Th result of.. our labors iu this good cause did not appear io the sum total of 'expenditures for the first two years, mainly in consequence of the extra ordinary expenditure iucurred in the ;Utah expedition, and the very Iarga tt mount of the contingent-expenses of Congress. Du ring this period those greatly exceeded the pay and mileage of the members. For the year ending 30th June, 1853, w hilst the pay and mileage amounted to $1,490,214, the contingent expenses; rose to $2,093,309 79 ; and for the year ending June, 1S59,' whilst the pay and mileage amounted to $ 859,. 093 06, the contingent" expen$e3 amounted to 1, 431,505 78. I am happy, however, to be able to inform you that during the last fiscal year, ending on the 30th June, I860, the total expenditures of the Government in all its . branches, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial, exclusive of Public Debt, were reduced to the sum of $55,402,465 4tJ; this conclusively nppears from the books of the Treasury. In the year ending on the 30th June, 1858, the total expenditure, exclusive I of the public debt, amounted to 71,901,-. 129 ti, and that for the year ending 30th June, 1859. to 800,310,220 13 'whilst the books of the Treasury show an ac tual ex penditure of $59,8 18,474 72 for the year ending 30th June, 1860, including $1,040, 007 71 for the contingent expenses ot Con gress. There must be deducted fioci thi3 amount the sum of $4',29(r,0)9 20, with the interest upou it of 15000, appropriated by the act of 15th February, lt00, for the purpose of (supplying; the. expenses of the Post Office Deiarttiient t the year ending ..')tu 01 June, !8o9. 1 his. sum, therefore, justly chargeable to the year 1859, mast tie deducted from the sum of $59,843, 174 82, in order to uncertain the expenditure for tho yenr. eSTing op the 30th. June, 1300, which leaves a hulanoo Rjf the expenditures of that year or$55,0i,4;.'V. 40. - The interest on the public debt,-including Treasury notes, tor the -same .fiscal year ending on the JOtlt of June,' 1800, amounted to 3,177,311,02, which added to the above sum of $55,102,105 1(5, makes' tho aggre gate of $58,579, 780 08. It ought iu justice 10 be observed, that several of the estimates from all the departments Tor the year ending on tko 30th of June, 1860, were reduced by Congress below wiiat was and still is deem ed compatible with the public iuterest, al lowing a liberal margin of $2,500,000 for this reduction and for other causes. It may be safely asserted that the sum of $61,000 000, or at the most, $02,000,000, is amply sufficient to administer the Government, and to pay the interest on the public debt, unless contingent events uhould hereafter render extraordinary expenditures neces sary. This result has been attained in a considerable degree by the care exercised by the approiii'ittl.e dctiHi-lmcnls in entering into public contract. 1 dave myself never interfered with the award of any such con tracts, ejeept in a single case that of the Colonization Society; e F deemed- it3-advisable to leave the responsibility iu each case to the proper head of the Department, with the general instruction that these contracts should always be given to the lowest and beat bidder. It is my opinion'that publie contract are not a legitimate source of pat ronrge, to l-e conferred upon personal or political favorites, but that in all snch casej.a public officer is bound to act for the j Government as a prudent individual would ' act for himself. 

AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. It is with great satisfaction I communi cate the fact that since he date of my hist annual message, not a single slave has been imported into the United States in violation of Ihe laws prohibiting the African Slave Trade. This statement is founded upon a thorough examination and investigation of the subject. Indeed the spirit which pre vailed some time since among a portion of our fellow citizens in favor of this trade, seems to have entirely subsided. Flt.LIlll-STKBlXO. I also congratulate you upon the public sentiment which now exists against the crime of setting on foot military expeditions within the limits of the United States, to proceed from thence and make war upon the people of a State with whom we are at peace. In this respect a. happy change has been affected since the commencement of my administration. It surely ought to be tho prayer of every Christian and patriot, that such expeditions may never receive countenance in our country or depart from its shores. . . -" - 1 TRANSIT IIOTJTES.- It would be a useless repetition to do more than refer, with earnest commendation, to my former recommendations in favor of the Pacific Railroad, or the grant of power to the President to employ the naval force in the vicinity for the protection of the live3 and property of our fellow citizens passing in transit over the different Central American routes, against sudden and law less outbreaks and depredations and also to protect American merchant vessels, their owners aad cargoes, against violent and un lawful seizure and confiscation, in the ports of Mexico and the South American Repub lics, when these may be in a disturbed and revolutionary condition. It is my set tled conviction that without such a power,' we do not afford that protection to those en gaged iu the commerce of the country which they have a right to demand. 

-ELECTION OK MEMBERS OF CONOKKdS. I again recommend to Congress the pas sage of a law in pursuance of the provisions of the Constitution, appointing a day cer tain previous to the 4th of March, iu each year, of arr oid number, for the election of representatives throughout all the States. A similar power has already been exercised with general approbation, in the .appoint ment of the same day throughout the Union for holding- the election' of K lectori" for Presideut and Vice President of the United States. My attention was. earnestly direct ed to this subject from the fact that the 35th Congress terminated on the 3rd of March, 1859, without making Ihe nccesnry appro priation for the service'of . tlv Pot !fi-'' department. I wits then iln-ced to ci-n- iiier the best remedy lir this omission, and an immediate call of Ihe present Congress was the usual resort. Upon inquiry, however, I ascertained that fifteen of the thirty-three States composing the Confederacy, were without representatives, - and that conse quently these fifteen States would be dis franchised on the 4th of March next; ten of them cannot elect Representatives accord ing to State laws, until different periods, extending from the "beginning of August next until the ninth of November, and in my last message I gavB( warning that in 11 time f-sudden - and alarming-daiiper the salvation of our institutions might depend upon the power of the President to assemble a full Congress It meet the emergency. . It is now quite evident that the financial necessities o the Government wilj require a modification of the tariff during your present session, for the purpose of increas ing the revenue. In this respect I idesira ! b reiterate the recommendations contained in my last two annual Messages, in favor of imposing spe cific ineLta&J of ad valorem ilutiea,4n all im ported article! to which these can be proper ly applied. From long observation and ex perience 1 am convinced that specific 'duties are necessary, both to protect the revenue and to secure to our manufacturing interests that amount of incidental encouragement which unavoidably results from a revenue tariff. As an abstract proposition, it may be admitted that ad valorem duties would in theory be the most just nnd equal, but if the experience of this and of all other com mercial nations has demonstrated that such duties cannot be esked and collected with out great frauds upon the revenue, then it is the part of wisdom to resort to specific duties. Indeed, from the vey tiaturc of the ad valorem duty, this must Ijc the result. Under it the inevitable consequence is that foreign goods will lie cntere t at less than their true value. The Treasury will there fore lose the duty on the difference between their real and fictitious value, and to this extent we are defrauded. , The temptations which ad valorem duties present to a dis honest importer, are irresistible. His ob ject is to pass his goods through the Custom House at the very lowest valuation necessa ry to save them from confiscation. In this he too often succeeds in spite of the vigil ance of the Reveuue officers. Hence the re sort to false invoices, one for the purchaser, another for the Custom House, and to other expedients to defraud the Government. The honest importer produces bis Invoice to the collector, stating the actual price at which be purchased the articles abroad. Not so the dishonest importer, and the agent of the foreign manufacturer And bens' it may be observed that a very large proportion of the manufactures imported from abroad are consigned for sale to commission merchants who are mere agents employed by the man ufacturers iu such cases. No actual sale has been made to fix their vatue. The for eign manufacturer, if he be dishonest, pre pares a u invoice of the goods uot at their actual value, but at the very lowest, rate necessary to escape detection. Iu this man ner the dishonest importer and the foreign manufacturer enjoy decided uj vantage over the honest merchant. They arc thus eu abled to undersell the fair trader, and drive him from the market. In fact tlie opera tion of this system has already driven from the pursuit of honorable commerce many if that class of regular aud conscientious mere-ban?, whose character throughout the world is the pride of our country. The remedy for these evils is to lie found in specific duties so far as this may lie practica ble. They dispense with any inquiry at the Custom House into tho acto il eost or value of the article, and its pays the precise amount of duty previously fixed bylaw. They present no temptations to the apprais ers of foreign goods, who receive but small salaries, and might by undervaluation - iti a few cases ren der themselves independent. Besides, specific duties best conform to the requisi-. tion in ibe Constitution, that no preference shall be given by any regulation of com merce or revenue to the ports of one Sluto L over those of another. Under our ad valo rem system, such preferences are to son e extent inevitable, and complaints have often been made that the spirit of this provision has been violated by a lower appraise ment of the same articles at one port ihnti at another, j An impression, strangely enough prevails to some extent, that, specific duties are necessarily protective duties. Nothing can be - more faHnrious. Great Britain glories in free trade, and yet her whole revenue from imports is at the pres ent moment collected under a , system of specific duties. It is a striking fact in this connection, that in the commercial treaty of twenty-third January, J800, between France and England, one of the articles provides that the ad valorem duties which it imposes shall be couverted into specific duties within six mouths from its date, and these are to be ascertained by . making an average ot tne price tor six months pre vious to that time. - The reverse of the proposition would bo nearer to the truth because a much larger amount ot revenue would be collected by merely converting the ad valorem duties of a tariff into gen eral equivalent specific duties. To thi3 ex tent, the revenue would be increased, and in the same p-oportion, tho specific duty might be diminished. Specific duties would secure to the American manufacturer the incidental protection to which he is fairly entitled under a revenue tariff; and to this, surely no person would object. The framers of the existing tariff have gone further, and, in a liberal spirit, have discriminat ed in favor ot large and useful branches of our manufactures. Not by raising the rate of duties upon the importa tion of similar articles from abroad, but what is the same in effect, by admitting articles free of duty, which enter into the composition of their fabrics. Under the present system it has been often truly re marked that this incidental protection de creases when the manufacturer needs it most, and increases when he needs it least, and constitutes a sliding scale which always operates against him. The revenues of this country were subject to similar fluctuation, instead of approaching a steady standard, as : would be the case under a system of epeci lic duties. They sink and rise with the , sinking and rising prices of the articles in ; foreign countries. It vould not tie difficult ' for Congress to arrange a system of speci fic duties which would afford additional sta bility both to our revenue and our inanu ' facture?, without any injury or injustice to ' any interest of the country. This might be accomplished by ascertaining tho aver age value of any given article tor a seru.s of years at the place of exportation, and by simply converting the state of ad valorem duly upon it, which might be deemed nec essary for revenue purposes, into the form of a specific duty. Such an arrangement could not injure the consumer. If he should pay a greater amount of duty one year, thU would be counterbalanced by a lesser amount the next, r.nd in the end the aggre gate would lo the same. I desire to call your immediate attention to the present condition of the Treasury, so ably and clearly presented by the Secretary in his report to Congress, and to recommend that measures be promptly adopted to enable it to discharge its pressing obligations. The other recomtiK-ndation.s of the report are well worthy of your favorable consideration . UKI-OltIS OF DI-CAItTMICNrS. I herewith transmit to Congress the Re ports of the Secretaries of War, of the Navy, of the Interior, and of the Post Master Gen enil. The recommendations aud suggestions which they contain are highly valuable, and deserve your careful attention. The re port of the Post Master General details thtt circ'nmstances under which Cornelius Van ilerbilt, on my request, agreed, in the mouth of July last, to carry the Ocean wails be tween ottr Atlantic ami Pacific coasts. Had be not thus acted, this important intercom munication must have beeu susendad at least for a season. The Post Master Gener al had no lower to make him any other compensation than the postages on mail matter which he might carry. It was known at the time these postages would fall fur short of an adequate compensation, as well as of the sum which tho same service had previously cost tho Government . Mr. Vanderbilt, in a commendable spirit, waj willing to rely upon the justice of Congress to make up the deficiency, and I therefore recommend that an appropriation bi" granted for thi" purpose.
