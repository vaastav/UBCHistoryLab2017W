REED IS AGAIN SPEAKEK Other Officer of the Republican Caucus Are Elected -Tho Reed Rulea Are Adopted Largo Attendance at Organization of the Senate. Special to the Scranton Tribune. Washington. Dec. 2. It wa a notable audience In the presence of which Clerk Kerr converted the Fifty-fourth con gress at noon today. The events usual In opening of congress occurred, but the crowds present wcra much larger than the house officials counted on and many people were turned away. I'robably the most Indifferent person In the tu mult and excitement of the occasion was the man from Maine, who received the honor thrust upon him with calm demeanor. Heed was sworn In by Gen eral Hnemnr, w ho succeeds that other distinguished Philadelphlan, Hon. Charles O'N'ell, father of the house. Thla is Central Hasmer's twelfth con secutive term as representative and this was not overlooked today by his colleagues, who crowded about him to extend congratulations. In the drawing of seats all of the Pennsylvanlans in the house came early on the list and secured desirable placeB. Ex-Speuker Crisp did not receive the unanimous vote of the party. Repre sentative Cain, of Texas, still smarting from his chagrin of the Inst congress, which the refusal of Speaker Crisp to give him a committee appointment he sought engendered, bolted the candi date his party in caucus had nominated and cast his vote for Judge Turner of the Lone Star state. Much adverse criticism is being directed at Cain be cause of hl3 action. , Speculation as M Committees. Speaker Ree-d will not announce his committees for several days. He said today he had not campleted his list of committee appointment. When the committees are announced there will be some surprises. Reyburn. of Phila delphia, for Instance, who was on the committee on rivers and harbors in the last congress, will hardly be on the committee again although he wants the appointment. Congressmen Ache son and Helner. both from districts in the western end of the state, want to aret on the committee. Senator Quay has expressed a preference between tho two, and Acheson, whose district lies on the Mononprahela, which water way may be Improved, Is his choice. Reed may respect his wishes In the matter. Dalzell, of Pittsburg, Is still hoping against hone that Reed will make him chairman of ways and means. Nobody knows who is Reed's choice, but Reed and he wont tell. The chairman of comniittee on the Judiciary may be Colonel W, A. 6 tone, of Allegheny, and Hicks, of Altoona, wants to be chair man of the committee on public build ings and grounds. Pennsylvania will likely get the chairmanship of the com mittee on labor. Apsley, of Massachu setts, Is the ranking Republican mem br, but he said today he had other preferences, and with the Massachu setts man out of the way, Congress man Phillips, of the twenty-fifth dis trict, will be the ranking member. Phillips was most active as- member of the committee during the last congress. He is from an - Industrial section of the state, and is the best equipped man the house has for the place. There will be surprises in Keed's lists of comniit tee appointments. W. R, B. 

MACHINERY IN MOTION. The House Organized Without a Ripple of Olseord. Washington, Dec. 2. The machinery for the organization of the house of representatives worked today very sat isfactorily and without the slight est Jar. Mr. Reed, of Maine, in pur suance of the unanimous decision of the Republican caucus, was elected to the speakership by a vote of 234, as against 95 for Mr. Crisp, of Georgia, the Demo cratic candidate; 6 for Mr. Bell, of Colorado, the Populist candidate, and 1 for Mr. Culberson, of Texas, Democrat. The six votes for the Populist candidate were given by Messrs Baker, of Kan sas; Howard, of Alabama; Kem, of Ne braska, and Schuford, Rtanner and Stroud, of North Carolina. The one vote for Mr. Culberson was flven by his colleague, Mr. Crane this being the only deviation from party programmes. Mr. Reed's speech, in taking the chair, was brief and Incisive. He would not speak for the past, he said; the past could speak for itself. Nor should he speak for the future, as thpy were not putting off the harness, but putting it on. But he suggested that those who had acted with wisdom in the past might be fairly expected to act with wisdom in tho future. After the oath of office had been adminis tered to the speaker and all the mem bers, the next step irt the Republican programme, the election of the house officers, was taken, and Messrs. Mc Dowell, of Pennsylvania; Russell, of Missouri; Glenn, of New York; McEl roy, of Ohio, and Conden, of Michigan, were chosen as clerk, sergeant-at-arms, doorkeeper, postmaster and chaplain, respectively. The rules of the Fifty-first congress (popularly known as the Reed rules) were adopted for the government of the house in the present congress, after an assurance from Mr. Cannon (Republi can, lllnols), who had pffered the reso lution, that they would hereafter be re ferred to the committee on rules and that the house would nave an oppor tunity to discuss the report of the com mittee. That assurance seemed to sat isfy Mr. Crisp (Democrat, Oeorgla),who had raised the question, and the mat ter went through Without further con tention. After some further preliminary pro ceedings and a drawing for seats in the usual manner, perhaps somewhat In contravention of the anti-lottery law, and in which drawing many of the prizes fell to some of the least known of the members, and many of the blanks to some of the most distinguished, the house at I.3S p. m. adjourned until to morrow. Deiaoerstle Caucus.' Three hours) were consumed by the house Democrats In caucus this af ternoon, selecting? the four officials of their party, which they are entitled by their minority representation. The veteran OhloUtn, Colonel Isaac Hill, who was the deputy serjeant-at-arms of the last congress, was elected special employe over H. W. Moler, of Illinois, who held the office of cashier In the fifty-second congress. The of fice of special employe makes its pos sessor the legislative, "whip" of the minority, and Is worth 11,500 per year. After a long discussion, interspersed with numerous roll calls, George L. Browning, of Virginia, and Thomas Cokley, of (New Tork, were elected special messengers with salaries of $1,200 each. Mr. Cokley is a well-known member of the Tammany society and Is widely popular about the house. The caucus finished Its work by elect ing James F. English, of California, page. The Senoto OrsaniieJ. There was an unusually large attend ance of senators when the Fifty-fourth congress convened today, the only re corded absentees being Mr. Hill, of New Tork; Mr. Lindsay, of Kentucky; Mr. Wolcott, of Colorado, and two sen ators from Lousiana; Mr. Palmer, of Illinois, and Mr. Jones, of Arkansas, were absent during the first part of the proceedings, but came in in timo for adjournment. The only Interesting feature of the proceeding was the swearing in of the new senators. Be ing unofficially advised that the presi dent's message would not be delivered till noon tomorrow, the senate imme diately thereafter adjourned till that time. Will Movo to tho tVlilto House. Now that congress has assembled the president will move to the white house from his country home, "Woodley," where he wrote his annual message without disturbance. If tomorrow is a good day Mr. and Mrs. Cleveland and their children will take up their resi dence for the winter at the executive mansion. MUS. 

HOWELL'S TRIAL Important EvUlenco for the Common wealth in the Poisoning CaselsKultd Out by the Court. Wellsboro, Fa., Dec. 2. The trial of Mrs. Charlotte Howell, charged with poisoning Miss Elizabeth Knapp, was resumed this morning and tho counsel for both sides spent most of the day In citing authorities and urging the points to whether certain test letters printed by Mrs. Howell In the district attorney's office should be admitted as evidence or not. The commonwealth relied upon these test letters to prove that Mrs. Howell wrote all the threatening notes to Miss Knapp and the prosecuting at torneys claim that Mrs.Howell betrayed herself in consenting to print with a pencil In capital letters the phrases dic tated to her. She printed the letters so readily and so remarkably like the batch of original letters thut It makes a very strong point. The Judge held to his decision of Saturday and ruled out these letters. It has been shown by the testimony of Dr. H. H. Boom, an expert chemist of Philadelphia, that after an analysis he found three and three quarter grains of white arsenic in the stomach, bowels and liver of the dead girl. Tomorrow morning the taking of evi dence will be resumed and it will be several days before the prosecution completes its case, DEADLY SCISSORS WIELDED St. Louis Man Tiics as the Result of Ills W ife's Rage. St. Louis, Dec, 2. Andrew Hulen, aged 61, died at the city hospital last evening from erysipelas of the brain. Sunday he and his wife, Rachel, quar reled at their home, on North Twenty second street In her rage she picked up a pair of scissors and threw them at him. One of the points entered his right eyeball. Monday he was taken to the hospital Buffering Intense pain. His eyeball had been bo badly lacerat ed that the tissue protruded from tho wound. The face was badly inflamed and swollen. His serious condition prevented an operation, so soothing lotions were ap plied. Erysipelas set in, however, and attacked the brain. Hulen then became delirious, and never regained con sciousness. His wife Is now in Jail, charged with murder. riciiesHforrockford. Number of Residents Heirs to a $25,000, 000 titnto Long In Chancery.

PARDONS THEFT FOR BREAD Governor Matthews Explains Ills Appar ent Soft-llcurtednesa. Indianapolis, Dec. 2. "I woutd never pardon a man who stole for himself," said Governor Matthews today, "but when it can be shown that a man through misfortune Is brought face to face with want, and he steals In order that his wife and children shall, not go hungry, I will pardon him every time." ,Thls statement was brought out by recent criticisms of the governor's ac tion In granting pardons, it being said that he was too soft-hearted and parol ing too many prisoners. The governor answered his critics In the foregoing statement and added that he pardoned but three classes men drawn Into crime by accident, convicts known to be dying of disease and men whom he be lieved have been wrongfully convicted. JOE WALCOTT DEFEATED. The African Boxer Is Knocked Out by the "Ssglnaw Kid." Empire Athletlo Club, Maspeth, L. I., Dec. 2. The 15-round contest between Joe Walcott, Tom O'Rourke'a colored protege, and George Lavlgne, better known as the "Saginaw Kid," attracted, one of the largest crowds to the club that has been seen since the club was opened. '-. By a previous . arrangement between the. lads, the decision was to go to Lavlgne If he should be' on his feet at the end of fifteen rounds. The colored boxer, was favorite 'at 10 to on.

Information Regarding Armeni an Troubles Suppressed. Constantinople, Dec. 2. Contrary to the general impression tho powers seem to be unanimous In the resolve to insist upon their demand for extra guardshlps at the entrance to the Dardanelles. In discussing the temporary withdrawal or the British gunboat Dryad, a Turkish official Intimated that the matter was a very slmpleone.thesubstance of which was that the powers objected to any one power taking the lead In any action In Turkey, as such a step would be cal culated to give that power an outward advance In prestige, which was not part of the agreement of the powers. In other words, if action Is to be taken, it should be combined action upon the part of the powers, and not the Isolated action of Great Britain. Thus, It is in timated that If the passage of the Dar danelles la to be enforced, it should be done by the warships of all the powers interested. This was according to the original understanding. The alleged recent firing upon the British ship Loch Rannooh, In the Dar danelles, is said by the Turkish of ficials to be a matter of little Import ance and easily explained. They say that the Loch Kannoch arrived after sundown, and instead of anchoring, at tempted to proceed, and was signalled from the shore by a gunshot to bring up. As she did not do so, a Bccond shot was fired, and the Loch Rannoch let go her anchor. Tho shell which is said to have whizzed over the head of tho captain a pronounced to have been nothing more than the wad from tho signal gun ashcre. This Is the Turkish explanation of the matter, and is be lieved to be about correct. Concerning tlie EvSnltnn. A great deal of excitement was caused here today by the report that ex-Sultan Mohnmmed Murad, who was deposed on the ground of Idiocy on Aug. 31, 1ST6, only three months after he succeeded his deposed uncle, Abdul Aziz, had escaped from the Ylldiz Kiosk, where he was kept a close pris oner. The ex-Sultan, although a cap tive for nineteen years, Is said to enjoy good health and to have been Intriguing with the Young Turks party. As a re sult, his quarters are examined dally, sentinels are stationed at all the doors of his apartments, all his letters are read before being handed to him or posted, and at night the keys ,of his rooms are taken to the Sultan for safo keeping. He still wears a uniform, however, is addressed os "Your. Majes ty," and has a good table, a small libra ry, and a small hall converted Into a mosque, as part of his apartments. The report, it appears, grew out of the flight of Murad Bey, the Imperial commissioner of the council of the pub lic debt, who was also suspected of hav ing relations with the Young Turks party. Murad has been watched by the police for some time. He was suddenly summoned, to the palace to give an ex nlanation of his conduct, political and administrative. He went there In con- Biderable alarm, ana gave me uuuan what appeared to be a satisfactory ex planation of the charges brought against him, but, the matter being pressed further, his friends warned him that his life, a well as his liberty, was in danger. He therefore fled on board a Russian ship, and is now well on his way to Russia. Information Suppressed. From the provinces not much news Is forthcoming today. The Turkish offi cials are apparently doing everything possible to suppress any Information except that which is favorable to tho government. The utmost secrecy Is ob served regarding the movements of the Turkish troops operating from Marash or Zeltun, and as the latter place is now reported to be garrisoned by quite an army of Armenians.the complete silence as to what Is going on In that district causes much Interest and anxiety. If Armenian reports are to be belle-wed, the Turks will have to lay siege to iel tun before they will have any chance of capturing the town, which Is said to be well supplied with provisions and ammunition. On the other hand, the Turks claim to believe that the Arme nians will surrender at the appearance of the Sultan's troops. The Sultan Is Nervous. London, Dec. 2. The Standard's Vienna correspondent telegraphs that he learns from a trustworthy source In Constantinople that the Sultan Is In dally fear of sharing the fate of Ismail Pasha. His courtiers declare that the Powers have decided to depose him, us ing for this purpose, the forces aboard by the second guardshlps, which they demand shall be permitted to enter the Bosphorus. The Berlin correspondent of the Standard says that if It Is necessary the warship Hagen will be sent to Constantinople, the schoolshlp Moltke being ordered to continue her training cruise. NO BIG TARIFF CHANGES. Speaker Reed Opposed to Any Radical and Hasty Poller. Washington, Dec' J. As all legisla tion relating to revenue and tariff must originate in the house, ana as Speaker Reed will have control In a great meas ure of all Important legislation affect ing the government finances, his utter ances in accepting the speakership as to the duties of congress, are regarded as significant. If his counsels prevail, as they probably will, there will be little legislation excepting the finances and the tariff, or that will In any manner disturb or unsettle the business Inter ests at the coming seston. The leading Republican members wrio have talked with him on these subjects, and who rather favor some tariff legis lation, such as an Imposition of .a duty on wool and other articles, including agriculture, are in much doubt as to whether he approves of attempting any tariff 'legislation. . He has said to one and all who have talked with him that congress must wait and ascertain what President Cleveland and Secretary Car lisle have to say In taelr communications to congress. If It Is found that It will bo necessary, to raise mora revenue to meet existing and future - deficiencies the Republican leaders can then deter mine what line of policy shall be pur sued In order to raise the necessary rev enue. It 1j evident from what Speaker Reed has said that whatever is formulated relating to these questions will be based entirely, on Republican lines, and car ried out by the united action of the Re publican party.

SEX1T0K PALMER OBJECTS. Thinks tho Climax of Democratic Idiocy Would Be tho Nomination of tirover for a Third Term. Chicago, Doc. 2. "The Democratic party litis done many loollsh iIiI.iikh, no doubt, but In heaven's name let ua not Violate our most sacred tradition by nominating Cleveland for a third term." Bo said Benator John M. Palmer today.- He said: "I don't think he would ac cept, but whether he would or not, we should not think of nominating him again.

Vermillion, S. D., Dec. 2. Professor Todd of the State university of South Dakota, Is at work here upon a plan by which he expects to determine, by In vestigations in Wyoming. Montana and South Dakota, whether or not the arte sian water supply of thia state is inex haustible. He was the first geologist to make a comprehensive study of the artesian system of South Dakota, and the importance to the state of such a determination as he now proposes to reach, cannot be overestimated. He has outlined his plan in a general way to the director of the United States geological survey, but in cose the mat ter Is not taken up by the general gov ernment he will submit it to the next legislative resslon and ask the nld nnd support of the state in carrying out his project. DIED OF HYDROPHOBIA. Genuine Case of the Disease Is Reported from Shamokin. Shamokln, Fa., Dec. 2.--Oeorge Shoey. Jr., aged 30 years, died this morning from hydrophobia.

As the hours passed his ner vousness Increased and he paced the floor in agony of restlessness. 'His wife and two children did all they could to soothe him. but he grew worse. He complained that his flesh folt as though It was being pricked by needles. Tow ards midnight he began to bark, snap his teeth and froth at the mouth.

DYCIIE'S AMBITION. He Desires to Make Another Search for the North Pole. Kansas City, Mo Dec. 2. Prof. Dy che, of the Kansas University, said to day that he had practically decided to make another trip to the Arctic ocean In search of the pole, having received an offer of assistance, but he declines to name the source of the offer. It Is sup posed that American museum,1 under whose auspices he Joined the Peary ex pedition, has something to do with the offer, . The professor said the Insufficiency of the food supply has been the sole cause of the failure of previous expeditions and that given plenty to eat he will get to the North Pole as enslly as he Kot within 800 miles of It.

CONTROL THE SENATE Yesterday's Caucus Demonstrates the Republican Strength. SILVER SENATORS FAVORABLE There Seems No Question That Four of the Populist Senators Will Vote with Kcpubllcans on tho Reorgani zation of the Body. Washington, Dec. 2. The caucus held this afternoon by tho Republican sena tors, although devoid of positive action, demonstrated the fact that probably a successful attempt will soon be made to reorganize the senate In both com mit tes and elective ofllcers. The sena tors were pot in snusion moro than half an hour, but during that brief period there was a ueneral clearing of tho at mosphere, which had been somewhat obscured by the action of a few senators who met Saturday nlftht for the pur pose of preparing a plan of action that should result In takltis th" mnnnpo nicnt of tho senate out of tho hands of the older members. Tiie result of this afternoon's talk Is ix reconciliation of conflicting ele ments and the establishment of n sin cere desire on the part of nil those pres ent to do that which Is for tho best Interest of the whole party. Senator Frye was surjw steil as pres ident pro tern, nnd no otlier name wan mentioned. He will bo nominated, but it was deemed useless to do anything in the matter today for the reason that no president pro tern, enn be elected so long os the vice president fills the chair. If the Republicans can show the Democrats that they have enough votes to elect the president pro tern, the selection will be held. :t Is understood that Mr. Sherman is to consult with the opposition caucus rhalrmun and ar range for a timo for this vote to bo taken. If. by that time the Republi cans have agreed upon a candidate for the other offices, the whole ticket will be placed In the field. Populist Support Certain. Of course In order to organize the sen ate the Republicans must have two votes outside of those In their own ranks mid Senators Stewart nnd Junes, of Nevada, are generally locked upon r.s the men who will vote with the Re publicans on organization. It was point ed out that tho silver men were en deavoring to secure an organisation on monetary lineB; that the Populists were considering a ticket and that tlie Demo crats were not prepared to surrender their control. The silver Republicans and Democrats thl3 morning Informed the PopuliBls thnt they could not Join in any effort to organize on silver llnes.and as soon asthel'opulists.whoarethemuln advocates of the plan, are convinced they cannot be successful, it 1st claimed that they will divide, according to their predilections for tho two great parties Messrs.AiJen und Kyle with tlie Demo crats, and Mesrs. Jones, Stewart, But ler nnd Peffer with the Republicans. The Republicans need two out of these four votes. The Republicans say that all differences will be removed and that when they place a ticket In the field It will have tho necessary majority. It Is hardly probable, however, that this re organization will be effected before the holidays.
