After Many Years Litigation Ths United Slates Must Purchasa the Properly From the Lee Heirs Or Acquire Title by Condemnation Other Supreme Court Cases- A decision was rendered by tho Supremo Court of the United Slates Monday in tho caso of Frederick Kaufman and Richard P Strong plaintiffs in error against Goorgo W P C Leo in error to tho circuit court of tho United States for tho eastern district of Virginia This was a suit brought by Gen Leo to I cover possession of a tract of cloven hundred acres of land in Alexandria County va known as tho Arlington Estate which was sold for taxes under tho act of Congress of Juno 7 18G2 and purchaged by tho United States for tho sum of 28GOO Tho amount of tho unpaid tax was 9207 Tho plaintiffs in error against whom tho suit was brought woro Frederick Kaufman super intendent of tho Arlington National Cem etery and Capt R P Strong U S A commanding otllcer at Fort Whlnnlo Theso officers held possession in tho name of tho United States of a largo part of tho proporty in controversy Upon tho trial in tho court ueiow Attoruoyiuenoral uevons appeared in behalf of tho United States and moved that tho suit bo dismissed for tho reason that tho government as a sovorcign power could not o constitutionally sued in its own courts without its own consent and such consent in this caso had novcr bocn given To this sug gestion and motion counsel for Gen Leo de murred and tho demurrer was sustained Tho case was then tried upon its merits Counsel for tho defendants maintained that tho prop erty had been duly Bold for taxes under tho act of Congress of Juno 71862 that tho United States had bought it and that their title was valid Counsel for Gen Lee on tho othor hand admitted that tho taxes had not boon paid but declared that tho salo was invalid for tho reason that tho tax commissioners had adopted a general rulo not to receive taxes except from tho owner of tho property in person and that this practically mado it impbssiblo for Gen Leo who was then in tho Confederate service to pay his taxes within tho timo designated Tho Court instructed thojury that if they believed from tho ovldcnco that tho commissioners had adopted and uniformly acted upon such a rule as that referred to tho salo was unauthorized and conferrred no title upon tho purchasers Under this instruction tho jury found a verdict in favor of Gen Lee and judgment was entered accordingly Two appeals wero taken lrom this judg ment ono In tho namo of Kaufman and Strong tho nominal defendants and ono in tho name of tho United States The most important question presented hero is the ques tion of jurisdiction or in other words the question whether suit can be brought under any circumstances against tho government of tho Unltod States without that governments consent unis court in a long ana careiuuy nrenared oninlon hv Mr JiiRtlnAMUlnr hnlrla First that the United States cannot bo sued as a party acienuans in any court wnamvor except whero Congress has provided for such suit second that this exemption is howorer limited to suit against tho Unltod States di rectly and by name and cannot bo success fully pleaded in favor of ofilcors and agents of tho United States when sued by privato persons for property in their possession as such officers and agents third that in such cases a court of competent jurisdiction over tho parties beforo tlio it may inquire into tno lawluincss ot tno possession of tho United States as held by such officers or ngents and give judgment according to the result of tho inquiry fourth that tho dif ference in tho essential features of monarchi cal and a republican form of government ren ders tho decisions of tho English courts on this subject of but little value whllo numerous de cisions of this court from its organization to tho presont day establish tho foregoing propo sition fifth that the constitutional provision that no person shall bo deprived of life lib erty or property without duo process of law nor private property taken for public uso without just compensation aro intended as limitation of tho power of tho government In its dealing with tho citizen and relato to that class of rights whoso protection is peculiarly thoprovlnce of tho judicial branch of tho gov ernment sixth that in regard to tho life and liberty of tho citizen the courts havo so often exorcised tho power by writ of habeas corpus that thcro remains no question about their rlfirbt to do so and thnttbev aro eanallvbound to afford a remedy for unlawful invasions of rights of property by officers of any branch of tho government seventh that tho evils which it is suggested may nriso from interference of Btato or other courts wittt tno oxerclso of powers essential to government aro illu sory and aro insignificant in comparison with tho proposition that no relief can bo granted when it is asserted that tho United States has authorized the wrong eighth that such suits if commenced olso whero aro by existing laws always remov able into u court of tho United States in which injustice to tho government will neither bo presumed nor pomvitted ninth on tho trial of tho present caso before tho jury tho tttlo relied on by tho defendants was a certificate of sale of tho land to tho United States by tho commissioners under the act of Congress for tho collection of direct taxes and the certifi cate was impeached becauso of tho Tcfusal of tho Commissioners to ncrmit tho owner to nav tho tax by an agent or in any other way than in person The principles laid down in tho cases of Burnett vs Hunter 0 Wall 324 Tracy vs Irwin 18 Wall 510 and Atwood vs Wecms 89 U S 183 applies to a pur chaso by tho United 8tatcs as well as by a privato person namely that when tho com missioners establish a uniform rulo that tboy will rcccivo such taxes from no ouo but tho owner in person it avoids tho Kilo and a tender of tho amount of the tax is unneces sary since it would bo of no avail Speaking of tho rights of individuals as against tho government Justice Miller says What is the right of the defendant in error as established bv tho verdict nf tho Jury in this case It is the right to the possession of his homestead a right to recover that which has been taken from him by fores and vio lence and detained by tho strong hand This right being clearly established wo aro told that the court can proceed no further because It appears that certain military officers acting under orders of tho President havo seized this cstnto and converted ono part of it into a military fort and another Into a cemetery It Is not pretended us tho caso now stands that tho President had any lawful authority to do this or that tho legislative body could give him any such authority except upon puyment of Just compensation Tho defense stundshcro solely upon tho absolute immunity from Ju dicial Inquiry of overy ono who assorts au thority from tho executive branch of tho gov ernment however clear It may bo mado that tho executive possesses no such power aud not only that no such power is given but that it is absolutely prohibited both to tho ex ecutive nnd tho legislative to deprlvo any ono of life liberty or property without duo process of law or to tako private property without Just compensation Theso provisions for tho security of tho rights of the citizen Btand in tho Constitution in tho same connection and upon tho same ground as they regard his lib erty and his property It cannot bo denied that both were intended to bo enforced by the Judiciary as ono of tho departments of the government cstahiisncil by tlio Constitution crtyof the citizen nnd oven his life against the assertion of unlawful uuthorlty on tho part of tho cxecutlvu or the legislative branch of the government Nouum in this country is so high that ho Is nbovo the law No officer of tho law mnv set that law at dofiancowlth Impunity All tho officers of tho government from tho high est to tho lowest aro crcatures of tho law and nro bound to obey it It is tho only supremo power In our system of government nnd overy man who by accepting ofilco partici pates in itsfuuctlons is only tlio moro strongly bouud to submit to that supremacy and to observe tho limitations which It imposes upon tho oxorciso of tho authority which it gives Courts of Justlco aro established not only to dcciiUupon tho controverted rights of the citlzous as against each other but also upon rights In controversy between them and tliu government aud tho docket of this court is crowdod with contro versies of tho latter class Shall It bo said In tho faco bf nil this and of tho acknowledged rights of iho Judiciary to decido In proper cases statutes which havo been passed by both branched of Congress nnd approved by tho President to bo unconstitutional that tho courts cannot glvo a remedy when tho citizen has been denrlvcil of his nronortv bv force his estato seized and converted to tho use of tho government without any compensation becauso the President has ordered it and his officers in possession If such bo tho law of this country It sanctions a tyranny which has no cxlstcnco in tho monarchies of Europe nor in any other government which has a just claim to well regulated liberty nnd tho protection of personal rights In conclusion Justlco Miller says that tho circuit court was competent to decido tho issues In this case between tho parties that wero beforo it that In tho principles on which IH030 issues wero decided no error has been found and that tho Judgment Is affirmed Justlco Gray read n long dissenting opinion which was concurred In by
