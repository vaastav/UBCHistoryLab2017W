USE AUTO LICENSE MONEY TO BUILD ROADS With nearly thirty-five thou sand automobile licenses issued In the state within the first five months of the fiscal year, and probably another ten thousand will be issued before the year is out, June 30, 1917, is it not per tinent to ask the question what becomes of this money the state gathers in from this new source. Let us figure that the average cost of a license is six dollars and a half, that will make on the thirty five thousand licenses a sum of nearly a quarter of a million dollars. What is done with it? Does it go to the general fund of the state, and if so, why? The logical and proper dispo sition of this money is upon the highways of the state, the better ment of the roads, and, thus re turn to the original owners of the money, improved highways. Let us suppose that a license tax of .$10.00 per car was the state tax on automobiles, which, with a conservative estimate of 45,000 cars in the state, would bring in $450,000, and, let the legislature, which meets soon in Raleigh, pass a law that this money is to be used exclusively for road improvement, is it likely that there will be a sin gle objection to the tax? Every owner of a car would cheerfully contribute his quota when he knows that the money would go to the improvement of the roads that he daily uses, and often complains about. The plan would have to be worked out scientifically, of course, but it would seem that a bill could be prepared for presen tation to the next assembly along these lines. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE President Wilson's message, de livered at the re-convening of Con gress, Tuesday, will be found in full on the front page of this is sue. - Businesslike almost to the point of abruptness the message reads of things to be accomplished which Congress, in view of the se rious conditions, dare not evade. First and foremost is the trou ble between the railroad magnates and the union representing the men, and while the tenor of the president's remarks are along the lines of regulation, compelling obedience to the law by the rail roads, it was evident also that the union would also be placed under supervision, if the chief executive has his way. The elimination of the possibil ity of strikes tying up the coun try, by the mere say-so of some union executives, is a crying need of the country, a tthe same time the men should be properly pro tected, and, they will if the pow ers of the Interstate Commerce Commission are extended as de sired. The recommendation to broad en the laws governing Porto Rico brought forth an immediate pro test from the suffragists, for when the president read the words "The present laws governing the island and regulating the rights and pri vileges of its people are not just" the women unfurled the silken banner of suffrage yellow, upon which was enscribed in black let ters the inscription, "Mr. Presi dent, what will you do for woman suffrage?", which fluttered down upon the heads of Senators and Representatives. The president smiled and turn ed back to his manuscript and continued his address. Another recommendation is for the passage of a bill to regulate the expenditure of money in elec tions, commonly known as the Corrupt Practice Act, which the president wishes extended. . Another important recommen dation is the extension of freedom to those engaged in promoting the foreign commerce of the coun try, that is now thought by some not to be legal under the terms of the law against monopoly. After the president retired the members discussed the message in formally, and it was the general opinion that congress will enact into law what the president has asked for, but it also was the opin ion of many that there was a pos sible bitter clash with labor dur ing the early part of next year. So well was the president's mes sage received that the republicans joined with democrats in cheering Mr. Wilson. 

SCHOOL CONSOLIDATION The matter of general education in this country has reached a point where more serious consideration will have to be given the question of fural schools. Of one fact there can be no question, our country has reach ed a period in its history when its people must be given education. Ignorance and illiteracy are no longer compatible with twentieth century life. Every person familiar with conditions under which the coun try schools are maintained, knows that under these conditions it is absurd to even hope that a child may obtain a competent education therein. With a school house to every two or three miles of terri tory, dividing up the attendance and multiplying the number of teachers, two unavoidable conse quences result terms are shorten ed and inferior teachers are em ployed. It is a fact, patent to all intelli gent observers, that to attain to any proficiency in teaching, the person must choose this as his or her life work, and must labor to equip themselves for efficient ser vice. To this end there must be sufficient inducement. The utter absurdity of a three of four months term at $25 or $30 per month furnishing that inducement is plain to all. One of the greatest possible de triments to the proper education of a child is an incompetent teach er, and that the conditions just de scribed are fast flooding the land with a lot of incompetents is plain to all. And the child is the suf ferer. Where he should be right ly and thoroughly grounded in all the different branches, in realitv he frequently has but an imperfect and sometimes even a wrong ground mark to build on, the re sults of which are seen in the woe fully inefficient lives of so many of our people. Again, it is too plain even for argument, that no community can educate its children on three and four months terms of school. Prac tically the entire accumulations of the short term are forgotten dur ing the long vacation. There are, then, two indisputa ble requisites to the proper edu cation of our rural population competent instructors and school terms sufficiently long. Of courw, in the densely populated districts schools can be maintained of suf ficient size to guarantee the length of the term, as this depends almost entirely on the per capita, and giv en the term, with an adequate sal ary, the competent teacher is eas ily secured and the children's best interests conserved. But in the sparsely settled dis tricts this is not the case and here arises the imperative need of con solidationreducing the number of schools, thereby increasing the funds available for each, thus in suring the desired results of a longer term and more competent teacher. As to just how consolidation may best be accomplished, must be left almost entirely to local con ditions to determine. The public conveyance plan is working well in many sections. The develop ment of good roads is also having a beneficial effect and aiding in the solution. But as we stated, this is entirely a local question and must be worked out locally. The important point is that the people be brought to see the abso- Next Wednesday Night A BIG VITAGRAPH BLUE RIBBON FEATURE "The Great Divide" FEATURING ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED AC TORS IN THE WORLD HOUSE PETERS THIS PICTURE SHOWS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL NATURAL SCENERY. . 99 THURSDAY 12 th Episode "Iron Claw5 - FRIDAY 7th Episode "Secret of Submarine" SATURDAY Big Western Feature Picture The Palace The Finest Compliment You Can Pay Any Person Is to Send Them a Gift From This Old Store For over half a century our reputation for selling quality gifts has won for us the approval of gift buyers in many states.
