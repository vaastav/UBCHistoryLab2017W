Se?ale ?i?di-House Ol Repres entatives : As a nation we still continue to en joy a literally unprecedented prosper ity; and it is probable that only reck less speculation and .disregard .of ligi timate business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. No Congress in' our time has done more good work of importance than the present Congress: There were' several matters left unfinished at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will com plete before your adjournment. Corporation Campaign Contributions. I ?g?iii r?cbmlfi?ild .ft law prohib iting ali corporations' from contribut ing to the campaign. expenses of any party. Such' a bill has already past one House of Congress. Let individ uals contribute as they desire; but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making contribu tions for any political purpose di rectly or indirectly. Government's Eight to Appeal In Cfimin?l Cases. Another bili which has past one House of the Congtess .which it is urgently necessary should be enacted into law is that conferring upon thc Government the Hglit bf appeal in criminal cases oii Questions of law. This right exists in many of the States; it exists in the District of Columbia by act of the Congress. It is. of course not proposed that in any case a verdict for the defendaut on the merits should be set aside. Re cently in one district where the Gov ernment had indicted certain persons for conspiracy'in connection, with re bates, the court ?ustaiued the defen dant's demurrer; while in another an indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions obtained uuder it and' two defendants sentenced to im prisonment. The two cases referred in real conflict with such a conflict, when it occurs, to bc solved by an appeal to a higher court and the wheels of justice are blocked without any real decision of the ques tion. I eau not too strongly urg.. the passage of the bill in question. Setting Aside of Judgments and Granting of New Trials. In connection with this matter, I would like to call attention to the very unsatisfactory state of our crim inal law, resulting in large part from the habit of setting aside the judg ments of inferior courts on technical ities absolutely unconnected with th<j merits of the case, and where there is no attempt to show that there has been any failure of substantial jus tice. It would be well to enact a law providing something to the effecr that: No judgmeut shall be set aside by new trial granted in any case, civil or criminal, or. the ground of misdi rection of the jury or the improper admission or rejection of evidence, or for .error as to any matter of plead ing or procedure unless, in the opin ion of the court to which the appli cation is made, after an examina tion of the entire cause, it shall affir matively appear that the error com plained of has resulted in a miscar riage of justice. Injunctions. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection witl. the. issuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the matter by the demand that the right of applying injunctions in labor case* should bc wholly abolished. It is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the usc of injunction? in such eases would stand the test of the courts: in" which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Lynching. In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the attention of the nation to the prev alence of crime among us, and above all to the epidemic of lynching- and mob violence that springs up, now ii: one part of our country, now in an other. Each section, North, South, East and West, has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend its time jeering at the faults of another section; it should be busy trying to amend its own shortcomings. To deal with thc crime of corruption it is necessary tu have an awakened public conscience, and to supplement this by whatever legislation will add speed and certainty in the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more is necessary. A great 'man3- white men arc lynched, but the crime is peculiarly frequent in respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching is the per petration, especially by black men. of the hideous crime of rape-^the most aboninable in . all-, the category of crimes, even worte than murder. Mobs frequently avenge tbe commis sion' of this crime by themselves tor turing to death the man committing it; thus avenging iii bestile fashion a bestile deed, and reducing themselves to a level with the criminal.

I Corporations. ? The present Congress has taken lrng strides in the direction of secur ing proper supervision and control by the National Government ovei corporations engaged in interstate business-and the enormous majority of corporations of any size are engag ed in interstate business. The ? pas sage of the railway rate bill, and only to a less degree the passage of the pure food bill, and thc provision for increasing and rendering more effec tive national control over the beef packing industry, mark an important advace in the proper direction. In the short session it will perhaps be difficult to do much further along-thu line; and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to increase their scope, because only operations will show with exactness their merits and their shortcomings and thus give opportunity to define what further remidial (legislation is needed. Yet in my judgment it will in the end be advisable in connection with the packing house inspection law to provide for putting a date on tba label and for the packers. All these laws have already jutified their en actment. Agriculture. The only other persons whose wel fare is as vital to the welfare of the whole country as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of the soil, the farmers, lt is a mere trusim .to say that no growth of cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial de velopment can atone for any falling off in the character and standing of the fanning population. During the last few decades this fact has been recognized with ever-increasing clear ness. Marriage and Divorce. I am well aware of how difficult it 's to pass a constitutional ameudment. Nevertheless in my judgment the whole question of marriage and di vorce should be relegated to. the au thority of the National Congress;. Al present the wide difference in the Jaws of the different States on thia subject result in scandals and abuses; and surely there is nothing so vitallv essential to tho welfare of the nation, nothing around which the nation should so bend itself to throw every safeguard, as the home life of the average citizen.

American Shipping. Let me once again' call the atten tion Of the Congress to two subjects co?e'enrirtg which I have frequently before c?fflffl??iea't?? With them.

In the matter of rifle prac tice the President says :. The Congress has most wisely pro vided for a National Board for the promotion of rifle practice. Excellent insults ?ave -already come from this law,- biit it ?od? not go far enough. Our Regular Army is ?? Small that in ihf great war -we should have to irust m?irjty io volunteers; and in such event these "volunteers should already know how to shoot ; for if a tfoldjer has the fighting edge, and ability ro take care of himself in the open his.efficiency Ofi tlJ? line of bnt 'tle is almost directly proportionate to excellence in mnrkmanship.
