CONGRESS IS AT IT ACAIN President Opposes Large Army.— Mexican Situation. Congress convened December 7. One of the first matters brought up prominently for consideration, is the proposed investigation of this nation's preparedness for war. President Wilson is said to favor full Inquiry Into tbe military conditions by con gressional committees, but opposes a national securitv board as untimely. Various senators and representatives oiler suggestions for enlarging the navy as well as the army. In his message, President Wilson strikes against the agitation for a large army. He says tbe national defense Is not neglected. Tbe presi dent also seeks to reassure the busi ness Interests, saying prosperity Is near, and he urges that the govern ment provide ships to carry American goods to the foreign markets. A disordered condition still exists In Mexico. Provisional President Gulterrez Is said to have occupied the capital last Sunday, supported by the troops of Zapata and Villa. The United States is holding $ 1 , 000.000 In gold, customs money collected at Vera Cruz during the American occupation, and will not turn it over until a stable government Is estab lished in Mexico. Factions under various opposing leaders are fighting in various sections of the country and close to the American border. On Dec. 8 Presi dent Wilson directed Secretary of War Garrison to order sufficient troops to Naco, Anz , to handle any emergencies that might arise there in connection with tbe firing across the American border from Mexican terri tory. 

ATLANTIC OCEAN RECORDS. VssmIs That Won Farn« by Reducing the Time of the Trips. In tbe early days of Atlantic steam navigation anywhere from ten days to a fortnight was used up between New York and England, and on the east ward voyage it was by no means un usual for some of tbe sailing packets of Grlnnell and Mluturu, red, white and blue swallowtail burgee, and of Tommy Tapscott, black ball on burgee and foretopsail, to beat tbe lumbering sldewbeelers. Tbe first steamer to cut under tbe ten day voyage was tbe Persia in 1856. with 0 days, 1 hour and 45 minutes This remained a record for ten years, until tbe Scotia In 1860, 8 days, 2 hours and 48 minutes, lopped off a whole day. Three years later tbe City of Brussels In 1809 established the seven day class, with 7 days, 22 hours and 3 minutes. It was not until 1882 tbat tbe six day boat claimed the record, tbe Alaska, with 0 days, 18 hours and 87 minutes. The five day class was opened ln 1889 by the City of Paris, with 6 days 19 hours 18 minutes. Tbe first of the four day class was tbe Lusitania ln 1908, with 4 days 15 hours. Tbe rec ord Is now held by tbe Mauretania, with a passage in 1910 of 4 days, 10 hours and 21 minutes.—New York Sun. British Coronation.

The series of battles between the Germans and Russians between the rivers Warta and Vistula for the possession of the city of Lodz, resulted in success for the Ger mans, who entered the place Sun day, Dec. 6 . The shelling of the city began a week before and the German troops were very aggres sive in their attacks for three days prior to the retreat of the Russians who could no longer withstand the assaults made upon them. Lodz is the second city, and the chief manufacturing center in Russian Poland, and has over 400,000 population. The Russians report that the numerous mills and factories have been closed a long time and the inhabitants out of employment and short of food are in a pitiable condition. The Ger man shells started numerous fires throughout the city. The Germans have control of all the railroads in the triangle be tween Thorn and Kalisz and Lowicz and use them for bringing up troops and supplies. It is said the Kaiser's troops are now in a position to entrench and hold a position from which they can menace the Russian communica tions with Warsaw, the capital of Poland, which is their objective. to of is of be cided to enter the war on the side j of the allies but may not begin her I 1 Rumania is reported having de campaign until winter is over.

GRANDEUR IN GLACIERS. The Alpine-like Seenery In Mount Rai nier National Park. Mount Rainier National park Is sit uated tn western Washington, shoot fifty-six miles southeast of tbe city of Tacouia. It has an area of 207300 acres and comprises Mount Rainier and all Its approaches, Including on# of the largest glacier systems In the world radiating from any single peak. Surrounding the mountain are beau tiful forests of Or and cedar, and In the natural parka below tbe snow line are luxuriant fields of wild flowers of sU colors and descriptions. The low«: al titudes of tbe park are densely tim bered with fir, cedar, hemlock, maple, alder, cottonwood and spruce. The forested areas, extending to an alti tude of about 0,500 feet, gradually de crease In density of growth after an altitude of 4,000 feet la reached, and tbe high, broad plateaus between tbe glacial canyons present incomparable ecenes of diversified beantles, seeming ly arranged to suit every taste. These "parks," as they are called, are studded here and there with lakes and streams bordered with clumps of pic turesque Alpine firs and gorgeous beds of wild flowers, and in numerous In stances apparently tender blossoms will be found pushing their heads out from under tbe snow. The general elevation of the glacial valleys at tbe boundary lines of the park Is about 2,000 feet above sea level. These valleys afford a comparatively easy grade to the lower ends, or "snouts," of the various glaciers, ap proximately an average additional ele vation of 2,000 feet At these glacier snouts tbe real Alpine nature of Mount Rainier National pork territory Is thrust upon the traveler, and from, over, around and alongside the glaciers trulls have been constructed with a view to making tbe wonders of nature within the park easily accessible as well ns to provide patrol routes for tbe protection of the forests and game.
