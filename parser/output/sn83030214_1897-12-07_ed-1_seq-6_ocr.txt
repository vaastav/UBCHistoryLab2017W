Constrained hy a high sense of duty to avoid delaying public business, tbe President returned from Canton to Washington in order that bla Message might be presented to Congress yes? terday lu tbe customary manner. He ts already on his way back to hla mother's bedside, and the universal hope Is that he may fiud her still alive and able to derive comfort from his de? votion. It is not a mere commonplace of respect for the Chief Magistrate to say that President Mc? Kinley'? Message Is admirable In form and subsi?uice. He Is never under the necessity In his public utterances of endeavoring to com? mand attention by laborious attempts at a style of solemn majesty. He Invariably says what he has to say In simple, vigorous English, but he hns the happy faculty of imparting Interest to bis expression of Ideas by his manner of expressing them. Long practice In his case has presumably made writing easy, but what he writes is far from beiug hard reading. The Importance of tbe subjects which he discusses would have attracted wide attention to the Message however it had been composed, but It has the conspicuous merit of facilitating a clear comprehension of Its contents. After an approving reference to the tariff law as a great transaction wisely completed at the extra ses? sion, the President passes at once to a lucid discussion of the currency question, and pro? poses that simple measure for the security of the Treasury of which he had already per? mitted the country to obtain an accurate fore? cast. His recommendation, which we have heretofore described and heartily advocated, Is that, when the receipts of the Government shall have become sufficient to pay all the expenses of the Government. United States notes having been redeemed In gold sh<ill be set and kept apart, and reissued only In ex.hange for gold. The President defines the adoption of that pol? icy not merely as a reasonable privilege, but as an obvious duty, and he puts the case with great logical force ns follows: If the holder of the I'nlted States note prefers the gold, and gets it from the Government, h? should not receive back from the Government a United States not? without paying gold In ex charge for it. The reason to-: this Is made ail the more apparent when th? Government Issues an interest-bearing debt to provide gold for the redemption of United States notes?a non-lnter est-bearlng debt. Surely It should not pay thetn out again except on demand and for gold. If they are put out In any other way. they may re? turn again, to h? followed'by another bond l^sue to redeem them?another Interest-bearing debt to redeem a non-lnterest-bearlng debt. In my view lt Is of the utmost Importance that the Government should be relieved from the burden of providing all the gold reciulred for exchanges and export. This responsibility is alone borne by the Government without any of the usual and necessary banklns; powers to help Itself. The banks do not feel the strain of gold re? demption. The wh de strain rests upon tho Government, and the size of the gold reserve In the Treasury has cime to be, with or without reason, the signal of danger or of security. This ought to be stopped We do not need to urge our readers to give this part of the Message the careful attention which It deservet. nor will any intelligent chi? ten, whatever his political ?nd ticanclnl oplu toas may be, f.".Il t<? observe the courteous tone In which the President frankly avows convic? tion* which he Is nware that ? considerable part of Congress and of the country have not hither to shared. On this and other controversial topics the Magejejge Is remarkable alike for the firmness and tho suavity of its utterance?. To the President's discussion of foreign rela? tions, and especially of the Cuban situation, we refer at length in another artici?'. It perfectly illustrates in every senten.ee his broad and ac enrats compr?hension of National and interna? tional ohii!*:ilions, the sotiriety of his judgment and his Ingenuous courage. Of other questions of l?-ss momentous signlflennop he brings the substance to public knowledge and attention, wi?ely referring the people and their repre? sentatives to tho elaborate reports of his advisers for ?lei?ii!?'d information, but not omit? ting to give definite ?pression to his own views and expectations concerning any impor? tant mailer. Thus, on the subjects of Ha? waiian annexation, the sealing controversy. In? ternational bimetallism, reciprocity negotiations, arbitration and the Indians, the President briefly acquaints 'lie country with the latest fa?cts and accompanies them with a forecast of th? results #hlch he anticipates. It Is pe culiarly gratifying at a time when the improv? ing condition of affairs Is fltlll susceptible to adverse influences, however slight, that he Is able to fake a thoroughly sanguine view of the n?>ar future. The most devoted friends of good government, and Republicans in particular, by whom th" elevation of the Clv'.l Service bas been faithfully promoted, will nmo with .pleas? ure the President's pledge to promote that proc? ess by all the means In his power. The Message closes with an earnest recom? mendation of economy on the part of Congress, to the end that the expenditures may be kept within the receipts Of the Government. The country will not ox?*cpt this admonition in ap? proving a Message of extraordinary Interesi and excellence. 

FORE! OX RE FATI OX S. T?o must be a poor American who Is not pleased with the President's utterances concern? ing Cuba. The simple record of the achieve nients of the Administration in the last nine months, as modestly rehearsed, Is ample to sat? isfy the most zealous upholder of American rights and honor. There ?rere more than ? scoro of American citizens In Cuban Jails, some of them under sentence of death. Today, a: the demand of this Government every one is at liberty. Spain refused to consider any medi atlon or representations by this Government looking to cessation of hostilities. Now she ''appreciates the friendly purposes of this Gov? ernment" and "admits that our country is deep? ly affected by the war In Cuba, and tha 11? "desires for pope- arc Just." Tims?? two fa :ta Indicate s success of Amor'.e?n diplomacy In dealing with Spain quite with >Ul prec dent lu the long history of <'uban troubles. To what extent the United Suites has Influenced thi Spanish Government In its radical change of attitude toward Cuba is not even to be specu? lated upon The fHcts of record are these: Nine months n-.-o Spain d>-<!.'irod that the only way to pacify < ?iba was to reduce tii?? Insur? gents to submission, and it was trying ??> d > the latter by means of what the Pr??- leni 

JUBI |y describes as not civilized warfare but ei termination. ?\gainst that eiuel policy the United States Gorernmeet firmi., ind earnestly protested. To-day Spain has "recalled the coin "mander, whose brutal orders Inflamed the "American mind snd shock* d thi cl illzed "world she ims modified the horrible order "of concentration." And, in a good faith above all question, she offers to Cuna a sehen reforms and self-government comparable wl :. the most liberal ever made by a parent ci-un try to a colony. In this immeasurably amoliorpfod state of af? fairs, what is the further duty ef this Nation' Oa this point the Pr?sident Is troubled with no doubts, nor should any one bo who thought? fully reads his convincing discussion of it. ForChle annexation would bo a crime, II.? does not consider it. Recorjnitlon of lnloj.cn d'-nco or of belligerency would bo inadvisable, largely for the veiy same reason? which tw.-n ty-two years ?go constrained this Government to withhold such action. The extended quotation from President Grant's Message of I.>mber 187.S, which tho President mak'-s. !?? entirely a;it to the existing situation. Recognition, and the Consequent exorcise of the rir-ht of search on the seas and seizure of goods contraband <?' war would be onerous and embarrassing to this country, and, while, theoretically serving both the belligerents alike, would practically, for ob vious reasons, operate heavily to the advantage of Spain. N?r does the President regard more favorably the suggestion of Intervention upon humanitarian grounds Whatever provocation to such a course there might have boi?n In the dark days of Woylorism, there can be little now, since Spain has entered upon a human ? and ?lenient policy. On the contrary, it is, as the President well says, honestly due to Spain that she should have ? reason,il ile opportunity In which to realize her expectations and to vin? dicate the efficacy of the new order of things to which ehe stands Irrevocably committed. That does not mean that this country Is to a? quiesce In an indefinite prolongation of the struggle, nor that this Government Is to relax In the least Its watchful solicitude for American luterests at the scene of strife. What the pr?s ent Administration has already accomplished In respect to Cuba Is ample guarantee of Its faith? fulness and efficiency In future, no matter what Issues may arise While thus adopting a con? ciliatory and expectant policy, the President does not hesilato to speak with the utmost en? ergy In vindication of American rights and good faith. The charge of failure to prevent filibus terlug he denies with unequivocal emphasis. That this Government has, by constant watch? fulness and at the cost of millions of dollars, prevented the departure of a single expedition or armed vessel from thees shores is a sufficient answer to the complaints of Spain. Other foreign topics are of less Importance, and receive less attention In the Message, though they aro all treated in a Straightforward and convincing manner. Ratification of the Ha? waiian annexation treaty Is urged, on grounds of fitness, right and Justice, and not of mere expediency, and assurance Is given that friendly relations with Japan will not be jeoparded thereby. The sealing controversy with Croat Britain Is still unsettled, and the President Is perforce content to report that negotiations are In progress. An earnest word is spoken In be? half of International arbitration, and a liberal policy for the promotion of American repre? sentation at the Paris World's Fair of 11k? Is urged. With these and a few minor topics briefly considered, the foreign relations of the country are dismissed. That no routine rolleaii of the nations of the globe Is made, according to the stereotyped formula, Is not to be eon strued Into neglecifulness of American Inter eats or unwillingness to lay complete stale ments of affairs before Congress and (he people. It merely means, no doubt, that In nn emlmntly practical and businesslike manner the President has chosen to devote his Message to thorough presentments of topics of general and com? manding Interest, leaving the rest for the In? quiry of those whom It may concern, in this he will win the gratitude of a people too often wearied with prolix and perfunctory chronicl? s of small beer. His treatment of the sal.eiit themes which we have mentioned Is wortliy of the best days of American statesinansiiip, and may well be a ?cepted as full assurance that during his Administration the Government of \ the I'nlted States in Its dealinp?* with all peo pies will ever be, In his own words, "sure of "the right, free from all offence, moved neither ?by passion nor by selfishness, and actuated 'only by upright and patriotic considerations." .1 

PLATT IDYL. That was g glowing tribute which a writer over tl'?' signature, "A Btalwart Itepublican," paid to Senator Thomas C. Platt a few days ago in the columns pf the S.-nator's personal organ. With the charm of idyllic simplicity ?t united great forcefulnos of staimi? nt. tender feeling ""'? ptofooild emotion. The writer has been disturbed by what be calle "thla continuai "wrangle and Jangl?? !n liie press about Platt, "morning, ".??'ii nini night, high ?lays. lini.days, "Sundays and every <!.iy." In three or four paragraphs full of eloquence and poetry h?? de stnibc* i'?:?' daily current ?if events in this and in foreign countries; the gucccsalon of Infancy, childhood, youth, manhood and ?>ld age; the changes in administrations' gad in forms of government; the relations with one another of em] 1rs?? kingdoms and republics, and says that, "in spite of all this, above the hum of exelte "ment can be heard In this great city of the "world the continual siineMk. 'Down with "Plait!'" lie cannot understand lt cannot un? derstand, we presame) In the lirst place, why there should be any auch "squeak," and, in the second place, why the "sijueak" should be heard "above the bum." Then he says. In the true oratorical manner, "Who Is Plait;" and. of course, answers bla own question. All great orators and writer-; do that. "The Mon. Tboman <". Platt," h?? says now ilingin? his oams abroad in full "is an "American citizen educated, honest, respected, "and successful both in business nnd politi??, "while his detractors have failed in on?' or the "other or both; a man who lives a simple nini "unostentatious life: t?i whose presen???? access "is easy, at home or in business); a good ciilzen, "who enjoys lus vacations In his own country, "not abroad; a leader, not a tyrant; a die? "Clpllnarlan, ry>t a martinet: a man who is more "sought than he aecka." There you bave him in silhouette a masterful profile, ami speaking likeness. Hut there are detalla that remain to be tilled. "Stalwart Republican" his seen th" great man close at band; haa "visited" him, In G?? ?:. 11?? diii lr as he narrates with great sue clnctness, "one Sunday morning." "Il was '.? ?. ?

We Jodge from this communication, however, that In his cn*c tbe remedy Is easy and clone at | hand: He can fold two nr three thicknesses <?f his ear over the drum. Then, If be really wants some other music, he can hear Qulgg blow los own horn. ?fft. QilGO'S CONFESSION. It was a good deal of a COUM down, but lie had to make It. Mr. CJolgg Confesses that lu? is a w?-ak creatore In th?? hands of nn tin scrupulous constitution. All through the sum iner and fall he wns It. The constitution was nothing, the Repobllcan voters and their wishes amounted to nothing, In ids own mightiness] h<? ruled, ilk?? a king, bv divine right, and nn nonnced whom "the organisation" would have and whom It w mid not bave us ? "f Tri ria ta for Mayor, without even waiting for the delegates to be elected to the nominating convention. Mr. Qulgg was as absolute as eooM be, but now he has discovered that then is a constitution to be Obeyed, lie has written a letter to Mr. ; Yereance, full of conciliation and promise ?if reform, and profuse with regrets that the re? forms he Is so anxious to promut?? for th?? sake of unity ennnot be Ondertaken now. because, he says, we must "go nhead with our primaries, "with our Assembly district conventions, wllh "the election of our new ?"ounty ?Committee "and wllh Its organization. These processes "are mandatory under the constitution, and "cannot he avoided without self destruction." Sin???? Mr. ?juigg at last admits th?? necessity Of obeying the constitution as the price of or? ganisation ? xisti'iiec, ,i is Interesting to learn how he olu vs lt. As he says, th?.nstitutlon requires the holding of prlninrles on the second Tuesday of December. For the ronnnltt???? not to hold them Is to commit suicide, lint tho coiistllutlon contains forty-three articles, nil of equal authority. No one la more sacred than iiiiv other. Artici?? XXIX says th?? primaries i.hall be held on th" second Tu.-day of Decem? ber. That la binding. Article XVII saya: "All "rolls, records nnd pnp?-rs In the custody of rue "secretary (of each district association) shall "be open for examination and copying by mem "bers at all ronsannble hours." That is bind? ing nlso. Article XV says: "Tweuty days be "fore the holding of each convention the Coun "ty Cr.mmittee shall fix . . . the number of "delegates t?> Which each district will be eu "tltled In such convention, and give notice "thereof to th?? district associations." That can? not be avoided without sell-destruction. Then, Article XX.W III provides that "If the Hepub "llcau vote of an election district at a general "election shall be les? than the number of "members born?? upon the roll of the associa? tion," such association shall be dissolved. That, too, is mandatory, and cannot be avoided without self-destruction. Vet every one of these const It tit ional provi? sions has been disobeyed by Mr. Qulgg and his committee, Mr. William C. Wilson has told how the Beere taries <?f fourteen election dis? trict associations in the XXVIIth Assembly Distri??! refused to show their rolls as the con? siltutioii requires, nnd it Is a matter of common knowledge that In general the rolls are not open. Mr. Wilson has also told how, in the Fifth and other districts of the XXVIIth, no notice was given of tin* number of delegates to the conventions last f.ill until three or four days before the election, the object being to prevent the Low men In th?? organization from perfecting plans to carry the district. And as to Article XXXVIII, the machine Committee .?n Organization Itseir admits that obedience to thai mandate would rs-ialra the dissolution ot almost every association In the ?-Ity. If, then, Mr. Qulgg can disObey BO readily ttmse articles of th?? constitution, why is he compelled t<? re? tard the fourth so sacredlyl Or, if be must ??bey one. linn can lie ride roughshod over others? ll?? cannol be absolute monarch at one moment and a constitutional offlcar the next. Either he can poetpone the primaries and ef? face himself at on???? in thl intorvsts of har inony, as 1"? prof-vscs willingness to do, or he iias already deatroyed every vestige ?>f his au? thorlty by ids previous defiance <'f tiie funda? mental law of his organisation Thar? is the dilemma from which there is no escape. Mr. Quigg*fl letter makes It Imponible for iiiin t<> Ignore th?? constitution without con? feaslng thai his machine Is dead. Il?? saya that processes mandatory under th?? constitution "cannot be avoided without eelf-deettruetlon.** Vi-t tin? committee has hitherto repeatedly d?? :'.??! tin? constitution's mandate, secreted the rolls, fad ?I to pobllsh due notices, refused '?< llBorganlze ttu? large number >>f associationa which, by tii?- ndmlsalon <>f the leaders, are Ilio gal.
