'Wbm Ales are cold with wintry stars, and hills Are white with jester-even's snow, and lie In ghostly state beneath the ghostly _ * y; When many a gusty blast the darkness fills With ever lonely, homeless sound, and chills The window panes with frost; when crackling fly The sparks about the hearth, and glow and die, While In the pause his note the cricket trills; Ob, then how dear Is home! and what a sense Of ruddy warmth and peace beguiles the mind! And what a charm in listening while the wind Blows fierce outside, through winter's starry tents, And dies away around the window pane, _ And ever rises loud, and dies again ! — Kirnest Warburton Shurtleff. £N0EL MI'S « 1«% OEL CLAYTON was carl and gaunt, with clear, candid, blue eyes, and his white hands, small and nervous-looking, were as well kept as those of a woman. He was thirty, and a splash of gray on either temple, a strand or two of white in his mustache, made him look older. He was broad-chested and muscula: by all rules—he should have been a sol dier—he looked an "open air" man, but for five years he had been writing short stories, novelettes and serials for the weekly press. It was good, nervous work. His name was becoming known, for he had the happy knack of blending pathos with hu mor. He had traveled widely, and an Australian bush idyl at the beginning of the week would be followed again by a story of rustic life In the dear «West Country that he loved so well. He lived quite alone, worked—and smoked—from morning to night, loved his profession, and had practically drop ped all his friends—male and female— and when a fit of the not infrequent blues got him by the throat, threw his pen into the grate and ordered up his landlady's children, and pandemonium reigned for an hour. Sometimes he gave them pennies, but not always—small coin of the realm is not always available to authors—but the romps were huge, and he enjoyed them. Of course there was a woman at the bottom of the tangle of the man's life, and women complicate things sometimes —he would have said "always." On one particular evening he was alone and writing, when Jim Courtenay was shown in—and Jim was an old and tried friend —about the only friend the lonely, self-absorbed man had, and so the in comer sat down and lighted his pipe, and did not bother the author for quite a quarter of an hour, aud then Noel rose and stretched himself. "What is It this time, Noel?" "Oh, the usual thing—love; and can didly I am getting so sick of writing love stories." "Ah! you feel like that?" "Man alive, this is Christmas Eve, and somehow—somehow—my thoughts went back with a jump, and I remembered one Christmas Eve when-" "Your pipe's out, Noel!" "Aye, so it is. Well, there was one Christmas Eve when-" "My dear boy, are you worrying about her still?'' "Yes," and then a long pause- 1 It is the privilege of chums to sit si lent for a spell. "And all this happened four or five years ago. I never heard the rights or wrongs of the story." Noel crossed the room, and digging both hands Into his pockets, looked at his chum. "There is nothing to know. After the four happy years of married life, trouble came between us, lies came between us and—and—here I am aud It's Christmas Eve. Of course our baby was oD)y a mite—a wee, blue-eyed, golden-haired mite; couldn't walk, crawled, you know; but we were awful chums, and when she wept and took our mite—well," and the man's laugh hurt his own ears. "Well, then I took to writing love stories—love! old chap, with a happy ending—bishops! bridesmaids, bouquets and blessings! aud"—his temporary excitement had left him—he added dryly: "And it pays! Now go, old chap. 1 must get my stuff done for the early post." and Chum went out while Noel turned again to his interrupted work. Between each line on every page quaint turns of expression, quaint thoughts haunted him, a dead past spoke to him. The girl-wife had been very sweet, very lovable, very beautiful—and had marred two lives. There should be a special place of tor ment for the person who deliberately comes between two people who love each other and smilingly warps two lives. Pearl Clayton was as easily led as • child, a soft, emotional, weak little woman, and when Nosi returned from a few days' holiday he found the house closed and Pearl and Baby had depart ed. Noel drifted for a little bit, the shock unmanned him terribly, but his pen was bis sole source of income, and it had to be plied if body and soul were to be kept together, and In a very few weeks he had, to some extent, regained his mental balance, and his work improved. The eve of Christmas and the day Itself appeals to most hearts, aud on this particular eve Noel kept thinking back •ad thinking back while he wrote. How well he remembered the extra abed stocking ne induced the nurse to halt, and bow yulky it looked and fait or Christmas morning. And then came school, college, âne than married life. When the scribbling fit was on him Pearl used to draw her low wicker chair close to his writing table, knitting, or daintily fingering white material, soft and downy and fluffy for the prospective wearer, and the few remarks she made seemed to chime in and Identify them selves with what he was writing; but, of course, all this happened five years ago. One odd little trick Pearl had, and Noel remembered it this evening—and missed it. When his pen was working extra busily she used to lay the tips of her fingers upon bis right hand—just where hand meets wrist. She did not incom mode him in the least. He declared her touch Inspired him; they were such pink tipped fingers, and so small, and he had often written with the tiny touch on bis wrist almost unconsciously—only peep ing up from time to time at a sweet oval face, into deep violet eyes love lit. But, of course, this was five years •go. So he wrote on, feeling a little bit ■orry that Chum had not stayed, for af ter all he only had another half hour's work before him, aud then they could sit and chat, and perhaps drown the sound of the bells that he knew would ring out in a few hours. He was just in the frame of mind to summon his landlady's children, but ex cept for himself, the house was empty. There was a Christmas Eve party going on, and Mrs. Marsh and her progeny were attending It. He had been writing for half an hour since Chum had left him, and felt the old familiar touch on his wrist. It was imagination of course, he did not even turn his head, and then he was looking into blue eyes, In the round golden-curled framed face of a boy of four, who laugh ed up at him and presented a rosebud to be ldssed. "Goodness, child—where on earth do yon come from? and who—who brought you? What is your name?" "Eric," and .the child began to make preparations for climbing a lofty knee. THE NEW LEAF. mu the ie. tip»*** ÿrfitë' .S3 "Who brought you here. Baby Eric? How did you come?" Noel fplt like an Irish member of Par liament, for "no answer was given," but a wee form, full of hugs and kisses, got fast hold upon him, and said gravely, and yet with a sweet air of command: "Just come'd—and now if you're not too busy, mister Father-" "Yes, my son." "P'raps—I'd better go to bed." "But, my child—my little son—who brought you here? where is your moth er?" and the tali man, suddenly releasing his first-born, paced up and down. Of coursp, Chum had left the door open, nnd someone had told the child to walk straight in—and the child had—straight in. The author—his tiny son was on the floor now, saying things to the cat, aud it deserved every word, being a cat that licks stamps off letters, and loves bacon and boiled eggs—thrust his hands deep into his pockets and looked down, sad eyed, at little Sunny-face. "Yes, perhaps you had better come to bed." *••••** If Chum would only come, if some thing would only happen to break the silence, a silence only cleft by the sigh of a child. The church was only at the end of the street. He could hear the bell-ringers shuf fling along the frosty pavement, in a few minutes—and he bent to his work. Half asleep, half awake, he was con scious of the old, almost forgotten touch upon his wrist—a dream doubtless—but he could not shake it off, and then he looked down. Kneeling as of yore beside him, blue eyes tear-dimmed, was I'earl. "I have returned, Noel." It was a quavering little voice, but it thrilled him. How like she was to their child. And then the bells clashed forth their message. "Peace on Earth, Good Will Towards Men," and to two hearts they carried a sweeter, deeper message still. No word was spoken. A small figure, in a smoking jacket that reached to his heels, stood at the dividing d«>or, an eager face turned to either. And husband and wife kissed silently. Watching tha Old Yea* Out. Watching the old year out has been a common custom In many lands. In most countries it assumes with the se rious minded the phase of devotion. In many countries where Roman Catho licism is the prevalent form of faith the year Is begun with midnight masses. Among the Greek Catholics the same usage prevails. It declined In the Church of England, but was revived by several of the dissenting bodies, the watch nlffht of the Methodists being merely a modification of the once gen eral practice. Among the oonvlviaily inclined, however, watch night la taken anything but seriously, and the new year la welcom ed with such signs of rejoicing as to one who did not under stand the customs would seem to Indl cate that all men were heartily tired of existence and glad to see their years go by as speedily as possible. OLD CHRISTMAS SAYINGS. An old German saying is that be tween 11 and 12 o'clock on Christmas eve water can be turned into wine. A Montenegrin saying about Christ mas eve Is "To-night earth Is blended with Paradise." The lamp, or candle, must not be al lowed to burn Itself out on Christmas eve or there will be a death In the family within the year. A Magyar superstition is that any one who eats nuts without honey on Christmas will lose his teeth. Another Is that a pillow turned at midnight will bring dreams of a fu ture Jover. It Is unlucky to trip on Christmas day. The ancient Scandinavians and Anglo-Saxons called Christmas "Moth er's Night," the name being handed doÄ to the Chrstianlzed people from an old pagan festival formerly cele brated, about this season of the year. The Sicilian children place penny royal In the beds Christmas eve be cause they believe It always flowers at the exact hour of Christ's birth. A live coal should never be carried out of the house on Christmas eve. All children born at midnight < December 31 will become great and famous. New Year's Eve In Italy. Don't you wish you were an Italian on New Year's? Promptly at the stroke of 12 on New Year's eve there are rustling and bustling and merry laugh ter as each maiden kisses all the young men she can catch. It Is the only mo ment In the year when custom permits her such a liberty, and she is not slow to take advantage of it Then, the new year '-avlng made its bow, the party breaks up, the young folk take a walk, and the first person of the opposite sex which each roisterer meets Is consid ered destined to be that merrymakers future partner in life. A Youthful Schemer. Little Emerson—You don't believe In any such ridiculous myth as Santa Claus? Tough Jimmy—Naw ! I'm next to dat game.

THB CHRISTMAS SPIRIT. ? of to MESSAGE DELIVERED PRESIDENT TELLS CON GRESS HIS IDEAS. CURRENCY, CORPORATION SUPER VISION, LABOR AND COURTS DULY CONSIDERED. Washington, Dee. 9.—President Roosevelt 's message to congress was read in the house and senate Tuesday. It was long, but devoted principally to currency, corporation supervision, labor and the courts. Obviously it was in tended as a final resume of the policies by which Roosevelt haB become one of the most noted of the presidents in up holding and as such is a vigorous and statesmanlike document. There is little left betöre congress that the president had not already urged to enactment, and these advices are largely repeated President Roosevelt 's last mes sage to congress is introduced by a financial statement Bhowing that Boven years and three months of his administration there has been a net surplus of nearly $100,000,000 of re ceipts over expenditures, a reduction of the interest bearing debt by $90,000, 000 in spite of the extraordinary ex pense of the Panama canal and a sav ing of nearly $9,000,000 in the annual intorest charge. There have been no new taxes and no increase of taxes; on the contrary, some taxes have been takon off; and there has been a reduc tion of taxation so far as governed by federal regulations. Uhe president points out the imper fections of the present currency sys tem and hopes that the currency com mission will be able to propose a sys tem that will do away with existing dofects. The reading of the message began in the senate at 12:15, and in the house few minutes later. The galleries of both houses were well filled. Congress Reads Copy. All senators and representatives were supplied with printed copies of the message, which contained an elaborate appendix, accompanied by numerous illustrations showing the results of the work of the forestry bureau. Senators and members gave compar atively little attention to the reading of the message, but most of them busied themselves with the printed copies before them. Summary of Message. Repeal the Sherman anti-trust law. Increase the salaries of all federal judges. Admit New Mexico and Arizona to statehood. Change the system of promotion in the army to secure the best men for the commands rather than thoso whose only claim is seniority in point of service. Pass an employers' liability law which is fair to the wage oarner and the employer alike. Enact laws which will effectually guard against the deforestation of the nation. These are some of the prominent fea tures in the message of President Theodore Roosevelt to the congress which opened itB session yesterday. The president is more reserved in his mes sage than customary and is less radical. Ho has condemned the Sherman law and takes the position that all com binations and mergers of trusts should not be prohibited under the penal statute, pointing out that some of these combinations work directly for the gen oral good of the public. The message devotes considerable timo to the subject of the courts and the attacks which have been made on thorn in the recent campaign and ho sots out that while there may be in competents in office it is through the members of the court that reforms must come, as the judiciary is appointed for life. The president takes the posi tion that the conditions modify the laws of the nation and what may have been good law 50 years ago is modi fied by the trend of public opinion and tho circumstances. The president's position in relation to army promotions will undoubtedly cause a furore in army circles, as ho makes the direct charge that some of tho officers who are elevated to the higher offices have no ability to com mand. Following the swearing in of Senator Cummins of Iowa, and tho reading of the message, the senate adjourned. Tho president has decided to re appoint W. D. Crum (colored) collector of the port at Charleston, South Caro lina. It was the original appointment of Crum that caused such a furore in the sonate three years ago. President-elect Taft is at the national capital. j Discouraged by his efforts to induce hsi wife to return and live with him, Charles Klinkert, manager of the state fish hatchery at Twisp, Wash., shot and killed himself recontly.

Va., the maximum pen alty under the law.

Bold Robbery at Portland. With one mail guarding the entrance to the East Side bank at Portland, Ore., about 6 o 'clock Monday night, two thugs entered the bank where Presi dent Newhall and his son, Roger, were just closing up the business of the day, covered thorn with revolvers and se cured about $16,000 in gold and cur rency. They then made their escape and there is no clue as to their where abouts. President Newliall states that the robbery will in no way affect the stability of the bank, as there is still plenty of money on hand to meet all demands. Catalogue Siren Lured Parmer. A farmer living near a Kansas town ordered a stove from a Chicago house. The picture looked pretty good, and the price seemed reasonable. Cash was sent with the érder, and the stove ar rived from the factory in Ohio a few weoks later. It was carried homo after a few dollars' freight bill was paid. Taking it off the wagon, a hole was broken through tho bottom of it. A letter was sent to tho concern asking that repairs be sent. A reply was re ceived to the effect that the agent of the railroad company reported that the stove was delivered in good condition, and in fact, the farmer had signed a statement to that effect. But if the farmer would send the broken part, charges prepaid, and pay the express age on the repairs sent, they would be glad to do the mending, says Retail Merchant. In the meantime the farmer needed stove badly. He w.ent to the local hardware man, there was shown a stove which looked very much better than the one he had at homo, and the price was a dollar less, not counting the freight charges. In fact, the stove was a better one. The farmer bought the stove, told the merchant what a fool he was for sending away for one, and blamed his wife and daughter for do ing so. He said that he had done with the catalogue houses and since then has been a staunch advocate of home trading. He wrote to the catalogue house offering to return tho stove if they would allow him half the amount that he paid them for it. They replied that they were sorry, but would ex change other goods for the stove, pro viding the farmer would pay freight charges. This provoked the farmer to such an extent that he stored the stove out in the barn and charged up the amount he paid for it to experience. in Prices to Producers.
