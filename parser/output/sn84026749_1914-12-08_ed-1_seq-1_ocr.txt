THE NATION AS VIEWED BY PRESIDENT "While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circum stances of the whole age have been altered by war. We Face new tasks without partisan feeling. War has in terrupted the means of trade and the processes of production." "The United States should be ready to serve itself and man kind. We nave grossly erred in stunting and hinder ing the development of our merchant marine." "We have year after year debated without end or conclusion the best policy to pursue with regard to the use of the ores, and forests and water powers." "We withheld by regulation. Remedy and correct these mis takes and omissions." "Give a larger self government to the people of the Philip pines." "The Government must open our gates of trade to South America, open them wide, before streams of merchandise will flow through them." "It is a matter of deep regret that the great subject of rural L credits-remains to-be dealt with; have rendered it impossible to complete a bill for passage at the piesent session." The President appealed for approval of the plan of charting the Alaskan coast. "The people of the United States are not jealous of the amount the Government costs. It is not expenditure, but extravagance that we should fear being criticised for." "To defend ourselves against attack? We have always found means to do that and shall find them whenever it is necessary without calling our people away from their necessary tasks to render compulsory military service in times of peace." "It is right that the National Guard of the States should be developed and strengthened. Our policy (on war pre paredness) will not be for an occasion. It will be conceived as a permanent and settled thing. We have not been negli gent of national defense. We are not unmindful of great re sponsibility.

Gentlemen of the Congress: The session upon which you are now entering will be the closing session of the Sixty-third CongTess. a Congress, I venture to say, which will long be re membered for the great body of thought ful and constructive work which it has done. In loyal response to thc thought and needs of the country. I should llko in this address to review the notable w,r, ftrtrl tn? In mnlt. mtemint A KMunntnt of Hr but no doubt We stand too near the work that has been done and are ourselves too much part of It to play the part of historians toward it. Moreover, our thoughts are now more of the future than of the past. While we have worked at our tasks of peace the circumstances of the whoio agei have been altered by war. What we have done for our own land and our own people we did with the best that was in us, whether of character or of Intelligence, with sober enthusiasm and I h. confidence In the DrinclDles unnn which we were acting which sustained is at every step of the difficult under taking; but it is done. It has passed from our hands. It is now an establish ed part of the legislation of the country. Its usefulness, its effects will disclose themselves In experience. What chiefly strikes us now, as wo look about us dur ing these closing days of a year which i will be forever memorable in the history of the world, is that we face new tasks, havo been facing them these six months, must face them In the months to come. face them without partisan feeling, like men who have forgotten everything but a comtnan duty and the fact that we are representatives of a great people whose thought is not of us. but of what America owes to herself and to all mankind in such circumstances as these upon which we look amazed and anxious.
