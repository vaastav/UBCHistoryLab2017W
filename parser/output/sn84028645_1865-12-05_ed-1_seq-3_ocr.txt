Secretary Harlan to Leave the Cabinet— Smuggling on the Frontier —Decisions in Regard to Bounties. .: m ,. Nkw York, Dec. 4. The Herald special says: Mr. Harlan. Secretary of the Interior, has commenced his preparations to secure his election to the United States Senate. This indicates that he intends to leave the Cabinet at no distant day. It has been the impression here for some time pustthat Mr. Harlan is the only member of the present Cabinet not In full accord with the Presi dent. Collectors on the frontier report that sin utters, who have been so active, aro becoming alarmed at the preparations made to Hpprehend them, and that the business is falling off. Merchants along the linn, both in the Suites and Canada, are shutting tip their shops and suspending operations; Hence the Revenue otllcers inaugurated the system of closely examining theclnthlng of females who cross the frontier. That clatta of travel is falling oil; not one woman crosses tho St. Lawrence now where twenty did before. . The 2d Comptroller has decided that In the case of a soldier detailed as a clerk in' the War Department, payment of bounty maturing while on Buch service cannot be maile, a extra pay is received for extra du ty of this kind. ;. ' ,. . It is also decided, under the same author-' Ity, that soldiers who entered the Veteran ' Reserve Corps under provisions of Guneral Order No. 191, of June 25, 18(14, is not en tl led to any installment bounty maturing when serving as clerk In any department, hut if discharged with all the men of his regiment, because Government no longer1 requires the service of their entire term of enlistment, he maintains the same footings' and rights in regard to bounty claims as ertain to the balance of the members of the same regiment. : -. . r. Organization of Congress. i New YouK,Dec.4.-TbeTrlbu:!e'8Special says' The Senate will convene to-day at 12 o'clock, await the organization of the House, and adjourn. A Senatorial caucus jWill then bo held, to prepare lists of c'om .mittees. . With what temper the resolution. io f the House caucus, raising a joint stand ingcommittee upon the admission ot South fern members, will be received, Is not en tirely known. Some Senators, approving, the spirit and intent of the resolution, are' jealous of any infringement of thd rights ol the twe bodies, under the Constitution, to regulate admissions to their respective or ganizations. There is no doubt of com bined action, but the passage of a resolution by the House affixing conditions to mcm bctviuip in the Senate, and vice verba, is so suggestive of irregularity, If not inconsist ency, that it is thought possible, by influ ential persous . in both branches of the National Legislature, that similar though separate committees may be raised in lieu of tbe joint committee. The House will meet at the usual hour and go through with the form of organiza tion without delay. The several caucus nominees, and espe cially door-keepers, have had little time tor their devotions to-day, so Incessantly and Importunate have brn the place-seekers. These candidates are from the heroes of many battles to the widow's son, who wants to be a page, and their name is legion. Alter organizing, the House will adjourn to Tuesday, when the message and accom panying reports will be received. From Fortress Monroe. Fortress Monroe, Dec. 1st.
