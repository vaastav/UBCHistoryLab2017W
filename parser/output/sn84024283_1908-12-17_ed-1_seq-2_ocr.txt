GETTING IMPATIENTI $52,000,000 FOR MOST OF ADDITIONAL APPROPRI ATION WANTED FOR RIVERS AND HARBORS. ALSO COAST DEFENSE NEEDS Organization of Militia Force of 350, 000,000 Recommended Increase Last Year Was Nineteen Thousand. Washington, D. C. In his annual report Secretary Luke E. Wright of the war department estimates that an increase of $52,000,000 in the appropri ation for the coming fiscal year will be necessary, principally for improve ment of rivers and harbors. The ex penditures lor the fiscal year ending June 30, 1908, were $130,706,447.99, and Secretary Wright's estimate for 1908-9 is. In round figures, $189,000 000. The appropriation for 1907-8 was $137,635,847.20. The increase asked lor Is largely for river and harbor work, and other public work of a civil character, for which purpose about $24,000,000 is aBked. Of the balance, about $10,590, 000 Is an additional estimate for the support of the army, military academy and the militia. For military public works, such as fortifications, arsenals, military posts, etc., the estimates call for an increase of $17,800,000. Secretary Wright specially recom mends an addition of 612 officers to the army, and also approves a policy for the elimination from service of all officers who fall to maintain the requisite standard of efficiency. Both of these propositions were before con gress at its last session, and will be strongly urged this year. Strength of Army.

PLAN TARIFF RAISE DESIGNS OF "STANDPATTERS" CAN BE PERCEIVED. Repetition of Action of 1896 is Their Idea President Taft Must Be the Main Reliance of the People Now. Washington dispatches say that Mr Albert Clarke, secretary of the Home Market club, which the country should take notice has established headquar ters in Washington in order to look after things during the tariff hearings before the ways and means commit tee, says that the friends of protec tion are to be congratulated on' the results of the election, announces the Indianapolis News. We should say that that was a statement the signifi cance of which would better appear: later. He goes on to say, however. that the obvious meaning of the elec tion Is that "the tariff is to be revised on protection principles and brought up to date." Equally the obvious meaning of the election, from the Home Market club's view, is that the emphasis should be put on the "up." Business, Mr. Clarke continues, has revived in consequence of the election, and that there need be no fear as to how the tariff revision will affect in dustry. It is full early to get to close quarters on the subject, though the admirable Charles Francis Adams:, manifestly thinks that there is no time like the present for doing anything.. But there is simply this to be said: The standpatters will take the elec tion as giving them carte blanche for such a saturnalia on the tariff as the Republicans Indulged in after defeat ing Bryan in 1896, when they passed" the precious Dingley bill to take the place of the Wilson-Gorman law. The people generally have forgotten that the Dingley bill not only ad vanced rates above the McKinley bill, but that it advanced some rates out rageously under the hypocritical pre tense that they were to be lowered ta, making reciprocity treaties. Mr. Mc Kinley himself was deceived by the standpatters in this. What followed was the ignominious death of all reci procity treaties and the maintenance of these superexalted rates. Now we are to have a revision which makes. Mr. Clarke of the Home Market club rub his hands with satisfaction. Your plain, ordinary citizen may well sit up and take notice! What we mean to say here as to the time being full early for discussion is this: The ways and means commit tee, which is prejudiced and packed in advance on the subject, is laying the foundation for another tariff raised and increased wherever any interest wants it so, and if it be not possible to put It through at this session, to have it ready as the basis for nego tiation when President Taft comes in. Then will come the time, if ever, that the country will get a hearing. Mr Taft will stand against the combined tariff beneficiaries or he will not. The people, the consumers, will either get some relief or they will not. Lincoln once spoke of "our tariff housekeep ing." It is that. We shall have it with us until a time in the future that need not be reckoned with now. The question at this time is whether the people are to have a proper meas uhe of relief, and President Taft will be in for a large measure of answer to that question. For the present the standpatters are having It all their own way and are making the premises to suit themselves. But they reckon ill if they leave the people out. The question was not settled, as some of them devoutly believe, by the election. That simply opened it for a begin ning. Tribute Levied on Consumer. The consumer pays so much tax to the protected tariff baron as the baron secures by right of spoliation under the tariff. The consumer cannot bene fit. United States concerns make steel for less cost than the manufacturers of any other country in the world'. Yet the consumers of any other coun try can buy American steel for the lowest prices, while steel users in this country pay the highest. The high tariff cannot increase the wages of labor. Germany, France, Spain and China are all high tariff countries. Why is not labor in those countries paid as good wages as here? Manipulating the law of value to le galize plunder is a losing game. Pa ternalistic protection to a preferred class destroys the rights of the citi zen. And high tariff Is the means to that end. One of these days the American people will discover It, and high tariff will be banished forever.' Any change in the tariff schedules, Speaker Cannon said in Chicago, would disturb business. It certainly would disturb the business of the men who are getting more than their share under cover of the tariff. But it wouldn't disturb a bit the vast ma jority, whom they are holding up. An Uncle Joe Compromise. No prospect of tariff revision dis turbs the Rockefellerlan serenity of Uncle Joe Cannon. "There must be mutual concession and compromise," he twitters. Uncle Joe has cleur and definite notions about tariff compro mises. The public prays for a reduc tion of duties. The protected manu facturers Insist that the duties be doubled. Then Uncle Joe compro mises by leaving the schedules as they are. According to a hymn composed in honor ot the Thane of Skibo: '"Tls not a nation but the world To him should grateful be." If you seek his monument, look at your tax' bills. Republican jubilation over the larger vote cast in Arkansas for Taft than for Roosevelt seems to be inspired by a hope that the state may go Repub lican before the end of the twenty-first century.
