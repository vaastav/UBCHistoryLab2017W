Capt Amundsen, who set out in a small rraft with a crew of but eight men. found the north magnetic pole, whose discovery Is originally accredited to Ross In 1S31. although many scientists doubt that Ross really located this elusive guide to the compasses of the world. The North magnetic pole has been gen erally assumed hy geographers as being on Bothnia, the most northerly peninsula of the American continent, and close to King Wllliamelaiid It If supposed to hn a shifting sphere ot Influence, though its variations are not grent.

As yet but one man haa been taken from the mine. It was hoped that two more would bo taken out this evening, but this Is doubtful Bodies Deeply Buried. Two bodies supposed 1o be In tho twelfth lei had not up to noon today been recovered, and It la feared that they are burled under the coal and rock. It Is thought that two other men are burled under the mass of coal nnd rock which burled the trip. The engines could not move ihe trip from under tho coal and rock and It was necessary to cut the cable last night. In order to facilitate and aid the work of the rescue party. Water Interferes. The rescue party consists of about tlftv men. and it Is thought that with this force some of the bodies will be recovered noon. Owlr g to the wrecking of the pumrs. water Is accumulating very rapidly and is Interfering with the prog ress of the tescuers. Force Was Great. As progress Is made, more evidence of the force of the explosion Is found. Loaded cars were thrown from the track and the trucks torn from the bed of the car. The coal above the lxx of the cars that were blown from the track, was swept off tho car level with the top of the box. As yet the complete list of names of the entombed miners cannot be learned.
