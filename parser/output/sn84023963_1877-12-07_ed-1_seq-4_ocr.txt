IMMENSE STOCK fr it ! -AT LADY G A r 03111$ Fraud ulency's first annual message was sent to Congress on IMon day last. In it he shows he is arrayed on the side of the bondholders: and from his arguments will veto any bill to re peal the infameus resumption act, or to provide for the ramonetiridion of silver, by making it a legal tender, unless the bondholders are privileged from the op erations of the law. It is a little sinea- lar he being a western man, should so much oppose the true interests of the laboriug classes of the west, bat we sup pose he has received his price, and con sequently the contraction mill must grind on-althongh it grinds the bones of honest labor every where, and makes the widow and orphan sigh for bread, ami countless thousands rush into hank ruptcyand crime, and mourn for better timc3, which, alas I will not come du ring his administration.
