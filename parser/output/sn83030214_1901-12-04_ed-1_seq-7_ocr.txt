A XARCHISTS IN LONDON. -CBUr approval of president KOOSEVELTS VIEWS. CIXIOUS CORONATION' CLAIMS - NEW * ' PB INCE OF WALES FOLLOWING FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS. - -ic'-t: 1901: By The New-York Tribune.) [8T CABLE TO THE THIBr.VE.I London. Dec 4. 1 a. m.-.Vo portion of the lessTs Message is more cordially approved /here than that referring to the question of ° n treatment of anarchists. It i? considered - ■■iingiy gratifying that President Roosevelt ' ul( j nO i be jifrai.l to make proposals, which 'the surface are open to the criticism that c ' are subversive of personal liberty in the -alter of opinion. In this country there is a onP undercurrent of feeling against laws 5 4ch permit and actually encourage the immi •Jon ■>' foreign anarchists. London, espe ., i;v f ( els strongly on the point, and owing to !i f vast number of undesirable aliens who have ÜB.am lhelr abod^ in the Ea!?t End. the me " nofr would gladly welcome any restrictive » jbt^s Ir reference to the proposal that -jskind should bind itself together to make pjrehy. like piracy, a crime against the law » nati'T.'- it is pointed out that the difficulty « to define what anarchy consists of and to obtain trustworthy evidence against those hold j-r such a doctrine before they commit overt .(•j which would render them amenable to or 'aerv criminal law. To-day's newspapers refer to the important - sw •- rnshli HI Roosevelt's first' Message to -.ju^ress. some of them characterizing it as a ■aaatilEsbre document. Upon the whole, how ever, it is regarded as essentially a conservative Etatenient of policy, especially in reference to f acrt matters as trusts and reciprocity. The President's remarks on the latter question are not deemed to be an adequate execution of the views expressed in President McKlnley's last speech at Buffalo, and the British hopes of the decisive modification of the protectionist system of the United Stites are consequently disap pointed. It is noted with satisfaction that the istinsian canal negotiations have been conduct si as the friendliest manner, and it is left to the Opposition newspapers to ask what concessions has the British Empire secured in return for the ajsiTfaS of England's claims. The language cf the Mesage on the subject of the Monroe Doctrine Is spoken of as uncompromising in its directness. "The world is." says "The Stand ard." "practically warned that the Western Hemisphere is not to be made a field for terri torial ambition or aggression from outside." This." it is added, "was no doubt Monroe's meaning, and it is now reasserted in the most definite terms." No objection is raised to the precise terms in which the doctrine is enun ciated, but th«=y are evidently not rol ishri. and it Is suggested that some of the eu?r?y devoted to expanding and repeating the famous doctrine might 1- spared, since there is little desire on the part of any foreign power to extend the area of militarism to the New World. The sinking of the torpedo boat destroyer Salmon causes grave disquiet. It i: ; difficult to efap- ■*>" conclusion that there must be some common defect of construction besides even the proved tendency to buckling; behind all these cases .of mishap to torpedo boat destroyers. Close upon sixty claims of vices to be per foraed at the coronation of King Edward have been submitted fcr consideration to the Court of CJairr.s, which m;ets in the Privy Council cham sir at Whitehall to-day. Among other curious claims is that of the Duke of Norfolk, as Lord cf the Workshop, to present a pair of gloves 10 the sovereign, and to bold the sceptre with the cross while the peers do homage. Besides this special claim, the duk-=>, in the right of th- Earldom of Arundel. claims the office of butler at th- banquet. Nobody who was present a* tie proceedings of the last court, which sat in 1555. is now alive, but precedent as revealed by the records will be strictly followed. In virtue cf the office of Lord Chancellor. Lord ■tlsbury is expected t- preside over th» court to-fiay. The Prince of Wales is quickly adapting him self to his great position, and in accepting the t£ce r-s president of St. Bartholomew's Hos pital he is following worthily In. the footsteps of his father, v.ho has always taken the deepest is^r- s: in the hospitals of London.

TIIK XKW DEMOCRATIC MOSES WILL HAVE TROUBLES OF HIS OWN. CROKER TO SHIFT BURDENS WEARY OF TASK OF LEADERSHIP, HE WILL TAKE A BEST. TO GO ABROAD EARLY NEXT YEAR—CAR ROLL LIKELY TO BE LEFT IN CHARGE— WHAT THE BOSS SAYS OF SHEPARD AND GOVERNORSHIP NOMINATION. Richard Croker. after a month of reflection, yes terday grade known bis ideas about the landslide of November 5 which swept Tammany out of power. He gave an extended Interview at the Democratic dub, in the course of which he ex plained Tammany's defeat, outlined Tammany's future and dealt with his own personal plans gen erally. While not announcing In so many words that he woull retire from the leadership- of Tam many Hall, he Indicated that at an early date he would make an arrangement by which he would share the c in - of leadership with others, if he did not shift the responsibility to other shoulders en tirely. The Tammany executive committee meets next month to reorganize for the year, and at this me ting Croker will make his ideas known. : "r,>k-T dropped into a chair •■ the Democratic Club and gazed quizzically at a Tribune reporter, who asked him if he had finally determined to retire as leader of •:. Tammany organization. Then he sal I slow '■Well. I don't think I will do muoh more leading m the future. I am getting old and worn out. I cannot be a wheel horse for everybody any longer. I admit that the leader of Tammany Hall should stay in New-York all the year, and actively look after the interests of the organization. I cannot afford to remain here for even the greater part of the year. My health la poor, and it is the rest abroad that enables me to recuperate for what work 1 am able to do here. if I remained in New- York all the year 1 would be unable to do any work at all. I knew i: was wrong for me to go away, but I had to do it to save my life. I suffer a great deal from catarrh and from my stomach, and 1 need the rest and recreation badly. It Is simply Impossible for me to remain here and work any loeger. I have done more work since the election than I did in the course of the campaign." HOW POLITICIANS REGARD- IT. The politicians generally took this to mean yes terday that Croker had determined to step down and out. It is well known that on election night Croker wanted to resign and get out He was per suaded by Senator Timothy I. Sullivan and others to reconsider. Croker is a wealthy man. As Tammany expresses it. be has "made his pile," and has it salted away. He is tired of the strife and turmoil, and wants to turn the organization over to others ard have a. good time. Who his successor will be no Tammany man dares say. There are two factions in the organization. The most powerful is the so-called gambling "combine." which dic tated nominations on trie county ticket last cam paign. The other is what is called the respectable ri*-m«T.t. It is belie < that the gambling "com bine" will dictate the naming of Mr. Croker's suc cessor. That Croker will get out absolutely no Tammany man believes. They say Croker is al ways a "quitter" in the hour of trouble. He wants to "play" for the nt-xt two years, and he can afford to do so. When he thinks Tammany Ims a chance to get back Into power they Bay i "roker will -, ■ mur- srab control. jt!-=t as he wrested it from John C Sbeehan In 1897. Croker's retire ment they add. is Just a plan to lei Tammany ■weather its own hard season. Croker is a fair we.-ther '.■■;■ nd, ami can be expected to hold out his hand hungrily whenever Tammany is In power or about to come into power. It is generally believed that John K. Carroll will tv In charge of thi» organization while Croker Is away. In fact, the executive committee at the meeting to be held next mont:: may go so far aa to name him formally as leader; but all the time It will be know thai <"r<iker is standing in the- background; with his shadow blanketing the whole organization, and ready to return and take control whenever I here Is anything to be accomplish* d by it. As to the State organization. Croker said: "I see that the newspapers .:•■ saying that i want to dominate the State organization, and that 1 am try- Ing to dictate a. new national platform. That is sheer rot 1 am in no physical shape to do any kind of leading, but I Shall always have Tam many's interest at heart and advise as best 1 can. 1 don't know who will succeed to the management of the organization. That will develop later. All 1 know is that I shall go to Europe in January or February, and remain there for some tsm>-." Croker spoke of Devery. saying: "If the charges which have been made against D. very are true, he either ought to be In jail or hanged. But, mind you, these charges have never been proved. The oppo nents of Mr. I >every had every opportunity to prove their charges; they bad the District Attor ney's office: but they did not do so I believe Devery to be an able and efficient Chief of Police. I am not defending Devery or any one else; but I like to See fair play." DUE TO THE NEWSPAPERS. Croker then said, among other things: "it Is useless to inquire into the causes of our defeat last month. One cause was sufficient— the apposi tion of all the newspapers in New-York to Tam many Hall. A? things were, the Republicans could have put up a ticket of their own and won out Their Democratic support amounted to little. The Greater New-York Democracy could have been dispensed with easily. it was simply im possible to win with the.v'h"' 0 press of New-York against us The charges against Tammany reached all the people: our defence was heard by only a few. That is the whole story." Reverting to the State leadership question, I ro ker said- "It Is silly to make a Sight on the lead ership. " I don't care who poses as state leader 1 don't want the Job. and l don't see why anybody should hanker after it. At this time, all Demo crats should be engaged in uniting against the com mon enemy and not in promoting selfish ambitions. it is nonsense too/ to begin at this time to talk about Democratic candidates for Governor next '.ear Let the party get together tlrst. 'As to Tammany's future. Croket said: "Some Mugwumps are talking about Tamrn lr.y going to niece- Nonsense, Tammany will be stronger than ever two years from now. a defeat once in a while I* a good thing for any organization After the "unionists have been In office a couple of years, th* people will see that the Tammany admnistra- Ll,-,'L 1 ,-,' not such a bad thing aft. all. We have been downed before by reform movements, and we always rose up stronger than ever after a few *™" It will be the same story in 1903. Tarn; many is close to the common people of New-York. to referring to England, he added: .'I have been annoyed for years by the newspaper talk about my being an Englishman at heart. It Is all rot. I am a New-Yorker, and an American all through. f Tive in England a part of the year solely for the iVkJ- of m health. I keep race horse* because I fov.- them "and promote my health by looking after them If f had not taken to banes and open air life in England I would not be alive to-day. Mr Croker was asked about the report that fid v-*ird M Shepard was in a sense to become the legal ndviVr -of Tammany: that be was to draft platforms nnd advise its policy, and in ret.u-n be supported i " the Croker-Murphy-McLaughlin-Mack corn line for Governor next year and become the State .ader Mr. Croker said: "There is nothing in that. Fhepard^oes not want such a position. He is not in politics. Mr. Shepard la an able man. He Is a eood -nan and expresses his views like any one ftae but * the odds against him in the last elect on were too great.

From the policy of his great predecessor he has not deviated, but in formulating and carrying out that policy he has struck the American note in a manner wholly his own It is a message to the people of the country that will stir them to the uttermost depths of their beincs and in the reading of which, their patriotism will of kindled to active flames. From its beginning, in its beauti ful tribute to the late President down to and In cluding the signature at its end. the dominant ana far reaching note is its Intense yet wise American ism His recommendation that anarchists be ex cluded from the country is as it should be. and that and the allied recommendation that any man who attempts to kill a President or any one in the line of succession to that great office should be dealt with in the federal courts by a punishment propor tionate to the offence should be followed b> im mediate legislation to that end. „„,„,.,,,.„ ••Recognizing the first importance of commerce and how necessary it is that the markets of tne world should lie open to us. the President makes of prosperity the watchword of his administration. His treatment of the great business interests is broad and statesmanlike, and his conservative recommendations with regard to the trusts are such os to be morally certain to bear an abundant har vest in the way of legislation."

DEATH KNELL wisdom that lies in the para- OF BLIND graph: The first essential in POOL CONCERNS, determining how to Ueal with the great industrial combina tions is knowledge of the facts— publicity.' That comprehensive and far-reaching phrase ought to ring the death knell in America for all blind pool companies. That the government should have supervision of big corporations is a seir-eviuent fact as is also the recommendation that trie rau roadfl should remain the public's servants. me reiteration of the Republican policy of ;- ar r>' n^ American goods in American bottoms, of la> ing a transpacific cable and of building a canal across the isthmus, is strongly and characterist.eail> m;ide That reciprocity is and must be the hand maiden of protection, as the President so wonder fully puts it. I thoroughly believe. This view of the subject is a wise and faneetas one In so far as reciprocity applies to the Western Hemisphere this recommendation is second to none in impor tance The recommendation that the Indian here after be recognised as an individual is timely and in^Taken'a!l in all. in, whole o- In part, it is a broadly comprehensive and intensely patriotic doc ument". It breathes of Am-.-ricanism in its every line and yet at the same time holds that Ameri canism by the strong i-ash of common sense. There is nothing in it that leads one to utter the prayer. "God of our fathers be with us yet. lest we forget, lest we torget." ••Theodore Roosevelt ranks this night higher in the minds of the people of the United States than before he sent this message to them, which so amply justifies his friends and so completely con founds his enemies. To my mind his message and course since he became President have gone a long wav toward deciding who shall succeed him in the White House in 1904. That man will probably be Theodore Roosevelt, of X. w-York." THE
