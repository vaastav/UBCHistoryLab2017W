There is great diversity of opin ion as to the effect of Mr. Crisp's election upon the future of the Democratic party. Our own opin ion is that it does not settle the pol icy of the party, but indicates that next year the fight will be waged for tariff and financial reform, and against such legislation, as the Force bill. Mr. Crisp is able, fair and a thorough-going Democrat and as sincere, though not so ar dent, a tariff reforner as Mr, Mills'. The New York Times regards the election of Mr. Crisp as secured by "the coalition of the demagogery of Hill, the spoils-mongering of Tammany, the protectionism of Gorman and Brice, the half-corrupt, half fanatical free-silver move ment and the old South." These it says "must 'give pause to the men who have believed the Democratic party would be a fit instrumentality for the accomplishment of tariff re form and for the clean and honest administration of the government. . . . Those to whom parties are only instruments for or against a cause will for the present be forced to assume a portion of armed neu trality." The New York Herald says that the result more than ever demon strates the necessity of. dropping Cleveland and Hill and choosin" a new man from the West. "The caucus was divided into Cleveland and Hill camps, and was engaged in nothing more nor less than a struggle to jam down the throat, of the country the candidacy of two men each of whom is planning to spend the next four years in the White House. The feeling is abroad that the personal ambition of Mr. Cleve land and Mr. Hill may seriously split the Democratic party !" The New York World says that no question of broad party policy was involved. "All the caudidates are of one mind as to the great issue ot present politics. All are tariff reformers. Mr. Cjusi is supposed to represent more of conservatism and prudence in tac tics than Mr. Mills. His election represents tha conviction of the majority that the end aimed at by the party namely, the righteous revision and reduction of our tariff is more surely to be attained through conservative action than through o methods more radical. The choice is significant of the dominance of a prudent spirit in the great Demo cratic majority." The New York Sun says the re sult is "a triumph for the conserva tive forces of Democracy and a kick at the mugwumps." The Atlanta Constitution, which has been an earnest champion of Mr. Crisp, says that his election means that the Democrats will o into the fight "with every living issue "that divides the parties," and not upon the tariff alone. The other papers speak in simi lar terms. The independent press is displeased because they think they see the hand of Mr. Hill in Mr. Crisp's election. The Democratic press is satisfied and many are pleased. His North Carolina friends will be glad to know that Rev. Dr. Milburn, the eloquent blind preacher,, has been re-elected Chap lain of the U. S. House. Mr. Morrison, of Illinois, characterized the blind preacher once as"a man who loves God, hais;the devil and voies tnp y -s ' --r v ii Rri,. Mr i 

GOVERNMENT INTIMIDATION. A LESSON, "U. S. vs. W. D. Joyner et ah; juror withdrawn, mistrial and case continued." These two lines from the proceedings of U S. Circuit Court of last Saturday deserve more than a passing notice as they con tain a very striking lesson a les son to the North and a lesson to the South. Having heard the case tried and having talked with the witnesses on both sides we think we can give a fair account of the facts. The case was fairly and impar tially tried, the very able judge presiding with his usual integrity and justice, and the district attorney showing his usual ability and cour tesy and the defendants being rep resented by one of the strongest lawyers in the State. The defend ants are two white men and one negro, all being honest, industrious, poor men who live by the sweat of their brow; men who ste.nd high in the estimation of all who kno them and who a're arraigned as criminals for the first time in their lives; men who were not able to come on the train to . Raleigh to answer the charge against them but came through the country in the snow, sixty miles in a wagon at the command of their great and free (?) country. After an expense of a hundred dollars there was a "mistrial and case continued," and they will have to go over it all again with no possi ble redress. What did they do? The facts arc simple, so simple that the able law yer who defended them did not think it worth while to dispute the Government's testimony; so simple that the able jude in concluding his charge thought proper to state when the officers of the government brought a charge, however ground lessly, they ought to be credited with rood motives. Defendants were charged with violating the Election Law by not allowing one, Hales, to vote, they and t wo others not indicted being the judges of election at Uoeky Mount township, Nash county. Hales testified that in July, ly, ho swore that:he was a resident and voted in Rocky Mount township; that in- August, 1889, he swore he was not a resi dent and so escaped road dutv; that in June, 1890, hoisted his poll-tax in Pitt county and paid tax there, paying no tax in Nash; that in No vember, 1890, he offered to vote and was challenged as bein- a non resident; that the poll-holders took a vote after talking over the matter and that there was a tie vote, two on each side, as to whether he should be allowed to vote- that one of them then remarked to the colored defendant, "Well, Robert, it is a tie and you must vote some way and untie it;" that Robert dropped his head and "studied" awhile and then said that as Hales did not work the road he ought not to vote. Hales furthermore stated on the stand that there was not the slightest attempt to control Robert in his vote; that Robert was a Re publican, and that the whole elec tion was perfectly fair and square witn the Exception of the reiection of his vote. This is really all that was in evidence, and the only point the District Attorney made was that the oath was not administered to Hales; but if this was indicta ble why not indict J. J. Sharp, a leading Republican and a poll holder at the election, who stood by and made no suggestion ? Thft judge charged that, to convict, the jury must believe that the defend- ants not only made a mistake, but acted corruptly. And although the tie vote was caused by the poor negro doing what he thought right, the jury could -not agree on a verdict, one man stand ing out for conviction against eleven. The most striking thing about it all is that with all the charges brought by President Harrison as to our elections this innocent in stance is the only matter that can be singled out. What a compli ment ! The point we wish to call atten tion to is this which is worse, cor ruption or government intimida tion ? In trying to suppress cor ruption, which does not exist, the government rushes into intimidation and indicts a poor negro for exer cising his best judgment; the U. S. Commissioner actually hunted up the case by going around to Hales' house as Hales said. What an en gine of oppression all this would be if the Force bill were passed ! What an engine of oppression it is now ! Private, law-abiding citizens are in dicted if they decline to act as poll holders and also if they do act and then make an honest mistake. Verily we are between the devil and the deep blue sea. Tiie Democratic party to be suc cessful must win its way, as it has been doing rapidly of late, by the conversion of former Republicans. j Mr. Cleveland's policy won more converts to Democracy than had been won before in a generation, and the party man is acting un wisely when he sneers at the De mocracy of such men as young Russell and Hoar, and of such journals as the New York Times. It is from such sources that the Democracy must gain its converts, and they can be gained only by a lofty devotion to the principles of the party. Machinery alone will not win, and if we lrive away the growing independent vote the party cannot hope to be victorious. The papers say that Mr. Mills is sulking. When he came to choose a seat he took one on the back row near the door. He ex cused himself from serving on the committee to notify the President that the House was ready to pro ceed with business. When inter viewed after his defeat he said: "I have nothing to say to the press." We hope the Texas Democrats will elect him to the Senate to fill out the unexpired term of Mr. Reagan. He is the biggest man they have. L The chief business of the New York courts seem to be against al lowing a rich man to make his own will. Jose Sevilla, a wealthy Peruvian, bequeathed half a million dollars to establish in New York a home for poor girls. The courts have decided that the bequest is void. Rich men who desire to en dow libraries, establish homes, or do anything for the betterment of the poor are again taught that the only sure way is to become their own exe cutors, and carry their purpose into execution before their death. When it was thought that Wm. T. O'Dair would hold the balance of power in the New York As sembly, nobody could find out what he would do. Now that the Demo crats have a clear majority, he writes to Mr. Croker that he is a Democrat. The Republicans paid all- of O'Dair's election ex penses and are very indignant.

WHAT DEFEATED MR. MiLLs The candidacy of Mr. Mills r, ceived its chief strength from tact that he represented the Clevf land policy of fialit; i me cam. r wioice, the ex-President taking 0 part in the contest, though his preference v less mu. m. jl. Wilson, who pressed him as the ablest and be balanced man wit I. lm. st "m necame m contact during his term as Pre,i dent. It was his able and earnest championship of Tariff Reform that gave Mr. Mills his large vote Personally he is not as sunny tenj pered and as judicial as a man ought to be to become , leader, but in the point 0f ability of a high order and mas terly presentation of the tariff ques tion he stands , head and shoulders above his colleagues. Three things conspired to secure Mr. Mills' defeat : 1. All the elements of the party that doubt the wisdom of Mr. Cleyeland's re-nomination, were united to defeat Mr. Mills. Mr. Hill, Mr. Gorman and others worked earnestly for Crisi. Of course all the protectionists wer against him, but together these could not have compassed his de feat. 2. His speeches advocating that all financial and other legislation be ignored and tariff reform made the single issue, drove from him the support of such of the Congressmen who belong to the Alliance and oth ers who believe that a reform of our financial policy ought to go hand in hand with the reform of the tariff. 3. There was a fear, even on the part of his best friends, that Mr. Mills is not suited by tempera, ment to preside over the House, lie is impuUive and his intensity, born of courageous zeal, while making him an admirable and effective cam paigner, might have served to lesen his efficiency as Speaker. ne sioou ror a principle, but un- IT- A. T mm 1 fortunately, for his opponents stool for the same principle, though not one of them had enjoyed tnt oppor tunity to be so widely known as its exponent. We like Mr. Mills because he is a brave and manly fighter viho hits from the shoulder and rivither gives nor asks quarter. He rnakj warm friends and bitter enemies. One of the incidents connected with the contest that shows the devotion ' 1 " Willi. ! c TW. '. paign of 1892 upon the single i- a - ; of Tariff ReW m - of the friends of Mi:.
