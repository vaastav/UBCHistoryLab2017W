The State of Indiana calls upon you to bear a part in the glorious work of putting down the hlaveholdets' rebellion und saving the Union. Hitherto you have been compelled to remain at home or enli-t under the banners of other States. Many of your brethren, unable to repress their patriotic nrdor, have enlisted in the regiments of various States, w hile some w ere of the rank and file of the gallant 51tli MaseachusctH. which immortalized itself at Fort Wagner. Wherever the colored men of Indiana have fought in this war, they have shown that they partake of the same spirit of heroic valor that has ani mated Indiana's sons wherever they have met the foe in arms. The President of the Uuited States, in his late message, has reaf firmed his . proclamation of emancipation to your oppressed brothers; and ho guarantees that you and the officer who commands you in the field shall, when in the enemy's hands, be recog tuzed and treated as prisoners of war. Will you not march to the rescue of your suffering breth ren, and give to them iu fact the freedom which is now declared to be theirs of right? Every motive of philanthropy, honor, patriotism and self interest must urge you to respond promptly to the call that is now made upon you. It has been said of you that you do not possess the manly qualities that tit a people to enjoy and pre serve their liberty. You can now show to your detractors and the world the falsehood of the assertion, and place yourself in such a "t)j.ition that you pny ask and obtain from a grateful people a full recognition of your worth and rights as men. Come up then like men to the glorious work and march in folid phalaux against those who have oppo-cd you and are now opposing your rare. Strike f.r the Pnion and strike the fetters from tho slave. Show yourselves worthy soldiers, and the petty prejudices that weak and wicked men have cn dcavorc l to ex rite against you w ill be fori v er swallowed up in the gnti'u le of a nation that will owr and applaud your heroic deeds.

Thtt it is inter le i to keep the nrmy liere for a time, unless cii curuitances which are bot now calculated upon aric, is everywhere ap pareLt. The men are budding comfortable quarters, and preparing for winter. A rumor is current here'o day that Lee, under a Hag of truce lud forwarded a request to (Jmi. Mei'lc for nn armistice of thrte months dura tion. The Tribune's Washington special, dated De cember 10, says: The proclamation subjoined to tho President's message was written substantially in the form in which it was iticd pcveral weeks ago, and the President at the time sei iomdy thought of Issuing it before the meeting of Congress. Since its ap pearance questions have atiscnili oflicial quarters as to whether rebel prisoners in our hands, under the rank of Colonel, may not avail themselves of the amuesty offered. Some persons think, there fore, that the rebel prisoners in our hands would gladly ncccpt the terras of it. There is, as far as can be ascertained, a great disposition on the part of the members of Con gress to carry out the recommendations of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in Mr Chase's report, with regard to the increase of taxes on liquors and tobacco, though probably Congress will impose a heavier tax upon whisky than is firo posed perhips seventy-five cents or one dol ar per gallon. The avails of the draft, as f ir as ascertained, is C0.0O0 men. The navy has thirteen vessels iu pursuit of the Chesapeake. A special to the Herald, from Headquarters Army of the Potomac, December 'J, says: Three deserters from the 5th North Carolina volunteers, which regiment was on picket duty near Morton 'a Ford, came within our lines during last night. They say that the wholeof their regi ment only want an opportunity to desert, whrii they will gladly avail themselves of it. As con firmation of this, the regiment was not up yester day, and an Alabama regiment took their places. The rebel pickets ato nil along the south sido of the river from near the junction of tho Kapidan and Rappahannock to above Robertson River. From reliable information, we learn Lee's army occupies the following jni:-itions: Hill's corps around Orange C. II . where (Jen. Lee has his headquarters; Early's division near Somervillc Roads, at Morton's and Tob i ceo fords; Johnson's division at Mitchell's, Rrown's and Uermania fords. From tho dense volumes of smoke arising from the woods and batteries south of Raccoon and Morton's Ford, it is evident the cnemv is in force at those positions. The rebel authorities state that Lee hid over GO ,000 men In his campaign. He was certain of victory, should we have been rash enough to at tack him in his strong position. The enemy is building w inter quarters. New York, December 11. Richmond pipers of the Hth state that Oen. Stephen Lee reports from Mississippi that Gen.

A Charleston dispatch of the üth reports the destruction of the calcium light, at Fort Gregg by a shot from Moultrie, and says Sumter is con sidered Kife against all assaults. A special to the World dated Washington, De cember 10, pays : The agricultural report for the present month tdiows a deficiency in the corn crop of 140 mil lion bushels, and the grcut demands are such that to insuro supply it is intimated that all dis tillation of grain will be restricted in Ohio and Illinois, as is the case in Kentucky and Tennes see.

The agents of the steamer Chesapeake here have evidence that the cartro of the Chesapeake was owned exclu sively by American and Canadian merchants, and was not intended to run the blockade as was re ported by the St- Johns Globe. The rebel sympathizers here originated that re port to the prejudice of the British authorities; neither had t-hc ever been a Southern vessel or ever attempted to run the blockade. The Vice Consul at Halifax telegraphs the Collector that a steamer is at Shelbourne answer ingthe description Jof the Chesapeake. She at tempted to coal at Halifax last night.

The following, dii patch, dated De Moines. Iowa, December 11 rays: ' : The Supreme Court has this day given an opinion declaring the law allowing Didiers to vate con-titutional and valid. A Washington special states that Senator Brown of Missouri has arrived. Frauds in the Quartermaster Department at Alexandria will foot up to millions; they have beeu iu process fur seven months. Oiher ar rests are to bo made. .Mr. Chnie lleport. Notk. The following report of tb Secretary of the Treury wu unavoidihly omitted iu our edition of yetsTdry. The .subscription for the remaining 5-20' and deposits for temporary loans, therefore, must bo dire.-ted. All reiaonable expectation f means for the service of the current year, exceft from negotiations under the act of last se.-iou, the sum et tin to be looked for from these two sources have already been stated, and amount to $120, 

OÜ0.GOO. If this agcreu'ale be deducted from the amount to be provided by lo ins for the last reveu month of the current yeir, already shown to be $22G.l(iG,9'JJ, to be provided by negotiations un der the act of last session, and under some like act mud be provided iu some like manner, if necessary, the sum of $54, 1,57c estimated as likely to be required trom loans for the fiscal year G5. The act of last session authorized the loans supposed to be required for the fiscal years of IbGd and 1?G4, and of the amount required for the service of theiO two jears to the 1st of De cember, now current $ 1 50,000,000 in United State notes, and $50,0U0,0U0 by a loan for two years in five per cent, treasury notes, have al ready beeu provided under that legislation. The act is bo well conceived ami expressed tlut little other legislation for the loans of lfC4 and 1HG5 will be required than the application to those years of its leading provisions. It will doubtless be thought expedient this ses sion to authorize the borrowing in some form of $:U)0,000,000 lor the current and $GOO,000,000 lor the next fiscal year. Indeed the only modifi cation of the act of last session of the current and coming year seetni to be just to ascertain from time to time the amounts destroyed and lost, and to replace them by new issues. 21. The repeal of the existing limitation of the deposit loan to $100,000,000, and the substitu tion of a provisiou for a reserve equal in amount to half the pi posit. 3d. The permission of the negotiation of loans redeemable absolutely at pleasure or at pleasure after the time fixed, not more remote than forty ye its, and tha omission of the clause taxing the circulation of deposits, as being more appropriate to nn intcriinl revenue bill. It is hojied the other provisions of the last may be retained in the new loan act. Under such legislation the Secretary entertains little doubt of being able to obtain whatever funds will be needed through loans, at reasonable rates of in terest, for bonds or treasury notes. For a want of this confidence, however, he re lies much on the support to be given to the pub lic credit by the National Banking System and by the nationalization of the currency , there is, he thinks, no possibility of a permanently suc cessful administration of the finances under cir cumstances involving the creation of large debt, unless loans can bo effected as a medium of gen eral and equal credit throughout the country and not liable to variation iu qumtity or in value, except under the operation of national legisla tion and the general laws of trade. The Secretary asks the special attention of Congress to the proposition for a uniform rate of interest und the repeal of the section which con nects the issues of national currency in any de gree with Slate banks. The Secretary also rec com mends a pi o vision to be made by law for the deposit with national banks and also with the Treasurer and Assistant Treasurer, at such rates of interest or for such periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe of money paid into or invested under the orders of judicial courts, t is not impossible that in this way many mil lions would be placed in the Treasury at moder ate rates of iuterest. The Secretary refers to Congress tho question whether the duty on national currency and the leposits of national banking associations shall orrespond with the duties on other circulation nd deposits. He thinks, for the present at cast, some discrimination in favor of the national ssociations may be properly admitted, in consid ration of the indispensable importance of a na ional currency, not adapted, like Unitd States totes, to temporary emergencies, but permanent I its very nature and adequate to all demands of usiness, and capable at no distant period of be ng made equal to ami convertible into coin and herefore ius real representative and equivalent.

The large demand from abroad, and the rapidly Increasing home demand for Ut as the basis for circulation by National Hanking Atrociatious now organizing in all part of the coun'.ry, will, In a very hort period, absorb tLe balance. Sales have lately rained froia ten to t'.tecn millions weekly, frequently exceeding thre millions d.ily, and as it i well known tlut the Secretary of the Treas ury ha ample and unfailing resources In the lutie on Imports and internal Itevenues, and iu the tue of the Iuterest bearing Iiegal Tender Treasury Notes, It U al niot a certainty that he will nt ricd It necesarJ, for a long time to conic, to Keek a marktt for any other long or permanent Loans, THE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL OF WHICH ALU PAYAHLK IN C.OaM.
