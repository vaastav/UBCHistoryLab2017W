Hill Laughs Down a Sensational Story. CALLS IT "STUPID ROT." President of Great Northern Not Here to Build New Roads. Say* Prevent Trip !■ Purely One of Inspection—Denies Stories of Dif ferences With I. P. and S. P.— Seattle Should Reach Oot \ igor onsljr for the Oriental Trade— Mast Look Westward for Its Fu ture— Hetail Houses Driving Rail roads From U nter Front—Hill Hot Interested In Pacific Coast Co. "It Id stupid rot," said President James J. Hill in h.d private wr U*t evening when a.-K-.-d what foundation there was for the sensational stjry published In a Tacoma paper last week to the effect that he intended building a branch road to Ta conii and tnak*- of that place a terminal for the Great Northern. The toss of the head Mr. liill gave when uttering these words was strongiy sugges tive of impatience. "It is not worthy of being dignified with anything mure serious," he continued. "Any man w,%h a little reflection can see how senseless the projtosition is on the fate of it. There is no business between Seat tle. Tacoma and I'on land that the North ern Pacific cannot handle. The public his a very jxfor conception of the comparative ly small revenue these local roads in this section of the country produce, and If it were not for the ocean business that goes and come*, one road could hanile the busi ness of the whole country and not be crowd d. "The Urrst .\orihrrn bat never rvrn contemplated iurb a fool in LI mote HK 

KOIIIK to Tncoma and the publication of inch n atory IM nothlnK bat pare, unadulter ated »lu»h." The special car bearing railroad officials reached here at 10 o'clock yesterday morn ing. Mr. Hill said that his trip out heT<s was not for the purpose of building addi tional <oc*i# t but o«*» of ioap e.titm pure and simple. He had with him the leading officials of his road and lie was planning extensive improvements for next summer, principally the replacing of all wooden bridges and crossings with steel structures. A great deal of this work had already been done, but much remained to be done and the trip would determine that question. The matter of r- moving trestles and straighten ing the. revtd wherever possible was also being looked into and eleven miles of trestle work beyond Rock Islan 1 would removed and the road straightened an i buiit on solid ground. Denies) Trouble \\ ith Morsan. Mr. TI til brushed away with an emphatic negative all the stories of his alleged dif ferences with J. Piej-pont Morgan, the Northern Pacific or the combination to aff-ct his holdings in the Baltimore & Ohio. "These are matters that can never aff"ct the commercial interests of Seattle in this Northwest country. It Is vastly of more interest to t?*is coast what is doing out on the Pacific ocean than in Wall street, and your growth will be largely augmented by the increase of the commerce of the Pa cific ocean. That should be your field of operation and you want to turn your face* to the west for the future prosp< rity of this s -ti'.'n of the country. Ywir business with the eastern portion of the United Stab-a H something that you already have and Ss in the country; but thf* other you have yet to get; you are entitled to a large snare of It and you can get it by proper and systematic attention and following up of the matter.

WASHINGTON. Dec. 4.-The curtain will ring up tomorrow at noon on trie clos ing session of the Fifty-fifth congress. The war and the fruits of the American victory carry in their wake many prob lems which the national legislators must solve. But though many questions may press for solution, the brief space covered by this session, which expires by limitation on March 4, pre eludes the probability of much being accomplished beyond the pas sage of the regular mon» y budgets, the leg islation for the increase of the regular army, which the administration deems nec essary to the obligations imDosed upon the nation as a result of the war, an! probably the enactment of a law to give a permanent territorial government to the Hawaiian islands. This covers all the important legislation which the eongretvional leaders expo t to see enacted at this session. It is almost the unanimous sentiment of the members that no attempt should be made to legis late concerning the possessions acquired by the war with Spain at thi«* session. There are earnest advocates of the Nica rfiffiian canal who w If strive to secure the passage of a canal bill now, and in this they may be possibly successful, but nei ther it. nor ony one of the measures I ke the pooling bill, anti-scalpers* bill, etc., which have strong friends, will be allowed to interfere with the bills, the passage of which is deemed absolutely necessary to prevent an extra session.

It is necessary that the former should become a law Ixfore the holiday re cess, which, this year, is to be shorter than usual, and Chairman Cannon hop- s to see it through the house and into the senate before the end of this week. The Democrats of the house have not disclosed their position, but it is not be lieved they will seek to obstruct any ap propriation bill necessary for the mainte nance of ttie army now In the field. Should there be a disposition to open up and pro long a debate upon the conduct of the war, upon this bi!. it is safe to assume that the committee on rules will be invoked to bring in an order of closed debate.
