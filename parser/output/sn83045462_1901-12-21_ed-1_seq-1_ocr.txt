CASE lIN THE NOI'SE. Coelualo. Reached by Reisreneuta tive Pedu're of Maryland. Representative Pearre of Maryland, who represents the distric-t in which Rear Ad miral Schley lives and who has been tak ing an active Interest in the legislative attuation in the matter of the Schley Sampson controversy since the dec'sion of the court of inquiry. has come to the con clusion that no resolution or bill honoring Schlt-y can be passed or receive the con sideration of the House unless it also couples a proposition cornferring the same honor upon Rear Admiral Sampsor; Mr. Pt arre's joint resolution. wh~ch was Iintro duced in the House just before the holi day recess, recognizes this fact, and pro vides that the grade of vice admlral be created and that Rear Admirals Sch4e and Sampson and Capt. Clark be appoirftd to this grade for a period of ten years. Mr. Pearre said to a Star reporter ta he had been trying to ascertain the e~i ment of the House on this matter, and tW be3 befle ctedas obev et hoe Sul personally he was In favor of any legisla tion which would do justice to Schley. His proposition, which brings I Sampson and Clark. is merely conciliatorf, and done-for the purpose of securing action. If this joint resolution should be adopted Mr. Pearre believes that the findings of the court would in that act be officially discred ited. as the promotion of Rear Admiral Schley would be directly opposed to the re sult which would naturally follow the find ings of the court which criticised his ac tion. If the Navy Department ihould deal with Schley it could only . reduce him. whereas if Congress passed a measure pro moting him it would be held to be a crit icism of the court. The friends of Schley in the House seem to be determined to push the matter with the utmost vigor, and efforts will be made to have the va rious bills and resolutions which have been introduced on the subject taken up by the naval committee as soon as possible. In doing this the House committee on -ules will have to be confronted, and those who have been investigating the attitude of this committee believe that there is no disposi tion on the part of the dominant party In Congress to take up the Schley question unless Admiral Sampson be coupled with any measure which shall go through in the way of a promotion. MIR. RAYNER INDIGNANT. Characterises Secretary Long's Action as Tyrannical. BALTIMORE. Md., December 21.-Isidor Rtyncr. attorney general of Maryland, and counsel for Admiral Schley, when' shown the decision of Secretary Long today, de clared that "the whole proceeding is arbi trary and tyrannical." and manifested great surprise and indignation. "The court decided the case," said he, "without considering the testimony of Ad miral Schley and his witnesses, and Secre tary Long seems to have decided it without as much as permitting us to tile a reply to the protest filed by Admiral Sampson's at torneys. "This protest was filed late yesterday af ternoon. and just one hour ago we finished our reply to it and sent it to Washington. "Now. I understand that the Secretary has decided against Admiral Dewey and adverse to Schley's being in command at Santiago. and virtually in favor of Samp sen. without even permitting us to produce before him the conclusive proof, admitted at the hearing by consent, that the com mand practically and officially devolved upon Schley. The whole proceeding is too arbitrary and tyrannical for me now to dis cuss. I really wonder whether the people who live under free institutions will toler ate the exercise of such despotic measures. "You ask what our next step will be. I do not know, unless the President Inter venes. There is a power in the courts to compel the Secretary to file the dissenting opinion of Admiral Dewey whethtr he agrees with it or not. We will determine next week what proceEdings we will adopt."

DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTY PITTSBURG, Pa., December 21.-For the third time within seventy-two hours Pitts burg steel workers have been killed or maimed by terrific explosions. Following on the heels of the awful disasters at the Soho furnace of Jones &. Laughlins on Thursday and at the Black Diamond steel works yesterday, the city was shocked this morning by the report of another explosion at Singer-Mimick's West End plant of the Crucible Steel Company of America, in which seven men were scalded, one badly cut and twenty or thirty others slightly burned. f At 6:55 o'clock two of a battery of five boilers used to operate the sheet mill ex ploded with terrific force. Scalding water played havoc among the workmen, who had just started in for the day, while pieces of the boilers caused great destruction to the mill property. Of the seven men scalded two, it Is said, will die. List of the Injured. The Injured at the hospitals are: Charles Miller, engineer, aged twenty-six years, married; badly scalded about the head, face and chest.

About sixty men were at work in the sheet mill when the boilers let go. CHRISTMASTIDE IN ENGLAND. People of Quality Leaving the Cities for Country Seats. LONDON, December 21.-The king and queen, surrounded by many members ofkthe royal family, will spend Christmas at Sand ringham, where a shooting party will gather Monday. London is emptying fast of fashionable people, who are hurrying to the country to hold their festivities, and large parties are gathering at nearly all the great homes in the united kingdom. The South African war and the court's partial mourning seem in no way to have affected the nation's de termination to celebrate the season with more than usual zest. DISAPPOINTED IN ROSEBERY. Many Friends Expected a Political Speech at Swansea. LONDON, Decamber 21.-Those who an ticipated that Lord Rosebery would again discuss national politics on the occasion of the presentation to him of the freedom of Swansea today were disappointed. The mayor, in his welcoming address, did his best to draw the former premier by con gratulating him on the fact that he had left the "lonely furrow," but his lordship confined himself to allusions to municipal matters, especially dwelling on the respon sibility of taxpayers in controlling the ex penditure of city governments. COL. JOHN C. NOBLE DEAD. He Was the Nestor of Journalism in Kentucky. PADUCAH, Ky., December 21.-Colonel John C. Noble, known as the Nestor of Kentucky journalism, died today from old age.

H11 HER' INTERVIEW Probable Reprimand for Him and Dismissal for Maclay. FACTS OF ASSAULT CASE An exceedingly important conference was held at the White House today. Secretary Root and Secretary Hay, Senator Platt of Connecticut and Senator Lodge of Massa chusetts were present for part of the time with the President, but the two Secretaries remained after the others had gone. It is learned that the conference was for the purpose of deciding upon a course of ac tion toward Lieut. Gen. Miles and to Maclay, the author of the history of the Spanish war, whose severe criticism of Admiral -Schley brought the coul of in quiry. The Miles Interview. General Miles' connection with the Schley Sampson controversy has arisen because of an interview he gave out a few days ago while in the west, upholding Admiral Dewey and finding fault with the decision of the other admirals who composed the court. It Is ude.jrstood that General Miles, who was at the White House this morning, was asked whether he had given utterance to the eulogisms of Schley and criticism of the court, as reported, and that he prompt ly admitted that the words and sentiments attributed to him were correctly repro duced. The President, it is understood, took the position that General Miles ought to be reprimanded for taking part In the bitter discussion of the question that Is dividing the country, and finally issued instructions that steps in this direction be taken. The President's Position. The President's position is that the dis pute is a serious one and a grave one, and that it must not be kept alive by officials of the army or navy taking part. There fore he will reprimand any officer, no mat ter how high his position, who is known to publeily take part in the discussion. It is understood that some announcement will be made at the Navy Department this afternoon, and that Historian Maclay will probably be dismissed from the government service. The President Is Indifferent to any criticism of his act!on, telling his ad visers that this unfortunate dispute shall not be continued by the actions of offi cials of the government. Pushed Against the President. President Roosevelt, Capt. Cowles, his brother-n-law; Senator and Mrs. Lodge were walking on Massachusetts avenue on Thursday night on their way to Senator Lodge's home. While going up the ave nue they noticed a drunken man'in front of them reeling along in typical fashion. Just behind the party was a secret service de tective. The party overtook the drunkard, and as he reached a period of steadiness passed him without being molested. In a few minutes they reached Senator Lodge's home. : The party stopped for a few min utes to bid good-night, the President and Capt. Cowles not Intending to enter. The stop was long enough to allow the drunken man to catch up with the party. He almost ran into the President as he reeled up, but before he could do this the secret service man caught him and pushed hip Into the street. The man was sb drunk tnat he fell over into the street. After he got up he tried to cross Massachusetts avenue and fell twice more. The President was not in the least alarmed, having seen the condi tion of the man some time before Senator Lodge's home was reached. A Bountyto Cuban Sugar. The beet sugar, Louisiana sugar and other allied sugar interests having come to the concusion that President Roose velt is deeply and sincerely in earnest in his desire to see a substantial reduction in the duty on raw sugar coming to this coun try from Cuba, have sprung a new scheme that seeks to enable the reduction to be made in accordafice with the President's recommendations to Congress, but pre vents the sugar interests having to pay the freight. Henry Oxnard, the head of the beet sugar industry, had a conference with the President this morning and suggested the plan to the chief executive. This provides that Congress shall eact from Cuban sugar the full Dingley duty, but that this country shall return to Cuba a bounty of as much a pound as is deemed sufficient to encourage sugar growing in Cuba and put it on a paying basis. Mr. Oxnard declared that this scheme is entirely feasible, and said that detailed ideas would be submitteQ. to the President, who will give the subject close study. When It was suggested to Mr. Oxnard that the proposed bounty would be mighty hard to divide up into many parts to reach all the way down to the men who really grow the sugar he declared his belief that this could be arranged. "If the duty on Cuban sugar is reduced," said Mr. Oxnard, "the.-people will not be benefited. The sugar trust will reap all tle benefit and will make millions out of our generosity to Cuba. The price of sugar will not be reduced to consumers in the least. Therefore, wthy build up the sugar trust at the expense of the other sugar interests of the country? The best way is to let the whole American people pay the bounty and then divide It up among those who ought to get it." Young Roosevelt at Hoane. Theodore Roosevelt, jr., the President's eldest son, .has reached Washington from Groton, Mass., where he is attending school, and he will spend the holidays here.

Case of Deputy Auditor Dunhan. By request of Senator Foraker the 14esi dent a few days ago withdrew from the Senate the nomination of George P. Dun ham of Clinton county, Ohio. to be deputy auditor of the treasury for the Interior De Partment. Mr. Dunham was appointed dep uty auditor by Presideit McKinley about six months ago. He was a close personal friend of the dead President, and the ap pointment was largely personal with Presi dent McKinley. When President Roosevelt was making up the list of recess appoint ments. to nominate to the Senate he came across Mr. Dunham's name and sent it in with the others. It happens that Senator Foraker had never been supported with great warmth in his Ohio fights by Mr. Dunham. and so the nomination was with drawn to give Senator Foraker opportunity to study over what he would do. Senator Hanna has now taken the case up and has asked that the nomination be made when CQngress reassembles. Senator Hanna believes there will be an adjustment of the case. There are no charges against the character or efficiency of Mr. Dunham and the request for withdrawal was a personal matter with Senator Foraker.

Our negotiator will be Inst ructed to notify the American government that we are prepared to set aside the valua tiona which have been considered as the price asked and which have been judged unacceptable, and we offer to take as a basis and point of departure of the discus sion we solicit, and which we believe will not be refused, the figures and declarations contained in the conclusions of the ith mian commission's report.
