T NATIONAL KErUULICAN. ' - . t Monday, December 17, 18G0. THE AMBITION OP SOUTH CAROLINA. A correspondent at Charleston, of ft New YorV citjr paper, says : I " Any ofTeri of compromise in relation to the ' hi aver j question which, ruay hare place In the proceedings of Congrev, will prove utterly vain no far -as South Carolina is concerned. An) concessions to slavery will net meet her cose. She considers the anli slavery movement us , only one or her grievances. She wants freo ! trade, and l.e will have it. Shu ii hound to ' make her seaport ft great city. What Paris is , tv France that Charleston is to South Carolina t nnd Charleston will have her y. both in and I out of the Convention and the Legislature. Iflhcre ever was a case of sheer unit persist cnt " bambtoilement," as Colonel Benton would call It, If he was now living, it is the attempt to mislead the country Into the belief that any grievance in respect to slavery is the cause ol the nulliGcation of South Carolina. The undisputed thronology of affairs is, that I the negro was not taken up as a pretext, until . 1835, although General Jackson, as early as i 1833, predicted that the negro would perform that part; whereas nullification, with all the theories, and projects, and local ambitions, which constitute its vitality at this day, was in full blast in 1830-'32. It is to make Charleston the political and commercial metropolis, "the Paris" of the South, that tho Union is to be dissolved, and not to right tho wrongs of slaveholders. Undoubtedly, the fears and hopes and pas sions of slaveholders have been played upon, and will continue to be played upon, but they will see, in the end, and perhaps soon, that they aru really to be sacrificed to the local projects of a single city and a single State. VIRGINIA AND Mil. HUNTER. The position of Senator Hunter upon the question of dUuuion is very naturally the sub ject of constant ciiticism in this District and in Virginia. His Utter to the Richmond inquirer, as we have already had occasion t" cibserve, contnim i an elaborate presentation of the reasons whidrj urge Virginia to follow South Carolina, if that State should take tbe finul step of disruption, although Mr. Hunter professes to deprecate such action on the part of the Palmetto politi cians. Considering that those politicians would hardly push matters to extremity, if they did not count upon the ultimate co operation of the border slave Slates, and that they certainly would not push matters to extremities, if they did not count upon the resistance of the border slave States to any measure of Federal coer cion, it must be obvious that nothing could be better adapted to encourage them in their pres ent policy than just such a letter as Mr. Hun ter has written, and it is not treating that gen tleman with indecorum, or disrespect, to as sume that he understood perfectly what tbe ef fect of his letter would be. 1( his language in this letter had been his language in Senatorial debate, it would not be doing him injustice, from his known coolness and reserve, to have insisted that he knew and intended the exact results calculated to be produced by his words, and this inference becomes all the more irre sistible, from a letter, not responsive to any in quiry, or provocation, but coolly and volunta rily penned iu his own private leisure. It is not material to the present inquiry, to discuss the considerations which would or should control Virginia in a contingency which has not yet happened. So far as he has done so, Mr. Hunter may have argued well, or ill, but can there be any reasonable doubt ol the motive which prompted him to anticipate events, and to assure the nullifiers of South Carolina, in advance, that they might rely upon Virginia at last? Would a friend of the Union as it is, even if concurring with Mr. Hunter ns to what an eventual and possible necessity might require Virginia to do, be likely to en courage disunion, by admitting this necessity at the present time ? The conviction is gaining ground in Vir ginia, and rests, as it teems to us, upon im pregnable grounds, that Mr. Hunter has not changed since his election, as a Calhoun null i fier, to the office of Speaker of tbe Uonse, that his deprecation of the course of South Carolina is insincere, and that the only part of his re cent letter which exhibits his reul tendencies, is that iu which, with such zeal and eloquence and unmistakable relish, he portrays the gold en but imaginary prosperity which awaits the Commonwealth of Virginia detached from the Union of Washington and Jefferson and Madi son and Monroe. General Cusmtfo. Mr. Wilson's letter to this gentleman traces his whole career, as an abolition demagogue before he was elected to Congress, and an abolition agitator while in Congress. It even shows him, only two years ago, in the Massachusetts Legislature, denounc ing as " extraordinary " a claim in behalf of the Southern States, which he now pronounces it moral treason to resist. If a man could be killed off by proving his inconsistency and hy pocrisy, General Cushiug is effectually dis posed of; but he is made of material which will enable him to survive it all. MK.CuiTrLXDfc.s- In the Washington cor respondence of the New York Tribune of Sat urday, wo notice the following paragraph : " The Kentucky delegation have held a meet ing, and exchanged views fully and frankly. Mr. Crittenden will present the nroDosi'ion published in my dispatch a few days ago, as the ultimatum of the South, and, failing to obtain it or some equivalent from the North, he will justify Kentucky in cooperating with the se cession movement." We are enabled to say, with very great con fidence, that the writer of this paragraph has been misled, as to the views, both of Mr. Crit tenden and of the Kentucky delegation. Personal. Hon. Augustus Sthell. N. Y.. and Col. W, I). Lewis, Philadelphia, are at Wiuara3. Wm. Resack, Belgium, aud Hon. D. Mere tilth, Ky., are at the KIrkwood House. 

WILL UK RESIGN? The President was waited upon by a commit tee of his political friends, day before yesterday, with n request that he should resign. It was said to him, in so many words, that ho was never in his best days equal to an emergency, and that, nt aw rate, hn was now disaualified br ace. Tho interview of last Monday between th6 President and Messrs. Gwin nnd Midell, occur red ns reported, only tho actual language of Mr. Buchanan was much ttronger than what has been published. After stating to those Senators, that it was their advice which had involved himself nnd tho country in the pres ent difficulties, he ended by expressing his wish never to tee either of them again. In due time, after tbe actors in the enormi ties of the lost four years have thoroughly quar reled with each other, we shall get some " se el els of the prison houst," which will amaze the world. Tiie Secrktaut ok War. The Charleston papers publish the following as a part of a let tir to Governor Gist; from a distinguished source : " WAsmxoTON-, Dec. 5, 1860. "Tear Sir: I have just had a a conversation with' the Secretary ot War. He says: 'You may say to the people of South Carolina, there will be no more troops sent to the forts at Charleston. I will icsign before it shall be done." The Secretary of State, on tho other hand, has resigned because it was not done. Nobody doubts here now that Mr. Keitt was justified in the public statement which hemado some weeks ago, that the President had com mitted and pledged himself to the nullifiers not to oppose any resistance to their treason. And the hope that Mr. Buchanan will break away from these pledges grows fainter and fainter with each succeeding duy. 

NOR1H CAROLINA. The Charlottes dlo Obsarrcr snj s : " We tell our North Carolina Iriends, that if this Union should be disolud, (and we have scnrcelv a hopu that it will not be,) the very lust thing that they should do would by to unite her with these cotton SUtcs, tho chief one of whu.li (South Carolina) is this day less ultaehed to North Carolina than New York or Pentisvlvaiinia is. No, no! If we have to eparate Irom the Norih, let us either set up fur ourselves or join the conservative border States, Marvl.inrl, Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee. With these we have interests in common, and feeling in common. But a Con federacy of the cotton Slates would reopen the slave trade, in suite of the interests and feel ings of the 'border Slates,' and would shape all its legislation to the advancement of the cot ton interests. 1 he tnriff policy ol the United States, against which South Carolina wanted to nullify, was nothing to what tho farming Slates would experience at the hands of 'king cotton.' Preserve us from such friends! who openly tell us that they intend to force us to join them or to emancipate our slates. If we are freemen, we will tell 4hera that we will do neither the one nor-the other.'' THE CRISIS COMMITTEE. The Crisis Committee sat four hours on Fri day, and then adjourned over till Monday. Mr. Kellogg, of Illinois, spoke nearly two hours to disabuse erroneous impressions concerning the Republican platform and purposes, and to show that Mr. Lincoln's record and speeches exempted him from any suspicion of an inten tion or desire to interfere with slavery where it existed by law. Mr. Corwin then addressed the committee in a conciliatory speech, and closed by present ing a proposition substantially to the effect, that the Territories should be allowed to elect all their own officers, which arc now appointed by the President, and that, upon attaining pop ulation enough to authorize one member of Congress, they should be admitted as States with or without slavery, us they might elect. Mr. Rust, of Arkansas, propofed to amend by a provision that slavery might go into the Territories, and be protected there during their Territorial condition. Mr. Curtis introduced a series of resolutions, declaring secession to be revolution, and in volving war, and pledging the committee to sustain the Union ut all hazard'. This led to animated expression from South ern members, who declared, if conciliation was the object, it could not be attained by such means. Mr. Curtis then withdrew the resolutions temporarily, but- they will probably he renewed ' on some future occasion, m.d the sense of the committee tested. Some general but unimportant discussion fol lowed, aud tho subject was postponed for an other meeting. It is very evident, from all the indications, that the extreme South intend to demand protection for slavery in the 'I errito ries as a sine qua non, and that, failing to ob tain it prompily, the Gulf States will secede, with the expectation, however, of being invited to return, under new guaranties, or with what they call reconstruction. This is the programme, in plain term", however disguised it may be by evasions or generalities. The city has been considerably excited the two luit days by rumors that President Bu chanan, Secretary Thompson, and General Scott, had resigned their positions, So far as we have been able to ascertain, there is no foundation for these report:. We understand that the President has re solved to appoint Attorney General Black to the vacant Secretaryship of State, and that his nomination will be cent to the Senate to-day. Secretary Thompson leaves this morning, to attend tho Charleston Convention. Moses Kelly, tbe Chief Clerk, will act as Secretary during tbe absence of Mr. Thompson. We are pleased to annouce that Postmaster General Holt aud Second Assistant Postmaster General Dundas were both muc'l better last evening. The examination iu the rase of tbe slave barque Cora was resumed Friday afternoon, before United States Commissioner Morell, and three witnesses were examined. Activity of the Afiucah Slave Trade. The Navy Department received dispatches Friday morning from the African squadron, stating that the steamer San Jacinto had cap tured the brig Bonito, with n cargo of seven hundred and fifty slaves. Commander Inman reports gi eat activity on the part of vessels en gaged in this inhuman traffic. A large num ber of suspicious looking vessels are constantly seen hovering about in various localities, evi dently watching an opportunity to secure car goes and escape without detection.

Report says that the President is no way fa vorable to Mr. Clayton, the present assistant Secretnry of tho Treasury, holding on to that position, and has shown his want of confidence in him by departing from the usual custom, and requesting Secretary Toucey to take charge of the Treasury Department after the resigna tion of Mr. Cobb. It is probable that Mr. Clayton may become the sensation and seces sion editor of the Constitution. The thermometer was seven degrees below zero, nt Montreal, on Friday last Col. Andrew Neil, of Galveston, Texas, made a bet of $10,000, a few days previous to the election, that Breckinridge would not get 17,500 majority in Texas. Of course, he has lost.

Harney wished to declare martial law, but Gov. Medary would not con sent, preferring that the U. S. Marshal should make the arrest, and the prisouers be tried by Territorial law. A special dispatch to tbe Republican, from Independence, sajs that Adson, wounded, and Ball, who escaped from Walker's, were found yesterday, secreted in the woods.

Hannah Carroll, a negro woman, about ninety-six years oi age, uieu suuuemy 01 ouopiexy at ner resi dence in New York, on Thursday afternoon. Deceased, it appeared, was a native of Wash ington, I). C, and is said to have acted as cook for General Washington during the Revolu tionary war. For upwards of twenty years she has been residing with a family named Williams, at the above number. Aunt Hannah, as she was called, was well known, and received pecu niary aid from the first families in the city. She boasted of her acquaintance with tbe oldest and most respectable citizens, and went regularly in tbe summer season to the St. Nicholas and other hotels, to see some of her old friends from the South. A New York correspondent says: "Mrs. Anderson, wife of Major Anderson, in com mand nt Fort Moultrie, has called upon the President within a few days, and demanded that ho increase the force at that place, or slio will take his neglect to do so as an intentional and wicked sacrifice of her husband's life, who, she declares, will never surreuder the place, out raiuer itm iu us uiriuuce. No Pliiversion of the Am to the Scf febehs of Kansas. We wish our Republican exchanges at the East would reiterate the fact that no arms or ammunition whatever have been sent to Montgomery from the East, marked as "relief goods," "relief for Kansas," nor anything of the kind. If he and his men have arms, they are such as have been in the Territory for years. Neither have any provis ions been sent to Montgomery or his men. Hardly a pound of the relief provisions has been sent to Linn county at all, although the people of that county are as deserving of as sistance as any in the Territory. The report that the contributions of the East have been per verted to tbe supply of Montgomery is utterly false, and is circulated by pro-slavery and Dem ocratic journal1! to prevent aid from from be ing extended to our suffering people. Law icnee Republican. Relief Provisions Faiuxo. We under stand that from 100 to 160 teams from tho in terior are now in Atchison, waiting for sup Sliest, which hare given out, A recent acci ent (the breaking of a bridge) on the Hanni bal and St. Joseph railroad, hat detained some of the provisions which were' en route for the Territory. The infamous falsehood of Judge Williams, that, under the guise of " relief goods," supplies, arms, Ac, were being sent to Montgomery, has been made a pretext by some of the railroad companies for raising tbe freights, which caused some embarrassment It is hoped, however, that recent contributions will soon arrive, so that 'tho relief committee will not be obliged to send any of the needy empty away. Rut If now, In the first days of December, difficulty begins to be realized in supplying the wants of the destitute, what shall we see in February or March, in May or June? God only knows what is to become of our peo ple. Jxturence Republican. From Panama. By tho North Star, we learn that the Chilian Congress had extended the extraordinary powers of the President until the 30th September next Both Houses had sanctioned the bill by which authors or abettors of mutinies, riots, or seditious movements, are jointly answerable for the losses and damages caused thereby. Congress has also sanctioned the project S resented by the Government for sending a linister to the Court of Rome. The Arancanian Indians hare again made a hostile movement, and, to the number of be tween 2,000 and 3,000, were advancing on Aranco, Lota Cornenel, and Santa Juana. Im mediately on receiving intelligence of the move- inent, the Government Bent the steam frigate Esmeralda with 300 troops to tbe scene ol tbe outbreak. More troops were to follow. The dates from Callao are to November 14. Mr. Clay would leave in a few days, in the Wyoming, homeward bound. The revised Constitution of Peru has been accepted, sworn to, aud published. Congress has in secret session conferred ex traordinary powers upon President Costilla, with reference to the present difficulties with Bolivia. It is therefore thought by mauy that tfastilla will not content himself by simply overthrowing Dr. Linares, but will probably try to annex Bolivia to Peru. A letter from Lima says that Castilla is to raise an urmy of 30,000 men to operate against Bolivia. The letter adds : "It is the general opinion of the people who know both tho Bolivian and Peruvian armies, thut the foiraer will gain the victory iu the coming struggle ; at least, if old Gen. Brown commands the Bolivians, as it is said, and Castilla the Peruvians, the latter are sure of a sound thrashing." TUB 

TREASURY. The condition of the Treasury is far wore than is understood by the public, or disclosed in the weekly statements. It has not been so bad ut any time since 1814, when Treasury uotcs were sold at 25 per cent, discount Over drafts amounting to $250,000 have been made on New York, nnd orders have been dispatched to St Louis to transfer $300,000 sent there to pay army and other demands, to New York, to satisfy these drafts. There are only a few hun dred thousand dollars in all the depositories, scattered in small sums, and thus rendered un available at any particular point. The Mint fund, which is rarely touched for any other purpose, is exhausted, and there are warrants amounting to $2,000,000 on the Secretary's table, which are not signed, because they can not be paid. Mr. Thomas will take immediate steps to secure the payment of interest on the public debt, due on the 1st of January, if all other demands have to be temporarily post poned. Soon after Mr. Cobb came into office, ho re deemed the Government loan at a premium of 16 per cent., to relieve the plethoric Treasury, and the day he went out it was sold at 15 per cent, discount. So much for Democratic ability and economy. A'. Y. Tribune Cor.
