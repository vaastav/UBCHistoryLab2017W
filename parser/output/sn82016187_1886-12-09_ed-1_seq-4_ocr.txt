It is written in the plain, straightforward style cuBtomary in Mr. Cleveland's composi tions, and is an improvement on his veto messages in that it contains no attempts to be oithcr witty or sarcastic. Mr. Clevoland has some talent for matter-of-fact statement, but he never appears to so little advantage as whoa he abandons tho safo ground of business-like prose and tries to bo humorous or scathing at the oxponso of disabled sol diers. The message begins with an announce ment that we arc at peace with our neigh bors, and likely to remain so, since tho mattors of dispute are few, rolativoly un important, and likoly to be amicably set tled. He deprecates "the cruel treatment of the inoffensive Chiucso" in tho far "West, but wants a restriction of immigration, and ex pects that tho Chinese Government will meet us halfway in this matter. He blames tho Sonate for not agreoing to his mothod of sotlling the fisheries dispute; claims that in spite of this he was able to sooiire some concessions for our fishermen, but says that tho action of the Dominion officials has boon irritating and dangerous. Hohopas that a satisfactory settlement of this long-standing cause of serious dispute will be arrivod at boforc Congress adjourns. He dwolls upon tho importance of main taining our paramount influence in the Ha waiian Islands, and urges that the treaty now bofore the Senate to continue the pres ent arrangement with the islands for seven years more bo ratified. He wants more substantial assistance given tho struggling Republic of Liberia, and recommends that wo present her with one of our small naval vossols, to be cm ployed in the protection of her coastwise rovenues. The execution of Reciprocity Convention of 1883 with Mexico is strongly recom mended. The claim of Mexico to the right to pun ish any foreigner found in tho Republic for any ofibnse against n Mexican, no matter whore committed, is declared to be danger ous and wholly inadmissible: In tho case of Moxico thero aro reasons es pecially strong for perfect harmony In the mutual oxoroise of jurisdiction. Nature has made us irrevocably neighbors, and wisdom aud kind fooling should mako us friends. The overflow of capital and enterprise from tho United States is a potent factor in assisting tho dovuloptnout of tho resources of Mexico, and in building up tho prosperity of both couu trics. To assist this good work all grounds of ap prohonsion for the security of person and prop orty should be removed; and 1 trust that in the interests of good neighborhood tho statute ro forred to will bo so modified as tooliminato tho present possibilities of dangor to tho peace of tho two countries. The Dutch Government having protested against the discrimination against Sumatra tobacco, he pronounces against the unwis dom of legislation appearing to have a spe cial national discrimination for its object, which, although unintentional, may give rise to injurious retaliation. Of the Samoan incident he says: Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands havo during the past few years been a sourco of considerable embarrassment to the thrco Rovornmonts Gormany, Great Britian aud tho United States whoso relations and extra-territorial rights in that important group aro guar anteed by treaties. The weakness of tho na tivo administration and tho conflict of oppos ing interests in the Islands havo led King iuaucioa to sock alliance or protection in some one quarter, regardless of tho distinct engage ments whereby no one of tho threo treaty powers may acquire any paramount or exclu sive intorost. In May last Maliotoa offered to place Samoa under tho protection of tho United Statos, and tho late Cousul, with out authority, assumed to grant it. The proceeding was promptly disavowed and tho ovorzcalous official recalled. Special agonts of tho threo governments havo been deputed to examine the situation in the Islands. With a ohaugo in the representation of all threo powers, and a harmwiious understanding bo tweon them, tho peace, prosperity, autonomous administration, and neutrality of Samoa can hardly mil to no secured. Of our relations with Spain he says : It appearing that tho Government of Spain did not extend to tho flag of the United Statos in tho Antilles the full mcasuro of reciprocity requisite undor our statute for tho contiuuauco of the susponsion of discriminations against the Spanish flag in our ports, Iwas constrained in Ootobor latt to rescind my predecessor's proclamation of February 14, 1631, permitting such susponsion. An arrangement was, how cvor, speedily reached, and upon notification from tho Govornmout of Spain that all differ ential treatmont of our vessels and their car goes, from the United States or from any foreign country, had been completely aud absolutely relinquished, I availed mysolf of the discretion conferred by law, and issued on tho 27th of October my proclamation, declaring reciprocal suspension in the United Utatcs. It is most gratifying to bear testimony to the earnest bpirit in which the Government of tho Queen liogont has mot our efforts to avert the initia tion of commercial discriminations and repris als, which arc ever disastrous to tho material interests and tho political goud will of the coun tries thoy may affect. The profitable development of tho largo com mercial exchanges between tho United States and the Spauibh Antilles is naturally an object of solicitude. Lying close at our doors, and finding hero their main markets of supply and demand tho welfare of Cuba and Porto lllco and their production and trade, are scarcely loss important to us than to Spain. Thoir com mercial and financial movements arc so natu rally a part of our nystom that no obstacle to fuller aud freor intercourse should be permitted to exist. The standing instructions of our rep resentatives at Madrid and Havana have for years been to leave no offort un essayed to fur ther those ends, and at no time has tho equal good doairo of Spain boon more hopefully mau ifostcd than now. Tho Government of Spain, by removing the consular tonnage foes on cargoos shipped to tho Antilles, aud by reducing passport fees, has shown its recognition of the needs of less tram meled intercourse. Passing over briefly Bome minor questions in discussion with Turkey and Venezuela, he renews recommendations in his last annual message that tho existing legislation on cit izenship and naturalization be revised, and that a central bureau be established for the registration of all naturalizations. He sug gests an amendment to the extradition laws to permit the free passage across our terri tory of criminals surrendered by one power to another, and that authority be conferred I on tno bccreiary of Stale to issue a certifi cate in case of an arrest for the purpose of THE 

NATIONAL TRIBUNE: extradition, to the officer before whom the proceeding is pending, showing that a requi sition for the surrender of the person charged has been duly made. Such a certificate, if required to bo received before the prisoner's cxamiuation, would prevent a long nnd ex pensive judicial inquiry into a charge which the foreign Government might not desire to press. Ho trusts that Congress will give due at tention to the international copyright ques tion, and that " tho just claims of authors, so urgently pressed, will bo duly heeded." The abolition of the duty on foreign works of art is recommended, because American artists studying abroad are unpleasantly affected by it. The payment of sufficient salaries to our consuls to secure and retain good men, and the institution of a proper system of consular inspection is urged. "When it comes to the question of finances the President reaches tho trying portion of his message, and it must bo admitted that he speaks with no uncertain phrases. Ho is in favor of a radical reduction of tho in- como of tho Government, and that at once. He presents a summary of the statistics in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, aud then says : Tho income of tho Government, by its in creased volume and through economies in its collection, is now moro than ovor in oxcess of public necessities. Tho application of tho sur plus to tho payment of such portion of tho pub lic debt as is now at our option subject to ex tinguishment, if continued at tho rato which has latoly provailod, would retiro that class of indebtedness within less than ono year from this date. Thus a continuation of our present revenue system would soon result in tho receipt of an auuual income much greater than neces sary to meet Government expenses, with no indebtedness upon which it could bo applied. Wc should then bo confronted with a vast quan tity of money, tho circulating medium of tho people, hoarded in tho Treasury when it should be in their bauds, or wc should bo drawn into wasteful public extravagance with all the cor rupting National demoralization which follows in its train. But it is not tho simple existence of this sur plus aud its threatened attendant evils, which furnish tho strongest argument against our present scalo of Federal taxation. Its worst phase is tho exaction of such a surplus through a perversion of tho relations botweon the peo plo and their Government, nnd a dangorous doparturo from tho rules which limit tho right of Federal taxation. Good Government, and especially tho Gov ernment of which every American citizen boasts, has for its objects tho protection of every person within its caro in tho greatest liberty consMeut with tho good order of so ciety, aud his perfect security iu tho enjoyment of his caruings, with the least diminution for public needs. When more of tho peoplo's sub stauco is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of tho Government nnd tho cxpenso of its eco nomical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of tho fun damental principles of a free Government. The message embodies quito a little essay on the tariff. It assumes that the people of the country demand a revision of the tariff laws, and declares that Congress should take such action on the subject as will reduce the receipts of the Treasury to correspond with the public expenses. It recommends that tho reduction of duties on imports be not made suddenly, and with a view to justice both to the manufacturer and tho consumer. The President intimates that if the manu facturers would accept some reasonable plan of reduction of duties, it might avert abrupt and less favorable legislation at some future time. He frames an argument to show that the preseut high tariff is not a good thing for the laboring classes, and is especially onerous to the farmers. On this point ho says : But our farmers and agriculturists those who from tho soil produce tho things consumed by all aro perhaps moro directly and plainly concerned than any other of our citizens, in a just and careful system of Federal taxation. Thoso actually ongaged in and more remotely connected with this kind of work, numbor nearly ouo-half our population. Nono labor harder or moro continuously than thoy. No enactments limit their hours of toil, and no interposition of tho Government enhances to any great extent the value of their products. And yet for many of tho necessaries and com forts of life, which the most scrupulous economy enables them to bring into their homes, and for their implements of husbandry, they arc obliged to pay a price largely increased by an unna tural profit, which, bj' tho action of the Gov ernment, is given to tho more favored manu facturer. I rccommond that, keeping in view all these considerations, tho increasing aud unnecessary surplus of national income annually accumula ting, be released to tho people, by an amend ment to our rcveuuo laws which ahall cheapen tho prico of the necessaries of life and give frceror cntranco to such imported materials as by American labor may be manufactured into marketable commodities. Nothing can be accomplished, however, in tho direction of this much-needed reform, un less the subject is approached in a patriotic spirit of devotion to the interests of the entire country and with a willingness to yield soino- tmng lor tno public good. Passing to the public debt, the reduction for the fiscal year ending Juue 30 List is stated at $14,551,043. Our total interest bearing debt is announced to bo $1,153,1 13,- 112 on Nov. 1. Tlic President clearly indicates his di3liko of the silver dollar, and proceeds to give it a black eye. In regard lo the subject of coinage, be says: I havo seen no reason to chango the views expressed in my last annual message on tlic subject of this compulsory coinago, aud 1 again urge its suspension on all the grounds contained in my former recommendation, ro-enforced by the significant iflfcrcase of our gold oxportatious during tho last year, as nppcars by tho com parative statement herewith presented, and for tho further reasons that tho moro this currenry is distributed among the people tho greater becomes our duty lo protect it from disaster; that wo now havo abundance for all our needs, and that there seems but littlo propriety in building vaults to storo such currency when the only protenso for its coinage is tho neces sity of its uso by tho peoploas a circulating medium. For the army no rccommcndalious are made except that a system of examination of officers before promotion, as now exists in the Navy, is advocated. Ho urgently presses upon Congress the necessity for coast defense, and says tho work of fortifying our unprotected seaboard cities should begin immediately. He says that it has been decided to keep the Apaches, captured recently, in prison, rather than to try them for murder, owing to the understanding with which they sur rendered. He commends the suggestions of Secretary Whitney relative to the building of a navy.' He recommends that the contracts for steel armor and guns for both army and navy be consolidated, so as to bo able to offer suffi 

WASHINGTON rD. 0., THURSDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1886.' cient inducements to our manufacturers to prepare the plant for the production of thi3 class of war material. In the matter of the postal service wc are assured that wc have the best establishment in the world. The 'reduction of the rate of postage which caused a -deficiency recently it appears is soon lo be made up by the ex tension and increaso of the business, so that it is already proved that cheap postage is a success in this country. The President recommends the extension of the free-delivery system and the creation of another Assistant Postmaster-General. Perhaps the following maybe construed as as declaration in favor of mail subsidies: I suggest that as distinguished from a grant or subsidy for tho mero benefit of any lino of trade or travel, whatevor outlay may be re quired tosccuro additional postal service neces sary and proper aud not othorwiso attainable, should bo regarded as within the limit of le gitimate compensation for such service. As to the Indians, he renews his recom mendation of last year for a Commission as a supplemental agency in their civilization. Ho recommends the allotment to them of land in severalty under a homestead law. The President animadverts against large land owners, and goes on to say: , I recommend tho repeal of tho pre-emption and lirabor-culturo acts, and that tho homo stcad law3 bo so amended a3 to bettor sccuro compliance with their requirements of resi dence, improvement and cultivation for tho period of livo years from date of entry, without commutation or provision for speculative relin quishment. I also recommend the repeal of tho desert-land laws unless it shall bo tho pleasuro of tho Congress to so amend theso laws as to render them less liablo to abuses. As the chief motivo for an invasion of the laws, nnd tho principal cause of their result iu laud accumu lation instead of land distribution, is the facility with which transfers arc made of tho right in tended to bo secured to settlers, it may bo deemed ndvisablo to provide by legislation somo guards and checks upon the alienation of homestead rights and lauds covered thereby until patents issue. Last year an executive proclamation wa3 is sued directing tho removal of fencos which inclosed tho public domain. Many of theso havo been removed in obedienco to such order; but much of the public laud still remains within tho lines of thoso unlawful fences. Tho ingenious methods resorted to in order to con tinue theso trespasses and tho hardihood of tho pretenses by which iu somo cases such inclo3 urcsaro justified, aro fully detailed in tho re port of the Secretary of tho Interior. Tho removal of tho fences still remaining which inclose public lauds will bo enforced with all tho authority and menus with which tho executive branch of tho Government is or shall bo invested by the Congress for that purpose. The President dwells at gTeat length on the subject of pension legislation, and tells tho public, rather than "the" Congress doubtless, his viow3 uboat what should bo done for the veterans. He "gets aboard" in the following style: It seems to mo that no one can examine our pension establishment and its operations with out boing convinced that through its instru mentality justice can bo very nearly dono to all who aro entitled under present laws to tho pension bounty of tho Government. But it is undeuiablo thafccasc3 oxist, well en titled to relief, in which the Pension Bureau is powerless to aid. The really worthy cases of this class aro such as only lack by misfor tuno the kind or quantity of proof which tho law and regulations of the Bureau require, or which, though their merit is apparent, for some othor reasou cauuot bo justly dealt with through general laws. Theso conditions fully justify application to the Congress nnd special ouactmcuts. But resort to tho Congress for a special pension act to overrule tho dclibcrato aud careful determination of tho Ponsion Bu reau on the merits or tosccuro favorable action when it could not be expected undor tho most liberal execution of general laws, it must bo admitted, opcus tho door to tho allowance of questionable claims and presents to tho Legis lative aud Executive branches of the Govern ment applications concedcdly not within tho' law and plaiuly devoid of merit, but so sur rounded by sentiment aud patriotic fooling that thoy aro hard to resist. I suppose it will not bo denied that many claims for pension aro made without merit and that many havo been allowed upon fraudulent representations. This has boon declared from the Pension Bnreau, not only iu this, but in prior Administrations. Tho usefulness and tho juatico of any system for tho distribution of pensions depend upon tho equality aud uniformity of its operation. It will be seen from tho report of the Com missioner that thero are now paid by tho Gov ernment 13L different rate3 of pension. Ho estimates from the bc3t information ho can obtain that 0,000 of those who have served iu tho army aud navy of tho United States aro now supported, in wholo or in part, from public funds or by organized charities, exclustvo of thoso in Soldiers' Ilomca under the direction and control of tho Government. Only 13 per ccut. of thc3o are pensioners, while of tho en tiro number of men furnished for tho Iato war something liko 20 per cent., including their widows aud relatives, have been or now are in receipt of pensions. Tho Amorican people, with a patriotic and grateful regard for our ex-soldiers too broad and too sacred to be monopolized by any special advocatc3 aro not only willing but anxious that equal aud exact justico should bo dono to all honest claimants for peusious. Iu their sight the fricndlcs3 aud destitute- soldier, do pendcut on public charity, if othorwiso enti tled, has precisely the same right to share in tho provisions made for tuoso who fought thoir country's battles as thoso better ablo, through, friends aud influence, to push their claims. Every ponsion that is granted under our pres ent plan upon any othor grounds than actual service aud injury or disease incurred iu such sorvicc, and every instance of the many in which pensions are increased on other grouuds than the merits of the claim, work an injustice to tho bravo and crippled, but poor and friend less soldier, who is entirely uegtcctcd or who must be content with tho smallest sum allowed uuder general laws. Thero aro far too many neighborhoods in which nro found glaring cases of inequality of treatment iu tho matter of pensions ; and they are largely duo to a yieldiug iu the Teusiou Bureau to importunity on tho part of those, other thau tho pensioner, who aro especially interested, or they arise from special acts passed for tho benefit of individuals. The mcu who)fought side by sido should stand side by sido when thoy participate in a grateful Nation's kind remembrance. Every cousideration'of fairness and justice to our ex-soldiers, and tlic protection of tho patri otic instinct of our citizens from perversion and violation, point to tno aupptiou el a pension system broad and com prchensi ve enough to cover overy contingency, add which shall mako un necessary an objcctiouablo volume of special legislation. As long as wo adhcr(s to thpprinciplo of grant ing pensions for service, and disability as tho result of tho servico the allowanco of pensions should bo restricted to auos presenting these features. Every patriotic heart responds lo a tender consideration for thoso who,) having served their country longaudwcllaro reduced to destitution and dependence, not as an incident of their servico, but with advancing ago or through sickness or misfortune. We aro all tempted by the contemplation of sucn n condition to supply- relief, and aro often impatient of tho limita tions of public duty. Yielding to no ono in tho desire to indulge this fccliug of considera tion, I cannot rid myself of tho conviction that if these cx-soldicrs aro to be relieved, they and their causo are entitled to the benefit of an enactment, under which relief may be claimed as a right, add that such relief should bo granted under the sanction of law, not in evasion of it; nor should such worthy objects of care, all equally entitled, bo remitted to the unequal operation of sympathy, or the tender mercies of social nnd political influence with their un just discriminations. The discharged soldiers and sailors of tho country are our fellow-citizens, and interested with us in tho passago and faithful execution of wholesome laws. Thoy cannot bo swerved from their duty of citizouship by artful appeal lo their spirit of brotherhood bom of common peril and suffering, nor will thoy exact as a test of dovotion to their welfare a willingness to neglect public duty in their behalf. The President recommends the passage of an inter-State commerce bill, and renews the recommendation of a special message for powers of labor trouble arbitration for the National Labor Bureau. The passage of some law looking to the check of plcuro-pneumonia is urged. The President give3 Civil Service Reform and the law a ringing commendation, urges Congress to see to it that the supplies are voted and the salaries of the Commissioners increased, with a view to the perfection and perpetuation of the new order of things. Tho message was generally commended by thoso who like the President, and de nounced as a political screed by those who do not like him. The "Western members of Congress object to his views on the land question. The Republicans denounce his suggestions on the tariff. The Democrats of the old school do not liko the paragraph abont Civil Service, and all unite in pro nouncing his essay on pension legislation a long rail to mend a bad breach in his fences. THE 

PRESIDENT ON TENSIONS. The part of the message relating to pen sions will he read with deep interest by all our friends. The language the President uses is not so perspicuous and unmistakable as in some other parts of tho message it is plain that he is wrestling with an idea that ho has not yet mastered but he has cer tainly seen a light. The storm that followed his pension vctos has had its effect. The earnestness and solidarity of the soldiers in the recent elections has been heeded. The praise of the few soldier-hating papers and politicians could not conceal the fact that the mass of the people were deeply offended at the sneers and gibes of the Chief Executive against tho3C to whom the Nation owes so much. This has led the President to a more care ful study of tho questionthan he had be stowed upon it when he sent ont his hasty and ill-considered vetos. That he ha3 given much attention to the recommendations of the National Pension Committee is apparent both in the thought and phraseology of his utterances. He has also undoubtedly cained some ideas from a moro or less thorough perusal of Tue National Tribune. Had his study of these sources of correct informa tion on matters relating to thcEoldiers been more thorough, he would havo a stronger grasp upon the subject, and be able to ex press himself more lucidly. As it is, there is much ground for hope. He is approaching the point of accepting the recommendations of the National Pension Committee, and the drift in that direction manifested in the message will be such an encouragement to Congressmen as will be of the greatest value in helping secure a ma jority in the House for a bill lo embody those recommendations into law. One of the lions in the way at the last session was the fear that the President would send back any pen sion bill that was passed with a sarcastic veto message and a Pharisaical posing of himself as superior to the Congressmen who passed it in discernment, public honesty and courage of conviction. After what he has now said the danger of this is well-nigh passed. The comments that will he made on thl3 portion of the message will convince the President that he can make no mistake by a strong liberalization of his views on pen sions. The heart of the whole people is with the old soldiers, and they can forgive many things rather than excuse the consign ment of a single broken-down veteran to tho tender mercies of the poorhouse. "We have great faith in Mr. Cleveland's entire conversion to the cause of the soldier. no has now traveled far on the right road, and our earnest prayer to him is the old in junction to the Knights of Malta: "Go forward : be just and fear not." A UIO 

DAY'S 1T011K. The immense amount of business which was transacted iu tho Pension Bureau on the 30th of November has attracted wide-spread attention. No such a day's work was ever done in the history of the Bureau, and it w.T3 never equaled by the same number of employes in any office of the Government. During the day there were issued 861 or iginal certificates, 365 increase, 65 reissue, 20 restoration, 6 duplicate, 14 accrued, 5 act of March 3, 1333; 5 order of April 3, 1831 ; 5 order of Oct. 7, 1835; 5 act of Aug. 4, 1836; total, 1,345. The Board of Review disposed of 1,578 cases on the same day, and during the month thero were 3,555 original certificates issued, 2,057 increase, 584 reissue, 117 restoration, 39 duplicate, 186 accrued, 14 act of March 3, 1833 ; 33 order of April 3, 183-1 ; 21 order of Oct, 7, 1835; 32 act of Aug. 4, 1886; which, with 757 supplemental act of Aug. 4, 1336, and 15 reissue, make a grand total of 7,385. The figures hardly give a proper idea of the greatness of the value of work done. It is simply grand, and is a demonstra tion of the great increase in efficiency in the Pension Bureau siuce Gen. Black's entry into it that must silence all cavil. He has accomplished more, and with a less number of employes than any former Com missioner of Pensions, and probably than auy other Bureau officer of tho Government. THE 1'ATX OF ATLANTA.

PERSONAL. The suit to recover 5 15.CC0 from Gen. B.F.Butler, on the part of tho National Soldiers' Home, came up in the United States Circuit Court at Boston last week. Action Avas brought to recover what was alleged to be duo in Gen. Butler's accounts while nctincras treasurer of the institution. Gen. Tilton testified thnt Gen. Butler loaned him 815,000 to start a shoe store in connection with the Home, nnd thnt he gave Gen. Butler credit for the amount on the books of tho Home. The 515,000 was repaid to Gen. Butler in 137 i, but this payment had not been ac counted for in any way, although the amount hnd been charged as a credit in his accounts with tho Home. Gen. Butler's defense was thnt ho has paid the sum in full. A verdict was rendered against Gen. Butler for S16.537.50. A.H. Elwood, Mail Agent on the Grand Rapids Sc Indiana Road, was arrested at Grand Rapids last week by Inspectors Bns5ctt and Kidder. Elwood is charged with systematically robbing; letters, and 75 marked bills were found in bis possession. He confesses everything-, and acknowledges that the peculations amount to 52,000. Elwood's home is at Silver Creek, Ind., whero ho has a wifo and thrco children. He was appointed four years ago, is 50 years old, a veteran soldier and in poor health. Ho says he was led to steal by financial straits and for fear of leaving his family unprovided for. Gen. Ricketts has been for a fortnight lying dan gerously ill at his homo in Washington. For a time his recovery was despaired of, but his condition is slightly improved and his friends arc more hopeful. Capt. Robert Smalls, the colored Congressman who was defeated at the recent election by Col. Wm. Elliott, Democrat, will contest Elliott's elec tion nnd enys he Is confident thnt the House will seat him, although it has a Democratic majority. He says that tho Democratic party would not dare to enter the campaign of 1S33 after allowing Elliott to hold a scat fraudulently obtained from the fa mous Black District of South Carolina with its 25.0CO Republican majority. Ha thinks it would strengthen the Democratic pnrty at the North to put out a white man for a colored contestant, and that the party lenders will retire Elliott for effect. Touching the estrangement between Grant nnd Hancock, nn ofllcor of the former's staflf says that it "arosofrom a report which Gen. Grant sent to tho War Department about the battle of Spottayl vaniiu Thnt was a hard and bloody fight, nnd the Second Corps, under Gen. Hancock, performed most brilliant service. "When Gen. Grant made up his report he did not mention Gen. Hnncock by name. The report did not particularize any officer, but it dealt fairly and honestly with the magnificent work of the Second Corps. Gen. Hancock thought thnt he ought to have been mentioned by mime, and wrote a letter to Gen. Grant In a complaining spirit. I do not know whether Gen. Grant replied to it or not, but I do know thnt Gen. Hancock thought thnt tho Lieutenant-General hnd failed to do him justice." Mr. George Ticknor Curtis delivered a Iecturo In tho Academy of Music, Philadelphia, Saturday evening, under the auspices of the McClcllnn Me morial Association, on the life, chnrncter and public services of Gen. Geo. B. McClellnn. He was cordially received by a large audience. Ho re viewed the late General's services in the field and his achievements in private life, nnd said that In future history McClcllnn would be spoken of nsone of the foremost Americans of his time. "McClcl lnn," the speaker sntd, "hnd been impeded In his militnry career by a cabal at Washington, to whom his success would have been a disappointment nnd an interference with plans nnd desires of their own. Stanton, according to McClellnn's own story, threw every obstacle in McClellnn's way and en deavored to create distrust between him and tho President." The receipts of the lecture go to the fund for the erection of a memorial to McClcllnn in Fnirmount Park. Mnj.-Gen. Robert B. Potter, who went out as Colonel of the 5tst N. Y.,.
