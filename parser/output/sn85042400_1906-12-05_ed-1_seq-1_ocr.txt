PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT DELIV ERS ANNUAL MESSAGE Opposes Contributions by Funds to Be Used FAVORS ABOLISHMENT Calls Attention of Congress to Southern Lynching for Alleged Crime of Rape Sometimes an Excuse for Lynch Law for Petty -Misdemeanors Inciting Mobs to Crimes. QUESTION OF CAPITAL AND LABOR DISCUSSED AND CONSIDERED PRE8IDENT FAVORS LAW 

MAKING EIGHT HOURS A DAY'S LABOR ON ALL PUBLIC WORKS AND CALLS ATTENTION TO THE NECESSITY OF A LAW FOR THE PROTECTION OF CHILDREN EMPLOYED IN FACTORIE8j ALSO FAVORS EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY LAW. WASHINGTON, Deo. 4. President Roosevelt's message occupied the at tention of the Senate for two houra 'and a half today to the exclusion of nearly all other bualneas. The mesaage to m follow:' To the. Senate and House. of Repro tentative: . Aa a nation we atlll continue to en Joy a literally unprecedented proaper Ity; and It is probable that only reck less speculation and disregard of legi timate business methods on the part of the buslneaa world can materially mar this proaperlty. No Congress In cur time haa done more good work of Importance than the present Congress. There were se veral matters left unfinlahed at your last session, however, which I most earnestly hope you will complete be fore your adjournment I again recommend a law prohibit ing all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any par ty. Such a bill haa already peat one Houae of Congresa. Let Individuals contribute as they dealre; but let us prohibit In effective fashion all cor porations , from making contribution for any political purpose, directly or Indirectly. Another bill which haa already past one Houae of Congress and which It is urgently necessary should be enacted into law la that conferring upon the Government the right of appeal in crlm lnal cases on questions of law. This right exists In many of the States; It exists In the District of Columbia by act Of the Congress. It la of courae not proposed that In any case a ver dict for the defendant on, the merits should be set aside. Recently In one district where the Government had In dicted certain persons for conspiracy to obtain rebates, the court sustained the defendant's demurrer; while In another Jurisdiction an Indictment for conspiracy to obtain rebates has been sustained by the court, convictions ob tained under It, and two defendants sentenced to Imprisonment. ' . I have specifically In view a recent decision by a district Judge leaving railway employees without remedy for violation of a certain so-called labor statue. It seems an absurdity to per mit a single district Judge, againBt what may be the judgment of the Im mense majority of his colleagues on the bench, to declare n law solemnly enacted by the Congress to be "un constitutional," and then to deny to the Government the right to have the Su preme Court definitely decide the ques tion. 1 It Is well to recollect that the real efficiency of the law often depends not upon the passage of acts aa to which there la a great public excitement, but upon the passage of acts of this nature aa to which there la not much public Corporations to Campaign in National Elections. OF 

LABOR INJUNCTIONS excitement, because there la little pub lic understanding of their Importance, while the Interested parties are keenly ' alive to the desirability of defeating them. The Importance of enacting ln- ( to law the particular bill In question j la further Increased by the fact that j the Government haa now definitely be gun a policy of resorting to the crlml s nal law In thoae trust and Interstate i commerce cases where such a course i offers a reasonable chance of success. In my last message I suggested the enactment of a law in connection with the Issuance of Injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the mat ter by the demand that the right of applying Injunctions In labor cases should be wholly abolished. It Is at least doubtful whether a law abolish ing altogether the use of Injunctions In such cases would stand the test ot the courts; In which case of course the legislation would be Ineffective. More' over, I believe it would be wrong al together to prohibit the use of Injunc tlons. It la criminal to permit sym pathy for criminals to weaken our hands In upholding the law; and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob violence there should be no lm palrment of the power of the courts to deal with them In the most summary and effective way possible. But so far as possible. the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such law as I advocated last year. In this matter of Injunctions there Is lodged In 'the hands of the Judicary a necessary power which Is neverthe less subject to the possibility of grave abuse. It is a power that should be exercised with extreme care and should be subject to the Jealous scrutiny of all men, and condemnation should be moted out as much to the judge who fails to use It boldly when necessary as to the Judge who uses It wantonly or oppressively. Of course a Judge strong enough to be fit for his office will enjoin any resort to violence or in timidation, especially by conspiracy, no matter what his opinion may be of the rights of the original quarrel. There must be no hesitation in dealing with disorder. But there must like wise be no such abuse of the injunc tive power as Is implied In forbidding laboring men to strive for their own betterment In peaceful and lawful ways; nor must the Injunction be used merely to aid some big corporation In In carrying out schemes for Us Own aggrandizement. It must be remem bered that a preliminary Injunction In a labor case, If granted without ade quate proof (even, when authority can be found to support the conclusions of law on which It Is founded), may of ten settle the dispute between the par ties; and therefore If Improperly gran ted may do Irreparable wrong. Yet there are many judges who assume a matter-of-course granting of a preli minary injunction to be the ordinary and proper judicial disposition of such cases; and there have undoubtedly been flagrant wrong committed by Judges In connection with labor dis putes even within the last few year, altho I think much leas often than in former year. Such Judge' by their unwise action Immensely 'strengthen the hands of thoae who are striving entirely to. do away with the power of Injunction; and therefore such, care less use of the Injunctive) process tends to threaten its very existence, for If the American people ever become con vinced that this process la habitually abused, whether in, matters affecting labor or In matter affecting corpora tions, It will be well-nigh Impossible to prevent its abolition. " T In connection with the delays of the law, I call your attention and the at tention of the Nation to the prevalence of crime among us and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up, now In one part of our country, now In another. Each sec tion, North, South, East, or West has its own faults; no section can with wisdom spend Its time jeering at the faults of another section; tt should be busy trying to mend its own short comings, To deal with the prime of corruption it Is necessary to have an awakened public conscience, and to supplement this by whatever legisla tlon will add speed and certainty in the execution of the law. When we deal with lynching even more Is necessary. A great many white men are lynched. but the crime is peculiarly frequent In respect to black men. The greatest existing cause of lynching la the per petratlon, especially by black men, of the hideous crime of rape the most abominable In ail the category tof crimes, even worse than murder. Mobs frequently avenge the commission of this crime by themselves torturing to death the man committing it; thus (Continued on Page 8.) COMMITTEE WILL ACT Interstate Commerce Commission to Investigate Car Shortage. HAS COMMISSION AUTHORITY Can Exercise No Direct Power to Com pel Interstate Carriers to Furnish Adequate ' Equipment foif ' Shippers. WASHINGTON, Deo. 4. The In tentions and attitude of the Interstate Commerce Commission respecting the car shortage In the Northwest are made clear in a letter, addressed to Senator Hansbrough by Chairman knapp, which said: "The inability of shippers to secure cars ror the move ment of their traffic Is reported from various parts of the country and amounts In some sections to almost a calamity. The matter . has given the commission special concern, al though we appear to be without ade' quate authority to deal with the sit uation. We can exercise no ' direct power to compel the Interstate car riers to furnish " adequate equipment, nor are we prepared at the present time to recommend specific legisla tion on tho subject" . Chairman Knapp said the commis sion could probably award damages resulting from the failure to supply sufficient cars, but the power to do this Is not altogether certain, and he says: "It would be rather more suitable and efficient for the aggrieved Bbippera to bring their suits In the courts of first Instance. We have, however, ordered an Investigation of the matter of the car shortage and will prosecute it with the utmost dis patch. Already one or more agents have been sent to the Northwest and it is expected that hearings will take place in that region within the next two weeks." 

GUILTY OF MURDER C. Gillette Found Guilty of Murder By Jury. SENTENCED THURSDAY Murdered His Sweetheart Grace Brown at Big Moose Lake July II. ONLY TWO BALLOTS TAKEN Immediately After the Jury Had Bean Polled He Wrote a Telegram to His Father Announcing the Verdict HERKIMER, Dec. 4. The Jury In the trial of Chester Gillette, accused of murdering his sweetheart Grace Brown, at Big Moose Lake, on July 11th of this year, tonight returned a verdict of guilty of murder In the, first degree. Sentence will be pro nounced on young Gillette next Thurs day morning, to which time the court adjourned after the Jury had report ed. , -. ' young Gillette sat motionless In his chair as the jury was polled and when the twelfth man had responded, the stolid Indifference of the boy waa ex hibited as never before. : Leaning over a nearby table, he drew toward him a bit of white paper and taking a pen cil from his pocket wrote this mes sage: . ' , "Father, I am convicted. Chester." This is one of the earliest dispatches carrying the news of Gillette's doom beyond the walls of the court house. It went to his father In Denver. After the jury had been polled, the case went over until Thursday when Gillette will be sentenced. The Jury stood eleven for conviction and one for acquittal until the sixth ballot The attorneys for Gillette will make a motion for a new trial, preliminary to taking an appeal to the supreme) court, for alleged erros of law oc curring during the trial. This will not interfere with the sentence which will be Imposed by the court CONGRESS IN SESSION. Most of the Day Devoted to the Pres ident's Message. WASHINGTON, Dec. 4.
