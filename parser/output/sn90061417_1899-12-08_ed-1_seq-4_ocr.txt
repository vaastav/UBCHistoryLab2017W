I a h pt liieui was very orii. nin nn ed by a strict party lote. The objection to Mr. K ib-rts being sworn in, were that he had been con victed of polygamy, and had served a term in prison for the otTence. The tec ord of his conviction will be produced before the committee. The que-tien then will be whether or not Koberts ac cepted the amuesty of Presidents Har rison and Cleveland in good faith and has lived up to his professions. IPs cju viction under the Kluiunds law made him ineligible to hold any oilier under the United States. His restoration t-i eligibility is dependent entirely upon whether or nut he has complied with the conditions of the amnesty. The fact of his conviction, and the fact that it is now a mailer of 'public notoriety that he hub not faithfully lived up to the conditions of the am nesty, will, it is held, place the burden of proof upon him. Congressman Kichardson, of Tennes see, who will lead the Democrats in tl e house, presided over the convention that nomiuated Bryan at most of its sessions. He is a careful parliamentarian, smooth in ninuner and quite a contrast to the impulsive B.uley. In the lawer house the several parties will stand. Republicans l-o Democrnts W Populists Silveriles !l The session which be-an its work Monday, will lime a great deal of in terest for the country. The pimcipal work, of course, winch will be done will be in relation to our new territory. The framework of a civil government v ill be adopted for the Philippines, anil some thing more than that for Porto Uico Hnd Hawaii. The case of Cuba, too. will be attended to. Then there is the financial question to be considered. All the members of the joint committee of Republican senators and representa tive who held sessions during the um mer favor the ennctment of a law which will fix the gold standard lirmly in the statutes. The president favrs this legislation, too, and undoubtedly will recommend it in his forthcoming mess age to congress. The nation's law makers will hnve enough important work to keep thi-m busy during every hour of the present term. After nn interesting debate of three hour, the house on Tuesday, by a vote of 302 to adopted the resolution for a committe to investigate the charge? iiganist Mr.Hoberts, the Morman repre sentative-elect from I'tah. Previous to this ttie house had rejected a sub reso lution otTered by Mr. Richardson, of Tennessee, the leader of the Democratic tuinority, to allow Mr. Huberts to be j sworn in. and to semi the case to the J judiciary committee. Fifty seven Demo crats voted for the sub-resolution. Of the thirty who voted against the Tailor resolution all were Democrats except Mr. Loud, of California, a Republic and .Mr. Xewlands, of Xevada, a sdverile. ISy the terms of the resolution Mr. Roberts is not only excluded from all participation in the proceedings ot the house until the committee reports and the house passes upon his case, (bill lie is denied a seat in the hull. Whfther this will be interpreted to deny him ad mission within the chamber pending the disposition of disease, is yet to be decided. Following Mr Richaidsou, the minority leader, Mr. Roberts took the floor in his own defense, occupying an hour. Mr. Taylor spoke in tavorof his reso lution aud against the oath being ad miuisted to Mr. Reberts, and said: "Mr. Speaker, ITah was admitted as a stale int-) the I'nion on the 1th .lay of jHnuiiri, lSlO.

The Message. 1'resident McKinlei's third annual message was read t the LVIth con gross on Tuesday. It isthelongest mes sage ever sent to congress by him, and consists of :2'),tX) winis. The most important features of the message relate to the new dependencies and to the tinancia! question. Upon the Philippine question he sajs: The future government of ttie Philip pities rests with the congrebs of the I'mted Slates. I-Vw graver responsi bilitles have ever been contided to us. If ue accept them in a spirit worthy of our race and of our traditions, a erent o:i- port unity, comes with them. The islands lie under theshelter ot our llag I'liey are ours bv everv title of law and equity. They cannot be abandoned. If we desert them we leave them at once to anarchy and linalh to barbarism. We thug them, a golden apple of discord, among the rival powers, no one of which could permit another to seize them tin questioned. Their rich plains and v:l lages would be the scenes of elidles strife and blood-hwd. The advent of Dewey's Meet in Manila bay. instead of being, as We hope, the dawn of a new day of freedom and progress, will hsue been the beginning of nil era of misery and violence worse than nny which has d irkened their unhappy past." Civil government in Cuba under mili tary control is recommended until some sob-tantinl tiriuFtesS has been made through the medium of sulfrage toward ! the establishment of in independent i lorni oi eovernmpni. lorm oi governmeni. The president urges cisinn possible as to the form of govern ment necessary for IWlo Rico to take the place of the present military form, ami the earliest possible measures to create a market in this country for Porto Rican products which have lost their Spauish trade. This is in accor dance with the 'otlictal reports upon Porto Rican conditions. Hawaii demands early attention, in the evecutive's opinion, nnnevitmn hav ing left the islands in more or less con fusion pending Ihe adoption nf per manent regulations.
