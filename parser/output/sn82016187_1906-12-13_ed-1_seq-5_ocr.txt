I jMJform Senator Lodge has introduced a bill Drepared by Mr Wlllington which pro vides for the creation of a board to take charge of old records and for the establishment of a Hall of Records in this city The bill does not call for an Dprunriation The proposed board is to be com posed of tho Vice President the Speak er or the House the Secretary of State tlie Secretary of the Treasury one Judge each from the Supreme Court a Cir cuit Court and a District Court and such members of a Joint Committee on Records as may be named by the two Houses of Congress The bill proposes that this board shall havo solo legal custody of all books of records and filed papers in whfch the latest date of rec ord is upward of 80 years Documents of lesser ace may also be placed In the custody of the board on the order of the President or other designated offi cials of tho Government and the board may receive important records from State authorities It is a somewhat remarkable fact that the Senate should not have con firmed the nominations of tho President for his new Cabinet for over a week It Is usual to confirm appointments ot this character at once and while it is not supposable that the Senate would not confirm It yet makes talk that the Senate did not confirm these appoint ments at once Theres ways and ways of spellin nowadays The President 13 a convert to nu spelling- as everybody knows The Supreme Court of the United States positively refuses to spell the new way or to haeaqy of its documents put into type in reform spelling- Congress has decided that its documents shall be spelled old style but has had to accept the Presidents Messages as he sends them in the nit spelling and so they will appear in the Congressional Rec ord right In the midst of all the prop erly spelled words And so It happens that things are doing at the Govern ment Printing Office An employe there says The copy cutters In tho Government Printing Office are having their experi ence with the Presidents spelling In corisequeTice of the decision by the Printing Committee- of Congress to ad jure to the ancient manner of using the alphabet there are really two lan guages running side by side in the big print shop As every bill or document may ba veral pages long and must necessarily be cut up into many takes given out to scores of compositors It would not take longfdr the confusion of- Babel to result from the use of two kinds of orthography under the same -roof Ail documents coming from the Whit J3oui e or from the Executive Depart ments must be set up in the Presidents spelling Those from the Capitol must Je Hone in the spelling of the fathers To keen the hundreds of camnosl tors straight rubber -stamps have been furnished all the copy cutters so they can mark each cake In an executive

NATIONAL TRIBUNE WASHINGTON D THURSDAY DECEMBER IS 190 what use to get em Here Is a story apropos of the flower giving to M C3 It happened well several sessions agone A very popular member from Neir York got a tremendous great basket of American Beauty roses which repre sented basket sash ribbon and roses an outlay of something like 100 It came from tho Tammany braves and It was a stunner all right with roses that were at that particular time sell ing at 12 a dozen The basket was placed on his desk and hid three mens desks it was eo big and he got piles of other flowers The New fork M Cn wife sat In the gallery and saw all the flowers and she being frugally in clined made up her mind that she wouldn t buy any flowers for her re ception which was to take place that night but would just display An drews flowers A little later sho came down to see the flowers which had been removed to the corridor at the back of the House There were carloads of the fragrant beauties In that corridor and it was difficult to get around but that basket of beauties loomed above all else and hc went over to admire it at closer range Sho spied down close to the roots a card with an address on it and pulling at tho string which tied it to a rose stem brought to light an ad dress but It wasnt hers No in deedy It was addressed to a Miss and to a street and number much grander In every respect than that where the M C and his wife resided but the young lady was on her visiting list Mrs M C didnt hesitate a sec ond She quietly pulled that card oft the string and taking her own from her card case tied it in the place of tlu one removed Then she picked out the modest bunch of carnations which sho herself had sent her husband took off her card to him and placed In the cen ter of the bunch the one addressed to the Miss Then she looked over the other floral offerings but found that they were all to be sent to her As she stood near admiring some of the other funeral pieces the messengers of tho House intrusted with the distribution of the flowers came bustling in Say Jim Wheres that thundering great big basket of roses that Repre sentative particularly ordered sent to Miss V asked one of an other I can t find the bloomln thing re plied the other Heres one but It Is addressed to Representative a wife Reckon he changed his mind and did the decent thing Mustve since there aint no other here Say Jim by gosh his old woman caught on cause heies her carnations marked to send to Miss and heres the roses with her own card on em Say Im mighty glad I wont have to be there when he sees them roses setten on his wifes table And the wife who smiled and the newspaper woman who overheard the conversation and who had previously seen the exchange of cards moved in opposite directions The United States Supreme Court haJ reversed the Judgment of the Federal Court irt Florida in awarding to the heirs of John Forbes some 1200000 acres of land In that State claimed under the grant made by the Captain General of Cuba In 1818 before the cession of Florida to the United States The lower court found in favor of the claimants for the 79681 acres of land within the grant still belonging to the Government and ordered scrip to issueforlrso495 acres to be selected from any public land in the United States the whole award being worth about 25000000 i t This Judgment was- reversed tby thcv Supreme Coiirtt which held that the grant was void and that it could not be revived bythe act passed in 1860 authorizing the determination of such claims In deciding the case of Paul Hcyman vs the Southern Railway Company the United States Supreme Court held a railroad company becomes an insur ance company to its freight patrons Heyman la a wholesale liquor dealer in Augusta Ga Some years ago he sold and shipped two consignments of whisky to purchasers in Charleston S C where It was immediately seized by tne state authorities and destroyed in pursuance oi me soutn Carolina dis pensary law while still in the ware house in which it had been placed by tne railroad company Heyman was compelled to return the purchase price to the consignees and then sought to recover from the rail road company on the ground that thu company had insured the safe deliv ery of the goods The Georgia Supreme Court held that as the property had been seized under legal authority the company could not be held liable The opinion or tne federal supreme Court was de livered by Justice White and reversed the finding of the lower court When folk stare as Mrs Henry Cabot ioage anves along Washington streets
