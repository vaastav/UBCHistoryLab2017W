TALK ON TREATY Opposition Developed by a Southern Senator FINDS WEAK SPOTS An Insistence Upon the Spirit of the Amendments to the Old Hay Fanncefote Treaty On the Other Hand Sera'or Cullom Contends That the New Convention Offers the United States Every Desira ble Advantage- Washington, Iec. 11. Two speeches on the Hay-Pauncefote treaty were made in the executive session of the senate today, one by Senator Bacon in opposition to the treaty and the other by Senator Cullom. prospective chair man of the committee on foreign rela tions, in support of it Mr. Bacon referred to the speech made yesterday by Senator Lodge. He summed up his objection In a statement that he could not freely accept any treaty which does not place the isth mian canal entirely under American auspices and American control. This, he said, the pending treaty does not do, nor does It do anything like it. It did not by long odds accomplish what had been accomplished by congress. The ravis amendment, he said, had abro gated all the objectionable provisions of that treaty as negotiated and It did not matter what provisions there were in the agreement so long as the United States was authorized, as it was by the principal Davis amendment, to secure the safety and maintenance -of the canal by Its own forces. That amend ment had given this country a free hand to do what was necessary for the pro tection and defense of the canal, where as the present treaty carried all the re strictions which were originally con tained in the old treaty, leaving out th modifications of the Davis amendment. He also pointed out that the treaty re produced the restrictions of the old Suez cana treaty, which had been in corporated In the original convention. Senator Cullom congratulated the senate and the country upon the fact that there are two things in, connection with the new treaty upon which prac tically all are decided. One of theso was the desirability of the suppression of the Clayton-Bulwer treaty and thi other the necessity for the construction of an isthmian canal. He contended that the new treaty radically changes the conditions presented by the first Hay-Pauncefote' treaty, clearly reliev ing the necessity of such amendment as that made to the old treaty upon the suggestion of Senator Davis, because the treaty itself would permit the Unit ed States, under international law, to 

KATIE WON AGAJN. A Utah Woman's Management. , "The first misunderstanding- that Katie and I ever had was on account of coffee. She would not give it to me because she was sure it was the cause of my nervousness and sick spells, so I regularly dropped lntd my aunt's house on the way from school 1 am a school teacher you see) and stealthily put down a good strong cup of coffee each day. "One of my sleepless nights I lay wondering what ailed me and how long my money would last if I got sick suddenly. I went to school the next day as I had often done before, with nerves very tremulous and a distres sing headache creeping over every cubic inch of my brain. "When I reached the dinner table at night, shaved and in my right mind, but very tired and faint, I gave a little start of surprise and delight, followed instantly with a feeling of shame. Had my sharp, though mild-eyed lit tle wife discovered the extent of my lecent perfidy? Did she know I had been taking coffee each day, con trary to agreement? Beside my plate In my own beautiful silver Xmas pres ent cup, smoked and fairly smiled the beverage, inviting, delicious liquid. I hastened to pour in a generous supply of cream with the usual ratio of sugar. Then I Eipped the treasure with delight. "It tasted u good deal better than usual some way, but not exactly nat ural. When my cup was about half empty I began to wonder if It would be replenished, so I stole a glance at the little woman. She had a far away look in her eyes and a little victorious curl on her lips. "All at once I understood, 'Nov; Katie, I said amazedly, you don't mean to tell me this i& Postum?' Her pretty little laugh rang out at once, and she anked through the folds of her napkin, 'Don't you think now there Is such a thing as a good food coffee? "I roared (with my late experience fresh in my mind) 'Don't ever say coffee to me again: I am a saved man tonight." I then and there hugged my guardian angel and swore off on cof fee, 'for keeps. "My health and spirits have been gaining steadily, until now I sleep like a babe and eat like a , well, like a man who knows his food is going to agree with him. "It was a happy day for wife and I (and for numbers of our rrlends) when the real danger of coffee drinking was dhuovered and a beverage that would take its place was put on our table. I have been saved from a spell of nervous prostration, the outcome of which no one can ever fortell." Ross House, Robinson, Utah. own, manage and defend the canal In any away it may choose. In other words, in a war with Great Britain or any other power the treaty would be suspended under the law which governs nations until the war should be con cluded, when it would be revived again and be In force. He dwelt upon the fact, which was the most Important clrcumstanc to be considered, that the new treaty proposes to abrogate ths Clayton-Bulwer convention of 1850, and for this reason would be of untold value to the country- v THE OPEN SESSION. When the senate met today prayer was offered by Rev. Herrick Johnson of Chicago, Chaplain Milburn being ab sent. The house concurrent resolution pro viding for a holiday adjournment from December 19 until January 9 was re ferred to the committee on appropria tions..

THREE DEAD Two Texas Policemen and a Banco Steerer. Houston. Texas. Dec. 11. When po licemen J. C James and Herman Tounst attempted to arrest an allege ! bunco steerer, Sid Preacher, this after noon the latter opened fire with a shot gun. At the first Are he mortally wounded James. He then fired at Tounst. knocking him down, and was on top of him beating him, when Jame raised himself from the gutter and fired three times, killing Preacher. Both James and Younst were dead before as sistance came. There is great excitement over the matter, as this is carnival week and the town Is crowded with people. Several hundred people saw the fatal duel between Preacher and the two po licemen. A warrant was sworn out to night by the deputy chief of police for Brock man. Preacher's attorney, charg ing him with murder. He was put In jail. It Is said that Brook man ad vise t Preacher to use a shotgun if an attempt was made to arrest him. THE SIX DAY RACE. A Brave But Ineffectual Trial To Steal a Lap. New York. Dec. 11. Eight thousand people at Madison Square Garden , to night saw Walthour, fresh from a two hours' rest, try to steal a lap on the other riders in the six days bicycle race. He was unsuccessful. but he worked the crowd up to a pitch of great enthusiasm. For a time It ap peared that the Atlanta rider would gain the long-sought lap. For three mites he kept up a terrific pace, one which, it is said by veterans in six day racing, was remarkable. The racers were spread all around Vhe track. Fredericks and Julius were passed In the order named by the fly ing southerner, who was then relieved by McEachern. the latter following up the advantage gained by his mate. After an exciting chase of a mile McKachern let -down, but Fisher re lieved Chevelier and kept the pace hot. Changes came e'ery few minutes. When the men finally came down to a slow pace the tail enders had lost the lap. Had McEachern kept up the gait set by his partner the team would have been a lap to the good. At 10 o'clock there were 10,000 people .in the garden, and the ring inside the track was jammed. At this time the sev entieth hour the leaders In the six day contest are 22 miles behind the record. MULTI-TRAIN ROBBER. TCIrkpatrlck Connected With a Crlma at Winnemucca. St. Louis, Dec. 11. Another crime has been laid at the door of Ben Kilpatrlcle. the alleged train robber who was ar rested In this city November 5. after i passing a number of bills of the Helena National bank, which wer taken from the Great Northern train when it wns robbed. Today George 3. Nixon, president of the Rmk of Winnemucca. Tex., posi tively identified Kilpatrlck as one of three 'mens who on September 19. a year ago, entered the bank and at the muzzles of revolvers forced Nixon to hand over J32.540 cash. 

SCIENTIFIC BUREAUS Reason For the President's Recommendation That They bo Fat Tinder the Agricul ture Department The flan Only a More Equitable Division of Work. Washington, Dec. 11 (Special.) "The scientific bureaus generally should be put under the department of agricul ture," said President Roosevelt in his message. In the original scheme for the department of commerce and Indus try, as expressed in a bill which was in troduced in the Fifty-sixth congress, it was the intention to include the scien tific bureaus of the government In the new department. It is now understood, however, that the president is opposed to including the scientific bureaus In a department of commerce, as he desire that the new member of the cabinet, if congress decides to provide one. should not have so much upon 4ils hands but that he can give practically his whole attention to matters of forelga trade. While recommending a department of commerce represented by a cabinet offi cer, the president also recommends fur ther that the scientific bureaus should be grouped under the secretary of agri culture. These bureaus, representing an annual expenditure of about $8,000. 000. are new in several departments. The scientific work of the government is now very widely diffused, the ar rangement being largely the result of accident. Each new bureau created has been attached to the department which happened at the time to be the newest. For Instance, the coast and geodetic survey, the oldest of the scientific bu reaus, was attached to the treasury de partment, as that was at the time the "catch all' for newly created bureaus. The geological surveywhen created was attached to the department of the interior, at the time the youngest of the departments. The scientific bureaus are now dis tributed as follows: In the treasury department are found the bureau of statistics, life saving service, coast and geodetic survey and marine hospital service. In the navy department are found the naval observatory, nautical almanac and museum of hygiene. In the department of the interior -are found the board of education, the geo logical survey and the census office. Not connected with any department are the bureau of labor, commission of fish and fisheries, board of geographical names and bureau of standards. The coast and geodetic surveys, now under the treasury department, carries on surveys along the coast and makes careful determination of points In the interior of the country. The geological survey, under another department, that of the interior, takes up the work of the geological survey and finishes the typographic mapping. If the personal relations between the heads of these bureaus happens to be cordial, as they are at present, beneficial co-operation rsults: If the relations are otherwise. more or less duplication and friction re sults. The forestry work of the government, as fully shown by the president In his message, is widely scattred. and should be consolidated to obtain better results. The Irrigation investigation begun In 1888 by the geological survey and car ried by them from a standpoint of na tional Interest In the matter are being duplicated In part by the department of agriculture from a local or state con trol point of view. No good, reason can be advanced for not having all the Irri gation work done by one department, and If the geological survey is trans ferred to the Jurisdiction of the secre tary of agriculture harmonious action would be Insured. The statistical work of the govern ment Is being duplicated In part by the statistic bureaus of the treasury de partment and the department of agri culture and by the census office In the department of the lnterlr.-. The work of the census Is at present temporary and not co-ordinate with existing bu reaus. New men are now being trained n the census office to repeat the work being done by men In government em ploy elsewhere. With a iermanent cen sus bureau as is now proposed, placed in the same department with other sci entific bureaus or bureaus of Informa tion, such duplication of work could be prevented. . Including the pension list, which m In the department of the interior, the secretary of that department super vises the expenditure annually of ap proximately $4,000,000, whereas the sec retary of agriculture, a co-ordinate offi cer in the cabinet, supervises the ex penditure of only about $4,000,000. The enormous amount of business which comes to the desk of the secretary of the interior from the many ramifica tions of his department are only realized by those who have endeavored to secure prompt a-ction in matters re quiring his decision. The bureau of forestry alone has fur nished the secretary of the InteVlor with more questions. Investigations and adjudications than one man should be called upon to take care of, and nec essarily precluded giving proper atten tion to other and even more Important features. The business of the government has become so enormous and so unwieldy that it requires the utmost system to Insure dispatch and guard against duplication. As the government is now constituted. Its machinery is a matter of growth and evolution, new features being taken on hero, and there from year to year wherever It seemed possi ble to effect lodgement for them. The segregation of the scientific bu reaus or bureaus of information from the different departments Is equally as important as the creation of a. new de partment as proposed. The president, while fully aware of the Importance of this move, was unable to make more than passing reference to the same in I his recent: message.,

WOULDN'T FISH WITH OLD MAN. Father of Dtryea's Fiancee Forbade Him the House Married Now. New York, Dec. 11. Marguerite Moore, the 21-year-old daughter of Pe ter C. Moore of Benson avenue and Bay Twenty-second street. Bath Beach, left her home a week ago and had not been heard from by her fam ily until yesterday morning. It was then announced that Miss Moore had been married .six weeks ago to Clifford Duryea of Bay Ridge, and was now living at Honiewood, within ten min utes' walk of her father's house. Miss Moore's father is a clerk In the Fifth municipal court at Bath Beach. It is said that young Duryea was for bidden the house because he refused to go fishing with Miss Moore's fa ther. He went on one fishing excur sion with his wife's father, but as he got half frozen and caught ( no fish, he vowed he would never repeat the experience. He persistently refused afterward to go fishing with the old man. and this led to a quarrel between them. CUBA MUST WAIT Congress Can Not Negotiate With Military Rulers Stable Government Mutt be Estab lished in the Island Before Re ciprocity Treaties Can be Nego tiated. Washington, " Dec. 11. The Cuban commissioners who have been In Wash ington for a week are encouraged to hope that some action will be takeu by congress - for the relief of their Island. They realize tha t they cannot expect exi.-ciitive Interference. "The president told them that they must go to congress, as that body alone had tha power to grant tariff concessions. He has made a strong recommendation for Cuban reciprocity in his message, and he can do no more. They submitted their case to Senator Piatt of Connec ticut!, and he advised them to put their proposition in writing, which was done. Their petition ami the bill they proposed have been published. The senators who have been consult ed express themselves willing to help Cuba In every way possible, but they do not believe that congress will grant free trade to Cuban sugar and to bacco, nor do they see how there can be any legislation by congress until a Cuban government has leen organized and is ready to negotiate a reciprocity treaty. They do not see how the Cubans can be committed to a. treaty by the military government there, which Is under the control of the presi dent of the United States. While the Cubans' have brought the question to congress in a direct way, they have no succeeded In convincing the leaders of congress that their plan is either acceptable or practicable. The Cuban question will remain a trouble some one. with no probability of any legislation until a Cuban government has been organized. In the mtar.tlme there are a good many western republicans, among them Chairman Cannon of the appropriations committee, who are saying that Cubt will only be able to obtain what is nec essary to her prosperity by following the example of Hawaii and Porto Rico and requesting It to become an Ameri can territory under the full control of i the United States. Some western sen J ators who believe that Is the Inevitable destiny of Cuba, think that the Cuban question ought to be settled now for all time. They would not forcibly an nex Cuba, but let her try independence, if that Is her desire, but If she wants to share In the mnrkets and prosperity of the United States let her accept the time honored way and ask for annexa tion. It Is needless to s&y that this pro gramme does not appeal to conserva tive leaders like Piatt of Connecticut. Aldrich, Lodge, and. in fact, most of the most prominent eastern republic? ans. They favor reciprocity as the sur est way to postpone annexation. With out reciprocity they look for such ln- J dustrial depression In Cuba as will in a snort time result in political demoraliz ation, compelling the United States to resume control of the island as a meas ure of self-protection.

AMXKICAN CONGRESS Threatens to Break Up On the Arbi tration Question: - Washington. Dec. 11. The state de partment has been obliged to decline to be drawn Into a discussion of the various projects for general arbitra tion now pending before the congress of the American republics in Mexico. The Issue presented, in substance. Is compulsory arbitration versus volun tary arbitration, and Chili Is bitterly opposed to the former, which Is be lieved to have the support of a major ity of the delegates. As this subject threatens to dis rupt the congress, and the delegates seem unable to reach an agreement among themselves, several appeals have been made to the United States government to cast its influence In the matter to determine the issue. This, however, the state department declined to do. taking the ground that having fully and properly Instructed Its delegates to the congress, it an not Interfere with them In their actions upon the subject before the congress.

ANTIS CAUCUS Louisiana and Philip pines Tariff Bill HEEDED FOR SUGAR Democratic Bepresentativtr of That State Will Stand With the Ad ministration on the Measure jUr. Teller and All the Disaffected Participated in th Senatorial Cau cus to Consider Committee Assignments-- '-J Washington. Dec. 11. Numerous con ferences of the democratic members were held prior to th meeting of the ways and means committee today, be cause ot a question which had arisen as to a united opposition to the Philip pines tariff hill drafted by the republi can members. It developed that four Louisiana members now in the city. Representatives Robertson. Meyer. Davev and Ransdell, were favorable to the bill and that two Louisiana mem bers out of the city. Messrs Broussard and Breazzelle, would probably favor it. The Louisiana members made no concealment of the fact that the sugar industry of their state required a meas ure of protection against Philippines sugar which the majority bill gives by applying Dingley rates. Under these circumstances the minor ity members reached no united decision as to opposing the bill: although there will be a minority report opposing the measure on general grounds, the Louis iana members will hold themselves in dividually free to vote for the bill. Secretary Gage has written Chairman Payne pointing out that the bill should provide for a rebate when articles ex ported from this country contain, in gredients imported from the Philippines on which duty had been paid. The bill will probably be amended to conform to this suggestion. TELLER WAS PRESENT. Washington, Dec. 11. Democratic Senators today held the first caucus of the present session. Its purpose was to consider committee assignments, but the occasion was more than ordinarily pi niflcant because of the general at tendance u)on tne caucttsr-ATl the sen ators elected as democrats with the ex ception of Senator McLaurln of South Carolina, were present, as were also the senators elected bv the sliver re publicans or populists. All the inde pendents except Senator Teller of Colc rado, had entered the democratic cau. cus, held before the adjournment last March but Senator Teller then re mained awfcy. He was present, however, at today's conference and participated In the pro ceedings. Senator Jones was re-elected unanimously chairman of the caucus. The old committee on order of business was also re-appointed and one vacancy on that committee was filled by the se lection of Senator Dubois of Idaho, who was the choice of all the western mem bers of the caucus.
