It is said ,hat the Sherman silver law will be repealed before adjournment of Congress if the Democrats who arc pledged to its repeal do not fight for it. The managers of the world's fair are discussing the feasibility and propriety of keeping it open two seasons instead of one. Six months docs seem too short a time for the life of so vast and costly on enterprise. The wonderfully large and varied stocks of goods which the enterprising dealers in Indianapolis have in store for the holidays remove any possible pre text for its people to go abroad to pur chase. In this respect Indianapolis ceased to be a country village longsince. The Chicago Herald denounces "the system of governing by taxation, in Tented by the Republicans lu Con press." The Republican party never attempted to govern by taxation, but it certainly never promised to govern without taxa tion, which is the rainbow plan held out by the Democrats. During the fiscal year 1891 Califor nia, Nebraska and Utah produced 12, 634,838 pounds of beet sugar, but dur ing the fiscal year 1802 the output was 23,282,000 pounds, or twice as much. This increase shows that beet sugar can be as successfully produced hero as elsewhere, yet the bounty will doubt less be repealed and the now and im portant industry abandoned. , i - 1 No champion, defender or first friend has told the people of Indiana why sugar, coffee and tea cost twice as much per patient in the Central insane hos pital as they do in the Southern, but one who is very well informed about such matters says there would not bo such a difference tf an intelligent stew ard, whoso services would command $1,500 a year as n purchaser, should take the place of the three trustees as pur chasing agent. Hon. Elijah Mouse, of Massachu setts, warns the country that if the world's fair is open on Sundays the of fended Almighty is likely to retaliate by permitting cholera to scourge the coun try. Mr. Morse evidently cherishes tho ancient theory that the Almighty is a vindictive boing who goes out of His way to get even with imperfect mortals, but that theory is long out of date in tho religious West, which does Dot believe in revenge for revenge's lake. " We already have a whisky trust, and there are indications of an impending whisky ring and scandal. Tho whisky trust has bought up the entire output of the country, and virtually controls the situation. It is speculating for a rise in anticipation that the tax on whisky will be increased, and, having cornered tho market, is interested in bringing that .about. It can afford to pay $1,000,000, if necessary, to induce Congress to increase the tax, and when there is that much money dependent on a few votes there is pretty sure to be a scandal. The Cleveland Leader, after reading tho report of tho clerk of the Ohio State Board of Charities, showing that the aggregate salaries of the officers of tho infirmaries are larger than the sum spent for groceries for these institutions, re marks that it is time to inquire whether as good administration cannot bo ob tained by somo cheaper system. Here in Indiana, whero tho same conditions appear, it isn't worth the tiuio to inquire. Tho oQicials, by their silence, remark, in the words of a departed Democratic statesman, William M. Twced, "What fx going to do about itY1 Senator Yookiiees complains that his mail (meaning applications " for office) these days is so enormous that ho cannot keep up with it. Ho says ho has had experience beforo on tho approach of incoming administrations, but never anything like this. He hopes his f rienda in Indiana will be patient, and he deeply regrets that there aro not enough offices to go around. "It is a most painful duty, so far as I am concerned," says the Senator, "to bo compelled to decide between friends who are equally mer itorious and capable." Who said he had to decide, or what reason has he to think his decision will carry any wcightT Czar Cleveland has the last word. Hut Senator Yoorhecs's wail shows that tho Indiana office-seekers are coming to tho front in great shape. The appointment of Peter S. Gross- cud, of Chicago, as United States Dis trict judge, to succeed Judge Blodgetr, gives great satisfaction to the Chicago bar. r He Is an accomplished lawyer, and all who know him predict that he will make- an able Judge. Ho is only forty years old, and gives up a practice worth $20,000 a year to go on the bench, but his inclinations lie in that direction, and besides he is financially independent. Tho Chicago Tribune gives Judge Grosscnp a strong editorial indorsement andays "President Harrison hasdoubt less been as fortunate in his latest judi cial selection as in those which have preceded it." Tho Herald, whi :h is bit terly Democratic, says: "1'residcnt Harrison has sustained the f.irly excel lent record ho has mado in vho matter of his judicial appointments. Mr. Gross cup is highly regarded as a lawyer, and is credited with the qualities which fit him to adorn tho bench." 

TEYIEG TO BULLDOZE THE GOVEilSIIEHT. Tho action of the North Atlantic teamship Association shows an evident disposition to retaliate for thorestrictivo regulations on foreign immigration adopted by this go vernment. The steam ship association has announced that from and after Jan. 1, 103, it will carry no stcerago passengers, and that the rates for saloon and second cabin pas sengers will be raised and tho number of trips reduced. It is further an nounced that all special excursion rates for the Columbian world's exposition havo been withdrawn. Tho evident purpose of all this is to punish the United States for the restrictive regula tions, and it is probably hoped to raise a protest that will induce the government to rescind them. The Tefusal of the steamship company to carry steerage passengers need not disturb anybody, as that is precisely what is desired. Neither will the raising of rates for sa loon and second cabin passengers elicit any protest from the general public. This will affect only those who indulge in ocean travel, and, as a 'rule, they can afford to pay. Tho only occasion for serious regret in the action of tho com pany is the withdrawal of excursion rates to tho world's fair. "Thero is no doubt," says the cablegram announcing the action of tho company, "that this action will result in a largo falling off in the number 'of foreign visitors to the world's fair. Many of the parties that were being made up . to take advantage of the reduced rates that were expected to prevail during tho world's fair season will now be abandoned." This reveals the animus of the action. Everybody will regret to see tho foreign attend ance at the world's fair cutjlown, but even that ought not to'prevent the adoption of preventive measures against the introduction of cholera. The United States government cannot be bulldozed by a foreign steamship company, and, if it comes to that, American enterprise and energy will devise somo plan by which all who want to visit tho world's fair will bo ablo to get here. There is a very strong public sentiment in favorof an entire prohibition of foreign immi gration for at least one year. This pro hibition need not necessarily interfere with transient travel or visitors to tho exposition, and the government should not be deterred from doing its duty in the premises by tho threatening atti tude of foreign steamship companies. DEPRESSION IN CANADA. Tho most reliable advices from Cana da show that it is suffering an unparal leled business depression. In ten years the shrinkage in the value of farm lands has been CO per cent. In tho city of Toronto, which has long been one of the most nourishing in the Dominion, thero aro 7,000 vacant buildings. In tho smaller cities and villages tho situation is even worse. A writer in . the Akron (O.) Beacon, who has recently visited Canada, says the restricted commerce of tho Dominion with theUnited States is tho leading causo of Canadian depres sion. England cannot furnish an outlet for her special products such as the New England and like States would afford if they wero not partially shut out by tho high duties imposed. Its home markets are limited because there are no indus tries in the cities and larger towns paying tho wages of tho United States. 'Pho Canadian Pacific railway is one of tho chief causes of Canada's misfortunes. It has, through its sub sidies, imposed upon the peoplo tho larger part of its public debt, which is now 20 per head of tho population. The old French legal system, which the British government, at the time that it attained control of French Canada, agreed to maintain, bblongs to an an tiquated social system, and is an ob stacle to progress. For years a large proportion of tho young men . and women have left Canada for the United States, a process which has wasted the natural vitality of the country. Re cently tho unrest has become very gen eral. Dominion people see nothing but going from bad to worse under tho present rcqimc. While political influ ences and traditions connecting them with tho British throne are potent, it is evident that the masses are in earnest for a change. What this change shall bo is a difficult problem. An exchango suggests that a liberal form of reci procity is Canada's best hope now. To this suggestion it may bo said that un der the present conditions "a liberal form of reciprocity," such as would be reciprocity for both Canada and the United States, is impossible. Sach reciprocity is impossible, not because Canada would not agreo to it, but be cause she has no power to do so. A reciprocity that would be liberal would involve tho admission of the products of American factories at a lower rato of duty than those of the competing goods of Great Britain. Such a reciprocal treaty is impossible, not because Cana da would be averse to it, but because Great Britain, which makes Canada's treaties, would not agreo to a commer cial arrangement which would give a competitor tho advantage in the mar kets of a dependency. Canada must first separate herself from Great Brit ain beforo sho can treat Vith the United States. Mr. Gladstone represents a party whose policy has been less exact ing in regard to the outside possessions of Great Britain, and it has been stated that the policy he has in view would further separate Canada from the home government by the withdrawal of Brit ish troops and the discontinuing of other favors. In any case, the quiet revolution which seems to bo going on throughout Canada mast interest citi zens of the United States. THE NEW 

CHICAGO. The announcement of the 'generous gift of Mr. Philip Armour, the million aire packer, to the city of Chicago, com ing simultaneously with that of the probating of the late Jay Gould's will, 6hows thero are men and men. Mr. Gould did not leave a cent to any chari table or educational purpose; Mr. Ar mour, in addition to other generous gifts to charity, gives Chicago a mag nificent building especially erected for a manual training school, and adds $1,400,000 for its maintenance. From what is made known concerning the scope and plan of the school, it will probably be tho best of its kind in tho United States, which is equivalent to saying the best in tho world. It is such endowments and institutions as this which more than nny.thing else stamp Chicago as the most cosmopolitan and truly American city. The time has passed when . New York can afford to sneer at Chicago as provincial, or whon Boston can venture to smile at its liter ary pretensions. Chicago is no longer a mere commercial metropolis' and pork-packing center. It is rap idly becoming, indeed has already become, a literary and educational center ns well. The University of Chicago, recently opened nnderthe most brilliant auspices, promises tobecomo one of the greatest educational institutions of tho country, as it is already one of tho most richly endowed and ably officered. This is only one of tho many educational in stitutions of Chicago, and Mr. Armour's gift is only one of many evidences that the intellectual activities of the city are extending in every direction. We of Indianapolis can afford to ex tend ungrudgingrecognition of Chicago's growth in the direction of higher things, both because it is a typical Western city and because that growth tends to stimulate all other Western cities to efforts in the same direction. It is because Indianapolis has a field and a future of its own that it can afford to recognize to the full extent those of other cities. Colonel Lilly's prediction, Tuesday evening, that not a mule car would be on a leading street-railway line in the city at the date of tho National En campment called forth a hearty round of applause. Just now Indianapolis has enough electric cars to cause its peoplo to feel how very inadequate tho best mule car is and how intolerable the worst can bo. It is said that tho adop tion of electricity for motive power is attended by such excellent results that intelligent and enterprising managers lose no time in making tho change. If tho two lines which tho Citizens' com pany has built to Crown Hill and tho lines extended to Fairviow and tho Fair-grounds arc profitable investments, lines down Virginia avenue, to West In dianapolis and Haughville cannot fail to be remunerative. While others are important, these three lines, and partic ularly Virginia avenuo, are of iinpera,-. tivo necessity. To get them by, the date of the encampmentwonld be worth tho money the peoplo will expend for it. Now hero is a pathetic plea. A soldier's widow from Ohio writes to Secretary Noble that she would like to have her pen sion certiticate so adjusted that she could marry again without forfeiting her pen sion. She says she has lived a widowsince 1862 and never intended to marry, but now in her advanced years finds herself lonely and would like to have a husband. Being oid, and poor, and plain she con siders it unlikely that she could find any man able to suppoit her us well as bur pen sion could, and consequently must take, such as she could get. She considers, it -a great hardship tbat she aud widows like, her are de barred from matrimony i by tho. harsh regulation that cuts off their little infome when they cease to be widows. There Isno doubt that this Ohio woman has found "such as she can get." aud has a possible husband in her mind's eye as she writes, but one who has but little of this jnrorlcVs goods. Secretary Noble's hoart, which is tender, must have been harrowed as he con sidered his potvcrlossdess in the matter and pictured tho case of true love and would be matrimony turned to despair and perma nent loneliness all for a matter of money. Even the hearts of the stitTest Democrats, who threaten to cut otl many pensions, could hardly fail ' to be touched by such affecting conditions'. ."Love," however, as the poet remarks, "will tind a way!'' and tho Ohio widow declares that she will keep on writing till her request is complied with.

A private subscription has been opened for composer lialfe, who is a pauper and is obliged to enter a London refuge. His father left him a good estate. His sister Victorie died the-wife of a Spanish Grande, Duke De Frias. It is a mystery how the son became a pauper and was deserted by his friends.

Ex-Governor Campbell, of Ohio, possessed the manhood and the nerve to stand in the midst of all this hypocrisy and cant and to givo expression to some trne Democratic doctrine. It was undoubtedly a great re lief to Mr. Cleveland to listen to these words, but, of course, they did not elimi nate the insult heaped upon the President elect by the Iteform Club. Why They Kictt Abous Pensions. New York Advertiser. One explanation of the reason why tho Calhonnists are so eager to cut down the pensions may be fouud in the fact that there are $100,000,000 of claims acainst the government from Southern Democrats wbo did not bear arms during the war. The Democrats of the present House passed $70,000,000 of these claims at the last ses sion. If they have control of the next Conuress, with Cleveland in the White House, they will whoop the whole amount tbrouch without delav. These chums must not be confused with the f.TOO.OtO.OOO for slaves and other property of armed rebels. Oi course, thia $400,000,000 cannot be paid If the pension payments are kept up.

TIIK M'GARKAIT AN CLAIM An Effort Will lie Made To-Day to Tass It Over the President's Veto. Epecial to the Indianapolis Journal. Washington, Deo. 13L To-morrow will witness the interesting event of a Repub lican Senate acting upon the veto of a Re publican President - President Harrison's message, returning, without bis approval, the famous McGarrahan claim, will bo called up at 12: SO o'clock, and it is the con fident prediction of McGarrahan and his friends that the necessary two-thirds of tho Senate will vote in favor of the reso lutions, "that the bill becomes a law not withstanding the President's objection." They base their confidence on the fact that the bill passed the Senate by a practically unanimous vote, and that, therefore, there will be fifty-nine Senators wbo will vote agaiu in its favor. The Democratic House, they udd, will have much pleasure in pass ing the bill oyer a Republican executive's veto. . Should the bill be passed over the veto it will be the first instance of the kind dur ing President Harrison's administration. The President has not hesitated to with hold his approval of other measures. So far he has sent in fifteen vetoe s. Among them was tte bill creating the new Circuit Court of Appeals, which ho vet oed because of its defective legal construction. The bill was tho work of Senator Evarts. wbo was much disgusted to learn from the President's message that the bilL . as drawn by him. would practically have wiped out the Supreme Court of the United States. Ah reintroduced, with the objectionable features corrected, .the bill passed. A number of other bills which President Harrison ve toed, simply because of their legal faults, were approved by him when corrected. The other bills which did not admit of mod ification were referred to the committees from which they came and were never heard ot again. Among the measures thus abandoned was ex-Speaker Keed's bill to recompense the Portland company; a bill for a publio building at liar Harbor, whero Mr. Maine spends his summers, and a num ber of private claims Bills which were approved after correction prohibited book making in the District ot Ssumbia and established a Bureau of Records and Pen sions in the War Department. It is a noticeable fact that some of the moKt important statutes of the United States were created by bills passed over the vetoes of former Presidents. Among them are the reconstruction act. vetoed by Pres ident Johnson, and others are the civil rights law, the bill fur the creation of the freedman's bureau, the famons tenure-of-office act, and the Bland silver bill. The State of Nebraska was admitted into the Union through the bill granting it state hood, which was vetoed by President John son. Mr. Cleveland beat all previous records in the number and character of his vetoes. Strangely enongh, the only eftort to override his veto was made by one of his most ardent admirers in the Senate, Mr. Wilson, of Maryland, who bad ' interested , himaelt in a bill to pension one Romeiscr. and who looked upon President Cleveland's voto as questioning the truth and sincerity of Mr. Wilson's report. The Senate passed the hill over the veto, but it failed in the House. . rilKLIMlNAUY TO 

TARIFF REFORM. Financial Condition of the Government to He Inquired Into bj th Ilnnae. Washington, Dec. 13. The House opened to-day with a sharp contest between the ways and means and appropriations com mittees, but it was brief and decisive, and resulted in a victory for the former com mittee. For some time there has been a little rivalry between these two great com mittees of the House, and when the mat ter of ascertaining the financial condition of the treasury under, the opera tion of the McKmley law became a pertinent question, immediately after the ejection, this rivalry was accentuated by tho dispute as to which committee should conduot the investigation. Mr. DockeTy, ot the appropriations committee, introduceda resolution assigning this duty to the comtnitteo of which he is a member, and a few days later Mr. Wilson presented a resolution giving the work to the ways and means committee. Roth resolutions went to the committee on rules, and tha( committee to-day reported Mr. Wilson's proposition, thus conferring jurisdiction on the ways and means commute. Imme diately after the reading of tho report, Mr. Breckinridge, of Arkansas, a mem ber ot the ways and means com mittee of the last Con gross, but now of the appropriations commit tee, sprang to his feet, and sought to present a substitute resolution dividing the work between the two com mittees, conferring upon the ways and means committee the inquiry into the ef fect of the McKinlev law. and npon the ap propriations committee of tho financial condition of the treasury. To the pro posed substitute. Mr. Catchings, of the committee on rules, promptly objected, stating that Mr. Breckinridge' resolution should bo introduced and referred in the usual way, and declining, on behalf of the committee on rules, to accept any substi tute or nmendmeut whatever to the pend ing resolution. Alter some further discus sion, Mr. Breckinridge- withdrew his unb stitutr, and the resolution rocommended by tho committee on rules was unanimous ly adopted. - The resolution is as follows: liceolved, That the committee on ways and means he autlorized and Instructed to Inquire and report as to the present condition of the treasury aud the future probable revenues un der exittinc laws; and to that end the committee la particularly instructed to atcertaiu the amount, an near as nmy be, that will fee re quired tor the payment of pendens j rior to June HO, ls'J l; the amount of unexpended appropria tions and the amount required to complete works now authorized by the law; the items of the ttuujR to the credit of disbursing otticers; the items of probable revenues between this dace and June :;o, 18'J4, and the date at w hich the eaiue will be collected by the treasury, together with all other facta which mar be uselul to show the present and future condition of the treasury. The members of the ways and means committee were at once informally notified that a meeting of the committee would be held this week to begin the investigation. "The investigation will be mado by the full committee in open session," said Mr. Springer, "and not delegated to a sub-committee. It is important that this investiga tion should show the condition of tho treasury at mo me particular moment of time. As this is so near the end of the half fiscal year. the proper time at which the. condition of tho treasury should turn is the 31st day ot December, the ' end of the first half of the fiscal year. If we knew the obligations of the government on that day, the receipts from all sources atthat time and liabilities ot the government for the future we will know exactly how the government stands financially and be enabled to devise a plan lor meeting a possible deficit." . .The greater part of to-day's session of the Houe was consumed in the discussion of the bills referring the ancient Weil and LaAbra Mexicap awards to the Court of Claims to pass on the allegations ot fraud made in each case.

No result is expected to be se cured at tho present session of the confer ence Immigration Not au Unmixed Evil. Harper's Weekly. While readily admitting that in point of numbers we are receiving much more im migration than we need, yet we cannot close our eyes to the fact that it is extreme ly dillicult, if not impossible, to deviso a plan of restriction the practical execution of which would not in a large measure ex clude the desirable immigratioii together with the undesirable. Tne enactment. of such plans into laws would inevitably re sult in a conspiracy of very important and powerful interests to evade them. For the same reason the enactment of such laws will turn out to be politically impractica ble. The probability is that we shall have to make the beet of the law as it stand?, ex cluding paupers, idiots, criminals and soon, perhaps to strengthen ft by judicious amendments, keeping in view the limits of existing possibilities, and to employ every means atiorded by our political and social institutions to lead tho obstreperous for eign elements upon the path of good citi zenship. This task will, fspemlly as re gards the socond generation, appear far less hopeless than it now seems If well taken in hand. In the meantime we should deprecate the extravagant notion at present entertained by many well-meauing people that all the ills of our political and social condition are owing to the lnliux of igno rant and depraved persons trcm abroad. Those who take this ground wholly mij conceiv tbo origin and nature of many existing evils, and will bs apt to overlook necessities of reform and improvement which lie in an entirely dillerent direction.
