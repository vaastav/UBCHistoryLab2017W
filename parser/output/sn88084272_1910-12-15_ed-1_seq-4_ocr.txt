Siz thousand have already been sold in El Paso and 20,000 more have just ar rived. These stamps will be sold in the corridors of the postoffice and "every stamp is a bullet in the warfare against consumption." .The stamps make neat seals for Christmas packages, carrying as they do their message of good will to the Tecipient, and in using them, the work of the Red. Cross society in America in relieving distress among the indigent consumptives is given an impetus. The local officers of the Charity are anxious to make a record this year in the sale of these stamps. They sell for a cent apiece andonay be purchased in large or small Iqts. Every consumptive uncared for is a public danger. Yet only one-tenth of the cases are in the hospitals and sanatoriums of the country. That means that nine tenths of the victims are fighting the enemy in their homes, either intelligently or otherwise, but in both classes there is tremendous need for help, says a bulletin of theXEed Cross. The plan of the Christmas seal means a great recruiting for the army already enlisted to battle with the plague, declares the Philadelphia North American in comment. It is good fighting, for it shoots straight at the mark. It means a certain cure for many who would have gone uncured, "because the pennies and the dollars spent this seasonfor seals will be transformed speedily into life-saving milk and eggs. Above all, the plan is admirable because it is educational because it will help to teach both old and young that it is the duty of one andvall to help lift the burden of tuberculosis which weighs upon the whole community. Those are the practical material merits of the Red Cross stamps. .But there is another side. Those little "Merry Christmas" squares are gifts that not only -will do good,-but will do the giver good "hecause each of us willbe enriched by what is given. - - : All had people are not outside the church, just as all good ones are not in it. Lakewood, N. 3H., is to have a canning factory. Why can't El Paso get up a real "big stock company for such a concern? There is plenty of stuff already produced in the valley to start one and, with a ready market, there would be much more. o The school board appears to be in a pretty tad way financially. Does any body remember anything ever "being said about extravagances in school ex penditures? g A Louisville paper takes Texas to task for burning 'a Mexican at Rock Springs and the Pecos Times gets back by saying Texas "never disgraced itself by licensing a negress to practice law' as Kentucky did. Gee, what a come-back. Judson Harmon's presidential boom is being worked steadily, the dispatches say. Philander Chase Knox and Charles Warren Fairbanks at one time had presi dential booms steadily and continuously worked upon the American people, but we all know that all they got was expense bills for press clippings. Tributes To Remarkable Woman THE life and work of Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy, now that she has passed away, are drawing commendations from many of the most learned people of the time. Regardless of what her "science" may prove to be or what it has accomplished, she was a wonderful woman in many ways and she drew a remarkable following, including many very intelligent people. Mrs. Eddy, in the midst of the brighest age that the world has known, launched her "science" and won recruits by the thousands. The rich and the poor alike are numbered in the ranks of those who took up her teachings, and she won foi herself a place in the history of the century that is unique and will be lasting as a remarkable woman if nothing more. Rev. Thomas B. Gregory, "noted pulpit orator and writer, pays high tribute to Mrs. Eddy as a wonderful woman and says that regardless of whether she originated the ideas embodied in her book, she really originated the Christian Science church and that its growth alone is sufficient to have won fame enough for one woman. Declaring that Mary Baker Eddy is as much entitled to the honor of founding the Christian Science church as Christopher Columbus is entitled to the honor of discovering this western hemisphere, he says: "But what of this work? Answer the question as you will, it still remains true that it is a wonderful work! Millions of people, among the most intelligent to be found on -earth, from all the churches, and from outside of the churches, claim to have found in Christian Science the peace and health of mind and body that they were able to find nowhere else. Are all these people conscious deceivers? How uncharitable to claim such a thing! Are they themselves deceived, the poor dupes of an empty lie? How next to impossible it is to think that. It must be that they find real good in the church they have voluntarily entered, and from which they are perfectly free at any moment to depart. "However, this, it will be clearly understood, is not a brief for Christian Science or a. "blast against it. Quite apart from my individual views of it, Christian Science is here here, in all likelihood, to remain for a long, long time and the only thing about which there is no chance for an argument is the extraordinary, the amazing, personality of the frail little woman out of whose brain and will Christian Science was horn." i o In less than 60 days China is to be under constitutional government.

Few women like to ride in a car full of blue haze from cigarets and cigars and few men will suffer verymuch by having to wait until their journey is completed for a puff at the weed. A Philadelphia wife shot her husband because they could not agree whether the window should be open or closed. Other husbands and wives should take the hint and at least not fight over anything less 'than the number of covers for the bed.

Copyright, 1910. by Georg M&xtinnrw A PRINCE who is also a diplomat, who recently visited this country, when asked the bromidic ques tion what he thought of the American woman, made this wise reply: "The only fault I have ever been able to find with your American woman, either when I met her at home or abroad, is that she is bent on posing as a cosmopolitan. She is the most charm ing woman In the world when she is just herself, but she doesn't seem to know this. She keeps on trying to be an English woman, or a French woman, or some other kind of a woman anything, .so long "as it isn't an American woman and she goes to all sorts of trouble to do it, when she was much more the thing, dont you know, when she was just herself. It's a beastly shame, and somebody ought to tell about what a mistake she is making." Thafs-about the most discerning and discriminating and deserved criticism that has ever been passed upon the American woman, and she would do well to heed it, for it's true, every word of it.

You ought to be helping me entertain peo ple. Let me see, now; what Is It you're so clever at? Ah, of course the very thing." Mr. Boyson, guessing what was com ing, reddened and began to stammer. "Oh, no; I can't accept any excuses, really." Mrs. Wenlock raised her voice. "Listen, mease, everybody. I dare say you've all heard about Mr. Boyson's j conjuring. Well, he has pronysea to show us some " He muttered a frantic suggestion. "Oh, well, then, directly after supper, so that the room can he cleared a bit. Promise to show us some tricks," she concluded triumphantly. Mr. Boyson found all eyes focused upon him, some in pitying superiority, others in contemptuous amusement or polite surprise. He groaned inwardly. "I won't do it," he vowed. I I'll say I'm ill, or something." But Mrs. Wenlock had disappeared, and when at length he found her she laughed at all his protestations. From then till supper time he moved restlessly, the picture of misery; and, although he sat down to the meal he could hardly eat a morsel. He thought of maklhg a desperate appeal to Miss Wenlock; but she had vanished. At last a maid touched his shoulder to arouse him. "We've arranged the chairs, sir; and your box has come. And, please, the missis says will you kindly see if there's anything more youwant." "N-no," declared Mr. Boyson sepul chrally. "Nothing." ' She waited, however, so he rose and followed her. "A screen, then, if you don't mind; and er " He mumbled a confused request. He could escape directly afterwards, he decided frantically once the piti ful exhibition was over. Then the house and Hilda Wenlock should know him no more. Dully he busied himself In the few preparations neces sary. His hostess looked in. "All ready? Now, do come back and finish your supper.

THE representatives of the steam boat lines which carry passen gers on the waters of the United States are now in session in Washing ton. They have a national association for the mujtual promulgation of traffic rules and regulations. The rise of the railroad has brought with it the de cline of the steamboat as a passenger I carrier, but the steamboat men are hopeful that the crusade of the rivers and harbors congress will result in the return of the steamboat to popular fa- j vor. When the canal from Chicaero to ; tne Mississippi is completed and the rlv- er is deepened to St. Louis the boats may find a profitable carrying busi ness.

Gasoline power boats are included as steam vessels in this enumeration, which largely explains the surprise of these figures. When president Taft recommended in his message that a law should be en acted to prohibit any transcontinental railroad from owning or being in any way interested in any vessel passing 'through the Panama canal, "he based this -recommendation on the fact that tho railroads usually have found it good policy to steamboat lines dominate competing so that the natural advantages of water transportation could not be used as a club to force i flown railroad rates. Commerce of the Mississippi. With the possible exception of the delta-draining Nile, no other river in the world's history has borne upon Its waters the commerce that was floated on the Mississippi during the three de cades of the middle of the last century. In 1850 there were few railroads west of the Alleghenles, but tne wheat fields of Minnesota and the northwest were commanding the attention of the whole country. At the same time the planta tions of Louisiana, Arkansas, Missis sippi and Tennessee with their acres or cotton and sugar cane, their cattle, hogs, potatoes and other products were the richest in the south.

But "when, after balancing an apple on his wand and banishing it to the chimney, he found there the fruit in side half a dozen boxes carefully pack ed, he literally stacgered. Some queer outside influence was at work. Such, however, was his success that even a final weakly, humorous episode j was wen receivea. "I will step behind the screen. When it Is removed, you will no longer be able to see me. There! What did I Hell you?" Switching on the electric light again, he bowed modestly.

"Outsiders wouldn't understand, would they?" He swung round at the mischievous voice behind him, and met Miss Hilda Wenlock's Innocent gaze. "It was you!" "H'sh!" she urged in a whisper. "Wait till they've started games." Mr. Boyson's heart beat tumultuously. When she slipped out, giving him a backward glance, he followed ecstati cally into the deserted hall. "You've carried it off very well, con sidering. Thought I'd give you a bit of extra help.

Hey, presto! and what ap pears?" "This!" retorted the conjurer boldly. "Wonder if it'll fit your finger." "I knew you'd brought it," observed Miss Wenlock shylj-. "Saw you exam ining it in the passage. I was looking over the banisters. Some people take things too much for granted! Fancy getting this before you'd as much as asked me well," you wanted a lesson!" "So that's why you've been with Her bert Pinsent nearly all the evening?"

But the romance and adventure of steamboat life are not to be found in the account bdoks of the packet compa nies, but rather among the passengers who (rave color and varletv to everv who gave color and variety to every trip. The river gambler was not a mythical figure. He was one cf the most picturesque characters of our ear ly history. Few stories of the old south fail to mention the suave individual who inveigles the wealthy planter into a cramp of "cvariV" whpn thp Inttpr is- returning from St. Louis or the east, his belt laden with $20 gold pieces, the yield of his cotton sacks. And in most of these stories one finds the planter, stripped to his last penny, fi nally staking his faithful body servant or his beautiful quadroon slave on the last hand at draw poker. The upper Mississippi had a class of gamblers all its own. Here the sharp ers were accustomed to work fn pairs. The two seldom boarded the steamboat at the same time nor did they ever recognize each other. They became j acquainted with their victims individ ually ana were men miroaucea 10 eacu other by the deluded settler on his way to the wheat fields of Minnesota with the savings of a life time in the east. The gamblers of the 50s were tolerated j by the steamboat owners because they were constant travelers, and promoted the bar business of the boat, although they themselves kept their own private bottles cf colored water to be served by the saloon keeper Instead of rum which would have shaken their nerve and thus destroyed their "business" perspicacity. Historic Steamboat Races. Steamboat racing gave variety and spice to the life on the Mississippi. One of the most thrilling contests was that between the "Grey Eagle'.' and the "Itasca" on the upper Mississippi. This race is intimately connected with In ternational achievement as the follow ing facts show.

The Grey Eagle was 61 miles further from St. Paul than the Itasca but Capt Harris determined to be the first to deliver the message to the president.

The Itasca was proceeding leisurely on its way, uncon scious of the efforts of its rival, until j . the latter was seen to turn a bend in the river only a short distance behind. Then the Itasca realized that the Grey Eagle meant to capture the honor of being the first to deliver the message to the president.

WEETEST MTJMSIE: Mrs. Caton and Charlotte have gone and I have enioyed their visit so much. I think they enjoyed it, too. I have grown so fond of Mrs. Caton, just as you said I would. She is sweet and dear. We have had some such lovely talks about Bobby. I wish I had known him when he was a baby, he must have been the cunnlngest, most wonderful baby ever born. It makes me half jeal ous when I think of how sweet he was and I wasn't even born. One day when we had been looking over all his baby pictures and having a I'u-pIv alk about him. Mrs. Caton took my face between her two hands and saia, '"Peggy, my dear little daugh ter, I feel quite sure that you are the woman of all the world to make my boy happy. He Is very like his dear father, quick tempered,- but loving, and always ready to forgive." "The Bitter With the Sweet." And then she went on: "You must be patient with him. dear, and remember that his impulsive nature sometimes prempts him to do things that he after- wards deeply regrets. The women who J marry Catons, my dear, must take the bitter with the sweet; and, oh! the j sweet, my Peggy, is Very, very sweet.!
