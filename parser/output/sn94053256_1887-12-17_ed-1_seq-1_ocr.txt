WATERBUM, COM., SATURDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1887. PRICE THREE CENTS. VOL. 1. NO. 12. r J GOMPERS ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR. The Attitude of the Federation Toward the Knights of Labor Clearly Defined A Resolution Advocating; Arbitration, with a Sympathy for Ireland Amend ment. Baltimore, Dec. 17. At yesterday's morn ing session of the American Federation ol Labor a proposition was submitted provid ing for a per capita assessment of fire cents per week in cases of strikes or lockouts where it may be deemed necessary. The question was referred to a popular vote of the affiliated unions, to report at the next convention. The convention favored boy cotting in cases of necessity. "" At the afternoon session au ineffectual at tempt was made to further increase the president's salary to $1,500. A com munication was read suggesting the adoption of a uni form label for all union made goods. Cons'deration o f the report of the committee on con : stitutiou vi as then resumed. The re port of ..the com mittee as emended was adopted and substituted for the ; 

SAMUEL GOMPERS. Old COns! itutiotl. The report of the treasury committee was adopted. It regrets that many associations have failed to pay their per capita tax. The report of the committee on efficers was then submitted. It suggested that two delegates be selected to attend the congress of trades unions in London in 1888. This was stricken out, the federation contenting itself with recommending that tra les unions send delegates to that congress. The report also recommended a reduction in the hours of labor and to obtain better legislation for workingmen. It had the following in refer ence to the Knights of Labor, which was adopted by a rising vote: The growth of the Federation is due to the fact that the men who are employed in any par ticular branch of industry understand the nature of it and the difficulties connected with it better than those who are unacquainted with the trade, and have therefore resolved to join the organiza tion that accords them the risrht of self-control that the strikes whicn have taken place within the post few years in connection with thus K. of L. hnve made the members of that body discon tented with the management of their affairs, as it has been customary to allow strikes involving tens of thousands of men to take place, and after their local funds were exhausted order them back to work. There is a strong sentiment pre vailing and rapidly increasing among working men that open organizations are best. The atti tude of the Knights of Labor towards many of the trades unions connected with the American Federation of Labor has been anything but friendly, and while their declaration of principles advocates assistance to trades unions, their prac tices in many cases have been entirely foreign to those principles. While we agree tliata conflict is not desirable on our part, we also believe that the party or power which seeks to exterminate the trades unions of this country should be met with unrelenting opposition, whether that power consists of millionaire employers or men who title themselves Knights of Labor. President Gompers introduced a resolution expressing satisfaction at the efforts being made to establish a treaty between the United States and Great Britain looking to the settlement by arbitration of all questions difficult of solution through tho ordinary diplomatic channels, and thanking Wm. R. Cremer, M. P., for his exposition of the object of his visit to this country. Mr. Joseph Wilkinson tacked on the following amendment: And we also extend our sympathies to the peo ple of Ireland in their struggle for salf-govern-ment, and condemn the present policy of the British government in the coercion of the Irish people. Referred to committee. The following officers were elected for the ensuing year: President, Samuel Gompers, New York; first vice-president, Daniel Mc Laughlin, Braidwood, Ills.; second vice president, William Martin, Pittsburg; secre tary, P.

VEXED QUESTION IN CONGRESS. Republican Consultations in Anticipation of Democratic Action. Washington, Dec 17. The Republicans cf the house have been holding informal con sultations upon the tariff question, and talk ing the matter over generally to see how they stand. Mr. Reed, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Mc Kinley and others have been going about among those members as to whom they were in doubt and taking soundings, with the view of securing harmonious action. They have gradually pared their proposition down from what they would like it to be to make it ac ceptable to their members who lean toward tariff reform until they have got it down to where they think they can all agree. They have decided to meet any proposition brought forward by the Democrats with one of their own, which they will propose as a substitute. They have not definitely and finally decided upon the character of this substitute, as to every matter of detail, and they cannot until they learn more of what the Democrats are going to propose. They will shortly hold a more formal coDferencj for a final adoption of the p!an. As it stands now it is uncertain whether or not they will proposa to take the tax off sugar. They have agreed as to tobacco, but they still have some things to consider before settliug the question as to sugar. . ' Business Failures. New York, Dec. 17.

REPUBLICANS STILL AT IT I SECOND DAY'S PROCEEDINGS AT THE NEW YORK CONVENTION. A Generous Reception Accorded Hon. William E. Chandler as He Feces tho Audience Blaine' Name StiU Evokes Cheers A liquor Resolution. New York, Dec. 17. After Temporary Chairman Ryan had called the convention of Republican clubs to order yesterday fore noon the names of the clubs represented were read out. There were 350 in all, repre sented by 1,353 delegates. As the names of John Sherman, U. S. Grant, Charles Sum ner, John A. Logan, Ben Wade and James G. Blaine 'were read there was continuous applause. As on the first day, every refer ence to Blaine brought forth uproarious ap plause. To listen to the report of the committee on rules and order of business was the first matter to be at tended to, and Sen ator William E. Chandler, of New Hampshire, step ped forward as chairman of the commit tee and made the report. Mr. Chandler's ap pearance sent the convention into an hysteria of ap plause, and he con descended to smile while the delegates William e. chandler. refused to do anytbiug but yell. At last Mr. Chandler was allowed to read his report, which was very concise. Gen. Robinson, of Binghamton, N. Y., offered a resolution favoring increased har bor defenses. A resolution which caused a sensation was offered by Mr. Grosvenor, of Ohio. It was one denouncing tli6 appoint ment of Secretary Lamar to the supreme bench. All resolutions were referred with out debate. . The following resolution was offered by Mr. Birdsall, of Binghamton, whom Tempo rary Chairman Ryan called "Burchard:" Resolved, That the sense of this convention is that the present tariff an 1 internal revenue tax on whisky and tobacco should be maintained, and the net proceeds from whisky and tobacco be divided among the states, according to the population, to go toward the payment of the taxes on real estate. as the best means of dispos ing of the surplus. Senator Wilii'im M. Evarts, who was unan imously chosen permanent chairman, made one ot his characteristic speeches on assum ing the position. After thanking the con vention for the nonor conferred upon him he went into a brief review of the president's message, and urged the necessity of paying attention to the charges of election frauds at the south. At the conclusion of Mr. Evarts' address Mr. Boyle, of Ohio, presented the report of the committee on permanent organization of clubs.: The report strongly advocated the organization and was accompanied by drafts for constitutions of national and state leagues. After the report of the committee on per manent organization had been read and adopted a resolution was adopted that the delegations meet and select a vice-president and secretaries and present their names to the convention. A vote of thanks was tendered Mr. Ryan for his able and impartial services as tempo rary chairman. At 1:30 recess was taken until 3 p. m. During the recess tbe various delegations met at their hotel headquarters. It was 4 o'clock when the onvention reassembled. During the recess the New York delegates had met at the Grand Opera house and caucused for candidates for officers of the proposed national league. They had pre pared the following list: President, Chaun cey M. Depew, New York; vice-president, James E. Blanchard; executive committee man, Edgar T. Brackett. As soon as chairman Evarts called the body to order there were loud cries of "Goff," and Gen. Nathan Goff, of West Virginia, responded by a speech, in which 1 told why the Republicans south of Mason and Dixon's line were Republicans. It was because the party represented protection to American labor and industry, and universal education. Mr. Goft referred twice incidentally to Mr. Blaine, in naming the possible candi dates of the party, and both times there was a sensational demonstration of approval. After Mr. Goff's speech the committe on platform reported. The platform recounts the virtues of tho Republican party and has this to say of the president's message : The president had descended from the dignity of his office so far as to convert his constitutional duty into a partisan speech for the overthrow of a policy recommended by the founders of the government. The platform goes on to give the history of the protective tariff, and to ascribe the growth of the country to its beneficent effects, inconsequence of these benefits,' the platform goes on to say, the Repuolican party refuse to abandon the protective policy, as to do so would ruin our industries and throw laborers out of work for the benefit of the British. The presi dent's message is further described as an invita tion to the American people to support the laborers and manufacturers of Europe instead of our own. The Republican party would render America independent of Europa. As to the sur plus, the Republican party put it down when in power by reducing taxation. The Democrats have shown themselves unable to do so, but pro pose tojreduce it by making us the commercial slaves of Europe. The platform then charges the Democratic party with various offenses against the pub lic good, and confidently appeals to the sup port of the country. The resolutions as read were approved in speeches by Wm. Marie of Maryland, Mr. Wolff of Wnshington,Col. A. Loudon Snow den of Philadelphia, Speaker Noyes of Mas sachusetts, John Mitchell (colored) of Vir ginia, and others. When the question on adoption of the re port was reached, Mr. Eustis, of Minnesota, called for action first on his resolution op posing Mr. Lamar's confirmation as supreme court justice, but he was ruled out of order and the report was unanimously adopted. Mr. Eustis then tried to again offer his Lamar resolution, but Chairman Evarts said the resolution was in the hands of the com mittee and Mr. Eustis was out of order. E. T. Brackett, chairman of the New York delegation, moved that the Lamar resolution be recalled from the committee. Mr. Rifle, of Massachusetts, said the convention should not throw mud at any man. Others ex pressed the same view, and Capt. A. J. Cun ningham, of Washington, moved to adjourn. Hon. John A. Kasson, of Iowa, seconded the motion, and it was carried. An nudience of moderate number listened at Chickering hall last night to speeches by Col. John Atkinson, of Michigan; Galusha Grow, of Pennsylvania ; Hon. II.. G. Horr, of Michigan; Judge King, of Youngslown, O.; Wallace Bruce, of Poughkeepsie; A. J. Lester, of Illinois, and others. Mr. Horr, in his speech, favored local option and declared that the condemnation of intemperance iu s.'i'tei in the platform placed tho Repub lican party right on tho liquor question." A 

FEARFUL BOILER EXPLOSION. Five Persons Instantly Killed and Many . Dangerously Wounded. West Chester, Pa., Dec. 17. Five per sons were killed and as "many more injured yesterday afternoon by- the explosion of one of tbe boilers in the works of the Edison Electric Illuminating company. The killed are T. Walter Embree, the superintendent of the works, head blown nearly off and body badly crushed; Elwood Becket, colored bod carrier, body terribly . scalded and crushed; Mary Jones, a school girl, 14 years of age, struck on the head and died instant ly; Samuel Webb and John Bradley, colored laborers. The injured are: Edward Schofield, a lineman, badly scalded and crushed, in jured internally, and will die; Frank Kin nan, a lumberman, scalded f about the face and slightly bruised; William Richardson, a fireman, scalded and cut on ike head; Jacob Brown, a laborer, seven cutajtra head: Wil liam Allison, a laborer, legs cut and badly scalded. D. O. Taylor, clerk of the courts, and several workmen whoso names are not known, are missing. The explosion was terrific. For squares away the houses were shaken and windows broken. The big building was almost de molished, and large pieces of iron machinery were thrown hundreds .of feet in the air. Many bricks and pieces of . iron and wood were found several squares, away. Before the smoke and steam had half cleared away the tall and heavy smokestack fell with a crash, knocking down ; the-, walls of the building, which were still standing, and burying the men who had before stood some chance of getting out alive.- fc- Work was immediately begun to extricate the living, and then attention was turned to the dead. There was known to have been at least ten persons in tbe building when the boiler blew up. In half an hour all of those still living had been dug out. None of them is thought to be dangerously wounded except Lineman Schofield. The physi cians say it will be impossible for him to live. Two or three of the others aree severely scalded. - Supt. T. Walter Embree's body was tbe last one to be recovered. It presented a ghastly appearance. A piece of iron or wood had struck him on the head, almost severing it. Mary Jones, the little school girl, was walking a square away at the timo of the explosion. A heavy plank struck her and crushed her skull. She was instantly killed. The bodies of Webb and Bradley were not found until after dark. It is feared other bodies may be unier the debris. . . A DANDY DEFAULTER. He Wore Good Clothes at the Expense of Depositors. Philadelphia, Doc. 17. Tbe systematic course of robbery which - Joseph G. Knight, the arrested defaulter of the Manufacturers' National bank, carried on for twenty years, is the main topic in mercantile and social cir cles. President Moffley, of tbe bank, said that Knight's relatives are very wealthy and could have raised the $65,000 stolen in a few hours had they .undertaken the task. One of the directors, when asked to explain why the fraud was not detected, said that there was only one way to prove Knight's accounts, and that was to add tbe individual deposits up daily and see if the column footings were correct. The directors never thought of doing this. Knight was noticeable for his neatness and ' rather dandified appearance and looks younger than he really is. He always dressed in the best of fashion and boasted of wearing a fresh suit of underclothes every day. He wore as many as three and some times four or five different 6uits a week, and had a different hat for each kind of weather. Regularly every morning he would ride down town in a street car as far as the cor ner of Chestnut and Thirteenth streets and then walk down the former thoroughfare to the bank at Third street. The other clerks told him he did this to show off his good clothes. It is thought that the slack meth ods of running business at the bank prior to 1679 gave Knight a chance to take a little money. Mrs. Robinson's Trial Concluded. Boston, Dec 17. Arguments were con cluded yesterday afternoon in the trial of Mrs. Robinson for poisoning several of her family. The prisoner was then given the usual opportunity to address the jury. She consulted her counsel and then arose and said: "Your honor, my counsel advises me to say nothing, but I must say here that I am not guilty." Mrs. Robinson spoke in a low aud tremulous voice. She fainted while leaving the court room at the recess which followed. When court reopened Judge Knowlton charged the jury, who retired, and the court adjourned until to-day. Restrained from Issuing Watered Stock. Harrisburg, Pa., Dec. 17. Judge Simon ton granted a preliminary injunction yester day restraining the officers of the Newcastle aud Shenango Valley railroad company from issuing fictitious stock. An affidavit from J. A. Haines, of Lawrence county, states that thse officers purcbasad the road for the sum of $30,100, and afterwards issued stock to tbe amount of $250,000, for which no consideration was paid other than $30,100. Haines also says the road can be built for $110,000, and that any stock issued over that amount and the sum paid as pur chase money is fictitious. The Other Side of the Story. New York, Dec. 17. The Star to-day publishes a statement of tbe affairs of the Tortilita mines, contradicting the allega tions recently made by The Herald against the management of the property. The mines are shown to be in actual operation on a paying basis, and the character of the managers is supported by testimonials from men of the highest national reputation. The article of incorporation show the capitaliza tion to be $1,000,000, not the extravagant sum of $20,000,000, as has been asserted. Suits have been instituted against The Her ald for slander. The Fastest Time Ever Made. Cincinnati, Dec. 17. The Cincinnati Southern railroad in connection with the Western Atlantic will establish on Monday next the fastest schedule ever maintained between Cincinnati and Jacksonville, Fla. Their "Limited" leaving in the morning will arrive at Atlanta the same evening, Macon, Albany and Waycross, the next morning, and connecting with the fast mail arriving at Jacksonville at 12 o'clock noon. The schedule of twenty-eight hours between Cincinnati and Jacksonville is the fastest ever made. The Thoebe-Carllsle Contest. Washington, Dec. 17. It is probable that the Thoebe-Carlisle case will not be settled in committee until after the holidays. As the case now stands there is only a question of law involved, which con be settled on its merits and requires no testimony. Most of the members of the committee have read the papers presented by Mr. Thoebe, and it re mains for them only to consult authorities as to the law. This they will probably be inclined to postpone until the holiday recess. It is likely that the report of the committee will be unanimously favorable to Mr, Carlisle. THE 

RUSSIAM BEAR GROWLS. THE MASSING OF THE ARMIES ON THE FRONTIER. It Causes Increased Excitement in Aus tria, while the Csar's Attltnde Remains Defiant He Neither Desires Nor Fears War -Germany Wants More Soldiers. Vienna, Dec 17. At the opening of the Bourse yesterday there was almost a pnnic on tbe announcement being made that Premier von Tisza of Hungary had been summoned to attend a council of ministers at Vienna. Later, the Journal de St. Peters bourg's article disclaiming Russia's responsi bility for the present state of affairs in Europe helped the recovery of the market. Still, Austrian and Hungarian securities c o-ed at a decline of 1 to 7 per cent. Pesth, Dec 17. The Austrian press are unanimously of tbe opinion that the article published in the St. Petersburg Official Mil itary Gazette in relation to the military preparations of the powers has greatly in creased the acuteness of the situation. Tbe Pesther Lloyd says Austria must make military preparations involving large ex pense. Tbe paper also states that it is un true that Roumania will, in the event of war, place two army corps on the Russian frontier. Roumania will in any event re main neutral. Well informed persons be lieve that Russia may threaten, but that she will not venture to challenge the triple alliance. St. Petersburg, Dec. 17. The Official Military Gazette article favorably impressed tbe public mind as exactly expressing the national feeling. Russia neither desires nor fears war. The Journal de St. Petersbourg says: "Every impartial judge will admit that Russia is not responsible for the continuous re-enforcements and the condition of armed peace." Berlin, Dec. 17. According to the Reichsanzeiger's version of Gen. Von Schell endorfTs speech on the military bill yester day, the minister of war said that the object of the bill could bo perfectly summed up in the words of tbe emperor on the opening of parliament, that the empire, by God's help, should become so strong that it could meet every danger with calmness, from whatever quarter it might be attacked. The minister, continuing, said that danger threatened not from the warlike disposition of allied powers, for German people always leaned toward peace, but from attacks by other people. The empire was strong, and it had allies, but in war its might depended only upon its own strength. It must be made so powerful that it would be feared as a foe and courted as an ally. The bill aimed to increase considerably the numerical strength of the army through extension of tbe term of service in the Landsturm. The additional strength given will be of great value, and with the physical hardiness of the Germans no difficulty will be experi enced in giving effect to the provisions of the bill. The Germans, he felt sure, would not be sparing of their powers when the time came for beating off the enemy. Paris, Djc. 17. In the chamber of depu ties yesterday Gen. Logerot, minister oi war, asked a military credit of 11,000,00(1 francs, and was supported by the budget committee. The chamber, however, by a vote of 395 to 225, adopted an amendment by M. Brice, granting only 4,000,000 francs. Beat His Own Record. Baltimore, Dec. 17.
