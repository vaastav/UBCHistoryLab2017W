Events have shown that It Is not possible adequately to secure the enfrr?ement of any law of this kind by incessarl appeal to th. courts. Th. da partment of Justice has for the last four V"--! devoted more attention to th. en forcement of the anti-trust legislation than to anything else. Much has been accomplished; particularly marked has been the moral effect of the prosecutions; but It Is Increasingly evident that there w!K be a very Insufficient beneficial re sult In the way of economic change. The successful prosecution qf one device .to evade the law Immediately develops an otht r device to accomplish th. same pur pose. What Is needed Is not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to restrict com petition, but such adequate supervision and regulation as will prevent any re striction of competition from btjlng to the detriment ol the publlc-s well as such supervision and regulation as will prevent other abuses In no way connected wltti restriction of competition. Of these abuses, perhaps the chief, although by no means the only one, Is overcapltalisa-tlon-generally Itself the result of dishon est promotion because of th. myriad .vlls it brings In Its train; for such over capitalisation often means an inflation that invites business panic; It always con ceals the true relation of the profit earned to th. capital actually Invested, and It creates a burden of Interest payments which Is a fertile cause of Improper re duction in or limitation of wages; It damages the small Investor, discourages thrift, and encourages e-amhllSBT Saul dMntlEM'SSSSS.

In view t th. enormous development of great busin.se agencies. usuauy corpo..- lorm.

Such regulation and supervision can only fee .ttectlvoly exercised by a sovereign whose Jurisdiction ts coextensive with me field of work ol the corporations that Is, by the national government. I believe that this regulation and supervision esa be obtained by th. enactment of law by the congress If tbl. proves Impossible. It will certainly be necessary ultimately to confer la fulleM form such power upon th. national government by a proper amendment of the constitution. I wostld obviously bs unwise to endeavor to secure auch en amendrn.nl until It 1. eerta'n that the mult cannot be obtained under th. constitution as It now Is. The laws -of the congress and of the several staffs bltherto, as passed upon by the courts, have resulted more often la showing, that the state, have no power la the matter than that the national government baa power; ao that then at present exists 4V Terr unfortunate condition of things, sjoder which these great corporations do ing aa Interstate huelaen occupy the po aritio of .objects without . sovereign, either any state govern meat nor the aa tlooal government having effeetire eon- trol over them.

The flro! . l i . . j i. ... jm with tha axeat corporation, engaged In th. bu.lne.s of interstate transportation, ae t aau In my message of December last, the Immediate and most pressing needle, far a. legislation la conoerned. is the enactment Into law of some scheme to ..cur. to th. agent, of th. gov.rn- - i. anil papulation of th. rates charged by the railroads of the country engagea in in.-,- traffic aa .hall aummarlly and effeo- livety prrvain ma mhiww.. or unreasonable rate.. It mu.t Include putting a oompiete eiop m , c-.-- ... every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the huslneaa world, ahould be es erclsed with moderation, caution and self-restraint; but It .hould ealst so that It can bo effectively exercised when the need arisen. The first con.lderatlon to be kept mind Is that the power should be alTlrmatl" -- should he given to some administrative body created by the congress. If given to the prent Interstate commerce commission or to a reorganised Interstate commerce commission, such commission should be made unequivocally administrative. I do not believe In the government In terfering with private bualneeo man than la neeeeeary. 1 do not believe In the government undertaking any work which can with propriety be left la private hands.

The best possible regulation of rate, would, of course, be that regulation secured by an honest agreement among the rallroada themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for Instance at once put a stop to th. .ffort. of any on. big shipper or big railroad to dis criminate agalnat or secure advan tage. over some rival; and such agree ment would ma, the railroads them selves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested In the Bovernment to nut a stop to agreement, to the detriment-. the public should , Ir i my ludsrment be accompanied by power to permTt "Oder specltled condlt on. and careful supervision, agreements clear ly In the interest of the public. But n my Judgment, the necessity for giving this further power Is by no Sean; a. great a. the necessity tor irlvlng the commission or administra tive body the other powers I have enumerated above; and It ( may weU he Inadvlaable to attempt to yest this particular power In the comm sslon or Mher administrative body until It al ready possesses and Is exercising what "regard a, by far th. most Important of all the powers I recommend as In Seed the vitally Important power Ihat to fix a given maximum rate, which rate after the lapse of a rea.on "h,. time. goe.

Only In thl. way can violations or svsslons of ihs law be surely detected.

It Would not be necessary for them to as amln. Into tb. account, of any railroad unless lor good reason. th.y were direct ed to do so by the Interetat. commerce commission.

The department of commerce and labor should also make a thorough Investiga tion of the conditions of women In In dustry. Over 6,000.000 American women are now engaged in gainful occupations: yet there Is an almost complete dearth of data upon which to base any trust worthy conclusions as regards a subject as Important as It Is vast and compli cated.

Aa a remedy for this evil of conflicting, ineffective, and yet bur densome regulation, there ha. been for many year, a widespread demand for federal .up.rvl.lon.
