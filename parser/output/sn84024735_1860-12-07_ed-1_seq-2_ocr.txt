( We should do violence to our own feelings, ; did wo omit an especial expression of high approbation for the conduct of the five Democratic electors on the occasion of the assemblage of the Electoral College, on Wednesday last. These gentlemen were placed in a position of great difficulty and much delicacy. The difficulties presented to their mature consideration. were, indeed, much greater than may appear to a careless observer. In the first place, they knew that certificates of election had been issued to them, in consequence . of executive decisions on points merely technical ; in other words, that the issue of such certificates was accidental. On the other hand, they could not but know, Irotn the unmistakable indications of the late election, that a large majority of the voters preferred their election to that cither of the Bell electors, or of the Douglas electors, and that, in fact, the popular will would be best fulfilled by the casting of their votes for Breckinridge and Lane; in other words, they knew that the legal election of the Bell electors was as much an accident, as was the legal issue of certificates of election to the Democratic electors. Again, they knew that the certificates issued to llicin, woulu enable them to cast a part only of the electoral vote of the State, actually less in proportion to the whole electoral vote, than the vote really cast for them showed in comparison with the whole popular vote of the State. These considerations were backed not only by put ty attachments, but by patriotic feeling. They knew that their refusal to cast the vote would enable it to be cast not only for a candidate who was not the popular choice of the State, but for one whose opinions and 1 whose public conduct tney regarueu as uinering only in degree, and not in kind, from those ' of Abraham Lincoln. The whole matter was made the subject of ( searching examination antiserums consultation. All endeavored loyally to unite in a right decision. Acid that the decision in which they did finally unite was the right decision, we entertain no doubt whatever. The one fact before them, that no plurality of the popular vote had been actually and intentionally east in favor ( of their election, was made the sole ground- j work of their decision. However unmistaka- i b!e may have been the indications of popular prefcrcuce, they knew that that preference, in ] their case, had not been explicitly declared; j and they were unwilling to fulfil their own ? preference upon any ground of mere presump- 1 tion, however strong, either of law or of fact. In a word, their action was that of Virginia J gentlemen, guided by the most delicaro sense r of public responsibility and personal honor. It r is to us a matter of the most sincere coDgratula- 2 tion that distinguished citizens of Virginia are , W . . t fouDd thus to rise to the full dignity of their high- < est duty,especially at a moment when the trying t exigencies of our national afiairs demand that f selfish inclinations and party preferences shall be cast aside, and our public men shall be a guided only by motives nbove the possibility 1 of doubt. We also sincerely trust that none but the b best consequences can result from such a scru- * pulons regard to the purity of purpose and r propriety of action. On this point the Rich- 0 mond "Whig," of yesterday, justly observes: b "If our public men had been actuated always * by the sense of honor, and the regard for fair- r play, that have controlled these gentlemen, the s past would have lbwer bitter memories?the t future fewer darkened hopes." * We arc proud also to bear witness before the c public, that it is beyond the power even of the ( most tortured conception, to apply this culo- 0 gium on his colleagues,, in any possible man- f ncr, to the discredit ortiur distinguished and ^ noble friend,the Democratic elector for the first v electoral district. Mr. Lamb's position was altogether different from that of his colleagues. There could be ho doubt nor question as to the c course which he ought to pursue. With or without the corrections made by Gov. Letcher, William Lamb undoubtedly received a popular vote groutcr than that cast for a number of the Bell electors. That ho was chosen elector by the people, he was not permitted to doubt, and he knew that a majority of the people preferred Breckinridge to Bell or Douglas either.? Under these circumstances, he had no choice. It was his imperative duty to attend the meeting of the electoral college, and cast one electoral voto for John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane. Ilad it been possible, we know this duty would have been fulfilled. That it was not fulfilled, his severe illness-furnishes the sole and ' sufficient excuse. Virginia Electoral College. \ The State Electors nssetnbled in the Senate Chamber, yesterday, pursuant to adjournment. At 11 o'clock, Francis T. Anderson, Esq., took the Chair and called the College to order. The Secretary then read the minutes of the proceedings of the previous day and they were duly signed by the Chairman and Secretary. Mr. Jackson then offered a resolution to the effect that the gentlemen receiving from the Governor his certificate of their election as Electors of President and Vice President of the United States, and who came to Richmond, but who failed to be present, were entitled to , mileage for coming to the seat of Governmect and returning to their respective homes. Mr. Johnson of Bedford opposed the resolution, not because he was at all opposed to p&yine the mileage alluded to, but because ho * doubted the legality of the College taking action in such a case. After considerable discussion, which indicatee, however, a desire on all hands to pay mileage, if possible, the resolution was adopted, there being but three noes. Mr. Bowden then otfered the following resolution : Resolved, That the thanks of this body be tendered to Francis T. Anderson, Esq., the chairman of this body, for the impartial and dignified manner in which ho has discharged his duties. This resolution was unanimously adopted, and the Chairman then returned thanks Jin an eloquent speech, in which he reviewed the present condition of the country and the causes which have led to that condi!tion. A resolution was then adopted giving an assistant of the Secretary $25 as compensation for services rendered during the session of the l college. J This resolution met with some opposition. " On motion of Mr. "Wyndham Robertson, the following words were added to the resolution offered by Mr. Jackson: "And we re( cognize, also, unanimously, the right of Messrs. ; Johnson. Staples, and Epcs;-to a similar allowI ance." " .v-The electors then clustered round the Secrei tary's table to get their certificates of mileage ' and per diem, (one of them humorously re| I I : I ~ larking, that that was the first chance he had | s f getting his hand in the public crib,) and C he certificates having been all issued by the I ecrctary, and tho certificates of election duly r ealed, and so forth, the college adjourned nine t lie?all their trouble being in vain, for John \ Jell and Edward Everett are just where they < rere before, to wit: outside the White House. mt > < View* of the Pre** on the lTIc?M?e. Various are the expressions of the press in '' egard to the President's message. We annex ' iome specimens which have come to hand from eading quarters. We shall endeavor to dissect j the document ourselves in a day or two. i j The Washington "Constitution" interprets ? <he message to mean, that the Southern States may secede if they please, without fear of cos?roion. Tt savs Mr. Buchanan conclusively exhibits the untenablcness of a position which would reduce sovereign States to the dependent standard of provinces, and would invest the Federal Government with the attributes of absolutism? ; in form, perhaps, recognizing Democralic principles, but in reality, laying the foundations of an oligafchy or a dictatorship. The most 1 strenuous advocates of Southern rights could not desire more explicit language than the President has employed; nor can any Northern man, intelligently appreciating the genius of the federal system, dispute the reasoning adduced in support of the position, or t!^^sequences to which it inevitably leads. .?\fter ! much serious reflection," Mr. Buclii^uC de- J Clares ho has "arrived at the conclusii^" Chat neither to Congress, nor to any other depart- 1 ment of the Government, belongs the power to * coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from the Confederacy." The inference is plain, 1 if not indeed expressed, that, in the judgment ! of Mr. Buchanan, Congress cannot Constitutionally confer upon the Executive power to ; employ military force as against Stai^which may secede. The "National Intelligencer" thus explains the contradiction which the President commits in denying the right of secession and yet holding that Congress has no right to use coercion to prevent secession : If the President's denial that our Federal Union is "a mere voluntary association of States" may seem to an}' in conflict with the opinion propounded in the sequel of his argument on this topic, when he holds that Congress has no power "to make war on a State," or to "coerce a State into submission," it is perhaps just to observe that this apparent logical contradiction springs from a failure to discriminate between the action of States and of individuals under a Government like ours. The laws of the United States, within the sphere of their jurisdiction, arc incumbent on the individual citizens of every State in the Union, and the Chief Magistrate being bound "to take care that the laws be faithfully executed," it obviously follows, as the message affirms, that "from this obligation he cannot be absolved by any human authority." If the spirit of disaffection and revolt in any State i has become so rife that to resist the contumacy of individuals is to resist the entire State, it may well be said that in such a crsc "coer- , cion, however clear in point of "right," would be little likely to prove a remedy. The logic ' of events must, doubtles, be respected as well as the logic of constitutional law, but the latter . is not required, for that reason, to lower its pretensions in the forum of argument. The New York Tribune bitterly attacks the ( President's arraignment of the Northern j States, but is of the opinion that what he says i "of the alleged right of secession, and the insxDediencv. if not iniDOSsibilitv. of coercion, is in the innin forcibly and well said." It con:ludes: i Ou the whole, though there is but a small j portion of the message as printed that we can I ipprove, we heartily thank the President for ;he four columns that, on revision, he omitted. The omission of another like amount would ' tare rendered it quite a respectable document. IVe thank him, moreover, lor the similar nies- 1 sages that he will refrain from writing through>ut the years to come. And, though we can- I lot commend the moral insensibility which t enders him unablo to see why any good citi:en should detest slave-hunting in free States, 1 ve can heartilj* congratulate him ou the fact i hat he is soon to bo relieved from the cares of State, and we assure him that in such relief he great body of the people will heartily svin>athize. F With regard to the want of Constitutional *' uthority to coerce a seceding Slate, the Xcw z 'ork Times says: It seems incredible that any man holding a iigh official position should put forth such an i rgument. It is not a question of war at all? ior is it a question between the State and Fedeal Government It is simply a question of bcdience to the laics of Congress?and the obigation rests upon the individual citizens of he Stale. It is their duty to obey those laws, nd the State has no authority to release them roin such obedience, because the Federal Contitution, and the laws made in pursuance v hereof, are expressly declared by the Const!ution itself to be the supreme law of the land -"anything in the Constitution or laws of any itate to the contrary notwithstanding." The Jovernrnent has precisely the same power to ^ nforce every law of Congress in South Caroli- t ia that it has to enforce tho fugitive slave law ( a Massachusetts. Mr. Buchanan docs not in- , oke tho war-making powers in the one case? < vhy should he in the other. . 1 The Times concludes: I I he .Message, in our juugeiuent, is an in- ; :endiary document, and tends still further to i jxasperate the sectional differences of the day. ] t backs up tho most extravagant of the de- : nands which have been made by the South, t ndorscs thoir menace of disunion if those de- < nands are not toncedcd?and promises the : seceding States that the power of the Federal i jovernmcnt shall not be used for their coercion, t Fhe entire North will be made doubtly indig- 1 lant by this flagrant dereliction of duty on the ( part of the Executive of the Nation, while the I Disunionists of the South will be stimulated to i fresh exertions in the work of ruin upon which they have embarked. The country ha6 i to struggle through three months more of this disgraceful imbecility and disloyalty to the ] Constitution. I The New York World, in an article general- i y commendatory of the Message, says: His views of the inadequacy of tiic alleged reasons for this formidable secession movement; >f the safety and the duty of further delibera- 1 lion and delay; of the restraints, favorable to j ronservatism, which tho responsibilities of jfficc will impose on Mr. Lincoln; of the absur- 1 iitj of secession when claimed as a constitutional right; and his construction of his own duties and powers under existing laws, are ' sound, and well suited to the grave exigency J they are intended to meet. But, when he proceeds to address Congress on its duties, his recommendations seem to us a great deal better than his reasoning. Whether the Federal Government has power | to coerce a State into submission will, at this j juncture, be thought a question of no practical ( iu4k UI m?: 

IV/UIIM> Vi-'1 u bably a great majority) who agree with the President that such a power ought not to be ixcrted, if the Constitution confers it If we ire not to cut this gordian knot, hut to untie t; if the country is to be extricated from these iifBculties, Dot by the strong arm, but by argument, by expostulation, by persuasion, by concession, it makes no difference whether :here is thunder sleeping in the national cannon or not Since Mr. Buchanan's recommendations are patriotic and statesmanlike, we are in no mood to quarrel with that part of his reasoning from which we dissent. In relation to the right of coercion, the Philadelphia American says: On this point we arc surprised to find that be has come to views quite at variance with those of the opening of his message. He believes that no power has been delegated to Congress to suppress revolution in a State; this government of so much power becomes powerless in the very crisis which tries its strength, [fresistancetothelaws are attempted by a State jtovernment, such resistance cannot be supjressed because to do so would bo making war m a State, in his argument; and if this posi;ion is correct, tho legal ties which bind the Jnion are less than ropes of sand. This part )f the message, if it were not extra-judicial, md therefore of no more value than any indiridual's opinion, would destroy the whole force >f the statements of duty which precede it, for f a President can acton principles so loose he lan destroy all law and order when he will.? irVe believe, however, that this part of the message was prepared in a,spirit of weak ronces- i lion to the disunion elements of the Cabinet ind was intended to cater to the prevailing 1 ientiment of disunion States. We regret this c uror, not because we advocate coercion, or as- s ft umo now to say what the fluty of the General r! government may be when t he exigency comes, 1 ?ut bccauso we deprecate the loosening of all j i estraints and the release of all penalties at a i c ime when such release directly incites to the a vorsc acts of treason to the only power which : t :an preservo the nation in peace. 1 [ Tho Philadelphia "Press" says that the Pre- |1 iident "could have offered no more grateful i . irgument to the disunionists" than that in re- ' iation to corcion, and adds : j.? The sum and substance of this Message, able : < is it is, amounts to a recommendation to the | I Southern States, who believe themselves to be ; 1 aggrieved, to leave the Union, and an encour- j ' agcrucnt that, in the event of their doing so, i 1 there is no authority to be found either in the | ' Constitution, or the laws under it, to punish | < them or call them back. We repeat that se- |' cession must end in civil war, and the sooner j the public mind settles itself upon this idea j1 the better.

It should be borne in mind that the s aim"of $09,848,474.72, included not only pay- t nents growing out of such appropriations as fl lad been estimated for by the department, but s ill other sums appropriated by Congress.? v There i.> no reason why the expenditure for the c iresent or next fiscal year should exceed that of he last year. Allowing, however, a margin b or an increase, it may be safely stated that ii he expenses for the two years will not exceed c tGO, Out 1,000 each making the amount to be a iroviiied for $120,000,000. The estimated o neans of the treasury for the same period are d or the present liscal year, $03,348,090.75, and w or the year ending June 20, 1802, $64,250,000* o vhich would leave an excess of estima- c ed means over estimated expenditure of p >7,593,990.75. it The estimates of receipts iuto the Treasury u iave been made without reference to the finan- j ial and commercial panic, which has assumed j it o threatening an aspect within the last few | tl I lays, and of which I shall speak more fully icreaftcr. The country was never in a more rrospcrous condition. Our planters and farm- j ;rs have been blest, as a general rule, with j ibundant crops, and were realizing remuncra- j ive prices for all kinds of products. The ex- j iorts of the last fiscal year had reached the mormons sum of $400,1*22,296, and the imports or the same period were $362,163,941, yield- j ng a revenue from customs of $53,1S7,511 87. [ The exports of domestic produce for the pre-1 sent fiscal year, as far as they have been re- j reived, indicate an increase fully equal, if not | treater, than that of preceding years, thus authorizing the estimate of increased revenue Torn that source. Apart, therefore, from the threatened embarrassments in the trade and ausiness of the country, these estimates, both )f expenditure and receipts, would he .submitted to Congress with great confidence that they would not vary very fnr from the actual rcsun*. It is impossible lo anticipate tlie effects svhich this threatened revulsion will produce upon the bnsiness of the country. The absence of all the ordinary causes for such a sta!e jf tilings leave no data upon which to make calculations?all the elements of prosperity are in existence?abundant crops with remunerative prices?money seeking safe investments? md, indeed, everything to indicate more than the usual increase in trade and business. The causes which have so suddenly arrested this tide of prosperity must be looked for outside of the financial arid commercial operations of the country; they are of a political character, and therefore so dependent for their ultimate effect upon future developments that it is impossible it present to say what will be the extent of their inilnencc. If, as some suppose, they arc merely temporary, and will soon pass away, then there will be no necessity for any action jf Congress, except to provide for the embarrassments already existing in consequence of them. If, on the other hand, the effect should prove more permanent, the fact will be made manifest during the present session of Congress, md in time for such action as will provide the necessary means to carry on the operations of the Government and preserve the public credit. Already has the Treasury been seriously jfleeted by these causes. The receipts from customs for the lust few days have greatly Fallen off, and the limited amount received is imposed each day of an increased proportion jf treasury notes, not yet due. The indications are that such will, at least, for the present, continue to be the case; not only so, hut n" consequence of the failure of bidders for the ale loan to comply witli the terms of their aid; a portion of the ordinary revenues has been withdrawn from the ordinary sources of expenditure to meet the payment of treasury rotes past due, and the interest thereon. This :o.'.idition of tilings demands the immediate ittention of Congress, and its early action will jc required to enable the Department to carry >n the operations of the government, and at lie same time unserve unimpaired the public :rcdit. The permanent public debt on June SO, ISfiO, vast $45,079,203 OS, and the outstanding rcusury notes .v that date amounted to ! 19,600,500, as wi.l appear by reference to iho able Ko. 8, hereto appended. Dj* the act of June 22, 1S60, provision was nade for the redemption of treasury notes and laVment of the interest thereon. This act prodded for the issuing of slock for an amount lot exceeding $21,000,000, at a rate of inter?st "not exceeding six per centum per annum, md to be reimbursed within a period not l>eond 20 years and not less than 10years." It ras the policy of the Department to negotiate his loan for such amounts ami at such times s would place tho money in the treasury to ncet these treasury notes as they should fall lue. To have, negotiated the whole amount hereof, or any portion in advance of the notes ailing due, woidd have subjected the Govcrnnent to the unnecessary payment of interest luring the time the money would have remain! 1 iti the* vaults of the treasury uncalled for.? flu re was no power in the Department to rail n the treasury notes until they hcraine due. Cfti'les, the withdrawal of such an amount of pecic from the public would have hern atterul* >d with the most injurious clients upon the inancial operations of the country. For thrse easons, no negotiation of any portion of the oar. was attempted until the Stliday of Sepember, 1800, when proposals were invited for en millions of the loan, which was ample to neet all the treasury notes that would fa!! due >efore January I, 1801. Tjju rate of interest was fixed at the percentile per annum, under the conviction that the oan-eould he lendily negotiated at that rate, or at that time the live per cent, stock of the United States was selling in the market at a iremium of three per cent. The result reilizcd this just expectation, and the whole imount offered was taken either at par or a imali premium. Before, however, the time had irrivod for payment on the part of the bidders, .he financial crisis, to which I have already reerred, came. Some of the bidders promptly minplied with their proposals, and others were villiug to do so, if required by the Department, hough it would he at a considerable sacrifice. Under these circumstances, an additional term >f thirty days was given to all bidders who vnuld deposit one half of the amount of their aids within the time originally prescribed.? dost of the bidders availed themselves of this ixtcnsion, and made their deposits accordingly in or belore the *22d of November, 1860. A portion, however, failed to do so, and to them ;hc additional thirty days has been offered, on mndition that they would increase their forfeit leposit of one per cent, to tjve per cent. To ;ltis proposition no response has as yet been eceived. The amount of the loan awarded to liia Wl fitfiec 1-ifliidrWc is <1 flOfl 000 The question presents itself, -.what action shall be taken into reference to the stock which nay be thus forfeited ? There is r.o power in he Department, as the lajv now stands, to meet .he case. It is recommended that. Congress should immediately authorize the Department :o dispose of this stock upon the best possible terms, holding the defaulting bidders responsible for the difference between their bids arid the amount for which the stock can now be negotiated. The necessities of the Treasury demand prompt action on litis subject. Not July are the Treasury notes past due rapidly :otning in for redemption, but, as nlready stated, those not due are being paid in for customs, thereby withdrawing from the regular jpcralions of the Government its principal icource of revenue. The particulars in regard to the negotiation )f the loan authorized by the act of June 22d, 1SC0, required to be reported to Congress by :he third section of the act, are contained in the statement marked No. -J 8. To meet the remaining outstanding treasury lotes and interest ihereon, there is yet to be icgotiated eleven millions of the stock autho ized by the act of June 22, ISii't. The statoncntjust made of the difliculties attending the jayuicnl for the stock already sold, in connec:ion with the fact that capitalists, in the pre;ent condition of the country, seem unwiliiug ,o invest in United States stock at par, renders t almost certain that this remaining eleven nillions cannot now be negotiated upon terms icccptablc t<> the Government. The condition >f tiie treasury is such that no serious delay Sin be indulged. 1 recommend, therefore, a epeal of so much of the act of June 22, I860, is authorises the issuing of this additional elevm millions of stock and that authority he given or the issuing of treasury notes to the same unount, to he negotiated at such rates as will tummand the conlidence of the country. To :reate that confidence, 1 recommend that the uiblic lands he unconditionally pledged for the iltiniflto redemption of all the treasury notes vliich it may become necessary to issue. 1 make his recommendation of substituting treasury lotes for stock the more readily from the conlonviction that there should always exist in the lepartiaent power to issue treasury notes for a iiuited amount, under the direction of the Preideiit, to meet unforeseen contingencies. It s a power which can never be abused, as the .mount realized from such source can only be ised to meet lawful demands upon the treasu- ; y. Xo Secretary of the Treasury or President could ever exercise it, except compelled to do 0 by the exigencies of the public service On he other hand it would enable the Governucnt to meet, without embarrassment, those udden revulsions to which the country is alrays liable, and which cannot always be antiipated. I have already stated that provision should ; ie made at once to relieve the Treasury from ' Ls present embarrassments, produced by the , auses referred to. To do this. Congress should j uthorize the issuing of an additional amount f f Treasury notes, not less than ten mil.ions of j ollars. With these means the department. rill be enabled to meet all lawtul demands up- j , n it for the present. The extent of the tinanial crisis through which the country is now ; assing cannot now be determined, and, until ; is better known, no policy can be reeom- j lended of a permanent character. Xo change in the revenue laws can be made j 1 time to meet these difficulties; and if it could, . ! re same causes would produce the same re- J suits undor any laws that might he passed. If Congress, however, should determine upon such a policy-?either with a view to meet existing difficulties or for the purpose of providing for the payment of any portion of the public debt, I can only refer them, for the views of the department, to my former reports ?n that subject. The attention of Congress is again called to the bill for the revision and consolidation of the revenue laws prepared by the Department and submitted at the first session of the last Congress, in compliance with a resolution r.f the House of Representatives. The importance of adopting the changes and modifications contained in this measure, cannot lie too strongly urged upon the consideration of Congress. They would facilitate the operations of tlie Department, reconcile conflicting provisions of the law, and greatly reduce the expenditure in this branch of the public service. As slated in a former report, the Department has already reduced the expense of collecting the revenue from customs, and. with the aid which the passage of this law would allbrd, still further and greater reductions could be made with benefit to the public service. In this connection, the attention of Congress is called to the condition of the revenue murine service. With the exception of the Harriet Lane, lucre are none but sail vessels employed in the service. Steam vessels are so rapidly supplanting sail vessels in the commercial business of the country, that the present sail vessels of the revenue service, however well - ' I U.u luniinr fifufe uf tliincs. are bo auajucu iu ?.???- *- - - ^ ? cou)in" almost useless for the purposes for which they are employed. 1 have before represented to Congress that this service could be transferred to the Navy Department with benclit to the public interest, and 1 entertain that opinion still. If this should not be done, the policy should at nil events be adopted of substituting, as rapidly as possible, steam for the sail vessels now used. It is due to the officers employed in this branch of the revenue service, to say, that their pay does not correspond with tiie compensation paid to officers engaged in similar and loss laborious duties. In?the bill already referred to, an increase of their pay was recommended, and, in my opinion, it should be promptly carried out, as an act of simple justice to a worthy class of public officers. In each of uiy former annual reports, i called the attention of Congress to the- provisions of the act of March 3, 1557, on the subject of deposits by the disbursing agents of the government. The impossibility of executing those provisions has been so fully discussed in those repotts that 1 deem it unnecessary at this time to do more than to refer to the subject, and repeat the recommendations of former reports. Congress should not permit a law to stand upon the statute books which cannot be executed, when, by a few simple mod iti cat ions, the objects of the law can he fully effected, ami the public interest protected against lite apprehended evil. The report of the Director of the Mint is herewith transmitted, marked No. ft. It appears that the amount of bullion received at the several mini establishments during the fiscal year ending June :ilt, IStiti, was *22,07?, 1'J2 21 in gold, and *8,152,437 15 in silver; and that the coinage during the same period was *28,447,28:; in gold, and *2,250,030 2(5 in silver, together with $042,000 in cents. The report of the acting Engineer-in charge of the Bureau of Construction is herewith submitted. It furnishes full ditails of the progress of the public buildings in course of construction. The policy adopted by the Department in reference to works of this character, and presented in former reports to Congress, has been continued during the past year. .My views in reference to these works, and especially on the subject of marine hospitals, have been so often urged upon Congress that it is deemed unnecessary to do more at this t ime than to say that each year's observation and experience confirm and strengthen former convictions. Accompanying the report of this officer will be found the action of the Department under the aet of March 3, 1857, authoi i '.ing the analysis of iron ores. It will be lound to be an instructive do...i.i r.? material interest .if nor "" * t - country. On the 1 Gtli of Febriary, IS*?7, Congress passed a joint resolution authorizing the "Secretary of the Treasury tc cause inquiry to be made, by two competent commissioners, into processes and means claimed to have been discovered by .J. T. Barclay ror preventing abrasion, counterfeiting and deterioration of the coins of the United State.," Under the authority of this law, Professor Henry Vcthake and R. E. Rogers were appointed to act as such commissioners. On the -2d June, 1S60, an additional appropriation o( $5,000 was made to carry out the joint resflution of 1857. I herewith communicate ths report of these commissioners and the acton of the department on the subject, it tlu objects which Dr. Barclay proposes to accomplish can be effected, it is difficult to estimate tin advantage which would be derived by the Gorernment and the public from his discovery. The experiments already made have been attended with such results as to induce the opinion that it will prove entirely successful. .Such i- the strong conviction of my own mind to tlat effect that J do not hesitate to recommend a sufficient appropriation be made to test fully the practicability of the measure, and at the same time to compensate Dr. Barclay liberally ?>r his discovery. There should be placed under the control of the Secretary of the Treasury fur this purpose the sum of $100,000. Congress at its last session authorized the appoinment of delegates to represent this government in the International Statistical Congress, which met in London, la July last. I had on two occasions called the attention of Congress to the importance of establishing uniform standards of weights and measures, a uniform unit of currency, and a uniform mode of preparing and keeping commercial statistics among the commercial countries of the world. It was with a view to these results that the authority was given for the appoinment of delegates to this International Congress. Its action was, therefore, looked to with much interest, and tlic most beneficial results were anticinated from it. 1 regret to say that these expectations were all disappointed, and from a cause which it is not the province of this report to discuss. The Hon. A. If. Longstreet, of South Carolina, was the only delegate from the United Suites who took his seat in the Congress. I herewith submit his report, showing the reason of his withdrawal therefrom on the first day of its session. It is only necessary to say that the withdrawal of Judge Longstreet from the Cougress, and his rcfu.-al to return to its deliberations, received the entire approval of this Government. The report of the Superintendent of the Coast Survey, presenting the operations of his service for the last fiscal year, will he submitted to Congress at an early day. The accompanying reports from the various bureaus of the Department, marked from A to L, contain a detailed statement of their operations during the last fiscal year. The general operations of the Treasury Department, since my last annual report, have been of the most satisfactory character. The country had gradually recovered from the revulsion of 1357, and its healthy and prosperous condition was felt in the relief thereby afforded to the public finances. Until within a short period, I had confidently expected to present to Congress at its present session a gratifying statement of the financial condition of the gov eminent. A ditlerent result, however, has been brought about hy causes which could not he foreseen, and, if foreseen, could not have been averted by any action of the Department. All which is respectfully submitted.

Mr. Cameron moved that it be made the or- J dc-r of the day for next Monday. Adopted, i Mr. Latham presented the credentials of Ed- j i ward D. Baker of Oregon. Mr. Hale moved to reconsider the vote to mint the President's message. He said if he understood the message, it lirst showed that South Carolina has just cause to secede, and secondly, that she has no right to secede. He did think that the President should have pointed out to Congress some rule for the guidance of Congress, lie had failed to look the thing iu the lace. He iuu-1 look to the ballot-box or war for the termination of the difficulties. South Carolina asks no counsel. Site considers disunion a settled question, and is arming herself. The voice of the majority, as announced at the ballot-box would not be submitted to. The Northern States were said to be the aggressors. Gentlemen on the other side would listen to the aspersions of their fellow-citizens rather than own their convictions. We nrc trying an experiment. Our Republic j has not outlived the soldiers who fought her battles and won her victories. We have obtained what we have hy great effort, at the price, nut of revolution, but patriotism; but comparing with a contest reaching far back in English history, we are coining to the culminating point. The civil war of England was insiglicaut to our conflicts. I hope we shail settle things peaceably, but if we cannot, we must look the danger straight in the face. The South refuses to submit to the coming Administration. Mr. Brown, of Miss.?If you go to the right we will go to the left, and vie? wrsn. Mr. Iverson.?The States withdrawing disclaim further allegiance. We intend to go out of the Union before the -*th of March. Five States will go out. Arkansas and Louisiana will call u Convention pretty soon. The Black Republicans intend to use their power to put j down slavery, and our policy is to get out of the Union while we have strength. Nothing under Heaven can prevent it. Talk about the repeal of the personal liberty bills?that will not prevent it. We don't fear them much, but we most dread mob laws. We intend to go out, "peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must." : The next twelve months would find a Southern confederacy fully established, and, iu my opiu- < ion, the most prosperous and powerful ever seen. We don't apprehend war, but if the North attempt to coerce, it will conic! If the Senator from New Hampshire wants it, we will give it to liim. We are prepared to 1 fight for our liberties, rights and honor. Weare not a feeble race of Mexicans that can be easily overcome. I believe we will have a uni- : ted people, and agree harmoniously. I hope the North will see that it is the best policy to let us go, and make treaties of commerce with us rather than attempt to coerce us. We will j give them all possible advantages, and both of us will be able to live in the exercise of great- ' er friendship. There is now an enmity 1 between the Northern and Southern people I deeper than hell! No one on the other side comes here to exchange courtesies, neither do I we go there. We are enemies.

As long as we are in alliance, threats are of no s avail. Mr. Wigfall said i?> man can deny that the constitutional compact between the States is that each State shall act for itself anil on its own responsibility. He compared the violation a of the laws bv the States to a foreign power breaking its treaties with us. A-message from the House was received, informing the Senate that it had passed the hili o to secure homesteads to actual settlers ott the public domain. Mr. Wigfall continued?If violence is offered to the Slates of the South, the people will be called together to declare whether they desire to remain in the Union. If they believe that J they will live more liappv and prosperous uti- Jj dor another government, they will a>sert that t by forming a constitution. The more 1 read the President's message, the less I comprehend it. . J I consider that the President believes that it is impossible to maintain the organization of the federal courts in South Carolina, or enforce c the decisions uf the judicial tribunals; but, whether the State secede or not, he lias power to collect customs there, and has power for holding possession of the forts. I intend introducing, at an early day, a resolution, to ascertain whether an order has gone from the 1 War Department in reference to the matter. ? 1 believe tho President will precipitate the very t measure he seems intending to avoid.

Gentlemen :?I have read in the Enquirer i to-day, the proceedings of a public meetin held on the first day of our Superior Court and feel constrained to say, that unless 1 hav totally misconceived and misunderstood th feelings of the people of the county on th subject of slavery, those proceedings fall ver far short of expressing their views on the sub ject. The preamble is a hmg dissertation, ver much like a wormed fence, with as many corner it,n VnHlmrn as on the Southern side. Tlie style is well enough, but the -cntimout :ire t:une and submissive, and are calculated I mislead the public as to the reeling of the pec pie of the country; and the resolutions bein the corollary of the preamble, arc pointless am unprofitable. Indeed, Mr. Lincoln might tak them as evidences of conservatism in his sense The people of this county want their con stitutional rights, and now the issue is pre sented.-wil! he satisfied with nothing short They demand that slavery shall be recognize* as resting on the same footing as other property and they deeply sympathize with the Suuthen States in their movements to protect their slav property; and, come what may, they will nev er consent to the coercion of a sovereign Stab by the armed power <? tlie General Govern mcnt. They emphatically disown tin.- sentiment re ccntly uttered in a public meeting in an ad joining county, that "a Union with Soutl Carolina and the other cotton States would bi but little better than a Union with the North in either ease we have every tiling to lose. am. nothing to gain." With a view of obtaining a fuii expression of the opinions of the count)' on these subjects, it is suggested that the people hold another puhlic meeting at their approaching Docomber Court. X.
