PRICE FIVE CENTS. PINEAPPLE DEMONSTRATIO AT THE ALASKA-YUKON FAIR Loyd Childs Working on the Greatest Pine apple and Hawaiian Exhibit Ever Planned Hawaiian Girls. J Loyd Childs is planning a pineapple exhibit at the Alaska-Yukon Exposition which it is believed will be one of the features of the fair. The plan is to serve Hawaiian pineapples sliced, and in an attractive way at the Hawaiian building, making a charge of ten cents a dish. It is a part of the plan to take a Hawaiian glee club of at least seven members, and seven Attractive looking Hawaiian women to serve the pineapples. It is believed that the plan can be made to largely pay for itself and at the same time attract attention to Hawaii as few other things would. Ordinarily, such a concession could only be secured by the payment oi twenty-five per cent, of the receipts to the exposition. But Hawaii has secured the privilege of carrying out such a plan without paying a royalty for the con cession, so that it is likely to be more nearly a self-supporting proposition than it otherwise would be. 1 The pineapples to be served will be canned pineapples, except as the ripen ing fruit from the exhibit of green pines are used. It is estimated that served in this way the returns would be forty-five cents a can. The arrangements for serving will be attractive. The furniture will be koa, and lauhala mats will be used on the floor, the intention being that at the end of the fair everything cf this sort shall be sold. Mr. Childs is now working , with the pineapple men making the arrange- . xaents by which this exhibit can be carried out. PUBLIC LIDS ID PLAGUE MONEY Governor Frear at Work These Important Subjects. on j SHIPPERS MID THE H-H. LINE San Francisco Opinion on the Sudden Increase of Charges. SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 3. Gossip was rife yesterday concerning the forces back of the proposal of the American-Hawaiian Steamship Com pany to increase eastbound rates affect ing California commodities, the consen sus of opinion being that the advance is no less than a piece of strategy, and that the great Tailroad interests have crushed the precious independence of the big ocean freight line. The suggestion that the Harriman in terests have purchased the control, or any part of the steamship company is lacking official confirmation, but it is believed in most business circles that the proposed increase of rates is the direct outgrowth of a traffic agreement dictated by the transcontinental rail roads. By what means the Harriman inter ests have succeeded in perfecting the suspected traffic arrangement, under -which the American-Hawaiian company will follow whatever advances of rates are made by the transcontinental rail roads, is something which none can out business circles yesterday. And business men defy the steamship line io oner a single logical reason ior a voluntary advance of rates when the maintenance of existing rates appar ently is to its best interests. ' Numerous inquiries at business houses failed to establish that the steamship company had notified its patrons of the proposed increase. For fully a month some have awaited such advices, as it naa been expected that .increases would be made of rates on specific com modities. - Increases Indicated. Two weeks ago it was learned that the rate on leather would be slightly increased. It was learned also that canned fruits would be required to bear an advance of about 5 cents a hundred pounds. All efforts to estab lish officially the character and extent of the advances were met with the statement that the contemplated tar iffs had not been received from New York. There was no intimation by the of ficers of the steamship company that a horizontal increase of rates was con templated, but, to the contrary, the impression was created that one or two changes would be made in order to place traffic on a strictly profitable basis. It was explained that the American-Hawaiian Company had not been in business for a great period of time and, consequently, adjustments of rates were constantly being made. Shippers were assured that they would be advised of contemplated increases of the rates on their specific commod ities. In view of these statements and the apparently considerate attitude of the steamship company, no one imagined that a horizontal increase of rates would be made, corresponding to what ever advances were decided upon by the transcontinental railroads. Naturally, the announcement in yes teTday s Chronicle of a general in suscrest. let alone explain. liut it is crease of rates to meet the threatened Lnnwlorlm that an tariffs of the transcontinental lines officer of the Southern Pacific Company "rf ' Governor Frear seems to be at work in Washington in an effort either to have the Territory reimbursed for some of its expenditures in protecting 1 the Pacific Coast from plague and , other diseases from the Orient, or else to have it relieved from the bur den of such expenditures in the fu ture.

AMERICAN NAVY WW HAS .FEW FORMBS A local naval officer, in going over the statistics of the American navy, has found some interesting data on the na tionality of the bluejackets and ma rines. A book on naval matters writ ten by a French officer, which he has been reading, throws a striking compar ative statement in contrast with the present figures. The French writer, in drawn for the purpose of permitting referring to the beginning of the Span- ithe Legislature to amend our public jsh -j. in 1898, quotes the Spanish ,anu lawS. xuy W ur v Minister of Marine as saying, in a com munication to Admiral Cervera, that he had nothing to fear from the American fleet as its sailors were largely mer cenaries and drafted from all nations of the globe, intimating that the na- ernor Frear on his way to the Coast No copies of the drafts in their final shape have been received here, so far as known.

WORLD DENOUNCES THE PRESIDENT WARMLY BECAUSE OF HIS ISSACE Defies the Chief Executive and Holds Him Up to Ridicule Muravieff Dead Official Totals of Presidential Vote. (Associated Press Cablegrams.) NEW YORK, December 16. The World answers Roosevelt's message ta Congress, in which the President denounces the statements of the Pulitzer news papers about crooked work on the Panama canal and threatens libel suits, In a denunciatory leader. The World defies the President and quotes his message as an assertion, for the first time by an American Chief Magistrate, of the doctrine1 of lese-majeste. It says that neither King Edward nor the Kaiser would ar rogate to himself such despotic powers. No other living man, continues the World, has libeled the United States as Roosevelt has. It has been his habit to besmirch Congress, bulldoze judges, assail the integrity of the courts and slander private citizens. . ; ; : -- . THE

But when the same thing has happened here, the Territory has been Jeft to put up the funds itself with which to make the fight. At the same time it is universally admitted that this is an outpost that is of great ser vice in protecting the Coast cities. Acting Governor Mott-Smith ex presses the belief that the Governor is i now has a total of over 39,000 men, 95 per cent, of whom are citizens of the United States. The pure native-born Americans in the navy comprise 87 per cent, of the total of 39,048 men, and the naturalized v citizens 8 per cent., making a total percentage of 95. Ihere are 11,364 petty officers. Many and auarantinable diseases. The Mer chants' Association and the Chamber of Commerce will be communicated with to furnish the information de sired.

I was a positive sensation in the busi a month ago made the statement that the Harriman railroads did dominate the steamship line, and th3t its rates would be raised. The rates will be raised, according to Allen M. Sutton, the general freight agent of the American-Hawaiian company. The rates, furthermore, will be rais ed, it is said, about the day on which the advanced tariffs of the transcon tinental lines will go into effect. And, moreover, the rates, Sutton has admitted, will correspond in most par ticulars to the railroads' 10 per cent, horizontal increase, and as far as is now known, they will affect only Cali fornia and only California products. Significance in Admissions. These startling admissions, coming as a sequence to tne reportea Doast oi a high Southern Pacific officer that the Harriman railroads had already pro vided for an increase of the rates of the American-Hawaiian Steamship com pany are alive with significance, say shippers. "There is no question but that there has Wen a traffic agreement made," pays Joseph Durney, a director of the Merchants' Exchange. "I can see the strength of the Ha riman interests in this proposed in crease of rates of the American-Hawaiian company," says Albert Frank, vice f president of the big tanning firm of S. H. Frank & Co. "Evidently the advance of rates was planned long ago and it is the purpose to exact a tax from us in one way if not in another." "Obvious'y the railroads and the steamship line have come together," says George J. Bradley, manager of the California Traffic Association. These opinions were echoed through- General Freight Agent Allen M. Sut ton, when asked by a shipper whether the report of the proposed advance was correct, replied in effect: "I did not sav what the Chronicle said said." Notwithstanding, he admitted that the increase would be made, sug eesting that westbound rates would be advanced first. He did not deny that eastbound rates would be increased, nor did he descant at length when asked whether shippers were expected to absorb the advance on commodities which have already been quoted under existing tariffs. Argument of Shippers. Shippers are ready to meet whatever iirguments may be offered by the steamship company in refutation of the ostensible traffic agreement with the transcontinental railroads. One says that according to the American-Hawaiian Company, its steamers are now carrying 75 per cent, cargoes. With the increased differential created by the advance of rail rates, argues this man, the steamers might easily carry full cargoes. Moreover, he says, if the steamship company would avoid making au increase of its rates, there would be no limit to the development of its business. In a year or two the enormously enlarged tonnage would require many additional steamers. "It seems absurd," said he, "to suggest that this is a voluntary ad vance of rates. Ordinarily, ideas of business would encourage the company to follow the lead of the railroads and to get all the commodities would bear. But in this instance the circumstances are entirely different. The steamers are not carrying full cargoes. That is a fact with "which every business man (Continued on Page Four.)
