n which ho wanapcaking speaking Tho library committee witscomposed composed of leading citizens elected without out political prejudice with the sole Idea that they were the best fitted men in Montclair clair to look after the interests of the readingpublic publicTho Tho public library was erected at a costmore more than twice an great as that of thochurch church and the results were used to vindicate cate Mr Grants contention that privateenterprise enterprise is superior to the best intentionsof of a public officialHero Her is a public plant said he thepublio public library in which there is no machineryno I no complicated equipment with the simplest vilest problems of construction Yet hadIt It not been for the accidental knowledgeof Iof of some of the members of the board thepublio public library would have been as InefficientIn In Interior arrangements as it is anachronistic tic from an architectural standpoint On the other hand the church next doorput put up a building almost perfect in interiorarrangements arrangements and unique in its structuralbeatity beauty This result was attained at leesthan than half the cost of the public libraryIn In spite of the denial of thoroughgoingSocialists Socialists thn ownership and operation bycities cities of traction telephone gas electriclight light and water works Is socialistic 11 thatit it substitutes collectivism for private enterprise prise The success or failure of such s cialistic methods must bo determined by acomparison to and results withsimilar comparison ns cost ad rEult8 similar service performed by private enterprise prise Such a comparison shows almostif i not quite without exception that forequally equally good service the cost is increasedby by municipal ownership As a matter offact fact the service is usually inferior in spitoof of this Increased costInferiority Inferiority of service he said is duechiefly chiefly to the collecting of municipal employees ployees for political reasons instead offor for their fitness for the work required thoshort short tenure of office of the higher officialsand and their ignorance of the details of thework work which they are expected to supervise vise find direct and the lack of the incentiveot ot personal gain from the commercialsuccess success of the undertakingAs As the political future of these higherofficials

making unwarrantable warrantable concessions to tho departmentemployees pioyeeaIn employees In this way argued the speaker boatrule rule Is perpetuated and Democratic government ment is supplanted by n bureaucracy whichbecause because of tho largo number of employeesis is well nigh impregnableTho Tho Increased taxes nnd rents resulting from this municipal ownership put at I commercial disadvantage the manu rOftu rert in cities where this form of socialism isprevalent prevalent and make necessary either 1 removal t Imo other locality or thereduction reduction of wages of their employees ployees
