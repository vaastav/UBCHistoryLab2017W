We publish in this Usfe';- tKe first annual message of Irf sitfent Lir.coln. Thl fete feour at frbich it was received by m rtfrd-efs It impossible for us to make any lengthened comment on bis recommendations at this time. . Suffice it to say that it ii an able and patriotic document, coming fully up, in our opin ion, to what was expected of the President by the people ; in saying that the "Union must and shall be preserved at all hazards : and to preserve it, if Slavery must go, let it go. Congress, if we may judge by what has already transpired will not be slow in taking fcfjfi at hii word ; and whatever legis lation they may make, in dealing this monster a blow that will send it along way towards its death, we believe, and the Message is a warrant for what we say, that in the deliberate action of the Representatives of the Feopie,, the President, will gladly acquiesce:- We ask for the Message a careful perusal, believing that every one, who prefers the preservation of the Union- and1 the tndTcalfon of tne Constitution to all else, must be gratified by the position the President has assumed. ' ' Gen. Price has just issued a proclamation to the people of Missouri, calling for 50,000 men. The telegraph also informs us that Missouri has been formally admitted into the Southern Confederacy. Price's proclamation ays that only about 5,000 persons, "boys and small property holders" fcave rallied to the standard of rebellion. Judging from this rallying cry Price's army must be badly " cared for." It has no rations for new recruits for it tells them to bring their rations ; it bas no arms, for it tells them to bring their arms; no forage, for it forbids the bringing of horses. It is plain that this army can not long hold together. The . frosts of winter will scatter it. Menphis can no longer be saved in Jfissouri, as the press of that city have boasted it has been, and vernal blooms hail see Missouri resurreeted from the rebellion a free State, all but in name. Let Gen. Price invoke his 50,000 men. He Will find it like calling "spirits from the . vasty deep. lie will never pay them in the property of Northern men, and that six feet of Missouri soil awaits him cheerfully. Oa!r two States Leit.

You will not be surprised to learn that in the peculiar exigencies of the times our Intercourse with foreign nations has been attended with profound solici tude, chiefly turning npon our own do mestic affairs. A disloyal portion of the American people have, during the whole year, been engaged, in an at temp to divide aud destroy the Union. A nation which endures faction' and domestic divisions, is exposed to disre spect abroad, and' one party or both is sure, soone'r or later, to invoke foreign ihrervention . Nations thu tempted to interfere are not always able to resist the counsels of seeming expediency and" ungenerous ambition, although measures adopted under such influ ences seldom fail to be unfortunate and injurious to those adopting them. The disloyal citizens of the United States who have offered the ruin of our coun try in reward for the aid and comfort which they have invoked abroad, have received less patronage and encourage ment than they probably expected. If it were just to suppose, as the insur gents have seemed to assume, that for eign nations in this case, disregarding all moral, social and treaty obligations, would act solely and selfishly for the most speedy restoration of commerce, including specially the acquisition of cotton, those nations -appear as yet not to have seen their way to their ob ject more directly or clearly through tne destruction than through the pres ervation of tho Union. If we could dare to believe that foreign nations are actuated by no higher principle than this, I am quite snre a second argu ment could be made to show them that they conld reach their aim more reaJD ly and easily by aiding to crush this rebellion than by giving encouragement to-the principal lever relied on by the exciting of foreign nations to hostility against us, as already intimated, in the embarrassment . of commerce. -Those nations, however, not improbably saw from tho first that it was ihe Union which made as well our foreign as our domestic commerce. Thev can scarce ly fail to perceive that the effort for disunion produces the existing difficul ty, and that one strong nation promis es more durable peace and more ex tensive, valuable and reliable com merce than can the same nation broken into hostile fragments. It is not my purpose to review our discussions with foreign States, because whatever might be their wishes or dis positions, the integrity of our country and the stability of our Government, mainly depends not upon them, but upon the loyalty, patriotism, virtue and intelligence of the American people. The correspondence itself, with the nsual reservations, is herewith submit ted. I venture to hope it will appear, that we have practiced prudence and liberality towards foreign powers, averting causes of irritation, and with firmness maintaining our own rights and honor. Since, however, it is ap parent that here, as in every other State, foreign dangers necessarily at tend domestic difficulties, I recommend that adequate and ample measures bo adopted for maintaining the public de fences on every side. While under this general recommendation, provision for defending our coast line readily oc curs to the mind, I also, in the same connection, ask the attention of Con gress to our great lakes and rivers. It is believed that some fortifications and depots of arms and munitions with harbor and navigation improvements at well selected points upon these, would be of great importance to the national defence and preservation. I ask attention to the views of the Secre tary of. War expressed in his report upon the same general subject, i I deem it of importance that the loy al regions of East Tennessee and Wes tern North Carolina should be connec ted with Kentucky and other faithful parts of the Union, by railroad, I there tore recommend, as a military measure, that Congress provide for the construc tion of sueh a road as speedily as pos sible. Kentucky will no doubt co-op- ercte, and through her legislature make . -j; i .i i- the mo; luaicious selection oi me line. The Northern terminus must connect with some existing "raiijrpad, and wheth er the route shall be from Lexington or Nteholasville, to Cumberland Gap, or from Lebanon to the Tennossee line, in the direction of Knoxville or some still different line, can easily-be deter mined. Kentucky and the general Government co-operating:, the work can be completed in a very short time. and when done it will be not only of vast present usefulness, but also an available permanent improvement, worth its cost in all the future. Some treaties, designed chiefly for the interests of commerce, and having no grave political importance, have been negotiated and will be submitted to the Senate for their consideration. Although we have failed to induce some of the commercial powers to adopt a desirable melioration for the vigor of maritime war, we have far re moved all the obstacles from the way of their humane reform, except such ai are merely of temporary and acciden tal occurrence. I invite your attention. to the corres pondence between Her Bntanic Majes ty's Minister accredited : to this Gov ernment, and the Secretary of State, , iauve io the detention of the British shibl Perthshire, in Jane J . hv the Unitea States steamer Massachusetts, for a supposed breach of the blockade. As this detection was occasion by an obvious misaprehension of tho facts, and as justice requires that we should commit no belligerent act not founded in strict right as sanctioned by public law, I recommend that an appropria tion be made to satisfy the reasonable demand of the owners of the vessel for her detention. I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor in his annual message to Congress, in December last, in regard to the disposition of the surplus whieh the. claims of American citizens against China, pursuant to the awards of the Commissioners, under the act rf th third of March, 1859. ; If, however, it should not be deemed advisable to car ry that recommendation into effect, t would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal,- over the sur plus reterrea to, in good-securities, with a viow to tho satisfaction of such-oilier just claim of our citizens against China, as are not unlikely to- arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that Empire. ( I r ' . ; ; By fhie'jtction of the 5th of August last Congress authorized the President to instruct the commanders of suitable vessels to defend themf!viii' aciinit. and to capture pirates. This authority has. been: exerniaitd in ' n sinrrlA ' in stance . Only. : For the more effectual protection of our extensive and valua ble commerce in the Eastern seas es pecially, it seems to me that ft would also be advisable to anthorize the com manders of sailing vessels to recapture any prizes which pirates may make of United States vessels and their cargoes, aud the consular Courts established by laws in Eastern countries to adjudicate the cases in the event that this should not be objected to by the local author ities. If any good reason exists why we should persevere "longer in withholding our recognition of the Independence and Sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regaru io mem, wiuiout me appro bation of Congress, I submit for your consideration the expediency of an ap propriation for. maintaining a (Jharqe cV Affairs near each of those States. It does not admit of doubt that im poitant commercial advantages might be seenred by favorable treaties with them. - The operations of the Treasury du ring the period which .has elapsed since your adjournment, have been conduct ed with signal success. The patriotism of the people has placed at the dispos al ot the vjroverninent the large means demanded by the public exigencies. Much of the national loan has. been taken by citizens of the industrial classes, whose confidence in their coun try's faith, and zeal for their country's deliverance from its present peril, have induced them to contribute to the sup port of the Government to the whole of their limited acquisitions. This fact imposes peculiar obligations to econo my in disbursment aud energy in ac tion, the revenue, from all sources, in cluding loans for the financial year end ing on the 30th of June, 1860, was $80,- 835,900.27 and the expenditures for tho same period, including payment on ac count of the public debt, were $84, 578,034.34; having a balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July of $2,357, 065.80 for the first quarter of the finan cial year ending 30th September, 1861. The receipts from all sources, includ ing the balance from July 1st, were $102,532,509.27 and the expenses $93, 239,733.09 leaving a balance on the 1st of October 1861 of 84,292,776.18. Es timates for the remaining three quarters of the year, and for the financial year Of 1863, together with his views of the ways and means for meeting the de mands contemplated by them,' will be submitted to Congress by the Secre tary of the Treasury. It is gratifying to know that the expenses made neces sary by the Rebellion are not beyond the resources of the loyal people, and to believe that the same patriotism which has thus far sustained the gov ernment will continue to sustain it till peace and Union again bless the land. I respectfully refer to the report of the Secretary of War, for information respecting the numeracle strength of the army, and for recommendations having in viow an increase of its effi ciency and the well-being of the vari ous branches of the service entrusted to -his care. It is gratifying to know that the patriotism of the people is equal tojthe occasion and that the num ber of troops tendered, greatly exceeds the force which Congress authorized me to call into the field. I refer with pleasure to those portions of his report which make allusion to the creditable degree of discipline already attained by our troops, and to the excellent san itary condition of the entire army. The recommendation by the Secre tary for an organization of the military upon a uniform basis, is a subject of vital importance to the future safety of tne country, ana is commenaea io me serious attention of Congress. A large audition to the regular army, in con nection with the defection that has so considerably diminished the number of its officers, gives peculiar importance to his recommendation for increasing the corps of Cadets, to the greatest ca pacity of the Military Academy. By mere omission, I presume, Con gress has failed to provide chaplains for the hospitals occupied by volun teers. This subject was brought to ray notice, and I. was induced to draw up the form of a letter, one copy of which was properly addressed to each of the persons, and at the dates respectively named and stated in a schedule, con taining also the form of the letter, marked "A," and herewith transmit ted. These gentlemen, I understand en tered upon the duties designated at the times respectfully slated in the schedule, and have labored faithfully therein ever since ; I therefore recommend that they be compensated at the same rale as Chaplains in the army. I fur ther suggest that general provision be made for Chaplains to serve at hospi tals as well as with regiments. The report of the Secretary of the Navy presents in detail the operations of that branch of the service, and the activity and energy which have char acterized its administration, and the re sults of measures to increase its effi ciency and power. Such have been the additions by construction and pur chase that it may almost be said a navv has been created and brought into ser vice sinee our difficulties commenced. Besides blockading our extensive coast, squadrons larger than erer before as sembled under our flag have been put afloat and performed deeds which have increased our naval renown. I would invite special attention to the rccora- mendationTof. the Secretary of the Navy for" a more perfect organization of the JVavy by introducing additional grades' in the service. - The present or ganisation is defective and unsatisfac tory and the suesestions submitted bv the Department will, it is believed, if aaopteoyobviate the difnculties alluded to, promote harmony and increase the efficiency of Vne Navy. There are three vacancies on the beuch of the Supreme Court, two by the decease of Justice Daniel and Mo- Lean, and one1 by the resignation of Justice , Uampbell. 1 have so far tor borne making nominations to fill these vacancies, for reasons which I will now state, Two of the outgoing Judges resided within the States now overrun by revolt, so that if successors were appointed in the same localities, they could not serve upon their circuits, and many of the most competent men here probably would not take the personal hazard of accepting to serve even here upon the Supreme Bench.: I have beoj unwilling to throw all the appointments northward, thus disabling myself from doing justice to the South on the return of peace, although I may remark that to transfer to the North one which has heretofore been in the South, would not, with reference to territory and population be unjust. During the long and brilliant judicial career . of Judge McLean, his circuit grew into an em pire altogether too large for any one Judge to give the Courts therein more than a nominal attendance, rising in population from 1,470,000 in 1831 to 6,151,405 in 1861. Besides this, the country has generally outgrown our present judicial system. If uniformity was at all intended, the system requires that all the States shall be accommo dated with Circuit Courts, attended by Supreme Judges, while in fact Wiscon sin, Minnesota, Iowa, Kansas? Florida, Texas, California and Oregon have never had any such courts. Nor can this be well remedied without a change of the system, because the adding of of Justices to the Supreme Court enough for the accommodation of all parts of the country with Circuit Courts, would create a Court altogether too dangerous for a judicial body of any sort, and the evil of it be one that will increase as new States come into the Union. Circuit Courts are useful or they are not useful. If useful, no State should be denied them ; if not useful, no State should have them. Let them be provided for all or abol ished as to all. Three modifications occur to me here, which I think would be an improvement upon our present system. Let the Supreme Court be of convenient number in every event ; then, first, let the whole country be di vided into Circuits of convenient size, the Supremo Judges to serve in a num ber of them corresponding to their own number, and independent Circuit Judges be provided for all the rest ; or, secondly, the Supreme Judges bo re lieved from Circuit duties and Circuit Judges bo provided for all the Courts : or, thirdly, dispense with Circuit Courts altogether, having the. judicial function wholly to the District Courts and an independent Supreme Court. I respectfully recommend to the con sideration of Congress the present con dition of the statute laws, with the hope that Congress will be able to find an easy remedy for the many incon veniencies and evils which constantly embarrass those engaged in the practi cal administration of them. Since the organization of the Government, Con gress has enacted some 5,000 acts and joint resolutions, which till more than 6,000 closely printed pages, and are scattered through many volumes Many of these acts have been drawn in haste and without sufficient caution, so that their provisions are often obscure in themselves or in conflict with each oth er, and at least so doubtful as to render it very difficult for even the best in formed persons to ascertain precisely what the statute law really is. It seems to me very important that the statute laws should be made as plain and in telligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may be con sistent with the fullness and precision of the will of the Legislature, and the prespicuity of its Iauguage. These well done, would, I think, greatly facil itate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and a more intelligi ble form the laws which so deeply con cern their interest and their duties. I am informed by some whose opinions I respect, that all the acts of Congress now in force, and of a permanent and general nature, might be revised and re-written so as to be embraced in one volume, or at least two volumes, of or dinary and convenient size, and I res pectfully recommend to Congress to consider the subject, and if any sug gestion be approved,' to devise such a plan as to their wisdom sliall seem most proper for the attainment of the end proposed. One of the unfavorable consequen ces of the present insurrection, is the entire suppression in many places of all ordinary means of administering civil justice to the officers, and in the forms of existing law. This is the case in whole or in part in all the insurgent States ; and as our armies advance npon and take possession of parts of these States, the practical evil becomes more apparent.. There are no courts or officers to whom the citizens of oth er States may apply for the enforce ment of their lawful claims against citi zens of the insurgent States, and there is a vast amount of debt, constituting such claims. Some have estimated it as high as 2,00,000,000 dollars, due in larjze part'from insurgents in open re bellion to loyal citizens, who are even now making great sacrifices in tho dis charge of their patriotic duty to sup port the Government. Under these circumstances I have been urgently so licited to establish by military power, courts to administer summary justice in such cases. I have thus far declined to do it, not because I had any doubt that the end proposed the collection of debt was just and right in itself, but because I have been unwilling to co beyond tho pressure of necessity in the unusual exercise - of power. But the . powers of Congress, I suppose, are equal to the anomalous occasion, and therefore I refer the whole matter to Congress with the hopo that a plan may be devised for the administration of justice in all parts of the insurgent States and Territories as may be under the'1- control of this Government, whether bv a. voluntary retarn to alle giance and order, or - by the power of our arms; this, however, not to be a permanent institution, but a temporary snbstttote, and to cease as soon as the ordinary courts can be re-established in peace. "" It is important that some more con venient means should be provided, if possible, for the adjustment of claims against the Government, especially in view of their increased number by reason of the war.. It is as much the duty of the Government to render prompt justice against itself in favor of citizens, as it is to administer the same between private individuals. The investigation and adjudication of all claims in their nature belong to the Judicial Department; besides, it is ap parent that the attention of Congress will be more than usually engaged for some time to come with great national questions. .It was intended by tho or ganization of the Court of Claims mainly to remove this branch of busi ness from the halls of-Congress. But while the Court has proved to be an effective and valuable means of inves tigation, it, in a great degree, fails to effect the object of its creation for want of power to make its judgments final. Fully aware of the delicacy, not to say the danger, of the subject, I commend to your careful consideration whether this power of making judg ments final may not be properly given to the Courtsf reserving the right of appear on questions of law to the Su preme Court, with such other provis ions as experience may have shown to be necessary. I ask attention to the report of the Post Master-General, the following be ing a summary statement of the condi tion of the Department: The revenue from all sources during tho fiscal' year ending the 30th of June, 1861, includ ing the annual permanent appropria tion of 7,000,000 for the transportation of free mail matter, was $9,049,296.40; being about two percent, less than the revenue of 1860. The expenditures were $13,606,609.11, showing a de crease of more than eight per cent., as compared with those of the previous year, and leaving an excess of expen ditures over the revenue for the last fiscal year, of over 4,557,501.61. The gross revenue for the year ending June 30, 1862, is estimated at an increase of four per cent., on that of 1861, making $8,683,000, to which should be added the earnings of the Department for carrying free matter, viz., $700,000 making $9,383,000. The total expen ditures for 1862 are estimated at $12. 528,000 leaving and estimated deficien cy of $2,345,000 to be supplied from the Treasury in addition to the present appropriation. The present insurrection shows, I think, that the exlenliou of this Dis trict across the Potomac river at the time of establishing the capitol here, was eminently wise, and consequently, that the relinquishment of that portion of it which lies in the Slate of Virgin ia, was unwise and dangerous. I sub mit for your consideration the expedi ency of retaining that part of the Dis trict, and the restoration of the origin al boundaries thereof, through negotia tions with the State of Virginia. The report of the Secretary of the Interior, with the accompanying docu ments, exhibit the condition of the several branches of tho public business pertaining to that Department. The depressing influence of the insurrec tion have been especially felt in the operations of the Patent and General Land Offices. The cash receipts from the sales of public lands during the last year have exceeded the expences of our land systf in only about $200,000. The sales have entirely suspended in the Southern States, while the interrup tions to the business of the country and the diversion of large numbers of men from labor to military service, has obstructedjsettlements in the new States and Territories of the Northwest. The receipts of the Patent Office have de clined in nine months about $100,000, rendering a large reduction of the force employed necessary to make it self-sustaining. The demands upon the Pen sion Office will be largely increased by the insurrection.-. The numerous appli cations for pensions based upon the casualties of the existing war have al ready been made. There is reason to believe that many who are now upon the pension roll and in receipt of the bounty of the Government,-are in the ranks of the insurgent army, or giving them aid and comfort. The Secretary of tho Interior has directed the suspen sion of the payment of the pensions of such persons upon proof of their disloy alty. 1 recommend that Congress au thorize that officer to cause the names of such persons to be stricken from the pensionrolls. Tho relations of the Government with the Indian tribes have been lately disturbed by the insurrection, especial ly in the Northern Superintendency, and in that of New Mexico. : The In dian country south of Kansas is in pos session of insurgents from Texas-and Arkansas. The agents of the United States, appointed since the 4lh of March for this superintendency have been unable to reach their posts, while tho most of those who were in office before that time have espoused the in surrectionary cause and assumed to ex ercise the powers of agents by virtne of commissions from the insurrection ists. It has been stated in the publio press that a portion of these Indians have been organized as a military force, and are attached to the army of the insurgents, although the Government has no official information upon the sub ject. Letters have been written to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by sev eral prominent chiefs, giving assurance of their loyalty to the United States, and expressing tho wish for. the pres ence of the Fed erar troops t'o ' protect them. It is believed that on tho repos session of the country by the Federal I forces the Indians will readily cease all : hostile demonstrations, and resume their former relations to the Govern ment. ' Agricnlture, confessedly the largest interest of the nation, has not a De partment or Bureau, but a clerkship only assigned to it in the Government, I respectfully ask Congress to consider whether something more cannot be given voluntarily with general advan tage. Annual reports exhibiting the condition of our agriculture, commerce and manufactures, would present a fund of information of great practical value to the country. While I make no suggestion as to details, I venture1 the opinion that an agrictiltnral and statistical bureau might profitably be organized. The execution of the laws for the suppression of the African slave trade, has been confined to the Department of the Interior. It is a subject of con gratulation that tho efforts which have been made for the suppression of this inhuman traffic, have recently been at tended with nnusnal success, i lve ves sels being fitted out for the slave trade, have been seized and condemned. Two masters engaged in the trade, and one person equipping the vessel as a slaver, have been convicted and subjected to the penalty of fine and imprisonment: and one captain taking up a cargo of Africans On board his vessel, has been convicted of the highest grade of of fence under onr laws, the punishment of which is death. The territories of Colorado, Dako tah and Nevada, created by the last Congress, have been organized, and civil administration been inaugurated therein under auspices especially grat ifying, when it is considered that tho Leaven of treason was found existing in some of these new countries when the Federal officers arrived there. The abundant natural 'resources of these Territories, with the security and protection attorded by orgamzea Gov ernment, will doubtless invite to-them a large immigration when pece shall restore the business of the country to its accustomed channels. I submit the resolutions of the Legislature of Colorado, which evince the patriotic spirit of the people of the Territory. So far the authority of the United States has been nphcld in a!l the Ter ritories, as it is hoped it will be in the future. I recommend their interests and defence to the enlightened and generous care of Congress. I recommend to the favorable con sideration of Congress the interests of the District ot Columbia. The insur rection lias been the cause of much suf fering and sacrifice to the inhabitants, and as they hrrve'iro representatives in Congress that body should not over look their just claims upon the Govern ment. At your late session, a ioint resolu tion was adopted authorizing the Pres ident to take measures for facilitating a proper representation of the industrial interests of the United State at the exhibition of the Industry of Alf Na tions to be holden at London in the year 1862. I regret to have been nna- b!o to give personal attention to this subject, a subject at once so interesting in itself and so extensively and intri- catelv connec-ted with the material prosperity of tho world. Through the becrctnnes of the btate and Interior, a plan or system has Wen devised and partly matured, which will be laid be fore vou. Under and by virtue of the act of Congress, entitled "An Act to Confis cate Property used for Insurrectionary Purposes," approved Aug. -6th, 1861, Igal claims of certain persons to the labor and service of certain other per sons have become forfeited. -and num bers of the latter thus liberated are al ready dependent on the United States, and must be provided for in some way; besides this, it is not impossible that some of the States will pass similar enactments for their own benefits re spectively, and by the operation of which persons of the same class will be thrown upon them for disposal. In such case, I recommend that Congress pro vide for aecpttng such persons from such States according to some mode of valuation in lieu, pro tanto, of dnect taxes, or upon some other plan to be agreed on with such btates respective ly, that such persons, on such accept ance by the General Government, he at once deemed free, and that, in any event, steps be taken for colonizing both classes, or the one first mentioned, if the other shall not be brought into existence at the same place or places, in a . climate congenial to them. It might be well to consider, loo, wheth er the freo colored people already in the United States could not, so far as individuals may desire, be included in such colonization. To carry out the plan of colonization may involve the acquiring of territory, and also an ap propriation of money beyond that to bo expended in ibo territorial acquisi tion. Having practiced the acquisition of territory for nearly fifty years, the question of Constitutional power to do so is no longer an open one wjth us. The power was first questioned by Mr. Jefferson, who, however, in the pur chase of Louisiana, yielded his scruples on the plea of great expedience. - " If it be said that the only legitimate object of acquiring Territory is to fur nish homes for white men, this meas ure effects that object, for the emigra tion of colored men leaves addition al room ior wiuie men remaining or coming here. Mr. Jefferson, however. placed the importance of procuring Louisiana, more on political and com mercial grounds, than on providing room for population. On this whole proposition, including the appropriation of money with the acquisition of Ter ritory, does not the expediency amount to absolute necessity, that without which the Government cannot be per petual. . In considering the policy io be adopted for sup preiing the insurrection, . I hare been anxious and careful tout the inevitable conflict for this purpose shall not degenerate into violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle. 1 hare, there fore, thought proper to keep the integrity of the Union prominent as the primary object of "the con test on our part, leaving all questions which are not of vital military importance to the more de liberate RCtion of the Legislature. In the exercise of my best discretion, f have adhered to a block ade of tho. ports held by the insurgents, instead of putting m force by proclamation .the. Jaw of Congress enacted at the .late sepsiou, for closing the ports. AUo, obeying" the dictates of prudence as" well as the obligations of law, instead of trans cending, I bare adhered to the act of Congress to confiscate property used for insurrectionary pur- Kaes. If new law npon the same subject shi.ll proposed, its propriety will be duly considered. Th Union must b4 prtterted, and hence all dft tille tne&fit must it employed. We shoiild not be in baste to determine what radical ind extreme measures, which may reach the loyal' as well as the disloyal, are indispe'nsable. The inaugural address at the beginning of the Administration and the Message to Congress at, the late Special Session, were boih mainly UvoUd to the domestic controversy out of which the- in surrection and consequent war have sprung. Nothing now occurs to add to or substract from the principles or general purposes stated and ex. pressed in those documeuts.' . jf ' i , . t ) The last ray of hope for preserving the "Union peaceably, expired at the assault opon Fort Sum ter, and a general review of wnat has occurred since may not be unprofitable. What was pain fully uncertain then is much better defined and more distinct now, and the progress of events is plainly in the ' right direction. The insurgents confidently claimed a strong support from north of juason ana Uixon s line, ana tne rrienas oi toe Union were not free from apprehension on this point. This, however, was soon settled definitely and on the right side. " South of the line, noble little Delawai e led off right from the first. JIary. land was made to seem against the Union ; our soldiers were assaulted, bridges were burned and railroads torn up within her limits; and we were many days at one time without the ability to bring a single regiment over ber soil to the Capital. Now her bridges and railroads are repaired and opened to the Government; she already gives seven regiments to the cause of the Union, and none to the enemy ; and her people, ' at a regular election, have sustained the Union by a large ma jority and a larger aggregate vote than they ever" before gave to any candidate or any question. A.eniucKy, too, ior lume wine id uouui, ja now decidedly and uncbangedly ranged on the side' of the Union. Missouri is comparatively, quiet, and I believe cannot again be overrun by the insur gents. These threeStates of Maryland. Kentucky and Missouri, neither of which would promise a single soldier at first, have now an aggregate of not less than 49,000 in the field for the Union, while of their citizens not more than a third in', number are among the insurgents, and they of doubtful whereabouts and existence. - After a somewhat bloody strurele of months. winter closes on the Union people of Western Virginia, leaving them masters of their own country. An insurgent force of about 1500, for months dominating the narrow peninsular region constituting the counties of Accomac end North ampton, and known as the " Eastern Shore" of Virginia, together with some contiguous parts of Maryland, have laid down their arms, and the people there bare renewed their allegiance to and accepted the protection of the flag. This leaves no armed insurrection north of the Potomac or east of the Chesapeake. Also, we have obtained a footing at each of the isolated points on the Southern coast of Hatteras, Fort Hoval. Tybee Island, (near Savannah, ) and Ship Island, and we likewise have some general accounts of popular movements in behalf or tue Union in ISortb Carolina ana lennessee. Ibese things demonstrate that the cause ef the Union is advancing steadily Southward. . Since your last adjournment Lieutenant General Scott has retired irom the head of the army. During his Ions life the nation has not been un mindful of his merit, yet on calling to mind bow faithfully, ably and brilliantly he has served the country from a time far back in our history, when few ot tue now living baa been born, ana thence forward continually, I cannot but think that we are still his debtor. I submit, therefore, for your consideration, what further mark of recognition ia due to him, and ourselves as a greateful people. ' With the retirement of Gen. Scott came the executive duty of appointingin bis stead a General- in-Chief of the army. It is a fortunate circum stance that neither in council nor country waa there, so far as 1 know, any difference of opinion as to the nroner nerson to be selected. The re-' ' tiring chief repeatedly expressed his judgment in' favor of General McClellan for the position, and in this the nation seemed to give an unanimous concurrence. The designation of Gen. McClellan is, therefore, in a considerable degree, the selec tion of the country as well as of the Executive, and hence tnere is reason to hope there will be given Jiim the confidence and cordial support thns by fair implication promised, and without which be cannot with so full efficiency serve the countrr. It bas beeu said that one bad General is better than two goood ones, and tl.e saying is true if taken to mean no more than that an army is better directed by a single mind, though inferior, then by two superior ones at variance and cross pur poses'; and the same is true in all joint operations wtrerein those eRgage4-ea- have none but a com mon end- in view, and can differ only as co tbe choice of means. In a storm at sea no one on board can wish the ship to sink, and yet not mi frequently all go down together because too many will direct, aud no single mind can be allowed to control. , It continues to developc that the'insurrection is " largely, if not exclusively, a war upon the first principle of popular government tho rights of the people. Conclusive evidence of this is found in the most grave n4 maturely considered public documents, as well as in the general tone of the7 insurgents, In these documents we find the abridgment of the existing right of suffrage and the denial to the people of all to participate in the selection of public o 31 SeT" except the legislative?" body, advocated with labored arguments to prove that large control of the Government in the people is the source of all political evil. Monarchy itself., is sometimes hinted at as a possible refuge from the power of tbe people. In my present position, I could scarcely be justified were I to omit raising a warning voice against this approach of returning despotism. It is not needed nor fitting here that a general argument should be made in favor of popular institutions, but there is one point; with lts connections, not so hackneyed as most others',' to which I ask a brief attention. It is the effort to pi nee capital on an equal footing with, if not above, -labor in the structure of Government. It is assumed that labor is available only in connection with capital ; that nobody labors uuless somebody else, owning capital, somehow by the use of it induces him to labor. This assumed, it is next considered whether it is bc6t that capital shall hire laborers and thus induce them to work by their own consent, or buy them and drive them to it without their consent. Having proceeded so far, it is naturally concluded that all laborers are either hired laborers or what we call slaves. And further, it is assumed, that whoever is once a hired laborer is fixed in that condition for life. Now, there is no such relation Let ween capital and labor, as assumed, nor is there any such thing as a freeman being fixed for life in the condition of a hired laborer. Both of these assumptions are false, and all inferences from them are groundless. Labor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor, aud never could have exist ed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and desserves much tbe higher consideration. Capital bas its rights, which are as worthy of protection as any other rights. Nor is it denied that there is, and probably always will be, a relation between labor and capital, producing mutual benefit. The error is in assuming that the whole labor of a community exists within that relation. A few men have capital, and that few avoid laber, and with their capital hire or bay a few to labor for them. A large majority belong to neither class neither work for others nor have others workiug for tbera. In most of the Southern States, a majority of the people of all colors are neither slaves nor masters; while in the Northern a large majority are neither hirers nor hired. Men with their families, wives, sons and daughters, work fur themselves on their farms, in their houses and in their shops, taking the whole product to themselves and asking no favors of capital on the one hand, nor of hired laborers or slaves on the other. It is not forgotten that a considerable number of persons mingled their own labor with capital ; that is they labor with their own hands, and also buy or hire others to labor for them; but this is only a mixed and not a distinct class. No principle 6tated is disturbed by the existence of this mixed class. Again, as has already beea said, there is not of necessity auy such thing as the freo hired laborer being fixed for that condition for life. Many independent men, everywhere in these States, a few years back in their lives, were bired laborers. The most prudent, penniless beggar ia the world labors for wages awhile, and saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself. He then labors on his own account, and at length, hires another new beginner to help him. This is the just and generous and prosperous system which opeus the way to all, gives hope to all, and the consequent energy, progress and improvement of the condition to all. No men living are more worthy to be trusted than those who toil up r on from poverty. None less iuclined to take or touch aught which they huve not earned. - Let tbem beware of surrendering a political power which they already possess, and which, if surrendered, will surely be used to close the door of advance. ment against such as they, and to fix new disabili. ties and burdens upon them till all of liberty shall be lost. . From the first taLinr of our national wntm the last are 70 years, aud we find our population at the end of the period eight times as great as it was at the beginning. The increase of those other things which men deem desirable has even been greater. W e thus Have at one view w hat the pepu- ' i" tuvipic i'pi:u uuTcmnent, tbroagn tne machinery of the States and the Union, has pro- -ducvd in a given time, and also what, if firmly . maintained, it promises for the future. There are already among us those who, if the Union be pre served, will live to see it contain 250,000,000. The struggle of to-day is not altogether for to-dav. It is for a vast future also. With afirm'reli ance on Providence, all the more firm and earnest, let us proceed in the great task which events have devolved upon ns. (Signed.)
