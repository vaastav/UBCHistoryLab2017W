Be aiso recommends tire retirement of tbe greenback*. He says tbey and no war- j . last tn tbe Constitution and tbclr issue can fee jnsftffed only by the firtea that tbe coun* j try was i? peril.

Tbe Constitution-is (be same in time ?f peace as in time of war ; and no plea can be advanced which will justify Its violation by anybody? least of all by officers sworn to -support It. Toe President is ahead of 2>is day as to tbe retirement of these green backs. His recomaaendrtfion will probably weaken his party an the West. If it bad been made two manths ago, it would have .lost Ohio to the Republicans. Tbe President recommends that the sink ing fund be provided for and maintained. He says that Utah has people enough to become a Slate if those people would b? liave themselves. He is eloquent on the .subject of securing freedom and security to voters. His hypo crisy Id tbis matter almost equals bis effront ery in continuing to prate about civil-ser vice reform. Ho refused last summer to allow a law to be repealed wbicb is tbe most objectionable one that was ever upon tbe statute-book, so far as tbe wrongs it provides for committing upon the voters j are concerned. He knows that there were numbers of Republicans elected to this very Congress wbo would never have been seen in that body if the intimidation and villainy for which that law provides bad not been practiced upon the voters. He actually devotes several pages to clvil service reform!? jo the face of the fact that he knows that assessments were made upon the Government officials right under bis nose to pay the campaign expenses of bis party in bis own State. "Fine vords? I wjnder where lie stole Vni The President parses in review the rela tions of this country to many foreign coun tries. We seem to be all right with Eng land, and in a fair way to have all ques tions between us asd Spain fettled which have grown out of tbo troubles in Cuba. He has made one treaty with the Nether lands, and has treaties 011 hand with that country and Denmark. He seems to be try ing to get China to rid his party of the Chi nese question in California, and announces that China is ready to take measures to save lis from harm from an inundation of Chi nese. As China and Japan are at logger Leads about the Lew Chaw Islands, he re commends that Uncle Sam shall help them to settle their difficulties. He then tells us about Mexico, which is not troubling our Texas* "subjects" much just now. Colombia, Chili, Venezuela, Brazil, and tbe Argentine Confederation are next touched upon. Then be jumps over to tbe Samoan -Islands, where be wants us to se cure whatever we can that will be of ad vantage to us. The Presidout says there has been an in crease of trade with nearly all Europeau and American countries. He wants laws passed for Alaska, which ought to be under a territorial government. He says that the ordinary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 3D, 1879, were $273,827,184.46. The ordinary expenditures for the same period were $266,947,0S3.53, leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $6,879,300.93. He says of the work for the improvement of the South Puss of the Mississippi river, under contract with Mr. James B. Eads, that the channel through the South Pa*s, which at the beginninc: of June, 1S75, had a depth of only 7* feet of water, had on the 8th of July, 1879, a minimum depth or 26 Jeet, having a width of not less than 200 feet, and a central depth of 30 feet. Pay ments have been made in accordance with the statute as the woik progressed, amount ing in the aggregate to 84,250,000, and fur ther payments will become due, as provided by the statute, in the event of success in maintaining the channel now secured. He makes various recommendations as to matters under control of the War, the Navy, and the Interior Departments. Also as to the Indians. He says tbat tbe receipts of the Post Oflice Department for the year ending June 30, 1873, were ?30, 041, 082.86, being ?764, 465.01 more tban tbe revenues of tbe pre ceding year. The- unjount realized from tbe sale of po4pgc-s tamps, stamped en velopes, nnd postal-cards was ?764,465.01 more than in ti?e piec':<iiog year, and $2,387.559 23 more thau in 1877. The ex penditures of tbe Department were ?33, 449,899.45, of which the sum of ?376,461.63 was paid on liabilities incurred in tbe pre ceding year. The expenditures during tbe year were $801,209.77 less tban in the pre ceding year. The President wants Congress to give him money to pay bis tools called deputy marshals and supervisors of election. We trust tbat Congress will not give him a dol lar for so unjustifiable a use. II tbe Dem ocrats appropriate money to be u^ed in bribing men to work and vote against them next fall, the members are bigger fools tban they are supposed to be. The President recommends more circuit eourts and an intermediate Court of Ap peals. In bis message the President treats tbe fol lowing subjects which we have not noticed at any length? namely, the timber in tbe Weal; the Department -of Agriculture; the topic of Education; & fire-proof building for tbe Congressional library; the Wash ington monument, and tbe affairs of tbe District joI Columbia. Whoever wishes to see what he says on these subjects is re lerrcd to the message itself. On the whole tbe message 5s just like Mr. Bates. He wrote It himstjlf evidently. There is not a sentence in tt 3Ucb as Mr. Evabts spins wit. It is a plain, practical, business-like document.- It smocks of the thrifty E. B. H*tk8.

I voogratulate Con* gresso* the successful execution of tbe re sumption act. At tbe Mote fixed and in tbe manner contemplated 4>y law United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since tbe first ot January Ia?t they bave been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in i aft business transactions public and pri vate, in all parts of the country, tbey are received and paid out as tbe equivalent of ?coin, Tbe demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States cotes bas been comparatively small, and tbe voluntary deposit of coin and bul Jion in excbant*e for notes has- been very large. Tbe excess of the precious metals' deposited or exchanged for United Stales notes over tbe amount of United Slates notes redeemed is about ?40,000,000. Tbe resumption of specie-payments bas been followed by a very great revival erf business. With a cnriency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing for eign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from tbe 1st of July last to November 15th, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since tbe resumption of spe cie-payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the Government bearing only 4 per cent, interestbave been sold at or above par sufficient in'amount to pay off all ot tbe national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by tbe process of refunding the debt since March 1, 18 77, is ?14.297,177. The bonds sold were largely in small sums, and tbe number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater tban ever before. The amount of tbe national debt which matures within less than two years is $702,121,700, or which $500,000,000 bear interest at the rate of 5 per cent., and the balance is in bonds bear ing C per cenl. interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refuuded by the issue of 4 per cent, bond?, and, by the reduction of interest which will thus be effected, about eleven millions of dollars can be annually saved to tbe Treasury. To sccure this important reduction of interest to be paid bv the United States further ie gislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session. Tbe coinage of gold by the mints of tbe United States during the last fiscal year was ?40, 986. 912. The coinage of silver dollars since the passage of the act for that purpose up to November 1, 1879, was ?45,000,850. of which ?12.700,314 have been Issued from tbe Treasurv and are now in circulation, and ?32,300,506 are still in tbe possession of tbe Government. The pendency of tbc proposition for unity of action between tbe United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of tbe world leads me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on tbe general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreiirn, wiil supplv, during the coming y<ar, its own instruc tions, which may well be awaited before at tempting further experimental measures with tbe coinage. I would, however, strongly urge upon Congress tbe import ance of authorizing tbc Secretary of tbe Treasury to suspend tbe coinage or silver dollars u pflWTtre'pi'eTehT TeimT ra ti o. Th* market value of the silver dollar being uni formly and largely less than tbe market value of tbe gold doilar, it is obviously im practicable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circula tion it will, if coined without limit, soon become tbe sole standard of viilue, and thus defeat tbe desired object, which is a cur rencv or both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar tor dolla" with the universally recognized money of the world. The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contract", is a step to be taken in our progress toward:) a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Government, and the interest and security of ttie people. It is my tirm conviction that the i>sue of lecal-tender paper-money bjsed wholly upon the authority and credit of the Gov ernment, except in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, and a violation of sound tinuncial principles. The issue of United States note? during the late civil war with the capacity of legal tender between private individuals was not au thorized except as a means of rescuing: the country from imminent peril. The circu lation of these notes us paper-money, for any protracted period of time afierthe ac complishment of this purpose, was not con templated by the framers of the law under which they were' issued. Thev anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable period con sistent with the attainment of the obj.-ct for which they were provided. The policy of the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Consti tution, has been to avoid the creation of a national debt, and when, from necessity in time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period be main tained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deemed necessary by Congress it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the price of these articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollara annually to the Treasury. The coutinued deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influ ential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws or the Unhed Slates for the prose cution and punishment of polygamy de mands the attention of every department of the Government. This Territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admis sion as a State, and the genera! interests of the nation, a? well as the welfare of the citi zens of the Territory, require its advance from the territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privileges oi a State. This important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citi zens of Utah iti very considerable number uphold a praclice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized commu nities throughout tbe-world. The lawfor the suppression of thisoffeDce was enacted with great unanimity by Con gress more than seventeen years aijo, but has remained until recently a dead letter in the Territory* of Utah because of the pecu liar difficulties attending its enforcement. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contra-; vention of the constirutionai guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The Supreme Courtof the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding us a rule of action for all who reside within the Territories. There la no'Iongerany reason for delay or hesitation in its enforcement. It should be firmly and effectively executed.' If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions j-.ii should be amended, and. . in aid of the jMjrpose in view, I recommend Um more comprehensive a od <more search : n# > met b od* for preventing""*1*' wxilt-gg-ptraisMng this crimVtl^iiW*W|fctfs & >'o?<?sateaptO secu re I obedience to tfrrinw, tbr en J lyment and in ' ^^W^^^^tfe3|Uaited j .withteld or.wt&iiraw* ttan - . .'??? u l?csejKto;si#te or J>PPpflc " gien|bf on ibj^pbU SfcapiedSfiy with;6tat* o1_ i?led to eUott to ttfopofitical dlst ^biob attended tbem all over the new and-decfctve evidence of fcb<^ . tcrest which tbe great body of citizens take lath* progress or the cou tft oiort gefferal and complete establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom W W oxer dee of the electt? franchise. WMle many topics of political concern demand great attention from oar people, both in tbe sphere of ^aonol and State authority, I find 50 reason to qualify tbe opinion I expressed in my lost annual message, that no temporary or administra tive interesi s of government, however ur gent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defence of the primary rights of citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices an J all sectiontil and State at tachments in demanding tbat all over our wide territorv tbe name and character or citizen of the United States shall mean one and tne same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect. I earn estly appeal to the intelligence and patriot ism of all good citizens of every part of the country, however much they may be di vided in opinions on other political sub jects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of tbe right of suffrage. I respectfully urge upon Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experience has shown aud which it is within its power to remedy. 1 again invoke the cotf Deration of the executive and legislative authorities of the States in this great purpose. I am fully convinced that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rights no serious obstacle will thwart or delay tbe complete pacification of tbe country, or re tard the geoeral diffusion of prosperity. In a former message I invited the atten tion of Congress to the subject of the reformation of the civil service of the Gov ernment, and expressed the intention of transmitting to Congress as earl? as prac ticable a report upon this subject by the chairman of the Civil-Service Commis sion. In view of the facls tbat, during a con siderable period, the Government 9t Great Britain has been dealing with administra tive problems and abuses, in various par ticulars analoirou3to those presented in this country, and tbat in recent years the mea sures adopted were understood to have been effective and in every respect hiubly satis factory, I thought it desirable to have fuller information upon the subject, and accord ingly requested the chairman of tbe Civil Service Commission to make a thorough in vestigation for this purpose. Tbe remit lias been an elaborate and comprehensive re port. The report sets forth the history or the partisan-spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and fall of tbe Parliamentary pa tronage, and of official interference with the freedom of elections. It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on uuder the superintendence of a single com mission, have, with great advantage, been established as eruditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordi nate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the re port, owing to tbe extent of the labor in volved in its preparation, and the omission of Consress to make auy provision either for the compensation or the expanses of the Commission, has been postponed until the present time, it is herewith transmitted to Congress. ? While the reform measures of another government are of 110 authority for us, they are entitled to influence to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom and their adaptation to our Institutions and social life may commend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning the defects and abu?.es in our civil administration remain unchanged, ex cept in so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of tbe people themsplves to co operate for their removal. Tbe grave evils and perils of a partisan -spoils system of appointment to office and of office tenure are now Generally recognized. In tbe reso lutions of tbe great parties, in the reports of departments, in tbe debates and proceed ings of Congress, in the messages of Execu tives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and tbe need of their reform has been admitted. To command the necessary support every measure of reform must be based on com mon rieht and justice, and must be compat ible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free btate. "When the people have approved a policy at a national election confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and ol the advisers who, in accordance with our polit ical institutions, should hi1 consulted in the policv which it is their duty to carry into effect, -is iudispensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people as well as illustrate its spirit in tbe performance of their official duties. Very different considerations apply to tbe greater number of those who till the subor dinate places in tbe civil service. Their re sponsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their_duty to obev the legal instructions of those upon whom that au thority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the discbarge , of tvieir functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the same, whatever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a coosequencc, it follows that tbeir ten ure of office should uot depend on the pre valence of any policy or tbe supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most use fully, quite irrespective of partisan inter ests. The same considerations that sbonld govern the tenure should also prevail in the appointment, discipline, and removal of these subordinates. Tbe authority of ap pointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may be used to aid a friend or reward i a partisan, but is a trust to he exercised In tbe public interest, und<-r all the sanctions wbicb attend the obligation to apply tbe public funds only for public purposes. Every citizen lias an equal right to the honor and protit of enteritis tbe public ser vice or bis country. Tbe only just ground of discrimination is the measure of charac ter and capacity be has to make t but service most useful to the people. Except in cases where, upon just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices and promotions are bestowed as rewards for past services, their bestowal upon any the ory which disregards personal iuerit is an act of injustice to tbe citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held. In the light of these principles, it be comes of great importance to provide just and adequate means, especially for every department and large administrative office where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not practicable for ascertain ing those qualifications to which appoint ments and removals should have reference. To lail to provide such means is not only to deny tbe opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but, of necessity, to discourage all worthy aspirants by banding over appointments and re movals to mere influence and favor itism. If it is tbe right of the worthiest claimant to gain tbe appoint ment, and th* interest of the people to be stow it upon him, it would seem dear that a wise aua just method bf ascertaining personal fitness ior office must ' be an im portant and perraanenufunctlon of every just and wise government. It- bus long since become impossible, lii Jlie great of fices, for those having the difly of nomina tion and appointment, to personally exam ine into the individual qualifications of more than a smalt proportion of those seek ing office : and, with the enlargement of the "di'vil service, that proportion musicontJnue In .the earlier years of the.

By a proper excrciw of authority, It is in tbe power or the Executive fco do much to promote such a reform. Bat it cannot be too clearly un derstood that nothing adequate can be oc complisbed without cooperation on the part of Con 2 r ess and considerate and intel ligent support among tbe people. Reforms which challenge the generally-accepted the ories of parties, and demand changes in tne methods of departments, are not the work of a day. Their permanent foundations must be laid in sound principles, ana in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes tbe errors of their ad versaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his countrv, but tbe people themselves, far more than their officers in -public sta tion, are interested in a pure, economical, and vigorous administration. By laws enacted in 1853 and 185o, and now in substance incorporated in the Re vised Statutes, tbe practice of arbitrary ap pointments to the several subordinate grades in the great Departments was con demned, and examinations, as to capacity, to be conducted by departmental boards of examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to tbe public ser vice. These statutes are a decision by Con gress that examinations of some sort, as to attainments and capacity, are essential to the well-being of tbe public service. The important questions since tbe enactment of these laws bave been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common right and merit, v/ere to control the access to tbe examinations. In practice these examinations have not always been open to worthy persons generally who might wish io be examined. Official fa voritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone were permitted to go before tbe examining boards, subjecting even tbe examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a consequence, the standard of admission fell below that which the public iuterest demanded. It was also almost Inevitable that a system which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common supervision or unirorm method of procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and in adequate tests of capacity highly detri mental to the public interests. A further and more radical change was obviously re quired. In the annual messageof December, 1870, mv predecessor declared that 4< there is no duty which so much embarrasses the Exec utive and heads of Departments as that of appointments; nor is there any such ardu ous and thankless labor imposed on senators and representatives as that of Uuding places for constituents. The present system does not secure the best men, and often not even ht men for the public places. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the Government will be hailed with approval by the whole people of the United States." Congress accordinglv passed the act ap proved March 3, 1871, ?? to regulate the civil service of thft United States and pro mote the efficiency thereof,'' giving the necessary authority to tbe Executive to in augurate a civii-service reform. Acting under this statute, which was in terpreted as intended to secure a system of just and effectual examinations under uni form supervision, a number of eminently competent persons were selected for the purpose, who entered with zeal upon tbe discbarge of their duties, prepared., with an intelligent appreciation of the require ments of tbe service, the regulations con templated, and took charge of tbe examina tions, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as the " Civil-Service Commission." Congress for two years ap propriated the money needed for tbe com pensation and lor the expense of carrying oii the work of the Commission. It appears from the report of the Com mission, submitted to tiie President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about ?'23,000 would be required to meet the annual ex penses, including salaries, involved in dis charging the duties of tbe Commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the la bors of the Commission: "If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt tbe rules can, after the expsricnce gained, be so improved and enforced as to still more materially ben elit the public service and relieve the Ex ecutive, members of Conirress, and the headsof departments from influences preju dicial to good adminii-tration. The rules as they have hitherto been enforced have re sulted beneficially, as is shown by the opin ions of the members of the Cabinet aud ttieir subordinates in tbe departments, aud in that opiniou I concur." And In the an nual message of December of the same vear similar views are expressed, and an appro priation for continuing the work of the Commission again advised. power. fgg W A rtrge find responsible^ of restoring Vhe cmfc ?ervte< purity and Efficiency rests ti dent, and It is my purpose The appropriation \v:is not made, and, as a consequence, the active work of the cooj mbsion was suspended, leaving the com mission itself still in existence. Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifica tions to be tested in any systematic manner or of securing for the public service the ad vantages of competition upon any extensive plan, I recommended in my annual message of December, 1S77, the making of an ap propriation for the resumption of the work of the Commission. In the mean time, however, competitive examinations under many embarrassments have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washing ton, and in a number of the custom-houses and post-oflices of the principal cities of the couutry, with a view to further test their effects, and in every Instance they have been found to be as salutary as they are stated to have been under the administra tion of my predecessor. I think the econo my, purity, and efficiency of the public service would lie greatly promoted by their systematic introduction wherever practi cable throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample pro vision for their general supervision, in or der to secure consistency and uniform jus tice. Reports from the Secretary of the In terior, from the Postmaster- General, from the postmaster in the city of New York, where such examinations have bren some time on trial, and also from the collector ol the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and collector* in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has, in various ways, contributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules can not fail to bo of decided benefit to the ser vice. The reports of the Government officers, io the city of New York especially, bear decided testimony to the utility of open competitive examinations in their respec tive offices, showing that "these examina tions, and the excellent qualifications of those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service, and particularly upon those aspiriug to promo tion. There has been on the part of these latter an increased interest in the work, and a desire to extenci acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has befcn raised. * * * The examinations have been attended by many citizens, who have had an opportunity to thoroughly in vesilgate the scope and character of the tests, and the method of determining Jhe re mits, and tiiQ?e YLsitora have, without ei ceptlpn, approved the. methods employed, untf Mverai of .?hem have .pytyiely aHs#ted tMrtavoratf^>.pi?Jon." . v ' ^ % /Upon such ci>ijKideratiam,,iI deem ? fltih# wit' i0"5: ; | taingtflu Bepeoiter, j 18T7, requesting Congress-to ceasary approbation forihe resumption of the WorJgP the Clvil-3ervlce Cornmit si?n, ECoaomy will be promoted by au thorizing a moderate compensation to per-i son 9 in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under tbe commission, as the Executive may direct.- ; . I am convinced that if a just and ade quate lest of merit Is enforced for admis sion tc .the public -service an A in making promotions, such abuses as removnls with out good cause and partisan and official in terference with tbe proper exercise of the appointing power will in large measure dis appear. There are other administrative abuses to which tbe attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointment', and the constant peril of re moval without cause, very naturally lead to an absorbing and mischievous political ac tivity on tbe pan of those thus appointed, which not only interferes with the due dis charge of official duty, but is incompatible with the freedom of elections. Not with out warrant, in the views of several of my predecessors in the presidential office, and directly within the law of 1871, already cited, 1 endeavored, by regulation made on the 22d day of June, 1877, to put some reasonable limits fo such abuses. It may not be easy, and it may never perhaps be necessary,* to deline with precision the proper limit of political action on the part of Federal officers. But while their right to hold and freely express their opinions cannot be questioned it is very plain that they should neither be allowed to devote to other subjects the time needed for the pro per discharge of their official duties nor to use the authority of their office to enforce their own opinions or to coerce the political action of those who bold difl'erent opinions. Reasons of justice and public policy, quite analogous to those which forbid the u>e of official power for the oppre-slon or the private citizen, impose upon the Gov ernment the du:yof protecting its officers and agents from arbitrary exactions. In whatever aspect considered, the practice of making levies for party purposes unon the salaries of officers is highly demoralizing to the public service and discreditable to the country. Though an officer should be as free as any other citizen to give his own money in aid of his opinions or his party, he should also be as free as any other citi zen to refuse to wake such gifts. If sala ries are but a fair compensation for the lime and labor oi the officer, it is gross in justice to levy a tax upon them. If they are made excessive in order that they may bear the tax, the excess is an iudireet rob bery of the public funds, I recommend, therefore, such :i revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade of official life or public employment the protection with which a great and enlightened nation should guard those who are faithful in its service. Our relations with foreign countries have continued peaceful. Willi Great Britain there arc still unset i led questions, growing out of the local lows of the maritime provinces and the ac tion of provincial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights secured by treaty to American fishermen. The United States Minister in London has been instructed lo present a demand for ?105,305 02, in view of the damages received by American citi zens at Fortune Bay on the (Jth day "f .Janu ary, 1878. The subject lias been taken into consideration by the British Government, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary pre liminary examinations, the subject of our participation in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Govenment with a view to an early and permanent s> f tiement of the whole question, which was only temporarily adjusted by the Treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the re moval of restrictions fouud injurious rothe exportation of cattle to the United King dom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and property upon the lakes, which has re sulted in important modifications of the previous regulations of the Dominion Gov ernment on the subject, in the interest of humanity and commerce. In accordanec with ttie joint resolution of the la<jc session of Congress, commis sioners were appointed to represent the United States at tiie two International Ex hibitions in Australia, one of which Is now in progress at Sydney, and tbe other to be held next year at Melbourne. A de-ire has been expressed by our merchants and man ufacturers interested in the important and I growing trade with Australia that an in creased provision should be made by Con gress for the representation of our indus tries at the Melbourne exhibition of next year, and the subject is respectfully submit ted to your favorable con-ideration. The* assent of the Government has been given to the landing on the coast of Massa chusetts of a new and independent trans Atlantic cable between France, by the way of the French island of St. Pierre and this country, subject to any future legislation of Congress on the subject. The condi tions imposed, before allowing this connec tion with our shores to be established, are such as to secure its competition with any existing or future lines of marine cable, and preclude amalgamation therewith, to provide for entire equality of rights to our Government and people with those of France in the use of the cable, and prevent any exclusive possession of the privilege as accorded by France to the disadvantage of any future cable communication between France and the United States which may be projected and accomplished by our citizens. An im portant reduction of the pre-ent rates of cable communication with Europe, felt to be too burdensome to the interests of our commerce, must necessarily flow from the establishment of this competing line. The attention of Congress was t'rawn to the propriety of some general regulation by Congress of the whole subject of trans . marine cables by my predecessor in his mes sage of December 7, 1875. and I respect fully submit to your consideration the im portance of congressional action in this matter. The questions of grave importance with Spain, growing out of the incidents of the Cuban insurrection, have been, for the most part, happily and honorably settled. It may reasonably be anticipated that the Commis sion now sitting in Washington for the de cision of yrivate cases in this connection will soon be able to bring Its labors to a conclusion. The longstanding question of Eust Flor ida claims has lately been renewed as a sub ject of correspondence, and may possiblv require congressional action for its final disposition. A treaty with the Netherlands with re spect to consular rights and privileges similar to those with other Powers has been signed and ratified, and the ratifica tions were exchanged on the 31st of July last. Negotiations for extradition treaties with the Netherlands and with Denmark ' are now in progress. Some questions with Switzerland in re gard to pauper and convict emigrants have arisen, but it is not doubted that tbey will be arranged upon a just and satisfactory basis. A question has al>o occurred with respect to an asserted claim by. Swiss mu nicipal authorities to exercise tutelage over persons and property of Swiss citizens naturalized in I his country. It is possible this may require adjustment by treaty. With the German Empire frequent ques tions arise in connection with the subjects of naturalization and expatriation ; but the Imperial Government bus constantly mani fested a desire to strictly maintain and com ; piy with all treaty stipulations in regard to them. Inconsequence of the omission of Con gress to provide for a diplomatic represen tative at Athens the legation to Greece has been withdrawn. There is now no chan nel of diplomatic communication between j the two countries, and the expediency of ! providing for one in some form is submit ted to Congress. ^Relations with Austria, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, and Belgium cuntinue amicable^ .and marked hf no incident of ; espccial importance. | . ; .of | jf her ; pur -ous J ; bend ol t he Seets*- Bg/pt bM ,akei' p'mo. no ?wnie, however, has occurred in thereto ThpV^i^i' ancl Hle United State*. The action of the Egyptian Government In presenting to the city of New Jfork one of ,tbe ancient obelisks, which po^ess such historic Interest, Is highly appreciated as a generous mark of International regard If prosperity should attend the enterprise of its transportation across the Atlantic it* erection in a conspicuous position in the chief commercial city of the nation will soon be accomplished. The treaty recently made between Japan and the United States in regard to the re vision of former commercial treaties, it is now believed, will be followed by similar action on the part of other treaty powers. The attention of Congress is again invited to the subject of the indemnity funds re ceived some years since from Japan and China, which, with their accumulated in terest, now amount to considerable sums. If any part of these funds is justly due to American citizens they should receive it promptly; and whatever may have been received by this Government in excess of I strictly just demands should in some form be returned to the nations to whom it equi tably belong*. The Government of China has signified its willingness to consider the question of the emigration of its subject to the United States with a dispassionate fairness, and to corporate in such measures a< may tend to prevent injurious consequences to the United States. The negotiations are ?till proceeding, and will be pressed with dili gence. A question having arisen between China and Japan about the Lew Chew islands, the United States Government has taken mea sures to inform those Powers of its readi ness to extend its good offices for the main tenance of peace, if they shall mutually deem it desirable, and find it practicable to avail themselves of the proffer. It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two nations on each side of the Rio Grande under the instructions of their respective Governments, raic'sand depredations have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly most dcstrtiCiveTbave now almost wholly ceased. In view of this re sult, I entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders a- to crossing the bor der, without encouraging such" disturb ances as would endanger the peace of the two count ries. The third instalment of the award against Mexico undor the Claims Commission of July 4, 1SGS. was duly paid, and has been put in course of distribution in pursuance of the aet of Congress providing for the same. This satisfactory situation befween the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with .Mexico, and an increased contribution of c ipltal and in dustry by our people to the development of the great resources of that country. I earnestly commend to the wisdom of "Con gress the provision of suitable legislation looking to this result. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is again fully re-tored by the arrival of a Min ister from that country to the United State*. This is especially fortunate in view of the fact i hat the question of an inter-oceanic canal lias recently assumed a new and im portant aspect, and is now under discus sion with the Central American countries through whose territory tiic canal", bv the Nicaragua route, would have to pass. It is trusted that enlightcne ! statesmanship on their part will sec that the early prose cution of such a work will largely enure to the benefit not only of their own citizens and those of the United States, but of the comuiercc of the civilized world. If is not doubted that should the work he un dertaken under the protective auspices of the United States, aud upon satisfactory concessions for the ri-hr of way. and its security by the Central American govern ments, the capital for its completion would be readily furnished from this country and Europe, which might, failing such guaran tees, prove inaccessible. Diplomatic relations with Chill have also been strengthened by the reception of a Minister from that country. The war between l'eru, I.olivia, and Chili still continues. The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter further than to convey to all the Governments concerned the as?urance that the friendly otlices of. the Government of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis will be ex tended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations continue with Brazil and ! the Argentine Republic, and trade with those countries is improving. A provision for regular ardmore frequent mail commu nication in our own ships between the ports of flu's country and the nations of South America seems to me to deserve the atteniion of Congress as an essential p'e ! cursor of an enlargement of our commerce with them and an extension of our carrying trade. A recent revolution in Venezuela lias been followed by the establishment of a provisional government. This Government has not yet been formally recognized, and it is deemed desirable lo await the proposed action of the people, wnieh is expected to give it the sanction of constitutional forms. A naval vessel has been sent to theSa moan Island to make surveys and take pos session of the privileges ceded to the United Stiles by Samoa, in the harbor of Pago Pago. A coaling-station i? to be established there, which will be convenient and useful to United States vessels. The subject of opening diplomatic rela tions with Roumania and Servia, now be come independent sovereignties, is at pre sent under consideration, atid is the subject of diplomatic correspondence. There Is a gratifjing increase of trade with nearly all European and American countries, and i' ;s believed tha' with judi cious action in regard to its development it can and will be still more enhanced, and that Ameiic:tn products and manufactures will tind new and expanding markets. The reports of diplomatic and consular officers upon t his subject, under the system now adopted, have resulted in obtaining much valuable information, which has been and will continue to be laid be/ore Congress and the public from time to I inn*. The third article of the treaty with Rus sia of March 30, 1807, by which Alaska was ceded to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of t tie ceded temtory, with the exception of the 'uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted lo the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States, and *hall be maintained and pro tected in t tic free enjoy inert cf their liber ty, property, and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subject to such laws arid regula tions as the United States may from time to time adopt in regard to the abori^lnal'tnbes of that country. lioth the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people require that some organized form of government over the Territory of Alaska l?c adopted. There appears lo be no law for the ar rest of persons charged with common law offences, such as assault, robbc rv, and murder, and no magistrate authorized to issue or execute proce-s in such cases. Se rious difficulties have already arisen from offences of this character, not only among ihe original inhabitants, but among citizens of the United States and other countries who have engaged iu minim?, fishing, aud other business operations within the Terri tory. A bill authorizing the appointment of justices of the peace and constables and the arrest and detention of persons charged with criminal offences, and providing for an appeal to United Stages courts for the dis trict of Oregon iu suitable cases, will at a proper time be submitted to Congress. The attention of Congress 1$ called to the annual report of the Secretary of the Trea sury on the condition of the public finances. The ordinary revenues from ail sources | for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1879, were $273,827,184 46; the ordinary expenditure# for the same period were 6266,047,883.33; leaving a surplus revenue for the year of $6,870,300.03. . i .!
