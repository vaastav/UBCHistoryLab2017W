The messairo as read is as follows; To the Senate and House of Representatives: In subnilttiuR my annual meMiira to congress. I have great satisfaction In bolntf ab!e to say that tho general condition unvoting the com tnerctnl and industrial Interests of the Unlud States arc in the highest de.t;roo favorable, lu com pur boo of tho existing condition with those of the moat favorable period In the his tory of the country will, 1 believe, show that bo ntKh a decree 01 prosperity and bo general diffusion of the comforts of life were never be fore enjoyed by our peonln.

Of the 40 cotton mills 21 have been built in the southern states. Mr. A. H Shop person, of the New York Cotton exchange, est. mates that tho number of working spindles In the United States on September 18:2, at 15,201,000, an increase of MO,ono over tho year 1891. The consumption of cotton by American mills in lhVl was JUOdOOO bales, and In Z.ftVi.OX) bales, au Increase of 188,00) baloa. From Uie year 1800 to lbfci, in elusive, thore has been an Increase In the con sumption of cotton In Europe of W per cent while during the same period tho Increase of consumption in the United States has boon about 10 per cent The report of Mr. Ira Ay or, special nent of the treasury department, shows thai at the date of September 30, itfi)2, there were thirty- two companies manufacturing tin ami terno plate in the United States and fourteen com panies building new works fur such manufict ure. The estimated investment of capital In buildings and plants at the close of the fiscal year June 00, i8i;t, if existing conditions were to be continued, was 0w,iXK, anb the estimated rate of production 800,0 0,0u0 pounds per num. The actual production for the quarter tnntng September au, inn, was m,T,,7.'5 pounds The report of Labor Commissioner Peck, of New York, shows that during th yrar 1 8-' I, In about 6,00) manufacturing establishments la that state embraced within the special inquiry made by hm, and representing siity-sevea dif ferent Industries, there was a net increase over the year 189J of 31 ,81ft, 13J.08 in the value of the product, and of 16," in tho amount of acs paid.

During the last six months of the year 181 and the frst six mouths of 132 the total pro duction of rig Iron was &,7iO,81S tons, as against B.209,703 tons in the year I M0. which was the largest annual production ever Attained. For the same twelve months of I99MU.2 the pro duction of B'aemer Ingots was 3.w;8,Nl tons, an increase of 18J.710 gross tons over the previously unprecedented yearly production of 3,6,H71 gross tons in 1SV0 The production of Uessemer steel raits for the first six months of ifiitt, was 7:2,46 gross tons, as against TO'.iso gross tons during the last six months of 1801. The total valujofour foreign trade (exports nd manufactures) diirlng the lnsl fiscal year wasU.fc5;.tiii ).,0, an Increase of U,2'W,(K4 over the fiscal year. The average annual valne of our Import and exports of merchandise for the ten fiscal years prior to WiiR, was tl,4.r;.322,OlB. It will be observed that our foreign trade for !W"J exceeded this annual average value by liOJ.3 8,301, an Increase of f7 4; per cent The significant and value of this Increase are shown by the fact that the excess In the trade of JSJi, over 1HB1, was wholly in the value of expirta, for there was a decrease In the value of Im ports, of !l7,M3,t;5l The value of our exports during the fiscal year lWi ranched the highest figures in the his tory of tho government, amounting to l,0,27s,tlR, excvodlng by fi47r,3ia the ex ports of 1MM and extending the value of the im ports by !22,S7.G.H A comparison of thevalue of our imports for IHtf! with the annual average for the ten rears prior to ifiwi uliows an excess Of 1265,142.67!, or of 34.65 percent Th vtlue of our Imports of merchandise for Wt, which was s2,4ie,4fl";, also exceeded the annual average value of the ten years prior to IW1 br 1 1 35. 21 A (U0. During the fiscal year IKii the val ie or Imports free of duty amounted to I i57.&y0.658, the largest aggregate in the history of our com merce The value of the imports of merchan dise entered free of duty In lt9l was 55 35 per cent of the total value of imports, as compared with 43.35 per cent in im and 3163 per cent In IF I. In our cosAtwlse trade a most eneourrlng development la In protfres, there hiving been In the Ioai four veara an increase of 16 per cent In internal commerce, the statistics show that too such period of prosperity has ever before existed. The freight carried In the coastwise trade of the great lakes In l"OJ aggregated 28, t 5 9 9 ions. On the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio rivers and tributaries in the same yesr the traffic ag gregated ;.9.404,4i6 tons and the total veeael ton bige passing through the Detroit ri'.rr during that year was 2i.6Hi.0tw tons. The Ten sel ton nage entered fed cleared tn the forHirn trade of London during 1.J mounted to 13.4Ht.7S7 tona, nd of Liverpool 10.wt.SW tons, a total for these two great shipp ng ports of 84. 422.5 tons, only lightly in excess of the vesvl tonnage parsing through the Detroit river. And it should be said that the season f-r the Detroit river was but 2-8 d rs, while of course in London and Liverpool the aeason was for the entire year. The vessel tonnage pissing through the St Kit's cid1 for the fiscal year amounted to9 Xr4 tons and the fre'ebt tonnare of the Detroit river is estimated for that yearat&V C0VJ03 tons, against U,3W Sis tons is lwo.

It Is true that the market prices of cotton and wheut have been low. It Is one of the unfavorable incident uf agriculture that the farmer cannot produce upou orders. He must sow and reap lu ignorance of the aggregate pro duction of the year, and la peculiarly subject to the depreciation which follows oVer production. Hut while tho facts I have stated are true as to the crops I have mentioned, the gcueiul aver-ai-'e of prices hs beuti such as to givo to ugrl culture a fair participation lu the geuerul pros perity. Tho value of our tpiul farm prod icts has Increased from ll.iidi 010 fca-Ma 1K0J toH, 50 J, a "0,0 JO lu ln'l, as uNtiinated by sUitisilcians, an increase of 8o per cent The number of hogs January 1, l.H, was 5,a.T,iul uud their value 210,ltfi,J5.

If any are discontented with their state here; if any believe that the wages or prices, the return for honest toll, are Inade quate, they should not fail to rernrmbor that there Is no o:her country in the world where the conditions that neemtotheni bird, would not be accepted as highly prosperous. The English agriculturist Would be gUJ to ex change the returns of his labor tor thoac of the American farmer and tho Manchester work men their Wages for these of their fellows at Fidl Kiver. 1 believe that Ihe protective system which now for something like thirty years has pro vailed in our legislation has been a mighty in strument for the development of our national wealth and a most powerful airency in protect ing the homes of our workiugmen from the in vasion of want 1 have felt a most solicitous Interest to preserve to our working people rates of wages that would not only give daily bread, but supply a comfortable margin for those home attractions and family com forts and enjoyments without which life is neither hopeful nor sweet They are Amer ican citizens a part of the gnat people for whom our constitution and government were framed and Instituted and it can no I be a per version of that constitution to so legislate as to preserve iu their homes the comfort, inde pendence, loyalty and sense of interest lu the government which are essential to good citi- tenship and which will bring tho in, us in UC1, to the defense of the flug wheu U is assailed. It is not my purpose to renew h 're the argu ment in favor of a protective UrifT Tuo result of the recent olectioa must be accepted aa hav ing Introduced anew poiiey. We must assume that the present tariff, constructed upon the lines of protection, is to be repealed and that there la to bo substituted for it a tariff law constructed solely with reference to revenue; that no duty is to be higher because the in crease win kocp open an American mill keep up the wages of an American work man, but that iu every case such a rate of duty is to be Imposrd as will bring the treasury of the United States the largest returns of revenue. The contention has not been between schedules, but between principles and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevallinj party will not carry into legislation the principles ad vocated by It and the piedg-s given to i he peo ple. The tariff bills pasted by tho house of representatives of tho Usi session were. I sup posed, even in the opinion of their promoters Inadequate and Justified only by the fact that the senate and houie of representatives were not In accord and that a gem-ral revision could not, therefore, be undertaken I recommend that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the incoming congress It ia matter of regret that th's work mut be de layed for at least three months, for the threat of great tariff changes Introduces so much un certainty that au amount not easily estlm ft teJt business inaction and of diminished productic will necessarily result It is possible also th:. this uncertainty may result iu de-roaHed reve nues from customs du tied. for our merchants will make cautious orders for foreign goods in view of tho prospect of tariff reduction and Uxi un certainty as to when it will tuka t fleet Thone who have advoaated a protective tariff can well afford to have their disastrous fore casts of a change of policy disaupotntod. If a system of custom duties can by framed thit will set tho idle wheels -:nd Worn ut Kuropc iu motion and crowd our wurehouus with foreigu made goods and at tho saute time keep our mills busy: that will give us an iuerejed partli lpa tlon In "the markets of the world" of a greater value than the home nmrket that wesurrender; that will give Increased work to foreign work men upon products to be oennumed by our peo ple without diminishing the amount of work to bo done hero; that will enable the American manufacturer to p ly to his worktn-n from M to l.v percent more in wages thin U tnM In the foreign mill and yet to compete in our mar kets and In forelpn markets with the foreign producer; that will further reduce the cost of articles of war and fod without reducing the wages uf those who produce them; that can be celebrated, uftsr its effects have been realized, as lis expectation lias fcen in Europe, as well as in American cities, the au thors and promoters of It will In- entitled to the highest praise. We have had in our history several experiences of the contrasted efCets of revenue and uf a protective tariff: but this generation has not felt thciu and the experi ence of one generation Is not highly Instructive to the nett The frieuds of the pntm:tivo sys tem, wl'h undiminished confidence in the prin ciples they have advocated, will await the re sults of the new experiment The struiued and too of ion disturbed relations existing between the eniploves and employers In our great manufacturing establishments have not been favorable to a consideration by the wage earher of the effect upon wages of the protective system. The fact that his wages were the highest paid in the like callings of the world and that a maintenance of this rato of wna-es In the ab sence of protective dutirs upon the product of hfs labor, was impossible, were obscured by the passion evoked by these contests. He mar now be nt,le to review the question in tho light of his personal experience under the operation of a tariff for revenue only. If that experience shall demonstrate that present rates of wages are thereby maintained er increas-d, cither ab solutely or in their purchasing ptwer and thnt the aggregate volume cf w ork to bo done In this country Is increased or even mtintain'-d: that there are more or as many davs' work in a year at as good or better waea for the American workman as hs been the cae under the pro tective system every one will rejoice. A gen eral process of wage reduction cannot be con templated by any pitrlolio citizen without tUc gravest apprehension. It may be, indeed, I believe is, possible for the American manufacturer to compete successfully with h'.s foreign rival In many branches of production ithout the defense of protective dut es, if the pay mils are equalized but th3 conflict that stands between the producer and that result and the distress of the peopl", when it In at tained, are not pleasant to contrnip'ate. Tho society of the unemployed, now balding its fre quent and threatening parados in the streets of fornicn cities, should not le allowed to acquire aa American domicile It port of Departments. Tbe reports of the heads of the several execu tive departments, which are herewith sub mitted, have very naturally Included a resume of the whole work of the administration, with the transactions of the last fiscal year.

There has beeu a larpn in crease la the value of imports from all these countries since the commercial agreements weut Into effect amounting to 7),2,H?2, but It ha? been entirely in import from the American countries, consisting mostly of sugar, coffee, India ruhtier and crude drugs. The alarmed attention of our Kurtpsn competitors for the South American market Ins been attracted to this new American policy and to our acquisi tion and their lots of South American trade. TIJK CAADIA DirriCULTlKS. A treaty providing for the arbitration of the depute between Grent lirltaln and the united Stales as to the killing of seals in the Behrlng sea wus concluded on tho 19th of February last This treaty was accompanied by an agreement prohibiting pelagic sealing pending the arhltra lion and a vigorous effort was made durlntr this He uon to drive out all poaching steamers from the lit bring sea. The esse of the United States for the tr'.hunal of arbitration ban been prepared with great care and industry by Hon. John W. Foster, and the counsel who represent this government ex press confidence that a result substantially es tabliahmg our claims and preserving this great industry to the benefit of all nations will be at tamed. During tho past yoar a suggestion was re ceived through the UriUh minister that the Ca nadian government would like to confer as to the pottfcibllity of enlarging up-m terms of mutual advantage the commercial exchanges of Canada and of the United States, and a eon- fcreucc was tv'ld at Washington with Mr ltiaiue acting fur this government, aud the Uritish min ister at this capital and three members of the do minion cabinet acting us eomrms doners on the part of Great llrttatn. Ttio conference devel oped the fact that the Canudiun government was only prepared to offer to the United States in exchange for the concessions united, tha ad- mission of natural products. The statements .they made that favored rates could not be given to the United States as against the mother country. This admission as foreseen necessarily terminated tho conference upon this question. The benefits of an exchange of tho natural products would be almost wholly wiih the peo p e of Canada. Other topics of interest were considered in the conference and have resulted in the making of a eon vent km for examining the Alaskan boundary, the waters of Passama quodd buy adjacent 10 K as t port. Ma, and on the initiation of an srrrugomenl for the protec tion of fish life in tha coterminous and neigh boring waters of our north boundary. The controversy as to the tolls upon tho Wei land canal, which was presented to congress at the last session by upecial message, having failed of adjustment. I felt cotistrslned to ox- ercise the authority conferred by the act of July 26, 102, and to proclaim a suspension of the free use of St Marys Falls cmal to cargoes u transit to ports In Canada. The secretary of 1 treasury rstabllhed such tolls as were ... Jtight lo be equivalent to the exactions ua , ,stly levied upon our commerue iu the Can dutn canals if, as we must suppose, tho political rclatiops of Canada and tho disposition of the Canadian government, are to rwmalu uuchanVd, a some what radical revision of our tradu relations should, I think, ho mad a Our relations must coutlnue to bj intimate, and they should be frii udly. I regret tj bay, however, that in many of the controversies, notably those as to the Usher iu on the Atlantic, the scaling interims on the Pacific and tho cauul tolls, our negotiations with Great Uritain have tontinuoiuly been thwarted or retarded by unreasonable aud un- frit udly objections and protests from Cauada. In the matter of the canal tolls, our treaty rlghh were flagrantly disregarded. It Is htird- ly too much to say that the Canadian Pacific and other railway linos which parallel our northern boundary are sustained by commerce hivint Its origin or the originators, or both, in the Untied Slates. The Canadian railroads compete with those of the United Slates for our t raffia and without the restraints of our in ter-state commerce act Their cars.pass almost without detention In aud out of our territory. The Cunndlan Pacific railway brought into tho United States from China and Japan via British Columbia during the year ended Juno a). 189. 2.l.x:t9.6s9 pounds of freight and it carried from the u utted Stutes to be shipped to China and Japan via liritish Columbia 24.U6S.M6 pounds of freight There were also shipped from the Uuited Stau a ovor this road from eastern ports of ths V nlted States government and Pacific ports dur. ing the same year, 13,91 2, 01 3 pounds of fro ght and there were received over this read at the ( nited States eastern ports from ports on the Pacific coast lSJWi 3li pounds of freignt Mr Joseph Mintno, former fht-fof the burCiuof suatlstlts, wheu before the senate eommltlee on relations with Cannda, April Tfi, 1R, said that thevalue of goods thus transported between different points in the United States ncroj-s Canadian territory, probably amounts to llUOou tXX) a year. ' There is no disposition on the part of th peo ple or government of tru' United States to In terlere in the smillest decree with the political relations of Canada That question Is wholly with her on people. H is time for us, how ever, to consider whether, if the present state of thing and trend of things is to continue our nterehangos upon lines of laud transportation should not be put upon a different basis, and our entire Independence of Canadian ca- n:ils and of the St Lawrence outlet to tho fiea secured by the construction of an American canal around the falls of Niagara and the opening of ship com munication between the great lakes aud one of our own sea ports. Wc should not hesitate to avail ourselves of our great natural trade ad vantage. We should withdraw tho supptrt which is given to the railroad nnd steamship lines or Canals, by a traffic, thit projKrly be longs to us and no Ion ;er furnish th earnings which liiliteo the otherwise crushing weight of th-1 ennrtntin pu iio subsidies that have b given to them The object of the power of the treasury to deal with this matter without further legislation has b"e:i under considera tion, but circumstance! have postponed a con clusion. It is probable that a consideration of the propriety of a modification or abrogation of the article of the treaty of Washington relating lo the trans1 1 of goods in bona is involved in any complete solution or the question. T11K 

AFFA1H WITII CHILI, Congress at the last session was advised of the progress of tho threatening differences with the republic of Chili. It gives me uow great gratification to report that the Chilian govern ment, in a most fricndlv and honorable spirit, has tendTed and paid as an Indemnity to the fa tn Mies of the sailor. of the Baltimore who were killed and to thoso who were injured In th" outbreak in tho city of Valparaiso the sum of J7.vk, This has been accepd, not only as an indemnity for a wmn? done, but as a mot gratifying evidence fhat the government of Ctrl! rightly appreciates the disposition of this government to act In a spirit of absolute fair ness and friendliness in our intercourse wiih ti:at brave people. A further nnd conclusive evidence of the mutuil respect and confidence now exisiing is iurmshui by the fact that a convention submitting to arbitration the mu tual claims of the citizens of tho respective governments has ben agreed upon. Some of thee claims have been pending for muny years and havo bevn the occasion of muh unsatis factory diplomatic corrcspmdence. I have endeavored in every way to as-iure our sister republics of Central and South America that tho United States government and its people have only the most fri:nily dipoM t'on toward them all. We do not covet ihir territory. We have no disposition to be oppressive or exacting tn our dealings with any of them, even the weakest Our intervals and our hops for them sll lie in the direction of stable pvernm?nta hy ther people and of tbe largest development of their commercial resources. The mutual ' bene flta of enlarged commercial intercourse with our people we do desire and in this have sought their friendly co-operatU n. j 1 have believe.!, however, while holding these I seniimtnts in the greatest s-ncertty, that we t tr. nst ir,si"-t upon a ju.st ri'ioibiiiy for any ir.jurica inflictt-d upon our offl -al r p-senta-tivs or tit -on cur citizens This fnatstance 'a ndly nod justly, bur firmly made, will 1 lo--f w irom.Le p- ace a?.d mutual respect OTItKR rOUriS MATTEI'.a O :r r-'uiions with H waii have been w h as 1 toatiratt an iu.-m-d iTi'rt-st and muil con- : tir.ue to .:;i I -l1' tn it id emit i.x.p )rt;iii' e th it j lbs projccud subxariue cabie, a survey for j Which has been made, should be promoted both for naval and commercial uses. We should have quick communication. We should before have availed ourselves of the concussion, made many tears ago to this government for a harbor and naval station at Pearl river. Many evidences bf the friendliness of the Ilawaian government nave been given In the past and it is gratifying to believe that the advuntuge and necessity of a continuance of very clone relations is appre ciated. The friendly act of this govornmrnt in ex pressing to the government of Italy Its repro bation and abhorrence of tho lynching of Ital ian subjeota lu New Orleans by the payment of PJiMXJu francs, or t21,.muu, was accepted by the king of Italy with every manifestation of grate ful appreciation, and the incident has been highly promotive of mutual respect and good will. In consequence of tho action of the Trench government tn proclaiming a protectorate over certain tribal districts of the west coast of Africa, eastward of the Sau Pedro river, I have felt constrained to make protest against this encroachment upon the territory of a republic-which was founded by citizens of the United States and toward which this coun try has for many years hold the intimate rela tion of a friendly counsel. The recent disturbances of the public peace by lawless foreign marauders on the Mexican frontier have afforded the govorument an op portunity to testiTy Itngood will toward Mexico and its earnest purpose to fulfill Its obligations of international friendship by pursuing aud dis persing the evil doers. The work of relocating the boundary of tho treaty of Uuadalupe III daigo wettlward from Ki Paso is progressing favorably. Our intercourse with Spain continues on good terms. I regret, however, not to be able to re port as yet the adjustment of Ibe claims of the American missionaries arising from tho dls orders at Ponape, lu the Caroline Islands, but I anticipate a satisfactory adjustment of ur gent representations to tho government at Madrid The treatment of the relig ious aud educational establishments of American citlaens in Turkey has of late called for more than tho usual share of attention. A tendency to curtail the toleration which has so beneficially prevailed la discernible and has called forth tho earnest remonstrances of this government Harassing regulations in regard to schools and churches havo be -n attempted In certain localities, but not without due pro test and the assertion of tho inherent and con ventional rights of our countrymen Violations of domicile and search of the persons and ef fects of citizens of the United States by appar ently Irresponsible officials in tho Asiatic vil laycts have from time to time been reported. An aggravated instance of injury to the proper ty of un American missionary at Bourdeur. in the province of Kont, called forth an urgent claim for reparation which. lam pleased lo say, was promptly heeded by the government of the porto. Interference with the trading ventures of our citizens in Asia Minor in also reported, and the lack of consular represen tation 1b that region ts a serious draw back to Instant and effective protection. I cannot believe that these incidents represents settled policy and shall not cease to urge the adoption of proper remedies. International copyright h.s been extended to Italy by proclamation in conformation with the act of March 3, lfiU, upon assurance beinggiven that Italian law ermlts to citizens of the United States the benefit of copyright on sub stantially tho same basis as the subjects of Italy. Hy a special convention proclaimed January 11W2, reciprocal provisions of copyright hive ben applied between tho UntteJ States and Germany. Negotiations are In progress with other countries to the s une end. I repeat with great earnestness the reoom mendatlon which I havo made mention In previous messigeg to the Inadequate support given the American company engaged In con struction of tho Nicaragua ship canal. It Is ImposHlb'e to over state the value from every standpoint of this great enterprise, and I hope there may be time given in this congress to give toltau Impetus that will iusuro the early completion of the canU and secure to tho United States its proper relations to It when completed, TUB MONKTABY CONFEKRNOB. Congress has already boon advised that tha Invitattonu of the government for the assemb ling of an international monetary conference to consider the question of an. enlarged lssuo of silver was accepted by the nations to which they were issued. The conference assembled at Brussels on the 22nd of November, and has entered upon the consideration of this great question. 1 have not doubted and have taken occasion to express that belief, as well in the invitations issued for this conference, as in my public messages, that tho free coinage of silver upon an ngrteJ international ratio woulJ great ly promote the interests of our people and equally those of other nations, it is loo early to predict what results may be accomplished by the conference. If any temporary check or do- lay Intervenes,' I believe that very soon com mercial conditions will compel the now reluct ant governments to unite with us in this move ment to secure the enlargement of the volume of money needed for tho transaction of the business of the world Executive Departments. THE TRICASUHY. Tho report of the secretary of the treasury will attract special interest in view of the many misleading statements as havo been made as to the state of public revenue.!. Three preliminary facts should not only be staled but emphasised before looking luto details: Kir.it, that the public debt has been reuueod since March, 1SS), S5.0r4,2OU, and the annual interest chargos Vll,ftHl,ltH; second, that there have been paid out for tensions during tlus administration un up to November I, IM'rfJ, 932. 564, 178.

If thore are any mho still think that the surplus should have been kept out ot circulation by hoarding it in the treasury, or depositing it in banks with out interests while the government con tinued lo pay the very banks interest. upon tho bonds deposited as security for the deposits, or who think that the extended pr slon legislation was a public rubbery, or that the duty on sujrar should havo been m ilntaiued, lam content to leave tho argument where It now rests, while we wait to see whether these criticisms will lake the form of legislation. The reveuues of the fiscal year en ling June , 112, from all sources, w.ro U2ta3,26J 22, and the expenditures for all purposes were 115.9 1.5 1, leaving a balance uf 1.914 45a CO.

The net loss of revenue from all sources was 32,tU5,9."i.81. The revenues, estimated and actual, for the year ending Juno 18'3, are placed by the secretary at Met, 130, ioJ. 41, and the expendi tures at f4'd,3JV4 showing a surplus of receipts over expenditures of ?2.(XV)0i0. The cash balance in the treasury at th- end of tho fiscal year, it Is estimated, will bo fSJ.DJJ, SMU So far as th se figures aro based on estimates of receipts and expenditures for tho remaining months of tho current fiscal year, there aro not only the usual elements of uncertainty but some ailed elements. New revenue legislation, or even th? expectation of it, may seriously re duce the public revenues during tho period of uneertimty and during the press of business adjustment to tho new conditions when they become known. But the secretary lias very wisely refrained from guessing as to the effect of possible chimes in sur revenue laws, since the scope or those changes and the ti-ne of their taking effect cannot in any degree be forecast or foretold by h.m. His estimates must be ; based up n existing laws ani upjn a continu ance of existing buines condition, except so far as thee conditions may be affected by causes other than new legislation. 3'he estimated receipts for the fiscal y?ar June 30, JtfcM, are f 1.0 121,35 M. and the esti mated appropriations (457,261. 8J 5. 3& leaving an estimated surplus of receipts over the ex- penairures of s&i, 60.Oa This does not in clude any pirment to the sinking fund. In the reeommenudtion of the secretary that the sink ing fund law bs repealed I concur. The re demption of bonds since the passage of the law to June j, 1MS2, has already exceeded the re quirements by the sum of 910,661.49 The tfrementof bonds in the future before ma turity abould be a matter of convenience, not of compultdoa.

The conditions upon what we have c illed th "frontier" have heretofore required the maintenance of many small posts, bur niw the policy of concentra tion is obviously the right one. The now poiU should have the r-ropcr stragetic relations to th only "frontiers' wo now have, those of the seacoast aud of the northern part of our south ern boundary. I do not think that any question of advantage, in localities, or states, should de termine the loeatlou of tbe new posts The organisation and eulargemant of th bureau of military Information which the aereury his effected is n work the usefulness of which will iMvomecvery year moreapparent The work of building heavy guns mil tho construction of coast defenses has been well begun and should 00 carried on without check. jrvncR. , The report of the at tomey-general is by law submitted direcily to congress, but I cannot refrain frjrn sayinr thit be has conducted the Increasing work of the department of Justice with great profes sional skill. Ho h.s iu severa' directions se cured from the courts decisions miking in croased protection to tho officers of th.

Tho numerous applications for executive clemency presented in behalf of persons con victed in the tinted States courts and g.Vcn penitentiary leniences have called my atten tion to a fact referred to by tho attorney gen eral in his report, namely that a time allowance for good behavior for such prisoners Is prescribed by th federal statutes only where tho state In which the pen itentiary is located had made nosuch provision PrUoners are given the benefit of tho provi sions of the statn law regulating the iK'niten- ttary to which tlioy mw be sent. These aro various, some perhaps too liberal and some, per haps too till be rat The result Is a sentence for five years means one thing if tho prisoner is sent to one state for confinement, and quite a different thing if he is sent b another. 1 rec ommend a uniform credit for good behavior be prescribed bv congress. 1 havo before expressed my roneorrence In tho recommendation of tho uttoruev general that degrees of minder shall bo recognized in the federal statutes, as they are, I believe, in all tho states. Thee grades are founded on correct distinction In crime, Tuo recog nition of thrai would enable the courts to exercise some discretion in apportion ing punhtbmonl and would greatly relieve the executive of what Is coming to be a very heavy burden -the examination ofthe.se cases on application fur commutation. 1 'I hu aggregate of claim pending in ; the court of claims is enormoua ciaims tc tho amount of nearly W,u w,ooj fur injury tc I persons ciu lining to b loyal duiimj the war arc J now before th it court for examination.

The deficiency of the present tlseai year it Is esttmtod will be reduced to fl.7Y.',?3, which will not only be extinguished during the next fiscal year, but a surplus of nearly H,(AV 000 should there be shown. In these calculations the pavm -nts lo be mn 1 under the contracts for ocean mail servic have not been inclu led.

The postmaster-general has ex tended to the post offices in the larger cities the merit of promotion. Introduced by my di rection, into tho departments here, and it has resulted there, as in thedt partments, in a large volume of work, and that better done. Kver inee our merchant marine was driven from the sea by the rebel cruisers during the warof the rebellion, tho Uuitel States h;is been paying an enormous annual tribute to foreign countries In the shape of freight nn.l passenger moneys, our grain and meats have b.en taken at our own docks and o ur larire imports there laid down by foreign shipmasters. An increas ing torrent of American travel to Kurope has contributed a vast sura annuallv to the divi dends of foreign tdiip owners. The balance of trade shown by the books of our cutom hus4s has been largely reduced and iu many years altogether extinguished by ibis constant strain In tho year lsa only 12 3 per cent, of our imp rts were brought in American Teasels.

If we could enter into conforeue with other competitions and all would atrree to with- hold government aid, we could perhaps take om chances with the rent, but our great competitors have established and maintained their lines by government subsidies until now they have prac- nuy excluded us from participation.
