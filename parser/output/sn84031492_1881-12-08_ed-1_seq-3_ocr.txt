William Crusso, an omp!oy6 of tho telephone company, was sent to Aug's to correct some trouble com plained of on the lino, which was supposed to bo a swinging cross. Ho talked over tho wiru to tho Fourth and Walnut Exchange, and took tbo telephone from bis cur fur au Instant, when ho was moro than startled by a violent shock, accompanied by pugs of smoko from tho microphone and telephone) and a.

Tho uceldont could only have resuUud by tho crossing of (ho electric light uud telephone wires, and the contact was probably only for an instant. When tbo microphone and telephone wero taken off and examined, it was found that tho Induction coils bud boon burned to a crisp and some o! tho luotal fused Naturally this set tho telephone people to thinking, and they wero not slow to ar rive at tbo conclusion that, If Crusso had bad tbo tnlophono against bis oar when tbo coutuct of wires occurred, ho would bavo eternally lost tbo clmnco of promotion or discharge. Tbo ruined Instruments wero sent to tho Fourth and Wal nut olllco and carefully examined by exports, who wero of tbo opinion that thoro wns a do elded probability of danger from tbo wires com ing in contact, and suggestions wero made that tho mutter bo put to a practical test.

Lorlng, United States Commissioner of Agri culture, addressed tho Convention of tho Na tional Cotton-Planters’ Association at (ho Expo sition Grounds today. Opening his address with an allusion to tbo rapid growth of American en terprise and tho Increase of towns, cities, and educational and religious Institutions, tho speaker sketched tho rapid Increase of agri cultural and during tho lust ten years, and then passed to n discus sion of tho relations which oxlst between tbo American Industries and tholr mutual support of ouch other, as follows: TUB DEPENDENCE OF AOIIICULTURK ON MANUFACTURED I hnro alluded to the producing power of tho American people: but. In order to understand the rotations which exist between our Industries, we sliould; l not forget uur consuming capacity also. Of tho flfi,ooo,loXl,ooo produced by our various Industries, nearly f 14,000,000,000 are consumed at homo. It Is tho homo market to which tho American producer turns most naturally, let his Industry be what It limy, lu fact, the law of uur largest oud must widely-diffused Industry, agriculture, is the cultivation of those craps which nru adapted to u local market, and tno occupation of lands lying near such n market. Nut yet Inis this law become universal, Ills true; but It applies to all tho older uud thickly-settled seollunsof our land, and goes with diversified Industries wherever they create large cities and towns. Fitly yours ago tho farmer was com pelled to seek his market near home on account ot tbo diilluuity which attended tlio transportation of Inserops. Rut tho settling of new und remote lands and Improved methods of transportation rendered the growing of tho great staples u ne cessity, and corn, wheat, and provisions occu pied tho farmer's attention, and opened to him remote und uvon foreign markets fur bis gains. This Irnntler farming, however, Is but tempo rary, and must bo followed by that systematic husbandry which constitutes tho legitlmulu business of the American farmer, und carries him hack (o those days when agriculture was al most tho solo business of tho country, and when n farmiug community wns UNIFORMLY PROSPEROUS WHEN PRUDENT AND INDUSTRIOUS. Until our lanru towns and our manufacturing Biatcs, therefore, provide markets for u large, portion or tho products of the pastures mid grain-fields of tdo West, they aim support that more profitable system which consists In h euro nil culilvnilon of tho soil, and hi tho economical management of small lurms. Tho trade of this homo market to which 1 buvo alluded is Immense, and tho sources of supply hi all their variety format! Interuslhtfr topiu for cnnslderuUon. New England requires about cu.eoo,ooo bushels of wheat and produces only I.CjO.OUIi. Now York uses about iW.uuo.uoi) ami grows about lii.uou.ouo. Tho supply of this deficiency comes from tho West, trom tho Ohio Valley und tho prairies west of tho Mississippi aud of tho Missouri, mid coats from Siu.ouu.ouo to fW.tXXMHM) m years of good production, but still moro lu tho present year of comparative scarcity. To ussumu from the tact that Now York goes West for six-tenths ot her wheat-supply that wheat-growing is AN 

UNPIIOFITABM: INDUBTUV, there would bo un unsafe and unreliable con clusion. There are cightcmintlcs south of Luke Ontario which yielded In IB7U «,ÜB«.M7 bushels ou acres, or IS.U bushels per acre, a rate more than 50 per cent nbovo that of Miuuesota or Dakota, and sumewbuc higher than that of California for tho sumo year. Thus an impor tant part of the dellolcnoy of other comities In New York was supplied by tho surplus grown In the Seneca Valley aud Its neighborhood. There la another district, lying eastward towards tho Hudson aud southward towards tho Delaware, that finds a greater profit lu tho dairy, making a production lit butter and cheese worth far moro tbau tho grain procured from tho West. Not only uro the homo wants In dairy products supplied, hut a largo share of tho ]fiu,uou,uuo to l-td.OOO.Uuo pounds of cheeso exported from year to year Is credited to this district, bringing n vast amount of money from Europe, a part of which only is credited to tho aid of the Western wheat growing. Going still nuaror tho seaboard, to Dutchess and Westchester and tho fruitful sands of Long island, we find tnoru people and less wheat, and tho soli devoted to SIAIIKBT OAIIDHNINO, yielding under tho most favorable circumstances a gross uroduot worth SI,OOO per acre-enough to buy a quarter scuilou of superior wheat luuu west of tno Mississippi. In tno Itmnuillatu vicinity of Now Vork City tho product of mar kotgnrdoulng swells to luilllous of dollars. Ton years ago. the census reported muro than $1,000,000 worth In Queens County alone, and the present enumeration must, when tabulated, show au Immense Inumiso for this suburban district. Tbo neighborhood of lioston and Phil adoiohla and o -cry Other largo city Is monopo lized by market gardens, end too country about Norfolk. Vu.« is mainly devoted to fruit and vegetables tor Northern consumption. Tho fruits of this country, a perishable commodity, must be produced us near as possible to tbo points of principal consumption. Tho domestic fruits alimo furnish a trudo of largo volume and value. Now Vork City Inis a trade in domestic trollsbf more than |U,000,000; Chicago, which supplies the grout Northwest, has about ns much; and the other large cities of tho country would swell tbo total amount to about $00,000,000. Could all tbo fruits sold In smaller cities and villages bo added and those consumed on farms and village lots bo enumerated, tt Is probable. Judging by careful deductions from available data, (hut THE 

ANNUAL. VALUE OP THE FIIUIYB OP THE UNITED STATES would not fall much below $^00,000,000. Thus tho distribution of farm products Is found to arise from u multlpllelty of causes— soil, ollimUu, nourtiOHS to largo cities, prices of land and labor, facility fur obtaining labor at re quired times or seasons, skill In special Indus tries developed by long practice, conservative persistence m time-honored usage, and many other causes servo to distribute lu patches, largo or small, the crops which furnish the products ol American agriculture. Tho great cereal crop of tbo country, Indian corn, Is only exceeded uy grosses hi universality of distribution, constitutes more than 1,71W,0UU.- UK)of tbo 2,700,000,000 bushels of grainofiwu. It is found In every mate, and lu every Territory with one or two exceptions. Vet this crop cannot oscapo tho law ol special local attraction. Thu throe States Illinois, lowa, and Missouri yield 800,000,000 bushels, or 45 pur cunt of (bo crop, and only seven Slates, Including Indiana and Ohio on the East and Kansas and Nebraska on tbo West, over have uny.eonsldorablo surplus above tho ruqiilremonls or boicooonHumpunii. Tbo remaining tbirty-ono States and all the Territories produce together but ,17 per cunt of tho crop at only thoratu of nlntuun bushels por aero, but half (ho rate of yield of tho corn belt. THE lIKCICIPTS AT THE SEAIIOAitD CITIES for exportation and consumption, including all all kinds of grain ground and ungruuml, ag gregated au,trJl,4iU bushels In IH7O, and UUMmlMjut bushels In 18HU. Tbo whole Kasturn movement of Western grain, Including shipments to Inte rior points on tbo Atlantic slope, must somewhat exceed 40d.OOD.UK) bushels, not more than one sixth of the total production of un abundant year, and less lhau ( <mu-fourth of tbo lightest crop tho most disastrous season is hkuly to yield. Tbo rotations which are thus established be tween tho agricultural and muuul'uuturhig In terests of our country not only ulfect tho ma terial prosperity of tho farmer, but they pro vide him with that social enjoyment upon which the happiness of un educated people largely depends, and rouses him to that oner guile ucUmi which gives strength to all his powers. Thu isolation of farm-life Incident to sparsely-settled regions la one of tho trials which tbo American Is anxious to avoid. Am) when be loaves tbo outlying farm and secures u homo nearer tbo haunts of men hu places him self within reach of tbo lyeuum and tho library, and easy and convenient Intercourse with his fellow-men. The comforts and adornments of Ida homo are Increased, and funning becomes to him an occupation analogous to those brunches of business which tempt mon away from TUB BONKI.ISESB OF TUB COUXTIIV to tho pteosuies and opportunities ot tbo city* The teiidenoy of our rural population to aban don tbo exhausted tunas and seek lauds nearer a populous market Is by no moans un evidence of agricultural Ueohno. It Indicates-o disposi tion to take advantage of those circumstances which lead to inure active industry aud mure prulltablo labor, it Is the saute spirit or enter prise which bus Induced many farmers to aban don ueneriil agriculture and dovutu themselves U> special .crops. imd bus led tbo casual observer to Infer that tbo cultivation of too soil was being abandoned. 1 have known tho statistical returns uf many evidently tlirlfty and prosper ous running communities to Indlcntu u re duction or ttio products ot tbo tariu, aud to load us to tbo supposition that because tbo ceieals and nnluuil products were diminishing the lands were descried. Rut a moro careful examination has always revealed tho fact that It was a change In ihn Industry alone wlilcrh had takeirplace, and that Imp iho-o crops which had met with com pi’itltiin 1 rom the cheap und fertile lands of tho Wc«t liinl l>*>i-n «üb«tltulod tho products of tho mark'd garden, with all the prollt that gun* with this miHlo oi manipulating tho land. As this system extends, am) manufacturing cities and towns multiply, tho returns of our (arms will be largely Increased, and tho average yield of our land per aero will bo greatly enlarged. It Is TUB INTIMATE RELATION RKTWKE.V AGRI CULTURE AND MANUFACTURES which makes general farming what It Is, and will gradually mnko American farming wbatMt should be.

And it Is tho absence of this relation wbteh prevents that degree of agricultural prosperity at the Houili which wo havo a right to expect from Its soil and climate. The cotton States need variety of crops to mi tho vast unoccupied areas not well suited to tho cotton culture.

It Is almost unknown In the whole mountain system of the Booth, elopes as well ns summits, and broad tablelands of high eleva tion suited only far THE PRODUCTS OF RtOll, TEMPERATE LATI- TUUES, mixed farming, grain-growing, dairying, and orcharding. It is grown mostly on tho alluvial soils of tho groat rivers, tho limestone bolt of Houthwcstcrii Georgia. Central Alabama, and Western Mississippi, in general terms, one tenth of tbo counties yielding cotton produce half of tno crop. Thu largest average yield por aero, according to tho census, discloses the local belts of great est productiveness. According to this test Rio richest cotton laud In tho Slates is on tbo Mis sissippi above und opposlt Vicksburg.

DEPENDENCE OF TUB MANUFACTURER ON AGRICULTURE. llio benefit which the manufacturer derives from his free ami intlmuto relations with the agriculture of tho country cannot be over looked. On tho one hand drawing his raw ma terials largely from tho immense und various resources of our country—lron, cuttle, wool, hides—and on tho other bond ilndlngu homo market in tho groat agricultural regions, tho American mamifucturor possesses opportune tics und advantages hardly known to any other country on earth, and Illustrating most forcibly the self-supimriing power of our oeoplo. Bo olosoly are muse Interests united that what nf louts one, naturally affects both. Tho same policy which has been extended over our mills has been extended also over our Helds, and tho results in both cases demonstrate its apparent clfoct. While the American manufacturer has furnished tho American funner with almost bis ncuoftary ar ticles, snub as cotton goods und fabrics, boots and shoes, axes, forks, spndes, shovels, hoes, burrows, plows, rakes, cultivators, reapers, mow ers, wagons, tinware, glassware, cheaper than they cun bo purchased in tbo English market, tho American farmer has furnished his products— wool, cotton, provisions, grain—at rates estab lished by our own supply and demand, and nut In uccordHticu with rates llxcd abroad. The trnillu Is freo und equal, and It Is between parties enjoying cnuul privileges and opportunities, rules ot Interest, W'AOKS OF LAtiOR, taxes, social and civil expenses—all being regu lated by one system, and varying only with dif ferent localities. As tho two grout pillars of American industry, they have received equal consideration from the Government. Not only Is a duty laid on goods of foreign manufacture, butihorolsnlso laid on nil animals, except for breeding purposes, u duty of au per cent; on wool, from Id to Id cents pur pound, and from Id to Id per cent ad valorem added; on sugar, from two to live cents per pound; on corn. Id cents per bushel; on barley, J 5 cents; ou wheat, dd cents; on oats, 10 cents: on butter and cheese, 4 cents per pound; ou tobacco loaf, unmanu factured, !(.'»cunts per pound, Aud the American funner'may well rcinemUur that, under this policy tho dip of wool m this cuuutry bus risen from iw.ddd.ooo pounds lu JbUO. to d.’id.ooo.dud pounds lu 1870, and that, In our advancing agri culture we have devoted to wheat fid,l7U square miles; to corn, bd.Uld: to oats, dd.GOOj to barley, d,Bld; to hay, 4d,08d. Tbo corn aud wheat alone covering a larger urea that tbo United Kingdom of Great Drltaln and Ireland. Wiion tbeso two great industries unite in tbo work of developing American resources, ft Is not to ho supposed that they who laid tbe foundation of this Union anticipated tho great and radical change which has taken place since their day.

They could not have listened mnldat tho quiet repose of their luxuriant farms for tbo busy bum of great cities. Lint they performed their work well lu their day and generation, and they set an example of industry and foresight which we may well follow. And Imu compelled tobelluvo Unit they anticipated tbo timuwbon tbo people of this country would bo engaged lu mutual Industries for mutual support, and when .tbo 12,u0u,0u0 of people of their day would bo wline tho W.UOI),000 of our own. busy and con suming In tbe great commercial and manufact uring centres, busy and producing in tbo great agricultural regions, each industry loaulug on Us fellow, uud all united In establishing Ameri can supply for American markets, and regulat ing prices In aecordimco with tbo wants of American labor and (bo value of uctlvu Ameri can capital. Tim TitANsronr.vnoN ixdusthv, Tho production of supplies and tho existence at a market have always crested a necessity fur a system of transportation which constitutes ono of tho corporative Industries of society. Tbu modern methods of transportation by steam, both on laud and water, have given now value inlands, new opportunities to mills, new markets and values to crops: and it may bo sufolv said that tho addition or n powerful and rapid means of transportation has not only given now life to all tho old Industries, but has added a new ono of inestimable value and im portance. Thu labor ami expensuuf exchanging commodities buvu been so far diminished In our day that over/ producing Industry is now able to employ its time and means to tho best possible advantage. No lime Is now wasted by the manufacturer In traveling from bis mill to his market, nouo by tho farmer In transterriog his crops from his Holds to tho consumer. No limit Is now put to tho capacity of the mill, tho capital absorbed, and the bauds employed by distance ami obstacles ou son or land. The farmer whoso lime, ami men, and burses were fully employed lu Imulmg tliu crops of a hun dred acres to market lit ty years ago can now now employ bis force In Increuslug the crop ten times that area of land while It is harvested and oorue to market by machinery. Lunds which were once useless to the cultivator uro now brought by rail to tho very door of the mar ket required by their crops, und not only only Is mu transporting eupaulty of each Indl vldul Increased, hut the force which can bo re tained for work on the land Is vastly en hanced,us well us tho profit on the crop Itself. When, many years ago, tho railroad from Bpnugfluld, 111., to the Illinois Ulvcr wus opened It wus announced In a leading newspaper of that day: "Ono week before tbu railroad was llnlshud corn could be hud here in uny quantity at 15 cents u bushel: now not a bushel can he bad tgr less than ~T» cents.” With the system of funning which 1 (mvodullncd, ami tho system of trans portation which wu possess, tho producing power of American labor and Umi Is almost uulttuluid.
