Dec. 2.—President Wilson's "readjustment" message to congress today is his answer to crit ics of his peace trip and post-war economic plans.

It is now my duty to play my full part in making good what they offered their life's blood to obtain. I can think of no call to service which could transcend this. Will Know All He Does. I shall be in close touch with you and with affairs on this side Of the water and you will know all that I do. At my request the French and English governments have absolutely removed the censorship of caDle news which until within a fortnight they had main tained and there is now no censorship whatever exercised at this end except npon attempted" trade communications with enemy countries. It has been necessary to keep an open wire "con* stantly available between Paris and the department of state and another between France and the department of war. In order that this might toe done -with the least possible interfer ence with the other uses of the cables, I have temporarily taken over the control of both cables in order that they may be used as a single system. I did so at the advice of the most ex perienced cable officials and 1 hope that the results will Justify my hope that the news of the next few months may pass with the utmost freedom and with the least possible delay from each side of the sea to the other. May I not hope, gentlemen of the congress, that in the delicate tasks I shall have to perform on the other side of the sea in my efforts truly $10. —The board of directors of the Red Cross will meet Tuesday afternoon at and faithfully to interpret the princi 4 o'clock at the Industrial association pies and purposes of the country we rooms for an important meeting.

Wetherall, a [difficult duty and responsibilities. I am complete measures were fcnown be|ng that it was longer than usual. Since the position the president outlines now will serve as an index for his domestic policies during the remainder of his term, too great em phasis cannot be placed upon the importance of today's message. Upon the reaction to it, both from the two parties in congress and from the people themselves, is expected to depend President Wilson's attitude towards politics In general in 1920 Krr and his own possible candidacy for the third term in particular. The message, therefore, has been prepared with the most elaborate care and thought, not only for the present, but for the future. Unless all signs fail, it will be the president's idea of what should be the issue tn 1920. Added zest was given the presi dent's appearance before congress to day by persistence of reports that some one or two representatives might attempt to heckle him during his address. While administration leaders were inclined to smile at this and mar jorlty congress leaders laughed it off as a joke, the report heightened the expectations of the galleries, which were crowded early. Those who said they might Inter rogate the president—they wouldn't let their names be used—would have three courses to follow In the pro ceedings. They might simply Inter rupt the president vrtiile he was speaking, considered highly improb able or they might wait until he fin ished and then propose the instruc tions, also considered highly improb able, because the president upon con cluding his address always leaves the chamber hurriedly. The orderly way for any represen tative to proceed is that laid down by the house rules. He would rise as the president was leading his message, addressing the speaker. The speaker would ask the representative why he thus broke Into the proceedings. The representa tive would reply that he wished to ask the president a question. The speaker would then rule on the point and probably squelch the bouse member with a loud bang of bis gavel. It is not believed likely that any, member would undergo the ordeal of such a maneuver. Today the president Is disposing of much work. He 1b not expected to leave for his port of departure until tomorrow, and hence probaWy will meet with his cabinet for the last time tomorrow afternoon. This program may of course be changed later. Tonight he expects to confer with Henry P. Davison, chairman of the American Red Cross,! relative to plans of that organization! for the future. It is said that Davi son wishes to be relieved of his post as soon as posible in order to return to his' peace time associations with J. P. Morgan & Co. There is no in dication there will be any change immediately, however. Meantime, President Wilson is be ing literally flooded with letters and telegrams from representatives of small new nations of Europe's "war babies." All seek his sponsorship at the peace table. Recent days have developed sudden and widespread urge for his labor in behalf of a free Ireland. Whatever may be the presi dent's views on this subject—and it is said by his friends that he favorB home rule for Ireland—the president will not likely express himself at least before the peace table sessions. The question of representation of certain nations at the peace confer ence will be taken up in preliminary discussions of President Wilson and the allied spokesmen when they meet lib France two weeks hence. Neutrals are asking a voice in the conference. Russia, too, must be considered. These factors figure par ticularly in the proposed formation of a league of nations. Prince Lvoff, now in the United States, has been mentioned as the most likely spokesman for Russia at the conclave. 8ome Republicans Laughed. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—Declaring that present governmental agencies jean handle the routine problems of readjustment. President Wilson today isaid the chief need of the country j'ls development of its railways, water 'ways, highways and country roads. The old system of handling rail iways, he said, brought "conditions of restraint without development." Some "new element of policy" Is absolutely necessary, he declared, for the public service, release of credit and protec tion of stockholders. I "I frankly turn to you for counsel," he Bald, at which republicans in the joint congress session hearing him, laughed. I The president declared he believed I the final peace would be completed jby spring. I Meantime, he said, the American man with his "quick initia tive" is goiiig ahead with his read justment. I As for any definite concrete scheme iof "reconstruction," he added, none jhas emerged as yet which he be lieved would work better than pres ent constituted government agencies. Displeasure Breaks Out. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2.—Congres sional displeasure because President Wilson had not yet taken the legis lative branch into his confidence re garding peace matters, broke out to day with convening of the last session of the sixty-fifth congress. Senator Cummins introduced a resolution to create a senatorial committee of eight to "observe" the peace nego­| tiations and keep the senate which has treaty ratification powers, in touch with developments. Representative Rodenburg intro duced a resolution to declare Vice President. Marshal the legal holder of the presidential chair while President Wilson is in Europe.
