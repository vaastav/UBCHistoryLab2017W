The watchman went into the picker room about 10 o'clock and hung his lighted lantern in the place he usually huug it, aud went out.

WASHINGTON LETTER. special correspondence of the monitor. Washington, Dec. 14th. Washington has been favored dur ing the week with a trio of congress es. They were the forty-ninth, the workman: an's congress, and the sanitary congress. The first did little more than organize, read the president's message, and talk about revising its rules. The second dis cussed the laborer's wants, voiced his demands for justice from every standpoint, ordered that the eight hour rule be enforced on May day, and held a parade and mass meeting. The meetings of the health associa tion were of universal interest. A large number of important topics were discussed by eminent physir cifins from every section of the Un ion. There is no subject in which the people are more interested than that of sanitary science, and the cause seems to have fallen into zeal ous and able hands. Speaking of the rules of the house of representatives, that body does not p vi .- in iiifpinot any work un- ,v-x, I. j til some change of rules has been j settled upon. Nor will Speaker j Carlisle announce the standing com mittees until the matter is decided. , The house is too large a body to work rapidly, and the present rules afford every facility for confusion and killing time. Including eight delegates from the territories, the house consists of three hundred and thirty-three members, and most of them think it their duty to make a speech on every possible occasion. The senate, too, likes to hear it self talk. There id Senator Morgan for instance, the orator from Ala bama, who never knows when to shut off his eloquence when it has once started, l nave otten seen him clear the galleries and floor of the senate chamber, and recite his eloquent periods, in finished diction, to the presiding officer, with proba bly a lone senator here and there who dozed on a sofa in the corner, or at his desk pored over a newspaper. Strangers in the galleries are as tonished often at the disrespect shown to each other by senators ab senting themselves while speeches are in progress. The long winded orators are those who lack attention, however. If they had the eloquence of angels they could not hold the ears of the senate if they insisted on talking often or long at a time. The richest man in the house of representatives this session is Mr. Scott, a democrat from Erie, Pa. He is a coal king, and is said to be worth $12,000,000. In his boyhood he served iu the house as a page while Henry Clay was still in the senate. - The richest man in the senate is Stanford, the junior senator from California, whose wealth is estimat ed at $40,000,000. Senator Stanford is a great railroad builder, and a public benefactor, as shown by his recent gift of $15,000,000 to the California university. Before he came to the senate, Senator Fair, of Nevada was the wealthiest senator. Nearly the entire far west is now represented in the senate by million aires. It is a matter of notoriety that some of the seats were bought with money. lu department circles mere is much satisfaction just now. The disbursing officers have consulted together, and have decided not to pay off die day before Christmas this year, mere win be tne usual nau month pay day this week, and then there will be no further payment of salaries until the end of the month The reason is, that if they were paid off for Christmas there would be an advance to each employe of the pay for seven or eight days. If any of the clerks should die or any other contingency arise to make the money not due them, the disbursing clerks would be held responsible, and would have to reimburse the treasury These officers think there is to much risk iu paying out money before it is earned. An interesting auction sale will take place to-morrow at the post office department. It will consist of a year's accumulation of articles in the dead letter office. The sale usually takes place in Washington just before the holidays. At it can be bought almost acything from a toad or snake in alcohol to a pair of bracelets or lace collar, which shows the unlawful use that is made of Uncle Sam's mails. The letters that go astray, and are lost at the dead letter office are burned if they con tain sentiment only, but packages and letters containing valuables are kept and in due time the janitor classifies them, and they are put up at auction. There has been an encouraging increase in the number of Grand Army posts in in this state the past year, there now be ing niuety-two. Several petitions for charters are now in the hanl of Depart ment Commander Greenleuf for consider ation. Collector Smalley recently weut to Montreal for the purpose of looking into the small-pox quarantine business and as a result the mails coming from Montreal are to be fumigated at this place. A building for this purpose is to be put up near the depot. The annual winter meeting of the Vt. Dairyman's Association will be held at Bellows Falls, Jan. 19th, 20th and 21st. A good time is expected. Brother farm ers, make your plans to come, and come to talk as well as hear. Topics and sug gestions thankfully received by O. M. Tiukham, Secretary, X. Pomfret. Two severe accidents happened at the mill at Mclndoes Falls the other day. George Ramsey, while helping shift cars, fell and had the shoulder-blade broken and the arm-bone partially dislocated. Frank Avery had his mitten caught iu a planer so that it drew the hand into the gear. He was obliged to have a part of the hand amputated. The new tariff contract of the Vermont Central railroad with the Grand Trunk railway virtually creates a consolidated line from Bellows and White Eiver Junc tion to Detroit, Mich., and Chicago, 111. The agreement covers a period of 30 yeai's, with possible revision every five years. Each company is bound to con sult the others as to through fares, freight, trains, and business in general. Neither company is to enter into any ar rangement with other competing compa nies for the interchange of trafllc, except by mutual consent. The fact that the Grand Trunk has received one-half of the capital stock of the Central Vermont, 4570 shares, makes it certain that the lat ter road is iu complete union with the Canadian road, and that all the talk of consolidating the Central Vermont with the Lowell or the Fitchburg railroads has no real basis. An unusually large lumber business will be transacted on the upper waters 1 cf the Connecticut this season Among the big lumps will be the VanDyke, 20, 000,000; the Connecticut Eiver Lumber Co., 30,000,000; Geo. Eaton, 4,000,000; the Nnlhegan Lumber Company, 10,000, 000; T. G. Beattie, 1,000,000; Capt. A. M. Beattie, 5,000,000. In all over 75,000,- 000 of lumber will be cut and sent down the river during the ensuing season. About C0,000,000 of this amount will be floated down the river in logs. T, G. Beattie, iu addition to the million manu factured, sells to the down country com panies 6,000,000 which is included in the above estimate.
