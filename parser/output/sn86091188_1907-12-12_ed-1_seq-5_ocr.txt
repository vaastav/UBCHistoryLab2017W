I«! PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE CAUSES OF THE PRESENT FINAN CIAL CONDITIONS IS MADE THE CHIEF TOPIC. SUGGESTS REMEDIES FOR ILLS CONTROL OF CORPORATIONS AND RAILROADS TO PREVENT OVERCAPITALIZATION. Believes This Would 8olve the Prob lem Together with Provision for More Elastic Currency—Recom mends Postal Banks and Asks for Legislation Along Many Lines. Washington, Dec. 3. — President soosevelt's annual message to congress voluminous document of nearly 

'W.OUO words, by far the longest mes age he has ever submitted to congress, opening subject of the message is financial condition of the country, nd for which the president lays much t the blame upon unscrupulous stock eculators, arul says: In any large body of men, however, ere are certain to be some who are .-honest, and if the conditions are ell that these men prosper or com i their misdeeds with impunity, their impie is a very evil thing for the rnmunity. Where these men are busi - men of great sagacity and of tem rament both unscrupulous and reck ss, and where the conditions are such lit they act without supervision or ntrol and at first without effective , k from public opinion, they delude any innocent people into making in -tments or embarking in kinds of tslness that are really unsound, 'hen the misdeeds of these successful dishonest men are discovered, suf mg comes not only upon them, but un the innocent men whom they ve misled. It is a painful awakening. It.never It occurs; and, naturally, n it does occur those who suffer apt to forget that the longer it was i red the more painful It would be. he effort to punish the guilty it Is wise and proper to endeavor so as possible to minimize the dis ss of those who have been misled by gnilty. Yet it is not possible to rain because of such distress from ving to put an end to the misdeeds t are the ultimate causes of the suf ing and, as a means to this end, ere possible to punish those re nsible for them, There may be hon diff. rences of opinion as to many rernmental policies; but surely there be no such differences as to the \ d of unflinching perseverance in the r against successful dishonesty." quotes at length from his mes of last year in which he advo federal control of- corporations ; interstate business, and believes t in such control would be found the edy for overcapitalization and speculation which he believes brought about the present flnan conditions. He says: steady aim should be by legis on. cautiously and carefully under -?n, but resolutely persevered In, to .rt the sovereignty of the national eminent by affirmative action. 'his is only in form an innovation, ubstance it Is merely a restoration; [from the earliest time such regula of industrial activities has been gnlzed in the action of the taw ing bodies; and all that I propose meet the changed conditions In manner as will prevent the com ealth abdicating the power It has ys possessed, not only In this coun but also in England before and this country became a separate ral Control of wails Is Favored. r small part of the trouble that we conies from carrying to an ex e the national virtue of self-re e, of independence in Initiative ction.

It should be so amended a8 ^. t0 u f °. rbld onIy the kind of combination which does harm to the general public, such amendment to be accompanied by or to be an Incident of, a grant of su pervisory power to the government over these big corporations engage«* in inter state business. This should be accom panied by provision for the compulsory publication of accounts and the subjec tion of books and papers tc the inspec tion of the government officials. A be ginning has already been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. "The antitrust law should not prohibit combinations that do no injustice to the public, still less those the existence of which is on the whole of benefit to the public. But even if this feature of the law were abolished, there would remain as an equally objectionable feature the difficulty and delay now incident to its enforcement. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delays before obtaining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to control these corporations by lawsuits means to impose upon both the depart ment of justice and the courts an im possible burden; it Is not feasible to carry on more than a limited number ot such suits. Such a law to be really effective must of course be administered by an executive body, and not merely by means of lawsuits. The design should be to prevent the abuses incident to the crea tion of unhealthy and improper combina tions, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to de stroy them by civil or criminal proceed ings. Investing; Public Should Be Amply Safeguarded. "The congress has the power to charter corporations to engage in interstate and foreign commerce, and a general law can be enacted under the provisions of which existing corporations could take out fed eral charters and new federal corpora tions could be created. An essential pro vision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter vas an association or combination within the restrictions of the federal law*. Provision should also bo made for complete publicity in all matters affecting the public and complete protec tion to the investing public and the share holders in the matter of issuing corporate securities. If an incorporation law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big interstate corporations might be enacted; or a combination of the two might be tried. The supervision established might be analogous to that now exercised over national banks. At least, the antitrust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions of the methods which ex perience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic combina tions to crush out competition. The real owners of a corporation should be com pelled to do business in their own name. The right to hold stock ln other corpora tions should heareafter be denied to inter state corporations, unless on approval by the proper government otfioiahs, and ii prerequisite to such approval should be the listing with the government of all owners and stockholders, both by the corporation owning such stock and by the corporations in which such stock is owned. "To confer upon the national govern ment, in connection with the amendment I advocate in the antitrust law, power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate commerce, would benefit them as it has benefited the na tional banks. In the recent business crisis It is noteworthy that the institu tions which failed were institutions which were not under the supervision and control of the national government. Those which were under national con trol stood the test. "National control of the kind above ad vocated would be to the benefit of every well-managed railway. From the stand point of the public there is need for ad ditional tracks, aditlonal terminals, and improvements in the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as possible. Ample, safe, and speedy trans portation facilities are even more neces sary than cheap transportation. There fore, there is need for the investment of money which will provide for all these things while at the same time securing as fas as is possible better wag»-s and shorter hours for their emplo 3 'es. There fore, w'hile there must be Just and rea sonable regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest against any arbitrary and unthinKing movement to cut them down without the fullest and most care ful consideration of all Interests con cerned and of the actual needs of the situation. Only a special body of men acting for the national government un der authority conferred upon It by the congress is competent to pass Judgment on such a matter. Greater Klaut Icily Id C urrency Ih I rgeit. The president quotes extensively from his last message in dealing with the di rect subject of currency legislation, and says; "I again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity in our cur rency; provided, of course, that we recog nise the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the na tional authorities. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emergency issue should, of course, be made with an effective guaranty, and up on conditions carefully prescribed by the i government. Such emergency issue must be based on adequate securities approved by the government, and must be issued under a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the demand for it was urgent, while securing its re tirement as the demand fell off. It ls worth investigating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should be sub ject to the same supervision as banks, legislation to this effect should be en acted for the District of Columbia and the territories. "Vet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No legislation can by any possibility guar antee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than it can guarantee an Individual against the results of his extravagance. When an In dividual mortgager his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster; and when wealthy men. or men who pose as such or »re unzcropuluuRly or fool! »hl y pu*« X« become mi.h ;a«lulx C t n reck le», »poo u »tlon-p.pecially If 1 « is accompanied by dlzhonw.y—they joupardlre not only their own future but the future of all their in noeent fellow-dtlstlia fur the whole buslne and distrvHs.'* they expose rnmunity to panic tire life He advtsL . _ Insulation this says; any aga.nsr any general tariff i " »su.n of congress, and j "In country of -M». f s»uch phenomenal growth as ours It is pruhlbly well that etery dosen years or »u the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no excessive or Improper bene are conferred thereby, that proper provided, and that our trade is encouraged. There ways be aa a minimum i * » which will not only al low' for the collection of an ample rev , but *1U at least make good the difference in cost of production here and abroad, that is, the difference in co * t here * nd abroad, for the well-being of the wage-worker must ever c a cardinal point of American policy. The question should be approached pure ly from a business standpoint; both the time and the manner of the change being auch a8 to arouse the minimum of agi atlon and disturbance in the business an<1 to K,ve the leaBt b* a >' for selfish and factional motives. The sole consideration should be to see that the sum total of changes represent the pub die good This means that the subject cannot with wisdom be dealt with in the year preceding a presidential election, be cause as a matter of fact experience has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to tn ;it it from the standpoint of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately after such elec tion." He asks for the repeal of the tariff on Paper and wood pulp. He reviews and enlarges upon his pre vious recommendations for the enact ment of federal inheritance and Income tax laws. Attention is calltMi to the prosecution of wealthy offenders against the national laws, and in this connection he asks that the laws under which these prosecutions are brought be strengthened and made more definite. A few years ago there was loud com plaint that the law could not be invoked against wealthy offenders. There is no such complaint now. The course of the department of Justice during the last few years has been such as to make It evident that no man stands above the law. that no corporation is so wealthy that it cannot be held to account. The department of justice has been as prompt tc proceed against the wealthiest malefactor whose crime was one of greet! arid running as to proceed against the agitator who incites to brutal violence. Everything that can be done under the existing law. and with the existing state of public opinion, which so profoundly influences both the courts and juries, has been done. But the laws themselves need strengthening In more than one Impor tant point; they should be made more definite, so that no honest man can be led unwittingly to break them, and so nhat the real wrongdoer can be readily punished. Moreover, there must be the public opinion back of the laws or the laws themselves will be of no avail. At pres ent. while the average juryman undoubt edly wishes to see trusts broken up, and is quite ready to fine the corporation itself, he is very reluctant to nnd the facts proven beyond a reasonable doubt when it comes to sending to Jail a mem ber of th% business community for in dulging in practices which are profound ly unhealthy, but which, unfortunately, the business community has grown to recognize as well-nigh normal. Both the present condition of the law and the present temper of Juries render it a task of extreme difficulty to get at the real wrongdoer In any case, especially by Im prisonment. Yet It is from every stand point far preferable to punish the prime offender by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation, with the attendant damage to stockholders. The two great evils in the execution of our criminal laws to-day are sentimen tality and technicality. For the latter the remedy must come from the hands of the legislatures, the courts and the laywers. The other must depend for Its cure upon the gradual growth of a sound public opinion which shall Insist that re gard for the law and the demands of reason shall control all other influences and emotions in the jury box. Both of these evils must be removed or public discontent with the criminal law will con tinue. revenue foreign must tariff The Use and the Abuse ot lojunctiona. "Instances of abuse in the granting of injunctions in labor disputes continue to occur, and the resentment in tiie minds of those who feel that their rights are being Invaded and their liberty of action and of speech unwarrantably restrained continues to grow. Much of the attack on the use of the process of Injunction is wholly without warrant; but I am con strained to express the belief that for some of it there ls warrant. This ques tion is becoming more and more of prime importance, and unless the courts will themselves deal with It ins effective man ner, It is certain ultimately to demand some form of legislative action. It would • be most unfortunate for our social wel j far* If we should permit many honest and law-abiding citizens to feel that they had just cause for regarding our ! courts with hostility. I earnestly com mend to the attention of the congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of in junctions and protect those rights which I from time to time it unwarrantably in vades. Moreover, discontent is often ex 1 pressed with the use of the process of injunction by the courts, not only in la I hor disputes, but where state laws are concerned. I refrain from discussion of this question as I am informed that it will soon receive the consideration of the j supreme court." I Of other legislation in the interest of labor he favors federal inspection of rail roads; providing limited but definite com pensation for accidents to all workmen employed In any way by the government, ! and says: "The constitutionality of the employers* j liability act passed by the preceding con gress has been carried before the courts. In two Jurisdictions the law has been de^ I dared unconstitutional, and In three juris dictions its constitutionality h»« been af firmed. The quesilon has been carried to ( t*»e supreme court, the case has been heard by that tribunal, and a decision is expected at an early date. In the event that thw court should affirm the consti tutionality of the act. I urge further bg j islation along the line* advocated in my : message to the preceding congress The practice of putting the entire burden of loss of life or limb upon the victim or tue victim's family is a form of scad a I In justice In which the United States stands in unenviable prominence. In both our federal and our state legislation we have, with few exceptions. s arcely gone farther than the repeal of the f#dlow servant principle of the old law of liabil ity, and in some of our states even this slight modification of a complete out grown principle has not yet been se cured." He favors the extension of the eight hour law to all departments of the gov ernment. and to all work carried on by , the government. He urges legislation for the compulsory investigation of in dustrial disputes, and says; "The need for some provision for such investigation was forcibly illustrated ; during the past summer A strike of 1 telegraph operators seriously interfered but was to the of the the the enact- J for of In it as j !

Appeals were made to me from many pan* of the country. fn,m ; council*. from hoards of trade chambers of commerce, and from * organizations, urging that step. city labor organization*, urging that steps be taken to terminate the »trike. Everything that could with any pro priety be done by a representative of the government was done without avail, and for week* the public stood by and suffered without recourse of any kind. Had the machinery existed and had there been authority for compulsory investigation of the dispute, the public would have been placed In posseaalon of the merits of the coa'roverey. and public opinion brought about ] "It is Idle to laws « vils sud over-working to protect can be ouUI probably have opt adjustment, iltl that without good s child labor, a» the women, as the fall iploywi from loss of more stock-wat good laws tices by ffeetively reached j f»an the evils of relates and j ing cau t»e reached w ithout j Tp fail to »top these pmc- ! gislation meant to force* honest men Into them, because other wise the dishnnetti who surely will take advantage of them will have* everything their own way. If the states correct the«*- evils, well and good; the nation must stand ready to aid them. When the department of agriculture founded there was much sneering as its usefulness. No department of the government, however, has more em phatically vindicated its usefulness, and none save the post office department comes so continually and intimately Into touch with the people. The two citlsena whose welfare Is ln the aggregate most vital to the welfare of the nation, and therefore to the welfare of all other citi zens. are the wag* worker who does manual labor and the tiller of the soil, farmer There are, of course, kinds labor where the work must be purely mental, and there are other kind* of labor where, under existing conditions, very little demand indeed is made upon mind, though l am glad to say that proportion of men engaged in this kind of work is diminishing. But In any community with the solid, healthy quali ties which make up h really great nation bulk of the people should do work which calls for the exercise of both body and mind. Progress can nut permanently exist in the abandonment of physical )alH»r, but in the development of physical labor, so that it shall represent more and more the work of the trained mind in the trained body. Our school systenf is gravely defective in so far as it it puts u premium upon piers literary training and tends therefore to train the boy away from the farm and the workshop. Noth is more needed than the best type of industrial school, the school for me chanical industries In the city, the school practically tea* hing agriculture In the country. The calling of the skUlod tiller the soil, the calling of the skilled me chanic, should alik* be recognized as professions, Just as emphatically ns the callings of lawyer, doctor, merchant, or clerk. The schools should recognize this fact und it should be equally recognised popular opinion. The young man who has the farsighted m ss and courage to recognise it nnd get over the idea that makes a difference whether what he earns is «'ailed salary or wages, ami who refuses to enter the crowded field of the so-called professions, and takes to con structive industry Instead, is reasonably sure of an ample reward in earnings. In health. In opportunity to marry early, and to establish a home with a fair amount of freedom from worry. It should be one of our prime »objects to put both the farmer and the mechanic on a higher plane of efficiency and reward, so to increase their effectiveness ln the economic world, and therefore the dlg nliy, the remuneration, and the power of their positions in the social world. Inland Waterway Systems Should ne Deevlnped. "The conservation of our national re sources and their proper use constitute the fundamental problem which under lies almost every other problem of our national life. We must maintain for our civilization the adequate material basis without which that civilization cannot exist. We must show foresight, w«* must look ahead. As a nation we not only enjoy a w«>nderful measure of present prosperity but if this prosper lty is used aright it is an earnest of future success such as no other nation will have. The reward of foresight fot this nation is great and easily foretold But there must be the look ahead, there must be a realization of th«* fact that to waste, to destroy, our natural resources, to skin and exhaust the land Instead of using it so as to increase its usefulness, will result ln undermining in the days of our children the very prosperity which we ought by right to hand down to them amplified and devel oped. For the last few years, through several agencies, the government has been endeavoring to get our peopl look ahead and to substitute a planned and orderly development of our re sources in place of a haphazard striv ing for immediate profit. Our great river systems should be developed ai national water highways; the Missis slppi, with its tributaries, standing first in importance, and the Columbia sec ond. although there are many others of importance on the Pacific and Atlantic and the gulf slopes. The national gov ernment should undertake this work, and I hope a beginning will be mad In the present congress; and the great est of all our rivers, the Mississippi should receive especial attention. From the Great Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi there should be a deep wa terway. with deep waterways leading from It to the east and the west. Such a waterway would practically mea the extension of our coast lint* into the very heart of our country. It would be of incalculable benfefit to jr people »rrie.l through bppun Ht once it fan be in time appreciably to Kestlnn of our (treat freight-oarrylnx Knee of railroad».

In the same connection he a»k« for a revision of the public land law» atonic the lines proposed by the public land» commission. Uelteve» the government «hould Increase It» efTorte to conserve our forest* and «hould in creaae by purchase the existing forent preserve». On the subject of the natural resources of' the •.tion he «ays: "In the eastern United Ktate* the min. ral fuels have already passed Into the hand« of large private owner», and those of the went are rapidly following It is obvious that these fuels should he conserved nnd not wasted, and It would be w. II to protect th> people against unjust and extortionate prices so far as that can still be done. What has been accomplished In the great oil fields of the Indian Territory by the action of the administration offers a rlrlking example of the good results of such a policy In my Judgment the government should have the right to keep the fee of the coal oil and gas fields in its own possession snd to lease the rights to develop them under proper regulation«; or else. If the con gre»» will not adopt this method, the coal deposits should be sold under llm italiens, to conserve them as public utilities, the right to mine coal being separated from the title to the soil The regulations should permit coal land* to be work-d In sufficient quan tity by the several corporations The present limitation« have been absurd excessive, and serve no useful purpose and often render It necessary that there should be either fraud or else abandonment of the work of getting out the coal."
