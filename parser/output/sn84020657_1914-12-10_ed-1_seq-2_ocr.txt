ALASKA DAILY EMPIRE Published by ~Uie KM PI HE PRINTING COMPANY SUBSCRIPTION RATES: One year, by mail 310.00 Six months, by mail 5.00 Per month, delivered ? ? 1.00 Entered as second-class matter November 7. 1912. at the postofllce at Ju aeau, Alaska, under the Act of March 3. 1879: KEEPING FAITH WITH ALASKA PRESIDENT WILSON and his cabinet are demonstrating that Alaska is not to be overlooked, even though there are many serious problems confronting the nation brought! about by conditions obtaining in foreign lands. The Na tional platform pledges regarding Alaska are to be redeemed. A few days ago Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane an nounced that he would ask for $5,000,000 for next year's pre liminary construction work on the Alaska government rail road. This is of course a part of the $35,000,000 pledged by the government for such railroad construction. Now comes Secre tary of Commerce W. S. Redfield, asking Congress to vote, hah' a million dollars for-the protection of ocean going commerce inj Alaskan waters, nearly half of which amount to be devoted to a dragwire survey of the channels and a proper charting of the same, the balance in providing new vessels for the geodetic sur vey service. President Wilson, in his message to Congress only two days ago, reiterated the need of more aids to navigation in Alaska waters, stating that "the surveys were woefully incomplete and; that shins and lives had been lost at nearly every point in thread-1 ing th?i courses that were supposed to be well-known channels." Both President Wilson and Secretary Redfield severely crit icised the condition of the vessels now in use by the geodetic survey service, characterizing them as "wholly inadequate and unfit for service, and so nearly unseaworthy that our own in spectors would not have allowed private owners to send them to sea." 

FORCING ALASKA DRY. CONGRESSMAN J. A. FALCONER, of the State of Washing ton, threatens to introduce a bill in Congress at the pres ent session providing for prohibition of the liquor business j :n Alaska. Moreover he also threatens to devote a great deal ' his energy toward securing the passage of the bill.. No doubt Mr. Falconer feels strongly on the subject and is ac uated by very high motives, but would it not seem more polite :'cr him to wait until the people of Alaska have had an oppor anity to express themselves on the subject. Alaska is in no e responsible for the arid conditions obtaining in the State ashington and is not particularly interested in it. But sup osing our Delegate to Congress had the right of initiating a measure laying restrictions on the people of the State of Wash ington, and should proceed to do so, would not the people of the State, including Congressman Falconer find just ground for the criticism of the act? While the people of Alaska are barred from passing any laws affecting the liquor traffic, they have a means of bring ing the desire for such legislation before Congress through their legislative bodies. Moreover, many of the population now in Alaska, have a distinct recollection of the conditions that ob tained in Alaska during the reign of National prohibition in the Territory. And the conditions as existing at that time were not ideal in any respect. THE PETERSBURG WEEKLY REPORT VOLUME one, number one, of the Petersburg Weekly Report, made its debut on December 5. It is one of the brightest and newsiest papers published in Alaska and deserves to succeed. The editor and publisher, Lynn W. Miller, is a news- , paper man of abundant experience, besides having an intimate . knowledge of Alaska, her resources and her people. The people i of Petersburg are to be congratulated in that Mr. Miller decided to: cast hie lot with them. In his foreword which is appended, the ; publisher gives his reason for choosing Petersburg as his field. 1 Mr. Miller says: "It is a time-honored custom in establishing a news paper for the publisher in his initial issue to give rea sons?oft'times more or less apologetic?for his selec tion of the particular community in which he launches his journalistic enterprise. This is usually followed by i a declaration of the paper's policy in matters political and of general interest. The Report is able to meet the j ( first clause of this custom requirement with brevity? i and without apology. The publisher believes Petersburg offers the best field for a weekly newspaper of any place in Alaska, or, in fact in the entire Northwest country. We found it to be the only town in the Northwest of equal popu- t lation, or of half of its commercial importance, unpro- J vided with a news medium. Upon closer inquiry, we as certained the sense of the business men and citizens v generally to be that Petersburg wants a newspaper. c These favorable conditions, together with the fact ! ' that the town has the resources and natural advantages 5i which insure its steady and substantial growth, are the a "reasons" for the Petersburg Weekly Report. "The first purpose of this paper will be to chroni- c cle the news of Petersburg and vicinity, and its policy ! ti to advocate every matter and enterprise advanced tend- ? ing toward the development of Petersburg and this im mediate section of Alaska. "Politically: While the editor is a Republican, in view of the total lack of evidence showing the existence $ of that party as an organization in Alaska during the ? recent campangn, it would approach the Quixotic to announce the paper's intention to support anything so a intangible. The Report will, therefore, be non-parti- bl san, and will endeavor to give fair and full credit to as- Z pirants for and incumbents of local and territoral offic- b ial position, regardless of their political leanings. "In conclusion, we wish to earnestly solicit the co operation of the citizens of Petersburg in our efforts to r< make of the Report a newspaper creditable to a town, ? which in the near future should be classed among the largest and most important cities in Alaska." REPORTSjRICH STRIKE IN THE KUSKOKWIM SEWARD, Nov. 30.?Dr. Green of Tacotnn, in a letter to Frank Cotter, report# tho discovery of a groat pay streak on Candle Crook, a tributary of the Talaiona which flows Into tho Tacotna. He says that Aitkcn and Tom. VcKlnnon, tho owners of the property had a Keystono drill work ing on tho ground all last winter and last summer. Thoy also had a crew of 22 men working in an opon cut at the timber line where tho ground is i only 5 to 7 feet deep. Writing of tho ground, tho doctor ! says: "The paystreak here is 150 j foot wldo and gets Wider aa it good down stream, being 430 foot whore | they quit drilling. Tho drill holes ! show an average of 37 to tho square | foot of bedrock along the left bank : of the paystreak. , Thirty feet from this vein it averages 36 and from that place to the extremo right limit of | the paystreak It gradually tapers off to fifty cents to the square foot of bedrock." ANOTHER MURDER IN BRISTOL BAY VALDEZ, Nov. 27.?On October 13, Sakar Judas shot and killed a native named Wassella about 15 miles above Naknek. and shot and wounded Ban ley Kovlv, also a native, at the same time Tho natives had been drinking natlvo beer and wero all. more or less intoxicated. It seems Wassella had been abus ing the mother of Judas, a boy 12 years of age, and ho secured a gun and shot Wassolla through tho fore head, Just botwoon tho oyes, killing hlin instantly. Kovlk heard the shot and was coming to the fish houso, whero tho shooting occurred, to find out what was tho matter, when Judas fired a shot at him, wounding him In the chin. The last shot was made because the boy was frightened and not because Kovlk or Judas bad had any trouble. Judas has been bound over to tho district oourt charged with murder. MASTODON SKULL TO QO TO EXPOSITION SEATTLE, Doc. 5.?A gigantic mas todon skull, dug from the frozen ground 110 foot bolow the surface, has been brought to Seattle by CapL S. C. Barrlngton, president of the Side stream Navigation Co. of Dawson. The skull and two enormous tusks were dug out of a mine shaft within 30 miles of Dawson by George Nunan, a miner. , Tho ground was frozon from the surface down, and tho miners thawod it out with a wood fire as they dug. They broko off a ploco of the skull before they realized what they were finding. When tho hard point of ono of the tusks appeared thoy dug with extreme care and finally unearthed I two tusks about seven feet loug, a sths:!!. r. numLer of teeth and a huge .oj. Lone. The tusks weigh each more than 150 pounds, and a single tooth weighs 20 pounds. The remains are brown from being burled thousands of years in tho frozen ground, but are well pro served. The teeth are ridgod, and the crowns are as wide as a 3tove lid. H. Crowhurat, 2109 2nd avenue N., has the interesting curios at his home. He will send thom to Son Francisco for exhibition In the Panama-Pacific Exposition. "The country where these relics i were obtained is rich in mastodon re- I mains," said Prof. Trevor Kincald, head of tho University of Washington ! department of biology, today. "In Siberia there have boon found ' skeletons with large parts of frozen flesh still adhering to them. The fro- . zen condition of the ground preserves them iii good condition." I > ? ? ]
