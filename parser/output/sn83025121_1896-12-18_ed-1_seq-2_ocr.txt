TRUSTS AXD MONOPOLIES. "Thoask Coagress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the tews passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not because of aay lack of disposition or attempt to eaforee them, bat simply because the hiws themselves as interpreted by the coarts do not reach the difficulty. If the iasaSeiencies of existing laws can he remedied by farther legislation it shotthi be done. It should be afeed. however, that all financial leg islation oa this subject may fall short of its psrpose because of inherent ob- staades. aad also because of the complex character of oar Government teau which, while making the Federal aathority supreme within its sphere, has earefully limited that sphere by booads which cannot be transgressed.

Cleveland's. ils?as? a Matter of Grave l)l?cnIoa. MADRID, SPAIX, Dec. 9. The Her- alde says: The Cabiaet held a meet ing today for the purpose of consid ering President Cleveland's message to Congress. Ex-Premier Sagasta declared that the message is of so much importance that he will await the receipt of the full text of the document before discussing it. All of the Spanish newspapers declare that the message provokes Eu rope, not Spain alone. The general opinion here is that the references to Cabs, and Spain contained in President Cleveland's message to Congress show that it is the intention of the United tates to conform more and more to the Monroe Doctrine each, time a case arises to whfch that principle is ap plicable. The Cabinet, after debating the text of the message .today will form a defin ite jadgaent. which it is believed will resalt in a modifications of the of Spain with the United States. SATs

A confer ence of the Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee will be held tomorrow night, probably at the rooms of Dingley. the chairman, to decide what action shall be taken with reference to the preparation of a tariff bilL The consideration of this ques tion also involves the necessity of an extra session.
