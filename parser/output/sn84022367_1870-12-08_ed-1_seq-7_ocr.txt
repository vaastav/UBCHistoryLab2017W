MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1870. "-Tlio Bureau I Statlatlca. The chief of tha Bateau of Statistics in his annual report takes occasion to mska some sensible remarks relatiTe to the great importance of immigration to the prosperitj of the country. He suggests that since the termination of ine war the fertile lands of the South, heretofore, un der a system of servile labor but partially cultivated, present extraordinary induce ments for immigration at the present time in the North Western, Southern and Pa ciflc States there exists a demand for com' mon, and to a more limited extent, for skilled labor, never before equalled. With a view of affording to the immi grant such reliable information in regard to the several states aa would enable him to make an intelligent choice of a home, a list of questions was forwarded to the as sessors of Internal Revenue in all the States West and South of Pennsylvania calculated to show the opportunities and advantages offerred to settlers in each section. Replies to these questions have been received and the data classified and compiled, embodying an amount of infor mation, which in fnllness and, accuracy hai not before been attained. These com pilations are now undergoing revision and will in connection with tables show ing the oost of labor in the several States corrected to October 1870, be submit ted to the public in a special report here after. The Bureau of Statistics promises to become one of tho most useful subordinate departments at Washington. The head of the office in required to collect, digest and arrange for the use of Congress -statistics of tho manufactures of the United States, their localities, sources of faw ma terials, markets, exchanges with the pro ducing regions of the country, transpor tation of product!, wages, and suoh other conditions as are found to affect their paosperity. The prevent year this Bu reau will not be us valuable for the statis tics ami Information furnished aa hereof ter In those years of the decade in which the census is not tken. The publication of the census returns of the products of in dustry, given in detail and with approxi juate accuracy, rtipersedea much of the iuf0mition which hereafter it will be the Jiitv oi the department to collect. The subject po.',st'H,e', Kret and increasing im portance, h.,t should noA, be lost sijfht of ; t ut in the succeeding years of this decado the earnest rersistent efforts of tho Bureau should be directed to ob taining and publishingr trustworthy in formation in reimrd to the extent and Condit:ou of our lunnufaoturing industry This depHrtment will grow mire valuable each year, until each State will have or ganized a similar department for its own purposes. Vermont has already com menced in this direction by connect ing the collection of statistics with the Board of Agriculture created by the last Legislature, and its fir.-t rejort, two years hence, if wisely directed, will show statistics of our farms, quarries, mines, water power, railways and their products and transportation, that will sur prise the people and erhance the material prosperity of the State. The Fiiesi dent's Message. From the little that can be learned regarding the tone and matter of the President's Message, tha public may expect a docu ment full of bold aud positive expressions. It will be somewhat longer thxn that of lrtt jenr, and will discuss all the nutters that, have engaged the attention of the Administration for the past year. There M be a recommendation cf notion on the wl1 , question, and a review of what fifherie. nj jQ judUu service, with has been do. , tBtiroation that the civil a pretty broau bo peoplu nm service reform, wi pro8e01jtfl(J. need, is still being acv wUh oharaQ. The Pre-ident will adhere, oQ teristio firmness, to his position "we. jn, quisitiou of a foothold in the . ftor dies ; and on the question of reviving commerce he will reassert the views ex preised lust summer. The Fresideut has piven considerable thought lately to the great evils arising from the growing power of great corporations, and the con centration of vast material interests in the hands ci the few. He may, however, prefer to present this matter to Congress at a later period, wheja his views as to the remedy are more thoroughly defined. Al together, the Meesugo is said to be decid edly affirmative in tone, and it Is con fidently expected that it will stike the publio mind even more favorably than did that jof last year. The Eastern Question. The reply of Prince Gortschakoff to Earl Granville was published on Thursday in St. Peters- burs. The Russian Minister declines to discuss the question of propriety involved involved in his first note. He regrets that Earl Granville takes exception to his form of communication, and says the ab rogation of the entire trea.y was not con templated. The peace of the world re quired that treaty. Russia, however, is willinir to enter into a conference of the Powers. A St. Petersburg dispatch says a paoifio solution is assured. The Vienna heveFreie Preiae says France will partici pate in a conference to be held at London. A dispatoh from Tours, however, says that that branoh of the Government has referred the matter to their collogues in Faris. According to the "Vienna journal above named, the preliminary discussions will iuvolve other questions than those t-otinected with the Treaty of 1S5G. A Berlin telegram says a new treaty will be "oposed, omitting the question of the l' -k Sea neutrality, Blat ... Office Orders.

Indeed, if the instructions are carefully observed no V. can occur to anyone-except pethapB to ihe govern mentwhen this mode of making remit tances is adopted. The charges on money order letters are very slight aud the de livery is always prompt. We think that List the system will be rapidly extended until all principal points in the country are accommodated with money order offices. It is now also in contemplation to make an international arrangament whereby money may be remitted between Eng land and the United States with the same guarantees as those afforded by our domestio money order ' ofaces. This would be of immeBse advantage to the thousands of people who have remittances to make to their friends in Europe, in Ireland especially, and we hope that the -oney order system will be so extended that it will accommodate the great nun ber of our foreign born citizens who wish to send moneys "home." ' Mormon Church Property Tax able. The acting commissioner of In ternal Revenue has decided that the in come from the Mormon Church property, held by Brigham Young aa trustee is tax able; the points raised by Mr. Young, that it consisted of voluntary contribu tions, ana that it was held as common property by more than five persons, and therefore exempt, being overruled. The penalties of excommunication and other punishments for non-payment of tithes werwheld to destroy their character as voluntary contributions. The Collector of Internal Revenue in Utah has been di rected to collect the tax at once, without the penalty which was added for non payment. . The Chinese War Not to be be hind the Europeans, China has got a war upon her hands. The irrepressible Tartar population, who keep up the process rela tively to the Celestial Empire which the Northern barbarians did, for some centu ries, in regard to the Roman, have made another of their chronic insurrections. Between the Western traders, who are creeping up her rivers from the eastern seaboard, and the nomadio races that keep up the infiltration of barbaric ideas of freedom from the west, the venerable and stationary . civilization of the "Flowery Land" has some rude shacks before it in the immediate future. General European News. The vomito has disaappeared from Valencia, Alioaute and Barcelona, in Spain. The passengers, baggage and part of the cargo of the steam ship Union have been saved.

The Prussians ba?e burned the town of Charb ville, because they were fired upon, as they approached, by Frano-Tirenrs. A Berlin dispatch says the proposal to consolidate the issues of the new loan has been accepted. Advices from the interior of France represent tho priests as inciting the peo ple to resist the Prussians as heretics, and as consequence, it U said, Prussian patrols and dinpttch bearers are shot down when none but innocent looking peasants are visibln. - Harper's Weekly Ilarjier'a Weekly was unusually good last week. There are many original illustrations in it of very striking mailt-notably, a double-page one with "War Time in B ivaria aa its subject. It is a drawing of great power and originality, and ought to be preserved among the reonrtls or tbH momentous period t' rough which we are passing.

Summer, once ao voluptuous and beau tiful, has lost her roses and dimples, and now rests faint and languid upon the lap of Autumn ; and the "sear and yellow leaf reminds us of the glories departed, far away iu .the golden past, and, as we ling ering gaze, pale Autumn turns her mournful ryes upon us, in a sad farewell, Li!e bhe silently points to the white girmeuts of her cold-hearted lover, who stands upon the mountain-top, impatient ly wmting for his bride. As nature ields her beauties, one by one, to the Frost King, and we have little left cutatJc, with wtiivti to uliaiui the ejr we turn within to the light and love of our hearths and homes, aad seek protec tion and comfort from those we love. " And if the day we gave to labor, The eve ing'a due to friend and neighbor.' Thus Mr. Editor, our evening enter tainments have commenced, though some what earlier this season than formerly, yet we bil thetu with a hearty welcome. The reunion of old friends and friend ship, the pleasant interchange of thoughts, spiced with music and mirth, around the firesidp, all tend to elevate the soul, and make us wiser and happier.. Our first entertainment came off in the shape of a "surprise party" at the house of Mr. Harrison White, on Monday even ing, Oct. 31st, and although the evening was rather inclement, the good people of our town there assembled to the number of about fifty, the object being to present Miss Julie White with a purse of money for her very acceptable services to us, upon the Sabbath, as organist. This was also her fifteenth anniversary, and we doubt not, that thii unexpected celebrat ing of it will cause her ever to remember it with pleasure. A purse of over twenty dollars was made up for her, Mr. A. E. Stanley very neatly and appropriately making the pre sentation, to whioh she earnestly and feelingly replied in tho following words : " I thank you all, and hope I may prove myself worthy of your t?ift." Tears of gratitude speaking more eloquently than further language could have done, and we felt amply repaid for thus demoustrat ing our appreciation for her labors. - Refreshments were served immediately after, and, judging from the bountiful supply of candies, popped-corn, lucious ice-cream, and fragrant tea, we came to the very unavoidable conclusion that Mr. White and.lady had stolen a march on us, and that we were the surprised ones, after all. Music, both vocal and instrumental, lent its charms throughout the evening, and general good feeling prevailed ; and when we bade good-jnight to our friends we felt happier and better for this, our first entertainment of the season. Leicester. Obituary. A clergyman writes us that Deacon James Muzzey of Jamaica died November 18th, at tho advanced age of 81 years 7 months and IS days. He had been a resident of the town since he was two years old, a devoted christian forty-five years, and a faithful Deacon of the Baptist Church for more than thirty years. "JU.e came aown to nis grave ue shock of corn cometh in its season ; bis work well done on earth and his soul ma tured for heaven." , .. East Potjltnet. We learn that we were mistaken in several of the particu lars relative to the accident at East oultney. The wagon ' shop is being erected near the covered bridge by Messrs. Dewey and Morse, and it was a young man and' not a boy who fell there from. He fell 40 feet striking three times before he finally landed on the stone in the wheel pit. Dr. A. E. Horton and not Dr. Ross was in attendandance within 10 minutes. Mr. E. 8. Dewey, the first to reach him, thought him dead. The young man is now out and is gaining. It was a narrow escape from death. . r " .'- ' c The . Herald. A h gentleman ' is Windsor County in renewing his . sub scription for the Weekly Herald says : "I cannot give Up the

A few dayB since a letter with the following novel in scription passed through the post-office at Brandon : Uncle Bam, you are my Debtor, I gave you three cents to carry this letter, ' If you carry it safe to your destination It will be a big thing for the Administration. If you dont be sure you'll get swore at, And in future I will be a Democrat. ' Chester.
