But that is because he takes an ad vantage and an unfair advantage of his neighbors and town merchants Suppose the buyer is a farmer How much does any mail order house con tribute in the way of taxes toward keeping up the many institutions of any community AVhat kind of a market does the mail order house of fer for any of the farm products How much does the mail order merchant give toward the preachers salary the building of churches About the only good the mail order merchant does in return for the business he obtains from any community is to help raise the standing and class of the post office Suppose that every one ordered goods from the mail order houses Be sides the inconvenience of having to wait for goods having goods lost in shipping putting onest self at the mer cy of the railroad and express compan ies the expense would be greater The burden of supporting all institu tions would be directly upon the shoul ders of the buyers and if the effi ciency of schools roads courts and the like were not decreased the ulti mate consumers would soon bo break ing forth with strenuous objections to the increased taxation Such a sys tem would destroy towns except the very large cities make railway ser vice poor and cause the movement toward the use of improved methods and machinery to sink into degener ation Such would be the case if every buyer would give his trade to the mail order concerns and plainly if a few buyers do this they take advantage of their neighbors their townspeiple They doan economic harm to their community by putting their money out of circulation in their own com munity The efforts ot the merchants of any town to be of service to that town by keeping goods on hand which may be obtained by customers quickly and conveniently deserve to have the support of the citizens of that com munity His interests arc identical with the best interest of the commu nity while the mail order firm cares absolutely nothing about community affairs and does nothing whatever to ward helping bole problems which confront it BACK TO COLUMBIA Back to Columbia will be the slo gan when the Thanksgiving games are played in this city It will be heard from the alumni and the parents of the students who have any interest in football Putting aside all question as to whether it is better to play the game here or in Kansas City one ele ment -will be pronounced that of gathering of the University clans The stadium at Kansas City has no tradi tions yet and the city itself is tree from all college day memories In a large measure it will be the traditions and rememberances of tor mer days that the students of old will want to revive when they come back to the college town This will be a sad and a glad time for those that return Old faces will have passed away old landmarks will have been erased and old sights that greeted the student in former years will have been wiped out On the other hand there will be sat isfaction of the feeling that demands to see the Alma Mater Only those who have spent four years at college can know what it means to come back and revive the old memories In this sense the game will be es sentially a college game and outside influences will be largely eliminated IN WINTER PREPARE FOR SPRING In the winter no paving can be done nor sidewalks be put down but it is a good time to plan these improve ments so that when spring conies work may be resumed immediately The farmer can not plant his seed when the snow is banked up around the house and the wind is howling around the corners but he can sit be fore the fire place and picture to him self this field in corn that one in oats and so on There are a great many plans to be made on the light and water proposi tion Constructing a new system can not begin before next spring but the plans can be made now There is a time for plalis and a time for work Laws making industry less danger ous for tho laborer should be more stringent The recent factory lire in Xew Jersey were two small fire es capes were the only means of exit and where a number of working girls lost their lives in jumping from a burning building is only one of the tragedies brought about by carelessness in re gard to the safety of employes That Oklahoma increased more than 109 per cent in population in the last ten years accounts in a large de gree for the fact that Missouri went back from fifth to seventh place in population Fifteen killed during tho present football season and 113 during the hunting season You take your choice of being kicked in the head or shot in tho back ngwrTr -

UNIVERSITY MISSOURIAN Events in the World English Parliament Dissolved The English Parliament was dis solved by King George early last week and the severe contest between the House of Lords and the Liberals which has been subdued to a certain extent for some time is on It is thought by many that this contest will yet result in a social revolution in Great Britain The new parliament which will be elected either in this month or in January will meet Jan uary 31 1911 In the kings dissolution speech which was read before both bodies of Parliament he said it was his inten tion to follow in the footsteps of his father in regatd to the government ot Great Britain He also said that he regretted that the conference held for the solution or the difficulties of the two houses was not successful in bringing about an agreement The whole political aspect in Eng land may be summed up in the ques tion Will the king obey the people and help abolish the rights of the Lords This is the dominating issue at present and it has been hinted by some of the more radical that in the event the king fails to help the Lib erals in the coming election he may loso his throne The Last Knockout Jem Mace heavy weight of Eng land and veteran of more than r00 prize fights died or old age in his seventy-ninth year Ho was a survivor1 fought In the ling with their bare fists and there was little argument over the Marquis of Queensburys rules or the rights to the moving picture con cerns Although he had amassed a fortune of about a million dollars at one time it went as it came and old age found him dependent upon his friends However though he was financially bankrupt he was not phys ically so His death removes the last trace of the pugilists of the old school The Sugar Trust The governments suit against the Sugar Trust which was filed in the United States Circuit Court at New York this week marks the final step in tho campaign against that organi zation which by the recent exposures has appeared openly before the pub lic as one of the most criminal insti tutions that has been allowed to exist this long in open violation of the Sher man Act Its open violation of this act has not been the most serious crime that this organization has com mitted it has not even hesitated to try frauds on the customs by the use of false scales and weights A corporation that would resort to such means as these to defraud should be dissolved but the Sugar Trust may get off easier than that According to the instructions to the courts they are not asked to dissolve the organiza tion but merely to find that the course of business that it has pursued from the first series of consolidations which brought it into existence has been in restraint of trade It Was a Mistake Dr Frederick A Cook the explorer who has been hiding for about a year has come to light in an article in a magazine in which he confesses that he does not know whether he reached the North Pole or not He says that he will return to the United States about Christmas so that he will get hero at another joyful time This time he is begging the people of the world to read his magazine article and give his case thorough thought before condemning him which seems useless His story deals with the psychologj of the adventures on the trip and he says that he was laboring under r delusion when he returned to this country from the exploring trip He claims that the trials that ne had un dergone on the expedition were re sponsible for a lapse of memory and when he had been applauded and crowned with laurel wreaths that he lost his head He says that laboring under a hallucination he had imag ined that he had really reached the North Pole Thus the people had been tricked The Presidents Message President Tafts second annual mes sage to Congress was finished Wed nesday but it will not be read before that body until Tuesday While the President has been urging his cabinet to boil down their estimates for the appropriations for the next year it seems that he showed no aptitudeto follow the plan advocated when he wrote his message That article con tains something like 20000 words which are necessary for the President to convey to Congress his views about legislation the condition of the coun try and the recommendations for the future Peace Again in Mexico Although -the last two weeks have seen everything that would indicate a general uprising in Mexico thorn was a peaceful termination of the dis turbance when President Diaz and Ra- 5 i r raon Corral who had been elected to the presidency and vice presidency took the oaths of their office this week Although the ceremonies attending the inauguration were not as elaborate and gorgeous as those of other years be cause of the recent disturbances they were nbvertheless as dignified This is the eighth time that Porfirio Diaz has been inaugurated chief executive of Mexico C A H HOW
