Pat them in the field, so as to have them ready for the Spring campaign, even if it resulted in the freedom of those that were so or ganized. He would employ them to- fight the negro force of the enemy, aye. and the Yankees themselves. The ques tion is, whether the enemy shall nse our slaves against as, or we nse them against them. The Governor recommends that the Btato borrow the gold of the Bank to purchase Confeuera'e currency at twenty for one, the gold to be re'uroed at th end of the war.

There ia a good proepeot that the ioter-oeeanic rente via San Jaau will soon be re-opened. After enumerating the Sonth A cerican republics, with which enr relations are of a mcst fri.cdly nature, he so licits authority to furnish a gunboat to Liberia, the coet to be reimbarsed ta the United States by iasta 'meats. The noble design of telegraphic communication tetween Amer cand Great Britain has been rene red with tne full ex pectation of its early accomplishment. The rebellion in China has at last been suppressed with the co-operation and good offices ot this goyernment anl othr State. He says that the ports of Norfolk, Fere a ad in a arid Ptn- sacola hare been opened, and it ia hoped that foreign mor chants will resort to these and the other open ports, rather than pursue contracts and trade with other portj c'oaed by a lawful and effective block ids.

After reference to variou su jjecti of no general interest to Confederate readers, Lincoln notices the continuance of the war with results which he regards as Important. 'He reoommenda the proposed amendment to the constitution aboliahing tlavery throughout tho United States. He refra to the result of the recent eection as an evi dence of the purpese of the people of tho loyal States to maintain tho integrity of the Union. Oa careful consideration it seems to cie no attempt at negotiatioa with the in-mrgnt leader oould result i; any good. He would accept nothing short of a tev9rance of the Union, which we cannot voluntarily yield. Its issue can only be tried by war and be decided by viotory, bat the Southern people caa re-accept union, and the amnesty oSered one yar ago is still open to all on condition to make a f . se ch-jic. . In conclusion, LukiIj rajs'itLo rri'l not retreat or modify his emancipation proclamation, and la stating a single condition ot peace he means simply to fay that war will cease on the part of the U.

The humm heart was not made for lie residence of sucb an inha . tant. It finds itself prejed upon by a torment which it does not acknowledge to Cod or man. A vul ture is devouring it, Ehd it can aes no sympathy or assistance, tithe-r from heaven or earth.- ibe secret which the murderer possesses soon cornea to possess him ; and like the evil spirit of wnich we read, it-overcomes him, and leads him wbithersosver it will.
