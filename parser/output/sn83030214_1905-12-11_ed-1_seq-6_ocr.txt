A,few weeks ago a New-Orleans physician, Dr. Holt, addressed to the public a letter regarding thin year's epidemic of yellow fever iv Louisiana. JCegli^enoe was imputed in the document to both Dr. Soucboc, president of the State Board of Healtii. and to Dr. Kebab*, >jio local health of ficer of the Crescent City ; but the greater part of the attack was directed against the latter of- Bdal. It was epecincally charged that Dr. Kohnke had denied tlie existence of yellow fever In New-Orleans vrhen he must have been aware of Its presence, had indulged in threatening lan goage ween referring to reports which might be made of genuine oases and had expressed an in tention to defy the law. Dr. Kohnke has now seen nt to take, notice of these accusations, and repMes to Dr. Holt and other critics in a clrculai Mrhich has been widely distributed. To one or two charges the answer is that his utterances have been wrongly interpreted. He reproduces « letter from the doctor who is said to have been threatened In which the matter Is treated as a joke. Finally, Dr. Kobiike declares that after much deliberation Dr. Holt signed a petition last June for the reappointnsent cf tho present health officer, who has held the position for several years. Dr. Holt's attack is so effectually dis credited by thefce facts that his statements may !»«' disregarded. Nevertheless, there is reason for attempting to determine from other and less questionable testi mony how far Dr. Kohnke deserves blame. In Ihe first place, be njust be relieved of resiionsi b!iiiy for the importation of the first cases from *>ntrai America, because the health officer of New-Orleans does not control the quarantine sta tion near the moiuh of the Mississippi. That is « state Institution. Again, he had no authority to prevent the carrying of infection by refugees from New-Orleans to other parts cf Louisiana nnd to adjacent states. The law gives him no power over the railroad companies, he says, and his assertion may be accepted. A third plea in f*el£defeni« !s advanced which is convincing. It has been asserted that the mortality in the im mediate Tidnity of the French Market for three months prior to the first official recognition of trouble, July 12, should have warned him that something was wrong. Dr. Kohuke makes a sta tistical cciapariwm between that period and the corresponding one in 1904, and proves that there was practically nothing in the vital statistics to excite apprehension. Furthermore, according to his story, the health officer displayed great dili gence in tryin? to suppress tho disease when he first detected it« presence. In spite of his ef forts, however, it spread with startling rapid ity. In lees than a month 68 oases were re ported in twenty-tour hours, and two days later the number jumped to 105, though this record marked the turning point in the situation. Do these figures show the exercise of that energy and vigilance which New-Orleans had a right to expect in so experienced an official as Dr. Kohnke? 

NIAGARA AND THE SOOr One of the most important topics discussed by the International Waterways Commission was the diversion of water in the Niagara and the St. Mary's rivers for power purposes. At the "Soo" the practical effect is to threaten naviga tion in the canal around the rapids, whereas at Niagara there is danger of raining an almost unique piece of natural scenery. So far as we are aware, no anxiety has been felt regarding the adequacy of the supply for the Welland Canal. In one case, therefore, the objections are commercial ar.d in the other aesthetic; but In both they are so formidable as to deserve the most respectful consideration by the authorities, federal, state and provincial, to which the com mission appeals. Resolutions were adopted asking tJlat no more franchises for power developments at Niagara or Sault Sic. Marie be granted until an op portunity had been horded for a careful inquiry into the possible consequences of the privileges already conceded. This is so reasonable a request that disregard of it would provoke grave criti cism. At present official responsibility on tha American side of Niagara rests on the gov ernment of New-York Sfate. It is for the Legislature and Governor to gusrd against fur ther concessions, and they am probnbly be trusted to exercise the requisite vigilance, at least for a short time. Still, there is a widespread feeling tliat greater security would be insured by turning the control of tbe matter over to the federal authorities, which, since navigation 13 not Involved, have now no very distinct constitu tional power. Tha object could probably be at tained by ceding the Niagara reservation to the national government. President Roosevelt doubt less had in mind some such preliminary when In his last message to Congress be alluded to tbe desirability of the stace's turning the falis over to the nation. Before the step is taken courtesy and expediency would suggest deliberation over the propriety of giving to tbe state commission which is intrusted with the supervision of the reservation much larger powers tbnn it now pos sesses. In the mean time, since the falls can be protected only by co-operation between tno au thorities on both Fides of tho boundary. It is to be hoped that the government of Ontario will for the present discourage all applicants for new franchises. At Sault Ste. Marie an anomalous situation exists. The canal belongs to the United States government, whereas most, if not all, of the power plants which consume water in that neigh borhood aro on the Canadian side of the river. It would probably i»e impracticable to rescind any rights which have already been granted : but for the prevention of fun her drafts on nature's limited siippfy this country would evidently be dependent on the courtesy of the Province of On tario. By circuitous diplomatic routine it might be feasible to exercise iho necessary persuasion, but a resort thereto does not seem to be requisite. The explicit recommendations of the Interna tional Waterways Commission may prove equally potent, and these have undoubtedly been trans mitted already to Toronto. BATHfO THE 

BISOX. The organization of the American Bison so ciety, which \v:is effected in this city lasr week with Mr. Roosevelt as honorary president and Mr. William T. Homaday as president, is cord ially to be commended as the taking of a prac tical step to prevent, though at the eleventh hour, tho consummation of a great wrong. The extinction of the bison, to which we have come perilously near, would be a cause for extreme regret. From tho sentimental point of view, it would be disgraceful for us to permit the de struction of that animal, which Is perhaps the most distinctive and certainly the most impres sive of ail the characteristic fauna of America. From the utilitarian point of view it would be foolish and profligate to inflict upon the world the loss of a creature possessing such potential ities of profit. There should be maintained, then, on grounds of historic sentiment and for the sake of stu dents and lovers of natural history herds of bison of purest blood, in conditions resembling as closely as possible those of their ancient habitut, and in numbers sufficient to preclude any reasonable possibility of the stock's dying out. In more than a few states of this Union there are ample expanses of lanl well suited for bison ranges, which could bo devoted to no better purpose. It will be a worthy thing, whether through public or private munificence, there to maintain what will be perpetual re minders of those innumerable herds that once roamed the Western plain 3 and that were as typical of American wild life as lions and ele phants of Africa or tigers of Bengal. In addition, it will be a profitable thing to promote the propagation of the bison, either of pure or, more probably, of mixed blood, for their economic value. The worth of their hides, dressed with the hair, as "buffalo robes," was more familiar to the last generation than It is to the present, and the same may be said of their flesh as an article of food. For the sake of these things, the bison is well worth preserr inc. while the possibility of developi--\£ it—per haps through some admixture of other strains— into a working animal for agricultural labor and a beast of burden may be worthy of care ful consideration. The composition of the so ciety which has just been formed gives promise that all phases of this interesting question will receive expert attention, from which we may anticipate much satisfaction. 

GERMAN FINANCES. The nuances of the German Empire appear to be, as tbe Imperial Chancellor frankly confessed on Wednesday, in a far less gatisfactory condi tion than rn'ght be desired or expected in the case of so industrious and progressive a country. A rapidly iucr easing public debt and a chronic and increasing deficit In the yearly Budget are not agreeable characteristics of a nation's finances, especially when that nation is a com posite empire whose individual states have also their own individual debts, which in some cases are very large and burdensome. Twenty-eight years ago the imperial debt was only $18,050. 000. Now it is about $675,000,000. In addition Prussia has a national debt of $1,700,000,000, Baden of $100,000,000. Bavaria of $435,000,000, Hesse of $80,000,000, Saxony of nearly $250,000, 000, Wurtemberg of $130,000,000 and 6O on down to the principality of Selnvarzburg-Sondershau een, whose 81,000 inhabitants owe collectively some $1,390,000. We believe, however, that Reues, of the elder line, has no dobt, while Anhalt — happy duchy : — instead of a debt has a credit of $1,410,000. Besides this increase in debt, the German def icit shows symptoms of increasing nnd of getting back to or beyond its highwater mark of $20, 222,000 in 1901. It fell to $13,325,000 in 1902, rose to $15,450,000 !n 1903, declined to 514.025, 000 In 1904 and this year rose again to about $19,500,000. Those figures Indicate not only an unsatisfactory contrast between revenues and ejt penditures, but also, as Germans are themselves freely declaring, an unsntisfaetory system of ad ministering the fiscal affairs of the empire. It is argued that it would be better to add what ever might be necessary to tbe fixed tax burden NEW-YORK DAILY TRIbCNE. MOXfeAY, DECEMBER 11. 1005. of the empire bo as to make the Budget balance than to have each year a deficit which must be met in some special way. It is now proposed to take some such step as that With a now chronic deficit of nearly or quite $20,000,000. and with large additional ex- Benditures demanded for army, navy and other purposes, it is planned to make an increase in the regular inr-ome of the empire to the amount of about $62,500,000 a year. That means another dollar a year for, or from, every, inhabitant of the empire. How to pecure It without overbur dening the people is a serious problem. It Is reckoned that a part of It will come from In creased customs under the new tariff, but the bulk of It must come from new internal taxes. An increase of 63 per cent of the beer tax is pro posed, which would produce $15,000,000 a year, and an additional tax on foreign tobacco, which would further protect the home industry, would produce $10,000,000. Some additional stamp taxes nnd death duties are also in view, and as a final re«ort there is talk of calling for roatric ular contributions from the states. It is interesting to observe that, In the face of this condition of affairs, there is, excepting on the part of the Social Democrats, general acquiescence in the new navy programme, which contemplates the expenditure on the navy of nearly $1,000,000,000 in the next twelve /oars. That may be regarded as unwise, even as extrav agant, but it is nevertheless to be reckoned with as a fact by those European nations which meas ure their own naval needs by the examples of their neighbors. The German navy is now the third in Europe, and is striving to become the second in the near future, and ultimately first At present, as the new bill shows, the empire is pushing Its naval expansion somewhat more vigorously than any of Its neighbors. But with imperial finances in so unsatisfactory a state it may be a question how long it can maintain the present rate of expenditure on armaments. TO 

BOYCOTT "WASHEE-WASHEE." The ingenious suggestion Is made by Ameri cans in China who have suffered from the boy cott there, according to a Tribune correspond ent at Hankow, that it would be an effective thing for Americans at home to retaliate in kind by boycotting the Chinese laundries. It is represented that Hop Sing and Wun Lung and all the rest of them who work all night transforming our shirt collars into jig-saws are employes of the Six Companies, which are chiefly responsible for the boycotting of Ameri can goods in China, and that if the business of the laundries wer<* to follow the trail of Othel lo's occupation there would quickly be a change of policy at Canton. Maybe. There can be no doubt that cessa tion of American— including Irish, German. Italian, Swedish. Polish, Bohemian, Russian et al.— patronage to the Chinese laundries would gravely affect the. business of those interesting institutions. The rule has hitherto been "No tickee. no shirtee!" enforced by John with in flexible resolution; and we remember that on one memorable occasion, when an obstreperous patron insisted with force and arms upon secur ing "shirtee" without a corresponding surrender of "tickee," Jehu promptly tripped him prone and began applying the hottest of smoothing irons to various exposed parts of his anatomy with amazing effect. But a natural corollary of that nilo -would be "No shirtee. no waafaee!"' and a sequel of that would be "No w.ishee, no laundree'." And if no shirts were presented to be washed, and there vras therefore no wash ing and in turn, of course, no more laundries, what would become of the Six Compnnies-al ways supposing the Six Companies to be real, live things and not, as some have suggested, a mere solar myth? We should be half inclined to take up this suggestion as a grout national issue if it were not for our reluctance to deprive a too indoleut generation of the invariable object tessoi which John presents In rekalsbminlng and burnishing our linen at 3 o'clock a. m. With that example of industry removed, we should have tears for the future of America. Besides, we have an idea that Hop Sing, Wun Lung and the rest have already on various occasions been pretty severely harried by the Hoodlum amcricamim, and also that some most estimable mandarins Lave failed to be treated in this country with the courtesy which stamps the caste of \ ere de Vere Suppose that instead o/f boycotting the coolie John we treat the mandarin Li as a man and a brother and not as a "blanked Chink. yORTH VERSUS SOUTH JERSEY. New-Tersey is not a large state, and yet it pre sents some odd contrasts within its borders. Dunn" this year's campaign the cry of In dependence, the denunciation of bossisni and of corporate interference in politics rang over the land Nowhere, perhaps, was it stronger than in the northern section of New-Jersey. In deed Mr Everett Colby was stirring things up in Essex County long before there was any sign of excitement elsewhere in the country. Then, in the adjoining county of Hudson. Mayor r agan was conducting a magnificent tight for the "square deal." But, somehow, through It all the southern end of the state remained inseus.tive Even when Philadelphia arose in its might and stormed the citadel with a force and vehemence never before known in the Quaker City those New-Jersey communities across the Delaware Iliver moved along at their usual gait, unstirred and sluggish. Not a growl against bossism ; not a howl about machines or anything else. With South Jersey it was a case of "standing pat ' Maybe the reasons which prompted peo ple'elsewhere to join in the great reform move ment were non-existent there. It is probably true that the bosses In South Jersey are so easy and gentle that only the velvet gloves of their iron hands are felt. Then, too. the population is so scattered in most counties that the people are especially grateful for railroad and trolley facilities and unwilling to hamper the transpor tation companies. These facts probably explain in some measure the seeming apathy of a large section of New-Jersey while the remainder of it was worked into fever heat on Issues that one might expect to affect the whole state in pretty much the same manner. Other explanations ma^ develop during the legislative session which be gins a month hence, and it will be interesting to note them. MONET AXD BUSINESS. In the face of the highest rate for call money In over three years price* of securities made a net gain last week to within about on© point of the record established a few months ago. and several stocks attained new maximum positions. It Is almost unprecedented to see the market so stubbornly supported during a period of finan cial stringency, arid it emphasizes the statement made in tills column some time ago that the large operators were provided with money bor rowed on time when the rate was low, so that they have not felt the recent pressure. Un doubtedly the eharp fall In sterling Indicated that there were heavy offerings of finance bills, which means that some traders In Wall Street are borrowing from Europe to operate In this market. Undoubtedly the President's message was an agreeable surprise to the stock market, the short account having been swelled in antici pation of some radical suggestions regarding railway rate regulation. Were it not for the monetary complications and the fact that prices are already abnormally high, some reason for encouragement might be found in the latest statements of railway earnings, particularly that of the Union Pacific. But the market la not normal and does not respond to natural Influ ences. Call loans have again risen above 20 per cent, and bankers do not look for any return to easy conditions before the middle of next month. Fluctuations tn rates of domestic exchange In dicate that Interior Institutions are desirous of taking advantage of tne attractive terms pre* vailing in the local money market, but the ac tivity of general business and the handling of the crops keeps most of the available supply engaged at home. Some discrimination is noted for the first time this season in lending on In dustrial securities, and in all financial oper ations evidences of conservatism Increase as the situation becomes more complicated. Holi day requirements will he beyond precedent, and demands for small change are already taxing Treasury facilities. The stringency is not due to any reduction in thr total available amount of money, for the per capita circulation on De cember 1 was officially reported a a •*"! 7&, which is nine cents higher than a month pre vious, when all earlier records were surpassed. Rates of foreign exchange declined sharply as the money market advanced, until quotations reached the point where gold imports were ar ranged a few months ago; but in the mean time the price of bar gold has advanced at London. A heavy loss of cash carried the reserve of the associated banks once more helov. th« l»gal limit. That the monetary stringency Is chiefly due to speculative causes is clearly demonstrated by the fact that commercial activity Is in no way retarded and mercantile payments are satisfac torily prompt in most sections of the country. The closing month of the year promises to con tinue the favorable comparisons made by Its immediate predecessors, bank exchanges rising far above those of 1904, omitting .this city, wh^re speculative acttvlty renders it difficult to secure an accurate measure of payments in com mercial channels. While the weather has been more favorable for retail trade in seasonable merchandise. It has not yet seriously retarded outdoor work, building operations being on a phenomenal scale and prices of all materials very firmly held. It is necessary to go back twenty-two years to find a time when the gen eral level of prices of all commodities was higher than at present, and. even making a moderate allowance for the effect of speculation at the commodity exchanges, it is evident that consumption mus' be beyond all records, since the relations of demand and supply in the long run determine cost. Sensational developments followed the depart ment's estimate off 1 a cotton crop of only 10.K57, 81S bales. Although a number of private au thorities had predicted so low a total, there was a general belief that the official figures would be much larger, and the session immediately be came one of great excitement. Before the close of the market on Monday it was estimated that 1,500.000 bales had changed hands, and, in stead of the usual market unit of 100 bales, transactions were made in blocks of .'.OOO bales or more. Evidently a very large short interest existed, and before these contracts were closed the price had risen about a cent a pound. In stead of the reaction that usually follows such a violent advance, prices continued rising on subsequent days, until spot middling uplands at this city sold £22 50 a bale higher than a year ago, or about the same price that ruled at the corresponding date in 1903. In commenting on the official statement it was pointed out by ex perts that the estimate last year was 1,.">00,000 bales too small and that Southern planters are known to be holding back cotton for which they hope to "receive 13 cents. Yet port receipts are remarkably well maintained, and exports do not show the decline from last year's figures that might be expected. Manufacturing plants in the leading indus tries have so much business under contract for future delivery that the usual stoppages for stock taking and repairs will be restricted as far as possible, and inventories promise to show a remarkably good record for the year, although during the opening months conditions were quiet in many lines. Forwardings of footwear from Boston are breaking all records, and pro ducers find no opposition to f-o higher quota tions, while still further advances cannot be avoided if the markets for hides and leather are maintained at their abnormal position. Hides are sold for February delivery at current quo tations, which is equivalent to another ad vance, because the winter take-off will be of pborer quality. Although some lines of cotton goods are still quoted at former prices, the gen eral tendency Is upward, as might be expected, in view of the prices that spinners will be com pelled to pay for future supplies of raw cotton, unless a violent reaction occurs in that staple. Woollens are well maintained, and the position of raw wool was improved by results at the sixth series of the London auction sale. New business Is steadily offered to steel producers, greatest activity coming from the requirements of the railways. A dozen men, lacking one, have already been convicted or are in hiding in connection with election frauds, and still Mayor McClellan's counsel oppose an honest recount of the ballots. rSoes the Mayor want the office whether honest ly elected or not? The nervousness exhibited by people in Suffolk County over the proposition to establish a sana torium for tuberculosis is natural, perhaps, but unwarrantable. Those who aro most familiar with the facts declare that nowhere else is there such an assurance of Immunity as in the imme diate neighborhood of an institution of this kind. With the United States? sending macaroni wheat to Europe and wines to France, the proverb about sending coals to Newcastle seems to be practically realized. It is not surprising, however, that this country thus competes, in various markets of the world, in products hither to confined to exclusive and remote localities, for the extent and variety of the American domain are such as make it a practical epitome of the whole world. There is scarcely a soil or a cli mate, apart from the Arctic and Tropic ex tremes, that Is not to be found here— hot or cold, wet or dry, constant or variable. What is needed is to ascertain the character and capa bilities of each part of the country, and 'then adapt its industries thereto. That is one of the most valuable servloea the Agricultural Depart ment can perform. "Public affairs," said Machiavelli, "are easily managed In a city where the body of the people is not corrupt." An intimation that in our great cities the body of the people was corrupt would be properly resented as a calumny. Then why should it be so difficult to manage their affairs? Was the illustrious Florentine mistaken in his municipal philosophy? Or is publio spirit less influential in public affairs here and now. than it was then and there?* For expert naval testimony commend to us Admiral Rojeatvensky, who Is probably the best qualified man in the world to tell how a modern war fleet can be annihilated by the enemy. Speaking with mature deliberation, long after the battle of the Sea of Japan, he says the Jap anese victory was won entirely by their guns. None of the projectiles penetrated the Russian ships, but the repeated shock of the projectiles striking and bursting against them disjointed their steel plates, sprung the rivets and set them to leaking like cieves, so that the centre of gravity was shifted and the vessel* sank. This effect pf the firing, he says, was entirely different from what had been expected. W« must regard this tribute to the Japanese guns, however, as applying equally to the men behind the guns, for the Russian admiral says that had the crews of the fleets been of equal value the result would have been different. As it was, th« Russian crews quickly became demoralized by the awful fire of the Japanese, while the Jap anese remained unaffected, continuing their fire with composure and with mathematical preci sion. That is about what ths observant world concluded concerning the battle some time ago, an:l it is giatifying to have its Judgment thus confirmed by the unsurpassed authority of the man behind tho target. And now Senator Tillman is becoming rantan kerooa and toys with his pitchfork as ha talks about that lif» insurance policy of which he i» the unhappy possessor.
