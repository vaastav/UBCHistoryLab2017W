THE POLITICAL SITUATION The election of nominees for the Presidency by direct vote in pri maries is not new. It is only its in dorsement by President Wilson in a message to Congress last week that makes it the topic of the hour. The movement has undoubtedly been Riven tremendous impetus by. the President's utterance, even though he i onlj following where others hae led It is always difficult, of course, t i definitely name the originator of nil new idea, but in this case the honor of being the pioneer rests most largely with former Senator Jonathan Bourne, of Oregon In 1908, when President Roosevelt was maneuvering ti nominate Taft as his successor, his influence and the energetic labors of administration officeholders secured the Oregon delegation There was doubt, however, as to whether Mr. Taft was the real choice of the Oregon people, and a Portland news paper conducted a test to determine the question The result demonstrated that the doubt was well founded This led Senator Bourne to devise a pn marv law which would allow the vot er-, f Oregon to decide for thetn-elves 1 the matter of a Presidential nonn 1 t This law having been passed, the elegates who go from Oregon to a i at nil convention now vote for the u 1 lati who is the choice of a ma- nt) I he v-tcm thus inaugurated ITcmi has been adopted by thir- 1 r 1 thcr btates California Georgia, t larland.

It took more than $250,000, according to the evidence of Chairman McCombs, to elect Wilson delegates to the Balti more convention and a very large pro portion of this sum was naturally dis bursed in States which had Presiden tial primary laws. It would be no exaggeration to say that millions of dollars was spent in the effort of various candidates to se cure the nomination a fact which gives basis to the criticism of Senator Gallinger that the primary plan gives a rich man an advantage over a poor man. Can Expenditures Be Limited? It is asserted by the advocates of the new system that expenditures can be limited by law. This may be so. At the same time publicity costs moncj and without pub licity a candidate might as well dwell in the cave of Abdullam The great concerns which seek nation-wide pat ronage for their products will easily expend $250,000 in a single adver tising campaign. It is difficult to see. therefore, how legitimate expenses can be curtailed by law, and this means that the aspirant with money of his own or wealth at Ins command can ef fectively organize his campaign in every State. It is difficult to see how under the proposed new order of things a second Abraham Lincoln could be nominated More than this, if expenses are to be limited, the occupant of the White House who sought renommntion would have a tremendous advantage over any. com petitor. He eould secure publicity for every word and" action without ex pending a pennv, while he could timid up an organization of his office-holding friends in every State All this would avail nothing, of course, if he had failed in his administration, but grant ing that he has not forfeited public conhdence he certainly could manipu late the political machinery at a min imum of cost. The duplication of elections and the enormous expense of a State-wide campaign 111 everv State are certainly two objections which will be empha-l sued when the proposed primary law is given serious consideration i precursor to' the abolition of "the elec toral college and the election of a President by the direct vote of the people. This will necessitate a con stitutional amendment, but recent ex periences have demonstrated that amendments can be framed and rati tied with comparative ease. It will not be Jong before conventions will be a thing of the past. President Wilson's suggestion that these conventions should be composed of candidates and national committeemen is already in operation in Kansas, where State and county candidates meet In party coun cil after they have been nominated by the people and formulate a platform. As they arc all anxious to be elected they subscribe only to those declara tions which they hope will attract the largest number of voters. In Illinois the State convention is held after the candidates have been chosen in the primaries and it is purely a perfunc tory affair Nobody listens when the platform is read. This will be the na tional experience. Either the candi dates of both parties, in conventions assembled, will vie with each other in appealing to popular prejudice or sen timent, or, if the platform be framed by delegates who are not candidates, nobody will care a rap for the utter ance and the campaign issue will be the personal equation of the nominees. It is almost safe to predict that the conventions of 1916 will be the last held in the United States. By 1920, if the present tendency toward polit ical control by direct popular vote is not checked, there will be no inter mediate agency of any kind between the people and the result Seven years is a brief period in the history of a nation. It is sufficient, however, to bring about radical changes. Seven years ago a Presiden tial primary was unknown Today it is established by law in fourteen States Seven "years ago the election of L mtcd States Senators by direct vote of the people seemed beyond be lief Today it is the supreme law of the land The wheels of time are revolv -ing rapidly Their noisy whirr drowns the voice of caution There seems to be no time to s'op and think.

The rec ord shows that money was poured like water into other States, not only by the Roosevelt, but by the Taft organ ization. Former Representative Mc Kinley, the head of the Taft bureau, testified that he expended about $265,000 j'i the Taft pre-comention caropayn, and this. ;o did not in- the rule of the people It is unquestionably true that con ventions do not always nominate the man who might be said to be the pop uhr choice If the Presidential pn marv svtem had been in vogue in 1876 the nominee of the Republican party would have been Ulysses S. Grant and not Rutherford B Haves This is only one instance out of many. Last vear Theodore Roosevelt and not Will iam H. Taft would have been the Re publican candidate, for Roosevelt car ried every State in which Presidential primaries were held, except Massa chusetts It is also possible, although by no means certain, that Champ Clark would have received the Demo cratic nomination over W'oodrow Wil son In the primaries. Clark carried California, Illinois, Marvland, Massa chusetts, and Nebraska, while Wilson was the choice 111 New Jersey, Wis consin, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota If President Wilson disregards the one-term declaration of the Baltimore platform and no unto ward events mar ins administration he will unquestionably be the popular choice of his party in 1916, no matter how many States adopt the primary system It would hardlv be worth while tor anv other candidate to enter the lists against him. There is, a good deal of force to tne assertion mat tue people suould determine for themselves who shall be their candidates for President In a sense they do that now, because coun ties send delegates to district and State conventions, which in turn choose the delegates to the national convention This, however, is the old representative system upon which our government is constructed and from which, perhaps, unfortunately, we are fast drifting away. The proposed plan more nearly accords with the growing sentiment in favor of a pure democ racy in which a direct majority vote is the controlling factor. If we are to have the new plan, however, there ought to be some compulsion regard ing voting. The figures of the Presi dential primaries last year were startling revelation of the number of voters who did not go to the polls. In Pennsylvania, for instance, the nor- jmal Republican vote is from 700,000 to 750,000. In the primaries only a little over 450,000 ballots were cast, of which Roosevelt received 275,000, or a little over one-third of the entire Republican voting strength. 'The same is practically true of all other can didates in all the other States. It might easily happen, therefore, that the active adherents of a so-called popular candidate might win in the primaries when such a result might not be best for the welfare of the country. In Re the Pronty Bill. In its present incomplete form it would be both unfair and unwise to criticise the Proutv bill in detail. The bill is of grave importance, because it represents a growing resentment in the House of Representatives against the present form of government here, and of graver importance because it ex presses that resentment intelligently and well. Representative Prouty is honest and logical and cie-ires to do justice to the Distnct of Columbia and to the peo ple of the United States In fact, he is actuated quite as much in framing the measure, bv a desire to give the people of the District self-government, as he is by a belief that the District should be self-sustaining We think Mr Prouty is wrong, but we will vouch for his sincerity, in tegrity of purpose, and intelligence. And if a bill to foist on the Dis trict a form of government it does not desire must be framed, we would as lief have it framed by S F Prouty as any man 111 Congress, and a good deal Miefcr" than by a great many men whose names we can recall The Hobson campaign for Senator con tinues In Alabama with the Merrlmac hero all else but discouraged as the fight goes on with some novel and Dosaibiv depressing; features. One esteemed journal has found a new way to be absolutely fair and Impartial In Its treatment of the Hobson Senntnr-ini diversion. It sends two reporters with him on all his speaking; tours one friend ly, me other opposed. They each write their impressions of each meetlnir. th speech and reception accorded the h.rn. and then the two reports are printed side ay siae. As might be expected, the Hobson re. porter elves his candidate a splendid send-off each day. and the onnoaltlnn reaches around for words to express his aisgust witn uie whole performance. The Hobson reporter tells how St3 people crowded Into a hall to hear the Hobson speech and were political propositions meaning much for the Democratic nartv of the State in the future and the stimu lation was greater because of the Repub lican State committee meeting in New York today. Gov. Glynn announced when he took hold that he would not be a can didate for governor next year, but .he Is wonderfully interested in all the nlanm discussed by home Democrats during his stay In Washington for the retention of his party in power at Albany. The gov ernor Is the owner of a Democrat news paper in the Capital City and he wants Democrats doing things aided each day by the advice of the Glynn esteemed family journal. Like Gov, Cor of Ohio, the New York governor has never let go of his news paper property or the love for editorial functions, and he remarked while here that he was proud to continue an editor no matter what happens in politics Only a dozen years ago Glynn and the Hon.

All three took pains to leave for New York In time for the meeting. and took three different opinions to the council of wise ones called for today. and which promises more for the future of the party in New rorK man any gathering of recent years. The Hon. W. T.

The Hon "FIngy," as his admirers prefer to rail him, has never hankered for political office enough to hurt but he has kept busy enough for others with out receiving quite as much reward or credit as he deserved. However, he was not allowed to be lonesome while In Washington, thanks to Democrats from home and from other States, who know he Is ever active and present at a na tional convention.

To write "Personal" on a letter ad dressed to the President of the United States Is just about as effective as tle- lng a "Do Not Open Until Chriitmas" tag on a peanut and handing it to an aver age park squirrel. Yet about halt the people who write letters to Woodrow Wilson put ""I'er sonal" or "Strictly Confidential" on the envelope. In the belief that no one but the writer, the President and tne Al mighty will ever know what is inside. Other writers Inclose "letters to the President In an envelope addressed to Secretary Tumulty and explain to Turn ulty that the letter is about eomethlng that the President wouldn't want a llv lng soul to be In on. Still other writers send letters in care of Mrs. Wilson, or one of the President's daughters, the idea being that the Presi dent will then find such letters on his plate at the breakfast table without any of the secretaries having a chance to mull them over. As a matter of fact none of these schemes work. For example, the only effect of addressing a letter In care of ono of the Presidents family Is to de lay It slightly. It must go to the AMilte House first and then be sent over lo the executive offices. A letter to the President enclosed with one to Tumulty, is opened and read ty Tumulty, and If 't wire of much consequence it probably would reach him anyway, and be would show it to the President If he thought it worth while. Every once In a whll there Is a pretty little story In the papers about some poor little blue-eyed boy of delightful personality who wrote a letter to tho Presidents daughter and urged her In fluence to get his papa out of jail, a Det tt? job, or something like that And how the heart of the President's daugh ter was touched and the proposition went right through in a jiffy. Strictly speak ing, such stories are true, but here is the Idea: The chances are that all that the Presi dent's daughter had to do with the episode was to turn the letter over to the boys In the executive office to be ban' died In tlie usual way. If the case Is a pathetic one and seems to have merit It Is looked into and some favorab e ac tion may be taken. And If the letter had come In the usual way. Instead of through the President's daughter, the case prob ably would have been looked up anyhow, with Identically the same favorable result The only difference Is that without the hu man interest angle the Incident would have been too prosaic to find Its way Into the papers and no one would have beard about It THE

Mayor Shank was a failure as an of ficial, but he made the paragraphera happy; By K. J. KDVVAHDs.. LRIN J one of my visits to Great Britain some years ago I met John Hennlker Hcaton, who. next to Roland Hill, did more for the postal system of Great Britain than any other one man. I had already been in roirespondence with Mr. Hcaton as long ago as the time when I was Postmaster General at 'Washington Mr. Heaton was a strong advocate of penry ocean postage, a policy In which I thoroughly agreed with him " Former Postmaster General Thomas I James began, with this reference o Sir. Heaton an anecdote telling of his experience with Lord Randolph Churcnlll shortly after the marriage of Lord Randolph to Jennie Jerome, of New York "Mr. Heaton told me." said Gen James, "that Lord Randolph Churchill had an extraordinary gift for collecting facts, not only by reading books, but by keeping himself In touch with people who would give him information, ind. furthermore, that he was able by unusual and really Intuitive processes of mind thorough!) to digest and assimilate Into orderly and systematic rela tion a great many facts which he obtained by asking questions of those who would give him accurate arswers. "I was remlided of this statement of Mr. Heaton's by an experjence of my own. I think it was ir. me summer or 1874. although I am not quite certain about the date, that Leonard Jerome, who was a friend of mine, called upon me to ask If it would be convenient for me to see his new son-in-law. Lord Randolph Churchill, at the postofllce in New York City. Of course, I was only too glad to meet Lord Randolph, for I had been told that in England he was look-d upon as a man who had a great career In pnbllc life before him. Moreover, ho war of an Illustrious family, his brother being the Duke of Marlbcrough "a time that was convenient to both of us was then fixed upon, and at the hour set, Mr. Jerome called with Lord Randolph. I was greatly Impressed with the young man. I observed that he had a very keen eye and that he was Jtterlv wlthiut tho sort of phlegmatic manner sometimes characteristic of youthful men-bers of the Ergllsh aristocracy. He seemed to me more like an earnest inqu'sltivo Yankee. Within a moment after we had exchanged greet ings he began to ask me questions about the administration of the New York City postofflce. If he' had hren a cross-examiner he could not have been more persistent or searching than he was In his inquiries, He wanted to know all about our methods of collecting and delivering malt I should think that he was occupied at least fifteen or twenty minutes with asking me about the arrival of mails from Europe and our methods of distributing them, not only In New Yorl: City, but In the malls going to other parts of the country. ' soon discovered that Lord Randolph was not asking me these questions either as a matter of courtesy or out of idle curiosity. He was getting Infor mation. Ho was with me, I should say, about two hours, and I am certain that In all my experience as postmaster of New York or as Postmaster General I was never subjected to such persistent and searching Inquiry, all of it In the direction of Information or facts, as I was by Lord Randolph. "When the time came to part he was very cordial in his thanks. He said that I had given him the opportunity to become thoroughly informed respecting the American postal system and that he had obtained some good ideas, which he was sure would be put to use In the postofflce system of Graet Britain. "v few days later I met Mr. Jerome, and I said to him that his son-in-law had learned pretty much all there was to learn about the New York postofflce and the American postal service. That is the way Lord Randolph learns," Mr. Jerome replied. "He Is going to bo the best-Informed man In Great Britain, because, while he Is a areful reader, be Is a more careful and thorough Investigator at first sources. He never sees a man of intelligence without asking him some questions which will give hlra information. And that is equally true In The field of politics, cf business, of science and of literature." My own experience," continued Gen. James, "sufficiently explained to me why It was that when Lord Randolph Churchill entered the British cabinet he vat es'eemed the best-Informed man on the greatest variety of topics of Letters that go through the usual chan nel "personal"' letters and others are all opened by Ira bmith. whose J 5b at the White House Is to do just that About the only letters that Smith ever turns over to the Presides t unopened arc those from members of the President's Immediate famllj, and even those might be opened except for the fact that Smith has a knack at recognizing handwilting. The fact is that it is almost impossible to write a secret to the President "and have it still a secret when it reaches him. That is one of the great objections to being President Somebody might write a letter reminding the'Presldent of some boyhood Joke on him something that he wouldn't want known for, the world and yet half a dozen secretaries might read It before he did The letters that reach the White House every day for Ira Smith to open and sort out will run as high as 1000, to say nothing of perhaps 100 or 100 tele grams. Ordlnarlb, though, the mall is much less than that On an average day it will run s-omething like 300 Of this number probabl) one-half would be sent to some of the departments. The others would be sorted and sifted and hand- picked until a comparatively few remain to greet the President when he reaches his desk Many davs he has only about dozen letters to answer personally Even on the average the number is prob ably not more than twenty-five, which is not more than the President would get If he were merely a popular cotillion leader or a city councilman at Xenla, Ohio In addition to these few letters that he answers personally, however, are a considerable number that are disposed of for htm and the answers brought to him for his signature No one Is per mitted to sign the President's name even to the most trivial routine letter. Here of late the communications to President Wilson conveying the glad tid ings that a baby has just been named for him, have averaged four a day In dicating that by the end of the present administration. If the same rate should keep up, the name will be on the verge of becoming a drug on the market Four a day is considered too many let ters of one class for the President to answer personally, and these are all an swered for him In a routine way Hence If a fond mother goes rushing over to the neighbors without pausing to wipe the dough off her hands. In her eager ness to show the President's letter to her, she Is making a great mistake. The President probably never saw her note to him and did not dictate the answer.

Blowing I horns from 100 feet to a half block or more away, me macnines come tearing across the street at double the speed rate authorized by law. No pretense of giving pedestrians the right of way Is ordinarily shown. Machines driven by chauffeurs, women and sometimes boys, rush down and across the Avenue at racing speed. When the machine is about to run over some, bewildered pe destrian, the brakes are usually and suddenly applied by the annoyed driver. I believe there Is hardly a person who walks the streets that has not had one or more narrow escapes, and whose ex periences are not of similar character Crossing Fifteenth street on K street recently, a large motor car, driven by a grinning negro chauffeur, barely avoided the writer and his wlfo when we were crossing the street at the regular cross ing. In the car were three women nil of whomgrinned in a similar manner with meir smiling negro, as they observed the fright of my wife and my own fear of being run over Both of us are rea. onably agile, but a heavy car rounding a street corner at high speed Is liable to catch any one. providing the brake falls or the wheel is being handed by an Inexperienced or confused driver From personal experience I know that not one-half the drivers appreciate the tremendous power of the average car. The remed lies in several directions. First, no motor vehicle nor street car rt.ould cross any Intersecting street at more than six miles an hour or be per mitted to run anywhere in the cltj at more than double that rate of speed. Sec ond, every policeman who falls to strict ly cuiurce itie law, nnemer ne winKs a: the infraction of the law by a reckless boy or the highest official in the land, should be discharged The officers should be sustained In a strict enforcement of the law Make jail sentences without any alternative fine a punishment fo the violation of the street ordinances. In case of injury to a pedestrian, place the burden of disproving fault upon the motor car driver, on the theory that tha fctreets are primarily for pedestrians who outnumber the motor cars to to 1, on th average. A rigid enforcement of rea sonable regulations will dlcourage the tendency of the average motorist to seek crowded thoroughfares, to race with street cars in order to avoid stopping when passengers board the car A few wholesome Jail sentences would be of Inestimable value In emphasizing the rights ot pedestrians. The news col umns of every paper in the land where there are constantly growing lists of ac cidents, is authority for this statement I have no grouch against machines, for I have driven one in the past nor do I put all drivers in the above categon. cut as one rotten apple will ultimately rpoil a whole barrel, o will a few reck lts drivers in this city bring odium on i all the others. As stated at the beginning, this is writ ten personally and to commend jour ex cellent editorial on the subject JAMES A. FREAK. Seien Should Be Treated Mike. To the Editor In response to Tha Herald's request for opinions as to whether a woman should sutler capital punishment for murder. In my opinion it Is no worse for a man to commit murder than it is for a woman Murder is mur der It doesn t matter who commits it If women are allowed to go unpunished hat fear will they have of committing such crimes and what respect will the have for the law Some of your readers seem to think or pretend to think that when a woman commits a murder she should be honored and given a medal Such people are ab solutely brainless and. therefore, are not responsible for the statements thev may - make One of your readers auotes the Bible as saying. "Thou shalt not kill which Is correct but then why did not Mr-e Wakefield heed this' On the other hand, does not the Bible say thou shall take "An eye for an eje" life for life And has not Mrs. Wakefield taken what she cannot give If she commits one murder and Is not punished. let go free as some of your readers pretend to think is right and proper. Is she not liable to commit another crime The Ttpratd ha. il.tx.. M. ma...- only Iawubldlng citizens can. and I there- J . rore highly appreciate the views of The Herald. R. A. SCHNEIDER.
