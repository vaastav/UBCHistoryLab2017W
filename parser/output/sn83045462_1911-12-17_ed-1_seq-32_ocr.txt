KEEPS ABREAST OF TIMES Railroads Owned by Government and Other Innovations Welcomed. Has Small Debt. ?i ' I * - KpHS^B , JMHr v ':v?. >lah* Vajrn viirlh. Phra Mongkut Klao, HIbk of Slam. The coronation ceremonies attending the ascension to the throne of his majesty, Maha Vajiravudh, Phra Mongkut Klao, King of Siam, which have just been completed, set another milestone In the rapid march which Siam is making, and which has astonished the nations of the world. The very fact that the great powers sent members of their royal families to represent them at the coronation is an evidence of the interest and respect which they have for Siam. Unostentatiously, without upheaval, but vith amazing speed, the Siamese picked jp the progressive ideas and inventions of the western powers, and today a foreign ?r who journeys to uaneKOK, uip capital jf the nation, will find there railways, street cars, large electric light and gas plants, telephone service, in fact all of the best features of modern civilization. Young by Their Beckoning. The npit monarch, who has ascended the throne under the most favorable circumstances, takes up his reign in tiie year *30, according to the reckoning of the Silmese, who reckon the years from the establishment of the national capital of Bangkook. Their ne'w year's day falls on April 1 of the Gregorian calendar. Among the sjieciul ambassadors sent to Siam for the coronation were: His serene h ghness Prince Alexander of Teck, and his suite, representing Great Britain; his imperial highness the Grand Duke Boris and su.te, Russia; his royai highness Prince Waldemar and his three sons. Denmark; his royal highness Prince William. Duke of Sudder manie, and suite. Sweden; his highness Prince Fushimf and suite. Japan, and his royal highness Prince Nicholas, Greece. The I'nited States was represented by Hamilton King of Michigan. I'nited States minister to Siam, specially designated to represent the I'nited States at the coronation suite, including Col. Be a Febiger, 17. S. A. Much of the credit for the rapid development of Siam Is due to the late king. Cliulalongkorn, Phra Chula Chom Klao, who was a man of much ability and who took the lead in the adoption of the best features of the western civilization. One matter which his late majesty insisted upon was the education of the people of Siam. and the new monarch is proceeding along the same line, in consequence a system of public schools lias been established throughout the knigdom and is maintained on a high plane. Educated in England. The late king sent his son, who is now on the throne, to England, where he went through the military academy at Sandhurst and was attached for two years to an English regiment. He then r. 4 . . J : J .. 4 r?u x r % . li m?v r a Muuitnj at v unsi s * one&e, uxiuru. For many years it lias been the practice of Siam to send thirty or forty young men to European countries and to the United States to be educated. As fast as they receive an education they are recalled to Siam and their j?!aces lilied by others. I'pon these men is falling a large share of the work in modernizing the kingdom according to western ideas. It is rarticularly interesting to note that for many years the chief office in tiie Siamese government has been held by an American. Prof. Edward H. Strobe! was seleciecj for this important office ?that of general adviser?by the late king, who made a careful search for a disinterested and capable man for the position before making the appointment. Prof. Strobel went to Siam from Harvard University. Cnder his advice the progress of Siam was rapid and without friction of any kind. American to Fill Place. When Prof. Strobel died several years ago from blood poisoning due to the bite of an insect, received in Egypt on his way home for a vacation, another American was selected to 1111 his place as general adviser to the government. Jens Ivens Westenyard, also an instructor at Harvard, and Mr. Westenyard's services have been so satisfactory that he has been continued in office by the new king. An evidence of the liberality and gratitude of Siam is to be found in the pension which the government pays annually to the aged mother of the late Prof. Strobel, who is living in South Carolina, more than eighty years of age. The government of Siam pays her $1,75U a year for life. The Siamese are very friendly to the United States nut only because of the influence which lias been exerted by Prof. Strobel and Mr. Westenyard, but also because of the feelings entertained for this country by the Siamese who have visited t ... . . z i.. _t . - * I, ,, _ a i _ t .iiucri a, particularly me present King, who came to Washington during the administration of President Roosevelt and received a cordial welcome at the White House. He visited many of the important cities of the I'nited States and of Canada during his journey. It must be said, however, that Americans have been slow to awaken to the fact that a big Held for trade with Siam exists. Although Siam does a large export and import trade today, practically none of it is with the I'nited States, and nearly all of it is with European nations, especially Great Britain and Germany. A Benevolent Despotism. The government of Siam is a benevolent despotism. The steps which have been taken for the beneHt of the people and for the development of the country have all originated with the king and the nobilltj. The various departments of the government such as the foreign office, the department of the interior, the war department, the department of justice, are intrusted to members of the ministry, who are select'-d by the king with preat care. While Siam is properly called a despotism and tlie authority of the king is ibsolute and is handed down from father -o son in the royal family, the unusual social system of Slum tends'toward de moeracy. Men in Siam may be said to * 

INQUISITIVE W] kJ v , what are ^ rw ma vc making? pair q' WHAT'S THAT TH| THING VE'RE OP PUMPING ? ? WKATS INSIDE THEY'RE THEM ? O'WIND I ' - -YERSELF. I'D LUCE ' i L . i be all born free and- equal, with the ex- ' ception of the members of the royal family. There is, to be sure, the nobility. But no man is born a nobleman. No title descends from father to son, except in the royal family. The son of a nobleman must prove himself worthy of nobility before he attains that rank. And nobility is won only because of merit and of good work performed. In the case of the brothers of the king their sons do not receive the same title as their fathers, but are one degree lower in rank, and their sons, in turn, are one degree lower in rank than their fathers, unless by merit they may attain the higher rank. Thus the descendants of the royal princes may ultimately become the same as the rest of the people. There are live ranks in the nobility. Population Nine Millions. The population of Siam has been esti- ' mated at about O.OOO.OOO and the area 1 of the country is about the same as that \ of France. The Siamese are a different race from either the Chinese or the ! Japanese. Their straight black hair and !' dark eyes give the Siamese some resem- < blance of the Japanese, but their eyes | are straight and the general expression of the Siamese countenance is more that of a European. The capital, Bangkok, is a handsome i city of some 700,000 inhabitants! The street cars, the street lighting, telephone ] system and modern sanitation all give the impression of a modern western city. 1 The style of architecture Is being more s and more modeled after the western style and narticularlv the Italian. Their houses i are many of them similar to the detached houses which are found In the suburbs of cities in this country. The dress adopted by the people is western to a great extent also. In the public schools the only foreign language taught is Eng- 1 lish, which is the commercial language of the far east. Although the religion of the Siamese is Buddhism, the government makes no objection to such foreign missions as are established in Siam, particularly because many of the schools established by the missions teach English. The late king, just before he died, requested his son not to spend large sums of money upon a great funeral for him, but to spend such money as he desired to devote to the memory of his father for the benefit of charitable institutions. The present king has voluntarily surrendered about $t?oO,UU(> from his civil ' list for the benefit of the government. A Peaceable People. The Siamese are a peaceable people, but they are also intensely patriotic. The army system there is very similar to that of Germany, and each young man is i compelled to serve his three years in the standing army and then enters the reserves. None of the Siamese shirks this duty. A splendid standing army of ItO,(KX? men is maintained, well equipped and well drilled, and should be able to give a good account of itself. As an evidence of the consideration which the English and other foreigners have for the Siamese, extraterritorial courts, such as are maintained in China and other far eastern countries, are not maintained there. When a British subject commits an offense in Siam he is tried in a Siamese court, and under the laws of that land. Not a foreign soldier is maintained in Siam by any of the nations as a guard for the legation there, but the protection of the European representatives is left entirely to the Siamese police. The railroads in Siam are owned by the government, with the exception of a few short spurs. The government has found these roads a good investment, paying about 7 per cent. Slam is remarkably free from public debt, owing only about five million pounds, most of which was borrowed to construct railroads and other public improvements. Siam is primarily an agricultural country. and among her principal exports are rice, tea and hides. There are rich mineral resources in the country, many of which have not yet been developed, including oil, tin and gold. The country has a stable monetary system based on a gold standard. Tlie quantity of labor Is very limited in Slam, and. In fact, many Chinese laborers are employed in the rice fields and other Industry. There is no emigration from Siam. , Elk Grove art subject is handsome. Free. ?Advt.

President Taft's next message to Congress, which will go to that body within a few days, will deal with departmental and administrative affairs. The work of the economy and efficiency ommission will form an important part uf the message. This commission has been at work long enough to have reached conclusions that the President will wish to communicate to departmental heads and possibly to Congress. The President's tariff message will not be put into shape before some time icxt week, and may go over until right ifter the Christmas holidays. President Taft has accepted honorary membership in the Georgia Society of New York. This society appreciated some acts of the President friendly to the south and wishes to honor him.

Taximeter Gets Kentucky Senator. Senator Bradley of Kentucky watched a taximeter do him out of 10 cents at the White House yesterday. The Kentucky senator is probably the best patron of taxicabs and hacks in the city. He rides everywhere, pays what is asked of him and goes on about-his business. As he reached the White House yesterday in a taxicab he glanced at the taxirpeter and saw that it had registered $1. He didn't hear a little click a second after he had glanced at the instrument. "I see I owe you a dollar," said the senator to the chauffeur. "Here it is." "No, it'is $1.10," said the autocrat of the taxi. "Didn't you hear that little click just then?" "By gosh, I didn^t." declared the Kentuckian. "But here's the 10 cents, and I had better get away from here; that thing keeps on going 'round." The Iventuckian hurried away before the instrument could start again. Dolores?beautiful Elk Grove art subject, free.?Advt. 

TOTALS SEVERAL MILLIONS. ? Virginia Fisheries Largely Increase in Value According to Report. According to the annual report of the Virginia fisheries commission that state now ranks first in the fisheries industries of the country, surpassing the New England states, with their great cod and mackerel catching fleets. For the year ending September 1, 11?11. the gross income of the various fishing industries of Virginia, including the oyster industry, was $7,.VX>,00(?, and this does not include the catches of-mackerel, bluefish, trout and other deep sea fish off the coast, and which if added would increase the amount given above by several million dollars. The lafge increase in the value of the fisheries in Virginia is due much to the menhaden industry, in which a large fleet of big steamers is employed, and at which many thousand persons work during the fishing seaso'n. There is hardly a. town of any size on Chesapeake bay or at the mouth of the Potomac without its fish factory, and this business has practically all been developed within the past eight or ten years.

Those who would save Mattie Lomax, colored, from execution of the sentence to die on the scaffold at the District jail tne middle of February for the murder of her husband, will urge the probable mortal character of her present illness to President Taft in support of a plea for clemency and will present other reasons to induce executive clemency. Her condition is not such that she is likely to die before the time fixed for her execution. "Mrs. I.omax is holding up well." said Rev. John Roberts, her spiritual adviser, today. "She is not nervous, although she entertains but little hope of executive clemency." Mr. Roberts called to see Maj. Sylvester yesterday to get from the police department evidence in support of a claim that the unwritten law might have been invoked as a justtfication for her crime. Mrs. I.omax found a pocketbook on the table in her husband's room. When she asked her husband to whom it belonged, he replied: "That's my sweetheart's." At the trial of the case, it is stated, no reference was made to this pocketbook. The evangelist hopes he will be able to get enough information about such a pocketbook to incorporate it In a statement to be sent to the President. Another matter that may be brought before the President is a claim that while Lomax and his wife were living In a Missouri avenue house the husband pursued the 'wife with a razor and forced her to jump frorti a window. This was . not brought out at the woman's trial. Arthur Johnson, colored, sentenced to die with Mattie Lomax, hopes the Court of Appeals will come to his rescue and prevent or stay his execution.

SPECIAL MEETING CALLED. Important Questions Pending Before Columbia Country Club. Important problems are to be acted on at a special meeting of members of the Columbia Country Club, which will be held at the New Willard Hotel tomorrow evening. A constitutional amendment is to be brought up and probably adopted, providing for the admission of 200 associate members, of whom only from fifty to loo are to be admitted in the near future, the number remaining to be taken in as the board of governors may later decide. The associate members will not be required to subscribe to the organization fund, but they will not have the right to vote or hold office. The initiation fee and dues, however, are to be the same as the active members'. A proposition, framed by the executivefinance committee, is to be urged upon the club to permit the board of governors to recall the present issue of $100,000 of bonds, bearing 5 rer cent annually, with Messrs. Donaldson and Eynon as trustees, and to issue instead $10O,0>X) of bonds, bearing ?! per cent interest, payable semiannually, having the Union Trust ComIiany as trustees. The special report of the executive committee shows that the club, which occupies 128 acres on Connecticut avenue not far from Chevy Chase Lake, now has 4?7 active members, 36 non-resident members and 0 active special members, a total of 53t?.

CHOICE HORSETLESH ! Ft CAPITAL PEOPLE William F. Downey Buys Modern Farm to Meet a Growing Demand. t > . i ' - ' ' I . ' m wr v-1' > x B m K 1 Hito V WILIJAM F. DOWNEY. William F. Downey, who for many years has conducted a livery stable in Washington, has opened a horse sales department in connection with his stables. For some time Mr. Downey has been interested in breeding and raising of horses of fine stock, and recently he purchased the Falrview stock farm, located at Seminary station. Fairfax county, Va., only nine miles from Washington. This stock farm will add greatly to his facilities in maintaining in Washington a market for horses. Mr. Downey's new departure will increase the facilities offered Washingtonlans in the purchase of both riding and driving horses. The opportunity of seeing and trying out the horses, without ! traveling a considerable distance, is of- j fered. The interest in horseflesh and in riding and driving in the National Capital has l>een much increased by the establishment of the Washington Riding Club, and by the establishment on a firm basis of the National Capital Horse Show Association, which assures Washington a first-class horse show every year. ' Model Stock Farm. The Falrview stock farm, purchased by Mr. Downey, is announced as one of the best equipped and most fertile stock farm in Virginia, with modern stables containing 100 box stalls, artesian water, light, drainage and ventilation. Large exercising driveways, inside and around stables, paddocks, good fencing, abundance of spring and stream water, in every field, with trained grooms, veterinary service and every convenience for the care and training of horses. The many desirable features contained in this farm completes Mr. Downey's sales department by supplying a place where seasoned, acclimated and thoroughly trained horses may be obtained, and where horse owners desirous of summering and wintering their horses can have the advantage of a well conducted stock farm and stables. Mr. Downey has arranged with some of the largest horse breeders and shippers to be constantly supplied with horses for all purposes. A large stock of saddle and harness horses is now on exhibition at Mr. Downey's stables. 1022-28 L street. , Flowers and Plants for Christmas. Appropriate and pleasing gifts.

Special Correspondence of The Star. HYATTSVILL.B, Md.. December 1(5, 1911. Councilman J. B. Moore, representing the second ward of Mount Rainier, has tendered his resignation, and at a special meeting of the common council it was agreed that Victor F. Brooke of the government printing office should be chosen as his successor. This selection will probably be confirmed at the regular monthly meeting of the council Monday evening. It is understood that a number of citizens who signed a petition for the appointment of another citizen of the ward will protest, but under the charter the town council is authorized to fill vacancies of this kind, and the protest will probably be of no avail. The remains of Robert J. L. Davidson, who died Wednesday morning at his home on Franklin avenue,, were conveyed to Baltimore yesterday, and funeral services held in St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church South, of that city. Interment was made in Loudoun Park cemetery. Bright's disease caused death. Deceased is survived by his wife, who was Miss Emma Denton Godman of Baltimore, and two sons. He was employed in the office of the Hyattsville Gas and Electric Lighting Company. The oratorical contests which have been held under the direction of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in the Methodist Episcopal churches throughout Prinoe Georges county, during the last few months, were concluded Wednesday evening, at Bell's Church near Camp Springs. The program included discussions by six contestants, who had previously won medals in similar contests. These were the 'Misses Irene Allen, Florence Pyles, Eva Hardy, Mabel Everett, Mazie Carroll and Arthur McNler. The judges were Thomas H. Lyons* Dr. E T. Simpson and Rev. Mr. Ryarson. The medal was awarded Miss Hardy, the presentation being made by Rev. ?r. Ryarson. During the evening a musical and literary program was enjoyed, in which Mrs. Worcester Brlggs, Miss Esther Germany and Mr. Germany took part. State Senator Charles A. Wells says he will introduce a bill in the comina leais lature bonding Prince Georges county for i $100,000, to be apportioned among the four i road districts for the construction of permanent roadways. It is proposed to increase the tax rate 5 cents on each $100, and with an assessable basis of over $1".- < 000,000, sufficient money -can be raised to pay the interest on these bonds and create a sinking fund with which to retire ' the bonds. >
