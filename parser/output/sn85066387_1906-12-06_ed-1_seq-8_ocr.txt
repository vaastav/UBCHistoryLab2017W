PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT IN HIS VARIETY TT [s difficulUfor Californians to take seriously the portion of the I President's message touching on the Japanese. It is based on J misinformation, and. apparently, was conceived in a fit of bad temper. Mr. Roosevelt will on reflection realize that he has made a ?rave mistake. We cannot hold Secretary Metcalf free from blame. His knowledge of the situation is. or should be, com plete. It il^i 1^ obyiousMtliat for some reason he has failed to convey thait* knowledge to his chief. The President's impassioned eulogy of Japanese efficiency is wholly beside the question. It is doubtless admirable from a diplo matic point of view, but it has nothing to do with the case. The President's threat to enforce with the bayonet his hasty and un founded conception of the rights involved is merely absurd. These features of the message are mostly rhetoric and hasty temper, and might be disregarded as such, but when the President, even in his most excited mood., recommends the naturalization of Tapanese and their admission to full citizenship, we make the strong en protest. If the Japanese are fit subjects for Americanship, the same thing is equally true of the Chinese. The Japanese, as we find them on this coast, do not equal the Chinese in efficiency as work men, and are far less trustworthy. Shall we then adulterate our citizenship by an infusion of Asiatic coolies? The national body politic can assimilate the European of whatever grade, but never the Asiatic. They are aliens always, no matter what their civil status. The proposition to naturalize them is preposterous. ' All this outburst of august and Jovian wrath takes its rise in the fact that Fan Francisco, proceeding under the State laws, has segregated Asiatic students in special schools because it is deemed; inexpedient that adults should associate with little children in the intimate relations of school life. To call that "a crime against a fricndlv nation" is the language of nightmare. It is unfortunate that the President's intemperate utterances on the Japanese affair should have the effect of obscuring and throw ing into the background those many features of the document that merit the highest commendation as in the. line of enlightened prog ress. One of these deals with the more effective control of corpora tions. Of this the President says: It cannot too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown the impossibility of securing by the acticms of nearly haif a hundred different State Legislatures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corporations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one State. In some method, whether by a national license law or in other fashion, we must exercise, and that at an early date, a far more com plete control than at present over these great corporations — a control that will, among other things, prevent the evils of excessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure by each corporation of its stockholders and of its properties and business, whether owned directly or thru subsidiary or affiliated corporations. This will tend to put a stop to the securing of inordinate profits by favored individuals. -v' Mr. Roosevelt differs flatly with Harriman, who thinks the In terstate Commerce Commission has already too much power for the good of the railroads. The President believes those powers should be increased. , * * * Perhaps the most radical departure advocated by the President is the provision for "a graduated inheritance tax" and "a graduated income tax." The President, after beating about the bush a* good deal, finally indicates the nature and purpose ol the graduation where he says "the prime object should be to put a constantly increasing liurden on the inheritance of those swollen fortunes which it is cer tainly of no benefit to this country to perpetuate." In that view the tax would be in the first place punitive and only in a secondary sense a means of revenue. However this confusion of ethics and political economy may be viewed, it does not affect the President's recommendations as to an income tax. He asks Congress to enact a law in that regard in the hope that the Supreme Court may reverse or modify its, former decision on this subject. As the President appoints the Justices, the urgency of his language on this point seems to carry an intima tion that he knows that the court as now, or shortly to be, constituted will reverse the decision made by a majority of one. The income tax is, of course, an ideal means of revenue when it is needed. The question arises whether the Federal Government has not already ai The President indulges himself at length in characteristic but academic reflection on peace and war, as, for instance: - * A just war is in the long run far better for a nation's soul than the most prosperous peace obtained "by acquiescence in wrong or injustice. Moreover, tho it is criminal for a nation not to prepare for war, so that it may escape the dreadful consequences of being defeated in war, yet it must always be remembered that even to' be defeated in war may be far -.better than not to have fought at all. As has been well and finely said, a beaten nation is not necessarily a disgraced nation; but the nation or man is dis graced if the obligation to defend right is shirked. \u25a0 . • The President said all that better in the phrase, "Walk softly and carry a big stick." The message is full- of suggestion, as well as stuffed with words. It might be entitled "A Tractate on the Making of a Complete Ameri can." It begins with the application of the young idea on manual training and carries the citizen beyond the grave, where he ! is ex pected to surrender a generous share of his accumulations, partly for the good,of his country and in greater part as a sort of posthumous pur.ishmert for greed. The.r^es'sagc deals with considerations of in ternational etiquette without more wisdom than treatises on etiquette usually show. It informs the farmer that he has become a" pro-

Finally he touches with gingerly caution of approval §hawjs; plan for reform of the currency, because : this \ is; the. one subject in the whole range of human knowledge thaf Theodore Roosevelt is afraid of. * " ;\u25a0' God bless the President! THE 

PROFESSOR'S PERIL THE proud eminence as a matinee idol occupied with distinction and enjoyed with evident, zest \u25a0_ by Professor Henry^ Morse Stephens of the University of California is shrewdly threatened. The women's clubs are moving on him in force. They will be repelled only by unmasking a battery of bouquets. It appears that Professor Stephens/with more valor than dis cretion, has undertaken the dangerous work of writing a history, of his own times. Unterrified by the fate of .Froude and Forster, he will be the official historian of the San Francisco fire and earthquake. Al ready the ladies have begun to suspect him of being unfair to the fair. Mr. Stephens is operating the limelight, and the women's clubs are pur sued by doubts and fears that the historian prejudiced in favor of the unfair sex. has relegated them to the dark corners, or, it may. be, has elbowed them off the stage altogether. Doubtless the Esquire Professor,! f tackled with the ball in his stout arms, will shelter himself with polite, magniloquenj: phrases be hind "the truth of history." The word seems familiar, and /comes trippingly like Falstaff's honor. What is this truth of history? Who hath it ? Him who died o' Wednesday, or wait; Thursday?.s \u25a0 it; Thursday ?. Will it set your hat on straight; or darn the^hole in your stocking? One seems to remember the remark of the sage— not Stephens — "and as for history, we know that to be lies." We venture to offer a plea mv favor of gratitude! Professor Stephens owes a cartload of bouquets to the women's clubs, and the debt is about due. Cast your bouquets upon the -waters and they will return to you when they come handy. Otherwise it ;will be for you like Thackeray's suburban lady who ventured on an unhappy arid ill-fated Shakespearean excursion, and thus was her lament: "How sharper than a thankless tooth it is to have a serpent child." Which, being freely translated to the language of a vulgar generation, means "twenty-three for you."

Poor of England and France Face Serious Conditions 

ENGLAND is :<m the verge of a marked Increase in .the cost of \u25a0 living, according to a report re ceived at "Washington from Con sul Hamm of Hull. There is a simultaneous shortage in several kinds of household provisions, , and the result * that prices are al ready on the rise, and by Christmas they will have reached unusual heights. Butter and cheese are two of the chief articles in which there is a shortage, and the reason for the shortage is found in the continued drought of the past few months, the effect being felt not only in England, but in butter producing countries like France. Can ada and , Australia. 'Apart from this, many farmers are. giving: up making butter and cheese, finding it more prof itable to sell their milk. The result of these things Is that there is. a scar city of both butter and cheese: At Christmas butter will cost 4 cents per pound more than at present, and cheese will increase by 2 cents a pound. .A leading London .firm of provision deal ers states that prices, are even now well advanced.
