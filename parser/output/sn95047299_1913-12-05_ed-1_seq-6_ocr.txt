George Washington's surveying done in 1751 when, as a lad of 19, he ran lines with chain and compass through the wilderness of the Virginia hills tor Lord Fairfax, has been checked up by government sur veyors who have just made their re ports and who found the work of the immortal patriot perfect. Washington, running his lines with primitive instruments and bon fires on hill tops, left monuments and boun daries to which technlcaly educated surveyors, using high power transits and all the refined and accurate meth ods of modern instruments, allow they have been able to find no variation. From the top of Middle mountain In the Massanutten range the old Fair fax line may be distinguished without the use of instruments and can be fol lowed by boundary fences dating from the earliest days and by blocks of timber which come up for the county lines and stand out like squares upon a checker board. Down across the valley of the south fork of the Shenan doah as far as the eye can distinguish the line shows plainly. Washington's survey blazes cut into the trunks of trees and long grown over have been rediscovered and all are several feet higher from the ground than those the woodsmen of today would make. Some authorities contend Washington made them from the saddle with a long handled ax. The government has been retracing the old lines because it is buying land through the territory which they run for the new Appalachian forest re serve. Sultan Loses Suit In New. York. New York.

BAIL ALLOWED ZELAYA Former Ruler of Nicaragua Is Held on the Charge of Murder. New York. Jose Santos Zelaya, the former president of Nicaragua, arrest ed in bed at midnight on charges of having committed murder in Nicara gua, was held without bail for exam inatlon. Pending the arrival of a re quest for extradition to Nicaragua, he was remanded to prison. General Zelaya was arrested as fugitive from justice on complaint of Roger B. Wood, an assistant United States attorney. Mr. Wood charged that a warrant for Zelaya's apprehen sion for murder had been issued Nicaragua, but did not name the al leged victims. It was said, however, that they were two countrymen slain twelve years ago and that the death of Leroy Gannon and Leonard Groce, Americans slain in Nicaragua, in 1909, in an uprising against the Zelaya re gime, had nothing to do with General Zelaya's arrest. Zelaya was arrested at midnight in the apartment of Washington S. Val entine. He made no effort to escape and went uncomplainingly to the po lice station, asking them to give him what conveniences they could. Picked His Wife, From 400 Women New York. Ernest W.

In view of the fact that the neighboring city of Lakeland is test ing the validity of the election just held to secure a commission, It has been decided to wait and not urge the matter for a time. Owing to the fact that Gov. Park Trammell has been called to Wash ington on important public business and will be detained there and that no meeting of the board of pardons can be held without the governor's presence and participation, it has been ordered that the next regular meeting of the board of pardons be postponed one week, that is to say from Decem ber 2 until December 9.

UNVEILED FIRST OF YEAR. Florida's Memorial to Man Who vented Artificial Ice Nearly Completed. Tallahassee. Florida's contribution to the national hall of fame ln the Capitol at Washington, the handsome Grecian marble statue of Dr. John Corrie, the man who invented artificial Ice, and cooled the fevered brow of his patients in Southern summer by his genius, will be unveiled early in January. The statute Is nearly completed, will be early in December, when C. Adrian Pillar of Jacksonville, the artist and iculptor who made the model and was awarded the work after severest com petition, finishes the details of feature xnd dress for the statue. In less than two years after It was jeriously considered, this statue will be unveiled; and in the meantime the companion piece, Gen. Kirby-Smith Florida's great soldier-scholar, has oeen hanging fire for nearly ten years, j-our commissions have been ap pointed, and "only one had any funds o go on. The last legislature appro priated 10,000 for the Kirby-Smlth ttatue for the hall of fame In Wash ngton, and required the appointment f three commissioners, two to be Confederate veterans and the third to be the sons of veterans. Gov. Park Trammell has named two. who have accepted the tfust, and he named one son of a veteran, who efused. It. has been six months now -inco the legislature made the appro priation available, and there Is not a commission yet. . If it takes as long relatively to fur nish the work as it has to get this far the Kirby-Smith statue' will probably be unveiled some time in 1925. It is understood that the governor takes the position that the commission should be distributed over the state, and Is waiting to get some one to ac cept, from the western part of Flor ida; while the advocates of doing something at once believe at lease two of the commission should be from near together places, so they could meet occasionally at less expense than will attach to a gathering from such great distances. They state, that one com missioner now lives in Jacksonville, ne in Bartow, and they believe that he third man should be appointed from somewhere near one or equi distant to both places.

If they had stopped at Calla han they could liave grown, any ol the crops raleed In South Florida and have gotton a yield equal to eny ol that section ft and saved the ' excess freight which would have been a good profit oil their crops. ;'The Callahan district la especially adapted to growing Irish potatoes.
