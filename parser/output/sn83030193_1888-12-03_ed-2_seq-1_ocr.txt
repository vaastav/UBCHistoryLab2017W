Littlowood and Albert Bluet Walk Off si ' the Championship. ; The race at Madison Square Garden was no sooner completed Saturday night than the question of another race to brought up, and 7 it will bo advocated vigorously until it is ' Bottled and another tedious strugglo for the ; championship ie ended. The next race, libwevor, will be run under 1 different conditions, and perhaps under an I entirely 'different management. The men ' who wero leaders in last week's run have Bug- Bested that they arrange for a race themsolves, hire a man to act as their manager and thus secure for themsolves all; tho receipts, less t necessary expenses. i Manager O'Brien Is planning for a race to be run in February, and is In favor of divid ing the contestants into two classes. Tho ; beat men, sueh as Littlewood, Albert, Herty i and Bowell, to put up $1,000.' and I I the men who enter the second class to pay (' 9200. Tho winnor in tho first class would take the sweepstakes besides his share of tho gate receipts. I Ex-Champion Jimmy Albert and Champion Iilttlewpod want to meet, but neither will .issue a formal challenge until they are advised ' of the arrangements for another race that will allow them to settle the matter of superiority. If the arrangements suit them they will bo content to enter with others and walk it out. I Herty was the freshest man on the track J Saturday night, but bad ho attempted to catch Littlowood, tho plucky Englishman would have been up and going at a rapid rate. Littlowood and Herty are both in for more races, 'and pedestrians agree that it would have been poor policy for Little wood, to make his record so high that even he him self would have a hard tusslo to boat it. At the wind up of tho raoe Littlewood had a blister on his right foot as largo as a silver dollar and a badly Inflamed left knee. Bo had been running, unmindful of tho foot, but his knee made hint limp somowhat. lie refused an alcohol bath and sleep until bo retired from the Garden. Ho only slept sev enteen hours throughout tho week. There were mistakes in the scores given to the press last week. Idttlowood's correot rec ord U as follows: First day, 123 miles a laps: second day, OS miles 5 laps; third day, 103 miles i fourth day. Hi miles; fifth day, 103 mlleB 1 lap: sixth day, 83 miles 1 lap. Total C23 miles 0 laps. The pedstrians who covered over 1525 miles at Madison Bquare Garden in last week's race gath ered in IUchard K. Fox's office at noon to-day, to receive the money due them from the race. There were ten in all, and they showed np in good oondltlon. Except for slight drowsiness on the part of one or two, they did not appear to be much tho worso for their long walk. Manager O'Brien stated that the management hadclearedaboutJl'J.OOOfrom therace. Tho gross recopts amounted to flf,not!.60, outside of the money taken in for the benefit of the man agement in the rental of reserrod seats and privileges. i Fifty per cent, of the abovo amount, or $0,003.26 was tho sum to which tho ten leading t walkers wero entitled, less $302. CO expenses. The, amount distributed was tn.aoo. 76. Littlewood said ho supposed ha was to receive 60 per cent, of this amount if ho won, but it appears that this was to be allowed him in case only six succeeded in walking over tho 5B5 miles. , It was decided to divide the amount due the ten men into amonnts of the ratio of 40, 18. 13. O, 6. 6, 4, 3. s and 1, from Littlewood down to Mason. This equals 100 per cent or tho whole amount. The distribution was delayed three hours, and it was a o'clock befnro tho men were paid off.

The second session of tho Fiftieth Congress convoned at noon to-day. When Doorkeeper Nichols attempted to clear tho floor of the House at 11. 10 this morn ing he found it a difficult task. The seats, alsloj and cloak-rooms were filled with old members, new mombers and men who would like to bo members. The Speaker called the House to order with his little gavel. There wero flowers on tho desk of Mr. Ran dall, of handsome Feter Paul Mahoney, of Brooklyn; of High-Tariff. Bowden, pf Penn sylvania, and a number of other members. As the gavel fell the Chaplain of the Houso rose and made a short but earnest prayer, after which tho Speaker 'announced the busi ness might proceed, and tho second session of the Fiftioth Congress was begvn. In the Senate the grave and reverend slgnofs shook hands warmly, and then with thir accustomed dignity, proceeded to busi ness. President pro torn Ingalls looked straight er, thinner and more closely buttoned np than over, and his voice, as he bade the Senators welcome, had the old metallic ring and short intonation that has often roused tho Senate from semi somnolence. Tho Senate took a recess at 12.47 to 1.80, and the Houbo irom 1 to 1.30. Both branches reassembled promptly. President Cleveland's annual message was received and read. He begins by a reference to the fact that 'with the expiration of the present session of Congress tho first century of our Con stitution will be completed. In words simple and eloquent he reaffirms his position on the subject of tariff reform. " It is tho people's cause," he writes, and "should never bo compromised. " Our relations with Great Britain ore frankly discussed, and reasons for tho dis missal of Lord Sackville briefly recounted. Not a word is said on the subject of civil service reform.. Some of tho striking sentences from the, message follow i " We dlneover that! the fortunes realized by nr manufacturer are do longer solely the leirnrd of sturdy Industry and enlightened foresight, bat that they result from the discriminating- favor of the fJorernment, and are largely built upon undue exactions from the matses of our people." " Corporations which should be the rnre fully restrained creatures of the ln.tr and the servants of the people are fast becoming- the people's masters.' The cause for which the battle I waged Is comprised witlifa lines clearly and dis tinctly deOned. It should never be compro mised. It Is the people's cause." "The people must still be taxed for the support of the flovernment nnder the operation of the Tariff Laws." ."Communism Is a hateful thing. But the Communism of combined wealth and capital Is not less dan gerous then the Communism of op pressed poverty and toll." s "He mocks the people who proposes that the Government shall protect the rich and that they In tnrn will protect the laboring poor." Hore are the important parts of tho mos. sago in full i TV M Contrtu tlli United Slain ; As you assemble for the dlschargo of the duties you have assumed as tho representatives Of a free and generous people, your meeting Is marked by an interesting and impressive inci dent, With the expiration of the prosent ses sion of the Congress, tho first century of our constitutional exlatcncu as a nation will be com pleted. Our survival for ono hundred years is not suf ficient to assuro us that wo no longer have dan gers to fear in tho maintenance, with all its promised blessings, of a government founded upon tho freedom of the people. . The time rather admonishes us to sobci ly inquire whether in the past we havo always closely kept in the course of safety, and whether wo have before ns a way plain and clear which leads to hsppi- When the experiment of our Government was Undertaken, tho chart adopted forourguidanco was tho Constitution, Depsrturo from the lines there laid down is failure. It is only by a strict adherence to the direction they inmcate and by restraint within tho limitations they, fix, that wo can furnish proof to tho world of the fitness of tho American people for self-government The equal and exact inittce of which webpast as the underlying principle of our institutions should Bet be coaflned to the relations of onr eUlaens to each other. The Government i itself fa under bead t the Aswneaa people that la the I WcJf of " functions and powers it will deal with the ody of our citizens In a manner scru pulously honost and fair and absolutely Just. It hasaa-reed that. American cltUonshlp shall be the only credential necessary to Justify tho claim P.' finality before tho law, and that no condition lu life shall ulvo rl.o to discrimination in the treatment of tho peoplo by their Government .The citizen of onr itepnbllo in its early days rigidly insisted upon full roompllaneo with tho lettor of this bond, and saw stretching out be fore him a dear, field for iridlyiausl endeavor. Ills tnbuto to tho support of Ids Government was measured by tho cost of its economical maintenance, ami ho nas scenro in tho enjoy ment of tho remaining recompenso of his steady and contonted toil. In thoso days the frugality of tho peoplo was stamped upon their Govern ment, and was enforced by tho free, thonchtf ul andintolllgont suffrage of the citlren. Combi nations, monopolies and aggregations of capi tal were cither avoided or sternly regulated and restrained.,. Tho romp and slitter, of govern ments less free offered no temptation and pre sented np delusion to tho plain people who, side by side, in friendly competition wrought for tho ennoblement end dignity of man, for tho soln tlorr of tho problem of freo government, and for the achievement of the grand destiny awaiting tho land which God had given them. toe rooa taxed ron tub men. A century has pissed. Our cities are tho abid ing places of wealth and luxury; our manufac tories yield fortunes novcr dreamed of by tho fathers of tho Ilepublic; onr buslnoss men are madly striving in tho raco for riches, and im mense aggregations of capital outrun the imagi nation in the magnitude of their nndertakincs. Wo view with pride and satisfaction this bright picture of our country's growth and prosperity, vthlle only a closer scrutiny develops a sombre snsding. upon moro csref ul Inspection wo find thoiwcalth and luxury of our cities mingled with poverty and wretchedness and unrcmuneratlvo toil. A crowded and constantly increasing urban population suggests tho impoverishment of rural sections and discontent with agricultural pur suits. The farmer's son, not satisfied with his father's simple and laborious life, joins the eager chase for easily acquired wealth. We discover that the fortunes realised by onr manufacturers aro no longer solely tho reword of sturdy Industry and enlightened foresight, but that they result from th6 dlacrimiuatinn; favor of tho Government, and aro largely built upon undno exactions from the masses of our People. The gulf between employers and the omployod is constantly widening and classes are rapidly forming, one, composing tho very rich and powerful, while in another aro found the tolling poor. As wo view the achievements of aggregated capital, wo discover tho existence of trusts, combinations and monopolies, while tho clmen is struggling far in tho rear or is trampled to death beneath an iron heel. Corporations, which should bo the carefully restrained creatures of tho law and the servants of tho people, are fast becoming tho people's masters. Bull congratulating ourselves upon tho wealth and prosperity of our country, and compla cently contemplating every incident of change inseparable from these conditions, it is our duty as patriotio citizens to inquire, at the present stage of our progress, how tho bond of the Gov ornment made with tho peoplo has been kept and performed. Instoad of limiting the tribute drawn from onr citizens to tho necessities of its economical ad ministration, the Government persists in exact ing from tho substance of tho peoplo millions which unapplied and useless lie dormant in its Treasury. This flagrant injustico and this breach of faith and obligation add to extortion the danger attending the diversion of tho cur rency of the country from tho legitimate chan nels of business. Under the same lawB by which these results aro produced, the Government permits many millions moro to be added to -the cost of tho living of our, people and to be taken irom our consumers, which unreasonably swell the profits of a small but powerful minority. tub TAiurr a ntinpsN to the. masker, The people must still bo taxed for the support of the Government under the operation of tariff laws. But to the extent that the mass of our citizens are inordinately burdened beyond any useful tmblio purpose, and for the benefit of a favored few, the Government, under pretext of an exercise of its taxing, powor, enters gra tuitously into partnership with those favorites, to their advantage and to the injury of a vast majority of our people. This is not equality beforo tho law. The existing situation is injurious to the health of our entire body-politic. It stillos, in those for whoso benefit it is permitted, all patriotio lovo of country, and substitutes in its place selfish greed and grasping avarice. Devo tion to American citizenship for its own sake and for what it should accomplish as a motive to onr nation's advancement and the happiness of all our people, is displaced by the assumption that the Government, instead of being tho em bodiment of equality, Is but an Instrumentality through which especial and individual advan tages aro to bo gained. The arroganco of this assumption is uncon cealed. It appears in tho sordid 'disregard of all but personal interests, in the refusal to abato for the benefit of others one iota of selfish ad alltage, and in combinations to perpetnato such advantages through efforts to control leg islation and improperly inlluenco the suffrages of the people. ThOKrlevancoB of those not included within tho circle of these beneiicisries, when fully ualizod, will surely arouso irritation and discon tent. Our farmers, long-snffering and patient, struggling in tho raco of life with the liardest and most unremitting toll, will not fail to see, in spite of misrepresentations and misleading fal lacies, that they aro obliged to accept such prices for their produots as are fixed in foreign markets where they compete with the farmers of the world; that their lands aro declining in value while their debts increase, and that without compensating favor they aro forced by tho ac tion of the Government to pay, for the, benefit, of others, such enhanced prices for tho things ther need that tho scanty teturns of their labor fail to furnish their support or leavo no margin for accumulation. Our workingmen, enfranchised from alldelu sionsand no longer frightened by the cry that their wages are endangered by a just revision of onr tariff laws, will reasonably demand through snen revision steadier , employment, cheaper means of living in their homes, freedom for themsolves and their ohildreu from tho doom of perpetual servitude, and an open door to their advancement beyond tho limits of a laboring class. Others 'of our citizens whose comforts and expenditures aro mcasnred by moderate sal arics and fixed incomes will insist upon tho fair ness and justice of cheapening the cost of neces saries for themselves and their families. A 

MENACE TO r BACK. When to the selfishness of the beneficiaries of unjust discrimination under our laws thero shall be added tho discontent of those who suffer from such discrimination, wo will realize the fact that tho heneflcQiit purposes of ourO ovcrnment, de pendent upon tho patriotism and contentment of our people, aro endangered. Communism Is a hateful thing and a monaco to peace and organized government. But the communism of combined wealth and capital, the outgrowth of ovcrwconlng cupidity and sel fishness, which insiduously undormlnes the Jus tice and integrity of freo institutions, is not less dangerous than tho communism of op pressed poverty and toil which, exasperated by Injustice and discontent, attacks with wild dis order tho citadel of rule. Ho mocks tho people who proposes that the Government shall protect tho rich and that they In tnrn will care for tho laboring poor. Any intermediary between tho peoplo and their Gov ernment, or the least delegation of the caro aod protection tho Government owes to tho humblest citizen in the land, makes the boast of freo in stitutions a glittering delusion and tho pro tended boon of American citizenship a shame less imposition. A hint and sensible rovlslqn of our tariff laws should bo made for tho relief of those of our countrymen who sutler under present condi tions. Buouarowsiou should rocclvo tho sup ,port of all who loo that justicq and equality duo to Arncrican citizenship, of all who realize that in this justice and equality our Government finds its strength and its power to pro tect tho citizen and his property, of all who believe that the contonted competeuco and comfort of many accord hotter .with the spirit of our institutions than coIobssI fortune unfairly gathered in the hands of a few, of all who appreciate that tho forbearance and fraternity among our peoplo, which recognize the valuo of every American in terest, are the surest guaranty of our national progress, and of, all who desire to see the products of American skill and. ingenuity in every markot of the world with a resulting restoration of American commerce. rizcrjuiTT or bvexub bkdeo-tio.

They aroso up in arms and protested against such an act of cruelty. But Mr. Han kinson, Suporlntondont of tLo Bocloty for tho Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, calmly announced that tho Sooiety approved of the act. ' ' If the animal is mentally distressed.

Ho was shadowed to a boardlng-honso in Wost Tenth street by two of Inspector Byrues's de fectives. Dr. Twomblety was missed from his ususl haunts in London last week, and was tracked to Havre, France.

His Body Placed by the Side or tho Railroad Track. DI4 lie Meet Ills Death nt the Honda of a Jenlftus nival ? A big piece of brown wrapping paper, be tween the two rails of tho track over which tho trains used to ma into Brooklyn from Manhattan Beaoh last summer, covored a big circle of partially congealed blood this morning, marking tho spot whero Gardoner Patrick Kelly was struck down and murdered lato on Saturday night. There is absolutely no olua to the mail or men who oommittod tho deed. From present appearances robbery teems to havo been tho motive which prompted tho deed, and tramps aro snspectod, but later developments may show that Kelly was mur dered by a man. Jealous of the attentions which ho was paying to n young woman re siding in Brooklyn. Kelly was about thlrty.flve years old, a very big man and worked for James F. Lott, of the village of Farkvllle in New Utreobt. He bad charge of the conservatory. Ho lived in tho greenhouse with two men named Carey and Pendergast, who worked under his orders. On Saturday afternoon Kelly and his fol low.workmon went to Brooklyn. Kelly bad somo flowers to dispose of. Ho sold his last lot to Florist James Mallon at tho corner of Fulton and Willoughby streets fir IC.60. Pendergast was going to call on a sister of bis with Carey, and they invited Kelly to go with them. He refused, saying i "I must go back to tho greenhouse, boys, and get my fires in condition." Beforo separating the throe men went into a dry-goods storo on Fifth avenue and Six teenth street, whore Kelly purchased some underwear. That was the last time bis two companions ever saw him allvo. They parted company in front of the storo door. The men rushed to Mr. Lott's home and arousod him and his son. Thoy notified tho polloo authorities in overy direction. It was not until about noontimo yesterday, how ever, that tbo body was removed to the Morgue. Keeper Magulre found 68 cents in his olotb. ing, nn old pipe and the box of matches and some old papers. When found on tbo track hiai pockets wore turned inside out and a ton-oent piece was found near by, showing that whoever had murdered him bad robbed him. whether to throw suspicion on some one else or not remains to be seen. AUthe Parkvilleitea say that tramps have been very scarce in that vicinity this winter. Thomas Itonan, who works for Dan Dun ley, a botel-koener in Parkvilio, told an EvEHiNQ 'Wobi.d 'reporter this morning that he thought Kellv had been murderod by a rival for some lady's affections. " Thoir rivalry is an old story about hero," he said, " but I have only been here two months, and never heard tho names men. tionod. The girl usod to work In the same bouse with Kelly,' he concluded. Kolly took the 0 o'clock train on the Culver route for Parkvilio. arriving tboro within ten minutes, in company with another gardener named Matt liyan, a resident of Parkvilio. They went into E. YV. Vonderlieth's saloon right opposito the platform at which the trains stop and had a drink of beer each. Kelly paid for it with a ten-cent piece. Thero were no sttangers or suspicious persons about the barroom. Before leaving Kelly said i " Give me a box of matches V" A paper of common sulphur ones wero passed to him and he langhingly remarked t "I guess I'vo got n cent about me." Ho fumbled a little and then pasad over the copper. Ryan and be then went out together. Thoy llvod in opposite directions, and liyan says they separated on the corner. Neither of tbem were at all under the in fluence of liquor. Kelly was never known to be so. He was in Mr. Lott's employment for about seven years. That gentleman told an Evbnino Worn,!) reporter to-day that in all that time be had novcr known Pat to bo un der the inlluenco of liquor or to keep late hours. It was about 0.80 when Ryan left Kelly, Tho latter had to walk along tho Manhattan Beach Railroad track for about tivo minutes to reach bis destination. Ho had almost reached it; In fact, was within five feet of a fence over which ho bad to climb to reach a short cut to tho grcenhouso, when he was attacked. From tho appearance of his wonnds it seems as if be was struck with an axe from behind. Corey and Pendergast, going home about 12.10 A. M. yesterday; stumbled over his dead body. 1 lo lay with his face turned upward, his shoulders resting on the last rail. There wero flvo terrible wounds on the head. Tho forehead was crushed in at loast six inches, and bono, blood and flesh mixed together in a sort of pulp. Another gash disfigured tho head on tho left sldo, ono on the ncok and two on tho right side. Kelly wore a mustache and all-round whia. kcrs. His faco was mashod right in down to the lino of tho mustache, and only for the clothing he wore it would bavo been impossi ble to recognize him. Mr. Lott said that he bad beard of Kelly's namo in connection With one or two young women. "Did either of thorn over live in tho sauie houso with him f " asked the roporter. " Yes, one of them used to work here whilo KaIIv tilil. Hlio is livinrr somoirhprn tti Brooklyn now." Mr. Lott says he does not beliovo jealousy caused the murder. Ho intends to cull a meeting of tho citizens of Prkille and vi clnlty and bavo thorn adopt somo measures to hunt tho murderer down. Dr. Bhcpard hold an autopsy on the body at tbo Moreno in Willouphby street, Brook lyn, at noon to.day.

Illnghntn. A Third avenue car was hailed by two men at tho corner of Hoster street a fow mlnntos before 1 o'clock this morning. Walking, or rather staggering, bctweon tho two men was a protty blondo of perhaps nine teen years of ago. As tho car stoppod tho men put her aboard and bid her "Good night." Tho woman was in a drunken stupor and the conductor led her inside tho oar and seatod her in tho corner. As the car sped along uptown tbo young woman attracted attention. The other pas sengers in tho car were struck by ber beauty. She was rather tall and well developed, and had a wealth of short, curling, golden tresses, a full, round face and a pair of bright blue eyes, which, on account of the liquor sbo had drank, were somewhat glassy. Sbo wore a green oloth dross of fashionablo cut, a handsome seal.plnsh saoquo and a black velvet bonnet, out of Which pcoped lemon tips. The conductor kept his eye upon the young woman, and as tbo car nearod tho corner of Fourth street the girl nulled a small vial from her, pocket and slowly placing it to ber lips, drank its contonts, Tbo conductor ran inside the car and grabbed the young woman's arm. A he did so. bo smelted carbolio acid, and it flashod across his mind that auioide bad been attempted. He stopped tbo car, and amid the shouts, threats and kicks of the unfortunate, she was bandod over to Officer Thomas J. Diamond, of the Fourteenth Precinct: The officer hastily carried her to the Fifth street station houso, and an ambulance waa summoned. Tbo young woman refused to give her namo, bnt'on being searched a letter was found from U. Bingham, of 209 Sixth avenue, addressed "Miss Alice Chester." Ambulance-Burgeon Llndsey, of Bollevua Hospital, arrived, and upon seeing tho sick woman, recognized hor as the girl who had tbreo times previously attempted to maka away with herself once by jumping from tho Tombs balcony, once by throwing herself in front of an Elevated train and tho last time by jumping from tho Chanties and Correction boat, at the foot of East Twenty-sixth streot. After administering temporary antidotes the girl was taken to Bellovue, arriving at 3.05 a. m. Sho wai at onco put to bed in ward 81. i Dr. Lambert attempted to use the stomach-pump, but tho girl kicked, screamod and scratched to such an extent that he was' compelled to force tho tube down through her nose. The physician worked until i o'olock and retired, but at S o'clock ho was summoned and found bis patient in a state of collapse. By skilful treatment be brought ber out all right and administered drugs which put her to sleep. She was so violent that it was boo essary to tie ber down to the bed. At noon the girl was still asleep. Her face was flushed and her lips, inside of her month, were horrible scars, showing where the fiery' potion had taken effect. IDs expected that sho will recover, although in a very danger ous condition. II. Bingham, to whom tho letter found in the girl's possession v,as addressed, was not in his office at No. 208 Sixth avenue when Tub Evknwo Would man called, but people in the neighborhood said that two girls answer-, lng the description were constant callers at Bingham's office. Thoy were the exact counterpart of eaoh othor in looks end in manner of dressing. They pretended to be sisters. It was also said that ono or other of the girls often spont the nlgbt in the building, and that on one ocoasion one of the girls came thereafter midnight, and finding the front door locked, had deliberately climbed in the front window. A policeman followed her, but no arrest was made. This is the fourth time that the girl has at tempted to make away with herself. About tho mlddlo of September tbo girl created a sensation by trying to throw herself in front of a train on tho elevated railroad, but suc ceeded in escaping arrest. A few weoka later she was arrested for dis orderly conduct, and after being sentoced to a term on the Island, sho tried to leap over tho balcony of the Tombs. When sbo reached tho steamboat running to Blackwell'a Island, she squirmed out or tho clutches of her jailers and jumped into the East River. After kicking and fighting she was finally dragged ashore and taken to Bellevue Hos pital. After being resuscitated sbo was sent to tho Tombs again, and it was supposed by the hospital authorities that she was "doing throe months." A friend of Brigham's professed to know nothing of the girl, but when closely ques tioned admitted a slight acquaintance. Ho said that her real name was Catharine Quinn and that she resided with ber family in Ono Hundred and Twentieth street. To the hospital authorities the girl gave her namo as Alico Chester and her address as 131 East Ninety-eighth street. She said she was a milliner by occupation. FIRST WITH THE MESSAGE.
