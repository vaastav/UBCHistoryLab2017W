Ratification of tho Subscription to the Air-Line Bailroad. We congratulate the County of Greenville, and this whole region of oountry, on I l.o action of tho meeting on Saledoy.? The whole Argument may be reduced to a few words All admit the importance of the Air-Line Uailrosd. If it is built, we gain vastly by the County subscription; if it should fail, we ahall have nothing to pay, and will have (he satisfaction of having done our duty in endeavoring to secure it. We thii.k it has been shown that the County will in no event be railed ?poo lo p?/ more than two years' interest on the subscription before the Slock will be at par, and ibe dividtnda will always pay it afterwards, and in all proaMlity yield a clear income to the people independent of all the incidental advantages of the Koad.
