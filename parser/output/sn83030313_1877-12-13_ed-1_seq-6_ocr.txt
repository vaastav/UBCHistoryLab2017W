Caatoui llouau Noml?atio??- A NarlUyinf Rrialt for IHr. Iluyea* The two nominations made by the Presi dent lor suppluntiug the present Collector and Naval Officer, whose terms have not ex pired, wero rejected in the executive session of the Sonute yesterday by a majority so un expectedly lurgo that Mr. Hayes will be likely to think twice betore he repents the experi ment. The nays were 31 against 25 yeas, mak ing a majority of six against the 1'resient. This is as mortilyiug for the administration as the fall of Plevna is for the Turks. Mr. Merritt, who was nominated to till a vacancy in the office of Surveyor of Customs, was confirmed without a division. Mr. Roose velt has no reason to feel humiliated at his rejection. Had he been nominated to till a vacancy he would probably have been con firmed. It must be said lor him that he did not seek the office. Ho was urged and almost conscripted into the service of the administration in the hope that his personal respectability would turn the scale against Collector Arthur. The mer chants of New York, who take little interest in the squabbles of political factions, will be very well satisfied that Mr. Arthur re tains the office whose duties ho bus dis charged with faithful efficiency. 1 here was no good reason why the government and the mercantile community should lose the advantage of his experience. It would have taken a new collector some time to acquire Mr. Arthur's ready familiar ity with the duties of his office, and even then the Custom House would not be better administered than it is at present. W e congratulate Mr. Arthur that the Senate has so just an appreciation of the value of his services and of his pop ularity with the New York merchants, none of whom has ever uttered a breath of cen sure against any part of his conduct. The Senate has done its duty in letting well enough alone. It had no moral right to subordinate the question of personal fit ness to the exigencies of a political quarrel. It is too early to indulge in conjectures as to the effect of this mortifying defeat on the future courso of the administration. It may, or it may not, lead to a dissolution of the present Cabinet. Curtain it is that the President has been badly advised, and if he is wise he will select better advisers. Having been led into a bog and sunk up to bis neck by following a will-oi-the-wisp, he would do well to select a different lantern to guide his footsteps. Rut President Hayes is a slow man, and it may take him several days to realize the situation. Mr. Hayes can blame only himself and his immediate counsellors for the position in which he finds himself. It is not his Southern policy that has brought him iuto this predicament; for in spite of some faults of execution that policy is right in itself and has been hon estly and consistently maintained. It is mainly his vacillating, crooked and insincere course in relation to the civil service that has enabled his opponents to win this signal triumph, llis civil service methods have been*ill-judged, tricliv and deceitlul. He was weak and vain enough to set out with a parade of high-flown pre tensions. There wab a challenging air of "bounce" and self-assumption which raised doubts of his good sense and solidity of churacter and displayed an unconsciousness of obstacles which was really ludicrous. Some allowance was properly made for his inexperience, and a great deal more ought to be made for the had advice by which he was misled. After having started with boastful flourishes, offen sive to good taste, as to the mighty things he was going to do in reforming the civil service he saw the necessity of trans luting his lofty professions into acts, and so issued his famous order forbidding the offi cers of the government to take an active part in politics. It was a surprising fatuity which supposed that such an order would not provoke opposition. Its fatally weak poiut luy in tbo tact that it was an order which he had no power to enforce. It might have done to issue such an order in the bygone days, when the Pres ident had an absolute power of removal. Rut for a President fettered with the Tenure of Office law, which permits of no re moval without the consent of the Senate, it was imprudent, because a President always loses influence by attempting, at the outset of his administration, things which ho cannot perform. Rut this was not the worst. When the order was openly defied in a conspicuous instance | the President hesitated and temporized. He quailed beioro opposition. Alter having com mitted himself so lar he should have gone on. He should have promptly exerted the power of suspension which lie possessed, and at least have vindicated his courage and determination. Rut ho seemed paral yzed by the situation. He feared the effect on the elections, and kept wavering, weakly trying to save his credit by giving out what lie was going to do at some future time to make his order respected. Rut from that time forth his resolution gradually crumbled away, and atter the disastrous Ohio election he kept explaining away the morning of his order until there was not enough of it lelt to be worth the dignity of a passing men tion in his annual Message. He made other and worse mistakes. While setting up boastfully as tlio civil service rc lormer par na-tllrnce he has constuntty em ployed the federal patronage to promote his own political and personal objects in disre gard of the first principles of civil service reform. This caused moro distrust than his want of courage and vigor in standiug by the unfortunate order. It has always been a leading tenet ol' the civil service reform ers thut officers should rctuili their places so long as they are faithful and efficient. This cardinal doctrine was practicully re nounced by the President when he under took to remove an excellent officer like Collector Arthur for no other reason than a wish to build up a personal purty of his own in New York. 01 course, this was not the pretext, but no intelligent man doubts thut it was the motive. Mr. Hayes has beeu signally and deservedly foiled, and nobody should regret that so transparent u humbug as his civil service "bounce" is exploded. Mr. llaycs bus now an opportunity to profit by his experience. He can begin the civil service reform anew, with more sin cerity, less bumptiousness and by practioul methods. The roforin is not defeated unless be chooses to liavo it so. A hollow sham is swept away, but he is no less bound than he was in the outset to re . tain honest men in offico and appoint ; only honest men to fill vacancies. Nobody can force him to make appointments or re movals for political reasons ; and it was in dispensable from the first thut he should I forego the making of such appointments in his own interest as a preliminary to refusing to make them in the interest of other poli ticians. His Southern policy is right, and the whole country will accept it. He has nothing to recant on that score and cannot be forced into a retreat. His position on the currency question is sound and udmirahle, and it is likely to call for an act of official courage. If he performs that act with decision, when the occasion arrives, he will make strong friends and fierce enemies ; hut the final verdict of his countrymen will be favorable. Wc hope ho will reorganize his Cnbinet; hut that is a question for him to decido. But in any event let him have nothing more to do with specious shams and try to administer the government in the true spirit of our institutions. It is still in his power to make a successful administra tion if he does not exchange one set of had advisers for another set of a different stripe but equally had. He must not surrender to the machine, but to common sense. Tl?e I'nater Monument. It is proper to call public attention once more to the project of erecting a monument to the dead hero, General Custer. There is now in the hands of the treasurer of the fund about six thousand dollars, and we aro informed that another thousand dollars is reaily to ho placed at the disposal of the committee. The aggregate sum would of itself serve to erect a very creditable statue, such as the Hkuald suggested should be placed at West Point. It is probable that three or four thousand dollars more may ho collected ; but the longer such an effort is delayed the more difficult it will be to carry out the patriotic design. At all events an artist should he secured without further delay and before the wane of pub lic interest in the enterprise. All experience in such matters shows that it is much easier to raise money on works in progress than on those which aro merely promised or projected. It is to be regretted that the venerable William Cullen Bryant, of the committee, has felt it neces sary to resign,- but in doing so he has sug gested the naiuo of a well known painter as a gentleman competent to serve *in Lis pluce. Mr. Bryant's judgment in thus se lecting an artist as a member of the com mittee is excellent, inasmuch as ho can be ot service to his associates in selecting from the various plans that may he offered. Now that sufficient iunds are on hand with ?which to begin the work it is to ho hoped that the committee wiH take action as soon as convenient. * Not Knougli tor the Money. Many New Yorkers who aro old enough to have been habitats of Burton's Theatre have a pleasant recollection of the roaring farces that used to be bo admirably acted at that house and that were certain to send home the audiences in excellent spirits, with their digestions improved by laughter and with a certainty of a good night's sleep before thorn. Younger citizens, who do not remember Burton's, and only know the memorable old building, whose every brick was consecrated to fun and jollity, as a dry, dusty, musty old nest of mysterious United States courts and marshals' offices, have yet seen these farces occasionally played, and sometimes well played, within the lust twenty years. At Wallack's, Niblo's, the Broadway and the Bowery, up to within the last ten yours, forces used occasionally to l>e played, and in some houses the evening's entertainment of our futhors?a drama, with a farce either to precede or lollow it, and sometimes a spectacle to close or a short ballet between the pieces?was long adhered to. But nil this seems to have gone out of fashion, and now a theatre-goer who pays a dollar and a hall for a seat is bound to be satisfied with a "comedy," as some pieces aro called, in defiance of the critical Boucicault, or a "so ciety play," or a French pioco of naughti ness, lull of divorcos, intrigues, flirtations and flummery all, like "liuked sweetness long drawn out," or, in other words, diluted and made wearisome in order to till tho necessary space of time supposed to bo proper for an evening's entertainment. The desiro of the managements nowadays ap pears to be to economize in their companies by giving only a single piece and allowing tho music to fill up tho necessary tiino by playing enough overtures and airs for an ordinary concert before and during the performance. Ihe music at tho New York theatres is cer tainly excellent, as a rule; but people who pay their money to see a dramatic perform ance do not care about being put ofl' with diluted dialogue and an extraordinary sup ply of fiddle scraping and horn blowing. The New York audiences of to-day do not got enough for their money. A single play in an evening may bo enough occasionally, when it is a thoroughly good one and is not dragged out and rendered tiresome for the j purposo of making it act the orthodox lenglli ( ot time. But three-fourths of the single | pieces could he cut down an hour, j at least, and vastly improved by the j curtailment. This would afford limo for , one ot the roaring, amusing farces with I which the stage libraries abound, give tho ! theatre-goers their money's worth, and send everybody home satisfied. It may be said that we have now no good furce actors, but this is an error. If the old farces were re stored to the Stage they would find plenty of excellent interpreters, and wo should not be long without our line of Burtons, Hollands, Placide* and Walcotts. If some of our managers would think more of tho people and less of the profits, and give us back the good old farces us an additional attraction to their present performances, there would be no more grumbling at tho prices of admission, which have thus fur succeeded in maintaining war rates I The tt*Bd?rU of Val??>Folly of the Silver FanatUi. A disgusted and satirical Athenian once stood up in the legislative assembly of that State and made a formal proposal that a law should be enacted declaring that asses are horses. The purticulur absurdity which he undertook to expose by that motion was not a whit more grotesque than the utteinpt now making in Congress to enact that ninety cents' worth of silver shall bo a dollar. Waiving the scientific objections to a double standard of value, it is obvious that the idea of two standards is preposterous unless, at the time they are established, they arc at par or very nearly at par " with euch other. If in a law fixing the standard of weights und measures it should be gravely enacted ordaining that seven pints and eight pints shall be equally a gallon, or that thirty inches und thirty-six inches shall be equally a yard, the lawmak ing power would be hooted for its confusing defiance of common sense. The standard coin of a country being tho measure of other values it ought to have all the steadi ness attainable. If gold is to be a standard and silver is also to be a standard the coin age in the two metals should be so adjusted that tho market value of tho metal in the one should bo equal to tho market value of the metal in the other at the time the coin age law is passed. Otherwise it is like a law dcclnring that assos aro horses. The pending Silver bill enacts that -412 1-2 grains of standard silver shall be u dollar, repeating tho provision of tho statute of 1837, which proscribed that amount of silver as tho equivalent of a gold dollar. That law was passed in January, 1837, when tho price of silver, as measured by gold, was GO 3-8 pence per ounce. The silver quotation cabled from London yester day showed that the present price of silver, as measured by gold, is 53 3-1 pence per ounce. The 112 1-2 grains of staudard silver Which Congress is asked to stamp as a dollar is to-day worth a shade le3s than ninety cents. It is simply ridiculous to propose that we shall have one dollar worth ninety cents and another dollar worth a hundred cents, and that they shall be equally a standard for meusnring all other values. It would bo more consistent to re duce the gold standard ten per cent. This, indeed, would bo equally dishonest toward the public creditors, but it would avoid the confusion nnd absurdity of two widely dif ferent standards. Is there anybody brazen enough to advocate a debasement of tho gold standard by coining eagles containing only nine dollars' worth of gold and making them a full tender for the dis charge of gold debts contracted under the present standard ? But there iB precisely the samo dishonesty, the same fraud, in au thorizing a gold debt of a thousand dollars to be discharged by a tender of nine hun dred dollars' worth of silver. Avitty Increase and Reorganization. There are considerations bearing directly on this measure that deserve serious atten tion before it can be recommended for adoption. 'Ihese are the question of addi tional expense iuvolvcd in an increase of tho regular army, the effect of such an in crease of our forces on the political rela tions of tho United Htates with neighbor ing Powers, the propriety of affording the general government an additional means of enforcing its authority on individual States beyond the limit prescribed by the consti tution, and the danger of creating in the Republic a military caste whose ideas may not always harmonize with the spirit of our institutions. A communica tion addressed to the Hsbald from "Army Officer," and published elsewhere to-day, enters very fully into many questions relat ing to the present wants of the army. The opinions expressed come from one who evi dently feels a just prido in his profession and a laudable desire to see the army of the United States rnised to the highest standard of strength and efficiency. While his esti mate of one thousand soldiers for every mill ion of inhabitants is a reasonable one it must not be forgotten that we possess a very efficient territorial army in our State mili tias, nnd one that is available for all pur poses of maintaining domestic tranquillity. We certainly need in the Western Territories and on our Southern frontier a strong mobile force for the suppression of Indian out breaks and tho prevention of Mexican raids. But we want no increase of the regular army in tho organized States, be cause our militia system guarantees order and United States forts and arsenals only require to be guarded by small forces for tho protection of government property. With five thousand troops on the Rio Grande, fifteen thousand distributed west of tho Missouri liiver, five thousand for guard duty in tho States nnd five thousand as a reserve, an army of thirty thousand men of all arpis would bo largo enough for all purposes of a pcaoo establishment. With a well-organized staff this force could form the nucleus of nn immense army should the nation ever need its services. Tho sugges tions of "Army Officer" regarding tho or ganization of tho staff are well deserving of tho attention of Congress. A Wonderful Conversion. The President of the Department of Health insists that tho aRlies und garbage can bo separated and kept so, and "the ordinances in relation to tho subject can bo carried out if tho Police Department will supply tho necessary carts." Professor Chandler further claims that one thousand able-bodied men could do all the street clcuning ; that fifty cafts would bo suffi cient ; that the city ought to be districted under competent foremen, and that the work could be done by any private citizen for one hundred thousand dollars per year less than the Police Department gets for not doing it at all. The sudden adoption by Professor Chandler of all tho views of tho Hruald in this matter of street cleaning is something remarkable. It is almost thrill ing, considering tho recently expressed opinions of tho learnod gentleman. What will the Police Board do now, when de serted by its ally, the Health Board? Professor ('handler practicully charges that even if all the work of street cleaning was done by the Polico Department an amount of one hundrod thousand dollars per annum has beau obtained from tho oity tmwry under false pretenoes. What may be said when it is considered that the work in question was not done at all ? What has been tho amount of the annual misappro priation ? Marshal MacMahon's Rnrraadar. The news from Paris is of the kind that people commonly regard as almost too good to be true. Peaceable and happy solution of tho differences between the majority and tha Executive seemed to have become as nearly as possible hopeless; rumors of pos sible violence were in the air; the gun shops were shut up; the troops were kept in barracks; the Bonapartists?birds of evil omen?were heard from, and every day was fruitful in dismal presage for the French Republic, when, suddenly, the whole scene is changed to bright and cheerful colors and changed as easily, it would seem, as one may turn a glove inside out in draw ing it from tho hand. It does not appear that any other man in France is different from what he was ex cept Marshal MacMahon, and he ap pears to be very different indeed. Bombastos Furioso, defying the world to re move his boots, but eventually deciding to make an exception in favor of any man whom tho boots will fit, would scarcoly ex hibit a moro remarkable change of tone than is found in the Marshal, who has de clared within tho course of the lust few months that he would do everything that he has failed to do, and that he would not in uny conceivable circumstance do the one thing he has at last done. But it should be remembered that this is not tho first time Marshal MacMahon has given M. Dufaure carte blanche to form a Ministry. On the former occasion his carte blanche had nevertheless a few lines written on it. It was not absolutely blanche, but was inscribed with a reservation of three important pluces. Has he made some reser vations on this occasion also, to be only heard of just as Dufaure has seoured the as sent of enough good men to constitute the administration? Vacillation is the quality which disputes with stubbornness the con trol of tho Marshal's mind ; so that there may be changes yet, but we trust the un pleasant experiences of the crisis have finally disciplined tho Marshal amply on this pojnt. From the notion that tho Right ?'authorized" tho Marshal to do what he deemed proper to end tho crisis it is made to appear that he watf professedly the agent of the combined elements of reaction in all that has taken place, which, we suspect, is a form given to the account of the event merely to coyer the Marshal's personal vanity.
