C. The foregoing bills and petitions were laid on the table to await the formation of the committees. A resolution, introduced by Mr. Plumb, calling , upon the Secretary of the Treasury for lnforma- ; tion concerning national bank examinations, with i special reference to banks that have recently Tailed (in -iudlng the German-American National Bank of this city), was agreed to. TI1E PRESIDENTIAL DISABILITy QCBSTIOX. Mr. Beck offered a resolution with a long preamble, reciting that to the end that all doubts or defects which may exist In our present laws on the subject of the succession to the Presidency in case of disability, &c., may be remedied and future controversy prevented, belt Resolved by trie Senate, That the committee on : the judiciary be instructed to examine into said provisions of the Constitution and into the laws passed by Congress to carry them into effect, and inquire whether the provisions of said laws are constitutional, proper and adequate in all respects to their purpose and end, or whether any further j legislation be uecess.iry or proper, and to report j thereon by bill or otherwise. At 1:05 p.m. the President's message was received , from the hands of Mr. Pruden, one of the President's private secretaries, and was read. Home of Representatives. In the House, to-day, Mr. Haskell again offered . his resolution continuing in force the rules of the i last House, and giving the committee on nil 's > leave to report any revisions or amendments at j any time and demanded the previous question. ! He, however, yielded to allow Mr. Morse, of i Massachusetts, ;ind Mr. Scales, of North Carolina, to qualify as members. Mr. Randall raised the point of order against j Mr. Haskell's resolution and demanded that the : territorial delegates t>e sworn In. i The speaker sustained the point of order and all the delegates, except the one from Utah, qualified, j tue delegate from utah. The Speaker then said: There is a controversy i on the matter or the delegate- rrom Utah. There j are several certificates (or at least two), held by j two different gentlemen, and it Is a matter, as the chair understands it, that cannot be determined in advance, either by the old clerk or the new clerk, and the chair does not understand that It hasanv power to determine which should go on the roll and be called for the purpose of being sworn in. Mr. Cox, (N. Y.)?I ask whether the name of a delegate from Utah is not on the roll? The spe iker.?The chair has already stated that, i as at present advised, and knows no law that authorizes any clerk to put a delegate on any roll. Mr. Randall.?'There Is a gentleman here churning to be a delegate, and this House must take cognizance of this Tact. It Is a question of the highest privilege, and must be now determined. The Speaker.?'The chair is of the same opinion. Mr. Cox.?Why did the chair ask the gentleman to step aside? * The Speaker.?His name has never been called. The inquiry Is of the House as to whether he shall be sworn in. The chair recognizes no roll as far its delegates are concerned. Mr. RandalL?Does the chair decide that It is not the right of a member to ask that the certificates should be read? The Speaker.?Yes; until the question Is properly before the House. The Speaker then recognized Mr. Haskell to offer a resolution. Mr. Cox.?By what right did the Speaker call the other names? Mr. HaskelL?He has not called any names. I am on the lioor by recognition of the Speaker. The Speaker.?The chair understands the law to be that the old clerk Is required to make up a roll of members and not of delegates. Mr. Randall.?Does the clialr decide that I, as a representative, h ive no right to call for the reading of those certificates? Why did you call the other delegates? The Speaker.?Because the chair thought that he had the right to call the n;unes of those delegat's, ascertaining that there was no challenge or controversey In those cases. Mr. Cox.?But the Speaker cannot make the roll; the clerk does that. Mr. Haskell, after a good deal of confusion and noise, managed to offer his resolution as follows: Resolved, th it Allan G. Campbell, delegate-elect from Utah Territo'y, is entitled to be sworn in as delegate to this House on a prima facie case. Mr. Cox raised a {joint of order against the resolution that Mr. Cannon's name was on the rolls, and that the chair was bound to recognize that fact. Mr. Haskell called for the reading of Mr. Campbell's certificate. Mr. Randall called for the reading of all the certificates, and the chair stated that they should be rei?d. Mr. Campbell's certificate was read. It Is signed by the governor of Utah, and is given to Mr. Campbell because "he was the person, being a citizen of the United States over 21 years, who had the greatest number of votes." Mr. Haskell claimed that this was the only certificate from Utah, and objected to the reading of any other paper. Mr. McLane contended that the chair having stated that iill the certificates were to be read, could not withdraw that ruling. Mr. Cox argued In support of his point of order, contending that under sections 31 and Revised Statutes, the clerk was required to prepare the list of delegates; and in this opinion he was sustained by Mr. Herbert, of Alabama. Messrs. Kobeson (N.J.) and Reed (Me.) took the opposite view, the latter quoting a decision by Sneaker Colfax, that the clerk could not put on the rolls the names of delegates. The Sneaker overruled the point of order. The whole matter was then postponed until tomorrow morning, and the members then proceeded to the drawing of seats. Mr. Page asked that Mr. Kelley be allowed to choose his seat in advance ; and Mr. Townshend (111.) the same privilege for Mr. Cox (N. Y.) Mr. Reed thought no preferred stock should be Issued; and objection was made to every such request, except in the cases of Mr. Stephens and Mr. Hawk. Capitol Notes.

Freeman was arrested, and, after a hearing t in the Police Court to-dajr, was committed la de- -J fault of $1,000 bonds. ; % Annual Kcyrt t the Secretary ?f the In the annnal report of the Secretary of the Treasury, submitted to Congrvas uvda> . attention Is caltad to the Impracticability of executing the law as it now stands requiring public disbursing officer* to draw for roads, placed to their credit, only in favor of the persons to whom payment is to oe made. A passage of a hill authorising the renewal of the charters of national banks upon the expiration of their corporate e\tstcn<e 1* recommended. Relative to tW reserve for the redemption of the United States notes the report says that It Is generally conceded that for aafe1>'inking, a reserve of 40 per cent to meet current obligations is necessary. It Is recommend**1 th;it the act requiring the Lssue of silver certificates be j repealed. The issue of cold certificates is consldI omi very objectionable. In view of any possible demand for the redemption In <*oJ? of legal-tender notes. It Is suggested that Congress caa prohibit n it'.onal banks from retiring their currency except upon a previous notice of a given length. The question ts raised whether the notes or the government cau and shall be luainialRcd as l?>galtender currency since the government resume J the payment or its debt in gold and silver coin. It Is suggested that a permanent appropriation be made ror the redemption of fractional paper currency outstanding, and for the liquid itlon or the i puhltc deht which matured before iSflrt, and r<I mains outstanding. Referring to the payment of l ulled states bonds In gold, the report says equity I If not strict construction of law requires that the i holders of such bonds should receive payment ther of In gold or Its equivalent, and tint ttv* government Is abundantly able to discharge its obligations lu money which Is everywhere accepted as a true standard of value. The report urges as the most potential mens i of bringing about any concert i* action, In regard | to a bl-met line standard among different nations, j that the I'nlted st ites suspend for the present the further coinage of silver dollars. The report calls | attention also to the necessity of revising the tariff to meet the condition of many branches of trade. Considerable space Is dev<it'ed to Hie discussion ot the subject of the reduction of taxation. The tax on deposits iu national banks and upon their capital. in the Judgment of the department, may, with propriety and 1 justice be lessened whenever it Is determined that the public revenue exceeds the public needs. There an* other minor sources of j Internal revenue that might l?e given up. The propriety of establishing a new tribunal for the trial of customs cases is suggested. After revh wlug the bond operations of the year, the report says, upon the authority of men eugaged In financial operations, that a u<?w loan of 3 per cent would be taken up. If It was by Its condition irredeemable save by a long term. It Is recommended in case of a new loan, that a long term of payment l?e given to the bonds. Among other tilings, the attention of Congress Is called to the ne<essiiy of more direct legislation respecting the quarantining of foreign cattle. The subject of pros**cutlng a search for the Arctic exploring vessel Jeannette, is also commended to the attention of Congress. 

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. Under the head of District of Columbia Secretary Folger says: The net expenditures on account ot the District of Columbia for the fiscal year 1HSI were $3,543,912.03.

D?,eember 6.?The Pott* financial article (1:40 p. in. edition) says: At the Stock Exchange the market for U.

The stock market during the first hour was weak with the exception ot Richmond and Danville and Reading. About 11 o'clock the decline was cheeked and there has since been a fractional improvement and a steadier and firmer tone. The net n-sult up to this hour of the fluctuations 1s a decline of J*al Y per cent. The loan market is stringent, and there are excellent reasons for believing that It Is artificially so. The ruling rate of bank and other inst itutions for call loans is 6 oer cent., but the stock brokers have - ready paid to-day additional commissions t \e-slxty-fourth to one-eighth of one per cent pt.

A Man Terriblv, Perhaps Fatallv, Beaten bv an Enhaobo Husband.?A very serious and perhaps fatal altercation took place In the northwestern section of the city at an early hour this morning, between two colored men named John Newman and Charles Brown, In which Brown wan terribly beaten. Policemen Young and Larrabee put Newman under arrest, He stated to the officers that he and wife live in the same house, (No. 5 Goat alley, between ath and 7th and L and M sts northwest.) with Charles Brown, and h1 (N*w man) works In the New York avenue UoidL On coming home about 2:30 o'clock this morning he found his wife's bed room door locked and immediately broke it open, and his wife and Brown started uo, shrieking. He then picked up a large pitcher and broke it over Brown's head and then kicked him. Brown then escaped from the house in his night clothes and was followed by Mrs. Newman in the same condition, and they took refuge with some neighbors. The officers found a bed in the room covered with blood and pieces of the pitcher. Dr. Charles King was summoned and rendered aid. He stated that the skull was fractured In three places, and be had to remove two pieces of the bone. In the Police Court this morning a certificate was received from the physicians stating that Brown's injuries were of such a serious character that he is not able to appear as a witness. Newman was committed without bonds on the < harge or ass ;u!t and battery with intent to kill. The impression Is that Brown cannot recover. Dktrcctiv* Incendiary Firb This Morning.?
