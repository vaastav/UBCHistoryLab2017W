I I FROM OUR TRAVELING CORRES PONDENT. -ntlerlcir Sanctum and Among Editors. DEAR Journal : Leaving the railroad depot in Marion, S. C, we walked up into "the village," and entered what in Mexico xrorM be called " the plaza," which id the adIV itl which the Court House stands, aud uroiu.d wli h the bvsdnesa part of the place L: uior.lr : AW ..ood on the cor- iierot' tli street thinking v.Loio we had bettor go,v hen cn a -J building quite across the square, we thought we saw a sign, Star Office, so we strclIM ovur, and finding the key ou the outside t the loci:, pushed and walked in. Beforu iu i e saw our old ac. ouaiutance, Major McKerrall, and we knew we were in an editorial " sanctonuu " or sanctum,' or if you prefer, " sanctum sanctorum." "Why our editors should call the place where everytxjdy feels at liberty to go, a sanctum, we could never learn. Perhaps our definition of the word is at fault. Behold us, then, actually in the pres ence of the senior, who presides over the destinies of the Marion Star. "We took a hasty glance at the room, gathering in our mind the contents almost as quickly as Hondon, the magician, used to make in ventories of rooms, or catalogues of libraries. It us sue if memory serves. One old rusty stove, no fire in it, two chairs, one box "set on end, serving the purpose of a chair, three sticks of wood, a pile of old ex changes, one window half paper panes, rest of glass, one shoe brush, evidently the property of the junior. One desk, at which in one of the chairs sat the senior. Suavity is a faint term for describing the pleasant ness of our reception. We sat and rolled our eyes over the labels of the pigeon holes of the desk, which told that the Major spent his hours of relaxation in the lighter and more pleasant pursuits appertaining to legal practice. There were labels of any quantity of hard named " writs " aud " sum monses," " bonds " and " notices," which would be tedious to name, though no doubt instructive to our readers, but we did not come to see them, but to interview the edi tors. The Major looks like a tolerably well preserved man of thirty-three years old. The cut of his countenance is almost Gre cian in prolile, but in front nearly wide enough to be Dutch, and but for his old Scotch name we might have judged from his evident tendency to embonpoint him square shoulders, and erect form that he was of teutonic origin. His face and form are those of a man who could endure a con siderable amount of labor without nagging, aud he has a dreamy kind of way of shut ting his eyes as if he was looking at some thing not visible to a bystander. Was it that power of introspection which enables men sometimes to think of one thing whilst talking of another. The Major is the heavj artillery of the .star, from his pen come the leading political articles of a paper which exercises no small influence in the sec-tioi. in which it is published, and what it fails to say in print the Major is presumed to be able to 3ay on the stump, to which, we are advised, he occasionally resorts when his columns will not hold the matter. We had just entered into conversation when the door tlew open, and, with almost a bound, a young gentleman entered the sanctum, talking over his shoulder to some one behind him as he came, and we bait the pleasure of meeting Mr. Steadmau, the Junior. Here is a man for the out-dooi work on a paper. He sat down on the box for five seconds, lie got up and turned rounu five seconds more, he walked three steps to wards the door and throe steps back ten seconds more, he caught up a paper aiu. put it on the desk, five seconds more; he kicked the cold stove and stirred up the three sticks of wood, he looked out the window through all the glass panes a few seconds, and all the time he was telling us how glad he was to see us and inquiring about absent friends. We replied, as rai idly as possible, for we saw he was in a great hurry, and, after a few minutes conversa tion, he made a few rapid remarks to the Major, excused himself to us and hastily left.. We had an idea at that moment that some momentous events were transpiring in the village, which required him in his reportorial capacity to be present. Well, now I know ail our young lady readers would like to know how the Junior looks. He is hard to describe. He has so much animal and mental vitality in him that no photographer has ever been aide to take his picture to his satisfaction. This much wq can venture, ladies, he is fine looking and unmarried. We think the Star has been materially improved since he came to it. The zest, the life, the fun of the paper, are all of his getting up. The local items are faithful pictures of what he sees and hears, written with a pen which yields word for thought with amazing facility. We brought our pleasant interview to a close, and w ent to see the Crescent. The editor was out, but on Sunday we visited the Sunday School, and found him standing in front of about an hundred children, beating time in the air with his hand and leading the singing. He is a tall, sedate looking man, with large whiskers, which are care fully combed" downward to protect his throat and preserve his singing powers, no doubt with a deep set eye, which changes in conversation, flashing from light blue al most up to purple; and, while singing, his manner is animated as if he felt t he thrill of even' chord oh every nerve of his body. When he closed the exercises and moveu out of the church you would never have thought that a "concord of sweet sounds'" could make such a difference in the man, Ue had subsided in a grave, rather stern looking representative of an elder in the church. The Crescent is ably edited. It strikes the vices of the rulers of South Carolina with heavy blows. There is no uucertain sound. Positions are well taken and well discussed, and all feel sure the editor means just what his editorials say, and that he fully believes them all. Our visit to the Marion press was pleasant ana agreeable to us, and we left wishing them heartily all imaginable success, as we went m search of oier sanctums, being as ever "In Transit." Some one asked Mrs. Cady Stanton if she thought that girls possessed the physique ne Msary for the wear and tear of a college course of study. Her reply is both sensible tmd sarcastic. "1 -would like to see you," said Mrs. Stanton, "take thirteen hundred young men aud lace them up, and hang Uu to twenty pounds' weight of clothes to thi'ir waists, perch them "upon, tliree inch heels, cover their heads' with tipples, chig oii4, rats and mice, and stick ten thousand jiairpiua into thtir iealps; if they can Stand all this, they can stand a little Latin aud Greek," Some Yankee painters were employed in a frontier Canadian town to decorate the walls of a ball-room in a tavern. As no designs w ere given them, they followed -heir osrvi patriot ic instincts and" style, anu tainted in a-sort of rough fresco the Amer ican shield, with eagle, arrows and all, ana fiie motto, 'E I'lurious Unum."

Persons who set around the fire and lounge on the sofa, or read or sew a great part of the day, need not expect sound sleep; only the laboring man can taste it in its sweet ness. Many fail to slevp at night b cause they will persist in sleeping in the day time. It is just as impossible to healthfully force more sleep on the system than the propor tion of exercise requires, as to force the stomach to digest more fxd than the body requires. Rather than court bleep by in dustrious activities, many persons resort to medicine, and every new drug which is her alded As a promoter cf sleep becomes at once immensely popular, even though it is known to jossess dangerous qualities.

Lafayette E. Fish cornmitted suicide in his house, at Hicks and Fulton streets, Brooklyn, Wednesday morning. Mr. Fish was forty-even years of age, temperate and industrious, but of weak mind. Five years ago he was a prosperous wholesale grocer in this city, but so prodigal that ruin overtook him. He removed to Brooklyn, and for nearly three years was a conductor on a railroad. The loss of his property preyed upon his mind, and the apparent slights which he sometimes received from his old associates stung him deeply. He frequent ly complained to his wife that his brain was burning that his hair felt like threads of molten lead. He made three several at tempts to take his life, but was always frustrated by his wife's sleepless vigilance. His morbid fancies assumed a form so alarming that his wife feared to share his room, and slept on a lounge near the door, her ears ever on the alert for his slightest movement, and her eyes watchful of all his actions. Last Thursday Mr. Fish com plained of feeling unusually ill, and from that time up to the morning of his death he rapidly grew worse. Yesterday his wife 'eft hhn for a few moments, not without misgivings, to procure medical assistance. When she returned a great crowd was col lected about her house, which fell back at her approach, and disclosed to her gaze tlie mangled corpse of her husband. It ap pears that Fish had availed himself of her absence to carry out his cherished plan,and, climbing to the roof of the house, which is four stories high, took the fatal leap, dash ing out his brains upon the sidewalk. X. Y. Sun. I Acknowledge the Co ra." In his new book on ' Americanisms,' Professor Scheie de Vere. of Virginia, dis courses on the origin of this phrase among others. He says : The Hon. Andrew Stewart, member of Congress from Pennsylvania, claimed in a recent speech to have caused its first appear ance in public. In 18rJ2 he was in Congress discussing the principle of protection," and said in the course of his remarks, that Ohio, Indiana and Kentueky sent their hay stacks, corn lU4d and fodder to New York and Philadelphia for sale. The Hon. Charles A. Wicklilie, from Kentucky, jumped up and said : " Why, that is absurd. Mr. Speaker, I call the gentleman to order. He is stating an absurdity. We never sent hay stacks or corn fields to New Yoik or Philadelphia." " Well," said I "what do you send?" "Why, horses,mules, cattle, hogs." "Well, what makes your horses, mules, cattle, hogs ? You feed a hundred dollars woith of hay to a horse you just animate and get upon the top of your haystack and ride off to market. How is it with your cattle? You mttke one o them cany iifty dollars worth of hay and grass- to the eastern market ; how much corn does it take at thirty-three cents a bushel to fatten it ?" "Why, thirty bush els." "Then you put that thirty bushels of corn into the shape of a hog, and make it walk off to an easteru market." Mr. Wickr lirle jumped up and said : "Mr. Speaker, 1 acknowledge the corn." " The other popidar account of the phrase ascribes it to the misfortune of a flatboatman who had come down to New Orleans with two fiatloats, laden, the one with corn, the other with potatoes. He was tempted to enter a gambling establish ment, and lost his money aud his produce, On returning at night tothe wharf, he found his boat with corn had sunk in the river, and when the winner came next morning to demand the stake, he received the an swer, 'Stranger, 1 acknowledge the corn, take 'em; but the potatoes you can't have, by thuauer.
