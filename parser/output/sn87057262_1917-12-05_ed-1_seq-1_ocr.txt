The matter presumably was taken up in the Paris inter-allled councils, but was temporarily put aside for more physical war measures. Judging from the reception of President Wilson's address today, the plan will be brought to the fore today. The Dally News comment today was practically an endorsement of the American re-pledglng plan. "If the president could have said earlier what he said today," the edi torial declared, "and if in Britain and France and Italy the responsible leaders of these nations had made his language their own, Russia might today be driving the German armies from her borders.
