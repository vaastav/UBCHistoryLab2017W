THE CHRONICLE. W. P. TITUS, Proprietor. $2.O0 I'EK ANNUM IX ADVANCE Saturday, December 8, 1888. THE OLD EEBEL TELL. A singular dramatic incident oc curred in the Superior Court room at Waynesboro during the trial of the Rogers brothers for the killing of the Kymses, father and son. The killing occurred at McUean's Station in Oc tober last. Eminent counsel had been eifgaged by the prosecution and de . fense, for both parties are prominent and wealthy. The evidence closed and the speaking began Friday morn ing, continuing all through the day. When the court assembled after tea, the seats and the aisles within the bar were crowded with ladies, while without a dense throng of men filled up the auditorium. It was before this assembly that Mr. Twiggs began his argument. Twiggs is an elo quent 'speaker, practiced in and noted for his oratorical graces. In the course of his three hours' ad dress he at one time referred in the -most feeling manner to the courage .and devotion of woman. The hour, the occasion, the audience and the dim light from which the rapt faces were bent upon him, all combined to form a surrounding well calculated to inspire the orator to his greatest effort. He closed his address upon .the women as follows : "At the bat tle of Gettysburg Gen. Pickett was ordered to begin the charge which was to make him famous. As he went into the terrible battle his young bride on horseback followed him. When the hail of death was beating down men on all sides, and the plungingshot and shell mingle! their fierce screams with the moans and cries of the mangled, Pickett sudden ly found himself in the presence of his wife. In an agony of fear for her safety he cried out to her, as she sat cool and collected as a veteran : "Go back ? Go back I For God's sake go back to the rear !' 'No,' replied the devoted woman, 'in the hour of dan ger a wife's place is by her husband's side." At this moment through the court room there rang out one wild, thrilling cry, which nearly lifted the excited throng to their feet. It was tnCoiu jeii, i.tuiu upon a hundred battlefields and never to be forgotten. A deep silence followed All eyes were turned toward the outer ziirolrt ThiMi .Tilflcro llnvilfVS Pnlfl voice was heard bidding: the sheriff arrest the offender. A man was seen dodging ihrougii the crowd, and the judge continued : "The man who is leaving is probably the one wanted." "No, judge," exclaimed a voice, slow ly; "I am the man." The speaker stood in the aisle with folded arms, quietly contemplating the bench. "I shall have to fine you $10, then, for disturbing the court." "Very well, your honor, I shall pay the money," said the man ; "but I meant no dis respect. I was a Confederate soldier at Gettysburg, and just could not help hollering." The ladies present snransr to their feet, and in an instant the monev was made up and paid to the clerk. The involuntary yell of the old soldier was an irresistable tribute to womanhood. Houston Post. Thk World's editorial on the president's message says : President Cleveland's last message is a digni fled, compact, clear and forcible pa per. As was to have been expected of a man who holds tenaciously to his opinions, the president reaffirms his position upon the tanfi question Like Gov. Hill he nails the tariff- reform flag to the Democratic mast head. "It is the people's cause." he declares, and should never be com promised." The President's argu ment upon this question is clear and stromr. If he hud sent this message to congress three years ago, and fol lowed it in lStf( with the issue-forc iii'' messace of last year, not even the power of money nor the persona disaffection in the party who elected Cleveland could have prevented Democratic success. Hut though the right thing was done at the wrong time, the Issue remains. The condition confronts us. The sur t.liw last year was $1 

UUKM.OOO. The purplus'for the current year is esti- J1U iui mi- mm -in in 1-.-U17 till at $101,000,001). The invest i of life are still enhanced in prii mat ries to the people, and the essentials f manufacturers are increased in cist by a prolonged war tariff; and Presi dent Cleveland has done well in again plainly defining and stoutly defending the lK-mocratic principle ou the orrty qutvtiwii of vital impor tance upon which the two parties art1 dearly divided. On the other gener al topics treated by him there is nothing said that is especially new or rtriking, though much of it is timely anil sensible. More noticeabh' than anything that is said Is the o'!iis.-io!i of all reference to civil service reform. Considering that Mr. Cleveland M'au elected largely upon this issue, and that he made it the one conspicuous feature of the first half of his adminis tration, the silence is significant. And yet the Mugwumpsstill continue for three months more to burn in cense before their idol. TnE Akron (O) Telegram says: 'The workings of the Yates prison bill in New York which was passed owing to the pressure brought upon the New York Legislature by those tradesmen whose products are brought nto competition with prison man ufacture Is proving little short of a curse to the State. The law throws a large proportion of the convicts in to idleness. They are now locked in their cells with nothing to do but to think of their past crimes or to hatch schemes to perpetuate others in the future. Prison labor in New York now cut down so that no more goods are manufactured than enough to supply the prison. The hat and brush manufacturers of New York should be sharp enough to see that where before the convicts were self- upported they are now living upon the earnings of honest men outside the Jail. The people pay for the idle ness of the convicts and the convicts have no chance to learn to be good citizens while they are in jail. The vw is a bad thing altogether and Ohio and other States which have been consideringjsome means to pre vent undue competition of convict abor with trades outside can profit by New York's failure to solve the problem at least to the extent of steering clear of the New York plan." Me. Thomas W. Yates, of Bart- ett, a teacher of nearly twenty years' experience, a gentleman of good natural abilities and popular with all who know him, is spoken of in con nection with the office of County Su perintendent of Public Instruction. The election comes off before the County Court in January. In the course of his career as an educator he has beon a close student and kept fully up with the text-books and the best methods and ideas of the times Mr. Yates has done his duty faith fully in all the relations of life. He entered the Confederate army when a mere youth and carried a gun as gallantly as any in the service until near the end of the war, when he lost an arm in battle. Thp other arm, as well as his brain, has since been well engaged in the peaceful pursuits of life. The office could be filled by no worthier man. Col. A. S. Colvae, who has writ ten about almost everything, has now tackled the race question, and in a long letter to the Commercial Gazette endeavors to find out how to reconcile fair elections and white supremacy. The problem is a nam one to solve, but Col. Colyar treats it in a masterly way. In one place he says : "in many parrs 01 me oouin, , , 1 n ii . rt .11. as in Tennessee, there are many elevated men among the negroes and they are as ready as the white men is to admit that in the extreme South, where lanre communities of the race are practically without ed ucation and without mental training, negro domination would bo a curse to both races. A policy which must, in the estimation of the Southern people, lead to the supremacy of the colored race and its domination, will unavoidably lead to social disorders, culminating in a struggle between the races for existence." When marriage occurs in the mer chant's family, he likes to see a nice article in the home paper about the event. When a visitor is entertained at his house he wants the paper to mention it. And when he starts on foot a movement for the public good, he wants the paper to stand on its hind legs and howl like a brindle dog on a moonlight night. But very often when he wants a little job of work dane he forgets all about the paper and sends off to the city be cause he can save a few cents and very often express charges runs the bill to more than the home printer wmld charge. He don't seem to see tie advantage of patronizing his 11 L!ome paper. He forgets that the home irinter would spend his money at 'home. Patronize your home printer. The Courier-Journal says: The price readjustments of the month just closed are phenomenal. There is a decline of S cents in corn ; 12 cents In wheat; $2 to S3 ahead in hogs, and of 1") percent, in hog products; J cent 1 in cotton, etc. Accompanying this decline 111 nelu produce, which in corn alone is due to excessive yield, is the very marvelous feature of a fall of more that 5 per cent, in the gen eral pitch of New York Stock Ex change values. This decline in secu-riti- s means a shrinkage, of course, in the ca-.li availability of the whole list t '." .-.'Vi'..l hundred h.i!';;!i tkllar, while exporting gold freely on the sales of European capital. Many of the papers and statesmen have been explaining the Democratic defeat. They are exercising 1 their hindsight with great ability. It is at tributed to Cleveland's tariff reform message, to the Mills bill, to Henry Watterson's Star-eyed Goddess, to sectional prejudice, to the free use of money and to hard lying. All these things may have had something to do with it, but the fact is, we were badly and unexpectedly beaten, and there la no use in whimpering over the lacteal fluid after it has once been drunk up by the thirsty earth. In addition to their White Cap ma rauders, the people of Ohio are hav ing trouble with their mixed schools, which are authorized by law, but to which the white people will not sub- rait. The colored children have been forcibly ejected from many schools, and the homes of their parents stoned night after night, their windows and doors being broken down. The col ored children who are guarded to and from the schools are the only ones who are safe from bodily harm. What is Gov. Fireworks Foraker go ing to do about it. The discovery that the convict lease system has not proved a source of profit, as had been commonly sup posed, will put a new phase on that question, and render more probable the adoption ot some other plan. About the only defense of the lease system has been that it yielded the State a revenue while all other plans had proved expensi ve. The following, from the twenty- seventh verse of the forty-ninth chap ter of Genesis, Is creating consterna tion iu the departments at Washing ton: "Benjamin shall devour his prey, and at night he shall divide the spoils." The Democratic clerks read and believe as some of them have probably never done before. Representative Stone, of Ken tucky introduced a joint resolution in the House yesterday proposing an amendment to the Constitution pro viding that the President and Vice- President shall be elected every four years by: the direct vote of the peq- ple. ' - , Death Of Gilbert T. Abernathy. -- 1 , Our citizens generally will be ?ad ened to hear of the death of Col. Gil bert T. Abernathy, which occurred at his residence in the lGth District, on Tuesday December 4th, at 1:30 oclock, of typhoid fever, aged sixty-eight years and seven months. In view of the factthat the de ceased was one of the most prominent citizens of our county, we feel that it is due to him, that a short obituary notice should be published giving the principle events of his life Deceased was a native of Tennessee, and was born May 2, 1820, and on the 8th of January 1839 was married to Miss Ann S. Baxter, to whom was born two children. On the 15th of December .853, he was married the second time to Emily B. Talley, the fruits of this union being eleven children. At the early age of sixteen years Mr. Abernathy volunteered as a soldier and went to fight the Creek Indians, in Florida, being absent seven months. For a while he was employed as book-keeper of the Ten nesse Iron Works, and in 1840 be came part owner, he continued suc cessfully in, the business until the war, and the firm was known as the largest iron mongers in the . State ; however in common with men of his class, his property was swept away by the vicissitudes of war. Having a large family on his hands, he. at once set about providing for theiri, and opened a school In Antioch, and soon established himself as one of the best educators in the country. The farm on which he resided at the time of his death, was the por tion received by Mrs. Abernathy from her fathers estate. Gilbert T, Abernathy was a brave and honest man. One who had bus iness transactions with him for almost twenty-five years, says he was a most acurate and competent accountant, and as honest as he was competent. He says he never knew him to make an error in his figures and his ledgers showed no ensures, and was without a blur in his elegant penmanship. He met adversity an honest, brave man, these were the salient trates in his character. In 1S82. at the urirent reiruost of his friends, he became a candidate for! nepnentativo as a State Credit Democrat, ami inaue a very creuua- blerace.

Another Old Land Mark Gone. Yesterday evening between 2 and 3 o'clock Henry Lyle, Sr., died very suddenly at his residence on the Southside of the river. He walked out to a little orchard near the house, and his wife noticed that hestumbled and fell over a log. She hurried out to look after him, and when she reached the spot found that he was dead. lie had been suffering for many years with vertigo and often reeled about ao a drunken man. and it is supposed that he died of ap oplexy of the brain. He was born in this county near where he died, and would have been seventy-five years old next Wednes day, December 12. He married Miss Jane McCorkle and to them were born thirteen children, most of whom are living. In 1818 he was ejected tax collector for the County and filled that office for thirteen years, under the old system of col lecting taxes. In 1872 ho moved to the farm where he died, formerly the J. P. Daly farm. In many respects he was a remark able man. Ills memory was extra ordinary in past events; he could give you dates and incidents accur ately and he was very fond of repeat ing past incidents to the youth of the present day. He belonged to McCul loch Lodge of Masons at Palmyra, and was a member of the Methodist church. 'His funeral was preached at the residence this evening at 4 o'clock, by his pastor Ilev. J. G. Rice, and the interment took place at the old family burying ground, where his father and inotherand many relatives have slept for many long years. The Chronicle extends its sympathy to the bereaved family and friends.
