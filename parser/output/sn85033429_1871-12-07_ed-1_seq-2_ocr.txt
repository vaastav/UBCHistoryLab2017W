The coming year will witness another j. v. m ... , fmport&nt ora in the history of tha Amcr . ican people. No less important duty de volves on the people of tho United States i .than that of selecting a Chief Magistrate . for this country. The doings of the 'pres. ' ant administration must, within the next twelve months be passed upon by the peo ple and their verdict at the ballot .. box ... most settle the future policy of the gov- ernment for the next four years as to "'' many questions of national importance. '" The reoent elections have settled one ques lion even in the minda- of the Democracy. J The next President will be a Republican ; .' and the only issue in the coming cara- eign will be whether a Republican of the " Grant School will be chosen or one of that milder type known as Conservative or ' moderate. The Democracy arc loud in their com plain tJ of what they term the de-potism ' -exercised by the present administration toward tho people of the South, and yet, nntil within a few months, there has been ; but very little interference n tht part of the General Government in the affairs of the South. As a general thing they hare been allowed to manage their domestic .- affairs after their own fashion, and not un til their State Governments had proved a failure and a farce did the Federal Au thorities ioterfero. Any Government is a failure tbat does , Bet prevido ample protection to its hum blest citiien in the exercise of the rights guaranteed him by the Constitution. This is what the the Southern - State .Govern ment have failed to do. WLere the United States authorities have found suffi eient cause to warrant the arrest of hun dreds of confessed malefactor?, and even to suspend the writ of hateat con-vs the States themselves have never deemed it . necessary to interfere in any way or to v autse the arrest of a single individual. ' These faots are well known to the great '. mass of the people and their response in . she Lite elections may safely be taken as a - signal of approval of the course adopted ' by the administration. The South has done itself great injury u by permitting these acts of . lawlessness which .have at last forcod the-. General Gevernmewt into adopting strong tncas- mres to suppress them?' and it has not only ' impared its own interests pecuniary as . well as every other, but it has ruined the Democratic party, and blasted its last i hep of obtaining control of tho coun- i try, ; . " We can see nothing now to prevent the election of a Republican for the next President, and there is small room for doubt that Grant will be the roan. gantio rebellion and ' the K despotism to which it gave birth, and the brilliant suc cesses of hia policy in restoring power and permanence to a victorious government, can never be forgotten.' whilst their hearts are stirred with chagrin of defeat. There fore, they now propose a capitulation with the disaffected - Republicans who oppose the President because they can not turn him to their own account. This must provo another defeat in their fast filling chapter of failures. These sore headed Republicans are too wise to venture upon a plan that will prove their own political death-warrant, and too honest and sincere in their party devotion to enter into a co alition, having for its object the reascen dency of the Democratic party. ' As we have , frequently stated before, they are committed by' many pledges, to the sup port of the nominee of the National Re publican Convention. Ichabod is written in flaming characters upoa the Democratic castle. Its runious career is closed.. Wrong, corruption, tyrranny and treason have sealed its doom. "The Government pf the people, by " the people and for the people." must stand invulnerable to its plot tings. - THE 

LAST RESORT. ' ' Since the fall of that Colossus of pri vate corruption, and political dishonesty .,ia Nevr York, .the infamous Ring of Tarn- j'mnny, tho ' Democracy 1 of the entire na tion has been at tea. The foul conspiracy ' held all sections in thrall, in the inanago .iaeat and control of national elections. Its j. behests were to imperative and absolute, 'I basked by millions of stolen money, that DO democrat could command a successful influence .against it. " A remorseless rigor aef punishment and persecution effectually oppressed all refractions and party trca eoBd. ; - So long had these oppressions and "dictations been carried on that they. bad f become a vast regular system, supporting and. vitalizing the Democratic party." As . a consequence, when Tammany was hurled 'te ruin for its unparalleled iniquities and villainies, its established plans were com pletely disconcerted, and. the Democratic .ranks were precipitated into cdnfusion and demoralization. ' The leaders them selves were panic-stricken, and were un able to gather together the scattered frag ments of the universal wreck. The Val--landigbam movement proved a miserable and' fatal failure. Other expedients were suggested to meet the dark ordeals that "liad so I suddenly and unexpectedly befallen them, and shared the same fatality. - The dethronement of Tammany darkened eve ry hope and placed a tignet of despair'and defeat upon every effort. All. idea of running a democratic candidate for ' the JVesidency, has been abandoned by even Ihe most sanguine and ambitious leaders.

' " Terrible Affair at Spring Hill.' - A special dispatch to tho Nashville Banner says : . . Spring Hill, December 1, 1871 . A most lamentable occurence took place here yesterday, which came near terminat ing in a terrible tragedy and which has occasioned no little excitement in Spring Hill and viciuity. J. L. McKissack. a member of one of the oldest and most respeac table. families of Maury County, during a temporary fit of insanity yesterday, attempted to take the life of his mother, his two sisters and a young child. , ' It appears that some time ago he had, in self-defense killed a negro, and since that time his friends declare he has been laboring under great mental distress, from having heard a preacher recently say, taking his text from Judges, " no man who shed another's blood, whatever the circumstances of the act, could possibly hope for salvation." This sermon and these particular words seemed to have gravely impressed him at the moment, and it was poon thereafter observed that his mind was affected. .Yet while he was known to be insane, he was believed to be harmlss, and no effort was made to restrain his movements. Yesterday morning ns his sister, Mis T. O. McKissack, was going down stairs with his own child in her arms, he crept steal thily "upon her from behind and struck her a fearful blow on the head with a hatchet, felling her to the floor. . Passing over her prostrate form, as it lay in a pool of blood. ho weut into his mother's room, finding her there sprang upon her with the fury of a madman, and cut her with the hatchet, inflicting three different wounds, one wound in the head, leaving a dangerous rupture. Rut for the almost superhuman efforts of Mrs. Robert J. Moore, (another sister of McKissacks), who happened to be iu the room at the time, and who, with marvellous prnce of mind, realized the situation of affairs and came to the rescue, there is no doubt but that Mrs. McKissack would hae been killed. Mrs. Moore engaged in a desperate struggle with him, during which he gashed ner wun lue naccnet under tue lett ear, but she finally wrested, it from him by main force. Ho then drew a razor from his pocket and cut himself badly in the left side, though looking at himself in a mirror while doing so, after which he rush ed out into the street, made a deep cut in the other side, though by this juncture bw father and brother cmc up and rescued him from himself. He cried out wildly that he had killed them all at home, but could . not explain the frantic impulse which had induced him to do the deed He now l'es in a critical condition.' Dr White, the attending physician, thinks Irs. KcMiseack, his mother, and Miss T, O. McKissack, his sister, may possibly re cover.'
