HITCHCOCK FOE Nebraska x Nebraska From a Staff Correspondent.) WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. (Special Telegram . ) President Wilson's message will not solidify the demo crats of the nation, as It undoubt edly was Intended to do, but will rather, tend to divide the democracy Into two hostile camps. This, in a nutshell, is the situation in Washing ton, according to one of the keenest and most farseelng democrats, as he expressed himself in good round English at the capitol today. Representative Solan, vvho Is a pretljr keen observer and quite alive to the value of Impressions, mid tiiat all of President Wilson's messages have been rhetorically valuable, but th:it In his Judgment the. message "of today fell far below any for mer effort, both In Its delivery and lt reception by conaress. o Baals for Increase. "Tho full basis for the sudden and Im mediate demand." said Mr. Sloan, "for such a large Increase In the army and navy was disappointingly not revealed. "Tho piopcsltlon to pay as we no ap peals to me, although the method of paytnrnt I cannot endorse. The proposi tion to tax smaller Incomes, gasoline, automobiles, bank checks, to pay for preparedness, while leaving the products of the northwest on the fre lift, thereby losing many millions of revenue and fos tering the competition of water rates of our competitors, with our higher railroad rates, paid by farmers, should not appeal to our section of the country. "Reasonable duties collected on farm products or the lat two years and dur ing the next five would mbet a reason able increase of cost for reasonable pre paredness." Hitchcock Complimentary. In strong contrast with these views of Bpresentaflve Sloan, Senator Hitchcock was generally most complimentary of the tone of the message, believing It took high ground and was worthy of being followed. The senator, however, is un compromising in his belief that the gov ernment should make its own munttlona of war, rather than let private corpor ations do the manufacturing. Upon the proposition of "paying as we go," Senator Hitchcock heartily endorsed the president's position and came out strongly for his scheme of raising revenues by a sur-tax. He thought the country generally would endorse the president's attitude upon all the big ques tions now before It. ."The president's message Is most ad mirable," said Representative Stephens, "but I am opposed to the feature of a continental army. I believe in aiding the State militia. As to the navy Increases suggested by the president I have serious doubts if I can go with him the whole length of the proposed program. I am in favor of a reasonable increase in tho Davy with special reference to submarines and aeroplanes. I am especially in favor of the president's message with reference to the merchant marine as a part of the liavy" establishment:" --'---- r ..
