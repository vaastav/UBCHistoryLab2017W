10 4 THE SUN, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1918. BUDS AND BRIDES RULE IN WASHINGTON BROOKLYN ADVEItTISKMKNTS. Failure of Cabinet WomentoResume Their 4 'Before the War" Days Activi ty Gives Younger Folk a Chance Washington-, December 7. SEVERAL thousand anthuslastlc Washington citizen and cmo dlgnined gray pussy cat crowdod the Union Station Tuesday night to ay ,"Good-by" to the President, and Incidentally to a few others who were about to entrain on the flrststage of their Journey to Paris. No, Cicely, I wtu not tho gray pussy cat, though I flld wear that gray bollvla coat and niy gray furs. There was another. It had slipped through tho guards at tho entrance to the President's prlvato waiting room, and waited Just lnsldo the door "all same like me!" But I Jiad borrowed a poltco badgo for tho occasion and pussy hadn't. It was sheer luck my being there. I had thought of going but had not Wanted to wait around Indefinitely the Tvholo evening. And It tiever Is an nounced Just when a Presidential party will set forth. It simplifies the work of the secret service not to do eoj Calling up Mrs. Lansing to wish Jisr "bon voyage," I caught her Just waiting for their motor to take them to the station. She confirmed casually my own suspicion that tho party was going to New York on tho President's train andwero to rendezvous at tho station any time after 10. Incidentally the assured me she would read theso tatters every week while sho was away tofln5 out what was really going on In Washington. 1 Troops Form a Human Lftne I hastened to the- station, slipped through and lined myself up alongside of. Major Pullman, our Chief of Police. Who Is an old friend, Just before they all arrived. Details of soldiers and allors wero on duty and as the party' passed through the doors several hun dred stalwart figures In khaki and In blue formed a human lano through Which tho Chief Executive, tho First Lady and her secretary, Miss Edith Benham, whose .father was a Rear Admiral, passed. Those were tho only three who set forth actually from the lVlilto House on this momentous Jour ney. Mrs. Wilson was wearing a coat suit ft dark blue, which she has often worn around tho Washington, streets, a Eeml-ftttlng coat with deep cuffs and wldo rolling collar of sealskin, and a well cut skirt, not too short, with seal skin bands edging tho side panels. Bho woro with this a small 'black hat with little pointed wings of the aero plane variety, sticking out at one side und toward the back. She also was wearing a lovely slnglo orchid and a wide smile." Miss Benham was so completely done up In a caracul coat that it was liard to seo what she had on under neath, and Mrs. Lansing? who was pacing tho platform for ten or fifteen minutes while the others wero en training, was swathed In sealskin. Diplomats In Other Cars. Thetje were other cars reserved for tho President's guests from thp diplo matic circle, the French and Italian Ambassadors and their families, with presumably such olds and secretaries us they deemed necessary, and yet others for tho American members of .he party the Secretary of State nnd Mrs, Lansing, the Ambassador to St. James's and Mrs. Davis, Secretary Baker, Mr. Tumulty tho two latter went to New York with the President, though they did not sail with him and Henry White, former Ambassador and now peace delegate. Washington, at least the part of the population of the national capital that counts, or thinks It does, turned out o hear tho President's message lc ore tho two houses of Congress last yMonday. Mrs. Wilson, with a large party of Boilings, was In the front reats of the Executive gallery. Mrs. McAdoo came down and joined them, fitting next to her stepmother. She was most attractive In a tailored suit of golden brown, with golden brown furs that might havo been mink, and & little fur toque. Nearly tlm entire group of "Cablnet eers" wero in that little gallery Mrs. Marshall, Mrs. Lansing and her most intimate friend, Mrs. John W. Davis; Mrs. Daniels, Mrs. Lane, Mrs. Iled fleld, Mrs. Houston, Miss Agnes Hart Wilson, whose mother has been too much of an Invalid to go anywhere, and Jano Oregory, and Sydney Burle eon, who camo In together, apparently representing their mothers. In the opposite gallery across the length of the chamber Is tho Speakers family "pew." but Mrs. Clark had so many gueqts that sho herself was crowded out. She wan looking, par ticularly weH and had on a most be coming hat, a small round toque with a black satin crown nnd dahlias In dark red and purplish tones laid flat around it, and sho was woarlng a graceful loose wrap of black watln with a slight conventional embroidery design. To return to Mrs. Clark she is re suming her "before the war" Wednes days. Sho was at home Informally last Wednesday and Is tho first of the official women to get back onto hci "before tho war" social basis. "Cubl net" days, suspended during the war seem doomed. It was a nice friendl' democratic sort of an Institution. Bu I haven't found any ono of them read to commit herself as to taking up the burdon again, und It certainly was i, burden. Most of tho official wotner would not havo had tlmo for It dven If they had had tho inclination. Tho re still knee deep In war work, for tho aftermath requires scarcely Wh a effort than did octlvo wnrfare, nnd I Is much harder to keep the forces to gether. You know this business of muster ing people out of service and of hang ing around to ree what's going to hap pen Is very trying. All my best frlenili are moro or less doing it. and one won ders who is Kl)ing to may and who t going tu ! permitted to go home, .lusi the other iH ti1R Archibald Hurkllcn Sn'f Uy '.ow,y "Wment here at Wendell Mansions, Just above Shsri- dan Circle, on Massachusetts avenue. Mrs. Barklle expected to be here most of the winter; Iwr husband whenever business army business allowed. They wero here a week ago awaiting orders. Now Major Barklle Is sta tioned at Camp Meade just to keep him busy, apparently and Mrs. Bark lle has rented her lovely apartment and gono bock to Inver House 'at Wayne. Nobody seems to know what to ex pect of the Baruch and tho Stet,tlnlus families. Mr. Biruch has been here off and on. Mrs. Baruch and Miss Belle Baruch have scarcely been here nt all this season. But apparently they mean to be, for Miss Baruch' figures prominently on the various commlt- tees for tho Junior League ball on Nw Year's Eve. Mrs. Siettlnlus nnd Miss Isabel wero expected to spend most of the winter here but so far as I know have not been here except for a day or two en route from White Sul phur Springs to New York. Miss Betty Stettlnlus was not to have been here anyhow except for the holidays she's a college girl. Tho buds and the brides are having things pretty much their own way. But tho brides are uncertain In their prospects. The three most Inter esting are Barn Price Collier, who will marry Lieut. Charles Fellowes Gordon of H. M. 8. Warrior, next Saturday: Catherine Harlow, who Is to marry Ltoutenant - Commander Theodjro Stark Wilkinson 2d, on Tuesday, De cember 17, with a matron of honor, uk bridesmaids, ushers to match, and all the "trlmmlns" (which Is what you get Just now for picking an American), and Eleanora Morgan, whoso engage ment to Major Mnurlco Fitmaurlco D.iy of tho British War Mission was only announced last Sunday, with the statement that tho wedding would take place early In December. Mrs. Price Collier In setting Decem ber 14 as tho dato for Miss Collier's wedding, said frankly that it was the subject to change without notlco. For Lieut. Gordon Is Admiral Grant's Flag Lieutenant, nnd If tho Warrior should gut her sailing orders there might have to bo ii hurrv up wedding. Mrs. Mor gan Is In the samo position, M mbcrs of tho British" War Mission nra being sent homo every day, and no man knows when his turn will come. So It Is probable that Miss Morgan may bo married nt short notice. Just ns I'm going to press, word Is brought of the arrival of another mis sion. This ono Is from Japan, headed by H. I. H. Princo Admiral Hlgashl Fushiml. In tho absence of tho President tho Vice-President, who whether ho likes It or not seems to bo functioning to a degree at least ns President pro tern, will havo tho entertaining of them with tho udvico and assistance of Frank Polk, Counsellor of tho State Depart ment and Secretary of State pro tern.
