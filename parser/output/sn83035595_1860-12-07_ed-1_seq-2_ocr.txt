It is de sirable that all sums raised should be forward ed at once, and the best and safest way to re mit is through the Governor. In this connection we would take occasion to warn the public against unauthorized itin erant solicitors, who are tukiug advantage of the sympathetic feeling in behalf of the poor sufferers in blausas to advance their own in terests by imposing upon the people. Beware of such fellows, and if disposed to give any thing send it by mail, express or private hands directly te Governor Dennison, who will at once forward it to the committee duly author ized to receive and disburse it in Kansas. - ' The secessionists continue their demonstra tions in the Southern States, and that South Carolina will lead off in Disunion by attempt ing . to curry put her oft and long repeated threats during the pnscnt month, is not doubt ed. : Her Convention meets on the 17th, and its members will consist entirely of seccRsion BtSw .Tlieirr'sympathizcrs in ,othes Cot too States di'elarc those States will speedily fbf. luw.

The official result" m Virsi'mta shows the election of 9 Befl and 6 Breckinridge Elec' tore.
