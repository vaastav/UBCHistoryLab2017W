It will strengthen the intelligent faith of the people in his sound sense and sympathy plain, common-sensed, practical State pa- per, written for tho masse, and not alone for the erudition and astu teness which ex hibit their warrant of official power and distinction in the halls of Congress. It is not embarrassed w ith heavy English, nor beclouded by a multitude of words. .Webster's Dictionary was not ransacked from cover to cover nor has its massive unabridgement been levied upon the pa . llence of the reader. The school boy, the mecbanic, the la borer, the owner of the humblest home, can read it with the same understanding as the profound lawyer, the learned "pro fessor and the manof the most extensive literary accomplishments. It is an epi tome of the history of the country for the last year, Loth in regard to its domestic affairs and foreign relations, showing the real condition of our governmental con cerns, what we need and the proper poli cy of procuring the same. Whilst all these are set forth, the temptation to glittering elaboration is withstood, and the Message, a letter of the President to every household in the land, is a model of brevi ty and plain fpeating. The Prcsideut, in this respect, has ignored, with a manly contempt, the precedent set by his last "illustrious predecessor," the self-constituted Constitution-expounder for the pres ent century. The 3Iesage exhibits the action of the Administration in controlling tLe affairs of tho government in all its departments gratifying the country that the laws have ing St. Domingo, the articles on this point to be founded upon the celebrated speech TT yl 1 l1 i n oi iion. inaries oumner in Uongress on that irrepressible subject. The second allegation will be levying war against the Republic of Hayti,' with out just cause or the authority of Con gress. The third charge, infraction of the Dominician Constitution and our own in the treaty negotiations. Fourth, sustaining a usurper in power, and protecting the Dominician Presi dent against his own people by affording moral support of our guns. Fifth, failing to protect an American citizen and conniving at his imprison ment by the Baez- government lost he should prove an inconvenient obstacle to Grant's policy in the Antilles . Sixth, violation of the equality of na tions. In a word, belligerent intervention in the affairs of both San Domingo and Hayti, coptrary to the laws of nations and the Constitution and laws of , the United States. The combination is composed of all the Democrats in both houses of Congress and a few recalcitrant Republicans. We do not underrate Sumner's ability and . art fulness, but at the same time feel perfect ly cure, that the movement, of which he is the brains and iap iration. is doomed to an inglorious defeat. It is an attempt to thwart Grant's presidential aspirations. and had its origin in malice and sore dis appointment. The people are with the mi m . me inoune goes into almost every detail of the Message, and finds more to commend than to condemn. The Herald most thoroughly praises the Message, and says : " To sum up this Message, as an exposi tion of the doings of the Administration in the management of all the vast con cerns of the several Departments of the Government, on the land and the water, at borne and abroad, duringjtbe year which is now closing, it is a good exhibit of a faithful execution of the laws, an honest disposition of the public money and a rigid punishment of publie defaulters. In the next place, the Message in its recommenda- nry of tbejtfnited States, at tha request of spinner, is placed in the hands of a committee appointed " by Routwell. The investigation will consume several months. Meantime, there will be no interruption to business,, as the com mittee will, from 'day to day, supply Spinner with the funds needed for the day. Senate. Robertson introduced an Amnesty bill, which passed the House last session, with a recommendation that it pass. It v excludes officers of the nary and army and legislative offi cers, who went into ' the Confederate service. Sumner introduced a bill abolishing the Internal Revenue Bureau ; reducing all special taxes, and increasing the direct whisky tax to 80cts on the gal lon. There is a wide discussion as to whether it shall go to the table or to the committee, Sherman argues that it is unconstitutional for Senate to originate such a bill House.

The New York Post says : On the whole, however, the Message will be cer tainly more acceptable to the whole coun try than a much abler document could be from any man who, however original and eloquent, should be less direct in his meth- bcen faithfully executed, the public mo- ner0 of Vicksburg and the . Wilderness, ods, less simple in his views, and less en- their in the full niu- ney honestly dispotcd of, and all default ers rigidly punished. We refer to one portion of the Message, not to be found in our, extracts, which is polygamy in Utah. The President is de termined that this foul blot of iniquity t-hall no longer disgrace American civili zation. He thus defines his Mormon pol icy : "Neither polygamy nor any violation of existing statutes w ill be permitted within tho territory of the United States. It is not with the religion of the self-styled Saints that we are now -dealing, bnt with their practices. They will be pro tcted in tbe worship of God according to the dictates of their conscience ; but they wl' not be permitted to violate the laws under the cloak of religion." This is certainly explicit. As many Mormons have been arrested and some tried and convicted, and as their leader, Brigham Young has fled before tha terrors ofarenging justice, and with this assur anee from the Chief Magistrate that poly gMny ahall be suppressed, the moral and religious sontiment of the country will re joice with hope, that our national name and character arc no longer to remain a yponym of infamy for foster.ng and pro tecting such a crime. With an excusable pride and self-congratulation, tbe President refers to the amicable adjustment of our difficulties with England. Tho threatcnings of war ' with that Power wore more decided when proposition for a settlement of the Ala- Lama claims and the 1 i.hcry question waa made, than were signs of the interne cine conCict in our own land up to Presi dent Lincoln's election. The Adminis tration wasequalto the emergency, and, by its skill and diplomacy averted a con flict, which obstinacy on England's part would have provoked. The bloodless ettlement of those differences distinguish- and backed by by their good will and es teem, he will triumph over all obstacles. THE 

PEOPLE THE POWER. Public sentiment is the surest -and speediest corrective of public evils. The most notable evidence of this fact" is the prostration of the New York' City Tam many Ring. The next less, the forced resignation of Thomas Murphy, the Col- of the cge crgetic and business-like, in his official work than General Grant. The reader of this document feels safe against any serious rashness or fatal error on the part of the Administration. The Newark (N. J.) Advertiser says: It is nothing but a calm, cool-headed busi ness statement, which the humblest may understand, and by which the wisest may profit. Still it carries its lessons, and some of them are incident to the progress As the fierce young Judical lector of C uttoms for that Poit. The ar roused feelings of an honest populace ac complished both results. During the war Murphy was a hat contracto r. He swin dled tho government by palming oft" a stock composed of shellac and shoddy, and by this infamous rascality, realized $109, 000,00. As soon as this villainy was un earthed and spread before 'the people in the newspapers, the public clauiorings de manded a new Custom House officer for the principal Porfrof entry for the United States. It was an argument of logio and reason that if a man who would furnish a soldiery with hats that could not weather the first storm, could not safely be en trusted with handling public . funds. So the people in New York and everywhere else when Murphy's character was known, demanded his resignation or removal. Murphy seeing the coming storm grace fully resigned." Certainly, this is a tri umph of popular will over individual character, and promises well for the fu ture of the country. When a man proves himself dibhoncst throw him overboard, and pursuing this policy we are safe. becomes impressed with tbe gravest sense of responsibility the moment be is possessed of power, and so grows conservative, the soldier, the " man on horseback," is likely to be the most quiet and placable of statesmen.

SUPREME COURT. 5ince our last issue, Hon. T. A. R. . Nelson, one of our Supremo Judges, has resigned. ' Judge Shields was appointed by Governor-Brown to fill the vacancy, but declined. The Governor then tender ed the position to Hon. Robert McFarland, . of Morristown, who has accepted. Jndgo McFarland is ranked among the foremost lawyers of tho State. Having, at differ ent times, acted as temporary Judge of the Supremo Court, he has acquired the reputation, among his professional breth ren, of being an able and impartial Jurist, dispatching business with an unwearying rapidity. . It is due to Judge Nelson, upon his rctiracy to fay that he enjoys the entire confidence of the people, and most espe cially, of this community, of which ho was 0 long a member. Among us, his career as a law practictioner, covers over a quarter of a century, and whilst no ono doubts his legal attainments, all recognize his scru pulous honesty, integrity and honor- in the management. of cases at this bar.
