It is entitled "The Colored People lu their RelatUms to American Industry," and usserts the ?Mill and capacity of c4ilored labor, citing examples of both, demanding fair remuneration, full protection, ?uid equal right of appren? ticeship and employment with those enjoyed by white mechanics and laborers.

They only demand their right, and tiny will

Colored labor, It declared, would never Join in any movement that looked to repudi? ation, any moro than It would Join a political party bar? ing Unit on its banner.

ITS RECEPTION IIY THE PKESS. SKNSIIILE AM) I'l.AIN. ?/ruin The Uoiten AdTertiier. "Sensible" is tho epithet by which ninc tenths of it? readers will sum up their estimate of the President's Message. It is not brilliant] It has none of the picturesquo felicity of expres? sion which characterized all of Mr. Lincoln's publie documents; it n eijuully free from the aggressive personality aud violent egotism which permeated every ihlng coming from the last occupant of the presidential chair; it deals with plain facts In a plain way; and as thcro Is nothing In it which the humblest citizen can tall to under.?tumi, so tuero is nothing that the most ingenious enerr\r can torture into a meaning not intended. Tho President shows plainly enough that he bas not " abilb cated," but that ho holds the reins of his great ofllco with a firm hand, ami bus employed the comparative leisure of the recess In a careful and profitable study of the moat pressing needs of the nation. 

PRACTICAL AND STRAIGHTFORWARD. >I"Oj Tli? llul-.i J Polt, b. iwilJl.c. The first annual message of President Grant Is as devoid of rhetorical embellishment as is tho address of its author. It goes straight to business, and offers its suggestions and recom? mendations lu a strictly business way. ? ? ? The very practical and straightforward character of tho document will strike all readers forcibly. It contains no evidence of independent thinking or original views, but generally adopts those of ?secretaries and Senators. Yet It cm bo readily compreheuded, aud, If closed ou a rather low key, will be takeu us the address of a plain man to Cougress, made in tho plainest manner. Its brevity is a merit, which a merely business communication should always aim to possess.

DISSATISFIED KKl'LHUCAN. I ruiu Tlie Oocu.oetl t'oaim?rci?l. President Grant has prodooed a longer mes <;i,i' ami ?me inoro ambitious In Its scope and style than was expected. The expressions of his pride In "this great nation," and gratitude that It Is notas other nations ure. night have been modified with advantage, on the s. oi,-of good taste. There is a personal consciousness, too, ?ropplng out in tho message, hardly In harmony with the charucter of a simple and modest soldier. It was not Important to say that certain countless blessings and all that sort of thing, with which Fourth of July literature has familiarized us, are "submitted to your can'and mini-." The message euds In tho same strain. Wo fear there Is In the Presidential, as iu most uuolllcial mind?, a condition that approaches confusion concerning the flnenelsl questions. Tho President don't want Im? mediate resiimptiou of specie payments, for that would tie hard on the debtor clues, but he Is against uncertainty lu values. We fear tho i'resideut's education has been a little neglected right here. He eurnestly recommends that which is utterly lmprac Ueshle. Congress has the same power to put au Imme? diate stop to the fluctuations In tho value of.currency that it has to put an immediate stop to the fluctuations m the price of com or cotton, ?ir to tho riso and fulrof tho waters of the Atlantic. He means, however, In geuoral, that we should move in the direction of speciu payments, anil in that ho Is sound. The observations of the Presi? dent on Cuban uftulrs are clear and Just. Tho language of the message telatlng to the negotiations with Great Britain Is considerate and dignifica, and will be generally approved. ? mic thing, however, seems to us open to ob metion, The President could not have expected that England was likely to ajHilogizc to us for the sentiments her people entertained as to the war of tho Rebellion lu this country. Concerning tho French Cable, the Presi? dent has been unduly Influenced by tho New-York Asso cioted Press. ? * ? I'pon the tariff questiou tho Chief Magistrate will bo fourni pleasing to the In? terests that suppose themselves to be protected. At long as nine tenths of the people think It a tine thing to be taxed for the special advantage of tbe other tenth, and cail it protection of American industry, we suppose Ills all right. TUS

Its linaneial and currency propositions are the new funding of the bouda at ?| per cent iuteiest, and the tiling of the coin value of tho greenback currency, not ut its face, but at a fair current price. It is thus slated: "To authorize tho Treasury to redeem Its owu puttSt at a fixed price when presented." This woubl at once stop all speculation iu gold, and a stability would at Ones be given to tho currency. This would reet4irc specie puymi'Ut without any disturbance of values. Wo ought to believe Una the best plau yet presented, for we have eurnestly advocated it. To fix the value of the currency where It Is would do no injustice to anybody, uud on that value specie pat incut could bo resumed at one?? without dist?rbanos, wo hope that the Isflnsneo of the 1'reanlem will concentrate legislative opinion on u plan founded ou this prluclple of jiietly llxing tho value of the curieucy SBVBBAL KXi'KPTlnNs takkn.

MdXTKViDF.o, Oct. 14.?The uneasiness of tho Ar ireiitiiies and Uruguayans respecting tlio ultimate? designs of Urazil in the present war seems to increase from day to day, and tho pros of botli tho form?e countries is clamoring loudly for a rupture of the alliance beforo their indepeiidcuco ia hopelessly com? promised. Tho Brazilian Ministry lately made annfli cial announcement in tho Chambers that tho war with Paraguay was over: yet the War Ofllce haa just called for 60,000 men, and we m the neighboring licpublics are incpiiritiK, what they are wanted for. There has always been a strong party opposed to the war, but all classes now seem to have taken the alarm. El Mercantil del Plata of this city Bays : " Even the journal? which, sustain tho governmeut of Sr. ?Sarmiento are at last obligedlo confess that tho alliance is covering with* lasting infamy in tho eyes of history the powers which have combined and participated in tho great crime of exterminating with Gro and sword a brother. people?That tho authority, born in crime, which* calls itself the Orieutal Government, and which ia merely the expression of the will of l?rnzil, should ac? cept and continue th?i policy of the alliance, is easy enough to understand ; but that tho Govern? ment of tho Argentine Republic, which purports to emanate from the will of the people, should volun? tarily accept the legacy of Mitre, and declare itsell the successor of that political traitor, is a thing which can only bo explained by the corruption of tha dominant party in the republic." El Mo de la Plata, after denouncing in unmeasured terms the in? terference of the allies with the affairs of Para? guay, and observing that tho Paraguayan peo? ple received them, " not as liberators, but as soldiers of conquest," warns it readers that "a strict compliance with international law is the only guar? anty which weak nations possess against tho aggressions of tho strong. What resistance," it goon onto ask, "can we oppose to injustice to-morrow, if we have violated the principles of right which) might have been appealed to in our favori G rare dangert menace us. Let us try to avoid] them in time." ?Stop tho war, aud break the alliance} this is tho almost universal cry. In the midst of this excitement a queer story comes to light showing how Brazil has made herself tha supreme ruler of Paraguay while pretending to iu-. trust tho administration to a Provisional Govern? ment at Asuncion.
