Ftllcw-Citizens rf th Stnnte And lluuse of Representatives : Since your last annual asiernbjnjr, an other year of health and bountiful harvela baa passed ; and while it l as not pleased tho Almighty to bless us with a return of peace, we ran but prei on, gnided by the best light He gives us, trusting (hat in Ilin own good time and wise ways, ail will be well. The correspondence touching foreign af fairs, which has taken place during the Ul year, is herewith submitted, in virtual coin- tdiance with a request to that effect, made v the House of ltepresentaiives, near the efoo of the last session of Congress. If the condition of our relations with other nations is less gratifying than it has usually been at former period, it is certainly more ati factory than a nation so unhnppily di.-tresed as we are might reasonably have apprehend wu. in iuu raonin oi uune jiji, t tie re wtie some grounds to expect that the maritime Powers, which, at the beginning of our do mestic difficulties, so unanimously and un necessarily, a we think, lecoguized the in surgents as a belligerent, would soon recede from that positiou, which has proved only less injurious to themselves than to our own country ; but the temporary revtrt-es which atterward helell the national arms, which were exaggerated by our own dis loyal children abroad, have hitherto delayed the act of simple justice. The civil war, which Las so radically changed, for the moment, the occupation and habits of the American paople. has and abroad, aome from interested motives, , the burden of that part of the public debt ethers upon patriotic considerations, and employed as securities.

This attack was wholly unex pected, and, therefore, no means of denfense had been provided. It is estimated that not less than 600 persons were killed by the Indians, and a large amount of property wfcS destroyed. How this outbreak was induced is not definitely known, and suspi dons, which may be unjist, need not be stated. Information was received by the Indian Bureau' from different sources, alut the time hostilities were commenced, that a simultaneous attack was to be made upon the white settlements by all the tribes be tween the Mississippi River and the Rocky MonnUins.

It is an occa-iou of special pleasure to acknowledge that the execution of it on the part of Her AfajVty's Government has been marked by a jealous respect for tbe authority of the United States and the rights of their moral and loyal cit iiena. The Convention with Hanover for the abolition of tho Stadt dues has been carried into full effect under the act of Congress for tuat purpose. A blockade of three thousand miles sea-coast could not be established and orously enforced in a season of trreat com mercial activity like the present without committing occasional mistakes and mulct ing unintentional injuries upou foreign na tions and their subjects. A civil war oc curring io a country where foreigners resido and carry on trade, under treaty stipula tions, is necessarily fruitful of compliant of tne violation of neutral riguts. All such collisions tend to excite misapprehensions, and possibly, to produce mutual reclama tions between nations which have a common interest in preserving peace and friendship. In clear cases of these kinds, I have, so far aa possible, heard and redressed complaints which have leeu presented by friendly powers. There is, however, a large an i augmenting number of doubtful cases, upon which the Government is unable to agree with the Governments "whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are, moreover, many cases in which the United States or their citisens suffer wrongs from the naval or military authorities of other nations, which tha Governments of these States are not at onos prepared to redress. 1 have proposed to soma of the foreign States thus interested, mutual conventions to examine and adjust such complaints.

It is of the first im portance to duly consider and estimate this ever enduring part. That portion of the earth's surface which is owned and inhabi ted by the people of the United Stales is well adaptad to be the home of one nation al family, and it is not well adapted to two or more. Its vast extent aud its variety of climate and production are of advantage iu this age for one people, whatever they might have beeu in former ages. Steam and tele graph, in intelligence, have brought these to be an advantageous combination for one uni ted people. In my Innaugural Address, I briefly poin ed out the lo'al inadequacy of disunion as a lemedy for the difference between the people of the two sections. 1 did so in language which I can not improve, and which, therelore, I beg to repeat: '-One section of our country beleives slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the olher believes it is wrong and ought jpot to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute. The Fugitive Slave clause of the Constitution and the Isw for suppression ol the African slave trade are each as well en forced, perhaps, as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the al strife springs not from our permanent part, not from the land we inhabit, not from onr national homestead. There is no possi ble severing of this, but would multiply, and not mitigate, evils among us. In all its ad aptations and aptitudes, ii demands union abhors separation. In fact, it would ere long force reunion, however much of blood and treasure the separations to ourselves, to the passing generations of men, and it cannot, without convulsion, be hushed for ever with the passing of one generation. In this view, I reoommend the adoption of the following resolution and articles amend atory of the Constitution of the United States: Resolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of If so, the measure would save mor.ey, and, in that view, would be a prudent and eco nomical measure. Certainly, it is not so easy to pay some'hicg as it is to pay noth ing. But it is easier to pay a large sum than it is to pay a larger one, and it is easier to pay any sum, when we are able, than it is to pay it before we are able. The war re quires them at once. 1 he aggregate sum necessary for compensated emancipation progresses. This might not, and probably would not, close before the end of the thirty, seven years. At that time we shall proba bly have 100.0(H), 000 of people to share tbe burden, instead of Sl.POO.OOO, as now; and, not only so, bnt the increase of our popula tion may be expected to continue for a long time after the period as rapidly as before, because our territory will not have become full. I do not state this inconsiderately. At the same ratio of increase which we have maintained, on an average, from our first National Census in 1790 until that of i860, we should, in 1900, have a population of 103,208,4 Ifi, and why may we not contin ue that ratio far beyond that period? Our abundant room, our broad National home stead, is oar ample resource. Were our ter ritory as limited as the British Isles, very certainly our population coutd not expand as stated. Instead of receiving the foreign born, as now, we should be compelled to send part of the native born i.way; but such America, in Congress assembled, two-thirds ' is not our condition. We have 2.963.000 square miles. Europe has 3,800,000, with a population averaging seventy. three and one-third persons to a square mile.

' The proposed emancipation would short en the war, perpetuate peace, insure this increase of the population and proportion- the law of increase is. Assuming that it will continue, it gives the following results: 1870. 42.323,341 j 1880.56.967,216; 1 890, 76.677.872; 1900. 103,208,415; 1910, 133.918.526 ; 1920. IS6.984.335; 1930. 251.630,914. These figures show that oar country may be aa Epaloas as Europe now is, at some point tween 1920 aed 1930, say about 1926 merely authorizes Congress to aid in colon ixing such as may consent. This ought not to be regarded aa objectionable on tha one) hand or on the other, inasmuch as it comes to nothing unless by mutual consent of the people to ba deported and tha American voters, through their representative in Con grass. .Hji ti ; ' I cannot make it better known than it al ready is thai I strongly favor colonisation, and yet I wish to say there is aa objection urged against the colored persons remaining in the country which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious. It is insisted that their presence would injure and dis place white labor and white laborers. If there ever could be a proper time for aeere arguments, that time surely ia not now. In times like tba present man shonld niter nothing for which they wonld not be will ingly responsible through time and eternity. Is it true, then, that colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves? If they stay in their old places, they jostle no white la borers. If they leave their old plaoes. they leave them open to white laborers. Logi cally, there is neither more nor leas of it. Emancipation, even, without deportation, would probably enhance the wages of white labor, and very surely would not reduce them. Thus the customary amouat of la bor would still have to be performed. The freed people wonld surely not do more than their old proportion of it, end very proaba- bly for a time, would do less, leaving an la-, creased part to while laborers, bringing their ' labor into great demand, and consequently enhancing the wages of it. With deporta ' tion, even to a limited extent, enhancing wages to white labor is mathensatioally cer tain. Labor is like any other commodity in tbe market; increase the demand for it and you increase tbe price for it. Bed nee f ihe supply of black labor by colonising tbe black laborers out ot the country, and evt precisely so much you increase the demand of, and wages for, white labor.. Bat it ia r dreaded that the freed people will swarin forth and cover the whole land. Are they ' not already in the land? Will libeiation make them any more numerous? Squally distributed among the whites of the whole country, there would be but one colored to seven whites. Could the one in any way greatly disturb the seven? ... .. t --u-.t There are many communties now having more than one free colored person te seven whites, and tbi without any apparent con- ' scicusnesa of evil from it. The District of Columbia, and the StaUs of Maryland and Delaware, are all in this condition. The"' District has more than one free colored per son to eix whites; and yet in its frequent petitions to Congress, I believe it has nevet presented tbe presence of free colored per- ' sons as one of its griv.aoes. But ' why should emancipation South , send the freed people North! People of any color seldom ran unless there be some- ' thing to run from. Heretofore, colored - people to some extent have fled North from bondage, and now perhaps from both boa- " dage and destitution; but if gradual eman ' cipatton or deportation be adopted, they - will have neither - to nee from. Their old' masters will give them wag s, at least until . new laborers can be procured, and the freed men in turn will gladly give their labor tor the wages till new homes can be found for th in in congenial slimes and with people of their own b'ood and race. This proportion can be trusted to the mutual ibterets involved, and ia any event, can not tbe North decide for itself w he thee to receive them? Again, as practice provee more than theory in any case, has there' been any irruption of colored people North- " ward because of the abolishment of alavery in thU district last spring? What I have said of tbe proportion of free colored persons to tbe whites io the district is from tbe Censas of 1860, hatioar . f . , . . no reierence to persons cauea contrabands, - : nor to those made free bv aet of Contra abolishing slavery here. Tbe plan consist- ing of these articles is recommended, not. but that a restoration of the National thority would be accepted without ita adop tion, nor that the war. nor the proeeediage' " , under the Proclamation of September 22d, ' 1862, will be stayed because of the reeeea- " meodation of this plan.
