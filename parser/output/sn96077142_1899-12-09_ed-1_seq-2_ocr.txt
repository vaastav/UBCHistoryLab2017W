CAUCUSES ARE HELD. Republlrans Nam Col. Henderso for Speaker 11U Opponent Is llleliardson, of Tennessee. Washington, Die. 4. When the Fifty sixth congress assembles to-day both senate -and house will be prepared for the transaction of business as soou as new members can be sworn in and the work of the republican house caucus Salurday night indorsed by a formal call of the roll. Col. David B. Hender son (la.) was selected for speaker by acclamation. The democrats Saturday afternoon selected James D. Richard son (Tenn.) as their candidate for speaker after a contest which lasted through six ballots. There w as not even an echo of dissent to the programme that was fixed in so unusual a manner last summer by the republicans. Col. Henderson made a brief speeeh. Alexander McDowell, of MR. HENDERSON. Pennsylvania, nnd Henry Cnsson, of Wisconsin, were elected clerk and ser geant nt arms, respectively. Joseph C. McElroy, of Ohio, will be postmaster and Rev. Henry C. Coundcn, of Michi gan, chaplain of the house. The extraordinary thing the caucus did do was to perfunctorily consent to the readoption for temporary purposes of the Reed rules. Col. Hepburn, who was expected to make n fisrht on these rules, failed to do so, ond it was taken for granted that his promise to the president ucted as a permanent check upon his desire to restore the old par liamentary rules, under which the house worked previous to Reed's reg ime. The immediate result of this at tempt to revive the eld rules will prob ably be a bitter nnd prolonged fight on the floor of the house. There was nothing perfunctory about the democratic caucus.' It began with n light over the selection of a chairman. Representative Hay (Vn.) was the choice of the younger members, who happen to be in the mnjority. His op ponent wns Mr. McRae (Ark.) Mr. Hay won. Representative Jnmes D. Richardson Tenn.) wns chosen for leader of the MR. 

RICHARDSON. minority after six ballots had been taken, and Representative Sulzer (X. Y.) withdrew in his favor. Bankhead (Ala.) withdrew during the fourth bul lot without specifying who his friends ought to vote for, but they nearly all flocked to Richardson. The contest opened up so evenly thnt it looked hard to pick tiie winner. Bankhead had 34; De Armond ,(Mo.), 39; Richardson, 43, and Sulzer, 25. There were unimpor tant variations from these figures dur ing the succeeding ballots until the flnnl roll call disclosed that Richardson had 90 nnd De Armond, who remained in the fight to the finish, 47.

Washington. Dee. 4. The annual report of the secretary of the navy. Just made pub lic, Is a document of unusual Interest, deal Ins; not only with the work of the navy during the past year and Important recom mendations for the future, but also dis cussing the more Important questions re lating to the navy, Including the authori sation of 18 new warships, the Imperative need of special legislation In tho early days of congress for armor of the best quality that can be obtained and the prop osition that the thanks of congress be given to the commander-in-chief of th North Atlantlo squadron and to the ofli eers and men under his command for the part they took In the naval operations at Santiago. The secretary urges President McKinley to call congress' attention to the valorous deeds of tho North Atlantic squadron to the end that Rear Admiral Sampson and the men under him may have at least equal honor with Admiral Dewey and his sup porters at the battle of Manila. He sug gests presentation of medals of honor, to the brave men. These larger Items of the report receive extended attention at the hands of Sec retary Long. As to the Increase of the navy he says: "Tho number of large, swift and power ful armored cruisers of great coal endur ance in our navy Is largely disproportionate to the rest of the naval establishment. Tho experience of the last year has also shown the need of several smaller vessels usually classed as gunboats. It is there fore recommended that congress be re quested to authorize the construction of the following vessels: "First. Three armored cruisers of about 13,000 tons' displacement, of a maximum draught of deep load net to exceed 6 feet, carrying the heaviest armor and most pow erful ordnance for vsselp of their class, to be so sheathed anir-poppered as to have the highest practicable speed and greatest radius of action. "Second. Twelve gunboats of about 800 tons' trial displacement, to be sheathed and coppered. "And, third, as recommended a year ago, three protected cruisers of about S.ouO tons' trial displacement, carrying the most powerful ordnance for vessels of this class, to be sheathed and coppered and to have tha highest possible speed and great radius of action." The secretary adds In this connection thnt the S,noo-ton protected cruisers are consid ered butter adapted to the present needs of the navy than the 6,000-ton ships rec ommended last year. He also asks that If satisfactory bids cannot be obtained for tho new ships authority be given to build them at the United States r.avy yards. Concerning armor for warships the sec retary says: "The most important ques tion pertaining to r.aval construction at the present time, and one that demands prompt attention. In that of the armor for vessels now building and for others authorized but not yet contracted for on account of the provision in the act of March 3, lSlill, pro hibiting the department from contracting for the vessels therein authorized until contract has been made for the armor therefor within $3u0 a ton. The price fixed Is one for which even Inferior armor can not be obtained, and the department has therefore been unable to Invite proposals for the three battleships and tho three armored cruisers authorized by the act of March 3, The secretary then shows that ",3."s tons of armor are needed for the battleships Maine, Ohio and Missouri, about 9,000 tons for the new battleships not yet begun and about 5,100 tons for the ar mored cruisers already authorized, a total of about 21,458 tons. He says that $400 a ton probably will buy armor made by tho ordinary process of face hardening, which, though good, is not the best, and the de partment does not therefore consider It suitable for vessels of the Maine class. After pointing cut tho features of the new process of making armor and its adoption by leading maritime nations except the United States, the secretary says: "Tho department desires to make use of such armor for the vessels now building which are yet unsupplied with armor, and for the armored vessels authorized and not yet contracted for." His recommendation Is as follows: "It Is urgently recommended that In the early days of lt. next session congress enact such special legislation, by Joint resolution or otherwise, as may be necessary to enable tho department to make contracts early In the coming year for 7,358 tons of armor of the best quality that can be obtained In this country for tha Maine, Ohio and Mis souri, and that the provision of the act of March 3, 1M9, limiting the price of armor to 1500 per ton, and the restriction prevent ing the armored vessels therein authorized from being contracted for until the armor therefor Is contracted for, be removed. Whatever may be the future action of con gress regarding the establishment of a gov ernment armor factory, It can hardly affect the supply of armor for the Maine, Ohio and Missouri, as It will under any circum stances be Impracticable to obtain It from such a source In reasonable time to com plete the vessels above referred to." Secretary Long refers to the return of Admiral Dewey and his enthusiastic wel come from the whole country. After speak ing of the New York reception and the sword presentation In Washington the sec retary sums up by saying It was the na tion's tribute. Among the many other topics treated Is that for fostering the naval reserve, the consolidation of the naval bureaus of con struction, engineering and equipment In the Interest of more harmonious action: the construction of barracks for enlisted men, and a review of the various bureau recom mendations, the desirability of changing the material of the League Island and the Mare Island dry dork from timber to stone and concrete. The warships claiming bounty and prize money from their cap tures and engagements during the war are set forth In detail. He says the survey of the trans-I'acillc cable route Indicates that it will be en tirely practicable. It Is Intended also to survey a cable route from Guam to Yoko hama, j't is proposed to supply all new ships with smokeless powder. The 12 inch gun has been so greatly developed that It has been designated as the heaviest gun for the latest battleships, Instead of the 13-Inch gun. Many Improvements In naval ordnance are under way, Including uniform caliber for small arms and machine guns. Work on the design of gunboat No. 18 to replace the Michigan on the great lakes has been suspended pending negotiations with Great Krltaln for a modification of the treaty. Secretary Long reviews also the various, naval Incidents of the last year. V The secretary gives a table showing naval construction going on abroad, as compared with that In the United States. Prom this It appears that only Italy and Japan laid down less tonnage than this country during the present year, and that Italy alone hnd less tonnage under construction. The total tonnage under construction Is: England, S'il.esu; France. 55,533: Germany, 148.255; Italy, 120.B4O; Japan. 130,000: Russia, 223.9'it: United States, 123,236.
