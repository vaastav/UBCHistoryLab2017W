Cheatham introduced aibill- to pro servo 'tho' credit Sif the-State.The' bill provides for funding tho interest on tho State debt up to July 1, 1870, the bonds to bear six per cent interest, and to be re deemed at tho pleasure of the State after three years.

State js pledged to givo priority in tho paymeriof tho interest on those bonds, over any other bonds of tho State, out of tho interest to be -paid by railroads, jind ,out. of.nny money' in! the .Treasury applicabW to in terest. Bills were also introduced by Mr. Steelo, to provide for tho erection and govern ment of county workhouses and lesson the number of convicts for the Ponitontiary ; and by Mr. McElwec, for the management of the. Penitentiary. Mr.Shorrol offered a resolution to pre vent the newspaper called tho "Soldiers' Gazette" from being deposited on tho desks of members. The resolution was laidmpon, tho. table.

MoDocoal, Esq., has been nominated to represent McNalry county in th6 'Constitutional Convention. The Jackson Tribune claims that Mr. Mc Doug.il is opposed to negro suffrage. The New j-York" I'ost, a Republican journal, notes tho fact that the President's message, has nothing about any further acquisition of territory, and adds: "Let us hope, therefore, that the rumors ubout the 'acquisition' of San Domingo are false. Wc do not need any more unedu catcdund semi-barbarous citizens."' 'iEflE 'Washington correspondent if the Cincinnati Gazelle thinks some dissatis fied Republicans in the House of Repre sentatives will oppose the repeal of the tenurc-of-oDice law, still he thinks the repealing bill will pass, but adds, "What its fate will "be when it reaches the Senate five or sis weeks hence, , no one can yet teH." The "Washington correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazelle says the indications are that Secretary Boutwell's recommen dation for contraction at the rate of two millions per month, will not find many sup porters. The demand from the West and South ;for more money is so strong that Congress will not undertake to contract the currency. Me. Sr.MSEJt introduced a bill in the Senate last week jproviding for a national free banking syjslem, and yesterday a bill for a like purpose "was introduced in the House of Representatives. The feeling in favor of such a system is said to lc in creasing in Congress, and the indications ajpJhaUt'Willbe established. If wc are to have a paper currency, why cannot the government give it to us v ithout the aid of these shaving shops? Me. S. P. Rowan is a-caudid.Htc in Blount county for delegate to the Consti tutional Convention. He is in favor of extending the franchise to every male citizen, without regard to color, and not convicted of crime; favors negroes paying a poll tax as mil as white people; but is opposed to vesting the appointment of Judges and . Attorneys General in the Governor or IheXcgislature. Tn Ens are two candidates in Madison county for delegate 1o the Constitutional Convention, Gen. A. W. Campbell and Hon. Milton Brbwiii In a speech at Jackson on the Cth inst, the former took ground against negro suffrage. The po sition tf the latter is Sated by the Jack son Whig aa follows : "On the quo-lion of negro Mill rage Judge Brown thought the convention should not take final action, but should provide for its settlement by the first Legislature that assembles after the adop tion or rejection of the amended constitu tion; and that in the election of members to the Legislature the question of suffrage should be voted for fceparateby.'' i - - - Tns Judiciary Committee of the United States Senate lias agreed upon a bill pro viding for the reassembling of the Georgia Legislature, the exclusion of the members of that body ineligible under the fourteenth amendment, and the reseating of the negro members who were expelled be cause the constitution adopted by a Radi cal Constitutional Convention and formally ratified by such of the people of Georgia, White and black, as were allowed to vote, W1dth1 them inducible. The bill further declares the Legislature to be provisional, cntil the Senators and Representatives loom Georgia are admitted to Congress. The telegraph docs not inform us what the Judiciary Committee propose to do with the acta of the Legislature since the State was formally admitted to Congress. This biclnhanded usurpation will prob ably bo ratified "by the Radical majority in Congress, and we shall then present to the world the spectacle of Congress dis mantling a Slate because the people have dared to oppose the party in power in that body. Should the Radicals tucceed in reducing Georgia to a provisional exist once, we presume Tennessee will be the next State attacked. A mix passed the House of Represen tatives at the last session of Congress and the Senate a few days ago, removing tho disabilities of several hundred citizens of the Southern States, among whom are the following Tcnncsseeans : a B. Davis, of Lawrence county: .-Hiram CrabUve, John R. Knight and John .Tones, of Jackson county ; Edward Iwtac Gulladay and R. E. Thompson, of "Wilson couniy ; Robert Farquaharson, of Lincoln comity ; James Huss, of Bedford count v ; John Allev, of Sequatchie county; J.Jin E. Pvatt. J. C. AVasson, "W. N. Ault, and .T."L. Abernalhy, of Rhea county, Stephen Matthews of Blount county; H. S. Young, of Mrcou county; Waller It. Evans, of ClaiHornc county; John P. Mum-, William 11. Bolts, and Allen De Witt," of Jarkxin county; James Monroe Meek, of Jefferson county, and James H. Randolph of Cocke county. Stephen Matthews, James Monroe Meek and James II. ltandoli were members of the "Rebel" Legislature of 18fil-'C2, but thtiy have Ijccii good Radicals since that party sprung op in this State. Meek and Randolph were candidates at the judicial c'eJtTori.lasirinsfoE Judge of the second circuit, and the latter was elected. He was qualified and has been discharging the duties of the office. j TAX

Since" iheljbnvenihg of obrpresenVLegisla ture, -whenever an article has.heen rwritlen by the one, immediately the c6mbatlveness of the other has been aroused, antiwar made byctlie latter upon the positions of the former, and vice versa, neither con sidering, .that, by possibility their" interests are Jdentipai; neither scjenung to know or, appreciate the fbr.;e of the old adage, as . truo as bid: "United we stand; divided wo fall," This is of the earth, earthy Thero is neither moral philoso phy nor political economy in this war of sections which ought to be friends. The same practical fiVBtem of finances which saves th6;lndiyidual, will, if suc cessful in its, .operation, preserve tho State. This is the true inductive, Baconian system,, leading Iron'); individual premises to general conclusions. The Bondholder 6ays, "Pay me what thou owest." nc too often demands what is nominated in the bond. Among commercial men, whenever one of them cannot respond to tho day, an arrange mcnt'is made .by which time is given liim to marshal up his assets, to gather up the odds and ends of business, and prepare for a fair and square settlement. When he docs that, all is well. He begins busi ness again. Is still a useful member of society. Contributes his energy, his business capacity to the commercial community. He continues a live member of the busi ness circle. He contributes to the health, wealth and prosperity of the Slate, and to the general good. Why may not this be so, between States or between States and individual debtors and creditors ? To come directly to the case in point : Tennessee, by the fortunes, or misfortunes, of war, is overwhelmingly in debt; primarilyorsccondarily. Noparade of figures, no torturing of reports can conceal that fact, either from ourselves or from our creditors. It is best for us to look facts in the face. "We have a large amount of our bonds out. "We have en dorsed largely, and upon these endorse ments we are, in the estimation of the commercial world, primarily responsible. We have borrowed money and pledged still other bonds as collaterals to secure the payment of the money thus borrowed. The day of maturity has arrived and still no funds to redeem our collaterals, and they arc liable to be sacrificed. Wc have not paid our July interest. We cannot pay our January interest. To add still further to our difficulties and embarrassment, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided that the tax collectors and all other public officers shall receive Bank of Tennessee notes (old issue) for all taxes and other moneys due the State. Under all these circumstances, terrible in the extreme, what shall we do? We confess a diffidence in our own judgment. We have sought the company and asked the views of both bond holders and tax-payers, railroad men and anti-railroad men. Still wc find doubt and uncertainty in every thing about us, growing more, perhaps, out of the combativeness of human nature than the unreasonableness of any of the positions assumed. Wc have hesitated to take position directly on any of the many propositions before the Legis lature. But something must be done to relieve us. We respectfully sug gest that the best thing which can be done for the tax-payer, the bond holder, the railroad and the State, is, First: Repeal the law requiring the rail roads to pay into the Treasury of the State the Sinking Fund. If not, the la.it remaining one will "O into the hands of a Receiver, from which "deliver us." Secondly. Fund the interest which has not and it is evident cannot be met when due. Thirdly. Permit the railroads to retire their indebtedness with State liabilities of any order or series, dollar for dollar, and issue, if necessary, first mortgage bonds to enable them to do so. This will bring in the bonds and coupons, etc., upon w hich wc are liable, enable the State grapple with its debt, save us from repu diation and place us once more on the high road to prosperity. to The movement in the Senate yesterday, under the bill of Senator Cooper, of Bed ford, gives promise that the Penitentiary question may reach an early solution. Our reporter furnishes a summary of its main features. When this important bill shall (as it will be by order) printed, we mav take occasion to review it. For the present, we can ouly say that its general provisions appear to be judicious. The seventh section seems to deal with the rights or the lonner lessees some what abruptly, as the matters involved are now the subject of litigation, or, at least, in a condition to become so. Ten dayV notice to remove machinery whicl it required monthsto erect, with power to condemn and enter on possession in case of failure or refusal, is applying tho legis lative sword to the Gordian knot. How ever, it is not to be presumed that tho bill is intended to Wish matters to a settle ment by measures of oppression. We hope to see the affairs of this in stitution for the past few years adjusted and settled .fairly to all parties, and in a manner fully to secure the interests of the State ; and to sec it also placed upon a basis for the future which shall make it self-sustaining, and, in the language of ilm bill, cause it to cease to be "a drain on the State Treasury." It seems that the internal revenue offi cers all over the country have been lining their pockets. Supervisor Dutdier, of New York, writes to Commissioner Delano that a practice prevails to a conuuieraoie extent in his district by the revenue offl cersof ckargingforthcirscrviccsinmaking out papers that the law requires the tax mvers to furnish, and asks if such offi cers have a right to do it. Mr. Delano replies that the practice cannot be sanc tioned by the revenue office and must not be permitted to prevail, and that all inter nal reenuc officers who have taken money for such purposes and who refuse to refund the same at once, will w dis missed from the service. iio.-s. j.o. n. riEJiiN:. We ragrct our inability to publish in full this morning the speech of the Rep resentative from Knox on the Cincinnati and Chattanooga railroad question, ddiv credin the House yesterday. "We hear it extolled by both the friends and oppo nents of the measure as the finest specimen of logic and eloquence to which the House has listened during the present session. Tho Representative from Hamilton, Mr. James, has the floor to-day on the same subject, but upon the opposite side. Ma!sy ofpur citizens will -remember the. excitementKcauseil .bV the report " that Grant hail iss"ueuanorder just ueTore'thtf battle.o Nashville relieving Gen. Thomas P-r .appointing John A. Logan, of lUiaohv t0 ake command of the Army of the Cumberland. It was also reported iitCEogaffihad-got aa far las Louisville, When Grant! learning of Thomasuccess, countermanded his previous order. These rumors' created intense' excitement and in dignation among." the 'soTdiers under the" vfetorious Thomas. A correspondent o the Chicago Tribune has now- written a description. oiE.au interview between Gens. Halleck and Thomas, which he, jays took place in San Francisco just be fore the former relinquished Ids command of that department. Hallcclr, he says, explained to Thomas, on .(hat occasion, the history of the affair, Grant, impatient of Thomas' delay in" at tacking Hood, issued Ihe order, but Hal ' leek put it in his pocket for three days, thus giving Thomas an opportunity to light Hood and beat him, and then the or der was rescinded. John M. Schofleld, not John A. Logan, was the officer named to succeed Thomas, and the well-known friendship of Grant for Schofleld is quoted ! in confirmation of the story. THE 

ISAIW OF TENNESSEE ANI TAXES. Mr. D. N. Kennedy, candidate in Montgomery county for delegate to the Constitutional Convention, publishes a card in the Clarksville Chronicle, in which he says : "The Supreme Court of the United Stales has decided that the State of Ten nessee is bound to receive the notes of the Bank of Tennessee for taxes; hence the necessity of making some provision for their redemption. As these notes have generally passed out of the hands of the peoplo, tho original holders; and at very low rates, and aro now hdd by specula tore mostly persons living out. of the State who pay no taxes here, I am in favor .of their redemption at the lowest possible cost to the people. I would, therefore, in levying the Stale tax, provide that it may be discharged by the payment in United States or National Bank currency, of one-half the amount levied ; thus make it the interest of the tax-payers to pay in this currency, and leave the Bank of Tennessee notes in the hands of the present holders to be taken up by the bank, from its debtors, in pay ment of debts due and in train of collec tion, and for real estate now owned and held by the bank, which will absorb the larger part of the circulation. The amount not redeemed in one of the ways suggested, should be provided for by an issue of the bonds of the State at par. Under no circumstances would I favor the sale of the bonds to redeem the notes of the Bank of Tennessee, or the receiving of said note3 for taxes on the same basis as United States currency." THE CI1 

INESE. There is quite a furious newspaper warfare going on among the native Amer icans of California, upon the subject of Chinese immigration. One party strong ly favoring; the other as strongly oppos ing. We are too far off to judge cor rectly of the merits of the question. But we find in the recent annnal report of the Coroner of San Francisco the subjoined extract, which, if true, relieves us of any distress because of the absence of John Chinaman from our midst. Speaking of the Chinese, the Coroner says : " I beg leave to call your attention to these people: the filth of most of their hab'tations cannot be described. I have sec j a family of a woman and six children living in a room not larger than six by ten feet, with a child dead from small pox w rapped in rags and placed under a bench to get it out of the way. " I respectfully invite your attention to the condition of these people. It is well worthy of your serious consideration, not only from the filthy condition in which they live, the neglect they undergo from their own people when they are sick and no longer able to work, but because they are accumulating in our almshouses and lunatic asylums. While they are able to work, they are looked after by the com panies which have imported them ; but when they become sick, imbecile or dan gerously insane, they are left to them selves to lie on a piece of matting and diej or are discarded by their own coun trymen, taken up by the authorities and sent to the almshouse or lunatic asylum. The companies who bring these people here should be compelled to take care of them when they are unable to take care of themselves. BEAU 1N3IIND. The election for delegates to the Con stitutional Convention occurs next Satur day, and the people throughout the State should bear in mind that by the act of Dec. 1, 18G9, every voter is required to vote in the civil district or ward in which he resides. The following is the first scc tion of the law : "Be it enacted by the General As sembly of the Stale of Tennessee, That all voters in this State shall be required to vote in the civil district or ward in which they may reside. Any person violating this act shall he guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less than twenty nor more than fifty dollar?, provided, that Sheriffs and other officers holding i lections shall be permitted to vote in any ward or precinct in which they may hold an election: and provided, that if from any cause there should be a failure to hold an election in any civil dis trict or ward, then nothing in this uct shall be so construed as to pi event any voter fiom voting in an- other civil dis trict or ward in his county or town, for State or county olhcers at tlie tune pre scribed by law." The appointment by the President of Geo. II. Yeaman, of Kentucky, as United States Circuit Judge for this cir. cuit, has created quite a flutter in Radical circles. The Cincinnati Commercial of the 11th inst. says: "A good deal of surprise has been ex pressed regarding the appointment of Mr. Gcorce H. Yeaman to the United States Judgeship of this Circuit, and some per sons have presumed that Mr. Jesse R Grant, the President's father, must have had something to do with it. A reporter visited the old gentleman last evening, to ascertain whether he had special informa tion upon the merits of Mr. Yeaman, and was informed that Mr. Grant, sr., and Mr. Yeaman were not personally ac quainted; and the President's father seems to have shared to some extent in tne general surprise at the appointment, and expresses himself on the subject with great propriety. " It is refreshing to find Grant disap pointing the Radicals occasionally. L'uilcfiiicd Ailmculs.
