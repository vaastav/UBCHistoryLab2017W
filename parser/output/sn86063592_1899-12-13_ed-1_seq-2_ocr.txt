OFFICIAL PAPHK OF MORA COCHTY 'WEDNbiDAY EVENING, DEO 13,99 It Is said that Mason's resolution of sympathy with the Boera will re ceive the votes of a majority of the senators. If Clark, of Montana, Voueht his way into the senate he has shown himself possessed of wonJe-ful imi tative powers, says an exchange. Of all the people whom a wise na- tion should hesitate Jto "tackle" the last is a people whose soldier? put on their Sunday clothes, slug a hymn, offer up a prayer and, without life or drum or trumpet, march aiberly Into battle. And to talk about the morale of such a people being broken is to encourage false hopes of near an easy victory. Several of the largest abandoned copper mines " in eastern Maine will again be operated. The Maine copper mines were in successful operation in 1879 end showed good profits while copper was quoted at 14 cents. The mines could also" be operated on -a paying basis v. ith copper at 12 cents, but the crsh came when the Wiscon sin mines put dovfn the price of cop per to 8 cenva. Now that copper is so high, it will be very profitable to mine it. Dr. William R. Brooks, director of tho Smith Observatory, Geneva, N.

American officer was killed, is a sample of what we may expect right along from the Philippines. A few days ago the Inhabitants of a town that Mr. McKinley's agents har. put In process of "reconstruction" took ihis native officials into the etreets and cut their thro&ts. ' The president In his message mentions Negfos as "the first island to accept American sovereignity," and" he g'ves a glow ing account of. the "establishment of peace and ' order" the-e. .. Representative Payne says his new ehipping bill Is the same in all essen tial particulars as the former bill, ex cept that a provision Is made that the bounties hall not exceed $9,000,- 000 annually,- and that foreign built ships having American registry shall have only 50 per cent of the bounty rates provided. In case the total bounties ' earned exceed $9,000,000, a pro rata allowance is to be made. Very likely the bill is the same and is urged by the same gang of pillagers that were back of the other one. Only $9,000,000 a year a mere drop In the bucket and Mark' Hanna and his company reallyneed the money. In dlanapolis Sentinel.

ATTORNEY GENERAL ON TRUSTS Indianapolis Sentinel. Attorney General Griggs shows the real attitude of the administration on the trust question in his report He maintains, as the president did in hiB message, that the federal government has gone as far as it could toward tlie restraint of trusts, and that ad ditional work must be done by the states. He says: "The federal gov ernment has no. constitutional right to supervise, direct, or interfere with the transaction of ordinary business by the people of the several states unless such business relates directly, and not incidentally, to interstate commerce, and such has been the de cision of the supreme court of the United States." But Interstate com merce relates directly to insterstate commerce, and there is no reason why trust should not be prohioited from engaging in it. The existing law is a farce.. Mr. Griggs - says: "In all cases where the facts presented to the attorney; general capable pf, legal proof Jiave rstaMshed satisfactorily such an agreement or combination Foul-Smelling ! Catarrh.- Catarrh is one of the most obstinate diseases, and hence the most difficult to pet rid of. There is but one way to cur It. The disease is in the blood, and all the sprays, washes and inhaling mixture In the world can have no permanent eilect whatever upon it. Swift's 8 pe ri tic cures Catarrh permanently, for it it the only remedy which can reach the disease and force it from the blood. Mr. B. P. McAllister, of Harrodsburg, Ky., had Catarrh for years. He writes: "I could see no Improvement whatever, though 1 was constantly treated with spray ma vuua, ana ainar ent Inhaling remedies In fact. I eould feel that each winter I was worse than th year previous. "Finally II was brought to my notloe that Catarrh waaa blood disease, and after think ins over the matter. 1 aawltwasun reasonable to expect to be cured by remedies which only reached the surface. I then decided to try a" s s n,l after a few bottles were used. I no ticed a peroeptlble Improvement. Continuing tbe remedy, the disease was forced out of ml avatem. and a eomDlet cure was the result. I advise sll who have this dreadful dleease to ahandon thelrlocal treatment,whlchhasnevei done them any good, and take 8. 8. 8., a rem th&t nan reaeh tha dlaeage and cure It. To continue the wrong treatment for Catarrh is to continue to suffer. Swift's Specific is a real blood remedy, and cures obstinate, deep-seated diseases, which other remedies have no effect whatever upon. It promptly reaches Catarrh, and never fails to cure even the most aggravated cases. .S.SLBlood Is Purely Vegetable, and is the only blood remedy guaranteed to contain no dangerous minerals. ' Books mailed free by SwJft Speclfl Company Atlanta, Georgia..' In restraint of Interstate commerce as is contemplated by the Sherman act, legal proceedings have been tak en by him in the' name of the Uni ted States either to dissolve the com bination or to punish the offenders by indictment." Very probably this is true. And what does the sum total of the proceedings amount to? Not a solitary trust has been suppressed. On the contrary they have multiplied under this law with a 'rapidity un heard of In the past. And everyone of them is engaged in interstate com merce. Everyone of them is In fact restraining Interstate commerce. The form of the law merely pro'ectd them in their disobedience of Us original intent. It le a cheap humbug. But Congress can easily pass a law pre venting any trust from " engaging In Interstate commerce at all, If it so de sires., . ' LA
