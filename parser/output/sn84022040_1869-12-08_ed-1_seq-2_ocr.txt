THE ASH COOLIE KOVEKEHT. There would seem to be a very syste vatic movement upoa tbe part of ibe 'Caucasians" who were born in Ireland and Walea to keep up ao orgai ized op position to the coming hither of China men. The New York press dispatches rf tbe 4tb in it. contain tbe following tid bit : Alexander McDonald. President of the H inert' Association of Great Britain, who upon bis tour of this country observed the labor elemtnt, addressed the Workinjrmen'a Vniou last night in regard to the Chinese on the Pacific slop, lie said their further importation should be stopoed. a it was the importation of a slave element worsr in aome respects than the old negro system that brought about our war. This fellow McDonald is, doubtles, a lineal descendant of those honest Higb landers tsbo, when tbej wanted a band of Lowland cattle used to first swear thai the cattle bad bitten them ana then swoop down is tbe night and "as' sert Che rights of the laboring man " by stealing every bull, cow, steer, ox and beifer that could be stampeded into the mountains which lie beyond B-n Nevis and the Frith of Forth. We jalge thia to be tbe case because no honest Scotsman ever talked as this Sandy McDonald is reported to have expressed himself. A Sawney has too much nativejseose, too strong an appre. riatioa of logic and reason to le led, honestly, into tbe utterance of such bald and lying drmagognery as is bere scribed to "The President of tbe Miner' Association of Great Britain-" Will the Cells never be bonest ?

In an editorial art'cle in the Sacramento Union headed Meeting of tbe Legislature," tbe fol lowing toothsome paragraph occurs: Tbe Democrats have a clear majority over all of fifty-two in the House and twelve in the Senate. On tbem, then, will fall tbe responsibilities of legisn. tion. Il they evince a spirit of justice and a eapaciiy for statesmanship, they may plant tbeir power oo an enduring basis and rule the State for many years to come. If tbey display ignorance and pariiality, and give way to the as sauitsof corruption s and.tlie flatteries of a venal and huckstering partisan press, their power cannot continue be yond tbe present year. 'Can these things be and overcome us like a summer's cloud, without our special wonder?" Tun CaLiroasiA Legislators is in Session. Among some things which they will not do is to pass the Fifteenth amendment.

' The Ledger of Dee. 4th has come, and can be had at the book store of Pattison & Spencer. The Ledger says the gal (the bankers' daughter) is living nn" the Sacramento river in a dead-fall. She's disgusted with her home, and believes he has loving parents in this world. The Ledger says the old woman that keeps the chebang claims to be her mother but 6he don't believe it, and concludes to run otfto Sacramento. In going there she sought shelter in a cabin, but believing it to be the home of grizzly bears she vacates the premi ses, or in other words gets up and dusts. She had proceeded far, before a huge grizzly sprang from behind the busTies, and wiih his paw came down upon her skirts, tearing them through and through and pining her last the balance to befuund in the Ledger.
