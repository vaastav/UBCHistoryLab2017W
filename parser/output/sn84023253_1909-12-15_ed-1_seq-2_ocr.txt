THE CALEDONIAN CO. land within its borders is likely to attract wide attention. This power by the state is just what is needed at the present time. The state cannot at present purchase large quantities of land for forest preserves or reservoirs for the rainfall because it lacks money and the voters would not vote the money. But if it can regulate the cutting of timber on private lands for the purpose of protect ing public interests it has the power to act in forest preservation before the forests are gone. It is time now for all citizens to consi der seriously the best method of assum ing control over forests and be ready to take definite action next fall. The state forester is interrogated to know what course it any lie would recommend in this matter. Lumber men are closelv interested and they too should be pre pared to give the public their side of the case. J lie state must be careful to evojve some plan that will not do injust ice to the private parties if its acts are to stand. men of America today, says;- "The cry ing evil of the young man who enters the business world today is the lack of appli cation, preparation, thoroughness, with ambition but without the willingness to struggle to gain the desired end.

President Taft's Message. The message of President Taft at the opening of Congress has been accepted by many papers as a very safe and sane document without any especially strong features. There are however some state ments that must be recognized as un usual and that indicate a determination on the President's part to serve well the interests of the people. After showing that there willjbe a deficit of $73,075 620 at the end of the current fiscal year the President says :- In order to avoid a deficit for the en suing fiscal year I directed the heads of departments in the preparation of their estimates to make them as low as poss- loie consistent witn imperative govern mental necessity, I he result has been, as I am advised by the secretary of the treasury, that the estimates of the ex penses of the government for the fiscal year ending June 30. 1911 that is, for the next fiscal year are less by $55,663 000 than the total of appropriations for the current hscal year are less by $94-, 000,000 than the estimat s for that year. So far as the secretary of the treasury is able to form a judgment as to futnre income, there will be no deficit in me year ending June au, mil, Dut a small surplus of $712,000. In the war department the estimates have been cut to $45,000,000 less than for the present year and the President says :- This could be accomplished only by cutting off new projects and suspending for the period of one year all progress in military matters, tor the same reason 1 nave directed that the army shall not be recruited up to its present authorized strength. Speaking of the navy department he says :- Owing to the necessity for economy in expenditures, i nave directed the curtail ment of recommendations for naval appropriations so that they are thirty eight millions less than the correspond ing estimates of last vear, and the re quest for new naval construction is limited to two first class battleships and one repair vessel. nnoiner important statement is in regard to injunctions in which he says it lit 1 1 . i . 1 f we Dcneve tnat the rules ol proce dure in the leueral courts with respect to the issuance of the writ of injunction should be more accurately defined by statute and that no injunction or tem porary restraining order should be issued without notice, except where irreparable injury would result from delay, in which case a speedy hearing thereafter should be granted. " I recommend that in compliance with the promise thus made appropriate leg islation be adopted. Moreover, every such injunction or restraining order issued without previous notice and op portunity by the defendant to Ne heard should by force of the statute expire and be of no effect after seven days from the issuance thereof or within any time less than that period which the court may ux. uniess witnin sucn seven days or such less period the injunction or order is extended or renewed after previous nonce and opportunity to be heard. His recommendation regarding politi cal contributions is :- i urgently recommend to congress that a law be passed requiring that candidates in elections of members of the house of representatives and committees in charge of their candidacy and cam paign hie in a proper office of the United States government a statement of the contributions received and of the expend itures incurred in the campaign for such elections and that similar legislation be enacted in respect to all other elections which are constitutionally within the control oi congress. It must be admitted by all that the President has taken the strongest stand of any executive of recent years, for a careful expenditure of the government revenues, that he has put an effective quietus on any spirit of jingoism that develops with the enlargement of the army and navy and that the country is likely to experience an off year in war scares. His position on the question of injunctions is in advance of that taken by any other president and is one that would prevent any further abuse of that privilege. Publicity of political contri butions and expenses is another bold and righteotft position for the chief executive to assume and is a distinct advance in the cause of pure politics. In all of these thnigs one can see the determination of a calm man to meet without equivocation the duties that are before him without an appeal to popular cla mor but to act upon those principles which will give his accomplishments greater strength and permanency. Better Things Promised. If Franklin MacVeagh, secretary of the treasury, spoke authoritatively at the annual banquet of the Massachusetts Bankers' association in Boston last week his message will be recieved with pleasure throughout the country. He declared that the Payne tariff bill is but an incident in a tariff revision in the republican party which is definitely committed to a revision downward, that while there will be no more tariff tinkering at present the Payne bill is not final, that log rolling in connection with tariff changes is at an end and that the new tariff board will be a great, aid in future revisions with the information it will have on the subject. The end of log rolling in tariff revision would be a very important achievement, so important in fact that the country will need an actual demonstration be fore it will be convinced the change has come. If the day is near when actual conditions shall determine the changes to be made in our tariffs it will soon eliminate the tariff question very largely from politics and will afford proper protection to American industries with out permitting unreasonably high prices. The school authorities in New York city have ordered the abolishment toot ball in the public schools after Jan1 uary first, a step that indicates the waning of the popularity of brutality The Bennington Banner has just pass ed its sixth birthday. It is an example of what good business enterprise and a sane independence can accomplish in one of the small fields of Vermont journalism Wants ta Prosecute Frauds. In his annual report Attorney General Wickersham speaking of the sugar frauds says : "No effort will be spared to ascer tain the precise amount of which the gov ernment has been defrauded, to recover all moneys due, and to punish all those who may be found to have participated in any respect in the frauds, whether as officers or agents of the importers or as officials of the government. I earnestly request a special appropriation of $50,- 000 to enable this work to be effectively prosecuted." It is to be hoped that Con gress will grant his request and not at tempt any grand stand investigation on its own part. Prosecutions by the at torney general would secure convictions wherever possible while an investigation by Congress would be very likelv to re sult in the immunity of some guilty par ties who had rather tell about the other fellow's wrong doing than to take the punishment for his own offenses would cost the country more than $50, 000 too. It It is not a very flattering condition among Vermont dairymen that shows out of fifty-nine dairies examined in the interests of the Massachusetts board of health only twenty-nine were producing good enough milk to be legally sold in Massachusetts. Evidently Vermont dairymen have considerable to learn vet, Another thing to be thought of is are the people in Vermont going to take without question the products of a dairy that Massachusetts has rejected. Vermont is certainly entitled to as good milk as any other section of the country but it must assert itself if it is to have it. Vermont farmers too should not be satisfied until they produce milk that will pass the test of any market. Lyrics ot New England and Other Poems" is the title of a very attractive book which will be placed on the market before the holidays. A copy has been sent to this office with the compliments of the author, John II. Flagg of New York. Mr. Flagg is a native of Wil mington, Vt., but for thirty years past has been a well known lawyer and club man of New York City. In the winter of 1900 he met with an accident and since that time has been confined to his home.

PRESS COMMENT. State Has the Power to Control Privately Owned Forests, Much has been heard of public forest preserves, little at the tact that four hltns ol the timber standing in this country is privately owned. Not only do private interests own four times as much of the woods as the State and Federal Governments own, but these woods are the more valuable. Thev are being burned over at an average loss of tou.uuu.uuu. 1 hey are cut wastefu lv. at the rate of three and a half times their annual growth. One-fourth of the tim ber is lost in logging. In the White Mountains and on the Southern Annal, achian range the forests that regulate tne neaowaters ot enormous water powers are being stripped fioni the mountains. these immensely valuable privately owned forests are "subject to the State's control, without purchase bv the States. On April 6, 1908, Justice Holmes of the Federal Supreme Court handed down a decision sustaining the State of Maine in its contention that its police power was uucquaie to restrict tne cutting or destruction of private forest coverts in a way "to preserve or enhance the value of such lands and trees thereon, and pro tect and promote the interests of such owners and the common welfare of the people.' the principle has this broad application, injustice Holmes' opinion the State as quasi soverign and rep resentative of the interests of the public has a standing in court to protect the atmosphere, the water, and the forests within its territory, irrespective of the assent or dissent of the private owners of the land most immediately concerned." The Times advises those vast interpsts that are being ruined by the denuding of tne vvnite Mountains and the Southern Appalachians to abandon their attempt, futile after sixteen years of continued effort, to persuade Congress to buy "limited strategic areas" in these regions and to submit to Gov. Willson of Ken tucky, Chairman of the Committee of the House of Governors, a olan for uniform State laws to control them in nrivate ownership for the "common welfare of the people. Such a law, passed and enforced in every State of the Union, would conserve and increase its wealth more than any other single project of legislation. The New York Times. Vermont's State Forest. "Vermont, it is a pleasure to note, is setting resolutely about the business of conserving its remaining timber wealth, and growing more, by methods that will be determined by a trained state forester. A tract of 450 acres, near Plainfield, has been purchased and set apart for demon strating methods of cultivation and cut ting tnat will make the tract serve as an experiment station for that section of the state. Later similar work will be undertaken in other sections. Vermont has not suffered as New Hampshire has from the forest strippers, and it is freer from influences that obstruct sensible plans of conservation." Boston Herald. "Vermont's newly declared purpose to keep her mountains 'in verdure clad' is a commendable effort to continue worthy ol the name she bears." IBos -... T i l iuu iiauscript. it win be some gratification to Ver- monters to see that already their awakened interest in this great economic matter and the efforts they have thus lar put lorth to begin its adjustment are meeting with favorable comment from tneirgood neighbors. In this connection, it maybe of interest to Vermont readers that The Messenger has used the word "awakened" unadvis- mitting the evaporation to be the same from the other leaves of the tree as it was from those on which the experiment was made, the quantity of water thrown off from this tree in 'the space of 12 hours would be three hundred and thirty n ne thousand and seventy-two grains. Upon examining the number and dimen sions of the trees which covered the ground where I made the experiment, 1 tninu it would be a moderate computa tion to estimate them as equal both in magnitude and extent on every square rod to four such trees as that which I had examined. This will give 640 such trees for the quantity of wood contained on one acre. This estimation is less than the quantity of wood which is generally found upon one acre of land in this part of America. The weight of one pint of water is one pound avoirdupois, or seven thousand grains Troy weight, and eight such pints make one gallon. Making the calculation upon these principles, it will be found that from one acre of land thus covered with trees, three thousand eight hundred and seventy-five gallons of water are thrown off and dispersed in the atmosphere in the space of twelve hours." Perhaps modern investigators would have a different way of making such a test and might vary somewhat in the figures set down from it, but Doctor Williams made an easy demonstration of the tremendous volume of moisture that is taken up and stored bv the trees on the hillsides onlv to find its wav down again to feed the springs and brooks and ponds that in their turn husband the watto- supply of the villages oeiow. at.
