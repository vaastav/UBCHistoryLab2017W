DISCHARGED VOLUNTEERS Government Should Nut Holil Sol der Since I'cncc- linn lleen De clared Senator Cockrcll'i VlevvH Soldiers in tlie Ilnud- lrollon for Sloro Xleicnnlrn The Bill 1'CfcBCd. The discussion in the Senate yesterday, pursuant to the passapro of the urgent de llclcncy bill. In regard to the discharge of. the volunteer soldiers and the reoiganiza- ' tion of tlio regular army, was the first public indication of lh opposition which will be made to the Administration's plans In resard to the latter measure, and it be came evident to senators who favor the reorganization of the regular army on tho basis of 100,000 men that if their plans succeeded it would bo only after a de termined effort on their part. I Senator Cockrell opened the direussion in a lengthy speech, setting forth reasons why the volunteer soldiers should be im mediately discharged. He maintained that it was an act of bad faith on the part of the Government to hold these soldiers, who had enlisted to fight the Spaniards, after peace was declared, and said that when the treaty was ratilied there could bo no possible excuse for holding them longer. Senator Hale replied to Senator Cock rell's remarks brielly. saying that he sjm palbJzed with tho views of the senator, and added that in his opinion it would be a wise tiling for "the Administration to muster out the volunteer army in a very few months. He stated that there were at present 10,030 troops In Cuba, C.( In Porto Ilico and about Il.W) in the Pli lippin's. Tlie evacuation board In Cuba, he said, had recommended that it would be nec essary to send 50,CC5 troop3 to that is'and as soon as the Spanish troops had de parted. ' Senator Chandler wanted to know, in view of the fact that their enlistment had been for tho period of tlie war, if it was not Incumbent on the President to discharge the volunteer troops as soon as he could Senator Hale replied that, he looked at it in that way. Senator Chandler then added that there was then no use In this discussion. "The thing to do," he continued, "is to s-eek the easiest way, which Is very near at hand, and certainly 1 am glad that the committee had sufficient confidence in the President as not to interfere with his duty In this respect." Senator Gorman took Issue with Senator Chandler in Ills position In the matter and said that in view of tho declaration In the President's last message in which he'.stated that he should take no steps to muster out the volunteer army until some rovl.-lon had been made for the enlarge ment of the regular army, he believed it was the duty of Congress to place some provision in the present bill to make n. reduction In the ranks of the volunteer army of 25,000 men within the next three months and S.0CO more before the lirst of July nest. "I believe that Congress should exercise an Independent Judgment from the Ad ministration, when It comes to the cm plojmcnt of large military forces," he declared earnestly. "That the Anglo Saxon will permit himself here or wher ever he may be, to stand still and mark time, not hating an objective point for advancement, and all that goes to make up a nation, including its commerce, I lonot believe. We must have coaling stations and outposts to supplv not only our navy, but our great commerce that will Increase and grow as the ears go by. "We must have all of the facilities that are necessary to enable Americans to take their share of the world's com merce. Senator Gorman said that whatever coaling stations and territory It was nec essary for us to hold temporarily, for he Open every evening;

He saw no way tindfr our system of government to provide UiaT troops 'could be recruited "from a people jri? were not citizens of the United ctuies. Senator Allison took the floor in behaU of the bill as it came from the committee and spoke In part as follows: Tills deficiency bill which is now under consideration is a bill exclusively relating to tho army and navy, making appropria tions for Its support for the remainder of tho fiscal year. Last year wlien tho ap propriation bills for the army and navy were provided" for, and moro especially tho army. Congress deemed it wlso to limit that appropriation to the first Six months of the fiscal jear and appropriated a sufficient sum to maintain the army then called for by tho President in view of our relations with Spain. "At that time Congress was willing to trust tho President as to the number ot men required to meet the necessity thcr existing, and also as io the necessary ex penditures to carry on the naval opera tions on tho oceans. Tho war. or active operations, ended sooner than those who liad charge of these bills anticipated, and the result Is that, though wo nominally appropriate here over J60.000.000 for the army and navy, it is In reality only a re appropriation of the sum which was ap propriated for tho first six: months of the year. Our military and naval successes have enabled us to muster out 110,000 of the men who were mustered into the serv ice during tho year, and for which -wc would have had to provide. "I svmpathize with what tho senator from iiiFOuri (Mr. Cockrell) and other senators have said respecting the general desire that at the earliest practicable mo ment tho volunteer forces, or such ior tion of them as can be spared, shall be mustered out. Senator Allison called attention to the fact that if the army was at on:e placed back on its former peace basis the tegu lar army would bo reduced to 27.C0J men, 13,000 of which he said would be required to man our defense works In this coun try. Ho cited the conditions In Cuba, saying the island had been In a state of war for a long time, and that to carry out our avowed purpose of establishing a rerma nent form of government there it would be necessary to havo-a cons derab'c fo cu garrisoned on the island, referring to the estimate of Generals llutler and Wade and Admiral Sampson that 10 U0 men would be needed there, but that this number might liossibly be reduced ti 10, 000 at a reasonably early date. He summed up his remarks by ssying that this matter of the reorganization of the army was a question properly for the military committee, rind that the present bill should bo allowed to pas without Money wanted to know it means could not bo provided In -the b 11 to permit recruiting to the runks of the volunteer army so that men who had families depending upon them and who wanted to quit tho army might be a"ovv ed to go and their places supplied. Sen ator Hale replied that the Committee en Military Affairs was at the present time considering such a proposition. Senator Sewall. speaking, he said, rs .i military man and one who was posted on such matters, declared that tO.CO) men would be muttered out of the volunteer army before next July without any legis lation in regard to the matter. Tho bill was then put on its final pas sage and ngreed to v.-ithout opposition. On motion of Senator Hale the Eeaa'.c adjourned over until Monday. Tlie Army Hill. Gens.

A SUBSTITUTE OFFERED Hoard of Trade Petition Senator Morgan Oatcenerals III Oppo nent Scorer Thane Who Antag onize the Canal Senntor Allen's Attack on the mil Scheme ot Senator Cnfferj-. The MorRan Nicaragua. Canal bill was temporarily laid aside by the Senate yes terday to allow tho consideration of tho urgent deficiency bill. Notwithstanding this, however, the canal discussion cropped out at several places during the day's proceedings, and a substitute bill was offered by Senator Cattery, Senator Morgan, in presenting the peti tion of the National Hoard ot Trade, now In session in this city,, relative to the construction of the canal, urging speedy legislation, and commending tho pending measure, requested that it be read by the clerk and bo Inserted in the Itecord. Senator Allen made objection to this, whereupon tho Alabama senator recalled tho petition from tho clerk's desk and read It himself, thus incorporating it as a part of his remarks and securing its publication in the Itecord. This action aroused the Ire of Senator Teller, who made tho point that Senator Morgan's remarks were all out of order, and, under the rules, they should not be printed. Senator Morgan replied, scoring the opposition to canal legislation by sen. ators who, he raid, claimed to be friendly to the project, yet opposed with all their vigor eery measure looking to its ac complishment. Ho incidentally remarked that he would accept and support any measure that would build the canal; that he would urge the adoption of the pending one un less :i better were offered, and, more than tills, he would do everything in his power to let tho country know what com mercial men of tlie country thought on the matter. The resolutions which he had offered, he said, represented the sentiments of forty-nine commercial bodies throughout tho country, and were entitled to much weight. Senator Teller retorted that when he could reply to tiie senator without break ing the rules of the Snate ho should take occasion to do so. Senator AKerr. however, made a further atttrck on the bill, charging that It was In the interest of a private corporation, and faying that he should speak further on tho matter later. Senator Morgan's remarks were allowed to Maud without further question. The bill introduced by Senator Cattery as a substitute was ordered printed. Al the time it was introduced Senator Caf fery failed to get It read, and when he called it up later for that purpose he was Informed thit It had been sent to the public printer. Tho bill provides that tho Tresldcnt shall enter into negotiations with Great Britain for the abrogation or modification of tho Clayton-Duluer treaty so as to en able tho United States to construct, own, maintain and operate a canal across the Isthmus of Darien. under its exclusive Jurisdiction. Tho President is also au thorized to purchase all valid outstanding grants and concessions for the construc tion of such canal for a sum net to ex ceed 13.009,000. lie is also to purchase from the gov ernments of Nicaragua and Costa Illca a sufiicient acreage of land with privi leges and casements top. the. construction ot the canal, after wlilch thi Secretary of War is to proceed wltfr theconstrue tlon of the canal as kv Itl- other public works, One hundred and forty million" dollars Is placed as the limit of cost, $a1000,CX of which is to be immediately available for the purchase of the out standing concessions, including the stipu lated purchase of right of way from Nicaragua and Costa Rica. Senator Harris presented a resolution of Inquiry which was agreed to by the Senate, calling on the President to trans mit to the Senate all information nvnll ablo in regard to the work of the Nicar agua Canal Commission, and the time the full report of Admiral Walker would be in.

He was also on the Cleveland electoral ticket in USi, nnd was a delegate to the St. Louis con vention in 1SS3, where he was selected to represent Ohio on the National Democrat ic Committee. His business capacity and thoicugh grasp of the details of anything v, lth which he connected himself caused him to be made chairman of the cam paign committee In the ensuing national campaign. At the death of William H. Harnum, in 1SS3, Mr. Brice was made chairman of the national committee, and made a. vigorous but unsuccessful fight for the te-electlon of Mr. Cleveland. He spent much of his time for the advance ment of his party's interest, and it is well known that he spent considerable of his private means in the effort to secure the success of tho ticket-he was championing. In January. ISM, Mr. Brice was elected by tho legislature of Ohio as a United Slates senator to succeed tho Hon. Henry B. Payne. In tho Senate Mr. Brice was not compelled to servo "tho probationary period that usually falls to the lot of young members He forged at once to the front and be came nnd active and Important Ihjuro lr tho councils of his party. On such public questions as Involved river and hike navi gation, the seacoast trade, fortifications, river and liarbor improvement", and es pecially the troublesome questions grow ing out of the railroad system and trans portation problems, his advice was eager ly sought by statesmen of both parties. A close, student of economic subjects, Mr. Brice was able to devote much time v!tl profit to his party to the tariff question nnd tt was largely through Tiis work that the party was able, so far as the Senate was concerned, to agree upon a bill that consolidated the party ote to that body and mado It possible for the bill to be- como a taw nnd tariff reform to be an as. sured fact.

He was not gifted with rhetorical speech, but h'5 short, pithy, five-minute speeches had condensed wlthlr them the essence of the subject upon which ho spoke and droc a point home to his hearers In a. way that impressed Itself upon the understanding. He was a hard-working man and reflected credit upon the State which honored him with a scat in tlie Senate of the United States. Mr. Brice was n membjr of the Manhat tan, Lawyers', D. K. V.
