Site Dfliwwat Washington Letter. From oar re-rulnr Oorrespondan. Washington, Nov. 30th, 1806. Mr Bryan has promised to attend the conference of silver men which is to be held in Washington a few days after congress meets and which will try to de ter mine the attitude of the silver men in congress not only towards legislation that ia strictly financial in its nature, bat also towards revenue legislation, which is indirectly financial. The re sult of that conference will come very near to deciding whether there will be any revenue legislation at this session, assuming that the republicans really de- eire that there shall be any, which is by no means certain. The silver senators are in a majority, and if they act to gether can dictate the legislation eo far as the senate is concerned, but there is a doubt aa to whether the republican silver senators will agree to act with the silver democrats on revenue legislation and at least one populiBt senator is also in doubt. These doubts are expected to be cleared up at the conference. The luxury loving senators will have no cause for complaint when they meet in the newly done np senate chamber Everything looks spick and span new and most of what ia in sight is. There are new mahogany desks for the eolons and richly upholstered leather covered chair, all of one pattern, instead of each being tbe selection of the senator who occupies it. The old wood benches have been removed from the galleries and folding opera chairs put in their place, while everything is of a color harmonizing with the mahogany on the main floor and, as a wag baa suggested with the noses of several of the senatoia There is also new ventilating machin ery aad a fine electric lighting outfit. The house shares in the last named im provement, but in none of the others. The house, which is willing to follow the senate in appropriating money for lux- nrious fittings for its chamber hasn't yet been elected. The average member o1 the house ia just a little bit afraid of the effect of such fixings upon his constitu enta. , Everybody who knows Hod John Sherman knowe that an iceberg isn't in the same class with him when he is dis posed to lower the temperature aroun his immediate presence. Therefore it is believed in Washington that if Mark Hanna carries out his reported inten tion of offering Mr Sherman a seat in AlcKinley's cabinet if he will agree to join in tne deal to make Hanna his suc cessor in the senate, he will meet the coldest wave of his life. It has been understood for soma time by those who are near to Mr Sherman politically that the old man not only wants to stay in the senate to the end of bis present term, but alio to be re-elected to another, . and that he has already began to pull wires to bricg about his desires. If Mr ' Hanna tries to blcff him by telling him that he and Gov Bushnell and Foraker will ee to it that he shall be defeated if he refuses to fall in with their plans and g-oee before the legislature for re-election two years hence, he may find that Mr Sherman is eomewbat of a bluffer him eelf. He has already made one by de nying any knowledge of Ha ana's inten tion. 6 There will be a circus among the re publicans when Mark Hanna comes to Washington to appoint the chairman of the McKinley Inauguration Committee, especially if he carries out the origina plan of appointing Mr S W Woodward, a gold democrat who was a heavy contrib utor to the campaign fund, aa he proba bly will. The rank and file of the local republicans are opposed to the chair manship being given to Woodward or to anybody else who is not a republican and some of those who are not appli cants for official favors will do some plain talking to Eanna if he sticks to Woodward. One of the cheekiest highwaymen plays ev.jr perpertrated in these parts was worked off on lower Pacific avenue last Friday night says the Tacoma West Coast Trade. Two men with faces part ly covered with handkerchiefs entered the office of John B. Stevens' wholesale feed house at No 1020, abont six o'clock and after compelling George Stevens.tbe only occupant at that time, to open tbe safe, which was happily depleted of cash, relieved him of his watch and marched him, with hands pointed skyward, out o the office aid down tbe sidewalx 150 feet to tbe feed store of P. J. Fransioli & Co. Here they entered and hold up o if. Bocks well aod Thomas Fransioli, compelling tbe former to open the safe, and departed after rounding up eucb coin as could be secured Their pecun iary gain amounted to about $10 and a gold watch, hardly compensatory for the daring enterprise displayed. A street car and several pedeatraiise passed dur ing the performance, which consumed about ten minutes. The following is taken from tbeOmaLa, Neb., World Herald: Many farmers abont W meide as well as a number of business men are burning corn in order to keep warm, in preference to eoal. Tbe principal reason for this if, of coarse. that It is va-tly cheaper, for it takes only J 22 2-3 bushels of corn to make a ton. there is also another feature to this which is actually astonishing when it is figured out. Ten do.iars will buy 91 bushels of 11 cent corn. This, at 75 pounds to the bushel, makes 6,825 pounds, which is equivalent to about tbe same amount of coal. The freight on this coal At 22 cents per 100 wou'd be ' $14 32, so trie railroad company loses that to Deitin with by this substitution of corn for coa'. .-'They also loe the freight on the corn they do not haul to Chicago, so in $10 worth of corn or 01 bushols at 12 cents freight per,., bushel, thvy ioe $1091. Thus we reach the re- u-aritaoie com-mqion mat every time a resident. of .Wayne county bora. $10 wortii of era lor fuel be save $10 and deprives the railroad company of $25,24 worth of business.

Mr. Bryan's Book. A dispatch from Lincoln, Nebraska says that a representative of the Asso ciated Frees learned the title nf Mr Bryan's book is to be "The First Battle." In the preface he states his reasons for writing the work in the following words: Ihe campa'gn of 1896 was a remarkable one, whether we measure it by the mag nitude of the issue Involved or by the depth of interest aroused. I have been lead to undertake the present woik by a desire felt by myself and expressed by others to have the more important events of the campaign put in permanent form for the convenience of the peopU who have taken part in the contest, and for the use of those who shall hereafter de sire to review the struggle. The amount of work done by the advocates of free coinage is beyond computation, and the number of those who took active part in the contest is too great for enumeration. These facts, together with the difficulty in choosing between so many meritori ous speeches, haye compelled me to limi the quotations to the addresses mad and papers issued by persons standing in an official or semi-official capacity ,and to the principal speeches delivered by myself. I have added a brief history of the campaign, including a discussion oj the election returns and the significance thereof. . It has also been thought best to narrate the part taken by n.e in the eilver agitation prior to the convention, and at the request of the publishers I have included a biographical sketch written by Mrs Bryan." It is under stood that the publishers, W. B. Conkey St Co., of Chicago, will issue the book in the early part of January. A certain peasant and his wife, in Germany, went married on the same day as the emperor and empress, the peas ant's Christian name being William Their first child, a bov, was born on the same day as the erowu prince, after which they bad five other sons, each of wham was born at the same time aa the five younger boys of the emperor. The royal couple were informed of this and were exceedingly interested in she very strange coincidence, but this interest was intensified when, on the last occa sion of aToyal birth via: The tittle daefghterof the kaiser it was learned that the peasant's wife in question bad also given birth to a daughter on the same day. So astonished were the em peror and empress that they a'ood as godfather and godmother to tbia little giri and have well provided for her fu ture. Philadelphia Ledger. A dispatch says that Mrs Helen l)ick- erson Harford, of Uregon, national organ izer of the W. C. T. U- created a eenea tion Sunday while filling the pulpit of the Dundee M E church in Kansas City, by denouncing, in unmeasured terms, the acceptance by the city of a memorial to be erected in the center ot the city to the memory of Ferd Heitn, the brewer, lately deceased. The Ileim brothers, who eucceeled their father in business, had drawn plans for an imposing atiuct are, to be erected to tbe deceased's mem ory, and subsequently tendered it to tbe city officials. In the coarse of her ser mon, Mrs Harford arraigned the city fathers for their action, alin Jed to the memorial as a "monuine&t of infamy and appealed to her congregation to pre vent its erection. Mrs Harford has a daughter who is resident of Albany. Gen. W. H.L. Barnes, who was within ten feet of the ricg,ea;s Fitzsimmons Lii Sharkey a foul blow as alleged, be is pos itive of it.

It would seem that if Spain should of fer to Cuba genuine autonomy a meas ure of home rule, which, while preserv ing the sovereignty of Spain, would sat isfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects there should be no just reason why the pacification of the bland might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true interest ot all concerned. It would step at once the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless fcr whichever party mv ultimately prevail It would keep intact the possessions ot Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather th.n impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the property of the island and the fortunes of its inhabitants within their own con trol, without severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-gov-ernmeut under the most favorable con1 ditions. It has beenobiected on tbe one side that Spain would not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms , on tbe other side, that prom- j ised autonomy, however liberal, is in sufficient, because without assurance o the promise being fulfilled. But tbe reasonableness of the requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender on tbe part -t the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is conceded, is not altogether apparent. It Ignores important features of tbe situation: The stability two years' duration bas given to the insur. rectionjthe feasibility of its indefinite prolongation ia the nature of things as shown by past experience ; the utter and imminent ruin of tbe island unless the present strife is speedily composed, and. above all, the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all branches ot her government, and all her leading public men concede to exist and profess a de sire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to with hold tbe proffer of needed reforms until tee parties demanding them pot them' selves at the mercy of Spain by throwing down their arms, bas the appearance of neglecting tbe gravest ot the perils and inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willioj-nesa to grant re forms. The objection on behalf of the insurgents that the promised reforms cannot be relied npoo must, of course, be considered, though we have bo right to assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes) to do for tbe relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the let ter of tbe undertaking. Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions on the part of the weaker ot tbe two combatants are always natural and not aiways unjustifiable, being sincerely de sirous in the interest of both as well as on our own account that tbe Cuban problem should be solved with tbe least possible delay, it was intimated by this government to tbe government of Spain some months ago that it a satisfactory measoreof borne role were tendered the Cuban insurgents, and would be ac cepted by them upon a guaranty of it execution , Ibe United Slates would en deavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of lurnisbing such guaranty. While no definite response to this inti mation has yet been received from tbe Spanish government, it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as al ready suggested, no reason la perceived why it should not be approved by tbe in surgents. Neitner party caa fail to ere the importance of early action, and both must realize that to prolong tbe p-weeni stale of things for even a short period will add erormously to tbe time and la bor and expenditure necessary to bricg about the industrial recuperation of tbe island. I: is, therefore, fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain , aod tbe insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once inaogu. a ted and pushed to an immediate suc cessful issue. The friendly offices of li e United Slates, either in the manner above outlined or in any other way con sietent with our constitution and laws, will always be at tbe disposal of either party. Whatever policy may arise, our policy and our interest would constrain us to object to tbe acquisition of the island or to any inteiference with its control by aoy other power.

T has been held that coo. sumption is hereditary, and the fact that one per son of a family bad died with consump tion was considered a sure sign that others of that family could not escape it. This ia partly true and partly untrue. A mmm aw.fl. l lungs Is likely to transmit that weakness to bis children. But there is no reason in the world why the weakness should be allowed to develop. There ia no reason why the lunri should remain weak. Weak lun-rs predispose a child to consumption. They provide a place for germs to settle. That Is all that ia necessary. Once let the germs of disease gain a foot-hold, and they in. crease with a deadlr rapidity. Pretty soon the blood Is full of them, and so loses iu healUifulness and iu strength-giving quali ties. If the weakness ia in some other or-raa, tbe disease will show Itself in that organ. The germs will get into the blood, lust the same, and the body will begin to lose strength. W speak particularly of consumption because it is most common because it causes more than one-sixth of ui aeaus in tne world. If there Is a weak and crumbly spot in Vie foundation of a house, the owner clears ut the decaying material, supplants it with new, strong stuff. That's all there is to do. That' u that's necessary. That is exactly the thing to do with the luntrs. Keep them full of rich, red, whole some blood, and tbe weaknesa will disap pear. Decaying tissues will be thrown ofl", snd new material will be added until the longs are well and perfectly strong again. This is tbe thing that Dr. Pierce's Goldeo Medical Discovery does. This is wbst makes it cure 08 per cent of all casea of consumption where it is taken according to directions. It searches out disease germs wherever they may be in the body.
