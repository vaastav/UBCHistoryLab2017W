GREAT FALLS DAILY TRIBUNE IV. M. Bole, Editor O. S. Warden, Manager Leonard G. Diehl, Business Manager EDITORIAL PAGE THE REVISION OF TAXES. pHAIRMAN FORDNEY, head of ^ the committee on ways and means in the present house of rep resentatives, is quoted as saying at a meeting of the committee to dis cuss the next revenue bill that he doubts whether the sum of four bil lion dollars, estimated as necessary by the secretary of the treasury in order to carry out his program of caring for the needs of the govern ment and paying off public debt as it becomes due is a high enough esti mate. Mr. Fordney thinks it is too low. The expenditure of any greater sum of money would mean increased taxation instead of lower taxation and Mr. Fordney admits that to in crease taxes is not to be considered. He proposes as a substitute policy ^iot paying the public debt as it be comes due, but raising just sufficient to meet the interest and sinking funds of the public debt plus the or dinary expenses of the government, and refunding the victory note bonds and the savings stamps as they be come due by the issue of new bonds. In this way taxation by the federal government could be reduced in the comitig years, though at the expense of increasing our interest charges. It is very much the same policy and logic that the head of a family might use who found his income somewhat short of his expenses, if he deter mined to issue notes for his grocery bills and other monetary obligations as such obligations became due, so as cut down the drain on his cash in come. As a temporary expedient no doubt it would bring relief to the family finances, but in the end such policy would bring disaster. The individual who sought to follow such a method of financing his family ex pense would first have to assure him self that the notes he issued to meet his maturing bills would be accept able to the people he owed. Carrying out the comparison it will be up to Chairman Fordney to be sure that he can float some *$7,500,000,000 of new government bonds, for that is the sum coming due in the next few years which he proposes to refund with new bond sales . Of course there is no doubt that Uncle Sam can find purchasers for that amount of bonds, or for a much greater amount of bonds, if he is willing to make the interest high enough. The obligations which are falling due bear interest at the rate cf between four and four and three cuarters per cent. The new bonds would have to bear a good deal high er rate than that to sell at par on the present state of the money mar ket. Perhaps they would have to return to the investor about six per cent in order to find a ready market at this time, unless they were made tax free bonds. Tax free bonds are very objectionable from many stand points. For one thing they draw money from productive enterprises. There is a,constant tendency under present high rates of federal taxation for capital to withdraw from produc tive enterprises, and seek safe refuge in non-taxable securities, where the owner can count on a steady income without risk from growing levies on it from new legis lation or increasing government ex travagance. We are of the opinion that the pol icies of Secretary Houston are more sound, and we had better meet our obligations by paying them off when they fall due instead of postponing the evil day by refunding at an in creased interest charge, even if it makes us hard up as a government and a nation to do that. Congress is much more likely to be economical in spending the taxpayers money when there is a shortage in the cash in the treasury than it is likely to be when current bills that are due and payable have been postponed for a term of years through refunding operations. When Gen. Grant was president of the republic there was much discussion as to the wisest and best method for the country to get back on a gold basis and resume specie payments. Many notable fi nanciers differed about this question, and Gen. Grant gained considerable distinction, and some ridicule, by giv ing his views on the subject rather simply. He said that the way to re sume specie payments was to re sume specie payments, and he pro ceeded to do so by official proclama tion that the greenbacks of that day would be redeemed on presentation at any subtreasury in the United States in gold coin. And behold the trick was done. No one presented any of them for redemption. The question of how to pay our debts is not quite the same problem, but we apprehend that Gen. Grant's solution would also apply here. The best way to pay our maturing finan cial obligations is to pay them, how ever short it may leave us for house keeping expenses. It is better -that we should continue to pay heavy taxes needed to meet these obliga tions than to create an artificial and false plenitude of funds by borrow ing more millions at a higher price to pay off these debts with. Paying borrowed money is never a pleasant task, but borrowing more money at higher interest rates to pay off old debts is bad finance for the individu al or for the nation. If Uncle Sam meets his obligations as they fall due, even at some present inconven ience and sacrifice it will increase his credit at home and abroad. The best way to meet a debt that is due is to pay it. We also note with interest that when the question of the present ex cess profits tax was discussed the committee was practically unani mous in favor of its repeal. That is in no way surprising. The tax was never justifiable except as an ex treme war measure. It brought in its train a great many evils. But besides all this it has been producing less and less revenue, and will soon dry up altogether as a revenue pro ducer if it is continued. Some other method of taxation will doubtless be devised to take its place, and no method that can be devised for that purpose can work any more disas trously than the excess profits tax has worked for the business interests of the country. THE 

PRECIOUS DAYS. T TNDER the heading, "What the ^ Precious Days Are Saying," the New York World grows sarcas tic toward President-Elect Harding and his party. The president-elect, in his farewell address to the senate, urged that body to forget partisan ship and not let "the precious days" pass doing nothing worth while. He wanted them to tackle legislation long needed by the country. The New York newspaper says: "Although Mr. Hardin's heart still drips love and affectaion for his col leagues in congress, and the senate in particular, he is already shifting his point of view. He has lost none of his admiration for 'the patriotic sense of responsibility which abides here,' as he said in his farewell speech to the senate yesterday, but— " 'Three months of the present ad ministration remain, and I would have house and senate join in mak ing them fruitful rather than wast ed months. There is so much to be done and we have already had so much of delay that I should like unanimous recognition that there are no party ends to serve, but precious days are calling for service to our common country.' "That is not the way Mr. Harding was talking two years ago. That is not the way Henry Cabot Lodge was talking. That is not the way the Republican senators in general were talking. Hostilities were over and the president was on his way to Europe to assist in making peace, but although they recognized the armistice with the Germans, they recognized no armistice with the president. Accordingly they began to bedevil the government of the United States. In spite of Mr. Hard ing's eloquent appeal, there is every reason to believe that they will keep on bedeviling the government of the United States. The delay of which Mr. Harding complains is Republican delay. During the short session of the Sixty-fifth congress, even the ap propriation bills were not passed, be cause a filibuster by Republican sen ators prevented action. After the Sixty-fifth congress was convened in special session, May 19, 1919, by President Wilson, nothing in the way of reconstruction legislation was en acted, because Republican senators were engaged in a filibuster against the treaty of peace. Even the rail roads were not returned to private ownership until the president threat ened to return them whether con gress acted or not. 'The precious days' that are calling for service have been calling for service ever since the first Monday in December, 1918, and the needs of 'our common country' were just as apparent dur ing the long period of Republican obstruction, in which Mr. Harding participated, as they are now. The senate, under the leadership of Mr. Lodge, refused to ratify the treaty of peace that all the other belliger ents ratified. It refused to agree on any compromise reservations. It adopted a policy of rule or ruin and has clung tenaciously to that policy ever since. That is the kind of 'pa triotic sense of responsibility' it has displayed. Now that he personally is facing the responsibility of the pres idency, Mr. Harding is able to per ceive the consequences of this pol icy of delay and obstruction for party ends. He is incontestably right in the appeal that he has made to the house and the senate; but if anything is to be accomplished, peace must first be established—not a counterfeit peace by resolution of congress, but a peace that will stand the test of international law. Here again Mr. Harding's party is the ob stacle. If the words of Mr. Harding's farewell address mean what they ought to mean, they must be con strued as an invitation to President Wilson to resubmit the treaty of Versailles to the senate. Should Mr. Wilson do this, will Mr. Harding use his influence to get the treaty ratified at once, with such compro mise reservations as two-thirds of the senators may agree to, or will 'the precious days' suddenly cease to call for 'service to our common coun try' when it is a matter of the most immediate and pressing service? Precisely what is it that 'the precious days' are saying?" B EST 

EDITORIALS OF THE DAY (Selected for The Tribune.) THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE .. Iu the last annual report to Congress upon the state of the Union which it will be his duty and his privilege to sub mit to Congress, President A\ ilson make:! no express mention of that subject which, more fully than any other, has occupied the minds of the people of the Union during the last two years. It was unnecessary, it would be futile, for Mr. Wilson to make any recommenda tion to this Congress in respect to that great aspiration of the world toward as sured peace with which through all time his name will be associated. So far as the Sixty-sixth Congress is concerned, final action was taken in respect to the League of Nations when it rejected the Treaty of Peace om March 19 last. Whatever is to be done, or attempted, to give the United States a place among the other nations of the world which have leagued themselves together to estab lish and uphold the reign of justice and of law, and to prevent war, must neces sarily be left to the next Administration and to the Senate of the next Comgress. President Wilson has done his work faithfully, he has done all that a man loving peace and that a President earn >stly striving to assure peace could do. \'o other man has done so much. In the history of the transition which brought the League of Nations into being, includ ng in its membership practically all the nations of the world save the United states and a few others not yet prepared or worthy to be admitted. Mr. Wilson will stand forth, not as the dominant figure, for no man dominated those grave councils, but as the most influential among all the statesmen who joined in the great endeavor. With full trust he may submit his part in the work to the judgment of time and an impartial world. The message is brief beyond the wont of Presidents in recent years, and that is a commendable quality, for. now that reports of the heads of departments have come to be so voluminous, it, is not necessary that the President should encumber his' annual communication to Congress with repetitions of the vast imount of information they give upon the state of the Union. Mr. Wilson, nevertheless, invites Congress to con sider matters of public business suffici ent to occupy its time during the three months of the short session. There is "necessity for an immediate considera tion of the revision of our tax laws he says. The country will agree with that. No subject to come before Con gress can be so urgent, or as to which the people of the United States are so solicitous, now that "immediate consid eration" which he recommends. The present Income Tax law is bad, it is very bad, it is unjust, harmful and oppres sive. It is an increasing menace to the industries, and the prosperity of the country, and the party responsible for providing a better system of taxation could commit no greater blunder than to postpone unnecessarily the application of the required remedy. The adoption of a budget system again has the President's approval. The bill which he vetoed because of a constitu tional defect has been amended by the House of Representatives; there is no occasion for delay in its enactment. Congress should give prompt attention too, to tbe President's recommendations in behalf of effective aid to the disabled soldiers and sailors. It is in that way, rather than by the indiscriminate dis tribution of bonus money, that the country's gratitude to the defenders of civilization can be manifested. How Congress will receive Mr. Wilson's sug gestion that a loan be made to the hard pressed Armenians cannot be foretold, but it is certain that the country would approve that act of humanity. He closes his message with a renewed expression of his faith in the future. Coming from the man who has toiled and suffered so much in their interest, this is an ex hortation of courage which the people of the country may well take to heart. New York Times, (Ind. Dem.) It is sound American business and it is good international politics to set our own house in order and keep it in order as he urges, so that while we thus grow better and stronger, the rest of the world may profit by emulation of our welfare and happiness. The preserva tion of American power, the salvation of American institutions, depend upon our making and enforcing laws which as Mr. Wilson says, "secure its full right to labor and yet at the same time safe guard the integrity of property^and par ticularly of that property which is de voted to the development of industry and the increase of the necessary wealth of the world." And the day of redemp tion for those powers and peoples of Europe now struggling against anarchy and chaos can come only out of the practice of those same principles, fun damental everywhere on the face of the earth. Nobody could more simply and clearly state both the advantage and the neces sity of our Government managing its business as carefully, efficiently and suc cessfully as private undertakings are managed than Mr. AA'ilson states them in his remark on a budget system and above all a working out revenue and ex penditures under that system so that there shall be neither undue strain upon our income nor unreasonable taxation. It is an imperative need that we should now put our Government on a business basis and Mr Wilson says that for us thus to "prove the indestructible recu perative force of a great Government of the people" will be an inspiration and guide for others. This is a good message to Congress nnd the American people whom Con gress represents. It is a good word to the world, watching this nation as the old Administration passes and the new approaches.—New York Ilearld, (Ind.) It is a comfort to note tbdt Presi The Has kin Letter * THE 

BLUE LAW DEBATE. 'IVashington, Dec. 13.—Resolved: That human nature can be improved and even made perfect by removing from it every imaginable temptation, such as drink, gambling, smoking, dancing, short skirts, Sunday baseball, and moving pictures of thrilling love scenes. This subject for debate has been hurl ed into the arena by the announcement that various religious and reform organ izations intend to have the observance of the Sabbath made compulsory in the United States. Some propose to do this by federal law, and some by city and state law. At the same time there is more or less talk of legislation against cigarettes, and gambling. In a word, ic is evident that the forces of moral re form plan to follow up the prohibition amendment with a campaign for a vari ety of other legislation designed to im prove our morals by force rather than suasion. At the same time, a howl of protest has gone up against the proposed Sab bath law aud all the other moral legis lation. It is made very plain that there is a powerful and aggressive negative to the above proposition, as well as a powerful and organized affirmative. The reformers of course, say that the nega tive is backed by promoters of amuse ments, dealers in tobacco, and other in terested parties, just as the opponents of reform say that the reformers are all in the pay of a few narrow-minded millionaires who are ambitious to make us feel their power by regulating our personal conduct. As a matter of fact there are sincere persons enough on both sides. You have only to talk to a few of the reformers to realize that most of them are burning With sincerity, that they firmly believe the world can be improved, if we can only get laws enough and policemen enough to enforce them. The Libertarians. Nor do you have to go far to find a man who has not a cent invested in any amusement proposition whatever and never expects to have, but who al most foams at the mouth as he tells you that in this alleged land of the free there will soon be somewhat less personal lib erty than there was in Russia of the Czar, unless these reformers can in some way be prevented from executing their benighted designs. Yes, there is a genuine and even heat ed difference of opinion. And it is one which has existed in this country for a long time. The reformers undoubted ly take their intellectual if not their physical descent from the Colonial Puri tans of New England, the inventors of the blue law, who put men in stocks for drinking, smoking, kissing and the like. In fact, what the reformers really aim at is nothing less than a revival of the blue laws on a national scale. The opposing school of thought is descended from Colonial Virginia and es pecially from such men as Patrick Henry and George Washington. According to the theorj of this school, personal lib erty is a necessary condition of hapjV- ness and of development. Personality cannot be developed without it. and per sonality is the essence of civilization. Morality is dependent upon character, and must therefore be inculcated by edu cation and example, not by force. It holds, therefore, that morals are not a proper sphere for legislation, and that moral restraint should be applied only to those who are irresponsible-—the very young, the criminal and the weak-minded. This scheel of thought has faith in hu man nature and believes that the pro duction of superior individuals is the main purpose of civilization. The mor alists have faith in the state, in law and in force, and aim at the production of an orderly whole, even though individ uality suffer in the process. A Typical Reformer A typical representative of the ideal of uplift-by-force is l)r. Wilbur F. Crafts, superintendent of the Interna tiona! Reform Bureau, with whom ve had a talk recently about the state of the public morals. Dr. Crafts and ais organization have been blamed for the oroject to pass a Federal Sunday ihie law. He denies that this is the -se Ile says that the proposition for a fed eral law came from a couple of state conferences of the Methodist church in the south, that no such law has been introduced in congress, and that the movement for such a law is not to be taken seriously. He is trying merely to have a Sunday Blue Law passed for the District of Columbia. He says that dent Wilson still retains his faith in democracy. It is beyond question the hope of the human race. Whether the President has accomplished much in permanent world popularity for this gospel of "government by the people" or whether he has always given us the best example of a truly democratic ruler are other questions. They are not vital questions since the elections. But it is undoubtedly true that there never has been a time since the modern manifesta tion of democracy became a power in the world when it. was so important that some statesman chould champion and some nation exemplify the practi cability, if not, indeed even the possi bility,' of efficient democratic govern ment. ... . , The president is right in urging that America present to a dubious world the spectacle of a democracy in effective ac tion. If we fail, the very principle of democracy fails with us. If we, with our unlimited resources, our high aver age of intelligence, our comparative freedom from outside menace, cannot work this system of permitting the av erage mine to select the superior and equipped minds which aie to guide our public endeavor, then no people on earth can work it, especially if they carry anything like our vast responsi bilities.

The Pilgrim Fathers, we are told, never made any Christmas presents. There are soma ways in which we have California and the district are the only parts of the United States where ade quate Sunday laws do not already exist. What he favors chiefly is a campaign for the enforcement of laws alreads on the books. Dr. Crafts has long been engaged in trying to induce congress to pass laws affecting the public morals. He knows to a nicety what is constitutional and what is not, and how to claim the sup port of American tradition for his proj ects. He does not take any positions from which you can easily route him. Thus he is well aware that to make the observance of the Sabbath as a religious day compulsory is legislation respecting religion, and that is forbidden by^ the constitution and by tradition, too. This is theoretically a land of religious free dom. Jews, Jfohammedans, Buddhists, followers of Pythagoras, Nietzehe, and Confucius, free-thinkers, atheists and Pantheists, have theoretically just as much right to live and worship or not worship in this country as the most orthodox Christian. To all of them and many others the Sabbath means nothing. It is therefore not constitutional to en force the observance of the Sabbath by federal law, and it is not in accordance with American traditions of liberty to enforce it by any other kind of law. Two Kinds of Sunday. Dr. Crafts therefore takes the posi tion that there are two Sabbaths—a reli gious and a civil Sabbath. He says that the civil Sabbath is a necessary day of complete rest, and that as such it is a part of American tradition. He says there is no more wrong in legislating for a six-day week than there is in legis lating for an eight-hour day. What he wants, he says, is simply the prohibition of all commercial activity and all work, except what is absolutely necessary, on Sunday. He also wants laws against noise on Sunday so that Christians shall not be disturbed in their mediations. The analogy between the six-day week and the eight-hour day is, of course, not perfect. Eight-hour day legislation simply says that the employer shall not hire the laborer for more than eight hours a day. It does not restrict the activity of "either of them for the rest of the dav. But the proposed Sunday law would forbid you from engaging m any gainful occupation on Sunday, no matter what your religion, or how great your need. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that Dr. Crafts has taken a crafty position. He does not deny that he would like to see a federal law prohibiting all work and amusement on Sunday, but he says that he considers such a law impractic able. He also admits that he wants Sunday blue laws passed in order that the youth of the country will go to dav school more. He says that juvenile crime is on the increase, and that this increase is due more than anything else to the fact that boys do not go to Sunday school as much as they used to. He says that a boy who goes to Sunday baseball games is far more apt to be come a criminal than one who goes to Sunday school. Thus he admits that he wants a Sun day blue sky law for the effect it will have on church attendance. He there fore hopes that it will be a religious law *n effect although he puts it forward as a civil health law. Dr. Grafts is a moral reformer ot the more broad-minded and intelligent type. He realizes that he has sincere rind intelligent opponents and that they have some right on their side._ But there seems to be just a touch of equi vocation in the way he meets their ob jections. [>r. Crafts is opposed to smoking, but does not favor legislation on the sub ject except as applied to minors. He believes dancing should be controlled by a rigorous enforcement of laws against obscene practices. He is opposed to literature which might be considered suggestive, and here again he believes in the rigorous enforcement of laws al ready in existance. He is in favor of severely censoring the movies and the stage. He is of course a strong sup porter of prohibition. Here are the chief things that were banned by the blue laws of our Colon ial ancestors. Dr. Crafts is against them, too. He believs that if they could be abolished the world and the human race would be better off. But he recognizes that they can't be abol ished by law. And his recognition of that fact shows that the friends of per sonal liberty, though in minority, are not wholly overwhelmed. to hand it to those old fellows.—-Boston Transcript.
