Headquarters There Frorn Reed the Next Speaker From Onr Regular Correspondent Washington Dec 7th 1890 The reign of Mark Hanna b as openpd in Washington He is attracting more attention from Republican Senators aud Rep resentatives than the opening of CongresB and the Presidents message combined and he seeiuB to be greatly enjoying it Congress has uo lavois to dis tribute at this session while Hanna has been by the bar rel The republicans who have been reelected to congress want < o work Hanna for their friends and those who will ceaBe to draw Congressional salaries on the 3rd of March are anxious to make connection with other public salaries at the earliest possible moment lhereafterand they racognize the necessity of getting on good terms with Hanna in order to do so Han na has no particular respect or reverence for anything except money Ho went through the pretense of listening to protents by the local republicans against the selection of a gold democrat for chairman of the Inaugura tion Committee but he never has any idna of going bark on the promise he had made to the clique of millionaire real estate speculators to Beiect the man they had nanind for the Dlace both as a reward for hia campaign contribution and as a means of putting a man under their control in a way to get into the good graces of McKin ley and into a local office where he ran influence the expendi tun1 of the district of Columbia funds in a way to benefit their investments Iff wanted any thing from Hanna I should hunt up the millionaire who had contributed to his commit tee for a backer instead of bothering with political in fienco MarK regards politics as simply a question of money and not of principles and 1 make the prediction right now now that the millionaires of the country will be fur more in fluential with the McKinley ad ministration than the politic ians How to do nothing while pretending to be trying to do something will be the motto of tho republican leader during the present session of Congress It has been fully decided at Canton that an extra session of congress shall b called to pass a tarilf bill and that noth ing must be done atthis ses sion to give thp republican op ponents of an exlra session of whom thero are many an ex cuse for saying there is no necessity for one Uader the circntnstances this will not be a difficult task The regular appropriation bills can easily be manipulated bo as to take up all the time of the short session President Clevelands seven teen thousand word message to congress is from a literary point of view n well written document J is
