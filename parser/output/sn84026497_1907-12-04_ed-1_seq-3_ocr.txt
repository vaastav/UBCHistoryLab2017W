In the special ses sion of the legislature only two votes were registered against the bill. The dry states now ore: Maine, Kansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma,. Georgia and Alabama, "Thk free silver craze," aayn Col. Wat terson, with his weather eye directed Nebraska-ward, "for it If was not a craze it was nothing, began by diiviug the oldest Democratic leaders out of publio Ufa" The party now, the colonel continues, is "a close corporation under the one-man power, ba-ed not upon character, convic tion and Intellect, but upon proscription, intolerance and rracbine methods." Many other Southerners are of the same opinion, but are less outspoken. Col. W. J. Bryan says the doukey is a better emblem for a party than the ele phant, because the donkey is a patient, haid-working animal, a burden-bearer and a useful servant of mankind, while the elephant is seldom seen except upon dress pnrade. This may all be true, but it, perhaps, never occurred to anybody that either emblem bad any algninVance other than the convenience ot the car toonist. It might be said in defense of the elephant, however, that he baa a bushel of brains. -Punzy Spirit, The veteran pedestrian, Edward Pay son Weston, ended bis tramp of 1,113-1 miles, from Portlaud, Maine to the Fed eral Building, Chicago, Nov. 27, at 12:15 p. m. He lelt Portland October 29, at 6 p. m., tbus making bis traveling time, exclusive of Sundays, 14 days, 19 hours 15 minutes. AVestoo did not walk on Sundays, because of a promise made his mother many years ago, when be was a young man. The veteran pedestrian is about 70 years of age. Id 1867 Mr. Wes ton made the journey afoot from Portland, Me,, to Chicago, and tbis time he broke his record of 40 years ago by oue day, 3 hours and 25 minutes. This is "stepping some" for a 70-year-old, and has perhaps never been equalled, and may never be in tbe future. . The sixtieth Congress assembled at noon Monday and tbe formula of swear ing in the members was quickly goue through with. This being a new Con gress all members-elect were svorn. "Uncle" Joe Cannon was again elected speaker, and about all the former officers were re-elected, Including Alexander McDowell of this district as chief clerk. Upon the completion of the organization of tbe two branches adjournment was taken out ol respect for deceased mem bers until Tuesday, when President Roosevelt's message was rend, Tbe doc ument is a lengthy one, but like all of Mr. Roosevelt's utterances, is intensely interesting and vigorous on all the great national problems of the hour. The Rk publican prints today tbe message in full as to tbe most vital and momentous questions dlscmsed by tbe President, aud we recommend its careful perusal by all our readers. Prospective Candidates Should Know, In ylew of the importance of the cam paign for the nomination of candidates for tbe various county offices, and tne number who will likely enter tbe race next8pring, it will be well to make a little study of the new law governing future primary elections, excerpts of which are herewith given: Section 4. No candidate and no treas urer of any political committee, shall P7i K,se or lend, or agree to pay, give or lend either directly or indi rectly, any money or other valuable thing for any nomination or election ex penses whatever, except for tbe following purposes: For printing, advertising, traveling expenses and personal expenses incident thereto; for dissemination of in formation to tbe public; for the employ ment of watchers at primary meetings and elections; for transportation of voters to and from polls. Section 5. Every candidate for nomi nation at any primary election, caucus, or convention, whether nominated there at or not, shall, within fifteen days after the same was held, if the amount received or expended shall exceed the sum of fifty dollars, and every candidate for election, and every treasurer of a political commit tee or person soling as such treasurer shall, within thirty days after every elec tion at which such candidate was voted for, or with which Buch political commit tee was concerned, if tbe amount re ceived or expended shall exceed tbe sum of fifty dollars, file wltb the proper offi cers a full, true and detailed account, sub scribed and sworn or affirmed to by him, before an officer authorized to administer oaths, setting forth each and every sum ol money contributed, received or dis bursed by him, for election expenses, the date of each contribution, receipt and dis bursement, the name of the person irom whom received or to whom paid, and the object or purpose for which the same was disbursed.

DECK. Congressman Wheeler is Ready for the Fray. A Washington, D. C, dispatch to tbe Oil City Blizzard, uuder date of Novem ber 29tb, says: "Congressman and Mrs. Wheeler and party arrived here on Thursday and have taken possession of their apartments at the New Wlllard Hotel for tbe sesslou of Congress. Mr. Wheeler will to-night at tend tbe Republican caucus when the officers for the new House will be selected, Including the popular Major McDowell, of Mercer County, who will again be chosen as clerk ot that body. On Monday Mr, Wheeler will participate in tbe or ganization of the House, take the oath ol office from SpeaKer Cannon and seleot the seat that be will occupy when the drawing takes place. "As tbe rooms to be occupied in tbe new office building by the members will not be ready for use for two months yet, Mr. Wheeler has leased an office in tbe modern Colorado building, where bis secretary, Uus B. Evans, will be in charge, aud the two will there look after tbe numerous requests from the district aud have them attended to. "Mr. Wheeler is realizing that his new job demands that he be a good messenger for bis constituents and be proposes to at tend to that portion of bis work and with the assistance of Mr. Evan nothing will be neglected. Since the 4th of Marcb Mr. Wheeler has secured the allowance of numerous pensions for old soldiers and their heirs In bis district, and now that be and Mr, Evans will be here regularly all claims will be pressed to the limit. Mr. Evans la proving to an able and efficient bustler and aid to Mr. Wbeeler. "Among tbe appointments that will be sent to th Senate next week for confir mation will be that of a Mr. Wright to be postmaster at Youngsville, Warren Coun ty, vice Jackson, deceased. Mr. Jackson died in August, and a lively and interest ing fight sprung up oyer that f 1,500 job. When Mr. Wheeler returned from bis European trip be was called upon to make a selection in this fight, and after carefully examining all the papers filed by the half dozen applicants It was appar ent that Mr. Wright not only possessed the strongest endorsements, iut tbat be was the popular choice for the office. As the contest bad become quite bitter, Mr. Wbeeler was urged by prominent repub licans to pass all tbe avowed candidates by and select a compromise candidate, but be did not believe Hint would be fair deal, aud decided to recommend tbe appointment of Mr. Wright." Neighborhood Soles. Joshua Davis, president of tbe Kane Banking and Trust company and one of tbe foremost citizens of the town, is dead at that place. Warren councilman are considering tbe problem of purchasing tbe water plant at that place. The company owning the plant has been asked to fix a price, and also interrogated as to the terms on wbicb the purchase price may be paid. Lawrence Fleming, of Sbamburg, where he is employed as a tool dresser, is In theTitusvlIlehoBpital suffering from a badly smashed leg in wbicb both bones are broken. Thursday afternoon last he was lowering a barrel of cider into the cellar when tbe cask got away and rolled on him. A trained nurse employed by a family In Easton was followed into tbe bouse tbe other night by a big negro. Iuatead of fainting or screaming she took a big knife from tbe k itcben and cbased the colored gentleman a couple of blocks. These shorter methods with rogues are becom ing quite popular. Proceedings have been started to oust the mayor of Erie. The charge against him is violation of tbe corrupt practices act. It is alleged tbat be promiscuously treated the voters to liquor and cigars without including them in his sworn election expense account. Other candi dates better take notice. The postoffice department has advised Postmaster Morgan of Franklin, that un less the roads of the country are repaired soon, the rural free delivery service over tbem will be suspended and perhaps dis continued. As an agency for securing good roads the postoffice department Is second to noue for effectiveness, A bunter came to town over tbe S. & T. Wednesday to have bis hand dressed by a physician. He had the hand, which was enclosed in a woolen mitten, over tbe muzzle of a Savage rifle when it was accidentally fired off. The injury to tbe band was slight, but the mitten was badly used up. We did not learn tbe name of tbis lucky hunter. Sheffield Observer. J. O. Winger, a young man of Grand Valley, bad a wonderful escape from death in Tidioute early Thanksgiving morning. He was returning home from a dance in Tidioute, driving a team at tached to a light buggy over the crossing near the Tidioute passenger station, when his buggy was struck by a southbound P. R. freight train. The buggy was smashed and the man thrown for some distance, but be escaped with nothing more serious than bruises. Tbe team was unburt aud, liberated by tbe smash ing of the buggy, ran away. On Friday Norman Cross, of Partbenia, Warren county, killed a fine buck, at Dunn's Eddy, on the Allegheny river. It was the largest seen in that part of tbe country in recent years, baviug nine prongs and weighing over 200 pounds. Young Cross is 17 years of age. He used but one bullet in killing his game, tbat one going directly through the heart. This is bis second deer, be having estab lished a record by getting one last year. Under tbe circumstances it would appear tbat Mr. Cross should issue an invitation to President Roosevelt, inasmuch as there are bear as well as deer in those parts. Titusville Herald.

Then the Btipt lutlon should he nmdc that no party receiving campaign funds from the treasury should accept more than a fixed ntnount from any Individual sub scriber or donor, and the necessary publicity for receipts and expenditures could without difficulty be provided. Tho Army. The president recommends legisla tion to Increase the number of officers in the army, especially In the mcdlca! corps. The rate of pay of officer should !e greatly Increased, he de Clares. There should be a relatively even greater Increase In the rate of pay of enlisted men If we are to keer (he army In shape to be effective !c (line of need. The president recora meuds severe examination of officer! for promotion up to tho rauk of major From that point promotion should be purely by selection. He speaks of th recent physical test of army officer with emphatic approbation and recotn mends n bill equalizing the pay ol officers and men of the army, navy marlue corps aud rcveuue cutter serv Ice. The Navy. Concerning the navy tbe president says: J, In my judgment, we should this year provide for four battleships. But it is idle to build battleships unless, lr addition, to providing tho men and tht means for thorough training, we pro vide tho auxiliaries for them unless we provide docks, the coaling stations the colliers and supply ships that tuej need. We are extremely deficient it coaling stations aud docks on the Pa cific, and this deficiency should not longer 1m permitted to exist Plenty of torpedo boats and destroyers should ' 1 built fJotb ou the Atlantic and Pa clfic coasts fortifications of the besl type should be provided for all out greatest harbors. Until our battle fleet is much largei than at present it should never be spill Into detachments so far apart that they could not iu event of emergency be speedily united. Our coast Hue is on the Pacific just as niucli as on the At lantic. The battle fleet should now and then be moved to tbo Pacific, jusf as at other times It should be kept In the Atlantic. When the Isthmian canal Is built the transit of the battle fleet from one ocean to tbe other will b comparatively easy. Until it Is bulll I earnestly hope that the battle fleet will be thus shifted between the twe oceans every year or two. The battfc fleet Is about starting by the strait ot Magellan to visit the Taciflc coast Sixteen battleships are going under th command of Rear Admiral Evans, wbll eight armored cruisers and two othei battleships will meet him in San Fran cisco, whither certain torpedo destroy ers are also going. No fleet of such size has ever made such a voyage, and it will be of very great educational us to all engaged In It. The only way by which to teach officers and men how to handle the fleet so as to meet every possible strain and emergency in time of war is to have them practice undei similar conditions iu time of peace. The president recommends the In creased pay for both officers and enlist ed men and advises promotion by se lection above the grade of lieutenant commander. Foreign Affairs. In foreign affairs, tho president says, this country's steady policy Is to be have toward other nations as a strong and self respecting man should behavt toward tho other men with whom h is brought Into contact In other word9, our aim Is disinterestedly to help othet nations where such help can be wisely given without the appearance of med dling with what does not concern us, to be careful to act as a good neighboi and at the same time in good natured fashion to make it evident tbat we dc not intend to be imposed upon. The president refers at length to The Hague peace conference. Ue believes It accomplished much good work. Postal Savings Banks. The president says on postal affairs I commend to tho favorable consid eration of the congress a postal sav ings bank system as recommended bj the postmaster general. Timid deposl tors have withdrawn their savings foi the time being from national banks trust companies and savings banks, in dividuals have hoarded their casb and the workingmen their earnings, al! of which money has been withheld aud kept in hiding or in the safe de posit box to the detriment of prosper ity. Through the agency of the posta' savings banks such money would Ik restored to the channels of trade, tc the mutual benefit of capital and labor. I further commend to the congress the consideration of the postmastei general's recommendation for an ex tension of the parcel post, especially ou the rural routes. It would be most desirable thing to put the fourth class postmasters In the classified serv ice. Other recommendations are: Deepening of the inland waterways, especially of the Mississippi river sys tem, to make them great national high ways. The repeal of the tarirfi on, lores! products, especially the duty oa wood pulp. The ameuduient of the public land laws to make them more effective against land grabbers and more favor able to bona fide settlers. Retention of the government's title to public coal and other mineral lands. Extension of the national forest re serves. Citizenship for the people of Porto Rico. Freer local self government for Alas ka. Encouragement of the merchant ma rine, particularly of an ocean mall Hue to South America. Remission of the Boxer Indemnity and freer entry for Chinese students coming to America. For any of the ordinary diseases of theskin Chamberlain's Salve is excellent.

A Remarkable Career. For three score years The Dispatch has been the leading newspaper of Pittsburg, It has had not only local reputation, but national fame as one of the great newspa pers of tbe United States. Tbis reputation has rested upon quality Tho Dispatch is Pittsburg's paper of pres tige, thk Pittsburg paper known to all tbe country. Tbe Dispatch was pre-emi nent in its field when all papers wore sold for 3 cents. When coteioporaries sold for a penny The Dispatch enjoyed the distinction of having been preferred at twice the cost of competitors, Whyr Quality tbat tells. Each issue of The Dispatch is better than tbat of the day betore. Its aim is constant improvement; It is continually adding to its facilities forgetting the news, Its enterprise is untiring. More than tbis, Tbe Dispatch is liked because it telle the truth without color or bias. Being the only independent paper it is not allied witb tbe political parties or cliques. It tells both sedes of the story so that Its readers can compare Issues and form honest conclusions. Unrivaled news facilities enable tbe Dis patch to print exclusively (be best local, State, national and foreign news in all de partments. Tbe sporting pages are recognized as authority. Its special features and departments are superior to all others. Its editorials are fearless and independ ent. Its editorial page is not approached in readability, attractiveness or interest. The Dispatch has always been worth 2 cents. Now that all tbe Pittsburg morn ing papers are being sold for tbe same price it Is inevitable tbat the public will prefer a real 2-cent paper tbat has won popular approval on that basis aud tbat It will hereafter have an even greater cir culation. Since all the morning papers will cost the same the public will naturally see that it gets tbe beat. How Diphtheria la Contracted. Oue often bears the expression, "My child caught a severe cold which develop ed into diphtheria," when tbe truth was that the cold bad simply left tbe little one particularly susceptible to the wander ing diphtheria germ. When Chamber lain's Cough Remedy is given it quickly cures the cold and lessens the danger ol diphtheria or any other germ disease be ing contracted. For sale by Dunn A Ful ton.
