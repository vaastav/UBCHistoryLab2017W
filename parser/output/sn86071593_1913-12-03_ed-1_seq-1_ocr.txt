TO SEPARATE RAILROADS New Haven System to Effect a Complete Reorganization of Its System IN ORDER TO AVOID ACTION BY COURT Separation of Boston & Maine and Trolley Lines and ReUnciuishment of Control of Steamship Lines Elliott at Conference in Washington. WASHINGTON, Dec. 12.", The New Haven railroad will effect a eomplete reorganization, divorce its steamship. trolley and railroad holdings, inch,,!;,.,, the Hoston & Maine and bring itself entirely within the Sherman anti-trust act. This was confidently rejiorted in of li' ial circles last night following day's negotiations between ft,i,m. General McL'ev nobis and ollicials of the .New Haven. In order to avoid eoo.f action, the railway must a,-t in the im- me, iitue iuture. Although no agree ment htis been entered info l.vtl,., railroad with the department of justice to nicer the demands of Attornev Gen eral McRevnolds, the contemj-lated agreement would provide: For a sej.aration of tho New Haven and the Hoston & Maine railroads. tor a separation of the New Haven and its troilcy lines in Massachusetts, iwio.ie island and oilier tatos. For a relinquishment by the .'ew Havm of its control of steamshi. lines, some of which are held hv th. department to eomi.eto for the" New York P.oston trntlie. For the nullification of the New Haven's agreement with the Hoston & Albany railroad. A solution of the problem of reor ganization by the acceptance of such a jdan would not prevent the dej-art-ment from resorting tl criminal j,r,, sc ent ion under the Sherman law of New Haven officials and directors who held oil!,,, when the New Haven combined those transportation systems. The question of indictments 'has boon talk ed over at the department, but no final deci-ion has boon reached. lho directors and ollicials who have assume,, ,,(:,.,. ,,.,.,., j v would not ho prosecuted. The whole New Haven .rohem was gone over in great detail at a confer ence between tho attorney general, How ard Ellmt. chairman of the hoard of the New Haven; E. I ). Robbins, its general counsel; Edgar .1. Rich, general counsel for the Hoston and Maine; L. S. Storrs. vi-e j. resident of the tro'llev liues. and John W. Crim, counsel fo'r Now Haven. 

WASHINGTON. Dec. ., The con ference between the rejuesentatives of the New Haven railroad and Attorney (ieneral McRevnolds was continued to day at the dej.artment of justice.' Mauy difliculties in the way of an agreement to prevent prolonged litigation were solved, but several points remain to be settled before the department will consent to dissolution without court notion.

Fletcher Urged to Grant Murder er Bosworth a Respite. MONTPELIER, Dec. .1. Gov. Allen M. M. Fletcher has received i.etitJona asking him to suspend the death sen- : tence of Arthur Hosworth until the ; next sitting of the legislature to j which he has replied that such action on his part would avail little, for un- j dor the change made in the tati. .n. : stitution last March the final word now rests with the governor. The power to commute the death penalty was taken from the legisla- turc at that time, and the governor was given nippiest ioiie.l authoritv to pardon or io,ri,-ve. The point has evidently escaj-. the notice of l'.os worth's friends. It is understood the number of requests for executive clem ency in P.osvvorth -s behalf are few. When Gov. Fletcher visited the idato prison at Windsor this week he did not see Hosworth, win, is now in soli tary confinement, but the prisoner was seen by Lieut. Gov. Frank E. Howe and ChaiU-s Plumlev, sj.eaher of the House of Representatives, through the bars of the death house. Hosworth is in line physical con dition due to a good appetite and an hour's exercise daily. The state of ficers were making tho rounds of the state institution on their annual vis it. Hosworth 's execution which is set for Friday. January 2, next, will be the last hanging in Vermont, tis the legislature of F.p substituted elec trocution for hanging. P.osvvorth, who is a Hritish subject, on June !. Fill, shot and hilled Mae Ltibelb in the Essex Junction dej.ot restaurant. The young woman, who was employed as a waitress in the res taurant, had rejected his attention.
