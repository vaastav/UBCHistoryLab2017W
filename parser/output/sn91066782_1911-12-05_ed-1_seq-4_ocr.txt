Vte haven't heard of Rockefeller giv ing his oil stock to feed the poor. The snow will be' welcomed, if for nothing more than to lay the dust. They might as well try to separate fish from water as to disassociate John D. Rockefeller from Standard Oil. Congress opened with fireworks of the Littleton brand. However, it is urgently hoped that the supply was exhausted at the first exhibition. That saving of ?21,283,!)21.43 in the federal expenses for the next fiscal year came too late for Thanksgiving, but it will be just as welcome. When Vermont framed a law in 1908 to prevent "white slave" traffic, the law was thought by many to be needless. Still it was necessary so that it would not have to be used. President Taft will run his message in serial form, taking up a single mat ter in each. However, we do not antici pate the arrangement will abate the interest in them. As a matter of fact, such an arrangement is far more prac tical than the crowding of a great mass of material on many subjects into ij ingle message. No president could hope that the public would be able to give careful attention to a message which contains every subject that pertains to the presidential ollice, no matter how in terestingly the president might be able to write. Therefore, by confining his attention to a single subject in a single message, and not making it too long, President Taft should find himself talk ing to a greater number of people than is customary. The trust message, which is printed verbatim in to-day's paper, is perhaps longer than the average per son wishes, but owing to the nature ot the discussion it demands rather more attention than almost any other subject now before the people. It is to be ex pected that messages on bther less im portant matters will be scaled down in length to compare. 

STRETCHING A TOINT. On what ground does the Ludlow Tribune justify its statement that Jo seph A. LVBopr of Montpelier "was drawn into' a gubernatorial candidacy in the face of definite protest previously filed by him"T Mr. LVBoer has never pro tested against being called to the gov ernorship of Vermont. Nor has he pro tested against being selected as a can didate for the nomination. The extent of his protest, if we read the English language correctly, was to the effect tl he would not enter the list of Repub lican candidates in an unseemly scramble for the nomination. The protest previ ously filed by him was against the meth ods hitherto existing in Vermont, nol against being made a candidate. Therefore, the contemporary does the Montpelier man injustice in asserting that he was dragged into becoming candidate against his will and against his desires, as The Tribune does in the following paragraph from last week's issue: "The drafting process indulged in at Montpelier the other night, by means of which an estimable resident of that city was drawn into a gubernatorial candi dacy in the face of definite protest pre viously filed by him, appears not to have generated a great amount of enthusiasm, even in the territory within which the boom was launched." As to the other part of the insinua tion, regarding the alleged lack of in terest in his entry into the contest, that is largely a matter of opinon. Certain it was, however, that several hundred persons turned out at a time so early in the canvass that enthusiasm is neve.' looked for, that those several hundred people received Mr. DeBoer's statments with thonghtful concern and that Mr. DeBcor' Temarka made deep impression. True, is was not the "rah rah" enthusi asm ; it was something deeper. ;..s- " '

Nj the. two associations fare alike. Destitution Cause of Truancy. Some caftes of destitution so bad that it was reported children couldn't go to school because they hadrtt shoes and clothing were reported by Dr, Joe V. Jackson. He stated that five children were out of school because thpy hadn't the clothing to wear, two being in a fam ily in which either the eighth or ninth child had recently been born another iu a widow's family of either six or seven children (he eouldn't say accurately), still another being in a family where the mother had just died. A like situa tion in which two girls were left alone while their mother was in jail was re ported. To all of these Alderman McLeod of the charity committee asserted that no report had come to the committee, that if report had come the city would have rendered the assistance merited. In at least one of the cases mentioned, he reported, the committee had clothed the children at the opening of the school year, so that they could attend school. It was also asserted that sometimes chil dren or their parents make the alleged lack of suitable clothing an excuse for not having the children in school, but not necessarily in the cases referred to. The! charity committee was instruct ed to look into the cases. A second complaint by Dr. Jackson, to the effect thnt' the city dump is "rot ten," "filthy," and otherwise obxonious, was referred to the health committee, with instructions to see that such con ditions be not allowed to continue. Mayor Mutch stated that the street com mittee had cleaned up the place Borne time ago and that the understanding then was that the health committee should keep it clean. City Sells Land. A warranty deed from the city to Brown, Carroll &, Co. for the sale of land off Depot square for a granite plant was read, and Mayor Mutch was authorized by resolution to execute the deed after some slight changes had been made. The deed conveys eight-tenths of an acre for $2,000, the land running from the new Tiver bed to land of the Central Vermont railroad. City Engineer Reed's report on bridges showed that the Berlin and South Main street structures had been replanked, that the Blackwell street bridge should be replanked next spring, that one string er had fallen off the Berlin street bridge, that only two of the seven props on the South Main street bridge were in work ing order, and that Blight work should be done about the Prospect street and Granite street bridges. The report was accepted, and the recommendations were ordered carried out. Select Site for Horse Fountain. Selection of a site at the corner of South Main and Hill streets for the horse fountain which was removed from the city square to permit of the placing of the granite fountain, given by the National Humane Alliance asite which had been chosen by the water and street committees was approved. Alderman Willey stated that one condition of the gift of the granite fountain was that the old fountain be placed in some other part of the city. It was suggested that a light over each of the fountains is n necessity. The lighting committee prom ised to look after the matter, Alderman Rossi saying that the granite fountain is alreaiiy wired for an electric light. The same committee reported in favor of placing an incandescent light on up per Granite street and one on Willey street, and the report was accepted. The fire committee reported against chang ing the hydrant at the corner of North Main and North Seminary streets,which Mr. Kingston claimed was on his land, until such time as the street line w established. This renort was also ac cepted. The council adjourned at 8:13 1 to take up committee work. TALK OF THE TOWN New wuists just received at Vaughan's.

La Follette Criticises Taft'a Tariff Board Senator I.a Follette, writing his auto biography in the December American Magaiue, refers to what ho calls, "the prewnt so-called turiff board appointed ty Mr. Taft," and goes on to Bay: "While the present tariff board may gather much valuable information, it has no power of commanding the facts from unwilling manufacturers; it doe rot meet the requirement that every member shall be specially trained for the service, it is insultiduntfy supplied with funds, and it reports to the executive rather than the legislative branch, of the government. Its lack of power was well expressed by its capable chairman, Prof. Henry C. fernery, in a speech to the American Association of Woolen and Worsted Manufacturers on DecemlxT 8, 1010. He said: " 'You must not think I om joking about this thing, but there is a joke about it, and the joke is this: I have no powers whatsoever. Ine tariii iioaru has no powers. There is really no such tiling as a tarilf board. Tht law says that for certain purposes the president may "employ such persons" as he sees tit. 1 am one of "such persons," nmi is all.' "The tariff commission should be at the service of the homes of Congress instead of the semi-confidential advisers of tlw president. For it is Congress which is charged with the duty ot iram itig the tariir laws, and there are other things besides mere statistics that Con gress must pas upon. Congress must determine whether a given Industry shall lie protected at all. Then, before Con gress decides that a given industry shall be protected, we want to know how much of its claim for protection is due to its own iuelliciency.
