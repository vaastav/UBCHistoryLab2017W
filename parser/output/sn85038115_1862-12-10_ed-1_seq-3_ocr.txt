PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. . By Telegraph. The President says the correspondence touching foreign affairs .-which has taken place during the last year is herewith sub mitted, in compliance with the request to that effect. If the condition of our rela tions with other nations is less gratifying than formerlg, it is certainly more satis factory than a nation so unhappily dis tracted might have reasonably appre hended. A blockade of three thousand miles of sea-coast could not be established and vigorously enforced in a season of great commercial activity like the present, without committing occasional mistakes and inflicting unintentional injuries upon foreign nations and subjects. In clear cases of these kinds, I have as far as pos sible heard and redresed the complaints by friendly powers. There is, however, a large and augmenting number of doubtful cases, upon which the bovernment is un able to agree with the Governments whose protection is demanded by the claimants. There are more casta in which the Uni ted States or their citizens suffer wrongs n .m "11. .

Some advocates of DBASTIC i'i:rgatiox crroncously hold that griping, nausea, sickness, tenesmus, during the operation of their pills, is a favorable sin: if their pills, expelled with the faces the uiscaied humors left circulating in the system, there would be but little pain or griping. It is the absence cf the bile aud other humors, which their imperfect pills, fail to purge out of the system, that occasions the pain. By examining the stools evac- nated alter severe griping, mcy win oe round thin and watery, AVOID SALINE PURGATIVES! Many persons are in the habit of taking Salts, Seiuitz Water, Magnesia, i.e., to resrulate their bowels. This is erroneous. They succeed in obtaining an evacuation of the watery parts only, leavinijhtbo cor rupt humors, and that is all; but at the expense of the liver, pancreas, kydneys, &C, not one atom of bile orother impuri ties is eliminated from the blood or sernus fluid. If you are dyspeptic, or troubled with heartburn, sour eructions, head-ache, indigestion, these difficulties still remain 40 turtur ana TCX yon; lou uo no? na' 1 . - . 4.. bta Vila n '.!..- . i ,-1 th. . , . - - i . i ; VTiIUJc UHc -t:j lkj r ci I u x uuic, auu w. jcoutinued use of these evacuants are apt to accumulate and form concretions in the iinach.
