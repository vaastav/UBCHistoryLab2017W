THE fel)l'AL-RK;HTS 

AMLNPM KNTS. It isthedraireof the eood people of the whole country that sectionalism as a factor in our politic, should disnpiiear. Thev prefer that no section ot the country should be united in solid opposition to . unv other wi-tic n. The disposition to refuse a prompt and hearty obedience to the eiu::l ri(rlita amendmciits to theConstitu- tion is nil uoit now stands in tut! way of a complete obliteration of sectional lines in our political contests. As lonp as either of these aineniliiients is tlacrantlv violated or dlsre (farded.it is safe to assume that the people who p need them in the Constitution. as ein- lm-iviiiL' lb! lciritiiiutie iesultsot the war tor the l num. and k ho iielieve them to lie wise and nt'cessiirv, ill continue to act tojretlier, and to insist that thev shail be obeyed. The paramount question still is as to the eniov- u.'ent 01 the rijjht, by every American citizen who has the requisite quaiiticationN. to freely cas his vote and to have it, honestly counted. M ith this question rightly settled, the country ill he le.ieved ot the content 10110! the past ; uem will Illilf-U lit Ity liOIM' , KIIU pOUllCIll and pally issues with respect to economy and rmciencj 01 ainiiiiisiration, internal improve nieiits, the tiiriff, domestic taxation, euuca tion, linnncu, and other important subjects, in i ii.ii t-i-i ; tui-ir mil snu e oi aiieuiiou ; but resistance to and nullitication of the re sults 01 tne, war will uniie together in resolute purpose lor their support nil who maintain tlie authority of the Government and the per petuity of the I'nion, and who adequately appreciate the value of the victory achieved. This determination proceeds f roin no hostile aentiment or feeling to any part of the people oi our country, or to any in tneir interests. Tne inviolubilitv of the amendments rests up on the fundamental principle of our Gov ernment. They are the solemn expression of . me wiu 01 tne lieopie 01 tne l nlteet Mutes. The sentiment that theconstitutional rights of all our citizens mut be maintained doea not prow weaker. it will continue to control the Government of the country. Happily, the jusioiy ot me late election snows tnat in many parts of the country w here opposition to the Fifteenth Amendment lias heretofore prevailed, it is diminishing, and is likely to cease altogether, if tinn and well -considered action is taken by Congress. I trust the House of ICepresentntivrg and Senate, which have the right to Judge of the elections, returns, and qualifications of their own members, will ace to it that everv case of viols.! ion of tlie letter or spirit of tlie Fifteenth Amendment is. thoroughly investigated, and that no beneht from audi violation shall accrue to any per son or party. It will be the duty of the Exec utive, with snfticient appropriations for the purpose, to prosecute unsparingly all who have been engaged in depriving citizens of the rights guaranteed to them by the Consti tution. It is not, however, to be forgotten that the best and surest auaranteeof the primary rights of citieni-lup is to be found in that capacity for self -protection which can belong only to a people whose right to universul suffrage is supported by universal education. The means at the command of the local and state author ities are, in many cases, w holly inadequate to furnish free instruction to all who need it. This is especially true where, before emanci- union, the education of the people was neg ected or prevented, in the Interests of slav ery. Firmly convinced that the subject of popular education deserves the earnest atten tion of the people of the whole country, with a view to wise and comprehensive action by the Government of the United State's, I re spectfully recommend that Congi-ess, by suit able legislation and w ith proper safeguards, supplement the local educational funds in the several States w here the grave duties and re aponsibilitiea of citizenship have been devolv ed on uneducated people, by devoting to the purpose grants of the public lands, and, it necessary, by appropriations from the Trea- ury of tfie I'nited States. Whatever Govern ment can fairly do to promote free popular education ought to lie done. Wherever gen eral education is found, peace virtue, and social order prevail, and civil and religious liberty are secure. THE CtYIL SERVICE. In my former annual messages, I have asked the attention of Congress to the urgent necessity of a reformation of the civil-service system of the Government. My views con cerning the dangers of patronage, or ap pointments for personal or partisan consid erations, have been strengthened bv my ob servation and experience in the Kxecutive oftice, and 1 believe these dangers threaten the stability of the Government. Abuses so acinous in their nature can not be permanent ly tolerated. They tend to become more alarming with the enlargement of adminis trative service, as the growth of the country in population increases t he number of officers and placemen employed. The reasons are imperative for the adoption of fixed rules for the regulation of appoint ments, promotions and removals, establish ing a uniform method, having exclusively in view, in every instance, the attainment of the best qualifications for the position in ques tion. Such a method alone is consistent with the equal rights of all citizens, and the moat economical and efficient administration of the public business. Competitive examinations. In aid of impar tial appointments and promotions, have been pond acted for some years past In several of the Executive Departments, and by mv direc tion tbia system has been adopted in the Custom-houses and l'oat -offices of the larger cit ies of the country. In the city of New York over two thousand positions in the civil serv ice have been subject, in their appointments and tenure of place, to the operation of pub lished rules lor this purpose, during the past two years. The results of these practical tnnls have lcen very satisfactory, and have confirmed my opinion in favor of this system of selection. All are subjected to the same tests, and tiir. reault is fife from prejudice by jM-rsonal favor or partisan influence. It se cures for the position applied for, the liest qualific-ationsattainableaniong the competing applicant. It is an effectual protection from the preasure of importunity wni h, under any other course pursued, largely exacts the time and attention of appointing officers, to their prcat detriment in the discharge of other offi cial duties, preventing the abuse of the serv ice for Mie mere furtherance ofprivateor party puinxisea, and leaving the employee of the Government, freed from the obligations Imposed by patronage, to dejend solely uon merit for retention and advancement, and with this constant incentive to exertion and Improvement. 1 hese invaluable results have been attained in a high degree in the offices where the rules for appointments by competitive examination .iiavc been applied. A method w hich so approved itself by ex perimental tests at points where such tests may lie fairly considered conclusive, should lie "extended to all subordinate positions un der the Government. I believe that a strong and growing public sentiment demands im mediate measures for securing and enfon iifn the highest possible efficiency in the civil service, and its protection from recognized abuses, and that the experience referred to lias demonstrated the feasibility of such measures. The examinations in the Cnstom-honses and IVst-oillcc have been held under many cmban assments and without provision for compensation for the extra labor performed by the o.'fii rs w ho Rave conducted thetn, and whoso oomiiicnilabie intTest in the improve ment of the public service has induced this devotion of time and lnlar without pecuniary leivurd. A continuance ot these laboi-s ura tni:ous!y ought not to be expected, and ii li on' an appropriation by Congress for compen sation, it is not practicable to extend the sys. tern el examinations ircnentUy thro'.tuhout tlie civil service:. His also highly important th it ali soch exawdita: iM "siiouM be conducted i;pun s uuiiorin sysu-m iin under jjcucrai su pervision. Section ITTiSof the Revised Stat utes authorizes the rresfdent to presc ribe the regulations for admission to the civil service of the I'nited States, and for this purpose to emjHoy suitable persons to conduct the requi site inqniriea with retcrence to "the titness of each candidate, in resjiect to age, health, character, knowledge, aad ability, for the branch of service imo, which he seeks to en ter;" but tlie law i practically Inoperative for want of the requisite appropriation. I theiefore recommend an appropriation of fiS.oou per annum to meet the expenses of a commission, to be appointed by the President In accordance with the terms of this section, whose duty It shall be to de vise a Just, uniform and efficient system oi comnetititive examinations, and to super vise the application of the same throughout the entire civil servic e of the Government. I am ersuaded that the facilities which such a commission will afford for teating the fitness ttf tlx who apply for office will not only be as welcome a relief to members of Congress as it w ill "oe to the President and heads of epartments, but that it will a so greatly tend to remove the causes of embarrassment which now Inevitably and constantly attend the conflicting claims of patronage between the Legislative and Executive Departments. The most effectual check uDon tho pernicious competition of influence and official favorit ism, in the bestowal of office, will be the sub stitution of an open comjictition of merit be tween the applicants, in which every one can make hid own record with the assurance that his siiecess will denend UDon this alone. I also recommend such legislation as, while leavimi even? officer as free as any other citi zen to express his political opinions and to nse his means for their advancement, shall also enable him to feel an aafe as any private citizen in refusing an uenianus upon nis sal arv for lxilitical nurpoaes. A law which should thus guarantee true liberty and Justice to all who arc engaged in the public service. and likewise contain stringent provisions against the use of official authority to coerce the political action of private citizens or of otlu iaJ subordinates, is greatly to oe uesireu, The most serious obstacle, however, to an Improvement ot the civil service, and es neciall v to a reform in the method of annolnt uient and removal, has been found to be the practice, under what is known as the spoils system, uy wmcu me umtoiiiuiig sower una neen so largely encroacnea upon oy mem hers of Congress. The first step in the re form of the civil service must be a complete divorce between Congress and tho Kxecutive in the matter of appointments. The corrupt ing doc-trine that " to the victors belong the spoils," Is inseparable from Congressional patronage as the established rule and prac tice oi pai ties in power, it comes to ue un durstood by applicants for office, and by the people generally, that Representatives and senators are entitled to aisoursa the patron age of their respective districts and States. It is not necessary to recite at length the evils resulting from this invasion of the Executive I unctions, rue true principles ot govern ment on the subject of appointments to office, as stated in tho National Conventions of the leading parties of the country, have airain and Hiram been a pproved by the A mei ican people.aud nave not been called in question in any quarter. These autnentic expressions ot nuiiiic opinion upon this all -important subject, are the statement of principles that belong to the constitutional structure oi tne Government. Under the Constitution, the President and Heads of Departments are to make nomina lions for office. The Senate is to advise and consent to appointments, and the House ol Representatives is to accuse and prosecute faithless officers. I lie best interest oi tne pun lie service demands that these d.stinctions be respected: that Senutors and Kcprescntatives who may be Judges and accusers, should not dictate appointments to office." To this end the co-operation of the legislative Depart ment of the Government is required, alike by the necessities of the case and bv publicopin- ion. Members of Congress will not be relieved from the demands made upon them with ret- erence to apiiointiiieiits to omee until, bv leg islative enactment the pernicious practice is condemned ana lerDiuaen. It is therefore recommended that an act be passed dclining the relations of members of Congress with respect to appointment to ot lice bv the President : and I also recommend that the provisions of Section 17t7, and ot the sections following, of the Kevised statutes, comprising the Tenure-of -olfice act, of March 2. lstw. be repealed. believing that to reform the system and methods ot the civil service in our country is one of the highest and most imperative duties or statesmanship, ana tnat it can oe perma nently done oniv oy tne co-operation ot tne legislative and kxecutive Departments of the (ovei nment.i again commend the whole sub ject to your considerate attention. 

POLVGASIV. It Is the recognized duty and purpose of the people ot tne i nitea states to suppress poiyg amy where it now exists in our Territories and to prevent its extension. Faithful and zealous etforis have been made by the United States ntiinorities in I tun to eniorce tne laws against it. Flxiierience liasshown tnat the legislation upon this subject, to be effective, requires ex tensive modiiication and amendment, llie longer action is delayed the more difficult it w ill be to accomplish what is desired. Prompt and ueciueu measures are necessary. 1 lie Mormon sectarian organization which upholds pen viramv has tne wnoie power ot inaKiui; and executing tlie loc al legislation ot the lerri- torv. liv its control of the errand and nctit juries, it imsaesses large Influence over the administration ot Justice, fcxeicisiug, as the heads ot this sect do, the local political power of the Territory, they are able to muke ettejctive their hostility to the laws of Congress on the subject of polygamy, and, in tact, eio prevent its eniorcemenu I'oiyga inv will not be abolished if the enforcement of the law dependson those who practice ami uphold the crime. It can oniv be suppressed by taking away the political ower of the sect w hich encourages ana sustains it. me power of Congress to enact suitable laws to protect the Territories la ample. It is not a case of half-wav measures. The political power of the Mormon sect is ini-reasiiig: it controls now one of our wealthiest and most IKiptilons Territories. It is extendingateadily mo other Territories, ivnereve-r it goes it establishes polygamy and sectarian political power. The sanctity of marriage and the amuv relation are tne corner-atone ot our American society and civilization. Keligious liberty and the separation of Church and State are among the elementary ideas of free institutions. To re-estublisli the interests and principles which polygamy and Mormonisni have imperiled, and to fully re open to intel ligemt and virtuous immigrants of all creeds that part of our domain which has been, In a gi eat degree, closed to general immigration I iv intolerant ana immoral institutions, it is recommended that the government of the Territory of I tali be reorisanized. i recommend tnat uongress provine lor tne government of I'tnh by a Governor and J udges, or Commissioners, appointed by tbe rTc-iucnt ana connrmea oy the senate a government analogous to the provisional government established for the Territory northwest of the Ohio, by the ordinance of 17S7. If, however, it is deemed best to con tinue the existing form of local government. recommend that the right to vote, hold of fice and sit on juries in the Territory of Utah be confined to those wno neither practice nor uphold polygamy. If thorough measures are adopted, it is believed that within a few years the evils which now afflict Utah will be eradi cated, and that this Territory will in good time become one of the moat prosperous and attractive ol the new stales ol the t nion. OUK rOREIGS RELATIONS. - Our relations with all foreign countries have been those of undisturbed peace, and have presented no ex-casion lor concern as to their continued maintenance. I The following are the principal features of interest presented in this connection.) our i rienuiv relations witn tne uerman tm- ptre continue without interruption. At the recent International Exhibition of Fish and Fisheries at licrlin, the participation of the United states, notwithstanding the haste with which the commission was forced to make its preparations, was extremely successful and meritorious, winning for private exhibitors numerous awards of a high class, and for the country at large the principal prize ot honor offered by his Majesty the Emperor. - The re sults of tills great success can not but be ad vantageous to this imnortant and irrowinir Industry. There have been some questions raised between the two Governments as to the proper effect and interpretation of our treaties of naturalization, but recent dis patches from our Minister at Berlin show that avoi able progress is making -toward an un derstanding, in accordance with the views of this Government, which makes anl admits no distinction whatever between the rights of a native and a naturalized citizen of the United state. In practice, the complaints of mo lestation suffered by naturalized citizens abroad hre never been fewer than at pre ent. The provision made by Congress, at its last session, for the expense of the commission which had been appointed to enter upon negotiations with the Imperial Government of China, on subjects ot great interest to the relations of the two countries, enabled the commissioners to proceed at one-e upon their mission. The Imperial Government was pre pared to give pixjtnpt and resneH tful attention to the matters brought under negotiation, and the conference jiroceeded with such rapidity and success that, on the 17th of No vember last, two treaties were signed at Pckin, one relating to the introduction of Chinese into this country and one relating to commerce. Mr. Trescot, one of the commis sioners, is now on lifs way home bringing the treaties, and it is expected that they will be received in season to be laid before the Sen ate early in January. QIH BISTER REPCBLICS. In mv last annual message 1 expressed ahopc that tlie prevalence of quiet on the border be tween this country and Mexic o would soon be come so assured as to justify the modification of the orders, then in force, to oiir military commanders, in regard to crossing the fron tier, without encouraging such elisttirbnnce as would endanger tin? jM'aee of the two coun tries. Events moved in accordance with these cxiH'ctations. and the orders were a o ding ly withdrawn, to the entire satisfaction of our own citi.ens and the Mexican t.owrninent. subscqiuM!tly the jieace of tne bonier was ag::in disturbed by a savage forav, under the command ol Chief Vic torio, but. liy the com bined and hsrmonkms action "f the military IOi.es ot bo h countries, his band h. s been broken up and substiitia.l ilost!oetl. There is reason lo believe t4il obacles w hich have so long prevented rapid uudcou- j ventent communication between the United States and Mexico by railway, are on the point of disappearing, and that several im portant enterprises of this character will soon lie set on foot w hich can not fail to contribute largely to the prosperity of the two countries. New" envoys from Guatemala, Colombia, Bolivia, Venezuela and Nicaragua have re cently arrived at this capital, w hose distinc tion and crligbteDmcnt afore! tbe best guar antee of the continuance of friendly relations between ourselves and these sister Republics. The relations betw een this Government anil that of the United States of Colombia have engaged public attention during tbe past year, mainly by reason of the project of an intcToceunic canal across the Isthmus of Pan ama, to .lie built by private capital under a concession fretn the Colombian Government for that purpose. The treaty obligations sub sisting between the United States and Colom bia, by which we guarantee the neutrality of the transit and the sovereignty and property of Colombia in the Isthmus, make it necessa ry that the conditions under which so stu pendous a change in the region embraced in this guarantee should be effected transform ing, as it would, this Isthmus, from a barrier between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, into a gateway and thoroughfare between them, for the navies and the merchant-ships of the world should receive the approval of this Government, as being compatible with the discharge of these obligations on our part, and consistent with our interests as the prin cipal commercial power of the Western Hem isphere. The views which I expressed in a special message to Congress in March last, m relation to this project, I deem it my duty to press upon your attention. Subsequent con sideration has but confirmed the opinion "that it ia the right and duty of the United States to assert and maintain such supervis ion and authority over any interoceanic canal across the Isthmus that connects North and South America as will protect our national interest." The war between the Republic of Chill on the one hand, and the allied Republics of Pern and Bolivia on the other, still continues. This Government lias not felt called upon to Interfere in a contest that is within the bel ligerent rights . of .the parties as inde pendent States. We have, however, always held ourselves in readiness to aid in ace-om-modating their diflerene-e, and have at differ ent times reminded both belligerents of our willingness to render such serv ice. Our good offices, in this direction, were re cently accepted by all the belligerents, and it was hoped they would prove efficacious; but I regret to announce that the measures, which the Ministers of the United States at Santiago and Lima were authorized to take, with the view to bring about a peace, were not success ful. In the course of the war some questions have arisen affecting neutral rights; in all of these the Mini-itcrs of tlie United States have, under their instructions, acted with prompt ness and energy in protection of American in terests. The relations of the United States with the Empire of Brazil continue to be most cordial, 

FOKEK.N TRADE AND COMMERCE. The efforts of the Department of State to en large the trade and commerce of the United States, through the active agency of consular officers and through the dissemination ot in formation obtained from them, have been un- relaxed. The interest in these efforts, as de veloped in our commercial communities, and the value of the information secured by this means, to the trade and manufactures of the country, were recognized by Congress at its last session, and provision was made; for the more frequent publication of- consular and other reports by tbe Department of State. The lirst issue of this publication has now been prepared, and subsequent issues may regularly be expected. 1 he importance and interest attached to the reports ot con sular offieei-s. are witnessed bv the general de mand for them by ail clnssesof merc hants and manulacturers engaged in our foreign trade It is believed that the system of such publi cations is deserving of the approval ot Con gress, and that the necessary appropriations lor its continuance aim enlargement wui com mend itself to your consideration. The prosperous enemies of our domestic industries, and their immense production of the subjects of foreign commerce, invite, nnd even reepiire, an active development of the wishes and inte-rests of our jieople in that di rection. Especially important is it that our commercial relations witn tne Atlantic anu Pacific coasts of South America, with the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico should be direct, and not through the circuit of Eu ropean systems, and should be carried on in our own" bottoms. The full appreciation of the opportunities which our front on the Pa cific Ocean gives to commerce with Japan, China ami the East Indies, with Australia nnd the island groups whicn lie along tuese route-s of navigation, should inspire equal efforts to appropriate to our own shipping, and to administer by our own capital, a due proainiou ui iuis trade. Whatever modifications of our regu lations of trade and navigation may be neces sary or useful to meet aud direct these Im pulses to the enlargement of our exchanges and of ntirearrvine' trade I am snrethe wisdom of Congress will be ready to supply. One initial measure, however, seems to me so clearly useful and efficient that I venture to press it upon your earnest attention. It seems to be very evident that the provision of regular steiim postal communication, by aid from Gov ernment, has been the forerunner of the com mercial predominance of Great Britain on all these coasts and seas, a greater share in whose trade is now the desire and the intent of onr people. It is also manliest that the efforts of other ruropean nations to contend with Great Britain for a share of this com merce have been successful In proportion with their adoption of regular steam postal communication with the markets whose trade they sought. Mexico and the States of South America are anxious to receive such postal communications with this country, and to aid in their development. Similar co-operation may be looked for, in dno time, lrom the Eastern nations and from Australia. It is dif ficult to see how the lead in this movement can be expected from private interests. In respect of foreign commerce, quite as much as in inter nal trade, postal communication seems neces sarily a matter of common and public ad ministration, and thus pertaining to Govern ment. I respectfully recommend to your prompt attention such just and efficient measures as may conduce to the development of our foreign commercial exchanges and the building up of our carrying trade. OUR NATIONAL FINANCES. The condition of the financial affairs of the Government, as shown by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, is very satisf actory. It is believed that the present financial situ ation of the United States, whether consider ed with respect to trade, currency, credit, irrowinir wealth, or the extent nnd variety of our resources, is more favorable than that of anv other country of our time, and has never been surpassed bv that of any country at any period of fts history. All our industries are thriving ; the rate of interest is low ; new rail roads are being constructed ; a vast Immigra tion is increasing our population, capital, and labor; new enterprises in great number are in progress; and oui-commercial relations with other countries are improving.

It is to. tiuiate that this large aurpln reve-. nt.o oe ins at a period wnrn it may o" li- lectiy applied 1 1 me payment of ihe pub.ic debt soon to be redeemable. No public duty has been mot e constantly cherished in the United States than the policy of paying the Nation's debt as rapidly as possible. The debt of the I nited tates, leas cssh in the Treasury and exclusive of accruing inter est, attained Its maximum of $2 74 Il.a7).4,f In August, 1865, aud has since that time been re duced to $1,8S6,0I9,504.65. Of tile princid of the debt. $108,758,101) haa been paid since March 1, 177, elfectinian animal saving of in terest of $6,107,593. The burden of interest has also been diminished by the sale ot bonds bearing a low rate of Interest, and the appli cation of the proceeds to the redemption of bonds bearing a higher rati. The annual saving thus secured since March 1, 1877, is $14.290.4.i3.50 Within a short period over six hundred millions of five and six per cent, bonds will become redeemable. This presents a very favorable opportunity not only to further re duce the principal ot the debt, but also to re duce the rate of interest on that which will remain unpaid. I call the attention ot Con gress to the views expressed on this subject by the Secretary of the Treasury in his an nual report, and recommend prompt legisla tion, to enable the Treasury Department to complete tlie refunding of the debt which is about to mature. ' Tlie continuanceof specie payments has not been interrupted or endamrered since the date of resumption. It has contributed greatly to the revival of business and to our remark able prosperity. Tim fears that preceded and accompanied resumption have proved groundless. No considerable amount of United States notes have been presented for redemption, while very large sums of gold bullion, both domestic and imported, are taken to the miutajind exchange-el for coin or notes. The Increase of coin and bullion in the United States since January 1, 1879, is esti mated at $227,399,428. There are still in existence, uncanceled, $346,681,016 of United States legal-tender notes. These notes were authorized as a war meas ure?, made necessary by the exigencies of the conflict in which the f nited States was then enuaged. The preservation of the Nation's existence required, in the judgment of Con gress, an issue of legal-tender paper money. That It served well tbe purpose for which it was create! is not questioned, but the em ployment of the notes as paper money indefi nitely, after the accomplishment of the object for which thev weie provided, was not contemplated by the frani"rs of the law under which they were issued. Thevo notes long since became like any other pecuniary obligation of the Govern ment a debt to be paid, and when paid, to be canceled as mere evidence of an indebt edness no longer existing. 1 therefore repeat what was said in the anni' il message of la-t year, that the retirement lrom circulation of Ijnited States notes, with the capacity of legal tender In private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress towai ds a safe and sta lsle currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duly of the Government and the interest and security of the people. 

SILVER COINAGE. At the time of the passage of the act now in force requiring the coinage of silver dol- temier character, it was believed by many of the supporters of the measure, that the silver dollar, which it authorized, would speedily become, under the operations of the law, of equivalent value to the gold dollar. There were other supporters of the bill, who, while they doubted a to the probability of this re sult, nevertheless were willing to give the ex pel iinent a lair trial, wit h a view to stop tbe coinage, if experience should prove that the silver dollar authorized by the bill continued to lie of less commeicial v'alue than the stand ard irold dollar. The coinage of silver dollars nnder the act relerrcd to, began in March, 1S78, and lias been coutinucd as required by the act. The average rate per month to the present timo has been $2,276,492. The total ainouiitcoincd priorto the first of November lust was $72,847,750. Of this amount $47,084,450 remain in the Treasury, and only $25,76S.2sl arc in the hands of the Iieople. "A constant effort has been made to ;eep this currency in circulation, and consid erable expense lias been necessarily incur red for this purpose, but its return to the Treasury is prompt ami sure.- Contrary to the confident anticipation of the friends of t he measure at the time of its adoption, the value of the silver dollar, containing 412 grains of silver, has not increased. During the year prior to the passiure of the bill au thorizing its coinage, the market value of the silver which It contained was from ninety to ninety-two cents, as compared with the standard gold dollar. During the last year the average market value of tlie silver dollar has been eighty-eight and a half cents. It is obvious, that the legislation of the last Congress In regard to silver, so far as it was based on an anticipated rise in tne value of silver as a result of that legislation, hns failed to produce the effect then predicted. The longer the law remains in force, requiring as it does the coinage of a nominal dollar, which, in reality, is not a dollar, the greater becomes the danger that this country will be forced to accept a single metal as the sole legal standard of value, in circulation, and this a standaru of less value than it purports to be worth In the recognized money of the world. The Constitution ot the United States, sound financial principles, and our best inter ests, all require that the country should have as its legal-tender money, both gold and sil ver coin, of an intrinsic' value, as bullion, equivalent to that which, upon its face, it purports to possess. The Constitution, in ex press terms, recognizes both gold and silver as the only true legal-tender money. To banish either of these metals from our cur rency is to narrow and limit the circulating medium of exchange to the disparagement of important Interests. The United States pro duces more silver than any other country, and is directly interested in maintaining it as one of the two precious metals which furnish the coinage of the world. It will, in my judgment, contribute to this result if Congress will repeal so much of existing legislation as requires the coinage of silver dollars contain ing oniv 412 S' grains of silver, and in its stead authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to coin silver dollars of equivalent value as bul lion, with gold dollars. This will defraud no man, and will be in accordance with familiar precedents. Congress, on sev eral occasions, has altered the ratio of value between gold and silver, in order to establish it more nearly in accordance with the actual ratio of value between the two metals. In financial legislation every measure in the direction of greater fidelity in the discharge of pecuniary obligations, has been found by ex perience to diminish the rates of Interest which debtors are reouired to rjav. and to in crease the facility with which money can be obtained for every legitimate purpose. Our own recent financial history show s how surely money becomes abundant whenever confi dence in the exact performance of moneyed obligations is established. THE 

ARMY. The Secretary of War reports that the ex penditures of the War Department for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1880, were $39,924, 773 03. The appropriations for this Depart ment, for the current fiscal year, amount to $41,993,630 40. With respect to the Army, the Secretary In vites attention to the fact tnat its strength is limited by statute (Section 1115, Revised Stat utes) to not more than 30,000 enlisted men, but that provisos contained in appropriation Dills have limited expenditures to the enlistment of but 25,000. It is believed the full legal strength Is the least possible force at which the present organization csn be maintained, havlne- In view efficiencv. discinline and econ omy. While the enlistment of this force would add somewhat to the appropriation for pay of the Army, the saving made in other respects would be more than an equivalent for this additional outlay, and the efficiency of the Army would be largely increased. The rania extension oi tne ranroao system west of tlie Mississippi River, and the great tide of settlers which has flowed in upon new territory, impose in tho military an entire change of policy. The maintenance of small posts along wagon ana stage routes ot travel la no longer necessary. Permanent quarters at points selec ted, of a more substantial char acter than those heretofore constructed, will be required. Under existing laws, perma nent buildinirs can not be erected without tbe sanction of Congress, and when sales of mili tary sites and buildings nave been author ized, the moneys received have reverted to the Treasury, and could only become avail able through a new appropriation. It is rec ommended that provision be made, by a general statute, for the sale of such aban doned military posts and buildings as are found to be unnecessary, and for the applica tion of the proceeds to the construction of other posts. While many of the present posts are of but slight value for military purposes, owing to the changed condition of the coun try, their occupation is continued at great expense and inconvenience, because they af ford the only available shelter for troops." The absence of a large number of officers of the line, in active duty, from their regiments. is a serious detriment to the maintenance of the service. The constant demand for small detachments, each of which should bo com manded bv a commissioned officer, and the various details of officers for necessary e.rvice away from their command, occasions a se aririty In the number required for company duties. With a view to lessening this drain to some extent, it is recommended that the law son liorizing the detail of officers from the nc-ti- list as professors of tactics and military K-ienceat certain colleges and universities, be so amended as to provide that all such details be made from the retired list of the Army. Attention is asked to the necessity of pro viding by leiiislation for organizing, arming, and disciplining the active militia of the country, and liberal appropriations are re-1 coi-imended in this behalf. The reports of the Adjntant-General of tlie Army and the Chief of Ordnance touching this subject fully se-t lovth its importance. Especial nttention is asked to the report of the Chief of Engineers upon the condition of our national delenses. From a personal in spection of man ol the fortilicatious referred to, the See-retary is able to emphasize the rec ommendations "made, and to state that their incomplete and th.-lens-less cotuliticn is dis crectitab e to the e-ountty. While other na tions have been Increasing their means tor carrv ing on offensive wai fare and a tacking maritime cities, we have been dormant in p:ep rition for d ;en-e; i-othing of impor ting i! bits been done to-vard stremrtheiiing and finis'iiu o::rc scti.atcd works since our late tii il ivnr, tlurii w.i.i htie itr attains of modem wa.l.uu aud the heavy urinoi ut mod ern fortifications and ships came into nse among the nations, and our earthworks left, by a sudden failure of appropriations sums years since, in all stages of inceimplctlon, are now being rapidly destroyed by the elemients. IMPROVEMENT OP XAVIUABLE WATERS. The two great rivers of the North American Continent, the Mississippi and the Columbia, have tneir na lguhle waters w holly within the limits of the l uiied States, and are of vast importance to our internal and foreign com merce. The permanency of the fmiwrtant work on the south Pass of the Mississippi River soenis now to Ian assured. - There-has been-no failure whatever in the maintenance of the maximum channel during the six months ended Aognst 9, last. This experi ment has opened a broad deep highway to the ocean, and is an improvement, upon the permanent success of which congratulations may be exchanged among people abroad and at home, and especially among the com munities ot the .Mississippi Valley, whose commercial exchanges float In an unobstruct ed channel safely to and from the sea, A comprehensive improvement of the Mis sissippi and its tributaries is a matter of tran scendent importance. These great water ways comprise a system of inland transpor tation spread like net-work over a large por tion of the United States, and navigable to the extent of many thousands of miles. Pro ducers and consumers alike have a common interest in such unequaled facilities forchoap transportation. Geographically, commercial ly and politically they are the strongest tie between the various sections of tlie country.' These channels of communication and inter change sie the property of tbe Nation. Its jurisdiction is paramount over their waters, and the plainest principles of public Inte.Tst require their careful and intelligent supervi sion, with a view to their protection, improve ment, and the enhancement of their useful ness. The channel of the Columbia River, for distance of about one hundred miles from its mouth, is obstructed by a succession ef bars w hich occasion serious delays in navigation, and heavy expense for lighterage and towage'. A depth cif at least twenty feet at low tide should be secured and maintained, to meet the requirements of the extensive and growing inland and ocean commerce it sub serves. The most urgent need, however, lor this great water-way is a permanent improve ment of the channel at the mouth of the river. From Columbia River to San Fran cisco, a distance of over six hundred miles, there is no harbor on our Pacific coast which can be approuehed during stormy weather. An ap propriation of $150,000 was made by the Forty fifth Congress for the commencement ol a break-water and harbor of refuge, to be locat ed at some point between tlie straits of Fnca and San Francisco, at which the necessities of commerce, local and general, will be best accommodated. The amount appropriated is thought to be quite inadequate for the pur pose intended The cost of the work, when finished, will be very great, owing to the w ant of natural advantages for a site at any point on the coast between the designated limits, and it has not been thought to beadvisubleto undertake the work without a larger appro priation. I commend the matter to the at tet tion of Congress. The completion c the new building for the War Department is urgently neeeled, and the estimates for continuing its construction are especially recommended. GENERAL GRANT. I commend to the attention of Congress the great services of the Commander-in-Chief of our armies during the war for the Union, w hose wise, firm, nnd patriotic conduct did so much to bring tliat momentous conflict to a close. The legislation of the United states contains many piece-dents for the recognition of dis tinguished military merit, authorizing rank and emoluments to be conferred for eminent services to tlie country, tu act of Congress authorizing the appointment of a Captain General of the Army, with suitable provisions relating to compensation, retirement, and other details, would, in my judgment, bel together fitting and proper, and would.be warmly approved. by the country. THE WAV T. Tlie report of the Secretary of the Navy exhibits the successful and satisfactory man agement of that De partment during the last fiscal year. The total expenditures tor the year were $12,916,639 45, leaving unexpended at the close of llie year $2,141,682 23 of the amount of available appropriations. The ap propriations for the present fiscal year end ing June 30, laid, aie $15,095,061 45"; and the total estimates for the next fiscal year end ing June 30, 1882, are $15,953,751 61. The amount drawn bv warrant from July 1, 1880, to November 1, 1880, is $5,041,570 45. The recommendation of the Secretary of the Navy, that provision be made for the es tablishment of some form of civil gcA-emiuent for the people of Alaska, Is approved. At present there is no protection of persons or property in that Territory, except such as is afforded by the officers of the United States ship Jamestown. This vessel was dispatched to Sitka, because of the fear that, without the immediate presence of the Na tional authority, there was impending danger of anarchy. The steps taken to restore order have been accepted in good faith by both white and Indian inhabitants, and the'neccs sity lor this method of restraint does not, in my opinion, now exi-t. If, however, the Jamestown should be withdraw n, leaving the people, as at present, without the ordinary, judicial, and administrative authority of or ganized local government, serious conse quences might ensue. THE POSTAL DEPARTMENT. The report of the Postmaster-General ex hibits the con inual growth and the high state of efficiency of the postal service. The opera tions of no Department of the Government, perhaps, represent with greater exactness the increase in the population and the business of the country. In I860 the postal receipts were $s,.M8,067.40; fn 1880 the receipts were $33,315, 479.34. All the Inhabitants of the country are directly and personally interest-d in having proper mail facilities, and naturally watch the Post office very closely. Thiscaiefulover sight on the part of the people has proved a constant stimulus to improvement. During the past year there was an increase of 2,1:14 Post-offices, and the mail routes were extend ed 27,177 miles, making an additional annual transportation of 10,801,191 mile-i. The reve nues of the postal service for the ensuing year are estimated at $W. 845,174. 10, and the ex penditures at $42,473,932, leaving a deficiency to be appropriated out of the Treasury of $3, 630,757.90. The Universal Postal Union has received the accession of almost all the countries and col onies of the world ma utaining organized postal services, and it is confidently expex-ted that all the other countries and colonies now outside the Union will unite: therewith, thus realizing the grand idea and aim of the founders of the Union, of forming, for pur poses of International mail communication, a single postal territory embracing the world, with complete uniformity of postal charges and conditions of international exchange for all descriptions of coi-respondenee. To enable the United States to do its full share of this great work, additional legislation is asked by the Postmaster-Genet al, to whose recom mendations especial attention is called. Tlie suggestion of the Postmaster-General that it would be wise to encourage, by appro priate legislation, the establishment of Amer ican lines of steamers bv our own citizens to carry the mails between our own por!9 and tnose ot Mexico, tentrni America, soutu America, and of trans-Pacific countries, is commended to the serious consideration of Congress. The attention of Congress is also invited to the suggestions of the Postmaster-General in regard to Postal savings. 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The necessity tor additional provision, to aid in the transaction of the business of the Federal courts, becomes each year more ap parent. The dockets of the Supreme Court, and of the circuit courts, in the greater num ber of the circuits, are encumbered with tbe constant accession of eases. In tlie former court, and in many instances in the circuit courts, years intervene before ft is practicable to bring cases to a hearing. Tne Attorney-General recommends tne es tablishment of an intermediate; Court of Er rors and Appeals. It is recommended that the number of Judges of the Circuit Court in each circuit, with the exception of the Second Circuit, should be increased by the ad dition oi anothei Judge; in tpe Second cir cuit that two should be added; and that an intermediate Appellate Court should be formed in each circuit, to consist of tlie Cir cuit Judges and the Circuit Justice, and that in the event of the absence of either of these Judges the place of the absent Judge shonld be supplied by the Judge ot one ot tne lis trfct Courts in the circuit. Such an Appellate Court could be safely Invested with large Jur isdiction, anu us decisions wouiu satisiy suit ors in many cases where appeals would still De allowed to tne Bumeme couix. me ex pense incurred for this intermediate court will require a very moderate increase of the appropriations for the expense-s of tho De- Caitment of Justice. This ree-commendation i commended to the careful consideration ot Congress. It is evident that dehiy f justice, in many instance; oppressive and disastrous to suit ors, now necessarily occurs in the Federal courts, which will in this way be remedied. THE INTERIOR DEPARTMENT THE INDIANS. The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents an elaborate account of the opera tions of that Department during the past year. It gives me great pleasure to say that our Indian affairs appear to be in a more boix'ful condition now than ever before. The Indians have made gratifying progress in ag riculture, herding, and meciiiuiical pursuits. Manv who were afew years, aao in hostile conflict with the Government are quietly set tling down on farms where they hope to "make their permanent homes, builtfing houses and engnjiing in the oe-etipations ot civilized lin-. The introduction of the freighting business among them has been remarkably fruitful of good results, in giving many of tliem conge nial and remunerative employment, and in wtimulatiniz tlieir ambition to e-aim their own support. Their honesty, fidelity and efficiency as can icrs are highly pmi ed. The orgunix.it tion ot a police force of Indians has been equally successful in maintaining law and ol der upon the r servations, and in exercis ing a wholesome moral influence iuotii tne. Inilhin- thcmse-lvcs. I en-icur wilit til -ss-crc ary of t i- imei ior in ti!c reconiinciiila tion t iin th'-pay ol this lorcc be iiKivascd. us an in' cm ut to the best liussui young nicu to t.'.tcr it. . Much care and attention has been devotee- to the enlargement of educational facilities for the Indians. The means available for this important object have been very Inadequate. A iuw additional boarding-schools at lnd.an auenci'-s have been established, and the erec tion of buildings has been begun for several more, but an im-re-ase of the appropriations for tnis Interesting undertaking is greatly neeilf-d to u e onimodate the larve number of Indian children of school age. The number ottered bv the-ir Barents from all parts of the country "for education in the Government schools ia much larger than can be accommo dated with tho uieaus at present available for that purpose. The number of Indian punils at tbe Normal School at Hampton, Virginia, under tlie direction of Gen. Armstrong, has been considerably increased and their progress is highly ene-ouraging. The Indian scli.sU established bv the Interior Department in 1879, at Carlisle, "Pennsylvania, under the direction or Capt. 1-ratt, lias teen equally suc cessful. It bus . now nearly two nun dred nnpils of both sexes, represent. ing a' great variety of the tribes east of the Rocky Monntuin. The pupils in both these Institutions receive not only an elementary English education, but are also instructed in house-work, agriculture, and useful mechanical pursuits. A similar school was established this year at Forest Grove, Oregon, for tbe education of Indian youth on the Pacific coast. In addition tothis, thirty-six Indian txivs and girls were selected tioni tne Eastern Clierokees and placed in boarding- schools in North Carolina, where they are to receive an elementary English education and training in industrial pursuits. Tlie interest snow n tiy Indian parents, even among the so- called wild trilies, in the education of their children. Is very Kratifving. and inves prom ise that the results accomplished by the efforts now making win be ot lasting oenent. The expenses of Indian education have so far been drawn from the permanent civiliza tion-fund at the disposal of the Department of the Interior; but tne fund is now so much reduced, that the continuance of this benen-t-ial work will in the future depend on 8)eci ne anpronriations bv Comrresa for the pur pose, ami I venture to express the hojie that congress win not pe;rmlt institutions so fruit ful of good results, to perish for want of means ior tneir support, un tne contrary, an iucrease ot the number of such schools ap pears to me highly advisubte. The past year has been unusually free from disturbances among the Indian tribes. An agreement has been made with the I tes by whiult they surrender their large res ervation in Colorado in consideration of an annuity to be paid to them, and agree to set tle in severalty on certain lands design-tted for that purpose as farmers, holding lndn id ual title to their land in lee simple, inalien able lor a certain period, in this way a costly Indian war has been avoided, which at ina time seemed imminent, and for the first time in the history of tne country, an Indian nation has giv en up its tribal existence to be settled in severalty and to live as n Uviduals under the cominoa protection of the laws of the country. The conduct of the Indians tiiroughont the country during the past year, wit': but lew noteworthy exceptions, has "been orderly and peaceful. "The guerilla wunare carried on for two years by Victorio and bis band of southern Apaches has virtually come to an end, by the death of that chief and most of his followers, on Mexican sod. The dis turbance's caused on our northern frontier by fitting Hull and bis men, who hud taken ref uge in the Hi it mil dominions, are a. so likely to cease. A large majority ot his followers have surrendered to our military fore -s, and the reiiiuindcr are apparently iu progress of dis ln egrauon. 1 concur w ith the Secretary of tho Interior in expressing the earnest hope that Congress will ut this session take favorable action on the bill providing for the allotment of lauds on the ditlerent reservations in severalty to the Indians, w ith patents conferring lee sim ple title inalienable tor a certain period, and the eventual disposition of the residue of tho reservations, for general settlement, with the consent and for the benefit ot the Indians, placing the latter miner the equal protection of the laws of the c uutry. This measure, to gether with u vig-. nous prosecution ot our edu cational i-t!er;s. ill work tbe most important unci etie -live udvuiice toward the solution of the Indian problem, in preparing for the gradual merging of our Indian population in the great booyof American citizenship. PUBLIC LANDS. A large increase is reported fn the disposal of public lauds tor settlement during t e past year, w hich marks the prosperous growth of our agricu It ural indust ry .and a vigorous mo ve uient of population toward our niioccnpied lands. As this movement proceeds, the codi fication of our land laws, as well as proper legislation to regulate the disposition of pub lic lands, become of more pressing necessity. and I therefore invite the consideration of Congress to the report and the accompanying dralt of a bill, made by the Public Lands Com missihn, which were communicated by tne to Congress at tlie last session. Early action upon this important subject is highly desir uble. The attention of Congress is again asked to the wasteful depredations committed on our public timber-lands, and the rapid and indis criminate destruction of our forests. The urgent necessity for legislation to this end is now generull y recognized. In view of the lawless character ot the depredations com mitted, and the disastrous consequences which will inevitably follow their continu ance, legislation luis again Bnd again been recommended to arrest the evil, nnd to pre serve for the people of our Weste;rn States and Territories the timber needed fur domestic, and other essential uses. The report of the Director of the Geological Survey is a document of nnusual Interest. Tbe consolidation of the various geological and geographical surveys aud exploring en terprises, each of which has heretofore oper ated upon an independent plan, without con cert, can not fail to be of great benefit to all those Industries of the country which depend upon the development of our mineral re sources. The labors of the scientific men, of recognized merit, who compose the corps of the Geological Survey, during the first season ot their held operations and inquiries, ap pear to have been very comprehensive, and will soon lie communicated to Congress in a number ot volumes. The Director of the Survey recom mends that the investigations, carried on bv his burean, which, so far, have been con fined to the so-called public-land States and Territories, be extended over the entire conn try, and that the necessary- appropriation be made for this purpose. This would be par ticularly beneficial to the iron, coal and other mining interests of the .Mississippi Valley and of the Eastern and Southern States. The sub ject is commended to the careful considera tion of Congress. . BUREAU OF AGRICULTURE. The Commissioner of Agriculture expresses tbe confident belief that bis effort in behalf of the production of our own sugar and ten have been encouragingly rewarded. The im portance of tbe results attained have attract ed marked attention at home, and have re ceived the special consideration of foreign nations. The successful cultivation of our own tea,and the manufacture of our own sugar, would make a difference ol many millions of dollars annually in the wealth of the Nation. The report of the Commissioner asks atten tion particularly to the continued prevalence of an infectious and contagious cattle-disease, known and dreaded in Europe and Asia as cattle-plague, or plenro-pneumonia. A mild type of this disease, in certain se tions of our country, is the occasion of great loss to our farmers, nnd of serious disturbance to our trade with Great Britain, which furnishes a market for most of our live-stock and dressed meats. The value of neat-cattle exported from the United States for the eight months ended August 31, 1880, was more than twelve million dollars, and nearly double the value for tbe same penod in 1879, an unexampled Increase of export trade. Your early atten tion is solicited to this important matter. 

EDUCATION. The Commissioner of Education reports a continued Increase of public interest in edu cational affairs, an1 that the public schools generally throughout the country are well sustained. Industrial training is attracting deserved attention, and colleges for instruc tion, theoretical and practical, in agriculture and the mechanic arts, including the Govern ment schools recently established for the In struction of Indian youth, are gidning steadily in public estimation. The Commissioner asks special attention to the depredations com mitted on the lands reserved for the future support of public instruction, and to the very great need of help from tbe Nation for schools in the Territories and in the southern States. The re?ommendatlon heretofore made, is re peated and urged, that an educational fund be set apart from the net proceeds of the sales of public lands annually, the incomeof which, and the remainder of the net annual prfe-ceds, lo be distributed on some sat isfix-torv- plan to tbe States and Territories and the District ot Columbia, 

DISTRICT OF COLCMBL4. , I again commend the general Interests of the District ot Columbia to the favorable con sideration of Congress.-, The affairs of the District, as shown by the report of the Com missioners, aiein a Very satisfactory condi tion. - - - -" - , In my annual messages heretofore, and In my special message of December 19, 1879 I have urged upon the attention of Comires the necessity of reclaiming the marshes o' the Potomac adjacent to the capital, and I ate constrained by its importance Ut advert guii to the subject. These flats embrace an area ol several hundred acres. They are an impi-di-nient to the drainaue of the city, and serious ly impair its health. It is believed that, with tills substantial improvement of its river front, the capital would be in all respects one of the most attractive cities in the world. Aside Iroin its permanent population, this city is necessarily the place of residence of pe-rsons from every section of tlie; country, engaged in tlie public-service. Many others reside bet e teuiorarilv, for the transaction ol business with the Government. . 1 commend . again to the atten tion of Congress tbe sulije-t of the removal, from their present location, of the depot rt the several railroads entering the city ; and I renew the recoumiendations of my former m-ss ges in bchaif e-f tho erection of a build in; toi the Con re-sioiial Library; the eom o.ction of the Washington Monument; and of l:icral appre-p. mtions iu wtppni of ' tne is-nevuleiit, refot niutoiy and penal institu tions ol llie Di t ict.
