Questions Demar STRONG "ON RATE REGULATION The Country is Enjoying a Season of Unprecedented Prosperity?Subje<T fhat Will Engage the Atten- 1 tion of the People's Representatives?A Thoughtful and Exhaustive Document. 5 Following is in substance the annual message of President Roosevelt, as read in both houses of Congress: Introduction. I To the Senate and House of Representatives : jfrr ? v The people of this country continue ^ to enjoy great prosperity. Undouhtedlv there will be ebb aud flow in W ^sueh prosperity, and this ebb and flow ' will be felt more or less by all meni n a!1 4lio AAtnmnnilv lmth Kv the i f ' * ? ,U^J9 VI iUV Wiuuiviio^^ f wv... ^ . deserving and the undeserving. K Against tho wrath of the Lord the wisdom of man can not avail: in times of flood or drought human ingenuity I can but partially repair tire disasterA general failure of crops would hurt B 'i/os. Again, if the folly of man mars the general well-beiug, then those who * are innocent of the folly will have to ? % pay part of the penalty incurred by v; those who are guilty of the folly. A " panic brought on by the speculative ? folly of part of the business commuuiiy would hurt the whole business eommmptv. But such stoppage of . welfare, though it might be severe, k? ' would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the per5#?<icnt prosperity of the country is v the high individual character of the I average American worker, the aver^ age American citizeD. no matter 'whether his work fie mental or man Bill ual, whether he Be fanuer or wagejMh worker, business man or professional Hr nan. In our industrial and social system f\t ^.the interests of all meu are so closely ' intertwii;ed that in the immense majoHty of eases a straight-dealing man ?. v who by his efficiency, by his ingenuity and industry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the man : * of great productive capioity who beeoaaes rich by guiding the labor of ^ many other men does so by enabling ^ , them to produce more than they could ^ ^ -TirQdiifeo without his guidance; and W~~. both he'and they share in the bcuclit. which comes al>o t<? the public at - , large. The superficial fact that the ' sharing may be unequal must never - ? 1 i?. 1 il x Mind us to tne underlying iaci mai there is this sharing, and that the benefit runes in some degress to each man I concerned. Normally the wage-work. . er, the man of small means, and the 1 [Z+ average consumer, as well as the average producer, are all alike helped , bv making conditions such that the , man of exceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for his , ability. Something can be done by leg- j islation to help the general prosjierity; but no such help of a perman-1 ently beneficial character can be given j to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of a policy which shall inure to the advantage of ail industrious and efficient people who act; . . decently; and this is only another t ? way of saying that any benefit which ^ comes to the less able and less for. , tunat^e- muSt of necessity come even more to the more able and more fortunate. If, therefore, the less f?ri ? tunate man is moved by envy of his I more fortunate brother to strike at the | (conditions under which they have both, though unequally, prospered, the I rc^plt will assuredly be that while damage may come to the one struck at it will visit with an even heavier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole we must all go up or go down together. Corporations. Yet, while not merely admitting, but ' insisting upon this, it is also true that ! wuric Micro is uv ri iiuicmai icstraint or supervision some of the exceptional men use their energies not _r in ways that are for the common r . good, but in ways which tell against this common good. The fortunes amassed through corporate organiza-. tion are now so large, and vest such j power in those that wield them, as j to make it a matter of necessity to { , give to the sovereign?that is, to the Government, which represents the people as a whole?some effective Dower of suDervision over their cor porate use. In order to insure a healthy social and industrial life, every big: corporation should be held respon, sible by, and be accountable to, somo sovereign strong enough to control its conduct. I am in no sense hostile to corporations. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combination will be not only useless, but in the end vicious, because of the > 1 ?

We should, moreover, recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by corporate agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidelity devoted to their service, and therefore normally to the service of the public, by thefr officers and directors. The corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union has come to stay. Each can do and has done great good. Each should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice. So long as the finances of the Nation are kept upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which the Congress has the power to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of endeavoring to secure proper industrial conditions under which the individuals?and especially the great corporat ions?doing an interstate business are to act. The makers of our National Constitution provided especially that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of the General Government. Tli^ argument.^ in favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are far stronger to-day. in view of the enormous development of great business agencies, usually corporate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to pet any adequate regulation and supervision of these pre at corporations by State action. Such regulation and supervision can only be effectively exereised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is coextensive with the field of work of the corporations?that is, by the National Government. I am well aware of the difficulties of the legislation that I am suggesting, and of the need of temperate and cautious action in securing it. I should emphatically protest against improperly radical or hasty action. .The first thing to do is to deal with the great corporations engaged in the business of interstate transportation. As 1 said in my Message of December G last, the immediate and most pressing need, so far as legislation is concerned, is the enactment into law of some scheme to secure to the agents of the Government such supervision and regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country engaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a complete stop to rebates in every sha|)c and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with modi ncation, caution and self-restraint; but it should exist, so that it can be effectively exeeised when the need t rises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by the Congress. Illegal transactions often occur under the forms of law. It has often occurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after it has been bought an open reduction is made in rate take effect immediately, the arangement resulting to the damage of all their competitors; for it must not be forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad in the matter of rebate*. The law should make it clear so tliut nobody can fail to understand that any kind of commission paid on freight shipments, whether in this form or in the form of lictitious damages, or of a concession a frcss pass, reduced passenger rate, or payment of brokerage, is illegal. All private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commission or some similar body so far as rates, and agreements practically affecting rates, are concerned. The private-ear owners and the owners of industrial railroads are entitled to a fair and reasonable compensation on their investment, but neither private cars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, or in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. No lower rate should'apply on poods imported than actually obtains on domestic yroods from the American seaboard to destination except in cities where water competition is the controlling influence. There should be publicity of the accounts of commou carriers; no common carrier enpaped in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or reputation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the inspection of the Government. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of examination of railroad accounts should be provided similar to that now conducted into the national News Notes. Governor-elect Swanson, it is stated has decided to reappoint Labor Commissioned Doherty. Russian military oflieers say that not one of the line regiments is to be trusted. lu opening the German Reichstag Emperor William spoke of internal dangers, the restoration ot peace in the Far East and the Morroccau irabrofho. banks by the bank examiners; a few first-class railroad accountants, if they had proper direction and proper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much in preventing willful violations of the law. I I urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious action by the Interstate Commerce Commission in all these matters, whether in regulating rates for transportation or for storing or handling property or commodities in transit. The history of the cases litigated under the present commerce act shows that its efMcaeav has been to a great degree destroyed by the weapon of delay, almost the most formidable weapon in the hands of those whose purpose it is to violate the law. Safety Appilances. In my annual Message to the Fiftyeighth Congress, at its third session I called attention to the necessity for legislation requiring the use of block signals upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce. The number of serious collisions ui>on unblocked roads that have occurred within the past year adds force to the recommendation then made. The Congress should provide, by appropriate legislation, for the introduction of block signals upon all railroads engaged in interstate commerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of increased safety to the traveling public. Hours of Labor of Railroad Employees. The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employees in train service are in many cases subjected is also a matter which may well engage the serious attention of the Congress. The strain, both mental and physical, upon those who arc engaged in the movement and operation of railroad trains under modern conditions is perhaps greater than that which exists in any other industry, and if there are any reasons for limiting by law the hours of labor in any employment, they certainly apply with peculiar force to the employment of those upon whose vigilance and alertness in the performance of their duties the safety of all who travel by rail depends. Labor. The National Government has as a rule but little occasion to deal with the formidable group of problems connected more or less directly with what is known as the labor question, for in the great majority of cases these problems must be dealt with by the State and municipal authorities and not by the National Government. The National Government has con ?v?l tl?A riwti'i/W r\(* ^'AlnmKio ln,\r? ever, and it should see to it that the City of Washington is made a model eitv in all respects, both as regards parks, public grounds, proper regulation of the system of housing so as to do away with the evils of alley tenements, a proper system of education. a proper system of dealing with truancy and juvenile offenders, a proper handling of the charitable work of the District. Moreover, there should be proper factory laws to prevent all abuses in the employment ot women and children in the District. These will be useful chiefly as object lessons, but even this limited amount of usefulness would be of real national value. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issue in junctions in labor disputes. Such special limitation of 1 he equity powers of our courts would be most unwise. It is true that some judges have misused this power; but this does not justify a denial of the powei any more than an improper exercise of the {lower to call a strike by r labor leader would justify the denial of the right to strike. The Department of Commerce and Lal?or should also make a thorough investigation of the condition ol women in industry. Over five million American women are now engaged in gainful occupations; ye I there is an almost complete deartl: of data upon which to base any trust worthy conclusions as regards a sub ject as important as it is vast anc complicated There is need of ful knowledge on which to base actior looking toward State and municipa legislation for the protection or work ing women. The introduction of wo men into industry is working ehang< and disturbance in the domestic am social life of the Nation. Insurance. The great insurance companies af ford striking examples of corpora tions whose business has extended s< far beyond the jurisdiction of th< State which created them as to pre elude strict enforcement of supervi sion and regulation by the paren States. In my last annual Message I recommended "that the Congress carefully consider whether the pow .. rtl' 4 1> .1 D-I HArt 11 y-v C Mrvy\ MM 4 AA . t'l U1 IMC UUICtlU UL WipiUlIUII> V*U! not constitutionally be extended t< cover interstate transactions in in surance." Recent events have em phasized the importance of an earl; and exhaustive consideration of thi: question, to see whether it is not pos sible to furnish betier safeguards thai ' the several States have been able t< furnish against corruption of tin flagrant kind which has been exposed It has been only too clearly showi that certain of the men at the hea< of these large corporations take bu small note of the ethical distinctioi between honesty and dishonesty; the; draw the line only this side of wha mav he called law-honesty, the kint of iionestv necessary in order to avoi< | falling into the clutches of the law I By Wire and Cable. Ex-Captain Carter testified a Chicago that hehad saved the Gevern ment large sums of money on certaii contracts. Witnesses told in court the grew some story of how Suasanua A. Gcarv the suitcase victim, died under a crim . inal operation and how her body wa disposed of. Mrs. Mary B. Worthington, o South Norfolk, was burned to deat; by a bursting lamp. i 9 1 ' { " the only complete Remedy fo^^H^ondition must be f rand in an aroused public conscience, a higher sense of ethical conduct in the community at largo, and especially among business men and in the great profession of the law, and in the gro\*th of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether in rich man or in poor man, whether it takes the shape ot' bribery or of blackmail. But much can be done by legislation which is not only drastic but practical. The Revenues. There is more need of stability than of the atempt to attain an ideal perfection in the methods of raising revenue; and the shock and strain to the business world certain to attend any serious change in these methods render such change inadvisable unless for grave reason. It is not possible to lav down anv ercneral rule by which to determine tlie moment when the reasons for will outweigh those against such a change. Much must depend, not merely on the needs, but on the desires, of the people as a whole; for needs and desires are not necessarily identical. Of course no change can be made on lines beneficial to, or desired by, one section or one State only. There must be something like a general agreement among the citizens of the several States, as represented in the Congress, that the change is needed and desired in the interest of the people as a whole; and there should thena be a sincere, intelligent, and disin crested effort to make it in such sit. pe as will combine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the people at large with the minimum of necessary di regard for the special interests of localities or classes. But in time of peace tile revenue must on the average, taking a series of years together. equal the expenditures or else^ the revenues must be increased. Last year there was a deficit. Unless our expenditures can be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be readjusted. Economy in Exepnditurea. I earnestly recommend to the Congress the need of economy and to this end of a rigid scrutiny of appropriations. As examples merely, I call your attention to one of two'specific matters. All unnecessary offices should be abolished. The Commissioner of the General Land Office recommends the abolishment of the oflice of receiver of public moneys for United States land offices. Yet, in speaking of economy, I must in no wise be understood as advocating the false economy which is in the end the worst extravagance. To cut down on the Navy, for instance, would lip n nrimo nvniiKt +10 Vfifinn To fail to push forward all work on the I'anama Canal would be as great a folly. At various times I have instituted ; investigations into the organization and conduct of the business of the Executive Departments. While none of these inquiries have yet progressed far enough to warrant final conclusions. they have already confirmed , and emphasized the general imression that the organization of the I)e partments is often faulty in principle and wasteful in results, while many of their business methods are [ artiquidnted and inefficient. There I is every reason why our executive governmental machinery should bo at . least as well planned, economical, and . efficient as the best machinery of the , great business organizations, which . at present is not the case. Monroe Doctrine. s One of the most. effective instru mcnts for peace is the Monroe Doc' trine as it has been and is boinsr crad 1 ually developed by this Nation and ' accepted by other nations. No other policy could- have been as efficient I in promoting peace in the Western Hemisphere and in giving to each na^ tion thereon the chance to develop ; along its own lines. It' we had refused ' to apply the Doctrine to changing t conditions it would now be coraplete1 ly outworn, would not meet any of the needs of the present day, and indeed " would probably by this t;me hTTve ' sunk into complete oblivion. It is ' useful at home, and is meeting with 1 recognition abroad because we have 1 adapted our application of it to meet " the growing and changing needs of " our Hemisphere. When we announce J a policy, such as the Monroe Doel trine, we thereby <*ommit ourselves to the consequences of the policy, and those consequences from time to time alter. It is out of the question to - claim a right and yet shirk the re cnnncihilitv for its crcrcisp. Wit nn. i v ? -"7? ^ ) ly we, but all American Republics ?' who are benefitted by the existence . of the Doctrine, must recognize the . obligations each nation is under as t regards foreign peoples no less than its duty to insist upon its own rights'. s That our rights and interests are - deeply concerned in the maintenance ! of the Doctrine is as clear as hardly :> to need argument. This is especially . true in viev. of die construction of . the Panama Canal. As a mere mater , of self-defense we must exercise a s close watch over the approaches to .'this canal; and this means that we i I must be thoroughly alive to our inter> ests in the Caribbean Sea. hifiiswor arsea iMd'es Ezrh hrdluu ' Santo Domingo. 1 Santo Domingo, in her turn, has t now made an appeal to its to help 1 her. and not only every principle of r wisdom but every generous instinct t within us bids us "respond vo the ap1. peal.

Monroe Doctrine, or because "we re^ gaid the ca9e of Santo Domingo ds/ standing wholly by itself, and to be treated as auch, and not on general principles or with any reference to the Monroe Doctrine. Army and Nary. We cannot consider the question of our foreign policy without at the same time treating of the Array and the Navy. We now have a very small army?indeed, one well-nigh infinitesimal when compared with the army of any other large nation. Of course the Army we do have should be as nearly perfect of its kind and for its size as possible. I do not believe that any army in the world has a better average of enlisted man or a better type of junior officer; but the Army should be trained to act effectively in a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind so that the troops may learn how to take care of themselves under actual service conditions; every march for instance, being made with the soldier loaded exactly as lie would be in active campaign. The generals and colonels would thereby have opitortunity of handling regiments, brigades, and divisions, and the comniisary and medical departments would be tested in the field. Provision should be made for the exercise at least of a brigade and by preefrencc of a division in marching and embarking at some point and continuing its march. The number of posts in which the Army is kept in time of peace should be matrially diminshed and the posts that are left made correspondingly larger. No local interests should be allowed to stand in th?? way of assembling the greater part of the troops which would at need form our tield armies in stations of such size as will permit the best training to be given to the personnel of all grades, including the high officers and staff officers. To accomplish this end we must have not company or regimental garrisons^ btu brigade and division garrisons. Federal Elections. The President touches upon the question of Federal elections, quoting the well known con&itutional provision that .Congress shall be the tinal judge of the qualification of its own members. He also declares strongly against all forms of corruption and expresses regret at the growing tendency to increase expenses in connection with the conduct of political campaigns. Briefly, he advocates the greatest -possible purity of the ballot and the fulest freedom of the exercise of the elective franchise consistent with good government. Immigration. Thes ubjeet of immigration is treated by Mr. Roosevelt in a particularly able and thoughtful manner. The tendency of foreigners to congregate in sections of the country already congested with people is deplored. High-class foreigners are desirable and are welcomed, but only those with tendencies towards good citizenship and of industrious and law-abiding habits will add to the general welfare of the nation. It is pointed out that our farming sections need labor, and that all who, come with a will to work will find a ready welcome. Criminal Laws. In my last Message I asked the attention of the Congress to the urgent need of action to make our criminal law more effective; and I most earnestly request that you pay heed to the report of the Aattorney Uetierar on tnis suojecr. leniurics ago it was especially needful to throw even* safeguard round the accused. Such danger then was lest he should be wronged by the state. The danger is now exactly the reverse. Breaches of Trust in Public Service. There seems to be no statute of the United States which provides for the punishment of a United States attorney or other officer of the Government who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully refrain from doing any act when the consideration for such corrupt agreement is other than one possessing money value. This ought to be remedied by appropriate legislation. Public Land Laws. Once again I call your attention to . the condition of the public-land laws. 

IXI'ITIH UC* tiupuicuio 11 a ? c yen uvn urgency to the need for such changes as will fit these laws to actual present conditions. The'honest disposal and right u; t of the remaining public lands is e fundamental importance. The in.quitous methods by which the monopolizing of the public lands is being brought about under the present laws are becoming move generally known, but the existing laws do not furnish effective remedies. rlhc recommendations of the Public Lands Commission upon this subject are wise and should be given effect. The Jamestown Tercentennial. This enterprise is highly commendI id by the President, who heartily sets ?ihc seal of his approval upon everything Congress may see fit to do to assist in making it a success. Onr Island Possessions. Good work has been done by our government in all the territorial acquired by our recent war with Spain. Order is rapidly being brough alxmt and the people are becoming contented and prosperous. . 1 McCurdy Resigns Mi 'ual. New York, Special.?Kit >ard A. McCurdy resigned as preside t of the Mutual Life * Insurance C /mpany. Ilis resignation was accepter by the board of trustees, and Frederick Cromwell, treasurer of the Mutual, was named as his temporary successor. While no definite announcementwas made regarding the selection of a permanent successor for Mr. Mc1 Curdy, it was persistently reported that the presidency of the company had b^n offered to James H.

The President recommends to the Congress the enlargement of the bounds of the Yellowstone National Park, the protection of the Niagara Falls and the establishment of such other park reservations as congress , may see fit to set apart. The great ( benefits of these national parks to j science as well as to the health and ( happiness of the people is pointed j out. ( Merchant Marine.

It can not but be a source of regret and un- { easiness to us that the lines of commmiicaticn with out sister republics i f South America should he chie;'y under foreign control. Pensions. < The soldier who did his duty in i the time of war "should receive the benefits of a grateful country, but , here as elsewhere, a strict watch , should be kept to prevent fraud. Mississippi Levees. i The National Government already , does something in connection with j the construction and maintenance of the great system of levees along the lower course of the Mississippi; in iny judgment it should do much more. The Civil Service. The civil service law has been on the statute books for twenty-two years. Every President and a vast majority of heads of departments 1 fvho have been in office during that | period have favored a gradual extension of the merit system. The * more thoroughly its principles have been understood, the greater has been the favor with which the law has hem legarded by administrative of- ( officers. Any attempt to carry on the great executive departments of the , Government without this law wouid ] inevitably result in chaos. The Civil i Service Commissioners arc doing excellent work; and their compcnsa- . tion is inadequate considering the service they perform. Admission to Statehood. I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be adiintted as one ; State and that Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one State. There is no obligation upon us to treat territorial subdivisions, which are matters of convenience only, as binding us on the question of admission to statehood. Panama Canal. The treatment between the United States and the Republic of Panama, under which the construction of the Panama Canal was made possible, went into effect with its ratification by the United States on April 23, ! 1904. on payment of $40,000,000 to that company. On April 1, 1905, the Commission was reorganized and it now consists of Theodore P. Shonts, chairman, Charles E. MaAdmiral Mordecai T. Endicott, Brig. Gen. Peter C. Hains, and Col. Oswald j H. Ernst. - The Department of State. t m/iammmd mnrp adenuate Dro X IVWUiUivnu 1 * vision than has been made heretofore for the work of the Department of State. Within a few years there has been a very great increase in the amount and importance of the work to be done by that Department, both in *\Vashington and abroad. This has been caused by the great increase of our foreign trade, the in-, crease of wealth among our people, which enables them to travel more generally than heretofore, the increase of American capital which is seeking investment in foreign countries, and the growth of Our power and weight m the councils of the civilized world. Conclusion.. t Suitable provision should be madf for the expense of keeping our diplomatic officers more fully informed of what is being done from day to day in progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries. The lack of such information, caused by UlSUIIlcieni appropriations atauomc for cable tolls and for clerical and mesenger service, frequently puts our ollicers at a great disadvantage and detracts from their usefulness. The salary list should be readjusted. It does not now correspond either to the importance of the service to be rendered and the degrees of ability and experience required in the different positions, or to the differences in the cost of living. In many cases the salaries are quite inadequate.
