TELEGRAPHIC WSE T Dayis 6r ws Gravely Eloquent Washington 6In the Senate to day when Edmunds called up his reso lution providing for the continuance of t the committees as they existed at the < close of the last session President pro tern Davis who temporarily occupied his former seat on the floor having vacated the chair to Harris said Mr President The solemn event which excited the sympathy of the civil ized world recently brought about the unexpected change in the presidency The Fortyseventh Congress now meets under tke constitutional successor to the President who was only inaugurated laal March and who was stricken down in the maturity of his manhood after but four short months experience in the ex ecutive chair Those stern facts are full of admonition They teach us how frail are human hope and how transitory is i human power In the presence of this sad instruction ambitk may well pause and all of us IE ay learn how vain are the aspirations to which too much of our 1 lives is devoted Great as was the be i reavement which spread sorrow over the land rend which touched the heart of every fireside it was sanctified by the consolation that the people of aU sections were brought nearer together by common grief end thus came to understand each otber better Through the kindred emo I tions that had long existed they were softened and the violence of faction was I chastened by ffiiclion Although Pres ident Arthur represents the party that I elected Garfield his personal position i is necessarily delicate and u icg He is I entitled by his whole bearing thrcugh the critical ordeal to generous countenance As a Senator I propose to extend to his administration candid treatment sus I taining it when right and opposing It when wrong on all public questions I Bolding to this purpose and intending to insist OH a pure economy and just ad I ministration of the executive trust The new President ought to bo aided by all proper legislative cooperation in carry ing out the general policy he may pro pose to the country Whatever that policy in future my be it is entitled to a fair trial and patient hearing With this view of my duty I shall vote wil lingly to continue the committees in this body az they are now con stituted It is best that the party which has the President and House of Representatives should be held answer able for all public measures Then there will be no divided responsibility If the opposition are wise they will accept this conclusion At a special session in March they made but a brief and feeble I stand against the organization of the committees which shape the great legis lation of the country Indeed they al most conceded that important point to their adversaries but in the protracttd contest for offices of the Senate under the same political conditions my demo cratic friends yiel cd nQ ground from I the beginning to the end of it Doubt less they had satisfactory reasons for this course of policy Last spring I took oc i casion to state the reasons why my vote should be given for the then existin organizaticn of the Senate Although circumstances have materially changed since that time the position which I voluntarily assumed has not been altered hence I adhere to that declaration always reserving to myself the right of rejecting offensive candidates I am greatly encouraged in this decision by the course of my distinguished friend from Vermont eminent as a leader of his party as he is also eminent for public and private worth upon his motion the present chief clerk distinctly appointed as a democrat was unani mously made acting secretary That graceful deed is a cheering sign which affords me pleasure applause because this is the first place where an example should be set against the common scram I bling for office that disfigures our politi cal life The country was almost equally divided between the two great partiee at the presidential election The majority in the House of Representatives is small i and in this chamber republicans and democrats confront each other with like numbers The committees are now held by the other party From my standpoint it would be unwise to disturb this cot di i tion of things and I do not propose to engage in any struggle that looks to that object As our parties are organized the public man who steps outside party lines I is always exposed to Harsh criticism no matter how proper his motives may be The machinery both enforces rigid dis cipline and denounces revolt as treason 1 For the last ten years my political posi l tion has been entirely independent of any organization I have accepted good wher ever it was found and I have voted for the beet men whether they were called re i publicans or democrats Consistency is not a virtue if it means dogmatic adhe sion to a given idea when change would be meritorious Toe greatest statesmen of modern times have been courageously inconsistent and have become public benefactors by abandoning mistaken pol icy If conviction satisfied me that opin ions formed long ngo and followed since then were erroneous it would not cost me a moments thought to cast them off like a a worn out garment I believe them to be sound and so believing I shall stand by them as moderator between ex tremes It pleases the majority of the Senate to confer upon me the highest distinction in their gift Prized as tint honor is and ought to be it is doubly val uable in my estimation because it come wholly unsought and without the ex change of a single w rd directly or ind rectly that could by possibility imp u an obligation This is the only answer I I shAll ever makp to the unworthy mu ds that would maaatire the integrity CJ t others by their tW1 iw BUnda1 of per tonal honor The day is drawing near 1 when I shall ratire from this chamber My only ambition while here IP to be instrumental in bringing about perfect peace between the north and south as the best means for promoting the permanent prosperity of the whole union When rude voices of faction which for fifteen I years past in time of peace have dis turbed national fellowship that should have been restored at the close ef the civil war shall be silenced this ceuntry will bound forward in a career of grandeur and glory that will astound mankind Reconciliation has nobler aims than mere national wealth If this experiment of republican government Is to endure and to be per petuated as we all humbly pray God it nay be for unborn generations then the spirit of forbearance and of toleration in which it Was created by patriotic of our father must be revived and imitated In no other way can a mora perfect union which their inspired wisdom formed out of the disjointed confedera tion be preserved u a shining ht of higktr cirilizatioiL ui u a refuge for ke orNHd er all lands I When referring to his acceptance of the I I position of President of the Senate Davis I manifested considerable indignation in alluding to the various newspaper in sinuations that he had sold himself the republicans He was very emphatic in reasserting that not a single word tending to commit himself to the republicans had passed between him and them
