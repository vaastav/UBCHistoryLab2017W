Trains on the Waterbury and Meri den railroad began running again to day, after a stop of several years. This will ba good news for Meriden, as the inhabitants of fchat isolated town will now be connected with hustling Waterbury and its large sub urban population. The management should remember the original stock holders by sending them a mileage book over the road. The investment they made would then seem as though it was bearing some fruit A Washington correspondent -thus discusses the president's message, be fore the rest of us 'have had a chance to get a glimpse at it: "There is Uttle or nothing in Mr McKinley's an nual -message to congress, long as the document is, -that Indicates with any OI "certainty, what policy he in tends to follow towards the Philip pines. This indicates that he has not decided upon a policy, or f he has, that -he is afraid to make it public yet. and confirms the heHrif tnmn that lie intends playing foxey on the Philippine question until atfter -he gets tiat) treaty of pea, ratified by the senate and the 120,000,000 whici we are to pay Spain, appropriated by con gress. An announcement of a positive policy . before then might result In making too many votes against both treaty and appropriation. Mr Mc Kinley's handling of the war and mat ters relating thereto, in his imessajge, contained no surprises. The message follows Just about the lines It iwas ex pected to follow lines plainly indi cated for wee'ks, aye months, past, by official and semi-official emanations from the administration. The mes sage also indicates very olalnlv that Mr McKiniey isn't as anxious to push along financial legislation as some of the members of his party would like him to be." Senator Caffrey of (Louisiana savs be will oppose the ratification by the senate of ai treatv uineTiwr Philippine Islands, but mpon one con dition would gladly support it-tbat all the negroes be deported to those islands and never be allowed to return to the United States. Mr Caffrey said: "If the south could Ibe rid of the negro problem, it -would prosper beyond the dream of man. "With its great natural advantages of climate and of soil, with its coal and iron hidden away in its mountains and the vast inducements for capital wbieh it would offer, if the negro problem was settled, it would take a great stride forward." Another senator iwho will oppose the Philip pine annexation Is Senator Hale, who makes it plain by his talk that -he in tends to join Senator Hoar in oppos ing the ratification of the treaty of peace, because It provides for United States ownership of the Philippines. Whether there are other republicans wbo will oppose tOie treaty is not pos itively known, but, unless there have been some recent changes, tjhere are a sufficient number of democrats who will oppose it, to make it almost cer tain that no attempt will be made to bring -the treaty to a vote during the life of this congress. After March 4 it is expected that the required two- thirds vote can be controlled in the senate, whicb. can be called in extra session for the express purpose of dis posing of be treaty, 'without calling an extra session of the bouse, II Mr McKinley so willa it. 

HEARD IN PASSING. Mr McKinley will not lessen bis troubles by trying to have one tariff policy for the Philippines and another for Porto Rico. A correspondent says Ohauncey De pew's unusual Gilenco shows how obedient he will be to Boss Piatt when he gets in. the senate. No, that pale hectic bump on the back of the average New England citi zen does not indicate devotion to the bicycle babit. It merely signifies that his front sMewalk is clear of snow. Pawtucket Times. The safe that was taken from the raised Spanish cruiser Maria Teresa, and which was not opened till yester day, was found stuffed full of bags of gold and silver coins. It Is estimated that the value is $75,000. The amount might be sent to Spain when we pay her $20,000,000 (for the Philippines. It would be real generous-like. Hart ford Times.

The other is the appointment of Andrew Turnbull to the position of county corn'missioner. If we can judge by past experience, the country towns will say that New Britain wants too much and then gives us nothing. New Britain Independent. Quite a number of years ago, Con necticut was taken from the republi can and placed in the democratic col umn, as the result of a senatorial con test. Democrats united witb bolting republicans and elected Hon O. S. Ferry. The result was a republican breach which lasted a decade or more. PerV.rrs history may furnish a profit able guide for democratic action in the present senatorial contest. Bridgeport Farmer. 

COUNTRY JUSTICE. "Worst set-back I ever had," tells an attorney who does a fine business on Griswold street, "was years ago to the western part of the state, shortly after I had been admitted to the bar. It was my first civil case, my former ex perience having been confined ito the field of asault and battery. One fariner was claiming $200 damages as the re sult of a deal he had with a neighbor and I 'Was for the defendant "The presiding justice of the peace was new to his position, but bad all the confidence of a book agent, and considered himself a final arbitrator in all disputes submitted to him. I had a strong case and, having studied it days and nights for weeks, never overlooked a point. The justice, It seemed to me, did not fairly appre ciate the importance of the issue and he was constantly urging us to hustle things along for be was going over into Illinois to spend the holidays with a brother of his. "Justice squirmed in hi3 hard-bottomed chair while my opponent' made one of those noisy harangues tha t were the proper thing in those days. With a pile of books alt my elbow, I began on a long and flowery speech which had been rehearsed several hundred times. I was just well under way with the Impressive introduction when jus tice called a halt. " 'I hain't got no time to hear all this here elerquenoe,' he stated in cold blood. 'I leave fur Illinoise in the morr-in',' and have a lot a runnin 'round ter do. I d-rawed up this here verdict fur the plaintiff last night so's ter save time. Constable, when Jim mie gits through epoutim', lock up and leave the key over to Jake Smith's.' " Detroit Free Press.
