Tin: Commissioner of Internal Revenue in his annual report shows that the government can raise suffi cient revenue without the tax on bank-chock, matches patent medi cines, bank deposits and bank capi tal, and he recommends the repeal of the tax collected from these sources.

The taxes promised to be aholihed on the alKiyc articles amounts to $11,000,000 jht annum, and the fact that the burdens of the peoj Je can be light ened this much, shows not only the prosjxrous condition of the country, but the natural fruits of the souud Republican administration " f the National finances;. .

We lay liefore our readers in this issue the last annual Message of President Hayes. It is very long, but it will well repay perusal, and in its general scope and exhibit of the a flairs of the Nation will doubt less prove eminently satisfactory. Publishing as we do almost the en tire text of it, extended comment is uncalled for. Each reader can and will make up his own judgment, and we doubt not that judgment w ill be most favorable to its author. To all sve most heartily commend it. It is reported from Washington that some of the leading Democrats in the House are dickering with the Oreenbackers with a view of captur ing the organization of the next House. It is said they offer to sup port a Greenback Congressman Mr. Padd of Maine for Speaker. It can not be done, and the proposition only shows to what a depth the Democratic party has fallen, when its leaders propose to make it the tail of a half dozen Greenhackers. Congressm an IIckd of Ohio, who is an out-and out Democratic free trader, and belieses in the doctrine of "a tariff for revenue only," has introduced a series of resolutions in the House denouncing our present protective system, and is mercilessly whipping his Democratic colleagues into line against protection. With Watterson of the Louisville Courier Journ,d and other Bourbon Demo crats, he believes that true Dem ocracy means free trade, and is de termined to make his party toe the mark. Mr. Speaker llandall and other professed protectionists in the party, will have to do some tall dodging and squirming in their at tempts to serve two masters. The result of the late flections is not very encouraging to Northern Dem- oceats who ha-c the wit to under stand the drift of public sentiment, on the question of protection to home industry. The electoral college of Georgia assembled last week, and of course cast the vote of the State for Han cock and English. As the law S3ys the electors shall assemble and vote on the first Wednesday of Deccm lr, they cannot therefore legally vote on any other day, and having failed to vote on the day fixed by lasv, their subsequent action amounts to nothing, and the vote of the Stite is lost. As well might Somerset County have refused to observe the Stite law, and held her election on the Third Tuesday of November, and then demanded that her vote be counted. Georgia having clearly for feited her right to have her vote count ed, we insist that there is no posver existing anywhere that can now authorize or legalize its being count ed. To cour.t it is to violate a plain provision both of the Constitution and of the law, and it is no excuse to say that this thing has been done before, or that it can make no differ ence as to the general result. To do so is not only adding strength to a bad precedent, but is a most fla grant violation of the law that can not be justified, and we trust that no sentimentalism will induce Re publicans to countenance the effort that will le made in that direction Those who thought that the re sult of the late election had taught the Democrats a lesson were badly mistaken. Your regular Bourbon Democrat is as thoroughly incapa ble of learning anything new, an is an old dog of being taught new tricks. Inste-ad of the present short session of Congress being strictly devoted to the transaction of necessary busi ness as was hoped by the country, the Demexrats have forced a pro tracted debate, which has already wastctl three days, over a proposed new rule for counting the electoral vote. If there was any dispute like ly to arise os-er the counting of the the vote cast last month, 'there might be a necessity for speed ily adjusting the manner of the --j- s - - nt, but as the election of the Re- dican candidates is admitted cou publ without the slightest cavil, and four years must elapse before the ques tion can again arise, it might well and me t properly be deferred to a more fitting season. The time hon ored custom from the organization of the government to the election of Mr. Lincoln, was for the two House to meet in joint convention, each House h -letting a teller who summ-1 eel up ami delivered the result to the! Vice President, whe. thereupon do-' dared it to the nwmhleel Consw." Now the Democrat want to in-' troduce a now method of deehmni:: but to Bay the least tlie introduc- tionof it at this time when no dia-1 piste h to-the result" of the late elec- tion is made, and the attempt to force it through under the gap of the ' previous question, looks more than ; cou..an. m tne i.g u sue . . . . . t I :uempi ol me jienioerane nanv 10 , ionrrv t he two last l'resi.Jentia dec- . , ilP;iu.rv- fr ld f.,r... rv md perjury, the Republicans naturally j fearing that some trick is intended, j steadily resist the change.
