Next Tuesday is the day set for South Carolina to meet in convention to consid er thu matter—of course no other consid eration than secession will be allowed in the convention. Magrath, Miles, Rhett and Spratt, all loud secessionists have been elected to the convention from their respective districts. A bill was submit ted to the Legislature on Thursday pro viding for public hollidays. It omits the Fourth of July, It seems that they do uot care to remember the days of Sump ter, Marion, Ilayne, Ac. Liberty is not to their taste —tliey prefer treason and anarchy. Itsjr Congress convened a week ago hist Monday, ar.d went immedietely to work earnestly aud, in the lluuse, practi cally. The homestead Bill was called up by Mr. Grow, so amended as to avoid the objections made by the President in his veto message of the last session, and was passed by the handsome vote of 132 toTti. The Pension Bill, together with the Military Academy Bill, was also passed. Thus three important measures are pass ed in the House in the middle of the first week's session, and the President's Mes sage was read the second day instead of the thiid week of the session. This dis patch of business argues well for the en ergy of the Republican members. A committee was appointed to consid er the state of the Nation. We -ive the © names elsewhere. It wiil not amount to any given sum, as far a we can judge. The Southern StlusU'r. The slave holders have ruled the na tion so long—have had their hands so uninterruptedly deep down into the na tional Treasury, filling all the important offices with their adherents; that tliev are enraged at the prospect of being dis missed from the fat places heretofore held by them The Union being no longer under their control they threaten to destroy it, and their allies in the North, knowing that their rule is ended, unless the Republi cans can be frightened ir.to makii g con cessions to the Have power, are busv magnifying the dangers likely to befal our glorious Union If any considerable number of leading Republicans can It frightened into an abandonment of the!

But if our friends are friyhtcned by the treasonable threats of the slave hold ers into the slightest concession, then the i Republican party will go to pieces, t!i Slave-power will resume its control of the Government, and the opponents of slav ery will form another party and the fight will go on fiercer than ever, for there is an irrepressible conflict between Freedom and Slavery. Take no step backward in the true course for all earnest men. — We coufess to be a little uneasy at the present danger of the country. But our uneasiness is all occasioned by the feai that weak kneed republicans may cave in to the clamor of the slave holders and their allies, for a repeal of Northern Per sonal Liberty Bills, a Slave code for the Territories aud other like demands ; to aompromisc is but to commence a new fight; for anti Slavery is as certain to tri umph in the end, 3s that virtue is more onduriDg than vice. The President's .Message, i'liis important State document has oems to hand, and we have carefully read that portioQ which relates to the ail ab sorbing qucstiou of secession. Its firm position and oonei iitoiy tone and temper had been so much commented uron, as ' to incline us to look for a calm, dispas sionate and unprejudiced vindication of the rights of the States not merely, but of the stern duties of Federal authority Making duo allowance however for the trying position in which the President finds himself placed in the present crisis of national affairs, aud much as we desire' to say something for the retiring Execu tive which shall commend him in Ins last moments to the prayers and benedictions of the people, we give up in despair, and can do no better than set down this his ... last Message. i disastrous failure The | Message opens in tlie following words : " Fellow Citizens of the Senate ami ; House of liepreieiitatices: : " Throughout the year since our Inst meeting, the country lias been eminently prosperous in all its material interests. | The general health lias been excellent, our harvests have been abundant, and plenty smiles throughout the land. Our commerce and manufactures have been: prosecuted with energy and industry, and have yielded fair and ample returns. In short, no nation in the t.de of time has ever presented a spectacle of greater ma terial prosperity than we have done until within a very recent period." This glance at the benefactions of the past, is the ouiy ray of sunshine which appears throughout the weary mazes of this cheerless document. After asking a siugle question, as follows : 4i Why is it, then, that discontent now so extensively prevails, and the Union of the States, which is t lie source of all these ! blessings, is threatened with destruction?" , This questio # n ho proceeds to answer by an enumeration of all the grievances un der which the South is claimirg to suffer.' Here, again, wo cannot fail to quote from the Message, the following language : '•The long continued and intemperate interference of the Northern people with the question of Slavery i.i the Southern States lias at length produced its natural effects. The different sections of the Union arc now arrayed against each oth er, and the time has arrived, so much dreaded by the Father of his Country, when hostile geographical parties have been formed. I have long foreseen and often forewarned my countrymen of the now impending danger. This does not proceed solely from the claims on the part of Congress or the territoiial legislatures to exclude Slavery from rise Territories,' nor from the efforts of different States tc defeat the execution of the Fugitive Slave law. " Ail or any of these evils might have been endured by the South without dan ger to the Union (as others have been,) i.i the hope that tiiue and reflection might apply the remedy. The immediate peril arises not so much from these causes as from the f ct that the incessant and vio icnt agitation of the Slavery question throughout the North for the last quarter of a century, has at length produced its malign influence on the slaves and in spired them with vague notions of free dom. Hence a sense of security no long er exists around the family altar. This feeling of peace at home has given place to apprehensions of servile insurrection. Many a matron throughout the South re tires at night in dread of what may befall herself and her children before the morn ing. Should this apprehen ion of domes tic danger, whether 'vai or imaginary, extend and intensify its If until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern peo ple, then disunion will become inevitable. Self-preservation is the liist law of nature, 'and h s been implanted in the heart of man by h.s Creator for the wisest, pur pose ; and no political union, however fraught with blessings and benefits in all oth r respects, can long continue, if the necessary consequence be to render the homes and firesides of nearly half the par ties to it habitually and hopelessly inse cure. Sooner or later the bonds of such a Union mut be severed. It is my cou \iction that this fatal period has not \ct ..riived; and uiy prayer to Gud is that lie will preserve the Constitution and the | Union throughout all generations." Thus, shutting his eyes to the fact that, during the last quarter of a century, there has not oeen a day when the South and the representatives of Democ r acy could be induced to refrain from continued and persistent agitation of the question —for- getting, as ho does, that the South, led on by that great, apostle of Democracy, 

STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS, less than six years since, " settled agitation " by the repeal of the most solemn compact, (the Constitution alone excepted,) which was ever framed by the representatives of a great people—forgetting all this—lie thus throws all the responsibility of this whole question in respect to the peiila of dis union, upon the people of the Free States —especially the Republicans. Rut Mr. HUCUANAN tells us that there is no difficulty whatever in the American people settling, at once, and forever, the Slavery question, and restoring peace and harmony to a distracted country. To do this he tells us that. ***** " All that is nec essary to accomplish the object, and all | tor which the Slave States have ever con tended, is to be let alone, and permitted to manage their domestic institutions thei rown way. As sovereign States, thew and they alone, arc responsible before Gud and the world for the S a very existing among them. For this, the people of the North are not responsible, and have no more right to interfere, than with similar institutions in Russia or in Brazil. I pou their good sen*e and patiiotie forbearance I confess I still rely. Without their aid, it is beyond the power of any President, no matter what may be his own political proclivities, t• restore peace and harmony among ihe States. Wisely limited and restrained as is his power, under our Con stitution and laws, he alone can accom plish cut little, for good or for evil, on such a momentous question." Mr. 

BUCHANAN does not however half finish Is is Turssnge before he in effect gives aflat contradiction to the two essential 1 ~ , i points in tins very programme ot " tma, settlement." lie suggests the following. . c I as an explanatory ameudment of tho Con- • ■ stituticn: 1. "An express recognition of the right of propeity in slaves in toe States I where it now exists or may hereafter ex- • i.-.- . ' , 2. "The duty of protecting this right ;in all the Ten i uries throughout their tor- ( ritoiiul existence, aud until they shili bo I admitted as States into the Union, with or without Slavery, as their constitutions may prescribe." 3. "A like recognition of the right of \ . the master to have his slave, who has es- j I enped from one State to another, restored and "delivered up" to iiitn, and of the ; validity ol the Fugitive Slave law enact- J ed for this purpose, together with a dec f duration that all State laws impairing or i defeating this right a.o violations of the •.i t i t Constitution, aud are consequently null ' and void." t This programme would utterly over- t throw every vestige of the assumption , , {hat for the Slavery existing at the South, i the North is no more responsible than for J similar institutions in Russia, or Brazil, t Who does not discover at a glance, that ' such a constimti jnal recognition ol prop- t erty in Slaves as is here foreshadowed, ; would at ono3 make slave-holding every- \ where legal beneath the shadows of Fed- ; oral authority ? Who can fail to discov- < cr that such a recognition of the rights ' of slave property, would at once bind the uution to the protection of that kind of ' property, not only in every State aud Ter ritory. but equally upon the High Seas?.' But we turn away with loathing from . . , 1 a further consideration of the points in t this, Mr. BUCHANAN'S last Message.— . . p Next wec-k we will give a synopsis ot the s Message—the document is entirely too ' long for our columns, and too uniutercst- . . . ... iug to merit its entire insertion. \\ e uiav. ■ 1 .. however, conclude to publish that portion < relating to secession, in a week or two. 1 THE grand Select Committee of one Member from each State, raised by the j House to consider ihe state of the Union and report measures looking to its per pet nation and future peace, was y ester- ! day appointed by Speaker Pennington.

THE House of Ecpieseutatives showed I the right temper yesterday. No time < was wasted iti useless talk, but the real ! business of the country was begun in ] earnest. Mr. f rime's Homestead bill ica* 11 pasxcil, and will go to the Senate, whence • J: we tru,t it will promptly be laid before Utile Old Public Functionary fur him to:' t veto it, if lie dares. The bilL for the pay ment of pensions and the support of West " Point Academy were also passed. Now, 3 let the House take up and pass Mr. Mor- ' - rill's Tariff bill, and it wiil do more for I 5 the real pacification of the Republic than can be done by a million new Fugitive Slave laws.—A Y.

Y ' 1 Eoeniny Just's Washington cojrespon ! deuce says : t "The Message was playfully but quite i ; | happily hit off by Mr Seward, just af- ' 'iter the reading, when some friends of the. President asked him what he thought ' of it.
