We learn that on next Monday night Park Benjamin is engaged to read a poem on the War, before the Library "Association in Brainard'i Hall. He cannot i tail to draw a large aadieneo. J . . .Thiatxb, "FeepO' Day " continues to draw large audiences at the Academy of S Msaie. There it so much novelty In the J piece that the audience sever tires of It. It will be repeated to-nieat. ' Mist Matilda Hoghm. A more charm ing dancer never graced the boards of a Clay eland theater than Miss Matilda Haghes. She is fascinating in appearance, graceful and correct in all her movements, and her wardrobe is most elegant. She is a great favorite here and always commands an eaeor from the audience. We hear that she is to have benefit on Monday night next, and hope it will be a good one, for she de. serves it. Advkxtisk. A successful business man who has tried it, writes with regard to adver tising : " Give me the field when a few advertisers occupy it, and I care not bow hard the times may be. It pays me at all times and es pecially it pays me when most of the business men in my line have taken their hoeks cut of the water, believing nb bites are to be had." Xhe above, which we dip from an exchange, r.s is worthy of being heeded. The man who is ' ready to give np because the timei are hard is the first to stop advertising. Waits, a Ghost. The Lorain County News advertises for a "ghost." Jeal ous of the advantage! which Cleve land " local! " derive from a well authenticated ghost, who " walk! " very op portunely when items are scarce, the News wants a spectre in Oberlin. It proposes to hire one, and asks, " who'il be ghost for us at a eheap salary V Perhaps the Cleveland ghost has beard of the advertisement and gone to Oberlin to perform a brief provincial engagement. . We hav'nt heard of him here for some time. Beiso Good. A little daughter of a friend of our'a, who has not yet reached her fifth year, came to her father the other morn ing with a very serious look on her young face, and told him she had been thinkingthat she bad not always been a good girl. She had been naughty many times, she said, but she had determined to be a very good little girl in the future and mind all that her pa and ma told her. Her father expressed bis gratification that she had resolved to be good and hoped that she would cling to so worthy a resolution. " Yes," replied the little girl, " I won't be naughty any more at least not before Christmas, for Santa Claus don't bring naughty little girls anything." Human goodness is equally disinterested, Tory often. Tbx Secosd Catalbt. One Battalion of the 2d Ohio Cavalry, numbering between three and four hundred men, passed through Indianapolis on Monday, on their way to Oamp Dennison. The Indianapolis Journal says : "They stopped here some time to get nreaxiast, wait lor transportation, and look at the place, which latter duty seemi to have been performed with great relish and energy, aa sqaads of them could be seen -wandering about in all directions within a few minutes after they stopped. A portion of the regi ment which baa been serving farther soalb than this battalion, and occasionally opera- Xing In the nortbeastern corner of Aexas went to St. Louis. Those who passed through here generally looked well and strong, but quite rusty in appearance, and evidently condition to appreciate a new suitot clotnes. The Conduct of tbe Soldiers. Mb. Editor : Frequentoomplaintsappearinyour paper of the conduct of the soldiers in Camp Cleveland well founded, I presume, and yet I wish to say, aa a resident upon the Heights, very near the Camp, considering the number there, and the bad influenoes growing out the proximity of the Camp to the city, the grog-shops and dens of infamy to which they are tempted, they hare conducted themselves with unexpected propriety. The Camp is a bad place camp life terri bly corrupting men away from home, with tittle to do, go rapidly down. This is one f the evils of war. . The great evil is intemperance. The Heights furnishes more than its share of pli where these men are robbed of their money, ejf their manliness, health and morals, while the city government permits the traffic to carried on all days of the week, and every hour of the 24, and from these drinking plaees maddened men are turned out to dis tnrbthe peace, to insult and rob men upon the streets of your city. The police have little ground of complaint. If they would withdraw their patronage from these saloons; the County Proscutor, Marshal and police, all unite to enforce law against the grog shops, we should aosno sympathy for them. I would not insin uate that all the police visit these places, thai any of them visit the lowest, but I say, Cleveland's saloons, where liquors sold, are Cleveland's curse and shame, that no pains is taken by those who might do it, to eheok the evil, is a shame to those who are sworn to eaforoe the laws, i -: . A Cmsix Aim THi Diseetbiu. The Cincinnati Times . of yesterday, says : " Captain W. A. Powell, of the 124th Ohio Regi ment, has been after the deserters from that command with a vengeanoe. He left last night at tea o'clock for the quarters of the regiment at Cleveland, taking with him thir teen young men who had enlisted and after receiving their bounty money bad rued their bargain and wished to stay at home. They will, we suppose, be incorporated into a night-oap company." SorffD. " Sound in the head " is a pop ular expression now-a-dayi. Old Joe Gates being intoxicated one day, fell down stairs and fractured his. skull. Trepanning was necessary in order to save his life, and when he got well the doctor's bill was $100. Joe paid it, but it eame hard. Whenever he hears any one say "sound in the head," he growls forth, " had ought to be sound spent a hundred dollars in repairs." A Pohste. Bay Haddock, of the De troit Tribune and Advertiser, reports a case where a man named Boyl whipped another named Parr, and says the latter was Parr- Boil-ed. If Ray don't deserve thirty days under water, ne one does. He is the " worst man in the business." We are tempted to add that great depravi ty is indicated when a Boy' I whip his Par. Heatt Tax. Mr. John M. Huehes, the popular Brewer of Cleveland, paid his Federal license and tax for three months, on Tuesday, amounting to $977. This affords evidence of a very large business in the brewing line, and also proves the great popularity of Hughea' Ale." Hundreds of private families in the city consider it essential to their comfort to have a barrel of Hughes' Ale in the cellar. Dexied. We made a statement the oth er day on the authority of the members of the regiment that the 10th cavalry had been consolidated with the 8th, and ordered to join Hunter in South Carolina. The State Journal of yesterday morning denies the re port on the authority of Governor Tod. " That settles that." Bound fob Nashville. Mr. L. B.

HOUSE. 2S 15 9 of of L. is lust Mr. Bineham introduced a bill amenda tory to confiscation acts, so that in all cases pending os which may hereafter arise wherein any ship, vessel or any oth er property may be oondemned, tne court rendering judgment shall be for making award, first, to provide for the payment of any bona fido claims filed by any loyal oiiizen or friendly foreigner where proof of claim can be established. Referred to Committee on Judiciary. The House then passed Senate joint res olution instructing Committee on Conduct of the War, to report thereon with all con venient speed. Mr. tevenB, from the committee on Ways and Means, reported a bill making appropriations for invalid and other pen sions. Its consideration was postponed till Monday next. Mr. Stevens also reported a bill to sup ply the deficiency in appropriations for 1863, which was made a special order for Tuesday next The House then went into a Committee of the Whole on the President's Message. Mr. Noel, of Missouri, argued that the present organized Democratic party did not render unqualified support to the war, but was continually throwing obslaeles in the way of its prosecution. He undertook to say that it was a delusion to think that this war might have been prevented by the adoption of the Crittenden Compromise. It was true that some of the leaders of the rebellion had voted for that Compromise, but the history of subsequent events show that if ten or twelve voles had been necessary to defeat that meas ure, they could have been procured. He would go further and say that there was nothing in the Crittenden Compromise that would have prevented the rebellion. The enemies of the Administration held out the idea that the war was not for the restoration of peace but for the abolition of slavery, but this was untrue, aitnouga such might be the result. They assert that the Administration tramples on the Con stitution and that all the rights and privi leges under that instrument are to be swept by the board and that the Union is to be contended for without the Constitu tion. He had witnessed some of these so called violations of the Constitution. When war broke out the enemies of the country were not confined to the rebel States but were scattered all over tne land. Never was a Constitution so well con strued, notwithstanding the opinion of Judges Taney and Story as to the Presi dent's being guilty of a violation of the Constitution in suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. He justified President Lincoln in doing so. It was his duty to mse all means to suppress the re bellion. - - The confiscation of rebel property is another pretext for making war on the Administration. Men ot tne Doraer estates who have been trampled in the dust, take it as unkind that the enemies of the war expend their sympathy upon the wives and children of men engaged in the rebellion. The border States wish to see retribution visited on the rebels for their crimes. As-ain. the enemies of the war exhibit a frightful picture of tbe financial condition of the country, but those who got up the rebellion are responsible for every drop of blood, every dollar of extraordinary ex penditure, and for all irregularities com mitted. Mr. Noel proceeded to contrast the course of the anti-War party of 1812 with that of the present day, insisting that the Darallel was perfect. In this connection he quoted the position of the Federalists of Massachusetts at that time. Mr. Thomas, of Mass., interrupting, said If the gentleman from Missouri de sired in any way to give character t j the class of men whom both of them condemn ed, namely, the Peace Democrats, he couldn't have pursued a more effectual course, for the old Federalists of New Eng land were the most honest ana patriotic party that ever lived beneath the throne of God. Mr. Noel resuming, said he started with a proposition that the present organiied Democratic party was inconsistent. When slavery comes in as an element of rebel strength, and tne question is presented Be tween the perpetuation and preservation of the Union, then let the former die. He would so act in the suppression of the re bellion, that slavery should never produce results similar to tnose now witnessed. He was against compromising with men who were now endeavoring to break up the Government. He would agree to nothing but absolute submission on their part. He spoke the opinion of the straight out loyal men of the border States. In conclusion, he advocated emancipa tion in the border States. He stood by the GovernmenLanrf "r "r Tnon aj Johnsou. There were but two parties, one for war, the other for compromise. He would not lend himself to any scheme to produce strife among the people, to divide national councils ana wesaen ana un nerve the arm of the Government and strengthen the cause of the enemy. The Committee rose, when the resolu tions under consideration were reported and agreed to. They refer various branches of the President's annual mes- to appropriate committees.

FROM ARKANSAS. Fatettkville, Ark., Dec. 15. 1 Via Elkhoks, Dec. 17. The following additional particulars of the battle of Prairie Grove are received: The official report pets tbe loss in killed amd wounded of General Herron's com mand at 843, in General Blunt's 152; total 995. The latest accounts increase the rebel loss to 2700 killed and wounded, and near ly 6000 by desertion. Thirty-five commissioned officers of Herron's command were killed or wounded. The latest information by spies state that Hindman is on the south side of the Arkansas river with all the infantry and artilley. Marmaduke is on the north Bide with a heavy cavalry force. Our outposts are within 20 miles of Van Buren. Forage south of the Boston Mountains is said to be entirely consumed. Great activity prevails in the Federal army.- A campaign of much interest is on the tapsis. . - General Herron had only 8500 men in the battle, the remainder of his force fail ing to come np on account or excemi-r fatigue. Major Hubbard, 1st Missouri cavalry, who was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy on lie day of the battle, counted 22 regiments of infantry, 10 regiments of cavalry and 22 pieces of artillery on the retreat. Hindman yesterday had the impudence, by a flag of truce, to request the privilege to send topographioal engineers to make a drawing of the battle field of Prairie Grove and approaches. General Blunt re plied that he would grant the request when he was allowed to have his engineers make surreys of Van Buren and its surroundings. FROM WASHINGTON. WASHINGTON, Dec. 17.

To-day a highly influential delegation of Members of both Houses of Congress, with Vice President Hamlin at their head, waited on the President with a request, numerously Bigned by loyal men of Flori da, asking for the appointment of Hon. Eli Thayer as Military Governor of that State, with authority to raise 20,000 loyal emigrants. They also presented to the President a paper, signed by 34 members of theSen .te end Hwm, wV, i i wa. am..tly eon. curred in the request of the loyal men of Florida, and a paper from Major Ueneral Hunter, in command of the Department of tbe South, to the same ettect. lhe torn mittee was well satisfied with the inter view. 

FROM THE SEAT OF WAR. Headquarters Armt or Potomac, 1 December 17. Weather cold with north-east wind. Last night the enemy increased their intrenchments on the terraces in the rear of Fredericksburg and threw up rifle pits near the river, on the left of the city. To day their battalion drills were visible to the naked eye, on tbe plain. No movement of importance has taken place to-day. Our troops are in excellent condition and as enthusiastic! as they were previous to the late engagements. FROM NEW YORK. NEW YORK, Dec. 17. The Commercial Advertiser states that there is a rumor afloat that McClellan has been ordered to Washington, and that he is now at that place in consultation with the President and Cabinet. Anything def inite relative to the truth of this report we have failed to learn, but a gentleman intimately connected with all the doings of the government, said this morning that he would not be surprised to hear that McClellan is now at the capital on impor tant bnsiness. The schooner J. W. Conelon, 'from Gua- diloupe, reports the pirate vessel Alabama at Dominica on tbe 2th or November. There is a report that she chased a echoon er, which ran into Dominica for protection. The San Jacinto had been to uuaduoupe, but had gone to bt. Thomas. 

FROM ST. LOUIS. ST. LOUIS, Dec. 17. General Herron telegraphed to General Curtis that the victory at Prairie Grove was much more complete, and the enemy's loss far greater than at first reported. Over 1,-500 rebels were killed, and were v ,i vB - .s.. -w c rvisua scattered through tbe woods for miles in the rear of their position, where they had been carried during the action and left when they retreated. Many consequently died for want of attention. Our cavalry pursued the retreating rebels closely, driving them beyond Van Buren. The position and eondition of our forces are excellent. The campaign has been most brilliant, reflecting great credit on the officers and men of the Army of the Frontier. FROM NEW JERSEY. NEWARK, N. J., Dec. 17. A forgery of $8,000 was perpetrated on three banks of this city to-day, by means of forged certificates and checks. Part payment was made on three, $1,000 of the Mechanic's Bank, and $500 in bills of the Newark City Bank, which latter were numbered from $l's to $10's. The forger is aged about 35 years,stout built and about gve feet nigh. The Danxs otter iuuu re ward for the detection oi tne torger. FROM TENNESSEE. CAIRO, Dec. 17. A considerable force of rebel eavalry is reported in the vicinity of Jackson, Ten nessee, supposed to be under Morgan. Am ple preparations are made to resist any attack. All quiet at Oxford. -' FROM KENTUCKY. LOUISVILLE, Dec. 17. A report is current to-day of the ingress of Morgan s Cavalry into Glasgow, but it is utterly discredited at headquarters. K0RSE-SHGEIN8.
