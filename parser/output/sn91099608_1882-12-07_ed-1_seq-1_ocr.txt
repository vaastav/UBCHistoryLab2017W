A Washington Iclogram upon tlio snb-: Mr. Ward will be catisfactorily unpple joct of civil nervico reform BOJB Xiopre- mooted by his efforts. Heutntive Norcrons, of Massachusetts baa introduced a bill to create a board of electors, to consist of one from each state elected by the people, and eligible the mime as the membors of tbo houso of opri's^iitut ives. The term of office is six years. The country is to be divi.k'd into postal districts, and postmasters shall be elccted by the people of the respective districts, subjeol to the confirmation of the board of electors, or by the post master-general. All other civil officers, as provided for in articlo 2, section 2, ol the constitution, except members of the cabinet, ambassadors, other foreign ministers and United States jadges, shall be elected and examined or confirmed by the house of electors. The houso of elec tors shall mako all rules governing its confirmations, elections of examinations of civil officers. Congress shall determine What class of postmasters shall be con firmed by the house of electors and what by the postmaster-general, and shall designate what officers shall be elccted, examined or confirmed by the house of electors, and also who slmll make ap pointments of minor officers. Congress shall have power to provide by law ior the filling of vacancies that may happen when the houso of electors is not in session. The election or appointment of all civil officers not appointed by the president as provided shall be for the term of five years. The president Bhall have power to remove any officer of the civil service for any reason except politi cal. A Washington special to the St. Paul Pioneer-Press says: Delegate Pettigrew of Dakota uaya that be intends to press for passage tho bili providing for a division of Dakota into two territories. While he intends to dfr all he can to secare tho passage of the Dakota admission bill, he is in clined to think there is little prospect of this being accomplished this season but in the event of a failure to secare this, he thinks it very important to the people of Dakota that there should be a division of the territory. Haid that in the talks had with senators, be un- derstood it was the purpose of those having the Dakota admission in charge to press it to pas sage as early as possible. The bill is the first one in the senate calendar as unfinished busi ness. Chairman Burrows of the house com mittee on territories Baid he intended to do all he could to secure the passage of the bill this this session. The bill is the thirty-sixth in ordebon the house calandar. Among the meas ures which precede it are some very important ones, which it is very doubtful can be passed thiB winter, and as unanimous consent cannot be obtained to take the Dakota bill up out of its order, it is extremely probable that the house bill cannot be passed. The bill will. thereforet have to come from the senate, and unless it is buried on the speaker's table, will be passed by the house this winter. It is pos sible the democrats may defeat tho bill by fili bustering to prevent it being taken from tho speaker's table. It is well enough to look out for the division bill in case admission fails, but if the admission measure is first on the senate calendar, we can see no reason for a failure of tho statehood project, excepting through filibustering tactics. It is more thnn probable that Delegate Pettigrew is not an ardent advocate of admission, while the experiences of last fall have bred a desire to rid himself of tlio north half of the territory and the powerful anti-Pettigrew element it contains. Should southern Dakota become a state within the next half year, there would be little chance of the election of Mr. Petti grew to any important office. His selfish ambition would naturally lead him to defer statehood, if possible, in his own interest without regard to the wishes of his constituents. He has already de clined to assist in removing the only ob stacle between us and statehood—the Yankton county bond matter. This does not make it appear that ho is ardently desirous of the admission of Dakota, It will be seen by the proceedings of of the city council that tlio long drawn out combat between that body and his honor, the mayor, has. come to an end, L. H. Eliot, one of the mayor's previous appointees having been nominated and confirmed city marshal at the last meet ing. Pat Brennan, having been elected to the office of sheriff of Yankton county, resigned his position as city marshal and and the necessity for filling the vacancy induced tlie council to concentrate a suf ficient number of votes upon Mr, Eliot to give him tho place. The ap pointment ia a good one, as the new mar shal has experience, capacity and lion esty. It is probable that tho people generally do not know the cause of this elongated contest. Our recollection that the temperance issue was raised in the beginning, and through this means, several of the alderman got into the habit of voting against tho mayor's nominations and could not break off sud' denly. In retaliation to tho other element in the council, refused to vote for a pro Minced temperance mac for president oE the city legislature, and dur ing all the weary months since tho spring election, that body has been destitute of a regular presiding offioer. Tho gap was filled, however, at the last meeting by the election of Alder man M. T. Woolley ae president and the cruel war is over. Mr. Woolley would have filled all tho requirements in the beginning, and now that the long defer red honor rests upon his head, it is cer taiu that ho will perform his duties ably and impartially. Just who comes out ahead is nncortain, but both sides seem to Lave cordially shaken hands ovor the sanguinary chasm. Another election tqiulo by the council at its last mooting was that of General W. H. H. Beadle for member of the board of education, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Itev. Joseph Ward, of the fourth district. General Beadle is pro emiucntly qualified for tho placc and the excellent service of noes ird Wo fully believe it would be better for all interested to have the city charter so amended as to make the mayor of the city Hie presiding officer in the council. Tliis consideration is his due and the people are not liable to elcct a man as the head of municipal affairs unless he is qualified to perform this work. Yellowstone 1'ark Railway. Washington, Dec. 4—A bill wag intro duced in the house to-day by Mr. Boae crans to incorporate the Yellowstone Park railway company. The corpora tors named in the bill are Solomon Hydenfeldt, Louis C. Whiton, Fred Elliott Elldridge, W. P. Bruff, Julius Bandman, James Murphy, Washington Hills, Jr.. ]J. P. Crane, Jr., Edward W.

The road is to run from a point at or near Market Lake, Idaho through the Teton range of the ltocky mountains by Buark's pass to the foot of Mount 8herida» in the Yellowstone Park, Wyo., thence to the Upper Geyser, the Lower Geyser, upper falls ot tho Yellowstone river and Emigrant Gnlf in Montana, on to the most available point on the Northern Pacific. The capital stock of the com pany is to be 86,000,000. The company is to charge for passengers not to exceed 7 cents a mile, and for freight not to exeeed 15 cents per ton per mile. Sent for by Baker Pasha. Corporal Gephard Leberecht Blucher, poBt schoolmaster at Fort McHenry, a few days ago received from Baker Pasha an offer of a position on his staff to aid in the reorganization of the army of the khedive of Egypt. Corporal Blucher is a lineal descendant of the fa mous Marshal Blucher, prince of Wahl stadt, of Waterloo fame, after whom he is named. He graduated at the universi ties Bonn and Heidelberg. In 1865 he entered the Prussian army as a second lieutenant tin the first regiment of the guards, and during the Austro-Prnssian war was aid-de-camp on the staff of the general commanding the seventh corps, Subsequently he was chosen a military attache of the German legation in Egypt, and resided for a long time at Rnmleh. While in Egypt he aoqoired the Arabic tongue. In'1867 he was pro moted to a first lieutenancy, and in the Franco-Prussian war he again performed the duties of aid-de-camp. During the campaign he was appointed military ad ministrator of the department of the marine, which post he held until the withdrawal of the Prussian army of oc cupation. In 1880 ho quitted the army and came to America. Sixteen months ago he enlisted in the Second artillery as schoolmaster. Corporal Blucher first knew Baker Pasha when he was Captain Valentine Baker. Railroad Rates at St. Paul. St. Paul Pioneer-PresH. The cut-rate passenger business was quite active yesterday, and a decided im provement upon that of Saturday and Sunday. PnsseDgers bought tickets for all points. Tlio traffic was rather quiet early in the day, but later it revived at the assistant ticket offices. At the Union depot there wns no rush, but a steady demand that kept the boys fairly busy. It was reported that the Albert Lea route had made a change in its rates from Chi cago to St. Paul. The rate of $1.00 from Chicago to Chaska has been withdrawn. The rate from Chicago to Albert Lea is $1.00, and from Albert Lea to St. Paul S5.25, making the rate for the whole trip S5.25 instead of S2.20 via Chaska. What effect this will have on Chicago travel remains to be seen hereafter. Excur sionists have gone to Chicago by the dol lar route and return by the $2.20 route, that is now a 55.25 one. In freight mat ters, the Omaha line has advanced the rate in grain and flour between St. Paul, Minneapolis and Chicago, from 5c per 100 pounds to 7}£c per 100, which latter is now the saaie as the cut-rates by the Chicago, Milwaukee &St. Paul. Aside from the above items, there have been no other ehupges. Busines now isof the routine order, and officials and agents pursue their avocations as if there were no such trifles as cuts. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. It Receives General Commendation In til. Senate. Washington, Dec. 1—The senators list ened with great attention to the reading of the president's message. It was very generally commented upon as being vig orous in style, bold in its recommenda tions, and withal extremely temperate and well timed. Like all of President Arthur's public papers, it is regarded as a masterpiece of composition and schol arly writinr. The only adverse criticism heard generally upon the republican side of the houso was upon tho proposition to abolish the tax on tobacco. Senators Windom and Allison among others, ex, pressed themselves as not in accord with the message on this point. Senator Logan said tho message was satisfactory and indeed masterly. Senator Ingallsfc in his incisive way said biusquely: "Tbe tone of tho message is ambitious." Taken AB a whole it was regarded by the senate with satisfaction. His views regarding civil service re form, which have been outlined in these dispatches, meet the views exactly of the republican members. In fact, there is not a single republican who dares to say aught against the reform movement. This statement is borne out to-day in the proceedings of the honse, when as an ticipated in these dispatches nearly a week ago, a decisive step was taken in the direction of legislation upon the sub ject. The president's views and recommen dations in regard to politioal assessments are also regarded as a good departure from the old school. As to his recommendations regarding the reduction of taxation the drift of sentiment among republicans is in exact accord with them. These three topics, civil service reform, political assessments, and tax reduction, including tariff revision, are regarded tut tho three principal features of tbe message, and are very highly commended by senators au.l members of all parties. In commenting in oonnootion with the message upon tho president's recent ao- tipn with reference to tho star-route trials, the suggestion wae made by a member this evening that President Ar thur was evidently trying to build up the shattered fortunes of the republican party, and to reunite and harmonize the elements into which the party has dis solved. The liojw is expressed that this is really the president's purpose. Curious Humor*. Washington special to New YorkSnn: We are told that a petition is now quiet ly circulated asking congress to repeal so much of the appropriation bill for tbe current year as makes the retirement of General Sherman compulsory upon his attaining the age of sixty-four. One of the arguments in favor of this measure is, that in esse of tbe retirement of Sher man, as the law now provides, the com mand of the army will devolve upon Lieutenant-General Sheridan during what may prove a critical presidential campaign. The supposed hostility to Sheridan on the part of tbe democratic metnbeiB is the remembrance of his cele brated banditti dispatch sent at the time he was in command in New Orleans. On the other hand, it is averred that a com bination of the friends of- Sheridan and Hancock will ask that the grades of gen eral and lieutenant-general be revised— the understanding being that Sheridan shall be promoted to be general, and Hancock to be lieutenant-general. Others, who are inimical to both Sher man and Sheridan, say that they prefer that the former shall retire next year, as the law now provides and when they have elected a democratic president, as thoy expect to do the following year, should Sherman continue to be objec tionable, they will revive the grade of general, and promote Hancock to tbe place and command of tho army. The advocates of the latter course claim that there would be ample justification for it in the precedents established by Sheri dan's own promotions. In 1864, when he was promoted to be major-general, he imped Hancock, who ranked him as a rigadier and when in 1859, Grant made him lieutenant-general, he over-slaughed Halleck and Meade, although the former was a full major-general before Sheridan was even a major. THE 

REGISTRY LAW. A Protection Against Fraud—It Works Well in a Mining Country. Deadwood Times. As this is a republican government, where the will of the people is the law, and as the will of the people can only become known through their votes in elections, it is of vital importance that elections should be fair and honest. We all kao what desperate and unscru pulous politicians and factions are cap aple of. It is a notorious fact that all manner of crime and rascality has been resorted to, to defeat the will of the and secure victory for parties 'he oharge of corrnption and fraud can not be laid at the door of any particu lar party. clique, faction and Everv party in the land has'been guilty of it, and some unfortunately, especially in the great centers of population, depend directly upon chicanery and such sharp practice for their success. Men do not comprehend the importance— the abso lute saeredness, of their franchise, or they would guard^it as their life and honor, as the visible embodiment of liberty and all that is good and glorious for the down-trodden of p-11 lands. The man who sells his vote is a renegade to his race. Votes have been bought and sold in open market, men have voted time and again, falsely and illegally. Repeating has become a profession. The will of the people has been defeated by fraud and this in a republic is the unpardonable sin. Knowing thei psrils tha't threaten the very existence of a republic, we cannot be over cautious, neither can we throw too many safe guards, even though they may be incon venient and vexatious, around the ballot, to keepit pure and honest, to have it, as it is intended to be, an expression of the will of the people. The Kapid City Journal takes exceptions, and as it ap pears to us, without solid reasons to the registry law passed two years ago for the benefit o! the Black Hills counties. The Journal knows that in the early days unblushing frauds were perpetrated. It was to prevent them that the registry law was passed. As for the inconvenience of the law, that is a childish arguement. All laws are objectionable to evil doers. If the law does not reach the evil, let it be amended until it does. We -cannot but think that fraudulent voting is an evil, and that tbe present law does in a measure remedy it, the Journal to the contrary, notwith standing. The Journal's argument does not touch what might be regarded as objeotionable in the act, but is a special plea, reeking with demagoguery in aid and comfort of every turncoat, bilk, and repeater in the country. The Journal complains of the inconvenience the law causes. This is the truth, it is inconven ient—it ia very inconvenient and per haps wrong, according to the Journal's logic, to have to go a mile, or perhaps, a dozen miles, to vote, but if tho voter re gards his right he does go, and should also go and register. "Eternal vigilance is the price of lib erty," to which may be added a little personal inconvenience, and perhaps toil. Bat unfortunately, the eternal laws are so arbitrary, we have no elevator to hoist us into heaven, we must do something" to get there. This nation foandfreedom through hard knocks, aiul can only keepit by guarding and work ing for it. The Journal speaks of the unjust workings of the law at Lead City. The monopoly, corruption faction, at tempted a swindle on the people but lacked the brains to carry it out. A tool of tbe monopoly, with unbounded appe tite for dirty work, but with no sense to speak of, attempted to fix up (he regis try lists. The names of all men then employed, or whoever had been employed by the monopoly—the living, the dead, the absent, the present, all were therein recorded. Not in alphabetical order, as the law commands, but in a jumble, just as they appeared on the pay rolls. The brilliant head and the brilliant tail of this neat job wagged with joy, but it didn't work, in tact, it was a boomerans, which flew back and would have knocked their brains out, had nature so furnished them. Men had to stand at the polls many minutes before their names could be discovered and identified among the confused jumble. By this means, the trioksters ruined themselves through their own stupidity. The registry law does protect elections, if it is observed. Let us retaiu this law, and if need be, amend it. The people want the law. Tho Pioneer copies the Journal's article, with the the endorse ment, "a sound articlo." Where sound —exoept that it full of sound and furv, signifying nothing. && .J tr* %ri&*
