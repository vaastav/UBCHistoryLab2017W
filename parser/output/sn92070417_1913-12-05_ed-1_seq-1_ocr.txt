Although. Francisco Villa's force of 7,000 men was within a few miles of Chihuahua today it had not actually entered the city at 10:30 o'clock. Villa regards the capture of the city as a mere formality, as the civil governor was ordered by General Mercado to turn the place over to the rebels. In anticipation of an important con ference with Carranza, head of the rev olutionary government, General BYan cisco Villa, the rebel commander, re turned today from the vicinity of Chihuahua, without having entered the city, to Villa Ahumada, 80 miles south of the border. It was said recent events, such as the evacuation of Chihuahua and the further extension of rebel territory, necessitated a more united under standing concerning future opera tions. Villa today requested Carranza at Hermosillo to proceed on to Chihua hua for the conference or to go to Villa Ahumada. Should Carranza de cide to go by way of Juarez he would have toravel through United States territory, crossing at Nogales." In that event Carranza would come northward from the vicinity of Chihuahua to Villa Ahumada, the nearest town with telegraph communication. Villa hopes in his trip south of Chihuahua, after the conference with Carranza, to wim some victories through further desertions by the fed erals, thousands of whom have been isolated and without pay for weeks.

Rail communication be tween Saltillo and Torreon continues uncertain. j Huerta's Family In Vera Cruz Mexico City, Deo. 5. The family of Provisional President Huerta is said to have gone secretly to Vera Cruz on November 30. They are liivng quietly in that city, shere their pres ence is known to a few intimate friends. The departure of the Huerta family on that date on a special train gave rise to.,th ?.-nort that the presi dent himself had left Mexico City. The report in regard to Huerta was based onthe fact that he boardad the special early in the morning and accompanied his family as far as Tex coco, a few miles out, returning later to the federal capital In an automo bile. , Paper Roasts Wilson Commenting on the initiative in connection with the .National Guard taken by James Hay, congressman from Virginia, in introducing the ar my volunteer bill in the house of rep resentatives at Washington, El Diarlo nays: "Following President Wilson's flat declaration that he will not Intervene by force of arms in our affairs, Mr. Hay asks Jhe American congress to give the executive ample powers to call on the National Guard for active service.!' - 4 u utiwajjayer proceeds to com ment sarcastically upon the unanim ity of thought, indicated .by the con tradictory attitude of President Wil son and of the chairman of the house of representatives committee on military affairs. It continues: "The Mexican Question has had per haps in a minor degree the effect of the Dreyfuss case in France of con founding all critics :wlth this differ ence, however, that although the citi zens' and partisans of France lost their heads, the government of France maintained its serenity and coolness. In the United States the first to lose its bearings was the government and today the citizens and partisans in the United States show themselves to be under better self-control than the chief American magistrate.. His change of front toward us,' accentuat ed by the press and by influential leaders, has long been noticeable. Since nothing happens without some good coming fronlit, the rebels them selves, the spoiled children of Presi dent Wilson, have by their evil deeds Inspired the American people, the con servative press and the reasonable leaders of the senate and the house of representatives with the conviction that the aims of the revolution are unworthy and a menace to civiliza tion." . The editorial concludes: "In any event It wil always be a consolation to us that in the Ameri can congress there are such leaders as Mann to defend us against the rage of the government. The situation Is parallel to that in France when Jules Fabre and his friends defended us against the second empire which trampled on us, and which the gov ernment In the White House would like to do."

SUFFRAGE IS TOOL OF " MORMON CHURCH THIS IS THE ARGUMENT USED AGAINST IT BY A NEW YORK WOMAN ', ' Washington, Dee..r-Mrs. William ; F. Scott of New -York, chairman of a the legislative committee of the Guid eon Club Opposed to Woman Suffrage, addressed the house rules committee today in arguments against a stand ing committee on suffrage. 'tEach successful suffrage cam paign," she," said, "has been carried by an appeal to the people to rise against the law and the existing gov ernment under the dictates of self interest. In Los Angeles the ,'juffra- gists chanted to the beat of marching feet, as the labor unions and socialist organizations marched bareheaded past the prison in which the McNa maras awaited their fate, 'You vote for us and we'll vote for you.' " She urged that the federal govern ment have nothing to do with the suf- .frage question; that it, should be left to the states. In this she was sup ported by Mr. and Mrs. Rosaiter John son, also of the Guideon club of New York. Mrs. Johnson insisted that any state desiring woman suffrage was at liberty to have it -without any amendment ' of the federal constitu tion or any action of congress what ever." - .77 "In making any advance toward woman suffrage," said Mrs. Johnson, "this government"' would be playing into the hands of two forces within the United States that desire the re public's overthrow. These forces are socialism and Momionism. The lat ter introduced woman 'suffrage into this country while Utah was a ter ritory, and socialism is responsible for every other .particle of political woman suffrage in this country or In any other." ORGANIZER TAKE IN CUSTODY BY SOLDIERS ADOLPH GERMER SAID TO BE RE ' SPONSIBLE FOR STRIKE OUTRAGES OPERATES AT WALSENEUCO THE MILITARY COMMISSION WILL HOLD A HEARING IN THAT PLACE SOON ZANCANELLI IS ACCUSED QIVIL AUTHORITIES CHARGE HIM WITH THE MURDER OF A DETECTIVE Trinidad, Colo., Dec. 5i Adolph Geimer, international organizer of the United Mine Workers of America, who haa directed strike operations in the Walsenburg district since the strike was called and who was placed under military arrest early today at that place, will be brought before the military commissioners tpmorrow for examination.

Louis Zancanelll, held by the mili tary authorities for the killing of De tective George W. Belcher since No vember 20, was formally charged with the crime in an information filed-in the district court this morning by District Attorney J, J. Hendricks. The verdict of the coroner's jury did not implicate Zancanelll, and today's action Is the first taken by the civil authorities against the prisoner. The military commission resumed an investigation of tne: Belcher kill ing again this morning' and a finding probably will be made i 'public during the day. - About 50 strikers have applied for work at the mines in the district since yesterday, according to reports received at the local offices of the operators. Snow Causes Suffering A heavy snowstorm, which, accom panied with a high wind, has now as sumed the proportions of ''a blizzard, continued to rage throughout the strike zone today causing much hard ship and suffering among the strik ers in the tent colonies and the sol diers of the National Guard. Traffic fafil a standstill and it is now Impos sible to move supplies to the outlying' districts. Nearly three feet of snow has fallen aKd fears are entertained that the strikers and their families, numbering nearly 3,000, will suffer from hafigefpiMi' exposure before food and fuel caii be supplied. Train service north of Trinidad is deinora'ized. No serious wire trou ble is reported. ' - The storm is interfering seriously with the limited coal mining opera tions and the supply on hand is not large. Because of the difficulty and ex pense that would be encountered in bringing details of soldiers now on duty at outlying points to Trinidad and Walsenburg, State Auditor Roady Kenehan nd .State Treasurer M. J. Leddy have acceded to the request of General Chase that the men be paid at the several stations. Storm condi tions, however, have stopped the work of the state officials for the present and some of the soldiers may not re ceive their money for several days. v;
