The message of the president of the United States to the last session of the 59th Congress is one of the best and moat remarkable messages ever sent to any congress by any president of the republic. It is a long but a most read able document, and will be widely read because of the great importance to the country of the subjects discussed, and because it bears upon every page and in almost every line the energetic personality of its author. It is plain to be seen that the president is fully aware that he has the people at his back in his administration of their affairs, and he not only recommends to congress what reforms the country needs, but he insists upon their enact ment into law. He knows what is needed and he goes after it with his usual strenuosity. While he does not attempt to in any way coerce or brow beat the congress, he argues and ad vises and reccmmends with an assur ance that has not been assumed by any president in recent years. Much of the message is given over to a discussion of old topics, such as justice to the Phillipines, the rehabili tation of our merchant marine, the reform of federal court proceedure, the control of corporate holdings, the interstate commerce commission, and the like, but he informs the congress, in effect, that he will keep after them until they do their duty in these mat ters and that he speaks to them as the voice of the people. He well knows that many members of congress owe their seats in the present house to his personal efforts in their personal be half, and the people may safely rely on their supporting the president in passing such remedial legislation at this session. The Tacoma Ledger says editorially: "Americans who wish to understand the issues of the day cannot afford to ignore the message. It is full of meat —full of thought, forcibly, clearly and often splendidly expressed. They may not always agree with its author, but in the main they will not only agree but applaud. Mr. Roosevelt's utter ances on the preservation of the equity powers of the courts againit the anti injunction frenzy, on the relations of capita) and labor, on the preservation of the remaining public coal lands from private appropriation, on the necessity for national regulation of divorce, on the revival of lynching in the south, on the need of national sanity regarding corporations and wealth, on the crime on chilil labor, on the national defense, on currency reform and the call for a bank currency law, on the duty of national good manners and observation of treaties with the Japanese and other nations, on our wark in Cuba and our relations with South America—all these and many other passages show him in close touch with the best conservative sentiment of thoughtful Americans in all parts of the country. The message is the word of no radical, but of a strong man speaking for a progressive nation. It would be a noteworthy document even if it did not contain other passages of the greatest import ance on further national supervision of corporations and the need of federal inheritance and income tax." Washinqton Chat. Much speculation is rife in all quar ters as to what Congress may do and may not do during the three months session just begun and which will ad journ March 7, 1907. As there are so many government supply bills to be passed it is unlikely that there will be much of a chance for general legisla tion. Possibly the river and the har bor bill carrying about sixty million dollars, stands the best show. Next comes the Phillipine tariff bill and then the immigration bill. Outside of these three measures and the passage of general appropriation bills, both houses will be content to do little else than talk, thus sustaining the record estab lished in the first half of the session in which it is estimated that "hot air" was let loose to the amount of fifty million words. Plenty of material is still awaiting i discussion and it is probable that con siderable talk will result from the re- j recent dismissal by the President of a j battalion of negro troops. The Smoot cast' is to be argued in the Senate and ! a vote had if possible. The Santo Domingo treaty which has been before the Senate two years, will receive at-' tention, also the Isles of Pine treaty. ! The bill limiting the hours of contin-! uous labor for railroad employes will i come up early in the session. The question of bigger battleships will be one of the important subjects discussed and of course the Panama canal will always be a lively question. It is hardly probable that much head way will be made in measures for re ferring the currency and it is the con sensus of opinion that neither the eight hour law or the anti-injunction measure both advocated by labor organizations will become laws until late in the session, if at all. One thing is certain, Congress is now open and will speak for itself. The deplorable conditions existing in the public printing office are far from being settled and the public printer continues to be the target for all the criticisms, with the result that he has asked of congress a complete investi gation of his management of the office since taking charge. The employees are in a constant state of unrest, spend much of their time in relating real or fancied grievances and most of them never know when they report for duty in the morning whether they will be discharged "without cause" before the day is over. In consequence of this long drawn out state of restlessness, the sen ate committee on printing will shortly take matters in its own hands. A bill will be devised abolishing the of fice of public printer and provide that the administration of affairs be vested in a resident committee of three, to be appointed by congress, and which will act as a court of last resort in the set tling of differences. It is believed the establishment of such a board to take charge of the big plant, will eliminate all personality and do away entirely with dissatisfaction, discontent and un rest among the several thousand em ployees. Grievances will go before the three heads and when decisions are rendered the employees will have no recourse and cannot resort to the plea of personal animosity when ruled against, such as is now the case under the one man power. Considerable interest is being man- j ifested in the preservation of the Key mansion, located on Pennsylvania ave nue in Georgetown and in which Fran cis Scott Key, the author of "The Star Spangled Banner" lived for many years and the idea to purchase the property by a memorial association was sug gested by the fact that the legislature of Massachusetts appropriated a sum sufficient to preserve the home of Dr. Samuel Smith, the author of "Ameri ca". The owners of the Key mansion were planning to tear it down and build small stores but the local patriots were inspired to prevent what they felt a desecration and prevailed upon the owners to suspend building operations for six months, by which time it is ex pected to have the purchase price raised by popular subscription. Public interest have been steadily increasing in this historic old mansion ever since President Roosevelt decided "The Star Spangled Banner" was the national anthem. This question was settled at the time that several foreign governments requested the United States to furnish a copy of its national air. The state department officials were in a quandary. Some held that ' 'America'' was the national song others claimed that "Hail Columbia" should be designated but the president de clared for the song written by Key and in this way it received official recog nition. Simplified spelling, as advocated by President Roosevelt, has received its first real set back in the house com mittee on appropriation. It is the plan of this committee to influence Congress to refuse from the Government Print ing Office all documents and reports in which the new form of spelling is used. The estimates for the cost of printing are submitted to the committee in question and it now appears that there will be considerable increase in the expense of documents if they are set up and printed with two distinct forms of spelling. This fact alone will carry great weight with both Houses as each is determined to do its best to reduce the cost of public printing. The opin ion is universal among committee mem bers that all reports transmitted to Congress from the departments that are to be issued as Congressional doc uments and that all laws passed by Congress, should be printed in the old fashioned way and that Congress should not tolerate any interference in the matter. Visitors at the White House these days find their interest centered in Mrs. Roosevelt's collection of Japanese dolls which she has generously placed where the visiting public may enjoy the sight of them. The dolls, which were the gift of the Japanese Am bassador, are kept under a glass in a cabinet in the famous Red Room. This unique collection of little Japs, dressed in the ancient native costume of the country from which they came is superior in charm and value to any collection in any museum of the United States. It is probable that later on, the collection will be placed in the National Museum where it will bear a tag reading "Loaned by Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt". SAY
