The door leading to an sthtnian canal was oi»ened in Washington yesterday for Congress to pass through. This was effected in the pres entation of two documents to Congress. One was the Hay-Pauncefote Treaty, sigued by the diplomatic representatives of (Jreat Britain and the T'niTed States and ready for ratification ly the Senate. Su. laiinVaiiou is all that is needed for sweeping away the last vestUe Of diplomatic obstacles and for giving the United ■hsssa the fullest authority under internation.n law and iv the eyes of all ibe world to proceed with the construction of the canal as a purely and exclusively American enterprise. We have already discussed the provisions of the new treaty, and need not consider them again at this time, further than to quote the President's terse yet comprehensive digest of them. The new treaty, he says, abrogates the old Claytou- Bulwer Treaty, and, in addition: It specifically provides that the United State? alone shall do the work of building and assume the responsiVlitv of raf>jruardh:g the canal, and shall repulate its neutral ute by all nations on terms of equality without the guarantee or in terference of any outside nation from any quar ter. The other document laid before Congress was the report ol the Isthmian Canal Commission. This will serve as ■ guide to Osßgresi in de termining where aad how. the canal is to be constructed. It is tBC latest, and should l»e the last, of a sssaahsr of reports upon the subject. Thetv could It** no h"j.M> of getting a report more carefully prepared or by a more authorita tive commission. The rei>ort is impartial, ex haustive and tinal. It contains all needed in formation to guide Congressional action, and should form the bar-is of action at an early date. It will not please all. parties. That was in evitable. The commission was not appointed to make a special plea for auy one route, and It has rot done so. If It had, it would, of course, hare displeased the advocate* of tbe other route*. It has aimed to make dear the reepec tlre advantages and disadvantages of all rontw, or of the two principal one* uu«W considera tion, and tliua to i*nnble Congress to make an «n telliff«iit choice of the one which i« to be Sdopte.i.

It will take thirty-three hours to pass through the former, and only twelve to pass through the latter: but for all except Peruvian and Chilian ports there is a compensating saving of time on the Nicaragua route, and. of course, the bulk of traffic will be to other ports tbau those of the west coast of South America. Hygienic conditions are the better at Nicaragua. These are the chief points in the report. The i*ommi.ssion sums the matter up by saying that iv view af all the facts it is of opinion that the Nicaragua route is the most practicable for a canal which i* to be under the con trol, management and ownership of the I'nited States. That is an opinion often expressed hitherto in these columns, and long held by the great majority of Americans who have given to the subject serious consideration. It is gratifying to Lav • it thus continued by the most authoritative body that has ever investigated the case. We shall see if Congress, after re viewing the facts, comes to the same conclusion as the commission. It will be strange If it does not. And it will be strange if it does not promptly take advantage of the door which has thus been opened and of tbe guidance which is thus provided, and proceed with the construc tion of a work which the President has well de scrilted as of supreme importance to the Amer ican people an.l as "a work which it is for the "interest of the entire country to begin and "complete as soon as possible." 

SBCKBTAMW BA4HFB RFi'ORT. Tbe annual report of Secretary Gage is par ticularly interesting this year because of the frank and able manner in which the Secretary discusses the weak spots n our national bank ing system and our currency laws. Iv the minds of most American citizens the national banking system is the best system in the world, and it takes more than ordinary courage for a public man to combat thai idea. Secretary <J;ige. however, combats it dearly and convinc ingly, and tbe portion of his report which is de voted to banking and currency deserves the careful study of every voter. His recommenda tions for reduction of the revenue, disposition of the surplus and various improvements in the public service have been and will be discussed in connection with the President's Message and the deliberations of Congress, so that it is neces sary here to call attention only to his sugges tions for the strengthening of the banking sys tem and the reform of the eurr- ucy. Touching first upen banking in general, the Secretary lucidly and soundly explains the func tion of a modern bank, and points out the main weakness in our system, the feature that justi fies his terse criticism that it is a system adapted for fair weather and not for foul. When business trouble comes there is no co-ordina tion or co-operation between banks except such as is voluntary. The weakness lies not so much in the iWisimrnn of each of the four thousand independent units as in the necessity which compels individual measures of self-preserva tion on the part of each. In union there is strength, and the Secretary suggests as a prac ticable means of obtaining that strength a feder ation of existing banks, which should own the stock of and control a truly national bank, a bank af the nation, with which only other banks and the government should deal. The idea may sound startling at first, but it seems by no means: impracticable. The voluntary union of the New-York banks, expressed through the action of the Clearing House in 1883, probably saved the country from the wor«t financial crash in history. A union of all the banks of the country, expressed through a great central bank, would be a power for safety far greater than the New-York Clearing House. In ad dition it might solve the independent Treasury problem. The hundreds of millions of dollars locked up in the Treasury arc at all times as absolutely lost to the business world t;s though they were at the bottom of the sea. In times of heavy SaVphM revenue they become an actual menace to the count r.-. A federated bank could easily be made the depositary of the govern ment, and the nation-- money would at last be placed at the disposal of the nation with abso lute safety to ail. Any one who has ever urged currency reform, abolition of the greenbacks and extension of na tlo'.-al bank eircul ltioi. upon the average voter has found tbetirst stumbling block in the stereo typed objection: "The banks issue circulation "because it is profitable. They draw interest "on the money they invest ia the bonds which "are tbe security for their notes, and then they "turn around and lend those notes to the pub "lie and get more Interest. We want no Shy "lock notes. The government is behind the "greenbacks. They are good enough for us." Empty as this view is to those who know, it is the prevalent one. No amount of demonstration that the money invested in iurnds might other wise be loaned directly to the bank's customers. that engraving charges, express charges, cir culation tax. redemption tax and premium on the bonds must l>e considered before the profits are counted, will convince the average Ameri can citizen that banks are not especially fa vored whe'i they are permitted to issue circulat ing notes. Therefore one great step In currency reform ought to be accomplished by tbe official declaration of Secretary Gage that, according to the most careful computations <»f the govern ment actuaries, the extreme profit to the most favorably situated banks is less than three fourth •; of 1 per cent on their note circulation! And. paradoxical as it may seem to those who have not figured the problem out for thems elves, this niaxiiiuin profit is earned by the banks in the big money centres, where cur rency is plenty and interest rates are low. Thus, in communities where the prevailing rate of in terest is 4 per cent, the profit on circulation Is seventy hundredths of 1 per cent, shrinking to thirty-one hundredths of 1 per cent wheu Interest rates rise to S per cent. In view of These riirnn>s it is easily seen that the main ob ject of a banknote circulation— to supply cur rency where and when it is most needed— is actually defeated by present conditions, for where the need for currency is greatest the In ducement to issue it is least, and where the need is least the inducement is greatest. The Secretary makes no effort to dogmatize in favor of a specific remedy, but puts forth a tenta- Tive suggestion on which he invites criticism and discussion. His plan would not solve the whole question, for it would cease to work when the bonded debt is extinguished, as it surely will be in time. But the adoption of the plan would be a vast stride in the right direction, and its successful operation an object lesson that would make subsequent advances easy of accomplish ment. In brief, the proposition is to abolish the legal requirement of a dollar for dollar bond security for banknotes, and to permit tbe issue by any national bank of nn amount of note* not to exceed its fully paid up capital upon the deposit with tin* Treasury Department of T'nlted ■ultes bonils t.,jiiftl to SO per cent of the issue and of green baekH equal to "0 per cent.

At the same time tbe conditions as re-ards inducement to the banks to Issue notes would be far more rational and attractive, nmountiug to a possible profit of nearly 4 per cent when money brings 8 per cent, and drop ping to about 2 per cent when interest falls to 4 per cent, thus providing the much needed auto matic elasticity of currency. THE 

BWAX SONG OF RICH A HI) CHOKER. On the assumption that there is no string at tached to Mr. Croker'a retirement from the lead ership of Tammany Hall, it may be said that nothing in his career as the head of the orgau ization has so well become him as the manner in wfetcfa he announces his more or less volun tary decapitation. No one could suppose from rending the reports in yesterday"s papers of the interview to which be invited their representa tives that he ha,l been a conscienceless despot for many years and working for his own pocket all the time. His remarks are rather those of a political sage just escaping from a long martyrdom of public service and preparing to reward himself with a period of well earned re pose. He talks in a mild and pensive strain, which takes on a tinge of gloom as he reflects upon the long labors which have shattered his health and compelled him to depart in search of the rest which be Is never able to find in this country, where the reporters camp around him. however great bis need of solitude. The only thing tliat temporarily arouses him from this mood of gentle melancholy is an intimation that his bear! does not beat quite as warmly for his adopted land as it used to. Witli rather more fervor than delicacy of expression he de clares that idea to be -rot"; but under the cir cumstances tl-.e characterisation may be par doned, for nothing is more certain than tbe be lief that his exploitation as the Squire <>f Wan tage cost Tammany a great many votes at the recent election. It has to be admitted, however, that Mr. Cro ker"s estimate of the temporal Insignificance of his visits abroad is subject to some slight re vision. His understanding of the matter seems to be that be goes to England occasionally for a little while to recuperate, whereas the cold and Nspposabty repulsive fad is that his latest sojourn there lasted about ten months. liV sailed on November 18, !!•<><>. and did not resume the freedom of this city until September U. IJN>I. H«> will soon leave us again, and the common impression is that he will not return earlier than the opening "f the municipal cam paign of 1008. But without attempting to pene trate th>- futur.-. it is fair to Bay ih.it Mie p:i<t is considerably less secure from the residential point of view than lie would like to believe. However, it night !>♦> ungracious to intrude upon his weary spirit the preval.-iu conviction that many thousands of Irish-American voters "had It in for him" on this account, for be pays an exceedingly handsome tribute to the power of the press, of which w€ are duly appreciative. He says there is no use in looking around for other causes of the Tammany eclipse. One cause was sufficient -the opposition of all ilm newspapers in New-York. It might be remarked in passing that all the newspapers m New-York would not have been against Tammany govern ment if it had not been quite as black as Mr. Edward If. Sbepard painted it ■ few years ago, ur. if such a miracle could have been accom plished, that their united hostility would not have sufficed to overthrow a virtuous adminis tration. This community has not 'Heretofore been war ranted in looking to Mr. Croker "for doctrine, ••for reproof, for correction, for instruction in "righteousness," and we should hardly say even now that tbe time had arrived for such an ap plication; but there is no reason why it should not accept a warning from him when be offers one like this: U A defeat once in I while is a •good thing for any organization. After the "fusioiiists have been In office a couple of years "the people will see that tho Tammany admin istration was not such a bad thing after all. "Wo have been downed before by reform niove •'iiients. and we always rose up stronger than "ever after a few years. It will be the same "story in 1903. Tammany* is close to the com "nion people of New-York." Now, there is no possibility that the conduct of public affairs during the last four years will ever be vindi cated by what may OeCUT at some later period: neither Is there the slightest reason to doubt that the next administration will be an Immense Improvement upon that which is now drawing to a close. Bui the fact remains that If tbe triumphant assertion of municipal decency which has lately linen witnessed proves to be a mere spasm of virtue, and the reputable public relapses into that too familiar state of Indiffer ence which bus given the industrious forces of evil so many opportunities, it will be almost as hard to keep Tninmany out of power two years heuce ac it was to turn it out last mouth. Furthermore, whatever tbe fact may be now, i' was true for a long time that Tammany was "dose to the common people of New-York." It got and stayed close by constantly exhibiting a keen interest in them and by a policy of benev oleuee which was profligate but practical. There Is a lesson in that state of relations and its re sults which the opponents of Tammany need to learn and to apply with equal skill in blame less ways. WAMNIVea TO PABBENQBBB. New-Yorkers who have had experience on tbe streetcars in Washington say that it is the prac tice of conductors there to give warning to women and aged or heedless men that they should take pains to look out for cars approach- Ing on the opposite track when they are getting off the platforms. It would be the part of -wis dom for the companies which control the lines in cvpry borough In this city to Issue instructions to their employe* to follow the excellent »'X ample of the conductors of the District of Columbia, and it wouM be sagacious and pru dent, moreover, to see to It that those lnatrue tioo* were obeyed.

The Agrarian tariff bill is up in the German Parliament. Now for a battle royal, or impe rial, between agrarians and industrialists. Mr Croker announces that he is getting old and talks of his r-ed of rest. But did he not spend the greater part of the last dozen months in resting in England? He has a great deal to say about the possibility of his retirement from active service for his party. In fact, he is be coming too garrulous for his own interests and the advantage of his followers. When he is a* l?>nt the Tammany boss is a grim and for midable figure. When his tongue begins wag ging he damages himself more than any one else. Recorder Golfs instructions to the members of the December grand Jury were straight, clear and sound. This Judicial officer never delivered a more impressive charge; and these jurorg can do a great deal for common honesty and the benefit of New-York this month. The new ferry line between East Forty-sec ond-st and the Eastern District of Brooklyn will help many Brooklyn people to save time when they wish to take trains at the Grand Central Station. But there should be more boats. And they should begin running earlier, should run later, and should make more frequent trips. Mr. Rives, the Corporation Counsel designate, could not have found a better man for assistant to take charge of the Brooklyn business of the department than James McKeen, whom he has selected for that office. Like Mr. Rives himself, he was a member of the Charter Revision Com mission, and knows as few men can know the provisions of the instrument from which the city government derives its powers. He is an able lawyer, experienced in dealing with men and affairs, a well balanced, conservative and sensible citizen, and a long tried and untiring worker for clean government and honept politics. tnder the title "New Wine in Old Rottles."
