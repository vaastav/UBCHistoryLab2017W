Alabama and Mr. Underwood. The Alabama delegation in the House did a graceful thin* in indorsing Mr. I'nderwood for the presidency, and Mr. Vndenvood a most sensible thing in accepting the indorsement as a personal compliment In both performances runs the note of sincerity. As a truly national figure. Mr. I'nderwood is young; being -only about a year obi !Us services in the House had long born useful, but not until it was known that the republican supremacy had been overthrown and that the new House would be organized by the democrats did the gentleman from Alabama rome fully Into tbe spotlight. Democratic supremS'-\ in that body meant Mr I'nderwood for leader, and then the country began to take hi- measure. A- a presidential figure-made so by th f old folks at home?Mr. I'nderwood is opl\ about six months old. After he had shown his mettle at the extra session, en ! demonstrated that he was both leader pd ! irmopjzer. rnmpliments from all around poured In. and in Alabama they p. ve a new turn to thought As this man had done -o well in the place of House lender why would he not do well as lead, r in the "White House? Besides, as there was so much talk about this being the smith's opportunity, why should not Mr I'nderwood. of southern birth, rearing and residence, stand forth as the mail ? At fifty a political leader is reckoned as young Mr. I'nderwood will have rrn lied that mark before the democratic national convention meets. Hp is young. With youth go impulsiveness and eagerness Ordinarily such a compliment as has been paid Mr. Underwood by his colleagues would stir a young man to artlon. TT.it the present leader of the House is r<>! impulsive. In truth, that fact explains his leadership. He is a man of raTeulatinn Had he not been, he cotild r.pver have piloted his party through the difficulties of the extra session. His task *:heri called for a calm vision and a single purpose. Had he been a spellbinder and a soatterer he would have wasted his opportunity. Were Mr. Underwood to set his heart on the White House and maneuver for a stay under that famous roof he would play hobs with all the reputation he has Just acquired. His vision would become confused, and evervt^ng would go by the board. He could not serve two masters. and bis work In the House has the first and highest claim on his attention. Tliis does not mean that Mr. Underwood's name will, as the result of his reply to his House colleagues, disappear froai the presidential speculation. Of course it will not. It is there to stay, with the other names now on many pens and tongues. The matter of the nominee Is in the lap of fate, and we shall all have to wait for the decision. Detective Burns. Detective Burns is in danger of losing some of the prestige which he gained through the confession of the McNamara brothers and the consequent vindication of his course in their prosecution for the I.os Angeles dynamiting. It was quite natural after the dramatic denouement last week for him to speak exultantly, though in fact no words from him were necessary, for hroughout the country his praises were loudiv sounded immediately. Ever since the confession, however, he has been ta'king. endeavoring to persuade the public :hat the guilt of the McNamaras had been known to certain leaders of labor. His controversy with Samuel (lompers ha? become a bitter personal wrangle, with the detective making threats ar.d dropping pointed hints of accusations to come and the labor leader answering in kind with an anger perhaps justifiable. The catching of the McNamaras and the securing of evidence sufficient to force them into a confession to save their necks was a clever and valuable piece of work, for which the law-abiding citizens of this country a? e today profoundly grateful to the detective, so far as he has been instrumental to this end- But there is other work to do, the nature of which \f f Pnmv hfic himcolf wlntnli* i-1 . ? * * -J ?muivuitu in t^p course of his numerous talks for yrolication, and the prosecution of that whrk is surely not aided by the injection ofj.bitter personalities into the case or .constant clamoring of the detective ac^nst one particular leader of labor.

"But you've been on a journey sounding sentiment about the presidency, haven't you?" "Yes." .t'And returned without information? Tut, tut, colonel. What are you giving viy You are no 'farmer.' " ^'True. boys, and because of that fact 1 tn not deceived as to the value of th< information I acquired. It's not worth circulating.'' "But you gathered some information, didn't you? I<et us have it." "Well, strictly on the quiet. I can t^ll you the prices at the best bars in Charleston. New Orleans. Galveston, Omaha and [Denver. but next to nothing as to representative sentiment in those localities about the presidency." "But you tried to And out?" T did rnr beat I behaved my pret tlest. I went to the bottom of my pocketbook in my strivings to please." "And failed?" "Absolutely." "Well, tell us about that. It must be a difficult problem that baffles an experienced man like yourself, colonel." "Boys, the cards, south and west, are stacked against the inquiring stranger. As much curiosity is felt about him as he feels about local sentiment. I detected a conspiracy to swap jolly for liquor and cigars. Somehow I was suspected of being in the pay of Wall street, and offers to treat were thought to be in my line. At the taverns I got the sort of talk the loafers thought I'd best enjoy. At. the clubs I found a Hftle more ceremony, but no more information. 'What is the talk in New York and Washington?" was often the reply to my question, 'What is the talk down here?' " "And they stood you off?" "In as fine style as ever was done anywhere. Boys, we are a little 'nutty' in these parts about the boys in those parts.

And particularly at this time, when visitors of a curious turn are flush, and the way to the bar is short and so easily found." "But they are not indifferent as to next year?" "Say. you don't know how funny that question is. They are wild on the subject. To a man, they are convinced that a democrat will succeed Mr. Taft in the White House. And it is that conviction that makes them cautious. Of course they have their preferences, but, at last, the main thing with them is to have a man of their own party at the helm. They have been at sea dnd in rough water so long they yearn for Snug Harbor once more." "Then you have no predictions to make?" "None. And I don't give a rap?1 reject the other word for politeness' sake?for the prediction of the man who knows no better than to predict at this time." A Typical Bureau Problem. The paymaster general of the navy states a not uncommon case in his annual report in noting the fact that there are not enough clerks on the rolls of his bureau to do the work properly, and furthermore that they are not paid enough to keep them in service when they are efficient. One consequence is that former clerks of his bureau are scattered through other departments where, by reason of the training they had in the navy pay office they are now holding responsible and highly paid positions. The chief of the bureau must fill up the ranks from time to time with new appointees to take the places of the competent men who secure transfers into offices where they have better chances for promotion. In the same way many of the most efficient clerks in the government offices leave the public service for private employment because of the better pay they can command outside, not to speak of the increased chances of rising in the scale. Under the present system of departmental organization there is little incentive for the competent clerk to remain in the government employ. Again the contrast between the American and British systems is in evidence. In England every government employe is encouraged to remain in the service and particularly in his own bureau. He is assured, wherever he may he employed, of a competent salary and an annual promotion. There are no "soft places" in that service to tempt 1 clerks to secure transfers. The same scale of pay prevails in most of the offices as regards similar lines of work, and the annual increments or promotions are practically identical. There is no competition between bureaus for the services of the more efficient workers. Such a condition as that which Paymaster General Cowie cites is unheard of in the British public service, which is unquestion- j ably superior in point of effectiveness and competence to that of the I'nited States. Evidence continues to accumulate from all sides that the business of this government is suffering because of two conditions, the maintenance of a pay scale that is fifty years out of date, and the failure to adopt a method of departmental retirement permitting regular promotions through the successive release of the elder workers from active duty. Secretaries and chiefs of bureaus are almost unanimous in their recommenoations that more pay be given, and that some method be adopted to relieve the departments of the congestion caused by the humane retention of the veteran clerks who have passed the period of their greatest usefulness and are on the decline, and who, in sheer self-preservation, cling desperately to their places. Considered from the point of view of the public welfare, without any reference to the personal deserts of the clerks themselves, an immediate increase in the pay scale and the adoption of a method of departmental retirement is urgently required. The men who are expected to give an accounting for the MdNamara fund may feel something of the punctilious anxiety which sometimes attends the task of explaining campaign contributions. Rudyard Kipling is fortunate in the fact that there is a large reading public that delights to buy poetry which makes them indignant. And it will be remembered that Representative X1ck Kongworth has proved himself something of a political prophet. France doubtless regrets that Detective Burns is so busy that he cannot be borrowed to look up the Mona L?isa. Just now China Is keeping Wu Tingfang busy answering questions instead of asking them. Marching Through Georgia. What is the matter with Georgia? What Bort of politics may that brand be which is found in the Crgcker state? i A few years ago Hoke Smith was elected governor after a hot fight for t lie nomination, and upon taking office found an Inconspicuous man of the name of Brown serving as a railroad commissioner. He and Mr. Brown did not hit it off very well, and Gov. Smith ^removed Commissioner Brown. I Mr. Brown, in the language of the i street, took his medicine with good grace, and In his private office began keeping tab on the new regime. It occurred to him that, with such a start. Gov. Smith might not give the state a popular administration. Such proved to be the case: and when the time came Mr. Brown, encouraged by : expressions .of discontent with the gov ernor, offered for the place and defeated the man who had sent him to Coventry in the matter of the railroads. Gov. Brown, the rejected stone, succeeded Gov*. Smith > and became chief' of the corner. The defeated man took his medicine t with good grace, and began keeping tab ' on Gov. Brown. When the time came, 1 encouraged by expressions of discontent with the Brown administration, former > Gov. Smith fixed upon himself as the proper man to succeed the man who had I succeeded him, and the people at the polls - ratified his judgment. Gov. Brown step> ped down, and Gov. Smith ag^in stepped up. i Then came the death of Senator Clay, and Gov. Smith offered for the vacancy, and had the strength to secure the office. For the vacancy thus created in the , v governorship, former Gov. Brown of- ' fered. and although opposed by two strong men?one of whom was supported by Senator Smith?was nominated, and now awaits certain election. In January the people will return him to the office from which they displaced him for Gov. 8mith, whose advice they have Just rejected as to the man they should choose for the succession. I Head the summary of the record: Smith versus Brown In the matter of the railroad commissionershlp. Smith successful. Brown .versus Smith in the matter . of the governorship. Brown successful. Smith versus Brown in the matter of a . second try at the governorship. Smith " successful Smith, indirectly, versus i Brown in tho matter'of the third try by, Brown for the governorship. Brown successful. i" Mr. Smith is in the Senate, having readied the plare from the governorship. Will Gov. Brown develop senatorial aspirations. and when the time comes oppose Mr. Bacon? Is it all to en?J with Senator Smith escorting Senator-elect Brown down the main aisle of the Senate chamber to the clerk's desk to be sworn in? Are they in that way to be united and live happily ever afterward? The Capture of Fugitive Criminals. Fugitive^ from justice find the world growing steadily smaller, with fewer hiding places. Organization of police agencies has been effected until it is prac11??11? X ? ? 11?*- e* ? man.) iiupu^^ioip ior a person wno ts nee- j inp from one Jurisdiction to find refuge in t another. A virtually perfect system of a communications lias been established s whereby law officers keep one another in- ' formed of their needs and the identity of ^ those who are accused of crime. For example, the Washington police have just J been notified that a certain man and ' woman are "wanted" at Birmingham, 8 Kngland, on a charge, of fraud. Full de- , scriptions are furnished, and thus in a v few days from the time of flight every f policeman in Washington will he on the ? lookout , for these offenders. Similarly in s all other American cities and, doubtless, s cities of all other countries the police will r be notified of the appearance and habits of the fugitives and their arrest in a short time becomes probable. With the aid of the camera and scientific methods of iden. tification the chances of a fugittve to es- ' cape detection are brought to such a low point that flight is with only rare exrep- ^ tions futile. This result has been accomplished through intelligent co-operation between police headquarters, another in- T stance of the efficiency of organization. 1 Of course, now and then a criminal makes ' his escape, and by changing his appear- 0 ance Is able to elude detection for years. c Now and then the police utterly lose track ' forever of fugitive offenders, as in a cer- 1 tain notable local instance needless to re- r peat. But such cases are extreme excep- 8 tions. The rule of today is that a man r who commits a crime is almost certain -H to be caught, no matter if he should evade ' immediate arrest, as long as his identity t Is known. In such cases as the Mickle f murder, where there is no assurance of Identity, the problem is of a different ' character. If the man who killed Mickle j were actually known to the police, he i would in all probability be caught, no ' matter whither he might flee. j ' * i Sarah Bemhardt's positive statement s that she is not cherishing any intentions in the way of matrimonial alliances does , not imply any development of indiffer- 1 ence to theatrical engagements. < _ ^ < i A creation called "the whisky sandwich" has been discovered in Atlantic < City.

At first ' this sounds like a hard fate. And yet many of us have to endure it.

DEPARTMENT CLE AND II V Oreat Britain has been examining canlidates for appointment in the civil service since May 21, 18S5, on Uivil which date was issued the first "order in council" preoenncc. acrjbing tests to ascertain he qualifications of persons seeking? or iroposed for appointments, and regrulatng the conduct of the civil estabtishnents and the conditions of service in hem. This order was modified and exended by successive further orders from ime to time as conditions in the depart nents changed, and particularly as the lecessity developed of applying the merit >rinciple to newly created branches of the iervice. On the 1<>th of January. 1010, the atest order was issued, consolidating all receding regulations and virtually writng a new civil service rule for the Jnlted Kingdom, embodying all the surrlving features of the preceding orders. The civil aervlce commission conrii^s >f two officers appointed by "his majesty n council." That Is to say, these comnissioners are named by the ministry and lold their offices, during the pleasure of he king. This is tantamount to a life ippolntment. One of the commissioners Lets as the head of the commission and he other as an assistant, the two, howver, having virtually coequal powers and corking together as a unit. The present ommissioners are Mr. Stanley Mordaunt .eathes, first, and Mr. Herbert Woodleld Paul, second. Mr. I-ieathes had been ccond commissioner for some years and vas advanced to the first position in 1010 ipon the retirement of I?rd Francis Her^ey, who had served as second commlsioner from 1R02, and first commissioner rem 1007. Thus it is to be noted that n the maintenance of the commission Itelf the principle of retention governs, econd commissioners becoming firsts In >rder to preserve a virtually unending halti of experience In office. * * * The civil service occupies a large nodern building within convenient range of all the government lommission's offices just off Piccadilly nm and Regent street. There are sixty-nine on the egular administrative staff, but the special examiners for particular subjects lumber several score in addition.

UVVOOIUJ1 Uk UllC UI ? '" - J - I he civil service commission about two ;core of women and girls were waiting it one of these doors. A placard on a bulletin board explained the occasion. An xamination was to be held shortly for mskilled positions In the Post Office Department. I ascertained later that there vere perhaps twenty places, and it was issured that there would be probably >i0. and perhaps even 500, candidates. The ?xamirtation for sucb a position would be ilmost elementary, end would extend Utile beyond the ascertainment of physical jualifications. The positions would pay lbout 30 to 25 shillings a week, and were sought with pitiful eagerness. Examinations are held from time to rime to ffil either vacancies then existing pr that are estimated as likely to occur within any period not exceeding six months after the commencement of the examinations, or such vacancies as mayoccur within not more than six months I from the date that the results of the ex-1 a ruinations are announced, as the head of the department may desire to have filled. Tt is possible in the English service to estimate very closely as to the number of vacancies, for the retirements are regulated in accordance with age, j and save for casualties the prospect of half a year is practically plain to the administrative chiefs. In this way the civil service commission can keep the rlericai demands of the departments well supplied, * * * Notice of an examination is given well in advance, with full details as to the scope, the position or poExamination sitions to be filled, the jg . markings to be allowed KlOtlCeS. and the qualifications. These notices are posted conspicuously throughout the United Kingdom and are closely watched by all classes of people. Fhe examinations themselves take place in various cities, such as London, Edinburgh. Dublin, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Leeds. Liverpool, Plymouth, Portsmouth, Aberdeen and Olasgow. The candidates must apply for admission to the pxamination about, three weeks in adrnno., oor ifvinv tn their cenerai ilualiti cation's and specifying the offices or positions for which they desire to be examined and the places at which they wish to take their examinations. As far as possible facilities are offered to all classes of the people to compete for the government places. The general qualifications governing the civil service examinations are that the person examined is within the limits of age prescribed for the situation or employment to which he desires to be admitted; that he is free from any physical defect or disease likely to interfere with the proper discharge of his duties; that his character Is such as to qualify him for the position or employment to which he may be appointed, and that he possesses all requisite knowledge and ability to enter upon the discharge of those duties. The limits of age are strictly prescribed and yet there are certain exceptions and allowances. For instance, persons who have served or are serving in the army or the navy may If older than the limit deduct from their actual age any time that they may have served. Similarly, persons who have served or are serving in any of the militia organizations may deduct the time for which they have rereived army pay. The age limits are as a rule low, it being the object of the government to fill the ranks in the lower positions with young people scf as to retain them in service as long as possible and thus to give the administration the benefit of their accumulated experience. Tlius again does the English system differ strikingly from the American. Candidates for clerkships of class 1 must have attained the age of twentytwo years and must not have passed the age of twenty-four on the 1st day of August in the year in which the examination is held For certain miscellaneous positions such as junior appointments in the supply and acTHE MESSAGE.

HERE I GREAT BRITAIN I f counting; department.", the ecclesiastical commission and the royal ordinance factories the limits are from eighteen to nineteen and one-half years. For clerkships for the second division the limits are from seventeen to twenty years. For assistant clerks for the 'abstractor" class the limits are from nineteen to twentyone years. For female typists in all the departments the limits are from eighteen to thirty years, this heing one of the widest ranges In the subordinate service. In some of the special places requiring technical or scientific or other expert qualifications the limits are wider than in the ordinary clerical lines. From eighteen to twenty-four years is approximately the ranee within which the great majority of candidates enter the British service. Thus It Is possible for the average subordinate clerk to have reached his maximum of pay In forty years at about the time that he attains the age of sixty and Is eligible for retirement. The civil service commissioners proclaim in their general "abstract of rules and regulations" issued for the Information of the public that it Is not their practice to consider beforehand the question of physical qualifications. Cases in which doubts exist are decided Individually on their merits and no prospective decisions can be given. This warning is to prevent young men who have doubts themselves on this score from seeking to secure assurances from the appointing officers that they will be accepted if they pass the mental examinations. The commissioners warn Intending candidates that they may be rejected on physical grounds and suggest that they submit themselves to examination by preferably the medical adviser of the family or any othe>qualified practitioner to whojn certain points may be submitted. In the memorandum of warning arc noted certain diseases and disabilities which may bar the way to appointment. + * * The purpose of the commission is not j merely to exclude those who are imme-! dlately unfit, but to main-! Physical tain a high standard of j q. ,' , prospective health. The standard. maln obJectt indeed, of medical examination Is to secure continuous effective service and, in the case of candidates for permanent appointments, to prevent early applications for pension. Thus again does the British government try to organize and maintain its civil service upon the basis of permanency and stability, minimizing changes by every possible device. The applicant for civil service appointment in the British Isles must be a native-born or naturalized British subject. Otherwise, and within the limits of years and in the absence of obviously disqualifying physical defects, the examinations are open to all. In one important particular does the British civil service system differ from the American. There is ho geographical limitation whatever. The service is not split up into proportional patronage areas and squads, as in this country. In other wowls. there is ro ap-? portionment of offices law. The service | ?v,o Host- men whpther thev are I from Sheffield or London, from Cork or Brighton The residents of the capital suffer under no such handicap as that which virtually deprives the dwellers in the District of Columbia of any present participation in the activites of the federal government. * * Fees are paid to the government by all candidates for appointment to take the civil service examination Examination save in a few excepted p, cases. The scale of fees Lnarges. js changed from time to time, being published in the London Gazette, which is the government's official organ. The scale at present is as follows: When the initial salary or wage does not exceed the rate of ?50 per annum the fee is 1 shilling; when the initial salary does not exceed the rate of ?73 the fee Is 2 shillings R pence: above ?75 and under ?100, fee fi shillings; from ?i00 to ?130, fee 7s Rd; from ?150 to ?200, fee 10s>; from ?200 to ?230. 12s 6d; from ?250 to ?.'100, 15s; from ?300 to ?350, fee ?1; from ?350 to ?400, ?2; from ?400 to ?450, fee ?3; from ?450 to ?500. fee ?4: from ?500 to ?R00, fee ?3; from ?600 up-, ward, fee ?6 Candidates for temporary positions are not required to pay more than half the fees prescribed by the scale, provided they are not less than a shilling. Clerks seeking to pass from one grade to another in the same department must pay examination fees only corresponding to the differences between the salaries of the places held and those sought. When a clerk tries to pass from one department to another by way of an examination he must pay the full fee prescribed by the scale. * * * Practically all examinations embrace alternative or elective subjects, between which the applicant may Range of choose. The scope of each ? , . , examination is published in SUOjeCtS. advance, so that candidates may prepare themselves according to their particular special qualifications. Quite a wide range of selections is afforded. The total marks run into the thousands, to be made up by components of large denominations. The consequence is that the competition is especially keen in those examinations that include technical or literary subjects. In almost every examination for the clerical positions the line between success cuts finely, many a man being disqualified by the narrowest shade. There are usually several positions to be filled as the result of each examination, so that awards may go to several at the top of the list. Lists of successful competitors are made out in the order of merit up to the number required if w> many are found to be qualified. From these lists the civil service commissioners, on the application of the departments, may assign clerks for permanent or temporary service, assignment being, as a general rule, in the order of the names on the list, an older list taking precedence over a more recent list. This means that when once a candidate passes an examination he remains eligible for appointment until disqualified by some circumstance arising after the examination, and does not require to be appointed within a certain limit of time. Unassigned successful competitors who have shown special aptitude or qualifications may be assigned to any department ? ? . . _ wnere sucn amnties are m demand. Otherwise successful competitors are allowed, subject to the requirements of the service, to select the departments In which they wish to serve. But any successful competitor refusing service in the department to which he is assigned may be removed from the list. G. A.

In The Star of that date Is a brief report of the proceedings, Congress including the statement that the galleries, lobbies Meets. and all the approaches to the two chambers were densely crowded, indicating the intense public Interest felt in the proceedings. President Lincoln did not submit his annual message until the second day of the session, December .'t. in the issue of which day it is printed in full. In that message he declared that he was anxious and careful that the conflict for the suppression of the insurrection should not "degenerate Into a violent and remorseless revolutionary struggle." * * * Very early in the civil war citizens of the United States who traveled abroad had occasion to And a difForeign ference in the attitude of foreigners toward this govrrestlge. eminent, owing to the prevalence of the impression that a dissolution of the American Union was at hand. In The Star of December 4, 1861, is a paragraph bearing upon this point: "A very intelligent Maryland gentleman, who has always been a democrat, and in the tast campaign was an ardent Breckinridge man, was in this city last spring and was at that time one of the I most ultra-secessionists to be found. He shortiv afterward left hero for u Hiioinoca I tour through South America and returned a few days since. He is now in favor of preserving the Union at every hazard. When asked Vhat caused the change in his- views he replied that a few years since he was through South America, and, as a citizen of the United States, was everywhere treated with the highest consideration and respect. This time everything was changed. In every little state of Central and South America he was insulted and, wl?en he spoke of his nationality, was laughed- at and taunted with the rupture here. "You talk of the United States," said they; 'you have no country now; you who have been so boastful, you are no longer in a condition to fit out filibustering expeditions and* prey upon your weaker neighbors. You will soon be as weak as the weakest." Our friend was so forcibly struck with the contrast between his position as a citizen of the United States a few years since and now that bis views changed, and though formerly a strong states' rights man, he is now as strongly in favor of a consolidated government of the stiffest kind?anything strong enough to bind the states together." * * * The liquor question was seriously troublesome to the authorities in charge around Washington durLiquor inR the w?r. owing to the necessity of preventing Pro Diem. as j-ar as possible the sale of Intoxicants to soldiers. In The Star of December 4, 1W1, is a news paragraph telling of a characteristic occurrence in the course of the enforcement of the prohibition: "Since the District regiment. Col. Tait. has been assigned to duty on the line of the railroad from this city to a point near Beltsville the order in relation to selling liquor to soldiers has been strictly enforced. Yesterday morning an affair occurred at Bladensburg which fully convinced the dealers there that the "new guard was in earnest. Several officers of the District regiment went to Bladensburg to look for some of their men. and at Suit's tavern met a soldier of a Pennsylvania regiment coming out w.ith two canteens around his neck, which were filled with whisky. They took these to empty them, i which caused a scuffle, and the pro1 prietor called for his gun. One of the i officers promptly drew his pistol and, pointing it at the soldier, .fired, the hall passing through the man's cap. and the burning wad, sticking in his liair, burned his forelock and seared his forehead somewhat. The soldier was completely prostrated with fright, the man who called for his gun was threatened with death as soon as the gun arrived, and he was as badly scared as the soldier, and begged that nothing more would be done, and promj ised never to sell a drop to soldiers I again." * I * * In the Senate December 4, 1861, Senator Wilson presented a resolution, which was agreed to, instructDistrict inK the District committee to consider all laws In force reJail. lating to the arrest of persons as fugitives from service or labor, and also the expediency of abolishing slavery in the District, with compensation to loyal slaveholders. In the course of the discussion on this resolution and another which directed the liberation of certain negroes confined in the District jail the condition of that place of imprisonment was severely criticised. The Star of December 5, 1861, said. wiiii icicioiiic iu iiu? urudic. "The condition of the prison was very justly censured with great severity, with as much as that with which the grand jury for this county has censured it, term after term, for years past, in its customary presentments with reference to it. In thus censuring it the grand Jury has always taken occasion to point out the fact that Congress was justly chargeable with the responsibility for the shameful evils of which it complained. Not once, but twenty times in the last decade, has the grand jury besought Congress to make the necessary appropriation to enable the marshal of the District to make the Washington jail somewhat more comfortable and less deleterious to the health of those confined In it than 'an Austrian dungeon.' But it has always so appealed in vain. Now that the attention of so many senators is so zealously turned to the subject it is hoped that Congress will no longer leave it in its chronic deplorable condition." * * * In The Star of December 5, LS61. is the following brief announcement of the project which resulted in the Ford's construction of the theater in 10th street in which Theater. President Lincoln was shot a few years later: "A number of gentlemen, we have learned, united with Mr. John T. Ford of Holliday Street Theater in Baltimore to build a modern and elegant temple of the drama in our city. The location will be the site of the place now occupied by George Christy's minstrels, on 10th street. which is very centrally situated. The proposed building will in size, elegance and style be similar to Laura Keene s Theater in New York, and will seat as many auditors. It will be completed and opened early In the spring. Until the timbers are framed and everything is readiness to commence the new place the present building will be occupied by the Christy minstrels." A SAD

A Chinese statesman recently re-1 cl marlfced to a distinguished occidental:' "You are doing your j,, Critical possible to awaken China; | ;a T . once she is awakened a< Juncture. 8h#, wljj marCh ao quick-1l! ly that you will regret that you have troubled lier repose " From a monarcliy j{, to a democracy is surely a great leap, ai but the feat Is being performed in the Occident, why not in the orient? China is steering straight in this h moment for a republic. 81nce ai there has been in China, in Europr ' and America a Chinese revolutionary committee. And now the crisis has come. When Premier Yuan-Shi-Kai is confronted u by financial difficulties and an empty treasury; when victory of the revolu- j ^ tlonary army lias bred dissension and ! strife; when, according to a dispatch; from Hongkong, "the ship of state 1^',, sailing without chart or compass and f all on board are desirous of acting as captain"; we must know that the crisis has come and the hour of action awaited by the committee has struck. 1? The first to depart for the future rr field of operations is Fung-Chi-Yao. editor of the Chinese Free Press of, _ San Francisco. At Shanghai, we are a told, he tfill prepare place for the con - j if stitutional convention convoked hv the - w committee. Thence he will go to fan- ; ton as messenger to the leaders there. ; H Meanwhile the mysterious masters of : ,| this Chinese revolution are on the sea, j a ploughing the waters of the Indian ), ocean, due to arrive at Shanghai the y 15th instant. i p At Shanghai, become the capital of th?- r, Chinese republic, a provisional govern- ; ment will be established by order of and tl under the Chinese revolutionary comm.t- t? tee, which until now has had its head- p quarters In San Francisco, in New York, I/ondon, Paris and Berlin. The Chinese revolutionary- committee consists of the h Chinese Dr. Sun Yat Sen and the Amer- p lean Gen. Homer Ia?a. y, This douhle-barreled military govern- a ment appears upon the scene at an aus- i ^ picious moment. It carries with it a well I n filled war chest and its timely arrival. ! r aided by its printed proclamations to r army, press and people, will create not s only unity of action, but precipitate the H downfall and hopeless rout of the Man- j chu, with whom there is to he no truce i g or compromise. a * ' c * This Chinese government is to be in v force for three years. During this time Dr. Fun Yat Sen will be! j Three-Year charged with the civil af- ? P . , fairs of the country. Gen. f renoa. Homer Lea with the mili- a tary. In this interval the country will he s prepared for the American form of constitutional government with a president p and two elective assemblies. Dr. Sun Yat; a Sen may he the first president, and who | t knows? Mr. Wu Ting-fang, former Chi- ; nese minister at Washington, may follow. ' The North China Daily News, writing j of the regent, the functionaries and what , * it knows of what is going on in China, i exclaims: "The people have no confidence J in any of the revolutionary leaders, for none of them has shown any talent ex- : cept to obtain money."' I cite the fol-1 lowing note from Le Correspondent, in ' t which Mr. Charles Halcombe of Kent. ; 1 member of the "China reform party," an . t association in sympathy with the Chinese j j revolutionaries, writes: "One of the revo- j lutlonary chiefs writes me that he desires ' 3 to see England and China bound together 1 intimately." t The foregoing may signify nothing of r itself, but in connection with the recognition openly accorded certain Chinese revo- j lutlonary leaders in London It may have * significance which our department may ? do well to note. For example, I>ord Roberts is reported in the press as having c presided at a reception recently accorded j i one of the Vhinese revolutionaries in c London. Lord Charles Beresford was n likewise present. ii I should state that the same official t was In Washington, but he was not given a so much recognition or encouragement, fc which from a governmental point of view \ ^ is unfortunate. A major general certain- j t ly might have been sent ex officio to pay ' c his respects without committing the gov- i f ernment in any way. The Chinese (old i r system) provide against oversights of ! p such a nature by maintaining a depart- < j. ment of "rites and ceremonies." It is in ^ the memory of all that Mr. Cleveland a when President came near failing to visit i c the Infanta Eulalie when that lady visit- j ed Washington, and all because of the r lack of a protocol chief or a department x of rites and ceremonies. t *' r * * I We are told in the China journals t that there is a dearth of leaders among * the revolutionaries. Per- \ ^ Leaders baps both Dr. Sun Yat ' n Y ? Sen and Gen. Homer Lea i r acKmg. are not of that min<j ' 3 Flrat there is Yuan-Shl-Kai. who, 1 rightly or not, has placed himself in the front rank. But Yuan is manifest- j ly the wrong man In the wrong place, t He is loudly acclaimed as a reformer, but he carefully abstains from placing i himself in the ranks of the revolution- I aries. It is the hour of revolution in I r China, and reform must wait upon the I revolution. I ? Yuan has had ample opportunity to I carve out his fortune, perhaps obtain 1 the throne, to which he aspires, but he is manifestly afraid of the sword. 11 There is something in the attitude of ? this much vaunted soldier that recalls the figure of Gen. Bourn of the army r, of I^a Grande Ducliesse de Gerolstein, I immortalized by Offenbach. While I am writing this a dispatch lb from Peking, dated December 6, an- M nounces that Yuan has obtained the r< abdication of Prince Chun, regent, who si is succeeded by Shih-Hsu, a Manchu si prince, who is to rule cojolntly with p Hsu Shih-Chang, a Chinese, formerly s< vice president of the privy council. In- m fortunately for Yuan, the compromise d< is tardy, and will not be accepted by the revolutionaries. Its only iin- ii portance lies In the fact that it may a; serve to constitute Yuan-Shi-Kai the I ei recognized chief of a Manchu-Chinese ' "< party. But even if Yuan was a soldier, jet which may be doubted, he has no money tr to pay his soldiery, and this fact we tc may be sure is being already communi- a.< cated by the messenger who has pre- ai ceded the revolutionary committee. The kl eyes of all China, then, will be turned th toward Shanghai to greet the arrival of the Chinese committee, the rising sun aj of China. to Next among the revolutionary leaders is di Gen. Li Yan Hong, who is commander-in- at chief of the revolutionary army in the si field. He has achieved considerable sue- ai cess and he has, singular to relate, proROCKEFELLER'S
