FUOM WASHINGTON. [Special to tue Courier-Journal.] Wasm sorox. De •. 9.—Mr. Eandall, of t'ennsj l vania. made à very severe onslaught on the President s message to-day, wherein it •was attempted to whitewash the late Board of Public Works. Tie - President had attempted to convince Congress that Boss Shepherd and lus associates had n<>t incurred a debt exceed ing $10.INK),000. Mr. liandiill to-day took up the figures luruisi.ed by th'- Board of Audit, which demon*»: te that the District debt really exceeds >2' ,000,000. The special cham pion of th<- tre-iden', little Hide, of Maine, attempted to reply to Mr. iî-.tndu ll, but it was an utter failure, * lUndall asserted that he lad the otiieial t.v res for the statement made by him, and lied .led anybody to demonstrate his inacnracy, Mr. Hale, having charge of the resolution which a thirds the opportunity for Mr. llaudah's attack, called the previous .question, aiidthu- '»oil all further debate. 'Ire not lieing aide to answer the facts as pre sented gainst th Pr. dib nt, therefore pur sued the only w. y to stop unpleasant dis closnresJ which -, to choko Mr. Bandall off. As was very pertriiuiitiy remarked, the time is coming when the truth can't be suppressed, <iEXKj;\i, it::' oxsTnrcTiox of thk south. It is also believed that the subject will come up in some way or other in Congress, tnd will probably kad to a debate in which many ol the issues of lire last general elec tion will be review d. Tliere are very decided indications also tl at the Bepublican Congress men here are seriously alarmed at the pros pect of a large Southern Democratic vote for President in IST* , and are resolved to take as nan y Southern States as possible by the throats, and so reconstruct and annnl their State Governments as to tix their vote two years hence to an absolute certainty. Louisi ana, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi, are all believed to be in danger from these des perate conspirators. Their object is to carry the Presidential election, whether by lair means or foul: and to this end everything else will be subordinated. THE 

FINANCIAL QUESTION. There was some collision to-day between ;he Ways and Means Committee and that on Banking and Currency, as to which should have control of the question of the volume of legal tenders and the resumption of specie pay ment, winch was discussed in the President's message; Lu! it was finally agreed that both committeei should deal with the subject in their own way. Private ti uancial advices from New York suite that the President's message exerted no influence whatever on values, and that the fall in gold is due altogether to im proved advices man Great Britain. Bankers .here laugh at Grant's idea ol naming an early day for resumption. »».Knits! IIP OF THE

A FACT OB A FICTION FROM FLORIDA. [From the New York Times.] An old lawsuit has come to an untimely end in Florida. During the war, when the 'Federal fleet was menacing Tampa Bav, a certain Fred. Halsemann, an old planter of Hillsboro county, anxious, like the reet of his trilie, to be "let alone," thought that the famous everglades would be the safest place to stay, and accordingly disappeared into their tangled recesses. He took with him his wife and their youngest child, a boy live years old. The wife and mother got sepa rated in some way from the two others, and luck ily happened to wander back to her home. Three years went by. The war was over. The older sons had returned from service in the Confeder ate army and were working the plantation on shares with their former slaves. During all this time nothing had been heard of the missing pair. They were mourned for as dead. tine day, in the spring of 1807, a man appa rently about thiitv years old, leading by the hand a boy of live, ran joyously up to the verandah of the plantation house, and began a series of vio lent kirsings ot the aged mother in Israel, who, with the aid of large type and spectacles, was reading her Bible there'. His demonstrations of affection were interrupted by the screams of the old lady and the blows of the eldest son. Both struck the intruder painfully. He tried to speak, but was obliged to »levote all his energies to the task of finding a soft spot to fall upon at the end of the parabola which the son's last well-aimed blow marie him describe in the air. He ros', be wildered and bruised, just in time to be knocked down again by a select assortment of younger sons and negroes, whom the sound or the scullle bad called to the spot. As ho fell, something tumbled from the pocket of his ragged coat. It was a picture of the widow. The dead planter had carried it with him when he plunged into the swamps. There was a general outcry, and a demand for aa explanation. The story* of the new comer was in brief, this : He was Fred. Halsemann. Iu his wanderings through his vast hiding-place he hud fallen into a foaming spring. When he clambered out, his son ran away, as if in fright. He ran alter him with surpris'mg speed, ihe chilu, when caught, screamed for its father. It was long before lie could be persuaded that the young, fresh, vigorous man who climbed out of the spring was the aged, decrepit, white-haired man who had fallen into it a moment before. The lather at first could not appreciate the change. He saw that his bands were no longer wrinkled, that his beard was brown 'instead of gray, that his step was firmer and his eye keener, but the suddenness of the tr&nformation dizzied him. All at once the truth Hashed upon him. He had fallen into the Fountain of Truth which Ponce do Leon sought in vain amid the Florida swamps ! He hastened back and ptnngod his son into the spring. It was an unlucky deed. The tradition about the fountain has always been that its wonderful waters changed age to vigorous manhood and maile ulready-existent youth immutable so long as life lasted. The t i-adition proved true. He hatl become young. His son stayed so. The boy was five years old when tlie potent waters touched him, aud ho showed no signs of giowtli beyond that age, in mind or body, »luring the three years they spent l ost in the labyrinth. They lived mainly bn alli gators, which, when young, are very good eating. When they killed an old one it was their custom to plunge it, while a spark of life was still leit, into the Fountain of l'cuth. Thus it became young again, and their fastidious palates were satisfied. Finally, after many vain attempts, the two got cut of the wilderness in which they had been so long lost. Tlu-y happened to come out near the old Imme, aud hastened to it. This was the man's story. It is not to be won dered at. perhaps, that he told it to a cirole cf scoffers. Tlie picture was taki-n from him. His accurate recollection of the life of the missing planter was accounted for on the hypothesis that lie had met lum iu the swamps and had heard tire details from his lips. He was accused of stealing the picture. It Degan to be whispered that he had probably murdered Halsemann. He was told to go. He went, taking the boy with lrim. He reappeared in a week afterward, at Tampa, alone. The child, he said, had died of n ight and want. He began suit for possession of the Halsemann plantation. When the trial came off he rested Ins case on three points : The resemblance of tlie boy to the child vlio had dis appeared in lttil : his own ready recollection of tno miuutnc of Halsemann's life, ami lus ability to pilot anybody to the Fountain of Ponce De Leon. The first two points were admitted, but the re semblancu vas attributed by tire defense to a chance coincidence, and the" knowledge of the past, to a presumed intimacy between the planter aud the pretender, while both were lost m ever glades. When men meet each other, under such circumstances, they tell everything. The most trivial details are eagerly related aud heard for the sake of wilding away the monotonous hours. So the argument ran, fairly enough. The third point was rtatly denied. Acting on a suggestion of the court, the claimant went with a large party iu search of the miraculous spring. After some weeks of wandering, they came back without having found it. Still this failure did not absolutely disprove the claim. The most practiced wooils meu have often gone astray iu Southern Florida. When the case went to a jury, the latter disa greed. So did the next one impaneled, aud tlie jiext. The last of the three, however, came very near giving a verdict for the plaintiff. This was mainly due to the admirable manage ment of his counsel at that time, lion. John A. Henderson, the Democratic candidate for Con gress at the recent election. The claimant's gratitude to Henderson was the indirect cause of lus death. This occurred ou the 3d of Novem ber. During the acuffio at tlie polls, whore he was distributing Democratic ballot*, he was shot through the body. Somebody lifted his head. He gasped, " I am—and died. The present possessors of the estate, whose title has been settled by his death, aver that at the last moment remorse overtook him, and he tried to say. "I am not Halsemann." but was too weak to finish the sentence. On the other baud, his friends declare that with his last breath he asserted the justice of his claim, by trying to say,"I am Hal-emanu." This, however, is ail conjecture. The puzzle re mains without an answer : Was he Halsemann, or was he some other man ? The finest glassware iu the city, cheap, atNav ra's, 174 Canal street.

Un like pew-holders, these owners of seats will have no voice in the management of the establish ment ; though we should be delighted to learn that one of the privileges of the hi tie estate is a right to hiss, whenever the doings behind the curtain really demanded hissing.

We suffer ourselves to be bored to the very verge of deliquium ; we stand had nflisie, bad music, bail acting, and bad lecturing with a pa tience which doesn't argue so much our polite ness as our phlegm.

Boron os the Deacon. -A certain deacon, who was a zealous advocate for the cause of tem perance. employed a carpenter to make some alterations in his parlor. In repairing a corner near i he fire-place it was found necessary to re move the wainscott, when lo! a "mare's nest" was brought to light, which astonished the work men most marvelously. A brace of decanters, sundry junk bottles—all containing "something to take" a pitcher and tumblers, were cosily re posing there iu snug quarters. The joiner, with wonder-stricken countenance, ran to the propri etor with the intelligence. "Well,I declare," ex laimed the deacon, "that is curions sure enough. It must be that old Capt.
