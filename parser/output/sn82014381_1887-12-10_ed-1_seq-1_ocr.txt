Kt'l>ul>lii :iti- In Congress to Attack the Tobacco Tax at Once. [Copyrijltt, IS>7, by the California. Associated J'r'ia. [ Washington, December 9th. — It is re ported that a resolution will he introduced in the House at an early date by a promi nent Republican for the repeal of the to bacco tax. This resolution, if not smoth ered by the Ways and Means Committee, will be pressed for consideration as rapidly as possible! and passed, with the expectation that the President, in view of his message, may veto it. The whole question of the propriety of abolishing internal taxes be fore reducing customs duties will thus be brought up for discussion. 

11LAINES ANSWER To the President's message, as contained in his Paris interview with the New York Tribune correspondent, is accepted as the joinder of the issue on the tarill question with Cleveland. That Blame will receive the Republican nomination at Chicago on June 19th is regarded as a foregone con clusion. The Star to-ni^ht says : " His opponents, while privately expressing doubts as to his strength, particularly in New York, appear to have no hopes of stemming the tide that has set in his favor. Every political move seems to turn in his direction, so far as the nomination is concerned. His strength in New York is questioned by many. It is said that the stalwart element in that State, though quiet at present, is as strong as ever, and will be as potent against Mr. Blame on election day : that he will have the same opposition to contend with that confronted him in 1884, and that his chances of carrying that State will be lessened by meeting this time with a united Democracy, strengthened by Cleveland's administration. Buteventhis, it is thought, will be powerless to defeat him in Convention, and it is claimed for him by his friends that, with the platform he has laid down for himself, he can carry Virginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Alabama. The Democrats concede that he could carry Virginia by a Inr^re majority, should the Democrats in the House fail to repeal the tobacco tax, and he would stand the same chances un der those circumstances ia North Carolina." 

BLAINE'S PCBI'OSK. Cleveland* Message Causes Him to Ma- terially Change His Plans. London, December 9th. — Friends of Blame have asserted that he had, until the publication of the President's message, given up all idea of becoming a candidate, upon the ground that he did not believe the Republican party could succeed. Upon the direct issue of free trade and protection he, however, believes the Republicans can carry New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and In diana. He has had a number of consulta tions with friends since the appearance of Cleveland's message, and it was upon his resolution to again permit his name to be used as a candidate that he once more de clared himself in his home organ as an un swerving advocate of the protection theory.

NEEDED REFORM. Senator Stanford's Proposed Correction of the Naturalization Laws. [Copyright, IS.^7, by Uie California Asst-cialcd Pros.! Wasiii.-u;ton, December Oth. — Senator Stanford will a bill in Congress, at the first opportunity, to amend the naturalization laws 90 as" to provide that no person immigrating from a foreign Jcoun try to the United States can become a citi zen until after a residence of twenty-one years in the land of his adoption. Mr. Stanford thinks that men of foreign birth should pass through the same period of probation before becoming citizens as is exacted of the sons of Americans by birth. No man born in this country can be a voter until he has reached the ape of twenty -one years. Foreigners who may be unable to either speak or write the Eng lish language, can come to the United States under the existing laws, and after live years' residence become voters and citizens, having made the necessary previous declarations. LAMAE. Tlie Ex-Secretary Certain to be Confirmed as Associate Supreme .Justice.

Lamar, Vilas and Dic.Wn soq, nominated to be respectively Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. Secretary or tin? Inferior and Postmaster-General. "Mr SACRAMENTO, SATURDAY MORNING, DEC EMBER 10, 1887. Lamar made quite a number of enemies as Secretary of the Interior, on account of his decisions against wealthy corporations, and they would like an opportunity to knife him. They will not have this opportunity, as Senators Stanford and Stewart have de clared their intention of votimr for him, and there will be others injthe Republican camp who will stand by him. No objec tion is urged against the confirmation of either Vilas or Dickinson. WHAT THE! SAY. Democratic and Republican Journals' Comments on Bluiue'H Interview. New York. December 9th. — In com menting on Blame's message, the Ti>ne? says: "This, then, is the sum of Maine's policy, and as he is the leader of the Republican party at pres ent, it must be taken as the poiny ot the Republicans until they repudiate it, and it would be well for them to hasten to do it. It is not a policy that it can go before the country with." The Tribune says: "Blame in Europe speaks as an American. Cleveland in America speaks as a British manufacturer, anxious to be admitted without any charge to a sLare of the best aud largest market in the world." The World a&yt: "The Maine statesman's interview is, in fact, a proclamation that Blame considers himsf-if to be the chesen champion of protection, and that he is ready to enter the Presidential list again as such. President Cleveland stands for this purpose. Blame comes forward as a champion of the opposite idea. The Dem ocratic party could not ask for a better is sue." The .Sim says: ''If brother Blame enter tains such loose notions of the relation be tween the Federal Government and States, it strikes us that he would be a conspicu ously until person to intrust with the man agement of the nation's financial affairs.

Decjmber 9th.— Reports show that previous reports of damage by this weeks rain-storm in Oregon ar.d Washing ton Territory have been exaggerated. The Northern Pacific line between here and'fa coma, which was reported washed out for a section of twenty-five miles, is in running order to-day. The track was submerged in a few places, but the water subsided last night. The Oregon Railroad and Navigation line has suffered no damage. The Narrow gauge lost one small bridge. The principal loss is in logs, which were carried out of the small streams into the Columbia river and lost. This loss is variously estimated at from $30,000 to ;£50,000. No damage has been done in this city. There are very light rains to-day, and the water is subsiding in all directions. OUEtiON. An Kfl'ort to Have Villard's Projected Portland Hotel Completed. f Copyright, 18S7, by lf,c California Associated iVctt.l Portland, December 9th.— A meeting of citizens was held to-day to consider a measure looking to the completion of the hotel begun here four years ago by Henry Villard on the block bounded by Morrison", Yanibill, Sixth and Seventh streets. It is opposite the PostolHce. A proposition was submitted offering Mr. Villard a bonus or $150,000 to complete the building « ing to the original plans, and to furnish and operate it as a first-class hotel. The proposition is also open to any other per son or corporation. It is understood that Villard has tacitly promised to use his best efforts to secure the completion of the ho tel. There was subscribed to the fund at the afternoon's meeting $52,000, and it is be lieved that the entire amount can be raised within a week. Why We ll.vvi: Choueea. — In spite of the remarkable success of sanitary poli cing in the suppression of Asiatic cholera in Calcutta — or possibly because of that success?— the local Commissioners of health have actually dismissed the corps of sani tary inspectors that were employed a year ago at the solicitation of their Health Offi cer, Dr. Simpson, who complains bitterly in his late report of this glaring exhibition of indifference and stupidity. As Calcutta and its region are the grand fount and ori gin of this world-devastating plague, it he comes an international question, and the right of every country to demand of the Government that lias assumed control of that region to use all possible means to stamp out the infection at its fountain head. It would be eminently fit, and per haps effectual, for other countries to place an embargo on the commerce of Calcutta in their ports until this obvious duty of its authorities should be recognized. The experience reported in the above-cited pas sage from our files abundantly proves that the extinction of Asiatic cholera is within the power ol the British authorities in In dia. The Hotel in Yosf.mite.— J. J. Cook, lessee of the Stoneman Hotel, accompanied by D. F. Baxter, arrived in the city last Saturday. They left Yosemite on Tuesday, the 129 th nit Four inches of snow had fa'len in the valley the first day of the gtorrn, and at Tamarack Station and other points on the summit it was eight inches in depth. A private letter from Wawona, under date of Monday, December sth, saya the storm had compelled a temporary sus pension of work on the Chilnualna'trail, which will probably be left in an unfin ished condition till spring: but the bridge above the upper fall will undoubtedly be completed this season. The weather'has cleared up, and the snow was rapidly dis appearing. Mr. Cook trot all his furniture into the hotel just ahead of the storm. The water supply pipe is laid, and even-thing in and about the hotel is ready for the re cepiinn of guests when the tourist season commences. — ;>'. F. Call.

The bamboo is green and fresh from the sea-girt county.

A Sheep Slaughter.— Last Tuesday, during the heavy storm, a portion of the fence on the railroad near Whitney's Station, Placer county, was in some manner thrown down, and a band of aheep belonging to J.

During the night a train came along, and now Mr. Whitney mourns the loss of 170 sheep. The entire track from one end of the cut to the other was bespattered with blood and wool, and presented a very san guinary appearance.

Dr. Storrs' paper on " The Necessity of Co-operation now in Christian Work,"' was read by Dr. Chamberlain of Brooklyn, Dr. Storrs being 111.

The bible, the Sabbath and liberty of conscience must be defended. In the West, in small towns several churches, by their competitons, af ford a spectacle to make thedevil laugh and angels weep, and in citiesthe need of union is equally great.

December !»lh— The report of Captain Bunce. commanding the cruiser Atlanta, and the indorsement of the Bu reau officers of the Navy Department upon the subject, were made public to-day. The only new phase of the matter is "the in dorsement of Secretary Whitney, which disposes of the subject in the "following language : " The Department deems that t)je Atlanta shonid have some continuous service before the changes are made. The suggestions of Captain Bunce are valuable and entirely proper. Doubtless, without any expectation that comments upon the ship would be treated as anything else than professional discussions for the benefit of the depart ment in the future, many of the criticisms have been discussed heretofore, and some of her known defects were intentionally overlooked by her designers for the pur pose of securing benefits in other direc tions. Aside from the lack of speed, she represents a type with merits and defects, and the balance can be struck after she has had service. None of the alleged defects have been reproduced in subsequent ves sels now in course of construction." California Pensions.

The value ' of coflee in typhoid and malarial fevers J has been long known, but has been attrib uted to the tonic effects of the caffeine on ! the nervous system.

Seven or eight of them succeeded in getting over to Quebec yesterday, and have been loafing around in a most objectless manner through the streets, exciting general surprise and pity. The police finally had to arrest one man and two women for persisting in sitting down in doorways, impeding the ingress and egress.

Before they could be captured they got into a boat and were soon out of sight. If the men had fired the gun-cotton tank, the whole island would have been blown out of existence.

We cannot get Meady employment, and when we do wages are very poor indeed, and on the other hand provisions are bigh. !f a man gets forty cents a day for labor he is doing well, and $2 60 per week for the best labor is called high. In the cotton picking season this year we could only get thirty-live and forty cents a hundred. Every day our streets are crowded with forced idlers, and the county roads are ful! of people with their blankets on their backs trudging from place to place in search ot work. We heard of California. Some of our people can read, and a few California papers ft 11 into their hand's, anil the won derful things we read of made us beiieve that this was the land of promise.

I am very well known in that portion of the State by the colored people, and they unan imonsly agreed that I should go into this unknown country, that I should penetrate this far-famed paradise and report to them the result of my investigations. 'We were all poor, and how was I to get the money necessary to make the trip. I preached several sermons and took up collections, but the poverty of the people was such that it was impossible to ra ; se the funds necessary in this manner.

The families that I represent, and those tor whom I de sire to secure situations, aro first-class in every respect, honest, honorable and in dustrious. Those that are not are as well ofi in North Carolina as they aro here, and will never get to California fhrongh any assistance of mine. " How do I like California? Well, sir, the fondest dreams of my life are real ized. The paradise that has been written about is a perfect Eden. The climate, the coil, the productions and the people, from what I can see and learn are an improve ment on those of many other portions of the globe.

Wo can give you as good cooks, waiters, cab-drivo^, gardeners, field workers as the world can produce, f can and will vouch for their honesty and in tegrity. From what I have learned to-day I can see that there are openings for many Of my people who can fill places now occupied by the Chinese, and make for themselves from $1 to $1 50 per day, and others where they can get steady employ ment at from $40 to $50 per month and board.
