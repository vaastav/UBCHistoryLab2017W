CHIEF'S SALARY PLACED AT $1,800 AT BUSY ALDERMAN1C SESSION.1 Council Disposes Of Matters Of Importance. STREET AFFAIRS i An ordinance to fix the salary of, the superintendent of police at $ 1.800 was introduced at the council meet ing last night and, after having its 1 first reading, was ordered printed on slips. Just what Chief Burke's salary would be has been the subject of | much speculation, as under the new j police law the sergeants would re- i ceive a larger salary than the chief has been receiving, as the law does not refer to the chief. The ordinance regulating the sal \ ary of the recorder was amended dn Its second reading so as to make it | read $720 per yenr, instead of $600 us it was on the first. The ordinance 1 ) was then given its second and third readings. A payment of $4,369.34 was or dered to the Standard Bitbulithic Company who are the contractors for the Market street pavement. The committee on streets and sew ers to whom the petition to estab * I ( ? ? | Chief of Police Riirltc.

Martin j Hansen was given permission to move a two-story building from Smtih and Oak stret's to Grace street. Mr. Han sen said that he had received permis sion to use Market street from the Standard Bithulithic Company. A. F. Munoz was given permission to move a frame building from the old steamboat dock to 90 Second street. Mr. Munoz had neglected to name what streets he would traverse in moving the building, but Alder man Stacey said the structure was very small and could be moved on wheels. A petition for an arc lamp at the foot of Madison avenue was referred to (he committed on lamps and lights. The petition for a crosswalk at Kearny avenue and Harrison place, which had been referred to the com- ' mittee on strets and sewers, was re- I ported on favorably.

The committee on streets and sow ers of the Board of Aldermen, to whom had been referred the petition of Dr. Frank C. Henry to vacate the strip of land opposite the southern endof Oak street, reported unfavor ably on the petition at the council meeting last night. No reason was given for the action, although the two remonstrances received frorfi the Raritan Copper works and a number of property owners, respectively, may i have had some weight in the matter. 1 At the last meeting of the council, Judge Adrian Lyon spoke in behalf I of Dr. Henry and said that numerous i other streets have been vacated and i he could see no reason why this tract,' which is only (JO feet by 100 feet could not be. Mr. Lyon said that if Dr. Henry was given the land, he would pay the Market street i*ive ment assessment, and otherwise the city would have to pay if. In both Of the remonstrances the signers stated that 1he closing up of the strip of land would lessen the value of property nearby and also affect the manufacturing interests, should any other factories decide to locate In that vicinity. The land in question is between the two sections of the row of cot tages recently bought by Dr. Henry, and formerly known as the Lyle cot iages. ) FRIENDS OF CORDOVA WORKING TO SEGORE PARDON FOR HIM. ! i SOUTH RIVliR, Oec. 4:?It the friends of Frank Codrova, the un frocked pastor of a local church, whc was sent to state prison a year ago, for a term of six* years for deserting his family and eloping with Julia 3owne, a choir singer in his church, can effect 111s release he will eat his Christmas dinner outside of the pris on bars. They are now working zeal ously in his behalf, and will do tlieii utmost to have the court of pardons releast him. The former friends of the ex-pas tor who turned against him at the time of his tritl, because of his con i nection with the Bowne girl, are now i I Interested in his release. They were : incensed over his action, but are | now taking steps to have his punish- j jnent lessened. Cordova is a model prisoner. ; When told of the intention of his, South River friends, he seemed much i pleased and expressed the hope that i he would be able to rejoin them at > Christmas. He is employed in the i handkerchief department. It is said i that the plait to have him liberated ' has been started solely by his social ?1 and business acquaintances, and that i ? his fellow-clergymen have no desire ? to aid him. SALOON LICENSE IS AT STAKE WHILE ACTION IS PENDING.! ? ? . I The ease of Joseph Fecicz, who keeps a saloon at S3 Catherine street, was dismissed by Recorder Pickers gill last night. According to the evidence presented the man who made the complaint, against Fecicz wished to claim damages, and as the case would then be out of the juris diction of the police court in that event, the recorder dismissed it. Fecicz, as told in yesterday's NEWS, was arraigned on a charge of selling liquor without a license. The case has many complications and it is understood that unless Fecicz is compelled to close his saloon, the case will bo brought before the pros ecutor by the complainant, who claims that Fecicz is running a saloon without a license. Some time ago Feciey, sold his I saloon to John Ondercak and had the j license transferred by the excise j board. Ondercak could not make the business pay, and Fecicz again took possession. Chief Burke then order ed him to close as he had no license in his name. Later, members of the excise board, it is declared, gave Fecicz permission to open again. Tbe party who is prosecuting Fec icz says the saloonkeeper is violating ] the law and intends having the law j enforced. Fecicz is running the sa-! loon, while Ondercak holds the lie-; ence in his name. Joseph E. Strieker .represents Fectcz, and as the case is 1 one in which the city is concerned, City Attorney C. C. Hommann will probably be the attorney against the ! defendant. _ WORK RESUMED ON BECKHOFF i BUILDING AFTER A DEAOLOGK.

FERRY MATTER TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARING ON FRIDAY NIGHT. A public hearing on the now ferry question will be held in the council [ > chamber of (he city hall at 8:3tr j ( o'clock Friday night. It was the general impression that the Hoard of 1 Aldermen would take sonic action in i the matter last night, and Guorge S. i Silzer, counsel for the Perth Amboy : and Staten island Ferry Company,. t was present at the meeting. Alder- < man Rossi, however, arose and moved i that the chair name a data for a pub lic hearing. The motion was passed i and Mayor Pfeiffer named Friday night. 1 ?fudge I>yon, who represents the S. I. R. T. Company, was also pres ent at the meeting. The main cause for a dispute on the ferry question is that the new concern does not want to start operations for at least three rears, and, in the minds of many, If the council grants the leave, the new company should agree to start active aperations at once. At the hearing on Friday night, it s expected that the project will be thoroughly discussed. The hearing will be entirely public.
