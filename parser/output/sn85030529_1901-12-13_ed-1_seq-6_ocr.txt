-TH1- CHANUTE TIMES A. H. TURNER. Editor aod Prepnetor. Largest Circulation in Neosho County FRIDAY, DEC.13, 1901 Any reciprocity plan which pro poses to permit foreigners to come in here to hurt an American industry while our own people assail foreign industries, is not only in defiance of the instinct of self preservation, but is opposed by all the best experience we have had. Textile "Record." The man who makes work for two men where there was work but for one man before is a benefactor of the country. The man who re verses that operation whether by re ciprocity or otherwise-is a benefact or, perhaps, of some other country, but not of this one. Economist. The Democratic papers tell us that an anti-trust congress and an anti trust administration could soon knock out all these combines. You see the Democrats still have faith in the ability of their so-called leaders to make the country so dull that all the trusts would starve to death. No doubt they could do it. They are as good wreckers as ever. Mo ravian Falls (N.C.) "Yellow Jacket." Every generation has troubles enough of its own; it should not be compelled to be continually fighting over and over the same questions that divided parties fifty years ago. Questions once thresh d cut should stay so, the wheat and the chaff separate. Every intelligent American knew in 1840 that Protec tion enriched this country, benefit ing especially the worker for wages, and that free trade and all tenden cies to it took business away from the country and so impoverished all but a verv few. Why, then, must these lessons be learned over anO I over every few yearsr kvery new exoerience of the familiar facts scores deeper into the nation and causes greater suffering than before. Why should any party, for sheer partisan advantage, seek to unsettle the public mind with exploded theo ries? Let the "American system" remain henceforth the unchallenged policy of the nation. Such, indeed, would be a course of true patriotism. Ex. t iifi'AdaJiiTif fVKni ASK YOURGROCER FOR PREMIUM LIST. PREMIUMS GIVEN FOR S0APwrPRS ASK HIM rOR DIAMOND "C" 80AP THE BEST LAUNDRY SOAP.

TO MCKINLEY. It is not too much to say that at the time of President McKinle's death he wai the most widely loved man in all the United States; while we have never had any public man of his position who has been so wholly free from the bitter animosi ties incident to public life. His po litical opponents were the first to bear the heartiest and most generous tribute to the broad kindliness of nature, the sweetness and gentleness of character which so endeared him to his close associates. To a stand ard of lofty integrity in public life he united the tender affections and home virtues which are all-import ant in the make-up of national char acter. A eallant soldier in the great war for the union, he also shone as an example to all our people be cause of his conduct in the most si red and intimate of home relations. There could be no personal hatred of him. for he never acted with aught but consideration for the wel fare of others. 

ANARCHY. The blow was not aimed at tyran ny or wealth. It was aimed at one of the strongest champions the wage worker ever had; at one of the most faithful representatives of the system of public rights and representative government who has ever risen to nublic office This criminal was a professed anarchist, inflamed by the teachings of profes sed anarchists, and probably also by the reckless utterances of those who, on the stump and in the public Dress. aDDeal to the dark and evil spirits of malice and ereed, envy and sullen hatred No man or body of men preaching an archistic doctrines should be allow ed at large any more than is preach ing the murder of some specified private individual. Anarchtistic speeches, writings and meeting are essentially seditious and treason able Anarchy is a crime against the whole human race, and all man-kind should band against the anarchist. His crime should be made am offense against the law of nations, like piracy and that form of man-stealing known as luc s'vc wauc, iui n 13 wi hi Lriain- er infamy than either. . . . . The American people are slow to wrath, but when their wrath is once kindled it burns like a consuming flame. TRUSTS. Successful enterprise, of the type which benefits all man-kind, can only exist if the conditions are such as to offer great prizes as the re wards of success The fundamental rule in our national life the rule which underlies all others is that, on the whole, and in the long run, we shall go up or down together Dis aster to great business enterprises can never have its effects limited to the men at the top. It spreads throughout, and while it is bad for everybody, it is worst for those farthest down Much of the legislation directed at the trusts would have been exceedingly mischievous hand it not also been entirely inaffective It is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should not be prohibited, but super vised and within reasonable limits controlled; and in my judgment this conviction is right. . . . What further remedies are needed in the way of governmental regulation or taxation can only be determined af ter publicity has been obtained, by process of law, and in the course of administration If, however, the judgment of the con gress is that it lacks the constitu tional power to pass such an act, then a constitutional amendment should be submitted to confer the power. RECIPROCITY. Reciprocity must be treated as the hand-maiden of protection. . . It is most important that we should maintain the high level of our pres ent prosperity The natural life of development for policy of reciprocity will be in con nection with those of our produc tions which no longer require all of the support once needed o establish them upon a sound basis, and with those others where either because of natural or of economic causes we are beyond the reach of successful competition. NEW POSSESSIONS. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any peo ple of the tropics to make them fit for self government, after the fashion of the really free nations. . . . The adminiitation of these islands should be at wholly free from the suspicions of partisan politics as the administration of the army and navy. . . . . History may safely be challenged to show a aingle in stance in which a masterful race such as our, having been forced by PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT. theexieencies of war to take posses sion of an alien land, has behaved to its' inhabitants with the disinter ested zeal for their progress that our oeonle have shown in the Philip nines. To leave the island at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous an archy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. I NTK KST ATE COM M 

EKCK . That law 1887 was largely an experiment. Experience lias snown the wisdom of its purposes, but has alsn shown, uossiblv that some of its requirements are wrong, certain ly that the means devised for the en forcement of its provisions are de fective The railway is a public servant. Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike. MERCHANT MARINE. It is discreditable to us as a nation that our merchant marine should be utterally insignificent in comparison to that of other nations which we overtop in other forms of business . . . Ships work for their own countries, just as railroads work for their terminal points. . . . Our government should take such action as will remedy these inequalities The American merchant marine should be restored to the ocean. FORESTRY. The preservation of our forests is an imperative Dusiness necessity We have come to see clearly thai whatever destroys the forest, except to make way for agriculture, threat ens our well Deing The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole, and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few. . . . . The forests are natural reservoirs. By restrain ing the streams in flood and replen ishing them in drouth they make possible the use of waters otherwise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation is, therefore, an essential condition of water conser vation. IRRIGATION. It is as right for the national gov ernnient to make streams and rivers of the arid regions useful by engin eering works for storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineerinc works of another kind The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, just as the settle ment of the Ohio and Mississippi valley brought prosperity to the At lantic States In the arid states the only right to water which should be recognized is that of use. NAVY. The American people must either build and maintain an adequate navy or else make up their minds definitely to accept a secondary position in the international affairs, not merely in political, but in com mercial matters. It has been well said that there is no surer way of courting national disaster than to be "opulent, aggressive and unaimed . . . we desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed not the peace granted on terms of ignominy to the craven and the weakling. ARMY. Pressure for the promotion of civ il officials for political reasons is bad enough, but it is tenfold worse where applied on behalf of officers of the army or navy. INDIANS. The Indian should be treated as an individual like the white man. CIVIL SERVICE. The merit system of making ap pointments is in its essence as dem ocratic and American as the com mon school system itself. CHINESE SITUATION. In the attainment of this purpose we necessarily claim parity of treat ment, under the conventions, throughout the empire for our trade and our citizens with those of all other power. THE NEW BOOK, THIRTY YEARS IN WASHINGTON av Ma. GiNiiMi John A. Lofn. Thin macniflcently Illustrated volume la pub lished with tha consent and aid of tlia United States Government, and ahia fact alona ia evl denca of It sterling merit and of tba great eara that hai bean beitowed upon it. It la aaid that all road lead to Washington juat ai thajr did to ancient Roma. Certain It ia that tha ayea of mllliona mho eannot behold tha marvels aad gloriea of our Natlenal Capitol in person are constantly turned toward! it. Tha Book ia a complete panorama of tha countless Interest of the National Capitol as seen by a famous woman who, as the wife of an inlluentlul Senator, a society leader, and a close friend of every mistress of the White House from Lincoln to the present time, has been in close touch with the inner life of Washingtoa and en joyed rare privileges for studying the mighty activities of the Government, such aa no other person has ever before been able to command. Many distinguished men and women have long urged Mrs. Logan to give this volume to the world, She bus rocolved letters from thous ands unknown to her, expressing the hope that it would be written . In her preface she says "My first introduction to the city of Washing' ton was in 1S58, General Logan being a member of Congress, and for more than thirty years have lived there almost continuously, an inter ested observor of passing events. As the wife of a Senator, I mny any that 1 enjoyed unusual privileges and opportunities to see and know the inner life anil activities of the Capitol City, I have had my share of the favor ot tha powers that were, and the honor of being in eluded among the ilistinguishod guests at both private and olliciul entertainments; and I have known the pleasure of personal acquaintance with prominent statesmen, courtly diplomats and beuutiful, winning, and gifted women, fill ing with irraco Hiid dignity the highest social ignitions thnt the iieople could bestow. "It has been my aim to show my renders, both by word and pictorial art, the wonders and th working of the elaborate machinery of the Gov ernnient in motion, by leading them through the great Departments nnd explaining what the army of busy men and women workers do and how they do it; to show them the works of art. the wonderful collections of relics and curlosl' ties from every part of the world, and the archi- Ltectural glories and priceless treasures of tho L apitoi ; to aoscnoe ami explain its giant activ ities ; to take them through the White House from the attic to the cellar, through every 'or hidden room, and to portrny not only its daily life, past and pros 'nt, hut its brilliant social nnd otlicial functions as well ; to tell the story of every President, and of every woman who ever reigned in tho White House ; to visit the Treasury, the Denil Letter office, and to solve the marvels and mystories of every government industry; in short, to present evory interesting phase of life and scenes in Washington." Its illustrations are a triumph of American art. It is worth tho price of the book just to look at these 50 magnificent full-page plates, from photogrnphs taken with government con. sent and aid exclusively for this volume They portray wonderfully interesting scones. The govemniaut generously waived all "rules and regulations" in order that this book by a woman of Mrs. Logan's standing and influence should be as perfect and complete as possible. One can linger a long time over these plates, and though he turns from each with regret he is pretty sure to 11 iui tho next one of still mure absorbing in terest. Wo do not know when 710 pages have given us more genuine pleasuro. If we spoak warmly of the book, it is because it richly doserves it. It is sold by agents, and all who introduce such work ought to bo cordially welcome. Put it in our homes. To own it is to prize it ; to read it is to obtain a liberal education. We heliovo the best way to keep out poor books is by introduc- ng good ones, and a better one than this has never boon brought toournotico. The book is published by the old and well known firm of A. D. Worthiugton &. Co., Hart ford, Conn,, whose imprint is sufficient guarau tee of this first-class volume. They want more agents for it. An agency for a book so popular as this oilers to men and women an unusually good opportunity to do well. Ageut for Chanute, Mrs, Capt. Harmon.
