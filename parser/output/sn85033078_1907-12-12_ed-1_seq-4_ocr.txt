And 1 will trust that lie who heeds The life that hides in mead and wold, Who hangs you alder’s crimson beads, And stains these mosses green and gold, Will still as lie hath done, incline His gracious care to me and mine: Grant what we ask aright from wrong debar. And as the earth grows dark, make brighter every .star. I have not seen, I may not see, My hopes for man take form in fact, But God will give the victory. In due time: in that faith I act. And lie who sees the future sure, The babbling present may endure, And bless meanwhile, the Unseen Hand that leads 

GREAT MONEY RAISING SALE ON account of the mild weather the sale of winter goods has been light, and we find ourselves U up against it,’' as the saying goes.

SALE BEGINS FRWyI Y. DEC. 13h \ The best things are usually bought first, so be among the first to get in. There is always a rush at our sales because people know they are getting high class goods at prices at which inferior goods are usually sold for. Don’t miss this sale as such chances don't come very often. Kruger C 5 Warner Company i ■ 3 Doors from Post Office - - Grand Rapids, Wisconsin The heart's desires beyond the halt ing steps of deeds. Whittier. A Washington scientist claims that he has found a way of making whis key without a worm. What is really needed, however, is something that will elimina'te the snakes. When a man pursuing the daily peaceful avocations of life goes around w ith a revolver on his person, I it is prirna facie evidence that he is either a fool or a criminal, and in either case he ought to be locked up. --.Snarl,” is a despised dog, even among dogs. The human “Snarl” is always shunned by his fellow beings, and has but little influence which always lakes the form of a dark shadow —there is no sunlight in “Snarl’s” soul. A writer in the Philadelphia Press contends that gossip in the country villages is not nearly so prevalent as it is in the so-called best social circles in the cities—nor is it so vicious. The unkind word, the slanderous word, the character-assassinating word, make up a deal of the small talk of people of small minds and corrupt natures. The kickers on the farm are not so hard to get along with as the kickers in town. On the farm there is the kicking cow, and our long eared friend, the mule, while in town there is the old mossback who wants ail the municipal improvements without pav-“ ing for them. The cow mat be sold for beef, the mule traded for a shot gun but nothing but a funeral will get rid of the town kicker. Consider what the hen does when she is working, now that he: strike .season is on and she clamors for ra tions. The market value of -Biddy” is about 50 cents and the value of her daily produce 2 cents, or one twenty fifth part of her own worth. True, her career is short, but long enough for her to earn her value many times over, and that cannot be said of some in this world who have great preten tions to usefulness. Santa Clause is a bringer of joy in more ways than one. Besides the happiness he gives the little ones, he is doing what financiers and govern ments often fail to do: he is restoring vast sums of hoarded money to the sum total of the circulating media. He is the doctor who has the secret tonic which sends the commercial blood coursing healthly through the circulating system of American busi ness. There is net enough jov in this struggling world. So few people have Throat Coughs Ask your doctor about these throat coughs. He will tell you how deceptive they are* A tickling in the throat often means serious trouble ahead. Better explain your case care fully to your doctor, and ask him about your taking Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral.

' 1— Made by the 3. C. Ayer Cos., Lowell, Iliei.—• time for it: but children, happy chil dren, who are brought up in sympa thetic atmosphere, in the infinite leis ure that is theirs, have an immense capacity for joy. How can we deny ourselves that enriching spectacle—a joyous child? The capacity for joy is one of the highest of the human faculties, and it is grossly neglected. We walk too much with our feet in graves. Let us laugh with the chil- | dren and be young. After all there is a good deal in talk. Let a man talk dull times aud it is infectious, everybody talks dull times. Instead of rustling around to take care of what business there is, they all go sit down and mope over dulltimes. If a customer does happen to drob into one of these “dull times” stores he actually gets frightened out of one-half as much as he expects to buy, because things look so blue. He catches the spirit of the store and resolves to hang on to all his money with a death grip, even if his business goes to pieces on account of running short of goods to fill up the empty shelves. The bug-bear of hard times should be sat down upon. It is doing more to kill business than anything else. Tell a man he is sick, keep it up, and you will eventually hound him to death. It has been conceded in all quarters that President Roosevelt's message was one of the most masterly state papers handed down from the chief executive. It is lengthy, but not a line is dull. He makes clear in every word he wrote, his unalterable position again illegal business methods; but never for a single moment forgets his chief motto “A Square Deal to All.” It is a message which inspires con fidence and yet fear; confidence in those who were led to believe that Roosevelt was susceptible to “chill blains:” fear to those who had hoped the above would prove true. His pre scription however is as unaltered as his diagnosis was correct. Best of all the nation is recovering from its se rious illness, under his faithful admin istration. People rejoice to know that the treatment is being continued. The call for the Republican Nat ional convention to meet in Chicago on J une 10th 1908, for the purpose of nominating a candidate for president, has been issued and published by the National committee. After stating the regular method of electing delegates by the conven tion system, the following paragraph is annexed: and provided that delegates both trom the state at large and their alternates may be elected in conformity with the laws of the state in whicli the election occurs, provided the state committee or any such congress ional committee so direct; but provided fur ther, that in no state shall an election be so held as to prevent the delegates from any congressional district and their alternates being selected by the Republican electors of that district. This is the concession asked by the Wisconsin delegation in order that the election in this state might be in accordance with the primary laws upon the statute books. It will be noted from this paragraph that the consent of the state and congressional committees must be obtained before the will of the people as expressed at the primaries can be recognized. While there is no question as to the course of the said committees in Wisconsin, it is amusing to guess at the result, should the committees designated refuse to “so direct.” At the reception of the 'ederated clubs last evening held at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Kellogg, the question of the proper protection of children was thoroughly discussed, immediately following the address of Mrs. Buell, of Madison. The opinions were many and excellent. In view of the prominence lent to this subject by the ladies the Re porter feels that the question of a Humane society in Grand Rapids ought to be given very careful con sideration. A movement, started as a result of articles in this paper written by the “Observer,” is now on foot, and a petition for the establish ment, —or rather the calling ofja mass meeting looking to the discussion and possible establishment of such an or ganization,—is now being circulated and liberally signed by those people who have given the matter due con sideration. To establish sucli a society, it is necessary to have the financial and moral backing of a large number of people. This financial backing means the finances which result from the membership dues, which will probab ly not exceed two or three dollars per year. The moral backing means the heart and hand work as time shall demons; ‘ate the need of it We feel that the movement is in the right direction, as it had been demonstrated in every city of any im portance that only through the organ ized efforts of the humane people, can the cruelty to animals or children be properly punished and prevented. The Wisconsin Humane society is the organization through which this work is being done all over the Bad ger state, and Grand Eapids could do no better than to fall in line and pre vent the re-currance of the many inci dentsof cruelty to animals which have been noticed of late.
