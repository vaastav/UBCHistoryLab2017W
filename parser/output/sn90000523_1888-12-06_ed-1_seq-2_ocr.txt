In discussing the tariff ques tion he descends to shallow dema gogism and demonstrates his utter in ability to discuss such a question from a statesman-like standpoint. He even descends to anarchical commu nistic arguments. The New Yory Press well says : "For a man elected to the office of Chief Magistrate by the suppression of votes and intimidation and murder of voters in many States of the solid South to thus arraign the business and manufacturing interests of the country and impeach the integrity of those who have led far more useful lives than he himself has, is, to say the least, a superb exhibition of igno rant impudence tinctured with the wrath of defeat. The scramble for post-office struck this place last Friday, when H. P. Chase, the present assistant postmas ter, was out with a petition and per sonally solicited signers. In this, as a matter of course to all acquainted with the petition business, he was quite successful. As to what he is going to do with it we are not advis ed. Undoubtedly postmaster God dard has been induced to resign and that resignation and this petition is to go in together, but whether at once or after the new administration comes in, we do not know, orcare. In view of the fact, however, that Mr. Chase, when Harrison was nominated, hung out a Cleveland flag on one side of his door and a Harrison banner on the other side ; and that he kept Dem ocratic literature, including the . ''Grindstone turner," on a desk ac cessible to the public, we would sug gest that his documents be sent in at once so that he can receive his ap pointment from a reform and non partisan administration." :' "Frank Nolan, employed upon the - Bennington' Battle Monument,' had a miraculous escape from a fatal acci , dent, and undoubtedly instant death, last Friday.

His ridiculous challenge I will ac cept upon condition that he himself will take the trouble to And the man willing to mire himself up iu such a matter; and that, at the same time, the following questions be also decid ed i Was the post-office here removed from our good old deacon as a matter of public policy, or of private, cunning aud deceitful, democratic influence? What became of all of those split democratic county tickets with straight Republican headings, but with "G K. Davis" substituted for Sheriff? Why didn't they use them iustead of pilfering Republican tickets? Did the Democrats sell off all their votes for Representative in order to gaiu support for Mr. Davis for Sher iff? If not why did they not set up a candidate of their own ? Did G. K. Davis cause to be in serted iu the Beuuiugton County Re former, in an article charging his Re publican opponent with all manner of crimes and irregularities, a regular signed certificate testifying to his own personal excellence ? Upon the evening before election, did he and his conferree, Btanding in front of the pulpit at a Democratic rally, spend fifteen minutes in vile personal abuse of a person for pre senting, by permission, telegrams from certain prominent Republicans denying their assertion that they had offered Mr. Davis their support? Have the Republicans of Benning ton county an equal right with the Democrats to have bosses, and which clan of bosses bossed the best ? Is it proper for a man who has been a chronic candidate himself every e Iection for years ; who has never hes itated to go around aud boldly elec tioneer for himself ; who has, time aud again, taken, with his owu hands, regular Republican county tickets, and after himself insertiug his own name upon them, offer them for sup port ; is it proper for such a person to charge another with acting in view for office ? In a regular battle and clan fight should the whipped dog growl aud whine, or crawl back iuto his kennel, lick his sores and be quiet? M. J. Hapgood, Peru, Nov. 28, '88 Silk Threads In Bank Note. The paper on which bank notes are printed is called "distinctive paper," be ing used exclusively by the government for the printing of bonds and current notes. Tho mills where it is manufac tured are at Ulen Falls, West Chester county, Perm. An agent of the treasury department receives the paper direct from the hands of tho manufacturer, and every precaution is observed in order to prevent any loss. Short scraps of red silk are mixed with the liquid pulp in an engine. The finished material is conducted to a wire cloth without passing through any screens, which might retain the silken threads. An arrangement above the wire cloth scatters a shower of fine scraps of blue silk thread, which falls upon the paper while it is being formed. The side on which the blue silk is deposited is used for the back of notes, and the threads are so deeply imbedded as to remain perma nently fixed. Each sheet is registered as soon as it is made. Behoboth Sunday Herald. A House Built of Paper. There is a paper house in Atlanta. No wood, brick, iron or other material is used about the building. At 108 Decatur street a neat little store, painted sky blue, has attracted considerable atten tion recently. The gaudy color is not the cause of the little building being the object of so much attention, but the ma terial of which it is constructed makes it a novelty. It is made entirely of paper. The store was built by a Frenchman named Smith (spelled, of course, in a French way), who is agent for the paper of which it is constructed. The rafters, tho weatherboarding, the roof and the flooring are all made of thick, compressed paper boards, impervious to water and as durable as wood. The house cannot catch on fire as easily as a wooden build ing, because the surface of the paper is smooth and hard. The building is used as a store by Neal Kelly, who says he finds it warm in cool weather and com fortable when the weather is warm. At lanta (Ga.) Journal. Secret of a Good Memory.

AOAIN. Thure U tuch a thing drownlu' iorrow, anil 1 know It, Wt .keptkk. nay wat they may. Jax on. West Towushcnd. Vt. Nov 24, '88. JH7. Editor: i will now for the benefit of a long sutferen puMick and my dimercratio fiends, giuerally, try ami disci ibe, frum adimercratic stan pint, a must disshameful event, which will go down tu all cumin generations as the Smith-Barber episode. It was concernin' a bet which was made as tu which wood be elected, our noble president Cleveland or that barbarian, Harrisou. Well as it proved out great head was defeuted, through no fault uv his. No man livin ever wan ted wurs, and we did all we cood for him but it was no use ; if it hed not bin for the people not wuntiu him he'd been Mected. So it was our co worker, brother Smith, hed to wheel this Barbado Theoder tu East Ja- meekv and the nite uv the 20th was appinted for it tu cum off. I hapen ed tu be that- so I posted myself onto the hotel steps tu see the percessliun. Thur was nuthin' but a lot uv boys an old men an' others uv all ages be tween. They was expectin' Wind ham Drum Corps but, Lord tliey now ed better than to be caught in sich company. Well on they cum, burin' torches j jist ahead uv me was sum thin' which looked as if it mite hev bin a resusticated Egiptin mummy stolen from the arkives uv Asia, but i found out that he was the local mu- sishun. He had a red bandana tied over one shoulder an a anshent sword tied onto himself by some sheep twine, and carried an old fiddle onto which he played, they called him Cur tis, and he constituted a band, be mite hav bin George William but thev sed he was a republican ; next cum the wheelbarrow with its repub lican frate, and "Moses" awheelin it Aron and Hur assistin' to hold up his hands, each had a holt on the wheel barrow ; along close to em cum anoth er man which 1 shood judge was a prohibitionist or an ex-preacher or something of that sort, he carried a big tu gallon jug iuto which was the ile which they greased the wheels with ; next cum a lot uv bovs with banners with picture on to 'em. one was a piuttir of our dear president pictured as a dog with a tin can tied to his tail (the dog's tail i mean), onto which said "free trade," and thev had start ed him for buffalo. The band kept all the time plavin'. Aron was a dimercrat and Hur was a republican, what he wanted tu help fur was more than i cood see unless it was fur the sake uv the wheel grease, they had tu stop and ile up evry few minutes. 1 went along with 'era although my feelings was stung Uu think uv the contrast between now and 4 years a go, yet there was to be found some uv the same fluid that we had then. One house on the way was beautiful ly luminated and wood looked good if it had been a dimeiciatie rally, it be longed tu Mr. Geo. Washington, the band kep all the time playin', and the sweat runin' down Moses les. When we arove at the depo at east jameeky there was a big stone where a dimer crat had spit on to it and a republican was try in to set that spit on fire to make a lumination. That's the way them repubs try tu utilize all they can git out uv us, (that's the way they did with Lord Sackville's letter,)but it woodent burn, was watered too much at townshend. Findin' that it wood not burn he jumped on the depo step and shouted "thre cheers for Harri son and Morton." i shut my mouth for once, and says i to myself they'll git no yell out of me for old Harri son. A fresh supply of ile was re ceived when the train cum in, and the depo man opened a barrel of crackers and says, "boys help yirself" Yes here was my chance, and i took in consideration all the evil the repub licans had brung upon us, how this very chap had wanted a post-office thar and probably wood have it soon a thing which is not needed as there is only 50 or 60 families it wood ac comerdate ennyway and they be all republicans and dont ought to have enny mail, yes with all these thoughts in my mind i made a rush for that cracker barl, and i filled all my pock ets, my boot legs and my shurt buzi.n and i think the most uv our boys wer filled with sum feelin uv retaliation onto the republicans. By this time the wheel grease got in its work and they cheered that cracker fellow, the depo, the cars and evry thing thur was thur Tnen we started back. The bnnd kep all the time playin. i don't know who the st lf-appinted Capt. was but there was features about him that led me to believe he was a dimocrat. We stopt on the way to cheer when i herd a deep drawn sigh at my left, such as a hen wood giv if choked, and looking around ther i seed the Capt. a lyin in the the ditch on bis back with bis feet turned up to the moon, i looked up to the moon oh, how small it looked, not so big as a five cent nickle so dim and far away more than a thousand miles, and the stars were all dancing right hand pokys. Shortly alter gitting tu the village and arter lots more cheerin, and arter the band fell over the Capt. and broke some uv thur instruments, the percesshun broke up. i went off with a chap what showed me a bottle by which i nowed he was a fiend. Thur was a dance that nite but none uv onr bovs attended, the floor tu the ball was tu uneven But we will show em in 1892, hurrah ! Jaxon. 

STOLEN DIAMONDS SOME CURIOSITIES OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN TRAFFIC IN ILLICIT GEMS. scheme, and Artlfleee of That Rascally Fraternity, the "I. U. B." How Stolen Stone. Reach Europe Some Interesting gtorlea The Dying Digger. Dr. Matthews, an English practitioner who siient many years in the diamond field or South Africa, has just published in England a book on the subject. An interesting part of his book is that which deals with the development of the great diamond digging industry, and the schemes and artifices of that rascally fraternity, the I. D. B.,or Illicit diamond buyers. There is a saying that five years hi South Africa la lutllcient to corrupt the most immaculate, and that a man who has lived there for seven should not be behoved upon his oath. Dr. Matthews' revelations certainly give color to the saying. According to his account, the larger part of the community of Kimlier lev is mixed up in this uefarious traffic Diamonds, as most people will be aware, are sorted out of dianiondifcrous stuff by native "hands." Some of these hands are probably in the pay of tho fra ternity. A fine stone is turned up by one of them when nobody is looking, lie seizes it, hides it in his hair, in his mouth, or in some other portion of his person. Or if a goat he handy he twists it in Ida wool, and tends the animal affectionately till an opportunity occurs of redeeming the stone. Or, perchance, he conceals it behind a rock, or forces it down the throat of a dog, or, Homeric device, he swallows it himself . The gem being re stored to the light of day from hiding place, whatever it may have been ana many a diamond now sparkling on a lady s neck has made acquaintance with the stomach of a Kafir the dusky thief In due course puts himself in communi cated with another native of a superior class. This man is a tout in the pay of a low white man a "mean white," as he is called in the colonies. i HOW IT IS DONE. I The tout buys the stone for, let.us say, a hundredth part of its value, aid the thief spends the money in the vile drink which it is the peculiar pride of civil ization to supply to the unsophisticated savage, and, so far as he is concerned, there is an end of the transaction. Then the tout carries the stone to the "mean white" and receives from him a svn of money, perhaps double what ha has given to the actual thief. The "mean white" in his turn takes it to the licensed buyer of diamonds, who is possibly a person of glaring and even aggressive respectability a church warden or a member of the municipality, or at least a merchant of good antecedent and from him receives perhaiK a tenth part of the worth of the gem. So far so good; but still there are slips between the cup and the lip, aud it is sometimes found difficult to convey the stuff tut of the country to the final receiver in )Lon don. To this end many artiiices a)e re sorted to. Innocent looking fovling pieces, on examination, have been lOund to be loaded with diamonds to within an inch of the muzzle, while such depos itories as novels with holes cut d the leaves, the quills of ostrich feathen and boots with hollow heels are not uncom mon. Often the fair sex are found to b use ful auxiliaries in these adventure), for there is a peculiar sacredness ablut a lady's underclothing that appeals f the mind of the customs officer. Th man would be bold who merely ventured on her back hair. However this nay be, by far the greater number of stales so procured arrive safely in Europe, i Most people will naturally think that ie na tive rascal who takes the stone is cspon eible for this state of things, but itis not the case. The native never dreaned of stealing diamonds until he was taightto thieve by the white receiver of stolen goods. i : SOME INTERESTING 8TORIESJ Dr. Matthews tells some intenetlng tales of tho I. D. B. f ratensjjji"! the dead of a Certain -' r-jn .rTTT he was roused from sleep and conf lmtod by a trembling and middle aged 6 tizen of the fields, who informed him tlat he had swallowed a thirty carat dianond and two sovereigns just to shoV his friends how the scoundrels did t, and was now anxious to be rid of,' these foreign substances, which had pesum ably begun to disagree. Ultimately they were recovered, and the jiappy citizen departed with the dianond, leaving tho gold in payment. Of tourse this man had disposed of the ditmond under imminent fear of dctectioi; but why he took the two sovereigns itis dif ficult to say, unless it was to g.t his hand in. Some people, by thei way, appear to be able to swallow very large stones, for so lately as last year, a tative upg uuuer auspicious circumstances, stone found in his stomach. Here is another tale, A white gentle man lived with a pretty Fingo wunan, who also acted as his agent i the "trade." He fell ill of fever, anl for weeks lay in a state of delirium, between life and death. She nursed him teiderly through it all, and, what is morej kept up his connection with the "bovi;" so that when he came to himself shi was enabled to present him with hundrtds of carats of fine b tones. And now, mark the sequel. No sooner was he strong enough than ho departed for Europe, taking every gem and farthing sht had collected with him, and leaving th un fortunate girl to starve on the sttects. On a certain occasion Dr. Matthew was called in to attend a dying digger j who had once worked a claim for him. These were tho words that greeted him t hen he told the man that there was no lope: "Doctor, I cannot die without tiling you how, when I worked your claln in No. 6, 1 robbed you of nearly all your diamonds." V In tho face of stories such as these and a mass of other evidence, it is sometimes dillicult not to believe that civilization is a failure and that the educated Chrutian man, except under very exceptional cir cumstances and when restrained by the strictest pressure of law, is a lower ani mal at heart than the savage he despises and destroys with drink and ride bul lets.
