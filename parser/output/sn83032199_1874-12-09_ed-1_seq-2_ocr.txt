It is one of tho numerous instances of corrupt burguin ami sale of public offices by members of Con gress and their political agents wliich havo rendered the present Administra tion so disreputably notorious. Here is a post office worth some f 2, 000 a year, and, liko all such offices, it is substantially in the gill of tho member of Congress who represents the district. The present occupant of tins post onice, -Mr. lltvight 11. liur nard, seems to have held it lor some time. It now turns out that he purchased his Inst appointment from Mr, William T. Kinu, ono of Representative Hale's active lieutenants, lor the sum of $3U0, ensh down, and un annuity of fltOO a year to this thrifty agent's brother-iu-utw ; and it is alleged that these terms havo been i'ultllled, , A new appointment is now about to lie inaile, and It is stated that Jung, this (500 man, is to receive tho office outrighton Mr. Hide's recommendation. This has brought to light tho foregoing facts, to which it seems Mr. Jewell's attention is now called, with a viow of ascertaining whether he countenances such scandalous irallickiiig in puouc offices for political and personal pur poses. -,( The transaction is one of a' doss which has prevaded and still prevades every branch of tha public service throughout the country, of every de gree of magnitude, till tho whole civil service is honey -combed with rascality and corruiition. It la only now and then that the facts of individual cases sea the light, lending a fcrt of dark lantern. view of what is still behind the scones. 1 f tho veil could bo lifted, if want is hidden could bo fully exposed, we should not bavo to wait long for suob a political revolution as this coun try or any other hat hardly over ex perienced. . We cannot permit ourselves to have any doubt alsnit Mr. Jowell's. action in the present case. But wo bono tho exiosuro will operate in other roses where the proot is not so plain. e rocollcet, for instance, that Mr. Halo, under Mr. Blaine's tuition, endeavored to take the lead in condemning tho Credit Mobilier and Salary Grills these two statesmen having luckily kept out of these scrapes. . J)ut notwithstanding this indignant virtue, hero seems to lie a batch of Mr. Rule's own private dirty linen. We recall the fact also that Mr. Hale was charged with mak ing the most corrupt canvass over known in Maine at a time which near lv coincides with the leadino' fiicin now divulged in regard to tho Calais Post Office. The charges made would seem to warrant still further investigation, and we adviso the C'dnn Timet, the Republican journal from which wo de rive our intiirmatioa to undortuko it Did the WiOO which Postmaster Bar nard paid down for his office to Mr. Halo's lieutenant real I v go into Mr. Kings pocket, or Into Air.

A number or our most prominent gentlemen, with George W. Child, James U Clarhnrn, A. K. Bo ne, John Welsh, Ai J. Jmixol, J. (iil liiigbam Fell, John Gibson, and others, have applied for an Act incorporating tho National Monumental Association, tbe object being to erect an appropri ate monument m Idepondenco Square; tho money to be raised by one dollar contributions from every man, woman aud child in thu nation, who desires to so contribute ; the articles of Incorpo ration limiting the subscription to that sum. ' I expect to see this monument unveiled July 4th, 1870. President Grant has paid his dollar, and Vice President Wilson Ins dono the same. ' ' 

TIIK CRNTKNNIAL. 1 ' Tho Interest iu the Centonuiul is steadily on tho increase, all sections of tbo country uniting in most friendly rivalry to do their part towards muk- ingthu International Kxhibition of 1870, a porfect sgvt-iSf. During the past few days meetings have been held in Bridireton. Now Jersey. Norwich. Conn., and others are arranged to come ntr at 1'itlsburgh and Chester, in this State, Trenton, N. J., Boston and New York. Popular feeling has seldom displayed itself moro earnestly than in thu town of Bridgeton, where over six thousand nooule withered Uiirether to listen to the eloquent addresses of tiovornor t'arker and 1 homas 11. Dud ley, of Now Jersey, and Gov. Bigler, of the Centennial Committee. The patriotic fervor shone forth as thu speakers touched upon tho manly deeds . of our forefathers, through whoso exertions we are now in a fit position to celebrate the great anni versary. This interest, I am happy to state, is resulting iu most autialuotory subscriptions, Bridgeton alone sending in $3,000 as her quota to tha Centen nial fund. As it may occur to many of my readers, that it would be well to orgnmxo some means ot raising funds lo aid thu Centennial, I would suggest thu "Tea Party" as u capital plan, and in tho hands of tho ladies, can ho made a gittat success, all funds so raised to be invested ui Centennial Stock, tho proceeds of which, when received, cau bo divided aiming differ ent charities in the city or town, thus doing good in said direction. The Centennial Medals are now ready and ooinji rapidly disposed of. J ho de sign is vory satisfactory, and tbe larg er modal is a very fine specimon of art. i base medals are sent out by tho Hurcau of Revenue, at tho following ririces, by mail : Largo gilt, f 5 ; large ironxo, i'i ; small silver, $3. Letters addressed to the Bureau of Revenue always receive imincdiato attention. The (iovonnnen of Canada has writ ten to tho Director General of tho Kx hibition asking how much spaco will be allowed that country in the Exhi bition, as Canada desires to present a convolute exhibit of her arta aud indus tries.. The. General Director replies that "Canada can have all the space sho may require." t , Norwich, Conn., in order not to bo behind Canada, has written to Gov. Bigler to conio "down Kast" and start tho Centennial bull rolling in that Statu, and Gov. Bigler has gone there, aud on Wednesdays night lost gave the people of that thriving, and industrious uiamilacttinng place, such a plain state ment of facts, and so clearly sot forth their duty to the matter, that I ap prehend that from this time forth the most active exertions will be mado by the manufacturers upon tho banks of lite Connecticut, the Jlousatonic, and the Thames, to got up an exhibit of machinery that will excel that placed upon exhibition by tbe manufacturers upon the Thames, in England, or which comes from Mancbeeter, Liver pool or Sheffield. !, The extensive cotton ami woolen mills UKn tho banks of tho Delaware find Schuylkill, and which line tho tanks of Darby, Chester and other crocks, flowing into these rivers, aro run uy men oi pmgrviwive npint, wuo will tuko advantage of the opportuni ties bore presented, to place in their manufactories tho machinery best adapted to their purpose.

COOKB CO. 1 !' In my lottor of June 27th iastl said that tho 7 per cent, dividend declared by tho trustee in the bankruptcy cose of Jay Conko ic Co. would bo paid hereafter ; that is, it will bo paid here iu Philadelphia, after many legal ques tions have boon disposed of. It has not yet been puid, and at the meeting of creditors, held December 1st, that dividend was revoked, i A Report of 00 pages, pamphlet form, was submitted at this meeting, which comproHsed, simply shows that the indebtedness of the firm is 110, 804,84a The available assets, includ ing cash in hand, may bo set down at half a million dollars. Tho claims against individual members of tile firm amount to 2,KtNI,UIHI, which, niuler the bankrupt act the individual assets must be applied to tho payment of the partnership debts. Tbo cash in hand that ran bo applied to a payment of dividend to general creditors, amounts to f -19 1,9 15.04, and fbr tho payment of individual debts to t ho members ot tho Arm, is 1231,018.05. Just when a dividend will bo paid is a conundrum I give np, and yet It is duo to Jay Coolto to say that he is not responsible at all for this delay. Kvcrything long ago passed trom his hands to the 1 rastov s. Col. John W. Forney huving rovokod tho salo of tho l'rest to Col. A. K.

ATTORNEY GEXERAt WIL LIAMS A XD HIS LIARS. ; 1 The poor, miserable devil whom Grant "keeps in" as hi Attorney Gen eral, after having been kicked out of the iiadical Senate of the United States, with hi character in a "landeau," drawn by bono and driven by ser vants bought out ol the people s money, feels his pitiable plight ' In order that there may be some creature in human form as "honnrublo" as himself, he has in bis employ what ho call Government "detectives." They "are all hnnontblo business men.' Ho uses them for the honorable hns! ncss a spier) and informers in the South, to find out the citixens who are white Democrat, and then hns thorn arrested, handcuffed, dragged hundreds of miles from their homes, beaten, mal treated, and oppressed because they are Democrats ana whito men. Two of those fellows have lately made a rejiort of their high and honor able mission to the South. The lies thoito fellows tell in their report are Worthy of the greatest prniso for their sublime audacity. Tbe Radical negro party In Congress should at once pass a hill to pay them for extra services, owing to tbo great benefits that have resulted at the late dot-lions in th South and North from their efforts to manufacture "outrage" to fire the .northern heart. . n Bon Butler and his gang nf Congress men would soon "sot up a ring" to pass this bill if those fellows and their chief' Williams, would make tho considera tion largo enough "to pay."
