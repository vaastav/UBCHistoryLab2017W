AM(KHJirJJPPLIEMIENT. Th if? 5 PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House oj Representatives : The members of the Forty-sixth Congress kave assembled in their first regular session nnder circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and grateful acknowledg ment to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of National prosper ity which we now enjoy. ' The most interesting events which have occurred in our public affairs since my last annual message to Congress are connected with the financial operations of the govern ment directly affecting the business inter ests of the country. I congratulate Con gress on the successful execution of the re sumption act. At the time fixed and in the manner contemplated bylaw, United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first of January last they have been promptly redeemed on presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all paits of the country, they are re ceived and paid out as the equivalent of coin, i he demand upon tne 1 reasury lor gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange fornotes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals deposited or exchanged for United States notes redeemed js about $40,000,000. THE 

EFFECTS OF RESUMTTION. The resumption of specie payments has been followed by a A ery great revival of business. With a currency equivalent in value to the money of the commercial world, we are enabled to enter upon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The increasing for eign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our tavor, which has been paid in gold, from the 1st of July last, to November 15, to the amount of about $59,000,000. Since the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit. The bonds of the govern ment bearing only four per cent, interest have been sold at or above par, sufficient ia amount to pay off all of the national debt which was redeemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved an nually by the process of refunding the debt, since March 1, 1877, is $14,297,177. The The bonds sold were largely In small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities is much greater than ever before. The amount of the national debt which matures within less than two years is $792,121,700, of which $500,000, 000 bear interest at the rate of five per cent, and the balance is in bonds tearing six per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue ot four per cent, bonds, and, by the reduction of interest "which will thus be effected, about eleven millions ot dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoped, will be provided by Congress during its present session. 

COIXAE. The coinage of gold by the mints of the United States, during the last fiscal year was $40,986,912. The coinage of 6ilver dollars, since the passage ot the act for that purpose, np to November 1, 1879, was $45 -000.850, of which $12,700,344 have been issaed from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,800,506 are still in the possession of the government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the principal commercial nations of Europe, to effect a permanent system for the equality of gold and silver in the recognized money of the world, leads me tt recommend thai Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival of trade, internal and foreign, will supply, during the coming, its own instructions, which may well be awaited before attempt jng further experimental measures with the coinage. 1 would, however, strongly urge upon Congress the importance of authoriz ing the Secretary of the Treasury to sus pend the coinage of silver dollars upon the present legal ratio. The market value of the silvei dollar being uniformly and largely less than the market value of the gold dollar, it is obliviously impracticable to maintain them at par with each other if both are coined without limit. If the cheaper coin is forced into circulation it will, if coined without limit, soon become the sole stand ard of value, and thus defeat the desired object, which is a currency of both gold and silver, which shall be of equivalent value, dollar for dollar, with the universally recognized msney of the world. RETIREMENT OF TTKITED STATES NOTES. The retirement from circulation of United States notes, with the capacity of legal tender in private contracts, is a step to be taken in our progress towards a safe and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the government, and the interest and security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal-tender paper money based wholly upon the authority and credit of the gov ernment, except in extreme emergency is without warrant In the Constitution, and a violation of sound financial princi ples. The issue of United States notes during the late civil war with the (capacity of leeaMender between private individuals was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from eminent peril. The circulation of these notes as paper money, for any protracted period of time alter the accomplishment of this purpose, was not contemplated by the framers ot the law under which they were issued. They anticipated the redemption and withdrawal of these notes at the earliest practicable penoa consistent with the attainment ol the object for which they were provided. interests of the Nation, as well as the wel fare of the citizens ot that Territory, re quire its advance from the territorial form of government to the responsibilities and privileges of a State. This important change will not, however, be approved by the country while the citizens of Utah in very considerable number uphold a practice which is condemned as a crime by the laws of all civilized communities through out the world. The law for the suppression of this of fence was enacted with great unanimity by Congress more than seventeen years ago, but has remained until recently a dead let ter in the Territory of Utah, because of the peculiar difficulties attending its enforce ment. The opinion widely prevailed among the citizens of Utah that the law was in contravention of the Constitutional guarantee of religious freedom. This objection is now removed. The Supreme Court of the United States has decided the law to be within the legislative power of Congress, and binding as a rule of action for all who reside within the Territories. There is no longer any reason for delay or hesitation in its enforce ment. It should be firmly and effectively executed. If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions it should be amended, and, in aid of the purpose in view, I recom mend that more comprehensive and more searching methods for preventing as well as punishing this crime be provided. If necessary to secure obedienca to the law the enjoyment and exercise of the rights and privileges of citizenship in the Terri tories of the United States may be with held or withdrawn from those who violate or oppose the enforcement of the law on this subject. THE DEBT AND DUTY ON TEA AKB COFFEE. The policy ot the United States, steadily adhered to from the adoption of the Con stitution, has been to avoid the creation of a National debt, and when, from necessity In time of war, debts have been created, they have been paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as possible. With this view, and for this purpose, it is recom mended that the existing laws for the ac cumulation of a sinking-fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limit ed period be maintained. If any change of the objects or rates of taxation is deem ed necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that a duty can be placed on tea and coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several mil lions of dollars annually to the Treasury. 

POLTGAMV. The continual deliberate violation by a large number of the prominent and influ ential citizens of the Territory of Utah of the laws of the United States for the pros culion and punishment of polygamy de mands the attention of every department of the Government. This Territory has a population sufficient to entitle it to admission as a State, and the general EQUAL RIGHTS AND A FREE BALLOT. The elections of tLJ past year, though occupied only with State offices, have not failed to elicit in the political discussions which attended them all over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citizens take in the progress of the country to wards a more general and complete establishment, at whatever cost, ot universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective fran chise. While many topics of political concern demand great attention from our people both in the sphere of National and State authority, I find no reason to qualify the opinion I expressed in my last annual message, that no temporary or administra tive interests of government, however ur gent or weighty, will ever displace the zeal of our people in defence of the primary rights ot citizenship, and that the power of public opinion will override all political prejudices, and all sectional and State at tachments, in demanding that all over our wide territory the name and character of citizen of the United States shall mean one and the same thing, and carry with them unchallenged security and respect, i ear nestiy appeal to the intelligence and pa triotism ot all good citizens of every part oi me country, However mucn they be di vided in opinions on other political sub jects, to unite in compelling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right ot suffrage. 1 respectlully urge upon Congress to supply any detects in these laws which experience has shown and which it is within its power to remedy. I again invoke the co-operation of the execu tive and legislative authorities of the States In this great purpose. I am fully convinc ed that if the public mind can be set at rest on this paramount question of popular rignts, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the complete pacification of the country, or retard the general diffusion ol prosperity. 

CIVIL SERVICE REFORM. in a lormer message i invited the atten tion ol Congress to the subject of the refer mation ot the civil service of the Govern ment, and expressed the intention ot trans- muting to Congress as earlv as practica ble a report upon this subject by the chair man oi me uivu oervice commission. in view or me iacts mat. during a con siderable period, the Government of Great Britain has been dealing with administra tive problems and abuses, in various par ticulars analogous to tnoso presented in this country, and that in recent years the measures adopted were understood to have been enecuve and in every respect highly sausiaciory, l inougnt it desirable to nave luller information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elaborate and com prehensive report. The report sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in tireat Uritain. and of the rise and fall of the parliamentary patronage, ana oi omciai interterence with the freedom of elections. It shows that alter long trials of various kinds of exami nations, those which are competitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have, with great ad vantage, been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The com pletion ot the report, owing to the extent ot the labor involved in its preparation, and the omission of Congress to make any pro vision either for the compensation or the expenses oi the Commission, has been postponed until the present time. It is herewith transmitted to Congress. While the retorm measures of another government are ot no authority lor U3 they are entitled to influence, to the extent to which their intrinsic wisdom, and their adaptation to our institutions and social life may commend them to our considera tion. The views I have heretofore expressed concerning me ueiects ana abuses in our civil administration remain unchanged, except in so far as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of omcers ana oi me people themselves to co operate tor their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan spoils system of appointment to omce and ot olflce tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the re ports oi Departments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the messages of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their re form has been admitted. To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and justice, and must be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are inevitable and essential in a free State. When the people have approved a policy at a National election, con fidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and ot the advisers who, in ac cordance with our political institutions, should be consulted in the policy which it Is their duty to carry into effect, is indis pensable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its vpirit in the performance of their official duties. Very different considerations apply to the greater number of those who fill the the subordinate places in the civil service. Their responsibility is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service'eonsists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the same, what ever party is in power and whatever policy prevails. As a consequence, it follows that their tenure of office should not depend on the prevalence of any policy or the 6uprem acy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most usefully, quite irrespective of partisan in terests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also pre vail in the appointment, discipline, and re moval of these subordinates. The author ity of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, whicy may be used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised in the public interest, under all the sanctions which attend the obliga tion to apply the public funds only for public purposes. Every citizen has an equal right to the honor and profit of entering the public ser vice of his country. The only just ground of discrimination, is the measure ol char acter and capacity he has to make that ser vice most useful to the people. Except in cases where, unpon just and recognized principles, as upon the theory of pensions, offices and promotions are bestowed as re wards for past services, their bestowal upon any theory which disregards personal merit, is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing power is held. In the light of these principles, it be comes of great importance to provide just and adequate means, especially for every department, and large administrative-of-fice, where personal discrimination on the part of its head is not practicable, for as certaining those qualifications to which appointments and removals should hava reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of as certaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends, but, of necessity, to discourage all worthy aspi rants, by handing over appointments and removals, to mere influence and favoritism. If it is the right of the worthiest claimant to gain the appoint ment, and the interest of the people to be stow it upon him, it would seem that a wise method of ascertaining personal fit ness for office must be an important and permanent function of every just and wise government. It has long since become impossible, in the great offices, for those having the duty of nomination and ap pointment, to personally examine into the individual qualifications ot more than a small proportion of those seeking office; and, with the enlargement of the civil ser vice, that proportion must continue to be come less. In the earlier years of the government, the subordinate officers werj so few ia numler that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions 1o personal'y ascertain the merits of candi dates, l'arty managers and methods had not then become powerful agencies of co ercion, Lostile to the tree ana just exercise of the appointing power. A large and responsible part of the duty of restoring the civil service to the desired purity and efficiency rests upon the Presi dent, and it is my purpose to do what is within my power to advance such prudent and gradual measures of reform as will most surely and rapidly bring about that radical change of system essential to make our administrative methods satisfactory to a free und intelligent people. By a proper exercise of authority, it is in the power of the Executive to do much to promote such a reform. But it cannot be too clearly un derstood that nothing adequate can be ac complished without co-operation on the part of Congress and considerate and in telligent support among the people. Re forms which challenge the generally ac cepted theories of parties, and demand changes in the methods of departments. are not the work of a day. I heir perma nent foundations must be laid in sound principles, and in an experience which demonstrates their wisdom and exposes the errors of their adversaries. Every worthy officer desires to make his official action a gain and an honor to his country, but the people themselves, far more than their officers in public station, are interested in a pure, economical and vigorous adminis tration. COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS AND THE CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION. By laws enacted tn 1S53 and 1S55, and now in suostance incorporated in the lie vised Statutes, the practice ot arbitrary appointments to the several subordinate grades in the great departments was con demned, and examinations, as to capacity. to be conducted by department boards of examiners, were provided for and made conditions of admission to the public ser vice, lhese statutes are a decision by Congress that examinations of some sort.as to attainments and capacity, are essential to the well being of the public service. The important questions sinces the enactment of tliese laws have been as to the character of these examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common right and merit, were to control the access to the examinations. In practice, these ex aminations have not always been open to worthy persons generally, who might wish to be examined. Official .favoritism and partisan influence, as a rule, appear to have designated those who alone ere permitted to go before the examining boards, subject ing even the examiners to a pressure from the friends of the candidates very difficult to resist. As a conseouence. the standard of admission fell below that which the pub- jic interest aemanaea- it was almost inev itable that a svstem which provided for various separate boards of examiners, with no common supervision or uniform method ot procedure, should result in confusion, inconsistency, and inadequate tests ol capacity highly detrimental to the public interests. A further and more radical change was obviously requ'red. in me annual message ot December. 1870. my predecessor declared that "there is no duty which so much embarrasses the Ex ecutive and heads of Departments as that of appointments; nor is there any such J . . mm . - ' arauous ana tnanmess labor imposed on Senators and Representatives as that of finding places for constituents. The pres ent system does not secure the best men, and often not even fit men for the nuhlir. places. The elevation and purification of the civil service of the Government will he bailed with approval by the whole neonle of the United States." Congress accord ingly passed the act, approved March 3. 1S1, "to regulate the civil service nf ihn United States and promote the cBi(ini v thereof," giving the necessary authority to the Extcutlve to inaugurate a. rivil ciixa reform. Acting under this statute, wh ich vi) in. tended to secure a svstem of iust nri fTwt. ual examinations under uniform tupervis ion, a numoer of eminently competent persons were selected for the nnrnn who entered with zeal upon the discharge of their duties, prepared, with an intelligent appreciation of the requirements of the ser- vice, the regulations contemplated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capacity as a board, have been known as the "Ciyil Service Commission." Congress lor two years appropriated the money needed for the compensation and for the expense of carrying on the work of the Commission. It appears ironi the report of the Com mission, submitted to the President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an annual appropriation of about $2o, 000 would be required to meet the annual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties- of the Commission. The report was transmitted to Congress by special message of April 18, 1874, with the following favorable comment upon the la bors of the Commission : "If sustained by Congress, I have no doubt the rules can, after thp experienced gained, be so im proved and enforced as to etill more materi ally benefit the public service and relieve the Executive, members of Congress, and the heads of departments, from influences prejudicial to good administration. The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown by the opinions of the members of the Cabinet and their subordinates in the departments, and In that opinion I concur." And in the annual message ot December of the same year similar views are expressed, and an appropriation for continuing the work of the Commission again advised. The appropriation was not made, and, as a consequence, the active work of the Com mision was suspended, leaving the Com mission itself still in existence. Without the means, therefore, of causing qualifica tions to be tested in any systematic manner, or of securing for the public service the advatages of competition upon any exten sive pian. I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an appropriation for the resumption of the woik of the Commission. In the meantime, however, competitive examinations under many embrrassments have been conducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washing ton, and in a number of the custom houses and postoffices of the prinefpal cities of the country, with a view to further test their effects, and, in every instance, they have been found to be as salutary a9 they are stated to have been Under the administra tion ot my predecessor. I think the econ omy, purity and efficiency of the public service would be greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practica ble, throughout the eniire ciyil service of the government, together with ample pro vision for their general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Reports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster General, from the postmaster in the city of Ne7 York, where such examinations have been sometime on trial, and also from the collector of the port, the naval officer, and the surveyor in that city, and from the postmasters and collectors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where applied, has, in various ways, con tributed to improve the public service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the general application of similar rules cannot fail to bo of decided benefit to the service. The reports of the Government officers, in the city of Mew York especially, bear de cided testimony to the utility of open Com petitive examinations in their respective offices, showing that "these examinations, and the excellent qualifications of those ad mitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously ia the service, and par ticularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been, on the part of these latter, an increased interest in the work, and a de sire to extend acquaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens who have had an opportunity to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of determining the results, and those visitors have, without exception, ap proved the methods employed, and several ot them have publicly attested their favor able opinion." Upon such considerations, I deem it my duty to renew the recommendation con tained in my annual message ot December, 1877, requesting Congress to make the nec essary appropriation for the resumption of the work of the Civil-Service Commission. Economy will be promoted by authorizing a moderate compensation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the Commission, as the Executive may direct I am convinced that if a just and ade quate test of merit is enforced for admis sion to the public service and in making promotions, such abuses as removals with out good cause and partisan and official interference with the proper exercise of the appointing power, will in large measure disappear. tax, the excess is an indirect robberv of th public funds. I recommend, therefore, such a revision and extension of present statutes as shall secure to those in every grade ot official life or public employment the protection, with which a great and enlightened Nation should guard those who are faithful in its service.
