We yield much of our editorial space to-day to a synopsis of the President's ' Message, a document which has been anxiously looked for in very section of the country. What positions the Presi dent may assume now in the reconstruc tion of the Southern States, will be read with interest at every nresiaekin mo South. Andy Johksok, at present, is . Jinnn of the South. Ee atnnrln. to-day. as a "Stonewall," sisling the encroachments of a fanatical Congress upon its dearest vested ngni. Should he fail us, and we be placed entirely at the mercy of Thid. Stevehs, Riiti.kr. Sciie t Co., then we may hid farewell to States Rights, and ex pect to see the once free South reduced to conquered provinces. Already we see by telegram that Mr. Scmsk yester day gave notice of a bill aiioiismng u State eovernments in tne bouw, una declaring that the South shall not vote ,i. rvtmtWiitinnal Amendment We UU WO - have not time nor space to-day for a lengthy review of this able message, but it has the ring of the true metal about It, and we can but congratulate the South ern people that they have such an able and fearless representative, and one who does not falter beneath the whirl wiud of the fiercest opposition. There is no sublimer spectacle in history than Ahdt Jobnsos, the "Great Tribune of the People," resisting the encroachments of a despotic and fanatical Congress. He to whom was extended the tempting offer of being the next Radical candidate for the Presidency, and, of course, over whelmingly elected, has spurned their bribe, and, fearless in the conviction of right, has yielded to no temptation which could induce him to change the line of his duty, and extend even-handed jus tice to the whole country. We commend a careful perusal of this document to our readers. 

PUBLIC 7IIAICES. The New Orleans Crttcent, in an ar ticle on the public finances, makes the following sensible conclusions: Mr. Mc Cclloch, so onr special telegram informs ns, is highly satisfied with the financial prospect, and will recommend all mea sures tending to the re-establishment of a specie basis. We are not informed, however, precisely what measures are relied on to accomplish this object If it is meant that there is to be a forced re sumption of specie payments, we fear not only that such a measure is impracti cable, but that the effort to enforce it will be followed by disastrous conse quences. What is especially desirable is that, for the future, there shall be no further expansion of the currency ; but that a gradual system of reduction of the volume of the paper cir culation shall be adopted, and etrictly adhered to. Such a system, how ever, is inconsistent with the idea of that speedy extinguishment of the public debt which is a favorite scheme with so many who fancy that it would be a very due thing to pay eff a couple of thousand millions in a miraculously short space of time. The absorption of the currency by taxation concurrently with the heavy impositions necessary for the rapid re demption of the public obligations would be too much for the industry of the coun try. It would certainly be very desirable to pet rid of the debt ; but if the process should ruin industry and trade, it would not be pleasant after all. In addition to the reduction of the paper currency to an amount commensurate with the actual wants of the country, it would be very expedient to equalize all the pub lic securities by converting them into bonds bearing a uniform rate of inter est Five per cent would be high enough, and wo believe that a conver sion of the whole amount would be practicable at this figure. The complex system of five-twenties, ten-forties, seven-thirties, bonds bearing gold in terest and bonds bearing interest in currency, is productive of great confu aion, and tends to depreciate the value of government securities. Converting them all into one kind of bonds, bearing a fair and uniform interest, payable in gold, would greatly simplify the public finances, and would increase confidence in the Government; and would, thereby, hasten the approach of the moment when specie payments could be resumed nat urally and easily, and without any violent shock to our commercial system. MISSISSIPPI XIYEK aULWAY. Many of oar readers are perhaps not aware of the fact that a railroad run ning on an air line from Memphis to Cairo is in contemplation that a char ter has been granted with Slate aid, a route surveyed, and competent gentle men engaged in canvassing the counties for subscription stock in the road and from the reports we gather from these gentlemen, the prospects of building the road at no distant day, are exceedingly encouraging. The route which this road will take, will be through the richest counties in West Tennessee, and will epen a trade with Memphis which here tofore has gono to St liouis and Louis ville. Memphis should bo deeply inter ested in building this road; and while they are called unou to subscribe to the Littlo Reck Road, let them not forget that there are other roads which uav eaual claim upon their consideration and none more so than the road above mentioned. This will be the great thronch route for all Eastern travel, beine sixty miles shorter than any olhc road to Cairo and tho North, and from W im Denirranhieal Bosition must some duy bo built: the wants of commerce an iIia limnnrl of trade will force tlii great work through sooner or lutcr. KEPEESEN T ATITE 5EGK0ES. The Peoria (111.) Democrat says it has been supposed by many that tho story of the election of two negroes to the Lcgis hit u re ef Massachusetts was a hoax, or at least that they were elected in a joke as a lesson to the uauicais. no tyn.., i n'u n i: ....... field Itevublkan, a moderate paper in most thtnes. says it was a thing intended and that they were chosen as the actual representatives of tho Radical element in their resnective districts. Mitchell is frnm the richest and most aristocratic ward in Boston, and of course his elec tion is the expression of the regard in which the negro is held in the " upper ten " circles of the " Hub of the Uni verse." The other is elected from Charles- town, a city only second in wealth and aristocracy to the negro ward in Boston. We have no disposition to find fault with the choice of these "richest and most ar istocratic" districts. They know better than we do who will best represent them, and have chosen such as will best do it. JOHIf H. BTRKATT CAPTURED. By telegram from Rome, yesterday, we see that John II. Surratt, implica ted in the assassination of the lute la mented President Lixcolk, has been re arrested in Egypt, and will be forwarded to the United States under a proper guard as soon as possible. This is a striking illustration of the old axiom that "murder will out, and that crime will follow us in our lonely wan derings even to the uttermost confines of the earth and though for a time we may seek safety in flight and solitude, yet there can be no escape from a guilty conscience.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Telegraphic Cor. Cincinnati Commercial. Washington, December 2. The Pre' iifont'u mpsRflffA W ill be delivered to-mor- rn tn hnth Houses of Congress, at 1 p.m., by CoL Robert Johnson, the Private Secretary. Within an hour from that time it will be issued in full from tho offices of the leading journals of this country. There will he, tnereiore, no violation ot tattb nor promise in auuci patiug a lew hours its salient ana impor tant points in the loiiowing correct sya nnsia: ibe message opens, as usuai, wun thanks to Providence for the peace and prosperity, in the abatement ot the pesti' lence ana tne restoration oi civu auiuur- tv throughout the United states. A review is then bad of the facts set forth in the last message, relative to the measures which the Executive bad taken for the gradual restoration of tbe South ern States lo the Union, such as appoint- dc Provisional Governors, etc. Unly one thing then remuined, the message says, to be done, and that was the ad mission of the loyal representatives to Congress. This question was devolved aolelv on Comrresa. In the meantime, the President says, no other plan haying been proposed, ho continued his efforts to perfect a restoration through the jo- icial, revenue and postal systems oi tne country. I he South bad also ratibed the amend ment abolishine slavery, conformed their social laws to the fact, repudiated the rebel debts, and proceeded in good faith to legislate for the amelioration of the colored race. The President then spoke as follows: Coneress, however, yet hesitated to dmit any of these States to represent lion, and it was near the close of the ighth month of the session that an ex. ception was made in Uvor ot iennea- see. I deem it a subject of profound re gret that Congress has thus far failed to admit to seats the loyal Senators and Representatives from the other States, wherein the inhabitants, with those of Tennessee, had engaged in rebellion ; ten States, more than one-fourth of the hole number, remain without repre sentation. I tie seats of hlty members of the House and twenty of the Senate are yet vacant, not by their awn con sent not by a failure of election, but by the refusal of Congress to accept their credentials. "Their admission, it is believed, would ave accomplished much toward the re newal and (strengthening of our relations as one people, and removed serious cause for discontent on the part of the people of those States. It would have accorded ith the great principle enunciated in tbe Declaration of Independence, that no people oscht to bear the burden of . i . i , .j . axalion ana yei oe ueniea representa- on. It would have been in consonance ith the express provisions of ibe Con- litulion, that each Mate shall have at least one Representative, and that no State, without its r-onxent, shall be de prived of equal suffrage in the Senate. "These provisions were intended to secure to every State the right of repre sentation in Congress, and so important was it deemed by the fratners of the Con stitution that Ibe equality of States shall be preserved in the senate, that not eveu by an amendment of the Constitution ran any titate, witnout its consent, be letiied a voice in that branch of tbe Na tional Legislature. "It has been assumed that these States by rebellion became Territories, but all departments of the Government with great distinctness refused to sanction an assumption so incompatible with the nature of our republican system, and the professed object of the war. Throughout tbe recent legislation of Congress, the undeniable fact makes it self apparent that these ten political communities are nothing less than States." Tbe President then quotes the Critten den resolutions of 1861, on tbe object of the war, and reviews the legislation of Congress wherein the States are recog nized, and also in Lincoln's proclama tion, lie then proceeds again, as fol lows: " In the admission of Senators and Representatives from all tbe States there can be no grounds of apprehension that persons who are disloyal will be clothed with the powers of legislation, for this could not happen when tbe Constitution and laws are enforced by a vigilant and faithful Congress. Each House is tbe judge of its own member. ASenatotor member may be aumiuca or tejecte'i, or hi credential referred to a proper com mittee. If admitted to a aeat, it must be on evidence satisfactory that he pos sesses the requisite loyal and constitu tional qualifications. If refused admis sion, and tent to bis constituents for want of allegiance, they are admonished that none but persons loyal to the United States will be allowed in the councils of the nation, and the power and moral influence of Congress are thus effectively exerted in the interest of loyalty to the liovernmeut and fidelity to tire Union. "Upon this question so vitally affect inj! tbe rekturnliun of the L'uion, and tbe permanency of our form of govern ment, my convictions, heretofore ex pressed, have undergone no change, but on tbe contrary, their correctness Ls W-en confirmed by reflection and t;me. "If the admiikion of loyal member to seat in Congress was wise and expe dient a year ago, it is no less wise and expedient now. If this anomalous con dition is right now if in tbe exact con dition of these Slate at the present time, it ia lawful to exclude tbem from representation, I do not see that the question will 1 changed by the effect of lime. Ten year hence, if lhee State remain a they are, the right of repre sentation will be no stronger and tbe right of exclusion will be no weaker. "Tbe Constitution makes it tha duty of the President ta recommend to tbe ronnHeraiion of Coneress such measures a be shal! ea expedient I know of no mrasuro morn imperatively doinutid ing the consideration of national intercut sound policy and equal justice than the admission of loyal members from tbe unrepresented States. It would conauni mate the restoration, renew vigor and stability, and induce emigration, and open new fields of enterprise. The President conclude on restora tion by repeating the warning of other against a consolidated despotism, and does not make tho slightest reference to the ponding ccsstttatioual amendment, nor the much talked of amnesty and suffrage question. All he says on recon struction I have given verbatim, The President speaks as follows on Mexican uMuirs: " In the month of April last, as Con' grcss is aware, a friendly agreement was made between tho r.iuperor ot franco and the President, for the withdrawal from Mexico of the French expedition ary forces. This withdrawal was to be effected in three detachments, the first of which, it wns understood, was to leave Mexico in November, tbe second in March, and the third in November, 1807. Immediately on the completion ot the evacuation, the French Govern ment was to assume tho same attitude in regard to non-intervention, as is held by the United States. Repeated as surances have been given the President since that agreement that France would complete the promised evacuation with in the period named, or even sooner. " It was reasonably expected that the proceeding thus contemplated' would produce a crisis of great political inter est in the Republic of Mexico. The newly appointed Minister of the United States, Mr. Campbell, was therefore sent forward on November 9, to assume his functions. It was also thought expedient that he should be attended in the vicinity of Mexico by the Lieutenant General of the United States Army, with the view of obtaining such information as might be important to determine the course to be pursued by the United States in re establishing and maintaining necessary and proper intercourse witb Alexico. Deeply interested in the cause of liberty and humanity, it seemed an obvious duty on our part to exercise whatever influ ence we possessed for the restoration and permanent establishment in that country a domestic ana republican iorm oi government " Such was the condition of affairs in regard to Mexico, when, on the 22d of November, othcial intormation was re ceived from Paris that the Emperor had some time before decided not to withdraw detachments of his forces in the month of November,accorJing to agreement ; but this decision was made for the pur pose of withdrawing the whole of these forces in the ensuing spring. Of this alter determination, however, the United States has received no notice or intima tion, and so soon as this information was received by this Government, care was aken to make known its dissent to tbe Emperor of France. 1 cannot torego tbe hope that France will reconsider the subject, and adopt some resolution in regard to the evacua tion of Mexico, which wilt conform to the existing engagement, and meet the expectations of this Government Tbe ocoments on tbe subject will be laid be fore Congress, With the evacuation of Mexico by the French, no subject for serious differences between France and tbe United States would remain. On our relations with Great Britain the President writes as follows: " It is a matter of regret that no considerable advance has been made toward an ad- ustment of the difference between the United States and Great Britain, arising out of the depredations on our national commerce, and other trespasses com mitted during the civil war by British subjects, in violation of international law and treats obligations. ' This delay, however, may be believed to hare resulted in no small degree from the domestic situation of Great Britain. An entire chance of Ministry occurred n that country during the lust session of 'arhament. 1 he attention of tbe new Ministry was called to the subject at an early day, and there is some reason to believe that it will be considered in a be coming and friendly spirit " The importance of an early disposi tion of the question cannot be exaggera ted. Whatever might be the wishes of the two Governments, it is manifest that good will and friendship between the two countries cannot be established until a reciprocity in the practice of good faith and ncutrahty shall be restored between the respective nations." The President then alludes to the Fe nian invasion of Canada, as a violation of the neutrality laws and tho proclama tion which be. issued; and on the trial and sentence of captured Fenians he says: " Such representations have been made to Great Britain as will, it is hoped, induce judicious amnesty to all who were engaged in the invasion." After referring briefly to the annual reports, and recommending piat this dis trict be allowed a delegate in Congress, tbe President concludes as follows: "In tbe performance of a dnty im posed by the Constitution, I have sub milted to the representatives of the States and the people, such information of our domestic and foreign affairs as the pnblic interests may require. Our Government i now undergoing its most trying ordeal, and my earnest prayer is, that tbe peril may be successfully and finally passed without impairing its orig inal strength and symmetry. Ibe inter ests of the natiop are beat to be promoted by tbe revival of fraternal relations, the complete obliteration of our past differences, and the inauguration of all the pursuit of peace. Directing our effort to the early accomplishment of the great end, let us endeavor to preserve harmony between the co ordinate depart ment of the Government, that each in its proper sphere may cordially co-operate aith the other in securing the main tainence of the Constitution, the preser vation of the Union and the perpetuity of free institution. "Andrew Joonson." 

FEOM WASHINGTON. Abrogation of State Governmeats. Tbe Nogroea to be Armed and Quar tered on the White. Wi n ivoTov. Dec. 3. The committee ar.oointed to prepare a programme of action for the Radical caucus on Wed nesday evening, have thtjir proposition all cut and dried. The bill they will offer for the approval of the caucus i very imilar to the one offered in Con gres by Hon. Thad. Stevens. It contemplate an abolition of the present State government in all the Southern Stau- on the ground of their unconstitutionality, and provides for the appointment of a commissioner for each State, who shall have power to appoint the civil and military officer necessary for the promotion of peace and good order. Tbe commissioners are to call conven tion for the purpose of adopting a con stitution with a view to admission ia tbe Union. There is a difference of opinion a to the right of franchise. Some are in favor of only loyalista voting; some in favor of Congress designating who shall or .ball not ; while other advocate allowing those to vote who are now Qualified under State laws. The constitutions adopted by these conventions are lo be re-submitted, but only theso to be allowed to vote who are enfranchised by the constitutions votea on. as was the case in Maryland. ' If the constitution he adonted bv these voters. then tha States are to be re-admitted ; if rejected, then the rejection will bo fol lowed by territorial governments. , Tha commissioners are to be author izud to organize the militia, including tha colored nonulntion. to aid in carry ing out the provisions of the bills. 'If called into service they are to ne quar tered on thoso rendering the call neces sary. Such arc the lending points in the Drosrainmn that will be presented forlhe approval of the Radical Convention, and the Southern loyalists express strong hopes of success.

The Worlilt correspondence, of Nov. 21st, says a re ward of one thousand pounds has been offered for the arrest of James Srephens. There is a perfect stagnation in com mercial circles ; trade is at a complete stand-still ; the potato crop is alleged to be a fuilure, and everything goes to prove that if something is not done for Ireland during the coming year, the country will present a picture of misery and poverty even worse than in previous times. Wm. II. Bliss has brought suit against the city of Brooklyn to recover fifty thousand dollars' damages for alleged in fringement of his patent for hope coup lings. A train from Paterson, N. J., had a narrow escape from a serious calamity last evening, while passing through the tunnel at Bergen. A huge rock having become loosened and dropped on the track, the engine collided with sufficient force to threw the train from the track. None of the passengers were seriously injured. At a very full meeting of the operative plasterers lust night, delegates to the Workiugman's Union Association were instructed to vote in favor of holding a grand city mass meeting of all the trades, for the agitation of the eight hour system. The United States buildings in Cham bers street, on the site of Burton's old theatre, have been sold for $2.1,000.

Richardson, at Poughkeepsie, and sentenced. Frentice on Negro Suffrage. Prentice says it is of no sort of con sequence that three or four papers in tin) South favor tho adoption of negro siifl'rugc ns a means of getting their sec tion back into its old position in the Union. Where one Soathern paper sup ports the loathsome policy, scores scorn uud scout it And as with the press so with individuals there's no division in public sentiment worth noting. If the odious measure proposed were put to a vote in the South, there would be a mere squeak on one side and a thunder-roar on the other. The reason suggested by tbe Mobile Register for tb Southern people's assent to negro suffrage is that they are now under Northern military power subject in all things to Northern combination, and that tbey may well escape from such a condition by any means possible. But tbe obvious reply to this is, that, what ever the present condition of the South may be, it is a condition forced upon her against her will. She submits to it only became she cannot help herself. She ia not responsible for the humiliation she endures. But, if she vote to have negro suffrage, tha act will be her own. She will be disgraced not only with her own consent but by herself. And 'tis only by herself that the South can be disgraced. She may be oppressed and ground down by superior power, freedom of speech and of action may be denied to her, her life's life may be al most crushed out of her, and yet, if she deport herself proudly in her evil days, bearing with stoical philosophy what she cannot avert or cast from her, but sternly disdaining to be made an agent for the infliction of wrongs npon herself, she will keep her self respect and the repoet of mankind. And self-respect is the basis of all material prosperity worth achieving or seeking. Tbe Fortieth Cacgres. Wasdis(;tox, December 2. At tbe Re publican caucus last evening, among wilier propositions discussed, was one that a law should be introduced and passed requiring a meeting of the fortieth Congress on the 5th of March next, im mediately npon the termination of the present Congress. This proposition met with general acceptance, and the Repub lican members generally are under stood, to be in favor of it In the present temper of Congress, as indi cated by the member already arrived there i little doubt that such a law will be passed before the termination of tbe rWth Congress. The Republican mem bers of Congress little hope for any ami cable arrangement of the difficulties be tween that body and the President The reports that tbe President was disposed to make concession calculated to d.min ish I!ie disagreement with Congres on Important luatf rs are without founda-l.cn.
