O I N E A U N SATURDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1896. FRED FALLEY, editor of tbe Wahpe ton Globe and Secretary ot State elect, Was married on Thanksgiving day. THE CoufiANT congratulates Fred. WELL, Bro. Tuttle, you of The Man dan Pioneer, better let up on the Kent case. The thing's done and you can't undo it—and we don't believe you would if you could. CONGRESS met Monday and now we Will have the usual grind until the 4th of March when the new regime will take charge of affairs and turn on the wheels of prosperity. President Cleve land delivered his farewell message— It very able document. His treatment of the Cuban question was statesman like, and thoroughly American. He is receiving deserved encomiums on every hand. THE Grand Forks Plaindealer Is still aimlessly pawing the air, seeming ob livious of the fact that it has the medal for being tbe Ananias of thePopocratic press of the State. Really now, we Wonder if the P. D. actually thinks that any one pays any attention what ever to any of its wild braying! Come off, Caruth, and quit expressing 3'our selt We had too much of that during the campaign, and all have come to believe that you couldn't hit the truth if jou really tried hard Iw tbe contest over the office of Hegister of Deeds of Pembina County, the Hon. N. C. Young, of Bathgate, is attorney for A. H. Johnson, Republi can, of Drayton, in his contest against JL M. Chisholm, fusioniBt. The returns •bow Chisholm to have a plurality of 4jdout 70.

He was also nominated by" an Independent convention, and his name was placed in the Independent column. He received a number of votes as a Democrat he also received votes as an Independent. The judges ©f election then, without authority, combined the two votes which gave him a majority. Mr. Young claims that this is illegal, and that if Mr. Chisholm is elected it must be as either Democrat or an Independent, but not as both. The case will probably go to the Supreme Court. THE Grand Forks Herald, The Grand Forks News, The Fargo Argus, The Fargo Forum and some of the lesser fights of the Republican press, are en gaged in making a United States Sena tor (on paper), without any regard to the incoming sc-ssion ot the Legisla ture, the rights of the members there of, or their opinions in the premises. I'o is all well enough to discuss the merits of candidates at the proper lime, but all this hue and cry now, and tbe starting of an excitement at this incipient stage, augurs no good for the Republican party. Feelings of bitter ness axe being engendered that will have its effect when the time comes for *ution that bodes no good to tbe suc cess of Republicanism. Members elect to the Legislature are being flooded With these publications and an attempt made to "influence" them in their ac tion as legislators for this or that in dividual. North Dakota has plenty of good timber for a United Slates Sena tor and we have faith enough in the Republicanism of the members elect of the Legislature to use some of it in filling the place in tbe Senate.
