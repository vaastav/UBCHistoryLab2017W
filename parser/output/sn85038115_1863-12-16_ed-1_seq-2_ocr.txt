The maritime jurisdiction of Cuba, which has been discussed between the United Suites and Spain, is a education to he referred to the arbitrament of a foroign power. Tho Scheldt dues are to be paid. It is recommended that a list of all the porous declaring their intention ot become citizens of the United States be forwarded to the Secretary oi the Interior, and that a law be passed for that purpose. It is also recommended that, the 1 ,ivv bo so ciin ged as to make the fact of voting: a bar against any claim of no citietishpi'jset up by those who desire an exemption from military service, Russia is to make a line of telegraph from our Paeihc coast.

Shades of the Samter, Alabama and (jleorgia, what do you think of thiu amazing declaration?

He o tiers a full pardon to those concerned in the rebellion, provided the will take an oath to faithfully support, protect and defend the Constitution ol the Uritcd Status and the l nion uuder it aud abide by and support all laws of Con-gie.-.s, aud all proclamations relative to slavery, so long as they are not modified er declared void by the Supreme Court of the United States, (which Court will be reorganized under hs Administration.) He excepts a large number of persons from this act of grace. He also promises that whenever in the seceded States oiu ienth of the voters of the Preside nth-.! elec- tion of 1860 shall take this oath, above :,lluded to. and shall establish a republic an form of government, he will recognise Mich States as agninin the Union. We thought that' in tbe estimation of the President and his party, the Southern States have never been out of the Union; but here we find that they have got to u'u thruu.'h a somewhat singular change i.i order to be in a position they have never left! The scheme is as crude and unconstitutional afl it is impolitic, lu atdad of having the effect of dividing and ililtracung the South, this Proclamation serve to unite and combiud it togeth er. It will ho a tremendous dead weight lor the Union men of the South to carry, nd is very questionable whether any oi then, will ever undertake to do so. A Proclamation, offering the benefits of the oid Luton and Constitution to thore who would lay down their arms in a given lime and return to the old alle giance, might have helped our arms ma terially ; but this restoration ofthc Union Sit it was, the administration is as much opposed to as the Secessionists. It is bound not to have the . old Union. Its main oblect is not to restore the Union. ' but to abolish slavery, and to that end ii inposes upon t tic Lnion .nun oi ineiol tlie U uited estates, it is proviueu uui South the Emancipation Proolamatien as ' the PreHcUI shall have power to grant a test, which is most abhorcnt and dis- gustiog to their feelings and ; their iutrists.
