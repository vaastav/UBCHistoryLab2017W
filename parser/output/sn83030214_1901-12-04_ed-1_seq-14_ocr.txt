The stock market was strong and active in the • greater part of the day. with net gains in the •greater number of issues at the close. In the -early dealings irregularity «ma the leading feat ure, but in the subsequent transactions prices • generally advanced under buying influenced by ! the President's Message. Net gains for the day , would donMlen have been larger had it not been • for a decline in Amalgamated Copper in the last Hour, which had a sympathetic effect on the entire list. The decline in Amalgamated Copper i-ivas based on ■ report of a Montana decision favorable to the interests opposing the company. The stock declined to 71%. the lowest price on •record. The close shewed a slight recovery at :72 a net loss for the day of 1% points. Else where among the list of active securities ad- Vanees were generally recorded, although the. ■•maximum improvement for the day was offset in the last dealings by heavy selling throughout the list. Manhattan, however, was an exception ho the general selling movement, its closing price 'being only a small fraction under its best point 'of the day. Other noteworthy strong features v.-ere the United States Steel shares. Norfolk and TTialriTl Baltimore and Ohio. Rock Island. Con solidated Gas and a number of the industrial issues. There was nothing in the President's Message -that alarmed Wall Street. Indeed, his remarks *in affairs affecting corporate Interests were roundly applauded in every banking house in the Street. And, in fact, every recommendation In his message was cordially approved by the financial community. President Roosevelt is carrying out the policy of William McKinley, ard in following the wise and conservative course of his predecessor he will find in all busl- BBSa and financial circles hearty support, encour agement and goodwill. Industrial combinations are the outcome cf industrial evolution in this country, and President Roosevelt recognizes that the tendency Of the times should be controlled only by safeguards that protect the public Inter ests and the public weal. He recommends pub licity. In the last few months industrial com binations have shown a disposition to make pub lic the results of their operations, and the pros pects are that at no remote period the industrial corporations will publish frequent reports of their affairs, giving the stockholders all legiti mate news of their financial progress. According to the beat informed opinion in Wall Street, based perhaps on the recommendations in ■ vi,. President's Message, there will be no im portant legislation against industrial combina tions at this session of Congress. The greater number of industrial companies have nothing to rear Cor the simple reason that their organiza tions are not based on conditions opposed to the Sherman Anti-Trust law. It would be hard to fvn<-i a company among the new industrial com binations that can restrain trade or kill competi tion. In yesterday's market the industrial se curities wore strong and active as a result of the treatment of trusts in President Roosevelt's mes sage to Congress. American Car and Foundry stocks were bought, by a good class of traders, ■while there was an excellent demand for a num ber of other well known issues. The greater rumber of industrial shares are selling well un der th«Mr actual worth, and the prospects are that In the course of the next few months they ■will Mb in demand at much higher quotations. .Mary people have deferred buying these issues on the absurd idea that industrial combinations are to ac smashed by act of Congress. The local money market showed no material change In yesterday's operations, while sterling ex change was a trifle lower, owing to offerings of bills against yesterday's gold engagements. It ' Is generally believed that further exports of the metal will he made, but there is no uneasiness in banking circles over the money market situa tion. Money is coming to this centre from the interior, and It is quite likely that the advance , in money rates in the last' two days will acceler ate the movement of funds from the Weft. Tin-:
