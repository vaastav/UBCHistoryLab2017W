I>ec. 1,—The first car of coal mined by the volunteer min ers in thc strip pits of this field was billed out of Pittsburg this afternoon. It went to the mayor of Cold water, Kan. Other cars will be ready by night. In the face of a blizzard that ordinarily would have called a halt to work in the strip pit mines of the Pittsburg coal field, the volunteer coal diggers of Kan sas went into the pits when the whistles blew for work, this morning, and began turning out fuel to relieve the Kansas coal famine. The volunteer workers, most of thean accustomed to the outdoor life during service overseas, slept in tents with frigid winds whistling around the cor ners and sifting sleet and snow through rifts in the canvas or through cracks about the doorways. This morning the men washed in ice water and ate break fast bundled up in overcoats, ear muffs, and gloves. Concerned over the welfare of his coal volunteers, Governor Allen arrived here early for a conference with Adjutant General Charles I. Martin and Colonel P. M. Iïoisington, who are in charge of the state's forces in >the field. For the most part the volunteer work ers are young men active in the business life of their respective towns.

Washington, Dec. 2.—General recom mendations on legislation to combat the cost of living, labor unrest, radicalism and a readjustment of the nation to peace time basis were the features of President Wilson's annual message to congress.

His Chief Points. The president's principal recommen dations were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation system with simplification of the income and excess profits. Redajustmeut of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world condi tions and make the system conform with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world." Recognition and relief for veteran sol diers of the world war, particularly in the way of government farms as pro posed by Secretary Lane. Rural Community Forms. Proper measures to foster the dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farmers' part in the war Measure which "will remove the causes" of "political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the un rest "are superficial rather than deep seated" and that they "arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to arrive speedily at. a 1 just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal conditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European centers pending such . delay, from heartless profiteering re- j

Boasted His Identity. From ranch house to ranch house through the desolate I.aramie Peak country Carlisle made his way, never attempting to conceal his identity, rather boasting of it. It was said that Carlisle's wound is not necessarily fatal. He will be kept under guard in the local hospital f>>r several days and then taken back to the state penitentiary at Rawlins. Large sums were spent in trying to trace the source of letters and tele grams sent to the Cnion Pacific aivl to newspapers purporting to come from Carlisle. It now proves that all of these were fakes. - fef suiting from the increase of the cost of living and. lastly, from the machina tions of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to_ normal conditions this unrest will rapidly dis appear." Rights of Labor Discussed. The president renewed his recom legislatioii to deal af t.ively with "those persons who by violent, methods would abrogate our , time-tested institutions." -* ; Several recommendations, some re neW;lls 0 f previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among I hem were extension of the food control law to peace times for the emergency: regulations for trans portation of foods in interstate com merce; a cold storage law modelled at'ter the law in New Jersey, a iaw re quiring marks to show the length of time foods are kept in storage and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent uncoostitutionable profits." by federal license of corporations selling food in interstate commerce. A long portion of the message was de voted to a discussion of the conditions and rights of labor. "A definite .program to bring about an improvement in the conditions of labor" and "bring about a genuine democratization "f industry" was recommended Remove Grivances, He Urges, "The only way to keep men from agi tating against grievances is to remove the grievances," said the president's mes sage. At another point it declared "the seed of revolution is repression." "The establishment of the principles regarding lab<»r. laid down in the cove nant of the league of nations," said the message, "offers us the way to indus trial peace and conciliât ion. No other road lies open to us. *♦»*»** Govern ments must, recognize the right of men to bargain collectively fi>r humane ob jects. »**«** Labor no ionger must be treated as a commodity. "The right of individuals to strike is inviolate," continues the message, "and ought not to be interferred with by any process of government, but there i< a predominant right and that is the right (Continued from Page One ) for was hi Mi an> There h I W st rike 1 W. » days CoMft.

Russia Painful Example. The president was referring to the. government's recent injunction against the coal strike. The message closed with a pointed ref erence to radicalism and red doctrines and referred to "Russia today with blood and terror" as a "painful object lesson of the power of minorities." ^ "There are those in this country." said the message, "who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. * * * It makes little difference what minority it is. whether capital or labor, or any other class, no sort of privilege will ever be permitted to dominate this country." Orderly processes, the message rlc clared, were the only ones by which re lief and reform could be obtained. "Those who would propose any other methods of reform are enemies of this country." the message said. "Let those beware who take the shorter road of disorder and revolution."
