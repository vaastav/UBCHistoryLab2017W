n - U i 3tl)eliansas tfl)Uf. SOL. MILLER, ----- EDITOR. WHITE CLOUD, KANSAS: Thirsday, : r December 9, I8G. Inportaat aad Risbceoos Dcela Ion. , The Pott Office Department bit made a decision which 1 rather tough on those country papers which print only one tide at home, tbe other tide being printed in some 'distant city. The decision is, that those papers cannot be considered as be ing printed in the County where isirned, Sbofare only partly so, and therefore .tbeyeanoot go to subscriber in the Coun ty free of postage, as papers do that are wholly printed in tbe Coonty. Here is the decision: ."County papers remit be printed and pnbliabed in the Oonnty, lo permit them to pass through mails nnder section 151, lairs of 1866. A paper, one-half of which is printed in another Connty, does not come within the meaning of this sec- tion." i- fVfo era glad of this decision. It may ha( m aniti tinr tn ttfMiKar ttiA o. :,- .read-but one country paper; but to news- " paper editors, wbo receive from a dozen ' to twenty papers, the ontsides of which . are sll exactly alike, it is a great nois- " ence. Folly one-third, of the papers in ,:,tbe West are now got np in this way; and as they all come from three establish- v merits, located at Chicago, Milwaukee, , ior Belleville, Illinois, there is not mocb variety in them. The matter is nnexcep' .tionable, and generally well selected, bnt it is too much of a good thing. Bat tbe greatest evil connected with this system is, that it is mining the for. eign advertisiog patronsge of tbe conntry papers. Tbe offices supplying these printed ootsides or insides, reserve tbe ;'rigbt of inserting a given number of col lt, pains of advertisement, for which tbey recaive pay. They then contract with tbe heavy advertisers and advertising , agents of tbe East, for their advertise " tnents to be inserted in a specified number of country papers throughout the West. . Tbey are enabled to put down tbe rates very low for each paper; and tbe result - is, that tbe advertisers do not contrsct for their advertisements in country papers ;L outside of the list furnished by these men; or, if they do, the country publisher who . is endeavoring to do a legitimate busi- c'ness, is compelled to take the advertise- f ment at tbe reduced wholesale rales of the f patent newspaper outside furnishers. Tbe publisher wbo uses these ontsides' receives nothing for the advertisiog, and parties who do their own work do not get ' tbe advertisements. , y" This is tbe way in nliich country news- . paper publishing is being broken down; f forsny botch and adventurer can publish V a newspaper, by getting tbe work done "in some Eastern city. To convince any one of what class of printers publish pa- . pen printed in this-way, let him pick up '; one of tbe sheets, and examine tbe neat and 'tasteful appearance of tbe outside, that comes ready printed' from the East, tben turn to the miserable, mackled, blur ntred. crooked and unreadable columns " printed at borne. A "wbited sephulchre" is lovely beside ill m Bear Heard From. J. K. Bear, tbe ' absconding Express Agent from Brown .. ville, bag written a letter from California, in' which be expresses deep regret for what bis has done.. He says that be stole the money, because be bad met with heavy losses by gambling; bnt that be is now v' a iking ' money rapidly, and intends to refund every cent be stole. He says he :"dropped 88,600 of tbe stolen money in tba Missouri River accidentally. He winds np by saying that be is leading a miserable existence an outcast from friends, and not knowing but that at any boar he may be arrested and taken to i prison. He does not give bis location, bnt be is probably stopping with bis re latives, tbe Gritzly Bears. W The papers are pitching into the St. Joseph and Denver Railroad heavily, in consequence of whoppers told in an advertisement which they bave published in New York, offering mortgage bonds for - aale. Tbe advertisement says that tbe in- . teres t is paid srmi-annnelly in gold, and that the bonds ara exempt from United , States taxes; that tbe road ia completed --tsmd ib roceeeaful operation for 41 miles; that ths line to Uarysville is being rap . idly completed; that tbe line from Marys - vills to to Fort Kearney is also being rap idly pushed forward; and that a branch i 'road ia being boilt from Severance to con aaect with tba Kansas Pacific Railroad I This ia worse than a lottery or gift en terprise swindle.

Richardson has died of the wound inflicted by Daniel McFarland 'died tbe death be provoked, and appar ently conrted. Tbe'reading public- will not soon obtain a fair history of the affair. They will be made to believe that Richardson was an unoffending saint, and McFarland a col.l-bloodeJ murderer. All the avenues of information, with a fiw rare exceptions, are prejudiced in behalf of Richardson. He was the em ployee or tho boon companion of the leading newspaper editors, the reporters, anJ the news agents, throughout the country. From tbe moment he was shot, thia " ring" set to work to manu facture public opinion against McFar land, and will continue to do so nntil be is hanged. Never has there been a more labored attempt to make a sensation and manu facture public sentiment, than there hae been in this case. Dispatches were daily and almost hourly tent to tbe press, an nouncing his condition, as if be were a benefactor of mankind, and his death would cause tbe world to stand still. It was aaid that the docto-s had prescribed absolute quiet and freedom from-aIl ex citement, as necessary to bis safety. Yet there poured in upon him messages-'of condolence in showers from Vice-President Colfax, who is regarded as- a pat tern of virtue and propriety ; from news paper editors and correspondents all over tbe country; from Pullman, whose sleeping-cars bad been well puffed by Rich ardson ; and from tbe clown, George Francis Train and these messages were again telegraphed to the press, as a por tion of tbe daily news. Dr. Ayer took this means to advertise his Pectoral and Pills ; and tbe only nnaccountahle cir cumstance is, that Helmbold did not em brace the oppoitonity to give his Bucliu a lift. One or tvvo "seeds" sent ac counts of instances they knew, wheroin men had recovered from prccinely similar wounds, as if tbey would have auy effect on Richardson's case. To contribute to the essential quiet, and allay excitement, a mockery of marriage was got up be tween R:cbardson and Mrs. McFarland, which required the united services of two big-gnn of the pnlpit, no less persona ges than Henry Ward Beelher and O B. Frothingham, encouraged and urged on by the ring of claquera and manufac turers of public opinion, while tbe only man wbo would have forbidden the bans was helpless in prison. And this scan dalous affair was telegraphed to the press, of course. That Richardson was a man of talent, with many good qualities, no one will deny ; and this unfortunate affair is to be rrgrctleJ. Bnt there has a miserable sen-. timent grown np, and ia fostered and en' couraged by the press, that if a man bas talent and genius, he may be allowed to indulge in any amount of vice and crime, which must not be exposed. The talent ed debauchee or libertine may violate all the decencies of life, or invade tbe roojt s'acred rights of o'hers, and the person who undertakes to expose birn is booted don and lashed mercilessly ; but when tbe "wayward genius" meets with mer ited puniahment at the hand of one whom he has wronged, he is held up to the world as a saint and martyr, while tbe unfortunate mortal who has avenged' his own wrongs is execrated as a bruto and a murderer. The funeral of Richardson was con ducted on tbe same scale as tbe other proceedings connected with the affair. The worthy pair, Frothingham and the pnlpit demagogue, Beecher, officiated. In bis remarks, Beecber declared that he positively knew what it was utterly im possible for him to know that Richard son was innocent of any wrong in his connection with the McFarlands. This, of course, was a part of the game of fore stalling public opinion, in order to make it impossible to obtain a jury that bave not already made op their minds to hang McFarland. There is a declaration dis tinctly made by Christ at several differ ent times, which Beecber did not quote on tbis occasion ; for it does not tally with a transaction which he had so lately as- fitted in consummating. As Christ came to supersede theMosa;c Dispensation, to we suppose Beecher thinks bis mission is to supersede Christ ; therefore" be did not preach from tbis lext from tbe immortal Sermon on tbe Mount : " Whosoever shall marry her that is dirore ed, committeth adultery." X3"P The principal objection in Eng land to a law compelling all children to attend school is, that if tbey leave off work for that purpose they will starve. Wages ara so low that parents are com pelled to rely on wages of children of ten der years for tbe support of tbe family. Ex. That is jutt wbat tbe advocates'of Free Trade are working for in thia conntry. They would rafose protection to home manufacturers, leaving them to compete with English goods produced at starva tion wages. Tbe resnlt would be, a re duction of wages at bome, to be followed by over-work of children, neglect of echo!, ignorance, and the long train of crimes growing therefrom. George H. Hoy t bas resigned the office of Special Mail Agent on account of rheumatism, the papers, say. Proba bly tba politicians will secure tba ap pointment of a man equally aa bad to fill the place in which cue, Hoyt may aa well bava kept it. . Extsact. Faou a Letter Faou Santa Cboix. We bad wandered for many hours through tangled forests of Tropical shrubs and trees, anme of them emitting a most delicious and invigorat ing odor, when we autdenly came upon a large and well cultivated plantation, in the centre of which were several buildings. Entering tbes- we fonnd them to be-tbe "pre house," stills. S-c, where the su gar cane is crashed for tbe manufacture or St. Croix Rum. Over 100 Coolies were at work, and the smell from tbe fer menting vats was very exhilarating and pleasant. We wera shown through tbe entire establishment, and learned that all the Rum bere produced was shipped to Messrs. P. H. Drake & Co , New York, to be made into their celebrated Planta tion B-tters. The peculiar good effects of tbis Rom which ia tbe purest end best in the world are well-known. Not a single esse of Dyspepsia, Fever and Agne, Consnmption, or any such disease can be found on tbis Inland, (.except of invalids come bere for their health, and they are almost always cured). Com bined with -Calisaya- Bark, Cascirilla, and other important ingredients, .tbis Rum becomes Plantation Bitters; and surely no finer Tonic and general Family Remedy was ever seen. The combina tiou of-these Bitters was first discovered here many years ago, and all the Natives swear by Plantation iiitters. ana say "there is nothing like it." Judging by the robust health of the witnesses, I am certain "their testimony Is true. R. S.T. Magvolia Water. Superior to tbe best imported German Cologne, and sjldathalf the price. "SojiethisoDifferest." In a crowd. not long since, when the conversation was about killing bogs, a large hog rais er remarked that he always threw the ribs and back-bones away. "Why, I think they are tbe best part about a hog," spoke up an old fellow silting by, "Well, I alvays throw them away," re plied the other. Tbe old fellow said if that was the case, he would be on hand the next time be killed, and get some of tbem; and inquired when he expected to kill again. The hog man told him; and bright and early on the appointed day, tbe old chap was on hand, with a sack to carry away the plunder. As be took out tbe ribs and back-bones, the butcher threw them on a pile to one side, when tho other commenced poking them 4nto his sack. "Hold on, there; what are you about?" asked the proprietor. "Why," replied tbe man with tbe sack, "you said yon always threw the ribs snd back-bones away." "So 1 do," rejoined the other; "bnt I cut tbe meat off of them first! Sack-man saw the poiut, and took his leave. Dreadful! The papers are filled with terrible things. There has been a human holocaust in Dakota; a demirep has been killed in Indiana; a man in Philadelphia has proved un alibi ; they have held an autopsy of a dead man in New York ; a man in Chicago bas committed uxori cide; Richardson, after be was shot, made an ante-mortem statement ; a schism has broken out in one of the leading Church es ; an Ecumenical Council will be held in Rome, in a few dayi, and perhaps the Pope will issue an encyclical letter ; a dog in Missouri is given to matutinal exercises; there is a serious imbroglio in the Red River country, up north ; the atrocities of the Skoptzi are attracting attention in Russia; one of the Eastern Magazines threatens io get up something recherche these are not the thoussndtb part of tbe awful things that are taking place every day. Specie Payments. The other day. we happened to come across a silver half- dollar that we bad laid away as a cori osity, some yosrs ago ; and on opening oar purse, wo fonnd that, by a strange coincidence, there was just one solitary fifty-cent currency stamp inside. We have been seriously considering the que tiou, ever since, whether, if we should sink that stamp away, and put the silver ia circulation in its stead, it wonld cause a very great money panic I tSf The papers are about through eu logizing George Peabody, who was rich, and made a big noise with his money. But not one of them bss preached a ser mon from the most appropriate text that can be found in Scripture to meet his care: "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." A quantity of the Initiative Journals of Kansas, and a portion of tbe Adjutant-General's Report, were burned in tha lata Topeka fire. Last Winter's Legislative proceedings bava a hard time of it.

(Richardson, ia entitled to soma little sympathy, or at least to a moiety of pity. He ia some twenty years older than 'his wife.'bntbia years do not out number, bars any mora Mo-day tbtn tbey ii wheffahe toaried aiaa, and tba fact thererbre-formeao excuse for bef action. H may have treated her badly, bnt tbia waa bo reason why aha should desert him in order tojbrow berself into the arena of another man. She states, h. h said, that be was in the habit of drinking and thea of abnsins; her; but his statement Je that they lived happily together until he lost hia property, aqd tbeoheramWtfoa waa beyond her pecuniary means. -Whilifeba was yetliviu" witbhim, it is well known, Richardson waa much mortfiatiafata with her th'sn -he should have been'. After aba had IcfLhim be believes tba two etntiaaed their intimacy, and' this suppostion waa not calculated excessively to dear th nervesofau excitable 'msn. Finallvana got from him bis two children, aad for some time he could find neither ber'nor them. He got bis boy back, but tbe lit tie one cried every night for bis motbar, who could not bo fonnd. Richardson published a letter in which be avowed his determination to marry Mrs. McFar land jnet as soon aaahe could get a di vorce from her husband. At last, aa Mo Farland believed, tha divorce waa ob tained in an Indiana conrt, and it waa an derstood that Riebsrdson 'waa selling hia property in New Jersey, calculating to marry the woman and take her with Iiim to California. Evidently McFarlandhad brooded upon the subject until it becmaa the study of his life. The knowledge that tha woman he had loved would soon bo lost to htm beyond redemption, drova him frantic, and the trigedy in tha Tri bune office qnirkly followed. Thie is the side of the "tory which demands sym pathy for tbe prisoner, and in view of it we cannot discover the juttica of tho malediction showered upon hint by soma of tbe New York journals, and tha calls that are made for his blood, merely that Richardson may be avenzed. We can imagine nothing more grievioos than tba disgrace which has been heaped npoa McFarland and bis children, and the mora terrible because it comes from .tbe woman it is bis unhappy fate to love; but at tba same time there ia nothing more nnwise, aa well as cowardly, than bia two attempts to murder tbe destroyer of bis peace. Plac ed in tho ahoes of Richardson, 'there ara few men who wonld not bava acted pre cisely as be did, and thought such action manly in a certain way; hut at tbeaama time he and the wife of McFarland ara as amenable to the law as tbe wronged husband ia. and they can be pnnished if it is proved that they have broken it. The prisoner ia brutal; bnt there is some thing in lb- action nf Ms wife and her scdncer which is deliberately, crully heartless. We certainly hope that Mo Farland will be punished to the fnll ex tent of the lw; hut wo cannot joia in tbe effort which is being made to give the man who has wronged him tha dignity of a martyr.- ittarrietV At the residence of tba bride's- father, in Forest City, Mo., on the 30th-day of'Novem ber, by Rev.
