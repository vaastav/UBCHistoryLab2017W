As one among the first to suggest the name of General Grant as the standard bearer of the Republican part', we point with pride to his Annual Message, which appears in full iu the Republican. Its patriotic tone, practical recommendations, dignified and yet simple style, puts to shame his infamous slanderers and detainers, and those, whose stock of political knowledge seems to consist in their favorite and sneering remark, "Grant can't make a speech," will be forced to acknowledge that he writes witn an ability that would elicit the highest commendations from such writers as Addison and Wirt, and exhibits such familiarity with the practical workings of the various de partments and wants of the country, that the great soldier has shown to the world that he is also emphatically a sagacious and noble statesman. We heartily congratulate the friends of the President, for he has proved himself worthy of more than all they have ever said in his justification and praise. The nation learned with profonn sorrow of the sad death of Hon. Horace Greeley which occurred last Friday evening. At the begining, of Ihe recent Presidential canvass, Mr. Greeley embarked in a political ca rter which elicited from his country men unfavorable comments and end cd iu such overwhelming defeat and crushing rebuke, that together with the recent loss of his wife, so wreck ed his mind and body as to result in his death as related elsewhere. The reader c ;n form some idea of the terrible condition of Mr. Greeley's mind from the following heart-rending expressions, which are reported as hia last words: "The country is gone, the Tri bune is gone, and I am gone." The Cincinnati Gazette concludes an editorial on the life and death of Mr. Greeley as follows : Withoutdoubt Mr. Greeley's death was caused by mental anxiety in this contest, by disappointment, and by ins realization or" the terrible sacri fice he had ma le of himself. In the presence of this awful tragedy there can be no feeling but pity. Sudden death from accident or from the hand an assassin is a blessing com par with this dcstxuctioti of a strong life by mental agony.' The universal ex prcssion, when Mr. Greeley's dan gerous illness and loss of reason was reported, was a shock of the sensi bilities, and a fervent hope for his recovery and his restoration to journalism. The universal feeling at his death will be pity for his mis fortune, profound compassion for the mental suffering which this tragic end reveals, kindly recollections for the great service he has done to hu manity, and heartfelt regret that a man with capacities so great has de tarted.

VICTORY. Indiana has thrown herself in the breach, and will save the Union from the further administration of General Grant. She lias elected hendricka Governor by 2,000 majority, with a majority in the Legislature, thus de featiug the rotten Moxv Morton for United Stales Senator. Let the men of Ohio take courage and pre pare for the fight in November. Wyandot Democratic Union, Octo ber 10th 1872. The Legislature of Indiana yester day re-elected Oliver P.

Mr. Morton hpd six majority in the Senate and ten majority in the House, or sixteen on joint ballot, being the full Ecpub lican vote in both houses. Mr. juorion is an aoie senator ana a staunch Republican, and carried In diana in the late canvass largely by his personal popularity and the elo quence and force of his public 8 3eech es.

Evert publisher, no matter what his political tenets may be, will cor dially agree with H . G. iu the fol lowing sensible remarks : it is strange now closely men read the papers. Wc never say any: thing that auy body ' don't like, but we soon hear of it. - If, however, we once in a while happen to say a good thing, we never hear of that ; nobody seems to hear of that. We may pay some men a hundred compliments and give him a dozen putts and he takes it as a tribute to his greatness aud never thinks of it, never thinks it does him any good . But if we happen to say something this man don't like, or something he imagines a reflection on bim or his character, sec how quick he flares up and sets mad about it All oureviis are dai ly charged to us. but we never, ap parently, get any credit for what good we do ." AN -ADDEESS. . BT TUB United States 0NTxNNIAL OMMISSION. To Iht reoplnoflhe United Sliles. The Congress of the United States has enacted that the completion of the One. Hundredth Year of Ameri can independence shall be celebrated by an International ' Exhibition of the Arts, Manufactures, and Products of the soil and mine, to be held at Philadelphia, in 1S7G, and has ap pointed a Commission, consisting of rapresentatives from each State and Territory, to conduct tho celebra tion. Originating under the auspices ot the National Legislature, controlled by a National Commission, and de signed as it is to ''Commemorate the first Ceutury of our existence, by an Exhibition of the Natural resources of the Country and their develop ment, and ot our progress in those Arts which benefit mankind, in comparison with those of older Na tions," it is to tho people at large that the Commission look for the aid which is necessary to make the Cen tennial Celebration the grandest an niversary the world has ever seen. That the completion of the first century of our existence should be marked by some imposing demon stration is. we believe, the patriotic wish of the whole country, The Congress of the United States has wisely decided that the Birth-day of the Great Sepublic can be most fit tingly celebrated by the universal collection and display of all the tro phies of its progress. It is designed to bring together, within a building covering fifty acres, not only the var ied productions of our mines and of the soil, but types of all the intellec tual triumphs of our citizens, speci mens of everything that America can furnish, whether from the brains or the hands of her children, and thus make evident to the world the advancement of which a self govern ed people is capable. In this "Celebration" all nation? will be invited to participate; its character being International. Eur ope will display her arts and manu factures,, India her curious fabrics, while newly opened China and Japan will lay bare the treasures which for centuries their ingenious people have been perfecting. Each land will complete in generous rivalry for the palm of superior excellence. To this grand gathering every zone wil contribute its fruits ' and cereals. No mineral shall be want ing; tor what the East lacks the West will supply Under one roof will be the South display in rich lux miancc her growing cotton, and the North in miniature, the ceaseless machinery of her mills converting that cotton into cloth. Each section of the globe will send its best offer ings to this exhibition, and each State of the Union, as a member of one united body politic, will show to her sister States and to the world, how much she can add, to the great ness of the nation of which she is a harmonious part. To make the Centennial Celebra tion such a success as the patriotism and the pride of every American de mands will require the co-operaton of tho people of the whole country. The Uuited States Ceutenuial Com mission has received no Government aid, such as England extended to her World's .Fair, and France to her Universal Exposition. -et the labor and responsibility imposed upon tue Commission is as great as in either of those undertakings. It is estima ted that ten millions of dollars will be required, and this sum "Congress s provided shall be raised by stock subscription, and that the people shall have the opportunity of sub scribing in proportion to the popu lation ot their respective Slates and Territories. The Commission looks to the un failing patriotism of the people of every section, to see that each con tributes' its share to the expenses, and receives its share of the benefits of an enterprise in which all are so deeply interested. It would further earnestly urge the formation in each Slate and Territory of a centennial organization, which shall in time see that county associations are formed. so that when the nations are gathered together in 1876 each Commonwealth can view with pride the contribu tions she has made to the national glory. Confidently reiving on the zeal and patriotism ever displayed by our people in every national undertaking we pledge and prophecv. that the Centennial Celebration will worthily show how greatness, wealth and in telligence cao be lostereit bvsueh in stil utions as those which have for one hundred years blessed the people of tuts United States. JOSEPH R. HAWLEY, President. LEWIS WALN SMITH, Temporary Secretary. FUNERALS. During the prevalence of tha horse epidemic it will be found dilHcult to bury the dead. The time is a good one, therefore, to introduce the New York system of private funerals that is to say, of having the remains attended to the cemetery by the fam ily of the deceased only. The pres ent practice here is a heavy tax upon the poor, but it must be broken up, iT broken up at all, by those who are not poor. A notion, devoid of sense prevails that, to show proper respect to the dead, there must be long fun eral trains, and the sorrow of the living is supposed to be measured by the number of carriages. There fore when a hearse is followed by only three or six carriages, it is sup posed that the dead has few friend to mourn, or that those friends are poor. This keeps alive the extrava gance. The rich practice it. The poor follow the example. Thus the average cost of funerals in this city is over one hundred dollars. This is far more than three fourth of the living can afford for burying the dead Besides, it is a senseless. A large proportion of those who ride to funerals are not mourners. They go for the sake of the rida. They enjoy it, They go to the funerals for tho love of the thing, and r.ot be cause they mourn the dead or sym pathize with the living family. Necessity now puts a stop to this practice. Let the good sense of the people continue the improvement when the present necessity shall have ceased. The wife of Horace Greeley was recently interred in Greenwood Cemetery, New York. The funeral services were at the church, and sub sequcntly the remains were follow ed to the grave by the family and the pall bearers only. Most frequently the services aro conducted at the house of the deceased, and on the same or the following day the re mains are interred. Thus real mourners are permitted to do in pri vate what with us is a public exhibit ion, and which, from practice, has be come a heavy tax, burdening those who can not afford it. Another senseloss practice, in this connection, is the costly caskets that are used. There n one class of peo ple who have not fallen into this, and their examf le is worthy of imi tation. The Jews use coffins con structcd of material as delicate as it can be made to hold together. This is covered with plain materiall, gen erally black cloth. The idea is to permit the remains to mingle at once with the earth. This is certainly more pleasant to contemplate than the repugnant one suggested by an air tight metallic casket. The Jewish custom has prevailed from early ages. Oars is the out growth of fashion and folloy, as is also tho custom of erecting costly monuments is cemeteries. If people would usethe mono' which theywaste in funerals displays and expend upon monuments unnecessarily costly, up on worthy objects or charity, a vast amount of good would be established and practices would be abolished that are a disgrace to our boasted civilization.

GREELEY DEAD- His Illness aud Last Hours, New ore, November 29. 3 :30 p. m Mr. Greeley has been in a state of almost entire uncon sciousness since eight o clocK this morning. His pulse at the wrist is mperceptible, and his strength stead ily failing. He appears to suffer very little. 9 p. m Horace Greeley died conscious and peacefully at 6:50 p. at. The Tribune issues the following bulletin : "November 29, 8 p. m Greeley died very quietly, and with out pain, at ten miuutes before seven this evening. He was conscious and rational." MR. GREELEY'S ILLXESS AXD LAST HOURS The New York Tribune furnishes the following account of the illness and last hours of Mr. Greeley. So far as any of his associates knew, Mr. Greeley was in almost as good health as usual, when, on the day af ter the election, he wrote his card announcing his resumption of edi torial charge of the Tribune. His sleeplessness was known to have be come greatly worse, but for years he had suffered more or less from the same difficulty and, as is now clear. sufficient allowance had not been made for the intense strain upon him throughout the summer, especially during the month of his wife's illness. But it noon became evident that his strength was unequal to the hard task to which he set himself. He wrote only three or four careful ar ticles, one of them half a column in length. The most notable, perhaps. was that entitled "Conclusions," wherein ho summed up his views of the canvass. In all, he wrote less than three and a half columns after his return, contributing to only four issues of the paper. Two or three limes he handed his assistant short articles, saying, ' There is an idea worth using, but I haven't felt able to work it out properly. You had better put it iii shape." At last, on Tuesday, 12lh inst., he abandoned the cflert to visit the office regularly aud sent for the family physician ol Mr. A. J Johnson, the friend with whom he was a guest, and in whose house his wife had died. An effort was made to induce sleep, but he grew steadily worse until it became evident that his case was critical. Dr. Geo. S. Choate and others were called in consultation, and finally it was decided to take him to Dr. Choate's residence, two or three miles distant, from Greeleys own country house, at Chappaqua. Here he received the nnintcrmilling atten tion of Drs Choate, Brown, and Srquad. Dr. Brown and others were called in consultation. The iu somauia had developed into in flam nation of the brain, and under this the enervated patient rapidly sank At times he was de irious, at other times as clear headed as ever. He lost flesh and strength with startling rapidity, and in a few days percepti bly his speedy death forced itself into uuwilliug recognition. It was not. however, until thursday that his as sociates and family brought them selves to admit it. Even then they ! still clung to his faiih in the vigor of his constitution. . On Wednesday night he failed very rapidly, lhurs day afternoon and evening he seem ed somewhat easier. During the night he slept very uneasy, mutter ing occasionally and frequently rais ing his right hand. Toward mom ing he was more quiet, and between eight and nine o'clock he fell into nearly unconscious coudition. which continued, with some intervals. through the day. He made occas ional exclamations, but many of t hem in Consequence of his extreme weak ness, and apparent in ability to finish what he begun, were unintelligible Ahout noon, however, he said quite distinctly, and with some loice "J know that my Redeemer liveth" Dur lag the ilay he recognized various people, his daughter many times the members ot his household at Ciitippaqua, Mr John Ii Stuart and Mr. liicd. On the whole ho suffered little seemed to have no more than the ordinary resstlcsaless which ac companies the last stage of the dis ease. During the day his- extremi ties were cold, and there was no pulse at the wrist; the action of the heart was very intermittent and con stantly diminishing in fore. He had not askod for water or been willing to drink it since his stay at Dr. Choate'a but during Friday be asked for it frequently, and up to within half an hour of the end ho manifested in various ways hia consciousness of what was going on around him. and even answsred in, raonosvlables and intelligently questions addressed to him. About half past three he said very distinctly, It is done!'' and be yond the briefest answers to ques tions, tnft was his last utterance His youngest daughter, Miss. Gabrielle, was with Lira throughThiirsdaj- even ing. Throughout Friday tho elder dough' er, Miss Ida, was in constant attendance as she had been during the whole of his illness, and that of Mrs. Greeley before him. Other members of his Cliappnqua house hold were present, with Mr. and Mrs John It. Stuarts, and a few other friends. Nothing that science or alTcction could suggest wa3 wanting to case the last hours. The wintry night had fairly set iu when the ine vitable hour came. Without sleighs were running to and fro, bearing to Chappaqna, the nearest telegraph station, the latest bulletins which thousands of anxious hearts in the great city near by k ;pt demanding. Within the daughter and a few oth ers stood near the dying man, who remained conscious and seemingly rational and free from pain, thongh now too weak to speak . In the nd joining room sat one or two more friends and the physicians. At ten minutes before seven o'clock the watchers drew back in rcver2nt still ness from the bedside. The great editor was gone in peace, after so many struggles, in honor aAer so much obloquy. OFFICIAL VOTE OF OHIO.
