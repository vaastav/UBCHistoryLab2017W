MEMBERS OX THE GROUND Senator Quay's Quarters Aro Bcseigcd by Visitors from t lie Rural Districts-Officers of House of Representatives. Senate Organization Humors. Special to the Scran ton Tribune. , Washington, Dec. 1. Everything Is In readiness for the opening of the llfty-fourth congress. With the excep tion of a few Democrats all the mem bers are in town, and tilings are be ginning to present a business-like ap pearance. For the second time Thomas B. Heed, of Maine, will preside over the house. Major McDowell will be the clerk; W. J. Glenn, of New York, the doorkeeper; Ben Russell, of Mis souri, the sergeant-at-arms; Joseph C. McElroy, of Ohio, the postmaster, and Rev. Condon, of Michigan, chaplain. This slute was selected at the Repub lican caucus last night. The Demo crats nominated the old officers for the empty honors. There is much speculation as to whether or not the Republicans will organize the senate. The western Re publican senators want to do it, -but whether the eastern senators will con sider It good politics to do so remains to be seen. It was reported tonight that a conference of Republican sen ators was held at the residence of Sen ator Quay, this afternoon, but when asked about it several prominent sen ators denied all knowledge of such a meeting. It Is generally believed, however, that thet Republicans will reorganize the senate for the purpose of pushing needed legislation. The president, it is understood, will not veto any measure which will have a tendency to relieve the business Inter ests of the country. He has intimat ed as much at least. It is said that Speaker Reed will ap point two committees on contested elections for the purpose of facilitat ing business. In the llfty-first congress when Mr. Heed was speaker before, ajid when he needed every Republican member he could get there were only seventeen contests, and it was not until the fug end of the session that all of them were disposed of. Speaker Reed Is not appointing a double committee, with the view of turning Democrats out by wholesale, but for the purpose of disposing of the cares on their merits In as short a time as possible. The speaker's plnn Is being generally en dorsed by Democrats as well as Re publicans. There are twenty-nine con tests In which testimony has been filed at the clerk's office with three others in which the law has not been fully compiled with In this respect, and whioh may be wnsldered by the house after the other cases have been dis posed of. Clerk to be McDowell called on Clerk Kerr this afternoon and had an hour's talk with him regarding the duties of the office, the manner In which the of fices are distributed, etc. McDowell will not assume the duties of clerk until Tuesday, when he will file his bond and relieve Mr. Kerr of the responsi bilities of the omce. Senator Quay had scarcely arrived home this morning when his residence was beselged by political friends and office-seekers. Among his callers were Senator Penrose, Treasurer-Elect Hay wood, Congressman Acheson, State Senator Fruit, of Mercer, Deputy At torney General Elklns, .Tore Read and Editor Sam Smith, of Indiana county; State Senators Thomas and Grady, Magistrates Durham and Harrison, of Philadelphia: Representative Walter Merrick, of Tioga; Sam S. Wright, of Montrose; General Clarkson, National Chairman Carter, Senator Dubois, Fred Fleltz. of Scranton; State Sena tor Hnrdenburg, of Honesdale, and Parker L. Walter, of Pittsburg. The descent of thissmall army of politicians upon Senator Quay probably gave rise to the rumor that a conference of sen ators was being held at his residence. The usual big crowd of visitors to the capltol on opening day Is expected to morrow, Clerk of the House Kerr, who has the distribution of the tickets of administration to the galleries, has Is sued about twelve hundred paste boards, all that the galleries will ac commodate. The demand for tickets Is very heavy. Each member was given three tickets. W. R. B. NEW

Then will come the election of speaker, and the subordinate officers, in accordance with the results of the Republican caucus on Saturday night. In the hurry and con fusion of reporting the caucus, which was held behind closed doors, the vote upon the election of a clerk of the cau cus was reversed last night. Mr. W. B. Hooker, of New York, was not chosen, nor Mr. Ellis, of Oregon, his competitor. A roll call will probably be had upon the election of speaker, but the other officers, it is expected, will be named together in a resolution and the resolu tion adopted viva voce. The usual- mo tions to notify the senate and to ap point a committee to inform the presi dent, will follow. And then, if there be time remaining, the bl-ennlal lottery known as the drawing of seats will take place. Aside from the Introduction of new measures, bills, resolutions, etc., no business is anticipated this week. The adoption of new rules and the appoint ment of committees by Speaker Heed are the first matters of general Interest and Importance that will be accom plished. 

FIGHT LIKELY OVER CUBA. Right of Congress to Pass a Resolution for tho liccognitlon of Insurgents ns Belligerents Dlsputod by the Executive. Washington, Dec.l. President Cleve land will veto any Joint resolution which congress may pass recognizing the belligerency of the Cuban Insur gents. His veto will probably be of the pocket variety. The president holds the view that the recognition of a state of war In a foreign country Is a matter for the executive alone to deal with and with which congress has nothing to do. Many Republicans of both houses have announced their Intention to in troduce Joint resolutions for recognition of the belligerency of the Cubans. For eign affairs committees, even when of different politics than the executive, are usually In touch with the admin istration and on a confidential' footing at the White House. The president and Secretary Olney will endeavor to induce the committees to squelch all belligerent right resolutions, but if any measure of the sort passes the two houses, the president, if he continues In his present frame of mind, will give it a pocket veto. It Is known that the Spanish minster in Washington has had informal assurances that the presi dent denies the right of congress to deal In any authoritative manner with the question of recognition. Policy to Bo Cautiously Outlined. The president and secretary of state have taken this attitude with full knowledge of he fact that at first their position will be an exceedingly unpopu lar one, but they believe that when the facts are fully understood and the pol icy of the adminstratlon shall have had an opportunity to develop there will be a change of sentiment. In his message the president may give some hint of his Cuban programme, which is medi ation at the proper time. Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney realize that the Republicans of the house and senate may be disposed to press the Cuban agitation for v political effect. They may Conclude the easiest and sur est way to discredit the administration is by passing a resolution of recognition which the executive will have to veto. If this proves to be the case an ex ceedingly Interesting contest between the executive and congress may be brought about. The conditions are peculiar. It Is generally assumed that congress has nothing to do with foreign relations in their Initiative. This is a duty with which the president Is supposed to be charged by the constitution, but the constitution is so nearly silent on this score that the question whether the executive has the power to recognize the belligerency or the sovereignty of a foreign state Is still an open one. Precedents for Congress. Though the weight of precedent and opinion places this power In the hands of the president, there are arguments and precedents on the other side. Pres ident, Jarkson once said this right should never be exercised by the presi dent without a previous understand ing with congress. In making con gress the arbiter President Taylor fol lowed the example of President Jack son by signing a resolution of congress for recognition of the independence of Texas. Since that time recognition has been regarded as an executive preroga tive. Belgium and all the South Amer ican republics were recognized by the president. The suureme court has re peatedly held that the only adequate evidence of the existence of a new gov ernment is recognition by the execu tive. President Cleveland hns a Cuban programme of his own. -If the wintc-r campaign of Spain results in failure, he intends to offer mediation, but he has a most decided opinion that it is In no sense the proper function of con gress to Interfere in this matter, or to attempt to mnke a question of foreign relations a foot ball In the game of do mestic politics. 

MYSTERIOUS CRAFT, A Steamer Hovers About the Jersey Coast. Is It the llorsn? Cape May, N. J.. Dec. t At daylight this morning a steamer was discovered by Surfman Johnson close to the beach heading for the ocean pier. When off that point a skiff put off from shore, towing four large yawl boats, which were received by the stranger. Before her arrival a tug boat, coming from the direction of tho Delaware Breakwater, left the yawls at the pier and then quickly steamed away. Pilot Eldredge landed from the mys terious craft, but would give no In formation as to her name, character or destination. Four strange men, who looked like Cubans, superintended the embarkation of the boats and sailed away with the steamer after the work was completed. A renort is circulated here that the same steamship lay off the Cape during the night, where arms and ammunition were taken on board from a schooner, whose mysterious movements attract ed the attention of the life saving crew. It is further repovted that the large yawls are to be loaded with these war like stores and manned by daring crews, and will be dropped on the coast of Cuba as the vessel steams through Mona passage. In this way they hope to run the blockade and communicate with the Cuban insurgent army. The vessel appparently came down the Delaware river from Philadelphia, Cape May, N. J., Dec. 1. The steam ship Horsa (Danish), whose captain and first and second mates were recent ly arrested and held In ball for the charge of alleged filibustering, sailed from Philadelphia yesterday afternoon and could easily have been off the Dela ware Capes at the tlra of the approach of the vessel to the ocean pier at Cape May. It Is thought by many here that tu vessel w the Horsa, O. P. Mstehlsr Misting. Bhamokln, Pa., Dee. l.-O. P. Mutchter. One of the wealthiest and most Influential residents of Bhamokln township, disap peared mysteriously yesterday. His fami ly Is greatly alarmed, as foul play- -Is fcartd. He was married om fW ago. .

BULLIED THE SULTAN Sir I'billp Currle Thought to Have Disturbed Action of the Towers. GERMANY STILL HESITATES The Kaiser Regards tho Naval Demon stration at the Straits of Dardanelles s Inopportune-Germany Doesn't Favor the Partition of Turkey. Berlin, Dec. 1. Without aiming at or In the slightest degree desiring to re buff the policy of the British govern ment to exert urgent pressure upon the sultan of Turkey, the diplomatic action of Germany In Constantinople has given Lord Salisbury a decided check. The reluctance of the sultan to permit each power to send a second dispatch boat through the straits of the Dardanelles has been fortified by the receipt of communications by the sultan which passed through the hands of the Ger man ambassador at Constantinople In timating that the kaiser regarded a naval demonstration in the Levant or an Increase of the number of guard boats at Constantinople as Inopportune. The Cologne Gazette in its Issue of last evening stated upon authority that the governments at Rome and Vienna were In complete accord with the Berlin government in its Turkish policy. The Berlin government from the first has held that extreme measures would be inopportune and has steadfastly ad hered to its refusal to lend Germany's strength to the carrying out of any pol icy designed, to break up the Ottoman empire. Currle Makes Threats. If the concert of the powers has been disturbed it is due to the action of Sir Pnilip Currle, tho British ambassador at Constantinople, who endeavored to commit the German and the other am bassadors to the adoption of extreme measures against the sultan. Accord ing to a report which is credited in official circles here Sir Phlllo Currle took it upon himself to bully the sultan with a threat that the combined fleets of the powers would force a passage through the Dardanelles If the de mands of the powers for permits ad mitting additional dispatch boats were not granted. Despite the obvious differences among the powers as to a plan of ac tion in Turkey, the German official press have been Instructed to keep up the fiction that the concert of the Pow ers is unimpaired. The wild schemes for the partition of Turkey which have been so widely and persisltently discussed In the Eng lish press have made a most unfavor able Impression here. A Turkish Version. Washington, Dec. 1. The Turkish legation received from the Sublime Porte the following telegram under to day's date: ; "The Armenlnn rioters Df Zlle At Slvas having closed their shops and fired on the Mussulmans killing on of them, an affray occurred during which four Mussulmans of whom two were soldiers, and five Armenians were killed. The necessary measures werv taken for the restoration of order. "The Armenian revolutionists at tacked the District of Endetin, burned the Palace of the governor and plund ered the neighboring Mussulman vil lages. Troops Were sent out for the repression of these disorders." Starvation Before Them. London, Dec. 1. The representative at Constantinople of the I'nlted Press telegraphing under yesterday's dnte, pictures a pitiable condition of affairs at Harpoot, where the American mis sion buildings were burtied at the time of the recent massacre there. Advices from Hnrpoot show that there Is great danger of hundreds of the poorer class es of Armenians starving to death. The people are now In a condition of apathy, and many of them, It Is be lieved, would welcome death at the hands of their enemies rather than to await the slow process of starvation. Some, however, who have a little money of their own or who have been secretly assisted by comparatively well to do compatriots, are fleeing to small places In the Interior, where they hope to bet ter their miserable condition. Those Armenians who have fled to Constantinople, thinking that in the capital they would be more or less under the protection of the representa tive of the various powers, have found their hopes dashed to the ground. Per haps If they were allowed to remnln, they might find the protection they seek, at any rate. It Is pretty certnln that they would be safe from cold blooded massacre, but the government In the case of the refugees is enforcing the principle of Berfdom that every subject Is bound to the soli and every day large numbers of Armenians are arrested. At night they are shipped In batches to the places where they were born, with the warning that It will be btter for them to remain there. I.neh Nannoeh Fired t pon. London, Dec. 1. The Dally News will tomorrow publish a despatch from Odessa giving an Interview with Cap tain Noble, of the British steamer Loch Rannoch from Lelth Nov. 1 for Odessa, which arrived a few days ago at Chanak, at the entrance of the Dardan nelles a few minutes after sun down. Captain Noble observed that the shore on either side of the straits was lined with troops under canvas, and that can non were placed at close stages along tne banks. Two blank shots were fired, one from each shore, at the Loch Ran noch. The captain did not heave his vessel to, thinking that the shots were part of some military manoeuvre. Soon three shells were fired at the steamer. The first shell dropper under the bow of the steamer, the second fell eastern and the third whizzed across the bridge a few feet from the captain's bead. Captain Noble Instantly reversed the steamer's engines. He was astonished and thought that war had been de clared between England and Turkey. Hitherto the Turkish authorities have always allowed a time margin for ves sels arriving In the straits after sun down. The head of the Dardannelles is covered with torpedoes. . Compromise Reached. London, Dec. 1. The Telegraph will tomorrow will publish a -dispatch from Vienna saying It is reported that compromise has been reached between the foreign representatives at Constan tinople and the Sultan regarding the guardshlp question. The Sultan, It Is said, will grant the Firmans neces sary for the entry of the guardshlp Into the Bosphorus on condition that the Powers will not use them unless the lives of Christians are seriously en dangered. PROTECTING AMERICANS, Mr, Olaey Says Everything i Being Dons ; 5" . toIsnrs1sjelr-fety. Kalamasoo, Mich., Dec. 1. Chairman James W. Osborne of the mass meet ing held here recently on the Armenian question has received the following re ply from Secretary of Bute Olney to the resolutions which were forwarded to him!

The New York and Philadelphia Express Crashes Into e Freight Train-Engineer and Fireman Are Killed. Syracuse, N. T., Dec. 2. The New York and Philadelphia express on the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western railroad, which leaves Syracuse at 10.10 p. in., was wrecked one-half mile north of Preble Station, twenty-six miles south of this city, at l20 a. m. The train, which consisted of one baggage car, one mall car, two day coaches and a sleeper, was running at the rate of fifty miles an hour when the wrecK occurred. The siding at Preble had been opened to allow a freight train to get out of the way of the express, and crashed into the freight cars on the Riding, completely telescoping tnree of them. The engine and tender of the express were completely demolished, and the engineer, George oYung, of Syracuse, was Instantly killed: Web ster Root, of Syracuse, the fireman, was taken from beneath the wreck of the engine and died soon afterward. At least a dozon passengers were badly In jured. No sooner had the wreck occurred than the baggage car. which was re duced to kindling wood In the collision, caught tire from the engine. The panic stricken passengers had hardly time to get from the cars before the whole train was in a blaze. The scene of the wreck Is half a mile from any farm house, and the passengers had to fall back on their own resources to assist themselves and their Injured compan ions. There were about fifty passen gers on the train. Including the mem bers of "The Bowery Girl" theatrical company. The Train In Flames. At 1.30 the whole train Is In flames. A wrecking train, with physicians on board, hns been sent out from Syra cuse. It is not certain that the engi neer and fireman are the only ones killed. ' It develops that the wrecking of the train was undoubtedly medltnted. and not due to carelessness. In leaving open the swlth. The switch was found locked open after the wreck occurred. It is Impossible to get fulled particulars this morning. RAILWAY STATISTICS. Interesting Figures Furnished by Major Isaac Brown. Harrlsburg, Pa., Dec. 1. Major Isnac Brown, the superlntvndent of tho rail way bureau of the department of In ternal nffalrs. has finished the compli cation of statistics for 1S95. The sec tion covering the accidents on steam railways is interesting. It shows a total of 29 killed and (!12 Injured; 417 employes killed and H..1-I6 Injured; 1.107 other persons killed and 1,G4! injured, a grand total of 1.583 killed and 10.607 injured. The grade crossing and sui cide are mentioned as two of the causes of fatalities among those classified ns "other persons" to distinguish them from passengers and employes. The statistics for the year show thnt to every 432 employes there was one killed and to every 2:1 one was injured. Amonir nnssengers one was killed out of 4,325,"1S carried, and one injured In every 204.1177 carried. The Philadelphia nnd Reading com pany carried the greatest number of passengers for each one killed, nnd the Pennsylvania was second. The Lehigh Valley is third in the list In the way of a favorable exhibit for passengers rarrled without injury. The aggregate figures og the nine lending comoanies operat ing In the state show that-4,275,149 pas sengers were carried to one killed, and 147.419 carried to one Injured. Of the employes there hns been but one killed for 301 employed and seventeen In jured. A comparison for thp Inst five years shows clearly the results of the business depression In number of pas sengers carried and railroad men dis charged, the number drormed from the rolls In 1894 being about 94,000. TRANCE FOLLOWS TURKEY. Peculiar F.ffcct of a Thanksgiving Dinner on Miss Jessie Scrmnur. New York. Dec. 1. Miss Jessie Spv mour, of Elizabeth, N. J., who fell asleep after dining at Mrs. Mlley's house, at 1741 Sedgwick avenue, this city.

Dr. Ferguson, of Hlghbrldge, who has been attending the patient at first thought that she was suffering: from cerebral meningitis, but abandoned this heory and now accounts for her un conscious condition by saying it was due to nervous prostration.

REED TO BEjaE SPEAKER He is Nominated by Acclamation at the Republican Caucus. NAME PRESENTED BY MR. GROW The Man from Maine Receives the Unani mous Choice for Speaker of the House of Representatives Other Offi cersSelected at tho Caucus. Washington, Dec. 1. The scene last night around the chamber of the house of representatives, where the Republi can caucus was held, was an animated one. A early as, 7 o'clock all the ap proaches leading to the house were filled with crowds of people, and a large number of representatives were on floor a full hour before the caucus met The caucus settled down to work promptly at 8 o'clock, with Mr. Hooker, of New York, the secretary of the cau cus, In the chulr. The lirst test of the relative strength of the McDowell tick-r et and its opponents was shown In the vote on the election of chairman of the caucus. William A. Stone, of Pennsyl vania, who had been the principal manager for McDowell and those as sociated with him, nominated the vet eran Ohiolan, General Charles H. Oros venor, while Mr. Dolllver, of Iowa, who represented the Henderson forces, pro posed the name of Mr. Henderson, of Iowa. At the conclusion of the roll call the vote stood 155 for (Irosvenor to 73 ior Henderson. This showed the pres ence of 22S members, and it disclosed the fact thnt the McDowell forces had not overrated their strength. Mr. Hopkins, of Illinois, placed Mr. Hills, of Oregon, In nomination for sec retary of the caucus for the Fifty fourth congress. Mr. Mercer, of Ne braska, nominated Mr. Hooker, of New York. Mr. Kills was elected by a vote of 139 to 77. On motion of Mr. Grow, of Pennsylvania, Thomas B. Reed, of Maine, was nomlnutcd for speaker by acclamation. On motion of Mr. Payne, of New York, a committee of three was appointed to conduct Mr. Reed to the hail. The committee consisted of Mr. Payne, Galtislia A. Grow, of Pennsyl vania, and Mr. Cannon, of Illinois. Mr. Reed, on entering the hall, was louillv applauded. Taking: a position In the arena before the presiding officer's desk, and speaking in an easy, conversational tone, he said: .Mr. Reel's Speech. Mr. Chairman and Oenilemen: For the honor which you have conferred upon nn; I lender you my sincere thiinks. lam .how ever, not in the least liable to eoiifounJ with my own personality this trllmie of your klndnvm. 1 hud only the ttood for tune to be so placed that I represented as well as I was able the patriotic sete of a great parly, und it Is to that putiiotlc sense of our purty that you tender the tribute of your matured as you did your temporary approval. History will accord us praise for what we did In the Klfty-tlrst congress, and it may accord us its praise In this for whtit we do not do. We have tinforturate-ly a dlvlileil govern ment, which usually leuds to small results. Hut there are times when rest Is us health giving us exercise. We must not forget that our tlrst and greatest duty is to do all we can to restore confidence to buslnefji, anil that we must avoid all business legis lation except In the direction of Improving business. Rather than run risks we can afford to wait until well-matured plans give us nssurances of permanent hem lit. Crude and hasty legislation Is above all things to be shunned. Could we cause our Ininunse popular majority to overflow Into other branches of the government and could we have full control we would create, not a perfect world perhaps, hut a world rather more tit to live in than we have lately had. IOven ns things are I do not for a mo ment doubt thnt our patriotic Instincts will lead us to raak every sacrifice, except of principle, to rescue our country from Its temporary disaster. Not only have we b'.-en elected by the overwhelming vote of the people as their Hcrvnn-ts, Out as a house of representatives, of which we nre the majority. The right to initiate taxation of the people Is by the constitution placed In our hands as a sacred 'trusit, which we have no rirht to surrender and which all parties, however they differ on other things, will assuredly maintain. That we shall be ready at nil times to furnish ade quate revenues for the government ac cording to our sense of public duly no man cun doubt. This Is the great nation of this hemi sphere, n r, 1 while we have no desire to In terfere with oiher nations, we shall main tain our position here with firmness an.l self-respect, nnd at the same time with careful consideration of facts nnd that conservatism of action which shall leave no bail question to trouble our future. In this I trust the whole government In all Its branches will bo in necord with each other and with the people. Other Officers Selected. After Mr. Reed's departure from the hall the work of placing the candidate for clerk in nomination began. Mr. Dalzell, of Pennsylvania, presented the name of Alexander McDowell, of Penn sylvania, and Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, performed a similar service for his late colleague, Mr. Henderson, of thnt state. The roll was called and Mr. McDowell was elected by a vote of lfi4 to 74. Nominations for sergennt-at-arms were next In order. Mr. Batholdt, of Missouri, presented the name of lien Jamin P. Russell, of that state. Mr. Kvans. of Kentucky, placed In nomina tion Edward A. Parker, also of Ken tucky. In a short speech he asked his election as a recognition of the Southern Republicans. Mr. Itussell was elected by a vote of 1G7 to 70. William J. Olenn. of New York, was nominated for doorkeeper over Mr. Lin ney. of North Carolina, by a vote of 1(18 to 64.
