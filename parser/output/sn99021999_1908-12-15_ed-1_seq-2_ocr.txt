A plow costs ti Mexican money In our markats, a single olsk pluw costs $100 and even more a binder cannot be bouphl for less than 500, a thresher with traction engine ccsts at least W.0"0, and a steam plow has cost aa much aa $3u,lw0. You will therefore un derstand that the want of agricultural Im plement factories In the eountry puts these desirable utensils beyond the reaeh of the mall farmer and renders It difficult for him to entirely set aside the antiquated Implements, wltlch, unfortunately, are -still Indispensably lAjcessary to the poor man, and, in view of their low. price, attract the Itentlrn of some rich men. - In treating of the agricultural wealth of Mexico country, which forma - the subject of this paper, I think ll is desirable t begin with certain historical antecedai.ts of Its national life. During the colonial period the Mexican territory was governed by legislatures anil laws whose foundations rested on conquest; that is to say, that they still felt the evil effects of the force of arms by which the country had been acquired. It was for this reason that agri culture, which only prospers when a true and well meditated conception of political economy haa been formed, was reUgated to certain places, and did not stand for that which pertains to ft amongst nations that are considered civilized. In forming part of these nations, Mexico has folhmed toe practice advised by science. Nevertheless we must not forget ' that from the primitive Roman piow to tne wooden stick and other agricultural imple ments of ancient times, these antiquated methods were perpetuated In new opaln, and with them, the lamentable conse quences to which they gave rise, witn re spect tj ail advancements in the cultivation of the sol). The soil wap - unquestionably fertile; the crops were scarce, and thougn the products were necessary, tne methods of acquiring ne same were abandoned, and If all this appeared SitUfaclu. y, the men of those days did not take thought of tho serious evils of the methods they followed, and by which they transmitted from one generation to another m.-thods that were In every way vicious and btenind the age. Evolution of PoltlcaJ Ideas. Senor Ooroipe then cited the evolution of political Idea as an element of progress In the gaining of national independence. Then on to the intameclne struggles which made the peasant warlike he found the cause that produced, the effect of leaving agriculture without labor and to this evil, though transitory, he. added the general prostration of the young republic. Against unfavorable conditions Mexico had to pro ceed with agricultural development and it finally emancipated itself from these bonds by the importation of foreign labor. The speaker added: Everything new which implies ' an ad vance In the methods for woraLng the soil, have gradually come to find an open door among us, from the methods of distribut ing and utilising the .energies of the laborer, of developing his intelligence, of utilising his talents and remunerating his work, to the substitution of modern meiu. ods for the antiquated and obao.eie. Cuem istry, mercantile calculations app ted to tne management, and scientma observations are luday held to the indispensable parts of the educstion of the agriculturists. It Is not only foreign influence which has in troduced these improvements Into the re public; a good, nuinbvr.ot young and tal ented Mexicans are educating themselves to the complicated scientific stutiy of the soil, In coin. ectum with the biological de tails of the vegetable kingdom. - The agricultural school, which is ' at tended by a considerable group of students, in co-oprration with tiie experimental sta tions whlcn have bean established la de sirable regions of the country, in prepar ing the staff of professors.: who later on will communicate their know.edgv to our i annexe, me present generation or winch may now be said to be truly civilised. As fast as new and improved aiethoda are dis covered in other countries, -our . fa me is eagerly adopt them, so much so. that we have successfully carried OUl work of Irri gation by the employment of powerful pumpa. thus fertilising laada that wrx formerly considered barren; the subo!.'

Baalngcr, assistant general passen ger agent of the Union Pacific, who re turned Monday morning from Chicago, said that the Northwestern officials In Chicago were expecting over 200 from Chicago. Other delegations will come from St. Louis, Kansas City, St. Joseph, Minneapolis, Mil waukee and St. Paul. The St. Louis grain dealers expect to make quite a junketing trip of their visit to the exposition. They will stop In St. Joseph on the way to Omaha, spend, Tues. day in Omaha, Wednesday In Lincoln, Wednesday evening In Omaha and Thurs day in Kansas City, thus visiting the southern Missouri valley renters all on onn trip. The St. Louis delegation will occupy special cars on the Burlington. , WYOMING SIAKES A FINE! SHOW Cereals, Grasses nnd Potatoes Ssrpacs Moat AH States. Comparisons are odious and discrimina tions dangerous, but it may be stated as a fact that many Corn show visitors think 'the display of grains and grasses by the i state of Wyoming la the best official ex hibit at the exposition. There are potatoes there, too, as large as watermelons and stock beets also simply monstrous. Beside an excellent showing of wheat, oats and ( a'11'" ... V. .

One table states that according to the United States census of 1900 Wyoming's acreage production of potatoes was 200, Ne braska's seventy-three, Iowa's seventy. Jflve, Missouri's eighty-two and Kansas eighty-three bushels. A display of oats In the Wyoming section is said to be the Room, 3rd U finest showing outside of the English grain of the kind.

The young women wore mortar boards made of corn and academlo gowns embroidered with more corn. The whole get-up. tout en semble, or something of that sort, was ef fective In the extreme. Two men, dressed as heralds, alo In costumes made of corn, lent a further, picturesque note to the party, every member of which was bub bling over with genuine Red Oak enthus iasm.

TuUSlY dM LABOR (Continued from first Page.) ress. For this reason, the federation pro poses to do everything In its power to pro mote the use of the trade agreement in a constantly widening fleM." Mitchell on Trade Agreements. John Mitchell, fo,mtr president of the United Mine Workers of America, spoke as chairman of the trade agreement de partment. He said in part: It is a waste of time to deplore the passing of the individual relationship be tween employer and workman which ex isted under the .old order of production. The organizat.on of labor and tne combination of capital is the natural and logical se quence of cruel, wasteful and ruinous com petition. "The proposition,, stated candidly and without equivocation, Is: 8hall these ' two powerful forces, each indispensible to the other, wage contiguous- and uestructlve warfare, or shall they . recognise each other's existence and adopt measures which will Insure 'on an equitable bat.ls Industrial peace and, commercial prosperity, at tha same time affording to the general publics protection and Insurance against the dis comforts, the cost and the Inconvenience which accompany Industrial strife. Trade agreement Is an unmistakable recognition of the Interdependence of labot and capital; It is the concrete expression of co-operative .effort between these two dominant factors in our industrial life. It Is an acknowledgement of the rights and obligations of the workmen and the rights and obligations of the employer; its formulation gives the workman a knowl edge of the employer's business and It gives the employer a knowledge of the I workman's needs and wants, which it is i essential that each should have, in fairly : determining all questions of wages and conditions el employment. Altogether, tha conference which, leads up to the consum mation of a trade agreement opens the way for dlssioatine manv falBe lmm-es- Blon. ami 'cleastfgr-trp' m'lsundenstandlngs which of . themselves . frequently lead to serious consequences. The trade agreement Is In substance and effect the antithesis of the strike and the lockout. It will not, of course, prevent all strikes or obviate all lockouts, but in the past it has reduced and In the future It will to a greater extont reduce the num ber of industrial . disputes and minimize their Intensity. James O'CVmnell Sneaks. James O Connell, president of the Inter national Association of Machinists, in dis cussing "Trade Agreements'' said re osnl tlon of the union had become the root prin ciple of every trade union. "It is short-sighted policy, illogical an4 unfair," he said, "when capital denies to labor the rights that It ungrudgingly con- codes to every other factor In Its employ ment. 'The International Association of aMchln- Ists has been particularly successful in mak'ng r-gr ements with rallr ads and o.her corporations. It has been fund that these agreements have- been helpful in many ways, but principally In creatii g a friendly feeling and a mutual respect between the two parties to the agreemu.it, working con ditions have been Improved wonderfully, while an esprit de corps has been developvd which has done mich to create splendid efficiency and excellency of service. "I look forward with pleasure to the day when employers will, without any hesita tion or fear of results, contract by agieu ment for their labor 'with the same spirit of fairness and justice as their other con tracts are now made.1 This, in my opl Ion, will do more to prevent str kes and lock outs, boycotting and blacklisting than any other force at our cammond today." Printers' Contracts Ilnve Good Effect. ! James M. Lynch; s cak'ng cm "The Trade Agreement in. the Interna. lnnal Typograph ical Union," said the principle had been In effect since 1876. In 1898, he said, the writ ten agreement became fashionable instead of the verbal kind, the growth belrg shown by the returns of the last year during which 4.177 contracts were approved. Mr. Lynch next spoke of the revolution that his branch of the printing trade un derwent from 1890 to 19 0 through the creat ing of new conditions in tho composing rooms as a result of the introduction of the typesetting machines. This with the quits general adoption of the written trade agreement made it neces sary to prov.de for some method of deter mining disputes that might arise. Sund.ng commltues, represent ng emp oyer r.nd em ployed were provided for and where they coultf not settle disputes such questions were referred to a board of arbitration. 'To my mind," ha said, "there Is no question of the great value of the trade agreement In establishing stable cond t urn In any industry. I know that It has ac complished this in qur branch of the print ing Industry, and our example In support ing and formulating such agree , etjts has been followed by the other four Interna tional unions In the prlnt.ng Industry."

SPECIAL MESSAGE OF PRESIDENT Executive Sends Record of Investiga tion and Suggests Men Be Allowed to Re-enlist Under Certain. Conditions. WASHINGTON, Dec. 14.-Senator For aker today introduced an amendment to the bill providing for the re-enlistment of the negro troops discharged without honor because of alleged participation In the af fray at Brownsville, Tex., and addressed the senate concerning the amendment. He proposes In his new measure to establish a tribunal, consisting of retired army officers, naming these officers in the bill, before whom evidence may be submitted aa to the guilt of defendenta and before whom the defendants themselves might appear to answer to charges. Tha measure la so drawn as practically to take out of the hands of the executive, and give to a tribunal appointed by congress, full author ity to consider- the Brownsville question, and by its findings provide for the re-en-llstment of the discharged negroes. In addressing the senate Mr. Foraker said it was an elementary proposition in American law that the accused may have an opportunity to confront the accuser, and to appear in person and answer evldenco with evidence. He said that he had not ex pected It would b!e necessary to enter upon a new lnvestgation of the Brownsville question, but that during the summer let ters .had been coming .to him fromhe discharged negro - soldiers, declaring that detectives were constantly engaging them in conversation. "These men,"' said Senator Foraker, "are not secret service detectives, of course, fo they would have no right un der the law to engage In such service." Says Detectives Are Active. Continuing, the senator spoke of the ac tivities of the detectives as outlined by his correspondents, saying that In many cases they went so far as to take up their dwell ing with the discharged soldiers for the purpose of securing the confidence and spying upon their movements. The senator read extracts from the letters, a . large batch of which he had In his hands as he spoke. One of the soldiers wrote to Senator Foraker that he was questioned by a de tective in respect to any letters he might have received from the senator. "There seems to be a good deal of interest about my correspondence." added Mr. Foraker. Upon the conclusion of Mr: Foraker's remarks Mr. Culberson moved that the president's message on the Brownsville af fair be read, and Vice President Fairbanks directed that that be done, all the senators present remaining In their seats and listen ing attentively. The clerk then read all of the state ments and other evidence submitted to the War department, for which the president's message was merely a letter of transmit tal. This In contrary to the usual custom. Ordinarily the general reports are sent to the proper committee without the formality of reading. In view of the fact that the report contains what purports to be a par tial confesslnn of giillt by one of the dis charged negro sr Idlers, much Interest was shown In the reading. Message ef the President. "To the Senate: I Incloee herewith a letter from the sccrelary of war transmu ting a report of the Investigation made by Mr., Herbert J. Browne, employed by the department In conjunction with Capt in W. G. Baldwin to Investigate as far as possible what happened at Brownsville on August 13 and 14, 1Kj6. The report and doc uments contain some Information of great value and sumo statements that are ob viously worthless, but I submit them In their entirety. "This report enables us to fix with tol erable def.nlteness at least some of the criminals who tool; the lead In the mur derous shooting of prlvste cl, liens at Brownsville. It estublls es clearly .he fact that the colored soldiers did the shooting, but upon this point further record was un necessary, as the fact that the colored sol diers did the shooting has already boon established beyond all possibility of doubt. The Investigation lias i:ot gne far enough to enable us to determine all the fuels, and we will proceed with It, but it has guno tar enough to de.e.mtne with su.f cle.it ac curacy certain tac.s of enough importance to make it advisable that I place the report before yo-i. It appears that jilmost all the members of Company B must have been actively concerned In the shooting, either to tho extent ot being participants or to the extent of virtually encouraging those who were participants. , "As to Compan.es C and D, there can be no question that practically every man in 1 them must have had knowledge that the shooting was done by some of tte soldiers of B troop, and possibly by one or two others In one of the other troops. This concealment was itself a grave offense, which was greatly aggravated by their tesUylng before the senate committee that they were ignorant of what they must have known.. Nevertheless, it Is to bo said In partial extenuation that they were prob ably cowed by threats, made by the more desperate of the men who had actually been engaged In the shooting, as to what would happen to any man who failed to pro tect the wrongdoers. Moreover, there ars circumstances tending to show that these misguided men were enooursgod by outsid ers to persist In their course of conceal ment and denial. "I feel, therefore, that the guilt of the Beaulifol Poem In the Sunday Bee? Here is the last verse: "When It was Christmas and jtood Mr. Jones Draped In white whiskers stood close to the Tree, Willie eicltedly felt In his bones. ' -.
