More public laud was sold in North Dakota this year than in the other states of the union altogether, $4,757,979 worth of land being sold throughout the country. Of this total, North Dakota contributed $870,280. The reclamation fund will consequently be increased to about $26,000,000. Considering the large tracts of the public domain withdrawn from entry recently on account of irrigation, the showing is regarded as good. The Annual Report of the Land •Office Department shows that dur ing the year $16,079,075 acres of public land and 77,746 acres of In dian lands were disposed, of, the total exceeding that for 1904 by •650,000 acres, of public lands dis posed of, 12,$95,571 acres were en-, tered under the homestead laws, 696,677 under the timber and stone law, 711,124 under the desert land .lawand 285,757 acres of swampland patented. The total receipts for the year, including those from the sale of Indian lands, were $7,017,911. Under the law, the net proceeds of the sale of public lands are turned into the treasury for the. benefit of the irrigation reclamation fund and the total amount for the year to be so disposed of is approximately $4,756,079, of which North Dakota receives $870,790, and Montana $350,031. "When Garfield was inaugurated president of the United States on the 4th of March, 1881, after he had taken the oath of office in"the pres ence of many thousands of people, he kissed the hqly bible and then turns and kisses his aged mother and his wife. No artist can do justice to that event. He knew how proud his mother was to see him installed in the highest office in the gift of the American people, and in that hour of exaltation, his heart turned to his mother. How different this beautiful example left by our martyred president to that of the average "Ybung American" who never fails to speak of his mother «s "the old woman."—Exchange. 

NORTH DAKOTA LEADS. The census bureau has just is sued a bulletin on the illiteracy of native white people between the •ages of ten and fourteen years, and it is shown that in North Dakota in 1900 there were 7.6 out of every thousand who could not read or write, while in Maine the number run up to 13.6 Texas, 61 Georgia, 104 South Carolina, 148 North Oarolin, 166 and New Mexico, 17o. In 1890, the number in North Da kota was 28.2 against 7.6 in 1900. This is a very goed: decrease, show ing that about three-fotirths of the illiteracy had been obliterated in -ten years. Every state in the union 8hows some decrease, but the pro portion in North Dakota is about as large as any. This is a high tribute to the educational system •of this state—Bismarck Tribune.

He took back with, him several pieces of silver, which were-at one time $30. but since the fire are only worth about $15, as Uncle Stvm's half was burned off. Mrs. John P. Lunden, who lived with her sons on a farm twenty three miles northwest of Garrison, died Monday afternoon of heart failure. Owing to the raging bliz zard, it was impossible to secure medical aid. The decedent had re sided in this section only three months, coming here from Minne sota. The Lunden brothers brought the sad news to town, reaching here Wednesday night. No coffin could be secured in Garrison, and on ac account of the telegraph, telephone and train service being out of com mission, it was necessary for them to hire a man to start to Underwood Thursday morning to secure bne. It is expected now that burial will take place some time Saturday. McLean Co. Independent. Miss Bray, living about fourteen miles from here, is reported very sick with pneumonia. Dr. R.

He left the Smith Norton ranch about noon, and got lost shortly after he left, and kept on driving until he found a claim shanty, where he stayed all night. He drove to Garrison the next day, somewhat froze but not much worse for his experience. Twenty-five members have signed already to organize a lodge of Eagles here, and as soon as lodge rooms can be secured, Judge Murray, of Minot, state organizer, together with some of the members of the Minot lodge, will come and organ ize the lodge here.

WILTON NEWS. THE CENTER REPUBLICAN. Delbert Cleveland lost a yearling colt Wednesday afternoon by what is charitably supposed to be a mis directed shot, although it it is hinted that witnesses may develop to prove that it was done with mal icious intent. Wm. Smith of Sanger and Harvey Bagley, of Hensler, were in town Sunday religioning according to their own notions, as becomes good American citizens. Smith Bros. & Bagley have finished threshing. They destrawed something like 75,000 bushels of grain in a run of fifty-three days. Geo. Baye can't understand why blacksmiths are considered indis pensable, as he does his own horse shoeing. He has put in his bid for the Washburn mail line for the next four years but is not worrying over the result, as in the event of failure, farming is good enough for him. Mr. Baye has been identified with frontier life for many a, long year and has a long list of acquaint ances, ranging from President The odore Roosevelt to your humble servant. The blizzard knocked Jno. Light into the middle of next week. He showed up Wednesday when he was booked to appear Sunday. While away, he went hunting and bagged two fine specimens of the genus deer, whose weight will aggregate 4001bs. The fact that the hind-, quarters of one of the animals was missing will remove all suspicion that the venison was obtained at a butcher shop. John seems to think such evidence conclusive, that the animals fell before the powreps of his rifle without an affidavit.

The recent arrest and trial of a number of Nebraska stockmen on the charge of fencing and using for grazing purposes certain public lands in that state without the con sent of the government, may result in more stringent restrictions being issued by the Interior Department and may end in curtailing the priv ileges heretofore given to stockmen. Just how far the department may extend its edict or wheather it will adopt any measure towards the abridgement of the privileges hith erto generously extended, remains to be seen.. However, this question is being so generally agitated that it may cause considerable uneasi ness on the, part pf stockmen and materially interfere with their plans by reason of the uncertainty as to what course the government may pursue. The Pioneer Press, of St. Paul, which is usually conservative on all public questions, in a recent edito rial under the caption of "The Cat tle Range Incubus" has the follow ing to say:— "Almost every week brings some fresh proof that the- range cattle business of the west is an incubus on the growth of the country, and that, so far from being afforded any further protection or encourage ment from the government it should be wiped out at the earliest practi cable moment. The land occupied by the cattle men is nearly all a portion of the public domain. Where private ti tle has been secured, it will nearly always be found to have been se cured by some fraud upon or per version of the land laws. But in numerous instances all the rights of private ownership are assumed and exercised without a shadow of title The laws prohibiting the fencing in of public lands is ruthlessly vie lated. Settlers seeking to establish homes under the protection of na tional law, are driven off, their property destroyed, and the process of courts made a laughing stock. For in the range country, the cat tleman is king, and everybody bows to his wishes. Juries will not con vict the -law breakers, or if convic tions are secured, the penalties as sessed are nominal. In a recent series of suits brought by the Interior Department against cattlemen in Nebraska who had il legally fenced in 212,000 acres of public land for their own private use, the district court declared the crime a mere statutory offense and assessed their punishment at a fine of $300 and six hours' confine ment, which were spent convivially in the custody of the United States marshal. If range lands had no present market value, if no one else wanted to use them and no damage was done by the grazing of cattle, there would still remain the fact that public property was being used by cattlemen to tneir own large prof with no compensation to the peof at large. But every day is demon strating that, under the irrigation or the modern methods of dry farm ing, any land which is good enough for grazing is good enough for ag riculture. Divided into small farms the "range" will support several times as many cattle as under the present system. Under the latter, too, immense damage is done, as is witnessed on thousands of acres where the grass has been practic ally killed by over-grazing. Land, the occupancy of which is practi cally then from the government, is not apt to receive the care of a husbandman from the thief. There would be no wrong done in an outright prohibition of cattle grazing on the public lands, fenced or unfencedi The cattlemen would pimply sell their stock, get their money and "quit," or they would resort to legitimate stock-farming on land which they have the privil ege of acquiring on the same terms as other citizens. The outcome would be more and better beef pro duced by more humane methods, as well as the removal of one of the greatest obstacle to the develop ment of the west."—Mandan Pio neer, There are about 'steen candida tes at present in the field for the forward office of sheriff—and the east end of the county to be. heard from. *4 uVti t$k iM ^3\K"^t^&*r
