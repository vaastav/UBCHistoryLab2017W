First 6tages of tlio Strike Portland. Dec. 17. The street car strike which has partially tied up traffic since late Saturday evening Is still unsettled although no violence or disorder has been shown. ' A lew of the motormen and conduc tors remain firm In their alleglenoe to the company and refuse to go out. With these the strikers have argued lncc-rwuntly since the beginning of the strike on Saturday evening. During Runduy a few cars were operated. llauy.df the strikers spent the. entire day at the car barns pleading with the men who still remained faithful to the company, to leave the bam and Join hi the strike. The ttreet car men have been assur ed of the hearty support of the feder ated trades of Portland. This has giuen .the strikers a new hope for success. The Idle cars have been taken ta the barns and crowds of strikers and strike sympathizers throng the barns In the doing of missionary work among the men who are yet at work. It is admitted now that had not the crowd of spectator In the streets anlsted the few strikers on Saturday evening, the first attempt wou'd have resulted In a total failure. The street csit men had not sufficiently organis ed io Insure the strike und many of the oldest and most Influential men remained with the company. Both sides are confident of winning the strike and both hold out with sul Un illenre In hopes nf gaining strength from public sentiment.

Practice of Collecting Money From "Box Car Passengers-' Causes Many to Lose Their Job Over 100 "Boomer" Hrakrnicn Have Lot Their Jobs In the Past live Years for Similar Offense Efforts Being Mnctc to Stop the Practice. I.a Grande, Dec. 17. (Special.) Ten O. R. & N. freight brakemen were discharged here last evening for carrying hoboes on freight trains, collecting money therefor In violation of the rules of the road. This Is the first trainmen discharg ed here for this cause for almost two years. 'I hi men discharged are most ly nw mvii, or "boomers," as they are called In railroad circles. They do not work long In a place, but are constantly changing locutions, (and also their names) and make a regu lar prnctice of carrying men In freight ears wherever they work. Owing to the' large numbers of worklngmen traveling during the ac tive railroad building In the north west this year, the "hobo" "passenger business Is said to have been extreme ly profitable, brakemen collecting as much us $25 per trip from this source. It ! In strict violation of the rules if the road to permit any one to ride In cars or engines, and the vlolntlon Is doubly objectionable where money is collected by trainmen and officials arc determined to prevent the traffic if nosrlble. About 100 brakemen have been discharged on the La Grande division for this cnuse, In the past five yc.trs. SAFE nLOWERS CHASED AWAY. Three VnniecesHfiil Attempts to Blow (5(1 fo at Campbell.

Vi sit of Roosevelt to the Canal Zone Brings Out One of His Ablest and Most Entertaining Papers. The Work nt Panama Is Reviewed In Detail Health Conditions Are Ex plainedTechnical Details of Construction Are Given in a Most Enter tabling Manner Galleries and Both Houses Listen Intently. Wnshlngton, Dec. 17. The chief feature of the Besslon today was the reading of tho able message of Presl-. dent Roosevelt upon the Panama ca nal situation. This message Is the detailed report of the president's trip to Panama and goes Into every feat ure of the canal situation with a thor oughness and technical knowledge which Is remarkable for a man not ac tually engaged In the work of con struction. , The message was greeted with marked attention, the galleries being crowded and most of the members In their seats. After reviewing the tedious pro cesses by which It was finally deter mined by the United States to build the Panama canal, the president's message was In part as follows, on the chief topics: The wisdom of the canal manage ment has been shown In nothing more clearly than In the way In which the foundations of the work have been laid. To have yielded to the natural Impatience of Ill-informed outsiders and begun all kinds of experiments In work prior to a thorough sanitation of the isthmus, and to a fairly satis factory working out of the problem of getting and keeping a sufficient labor supply, would have been disastrous. The various preliminary measures had to be taken first; and these could not be taken so as to allow ns to be gin the real work of construction prior an January 1 of the present year. It then became necessary to have the type of the canal decided, and the only delay has been the necessary de lay until June 29, the date when the congress definitely and wisely settled that we should have an 85-foot level canal. Immediately after that the work be gan In hard earnest and has been con tlnued with Increasing vigor ever since; and It will continue so to prog ress In the future. When the contracts are let the conditions will be such as to Insure a constantly Increasing amount of performance; Health Showing Is Good. Just at present the' health showing on the Isthmus Is remarkably good so much better than In most sections of the United States that I do not be lieve that It can possibly continue at quite Its present average. Thus, early In the present year a band of several hundred Spaniards were brought to the Isthmus as laborers, and additions to their number have been made from time to time; yet since their arrival In February last but one of those Spaniards thus brought over to work on the canal has died of disease, and he of typhoid. Two others were killed, one in railroad accident, and one by a dyna mite explosion. There has been for the last six months a well-nigh steady decline In the death rate for the pop ulation of the zone, this being largely due to the decrease In deaths from pneumonia, which has been the most fatal disease on the isthmus. In October there were 99 deaths of every kind among the employes of the Isthmus. There were then on the rolls 5500 whites, seven-eighths of them being Americans. Of these whites but two died of disease, and ns it happened neither mnn wns an American. Of the 6000 white Amerlcnns, In cluding some .1200 women and chil dren, not a single death has occurred In the past three months, whereas In nn average city In the United States the numher of denths for a similar number of people In thnt time would have been about 30 from disease. This very remarknble showing can not of course, permanently obtain, but It certainly goes to prove thnt If good care Is taken the Isthmus Is not a par ticularly unhealthy place. In October, of the 19,000 negroes on the roll 86 died from disease; pneumonia being the most destructive disease, nnd mnlarlal fever,, coming second. The difficulty of exercising a thorough supervision over the col ored lnhorers Is of course greater than la the case among the whites, nnd they are nlso less competent to take core of themselves, which accounts for the fact that their death rate Is so much higher thnn thnt of the whites. In spite of the fact that they hnvo been used to similar climatic conditions. Even among the colored employes It will be seen that the death rate Is not high. Cnro of Employe. Next In Importance to the problem of sanitation, and Indeed now of equal Importance, is the problem of secur ing and caring for the mechanics, la borers, and other employes who ac tually do the work on the canal and the railroad. This great task has been under the t mm control of Jackson Smith, and on the whole has been well done. At pres ent there ore some 6000 white em ployes and some 19,000 colored em ployes on the Isthmus. I went over the different places where the differ ent kinds of employes were working; I think I saw representatives of every type of both at their work and In their homes; and I conversed with probably 100 of them all told, choosing them at random from every class and In cluding those who did not come to present certain grievances. I found those who did not come specifically to present grievances almost Invariably expressed far greater content and sat isfaction with the conditions than did those who called to make complaint. Nearly 5000 of the white employes had come from the United States. No man can see these young, vigorous men energetically doing their duty without a thrill of pride In them as Americans. They represent on the average a high class. Doubtless to congress the- wages paid them will seem high, but as a matter of fact the only general com1 plaint made to me upon the Isthmus wns that, owing to the peculiar Bur roundlngs, the cost of living, and the distance from home, the wages were really not as high as they should be In fact, almost every man I spoke to felt that he ought to be receiving more money a view, however, which the average man who stays at home In the United States probably likewise holds as regards himself. New Records in Excavating. As soon as the type of canal was decided this work began In good earnest. The rainy season will short ly be over and then there will be an Immense Increase In the amount taken out; but even during the last three months. In the rainy season, steady progress Is shown by the figures: In August, 212,000 cubic yards; In Sep tember, 291,000 cubic yarus, and In October, 325,000 cubic yards. In October new records were estab lished for the output of Individual shovels as well as for the tonnage haul of Individual locomotives. I hope to see the growth of a healthy spirit of emulation between the different shovel and locomotive "crews. Just such a spirit as has grown on out battleships between the different gun crews In matters of marksmanship. Passing through the cut the amount of new work can be seen at a glance. In one place the entire side of a hill had been taken out recently by 27 tons of -dynamite, which were ex ploded at one blast. At another place I was given a presidential salute of 21 charges of dynamite. On the top notch of the Culebra cut the prism Is now as wide as It will be; all told, the canal bed at this point has now been sunk about 200 feet below what It originally was. It will have to be sunk about 120 feet farther. Throughout the cut the drill ing, blasting, shoveling and hauling are going on with constantly increas ing energy, the huge shovels being pressed up, as If they were mountain howitzers, Into the most unlikely look ing places, where they eat their way Into the hillsides. Answers the Slnndercrs. Concluding his vigorous and thor ough report on the canal situation, the president says of the slanderous reports and articles which have been printed by various correspondents and publications: So much for honest criticism. There remains nn Immense amount of as reckless slander as has ever been published. Where the slanderers are of foreign origin I have no concern with them. Where they are Ameri cans. I feel for them the heartiest contempt and Indignation; because, In a spirit of wanton dishonesty and malice, they are trying to Interfere with, and hnmper the execution of. the greatest work of the kind ever attempted, nnd are seeking to bring to untight the efforts of their country men to put to the credit of America one of I lie giant feats of the iircs. Tile outrageous accusations nf these slanderers constitute a gross libel upon n body of public servants who, for trained Intelligence, expert ability. high character nnd devotion to duty, have never been excelled anywhere. There Is not a mnn among those di recting the work on the Isthmus who lias obtained his position on any other basis than merit alone, and not one who has used his position In any way for his own personal or pecuniary ad vantage.
