NO PROTECTION Is Needed for Prodnctif n of Steel Says Carnegie. Backs Up His Recent Statements in Magazine Article. HE PRAISES SCHWAB. Credits Him With Strides Made in Improving Metals. Becomes Witty in Talking of Judge Gary's Testmony. Washington, Dec. 21. That the steel industry of the United States had reached a point where it does not need protection, but can stand alone in com petition with the world was the fea ture of the testimony today of Andrew Carnegie before the house committee on ways and means, which is securing evidence designed to assist It in the preparation of a new tariff bill. Mr. Carnegie was subpoenaed as a witness and began his testimony early in the morning's session and will not, it Is ex pected conclude until late in the af ternoon. The laird of Skibo castle had primed himself for the ordeal of the rigid questioning which he was to un dergo and he kept the committee and the audience In constant laughter by his ready retorts and his wit. He would not deal in figures, claiming that the more that figures were used the more the subject would become befogged. Mr. Carnegie in the course of his an swers characterized Mr. Schwab as a genius and Mr. Gary as a most lovable man, but a very shrewd one. He ex pressed the opinion that wages would not be reduced if the tariff was lower ed or removed entirely. He was ut terly opposed to an income tax, believ ing as he said, with Mr. Gladstone, that such a tax produced a nation of liars. The Laird of Skibo castle testified in support of the statements that he made in his magazine article, declar ing that the fact3 show that the steel Industry needs no protection. As a witness Mr. Carnegie proved the most Interesting who has appeared before the committee, interspersing his testi mony with humorous and epigram matic remarks. Praising the genius of Charles M. Schwab, Mr. Carnegie suggested that congress should extend a vote of thanks to Mr. Schwab for his work in Improving the methods of steel mak ing in this country. "I never met his equal,", said Mr. Carnegie in speaking of Mr. Schwab, "and when we were partners we were a team." "That is very apparent," remarked Chairman Payne. Speaking of the testimony of Judge Gary before ihe committee. Mr. Car negie said: "1'ou should not place any real value on the testimony of interested parties. Judge Gary said that the United States Steel corporation could stand for reduction in the tariff on steel, but that the smaller steel manu facturers could not survive with low ered duties. That is like one of Aesop's fables. Judge Gary is like the monkey who desired the chestnuts, but wanted the cat to pull them out of the fire.' The crowded room frequently rang with peals of laughter at the quips of Mr. Carnegie, who seemed to be in splendid shape for the questions ask ed by Representatives Dalzell and Payne. 'At one point Mr. Payne lean ed over and whispered to Mr. Dalzell who sat at his right. "I wish the chairman would tell me what he said to Mr. Dalzell. I think I ought to know," Mr. Carnegie pro tested. There was a roar- of laughter throughout the room, but Mr. Payne made no reply. Leaning over with his hand to his ear and his head cocked to one side, in imitation of the attitude assumed by Mr. Payne, in whispering to Mr. Dalzell, Mr. Carnegie said: "I should say that your words were 'the jig is up." " Mr. Carnegie was not willing to deal in figures. "The more figures you get, the more you will be befogged. I do not judge by figures given by interested parties." he said at another point in his testimony. "I judge by results." The former steel magnate said that Judge Gary had issued an annual statement showing that the United States Steel corporation had made a profit of $158,000,000 which he said equalled a profit of $15.50 a ton on all stee! produced. Mr. Carnegie avoided direct replies to eiuetions as to whether the cost of producing steel at the present time as given by Judge Gary and Mr. Schwab was correct. "Mr. Schwab's estimate of the present cost is based on entirely different ideals than his estimate on the cost in 1S99," was all that Mr. Carnegie would say. Replying to a question from Mr. Cockran, Mr. Carnegie declared thai the removal of the duty on steel would not necessarily affect the prices, be cause Europe could not successfully compete with the American product. He also said that if the figures given by former witnesses were absolutely cor rect steel stock would be selling "below par. Mr. Carnegie spoke of the difficul ties he experienced with directors Ignorant of the steel business. "I gradually bought them out and got men like Schwab around me and we made the cheapest steel that has ever been made." "You've been out of steel some time." said Mr. Payne. "Can you tell us where we can get the figures on the present cost of manufacturing steel?" "I don't know whether you can get the figures." was his reply. "If a judge was interested in a case you would not respect his decision would you?" he asked, referring to the' steel manufacturers, who have appear ed before the committee. There was no reply to Mr. Carnegie's question. "Silence in the court room," he laughingly remarked. "It's too bad I have to submit to be cross examined and can't get a chance to cross ex amine these dignitaries." Iron Ores Beinjr Exhausted. Mr. Carnegie asserted that at the rate at which iron ores are being ex tracted, the supply would be exhausted in 40 years. He based his statement on the best expert opinion he could obtain he said. He also said that Eng land would be in the same condition in seven years. The testimony of Judge Gary was frequently referred to in the questions asked of Mr. Carnegie. Reference was made particularly to a statement that the duty on steel could be taken off as fast as the steel corporation is concerned, and Mr. Carnegie said this portion should be accepted by the committee. .An argument was pre cipitated by this statement between Messrs. Payne and Dalzell on one side. claiming that Judge Gary did not say the duty could be removed on all steel products, and Mr. Cockran on the other hand claiming that Judge Gary's testimony was to that effect. Could Stand Some Free Trade. "Judge Gary has summarized the facts for you," said Mr. Carnegie, " and I should depend on them. He has told you that they don't need the duty. If the cost of steel rails has in creased abroad as it has increased here you will find Judge Gary's statement quite true and that he could stand free trade." "Judge Gary had testified that the, price is as high abroad," said Chair man Paye. "Then does not that show that you have nothing to fear from free trade?" was the prompt re joinder. Mr. Carnegie was questioned at length regarding the cost of pro ducing steelj but the witness de clared that honest men easily could differ on that question. The steel business he said, was a business by itself, and the cost to one man was a very different thing from the cost to. another. "When a gentleman of Judge Gary's character." he said, "comes to you and tells you he does not know a tariff, you ought to believe him." He insisted in reply to questions by Mr. Bonygne that the railways were not paying too much for steel rails. The steel rail makers he thought were making a fair profit. "How about other steel products besides steel rails?" Mr. Boyngne in quired. "I have not a word to say," Mr. Carnegie replied. "That's out of my province." Is Gar' a "Sleek Article." Mr. Ford recited the testimony of Mr. Schwab and was interrupted by Mr. Carnegie with the remark that "He is a genius."

"Would you recommend an income tax to make up the deficit in the reve nues?" Mr. Fordney asked.

He said that he came before the commttiee because sum moned and that he gave his testimony because he thought it his duty as an American citizen. We Can Beat tlie World." "I did not volunteer it," he said. Pressed with questions from all sides Mr. Carnegie arose from his seat, and dramatically declared that "he was a protectionist." .

Pointing his finger at the committee and raising his voice to its highest pitch he declared that the steel industry was now in the position where it can say: "Take your protection. We are now men and we can beat the world in the manufacture of steel. "There is no reason for the tariff on steel," he again emphasized. "You should not coddle the industry with protection." A recess at this point was ordered, Mr. Cargenie inquiring if the com mittee was through with him. "No." came a chorus of voices. "This is cruel," remarked the steel magnate as he retired from the room. THE

Is the Three Cornered Fight in Buckeye State. Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Indiana in Doubt. Washington, Dec. 21. While the terms of 31 senators, more than one-third of the entire body, expire on March 4, next, 18 of the number already have been re elected or assured of re-election, either through successes in primary contests or pledges of a majority of the mem bership of the several state legislatures charged with the duty of electing sen ators before the beginning of the next congress. In addition to the vacancies occur ring by reason of a provision of the constitution there will be a vacancy in Pennsylvania when Mr. Knox will ac cept the portfolio of secretary of state. Scramble for Knox's Seat. There will be a general scramble be tween prominent Republicans of Penn sylvania for Mr. Knox's seat which will cause public interest equal to the in terest going on now in Ohio for the seat of Senator Foraker. and in Con- necticut for the seat of Senator Brandegee. That Mr. Root will be giv en the New York senatorshlp now held by Senator Piatt is conceded, and a contest is not expected. The Republican senators whose terms Senator Allison, Dillingham of Vermont Gallinger of New Hampshire, Heyburn of Idaho, Hopkins of Illinois, Penrose of Pennsylvania, Perkins of California, Smoot of Utah, and Stephenson of Wis consin. Democratic senators who will be returned are Clark of Arkansas, Clay of Georgia, Gore of Oklahoma, Johnson of Alabama, McEnery of Louisiana, Newlands of Nevada, Overman of North Carolina, Smith of Maryland and Stone i of Missouri. of the Dernocrat senators whose terms expire on March 4, Gary, South Carolina, will be succeeded by E.

In the latter state a Demo crat will be elected to succeed Hemen way, the legislature having been lost by the Republicans in the recent elec tion. The eyes of the country are on Ohio because of the candidacy of Charles P. Taft, brother of the president-elect for the seat of Foraker, one of the most vigorous and picturesque characters in the senate and one who has declined to abandon his plac? without a fight. The Ohio Situation. The relationship between Mr. Taft and the president-elect and the fact that the Cincinnati editor has been prominent in the councils of the Re publican party in Ohio for many years are powerful factors in the contest he is waging for the senatorial toga. Forces opposed to Taft's election in cluding as they do Foraker. Represent ative Burton who placed Mr. Taft in nomination for the presidency and who has been recognized as one of his prin cipal supporters, Harry M. Daughertv and former Speaker Keifer must be reckoned with, and especially if there should be a combination effected be tween the forces led by Senators For aker and Dick and the members tof the legislature friendly to Burton. With out such an alliance the indications arc that Mr. Taft would go into the fight in the lead, but astute politicians de clare they would not be surprised to see Foraker withdraw in lavor or Bar ton. At the present time the result must be conceded to be in doubt. The official announcement that there is to be a vacancy in Pennsylvania through the resignation of Knox is of too recent date to permit of the lining up of aspirants for the Keystone sena torshlp. Already, however, there have appeared in the field as possible candi dates Representatives James Francis Burke and John Dalzell and George T. Oliver, all of Pittsburg. For many years it has been the recognized policy in Pennsylvania to take one senator from the eastern and one from the western half of the state. Several names have been mentioned in Connecticut connected with the con test for the- seat now occupied by Brandegee, and Representative Hill formally announced his candidacy some time ago. The legislature will de cide the contest, and it is conceded to be close. Probably Kern in Indiana. Not the least interesting of the sena torial fights is in Indiana. Chief among the aspirants are John W. Kern, candi- 

TELLS HiSJTORY. Former Mght Eider Brought to Court Under Protection. He Deserted His Associates and Turned State's Evidence. A COMPLETE STORY Of the Tennessee Raids Drawn From Fehringer. Is An Oath Required of All Who Joined Band of Outlaws. Union City, Tenn., Dec. 21. Sur rounded by a detail of six soldiers with shotted rifles and revolver holsters open, Frank F. Fehringer, member of the riders who has turned state's evidence was brought into court this morning to testify against his former associates of the mask. At the court room door the soldiers with rifles halted. Four other soldiers armed only with revolvers took him in charge. Four ' armed deputy sheriffs cleared a way through the crowd into the aisles and Fehringer was lead to the stand. The soldiers sat down inside the railing facing the throng and heavily armed deputies scattered quietly through the room. It was a tense moment. The witness, a diminutive man, seemed composed but pale. He crossed his tegs nonchalently and I tossed his hi-nari hrimn, v- toe or his boot. The crowd surged up closer, but a stern order from the judge forced them back into their seats. There was no occasion for crowding, how ever, for Fehringer spoke in a clear distinct voice, audible all over the room. Fehringer went on the first ride of the band and visited Marslis store, where there was a feud between riders of Tipton county and those of Obion county. They feared a raid of Tipton county men. The oath, which he said he took, was: "I solemnv swear that T wish to join the Society of Night Riders and i tnat l will never write, tell or talk about anything that happens upon the rides, or in conference." This is the shorter form cf the oath. A longer one was administered to others, and this will be recited by another witness. Fehringer knew all the defendants and had accompanied them on many rides prior to the killing of Captain i-tanKin. Tne night riders garb con sisted of long black coats, black masks trimmed in white and some had false beards attached to the bottom. On one occasion Deputy Sheriff Mays since resigned, one' of the riders came to a meeting unmasked. At this meet ing Garrett Johnson was chosen chief and other captains were named for different localities and authorized to order raids whenever the riders of a certain locality thought they had something to regulate. At times members failed to appear for rides and on these occasions the riders went after the missing men and forced them to so on the rides. OPENS HEADQUARTERS. Cliarles P.

Milwaukee, Wis., Dec. 21. Brandish ing a heav- wooden cross and gesticu lating wildly, an unidentified man Sun day threw worshippers in two Roman Catholic churches into a panic while he struggled to break through the com munion railing to reach the priests who were officiating at early mass. In both places the assailant escaped be fore the police arrived. His description is said to tally closely with that of Gustav Wirth. a fanatic, who shot and killed Sister Theresa at a hospital here last year. date for vice president on the Demo cratic ticket, John E. Lamb of Terre Haute, former Representative Benja min F. Shively of South Bend, and L. Ert Slack of Franklin. That Mr. Kern has more members of the legislature pledged to his support than any other of the candidates is conceded, but it is recognized also that his pledges are still short of the number needed to elect. No movement to unite against Kern Is yet in evidence and it is probable he could be elected. HE 

REGRETS IT, Thornton Hains Sorry His Bro ther JIurdered Annis. Charles H. Roberts Gives Valu able Testimony in Case. "WE'VE GOT HIM NOW." Mrs. Annis Heard This Remark Just Before the Shooting. Witness Warned to Keep Off or Else Get Killed. Flushing, N. Y., Dec. 21. Bvidence that Thornton J. Hains had expressed regret for the act of Captain Hains in shooting William E. Annis, and that he had been endeavoring for some time to prevent the killing was drawn on cross examination from Charles Roberts, a member of the Bayside Yacht club, DisUiCi Attorney Darrin, Assistant Prosecutor E. S. White. Hains as Seen in Court, in Center Below. called to the witness stand as one of the principal witnesses for the state in the trial of Hains as a principal with Captain Peter Hains, jr., his brother, in the slaying of Annis.. "No one is more sorry than I am. I have been trying to prevent this thing for some time," was the statement de veloped from Mr. Roberts, upon which Hains' counsel will rely to a large measure In the defense of the story writer. The witness told a clear story of the shooting, supplying many of the details of the killing not testified to by previous witnesses. Roberts said that Thornton Hains had pointed his re volver at him while the shooting was in progress and threatened his life. The revolvers of the Hains brothers were placed in evidence today. That Thornton Hains was armed in the man ner of the plainsmen was shown today when a leather holster which is strap ped around the waist and enables the owner to make a quick play was identified by Roberts as one taken from Hains after the shooting. District Attorney Darrin informed the court at recess that it would take about five days to present the rest of the state's evidence. Justice Crane then announced that night sessions of the court would be held commencing tomorrow night. Counsel for defense will likely oppose Tiicht sessions. After a two days' adjournment the trial of Thornton J. Hains, charged as a principal with his brotner, captain Peter Hains, in the killing of William E Annis, was resumed before Justice Crane. It is not unlikely that the week will be taken in the presentation of the prosecution. Mrs. Annis WiU Testify. The prosecution plans to call Mrs. Annis either today or tomorrow. Through her testimony the state ex pects to prove not only that Thornton Hains drew his revolver when his brother first opened fire, and by so do ing prevented any , one from saving Annis' life, but that the brothers went to the Bayside Yacht club in search of Annis. Mrs. Annis was in the stage go ing to the club when the Hains broth ers drove by and it is believed that when the brothers saw Mrs. Annis a remark of "We've got him now" was ovTrleard by the wife of the Publ'she District Attorney Darrin has at this iS iv,tontirn of calling Mrs. Claudia Hains, wife of Captain Hains. as a witness for the Prosecution. Dis trict Attorney Darrin said this morn ing: ' mh Hains W ill -Ot lo "Mrs Claudia Hains will not be called as "a witness for the prosecution. She has no knowledge of any material facts in the case, and there never has been any intention of calling her. She knows of no fact that is properly admissible in evidence in the case. Mrs Hams is at her father's home m Winthrop, MASSsensation was caused in court to day when it became known that Dis trict Attorney Darrin angered at the comments made on his conduct of the case prepared to withdraw from the trial, and tender his resignation from office last Saturday. Mr. Darrin fcaid: "I wanted to withdraw summarily j from the case because of the comments made by the court, press and public on the way I have handled this case, but I have been persuaded to continue the prosecution and not. resign from office as I intended." When the trial opened today Charles H. Roberts, a member of the tsaysiae Yacht club, took the stand. He said he went to the club with Mrs. Annis on the stage on the afternoon of August Id. Mr. Roberts said he saw tne oe fendant and his brother. Captain Hains, at the club together with the club mem bers who were on the dock and float when Annis was kHled. . , Held Off by Mains. Mr. Roberts said: "Mr. Funke and the two Andrews were on their boats at the float when the shooting took place. I did not see the Hains brothers before the first shot was fired. "I was standing near the gangway when I observed Annis and Hill's boat coming toward the dock. The boats were coming alongside the dock when I heard a shot and Mrs. Annis scream 'Look out Will.' I started across the float toward Captain Hains, who was in a crouching position. It was then that Thornton Hains stepped in be tween us and, pointing a revolver in my face, said: "Keep off. Keep off, or I will kill you. Mr. Roberts said that Captain Hains was about three feet from Annis. "I stopped when "Hains pointed the gun in my face and saw Annis stagger and fall into the water. I pulled him T. Jenkins out of the water. Annis was placed on the float. The defendant was six or seven feet away. After the first shot I started across the dock and the pis tol was then pointed in my face and it was held there until the firing was over." After the shooting the Hains broth ers moved over to the other side of the float, said Roberts, and defendant lighted a pipe. Captain Hains opened a card case and handed out a card. Robert said: "I said to Captain Hains 'the army must be proud of officers like you.' The defendant said he wanted to ex plain, and I told him I did not want any explanations. I told Thornton Hains 'you are as guilty as your brother. You prevented us from stopping the shooting' and the defend ant replied 'what could I do? He Is my brother.' " The witness said that Thornton Hains took his brother's wrist as if feeling his pulse. "There was a conversation on the float and Mr. Stephens said to the de fendant that it should have been set tled with fists and Hains said 'It is evident that you were not born In this country.' "I asked the Hains brothers if they wanted to commit such crimes why they didn't select some place where women and children would not see it and the defendant replied: 'I am sorry as you are. I have been trying to keep him from doing it for some time.' "The defendant asked If he could have a drink of water, and Mr. Storm remarked 'There is plenty of water In the bay.' "Thornton Hains said to me that he had saved my life, that if I had gone near. his brother I would have been killed. I said, 'That's a nice way to save a man's life, to point a gun in his face and prevent him from saving a 'man's life.' " District Attorney Darrin dre from a satchel on counsel's table a large steel blue revolver which Mr. Roberts identified as the weapon which he picked up on the float, after the shooting. Mr. Roberts identified the revolver which Thornton surrendered after the shooting. This weapon was Initiated "T. H. J." and was of the usual magazine design.

TAX LEVY IS OPPOSED Other Recommendations of Pres ident Receive Support. New Measure Will Increase Scope of Secretary of War. Washington, Dec. 21. Practically the first steps toward a more judicious use of the water powers of the coun try in line wit hthe policy of Presi dent Roosevelt to conserve the na tural resources of the United States are now being taken by the house committee on interstate and foreign commerce In the preparation of a bill to regulate the construction of dams across navigable waters. Preliminary consideration of th subject has developed the fact that there is a strong opposition in con gress to the government levying a tax on the use of the water powers of the navigable waters In spite of sugges tions of the president, that such a tax be required. Subsequent to the veto last spring by the president of the Rainey project, the Interstate and foreign commerce committee of the house ap- jiuimea a suDcommittee to investigate the subject of new lee-islatinn in re gard to the regulation of dams across navigable waters. During the summer and fall, this subcommittee went into various phases of the matter and Chairman Stevens of Minnesota, is now ready to explain to the full com mittee the recommendations of the subcommittee. This will be the first matter considered after the return of tne committee from Panama as it has been set for January 2 2. Members of the committee were asked to consider several constitutional auestiona in volved, such as the power of the gov ernment to levy a tax for the use of water power of navigable streams and the disposition of the dams after the expiration of the permits granted for t uit-ir construction. All the recommendations of the I president in regard to the improve ; ment for the regulation of construe ; tion of dams are agreed to by the sub committee except the recommenda 1 tion that a tax be imposed, i The subcommittee will urge that the committee recommend to the house that the present laws be to amended that the secretary of war may fix charges for the privilege of j constructing a dam. It will make an alternative recommendation that this money either be devoted to restoring condition of navigation to the original ; state before the dam was constructed, or be turned into the treasury to be : applied to the improvement of naviga tion generally. In his message the : president pointed out that while it ap ; peared that under the present law there was a method of forfeiture of permits when conditions were not met, owing to there being no definte imposi tion of the duty of declaring a forfeit ure on any administrative officer, permits were not forfeited. The sub committee will urge that this duty bs imposed on the secretary of war. The committee also has accepted the rec ommendation of the president that there be a specific time Ilmltion on the permits, and has fixed 99 years as the limit. This is done with a view of the public keping control of the great waterways and of the government re taining the right to eventually remova a dam should it become en obstruc tion under changed conditions.
