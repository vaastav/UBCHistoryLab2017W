Showing the course of hot and cold air in an Art Gar­ land stove will, we think, interest the people of Worth ington at this season of the year. I 'L FLOOR You will notice in the cut shown herewith the hot air pipe is in the cen­ ter of the stove and is heated from all sides. That is wnere we get our wonderfullyjstrong circulation of hot air. If you will take the trouble to examine a similar cut of any other stove you will find that the hot air blast flue is on the back of the stove and is heated from one side only. That not only reduces the strength of hot air circulation but.it takes away 20 per cent of the outside radiating surface of the stove. Study the above over carefully and you will understand why an Art Garland base heater can heat as much surface with two tons of coal as any other make with three tons. A Garland costs no more than you can buy an imitation for and you can save $10 in fuel in a single season. Sob PATTSBS05, F.

Wool now worth fifteen cents .and shrink­ ing sixty per cent, is taken as the ba* silof these calculations, and may very fairly considered as a represent­ ative or average qualitiy. A suit of clothes requiring for its manufacture seven pounds scoured or 171-2 pounds in the grease weuld be unus­ ually heavy but the additional out­ lay for the wool necessary to make this suit would be only $1 more at present than under the Free-Trade conditions of last Cyear. It is readily seen, therefore, that under present Tariff conditions the wool grower reaps a decided benefit, while the consumer is not seriously inconvenienced by the difference in in the price of his clothing. These figures regarding the price of cloth­ ing are based upon the supposition that clothing has advanced in price, but other factors have been at work, and the fact is it may be purchased as cheaply now as under the former Tariff.—Wool Cecord. Congressman McCleary seems to have mortally offended the edi tors of the Worthington 

ADVANCE and Mountain Lake View, both re publicon papers. And all on ac­ count of post office appointments. Without question Mr. McCleary tries to do right in the distribution of patronage but he has a hard job on his hands. Up to the pre­ sent time he has been fortunate in satisfying almost everyone in the securing of appointments. It now begins to look, however, as the riv­ er that flows on the greatness will be full of snags, and if he would avoid shipwreck he better hold hard on the helm.—St. James Ga­ zette. Look here, Brother Nicholson, havn't you tumbled to the fact that the right which has dominat­ ed in the post office appointments in a good many towns, is the same kind that can turn the greatest number of votes to Mr. McCleary when he comes up for re-election? If you have not we would refer you to the people of Fairmont, Worth ington, Pipestone, etc., towns of considerable importance. We give Mr. McCleary credit for being one of the "cutest" politicians in this section, and whatever the county bosses, who favor McCleary, say, goes, in the matter of post office appointments,without much regard to other people. You may get taste of it before you are through Windom will.—Windom Citizen, We said a few weeks ago that, "the man who receives the repub­ lican nomination for governor of Minnesota next year should be a man of clean personal character with an official record and connec­ tion that need not be apologized for, and be a man who is able to go out and lead the fight We have done enough carrying the candi­ date about cn a pedestal to be looked at and apologized for." Mr. Weaver hardly sizes up to this standard. We do not know that there can be very much said against his personal character or business honesty. Neither do we know that he has ever filled any position that would bring out his executive ability and prove his fitness for the position of governor of the great Btate of Minnesota. It is true if he would show good judgment in the selection of a pri­ vate secretary the business might rnn along all right, as it has done before. But we do not want to elect a man governor who has got to depend on his private secretary to fill the governor's chair. Mr. Weaver may possess the ability,we do not know,he has not been tried, but there is a great deal of differ­ ence between making sale contracts for threshing machines and being the chief executive of this great commonwealth. Besides Mr. Weaver is too close­ ly connected with the Clough ma­ chine and one thing the people are going to insist on above all others is that the last bit at that old wk chine shall be cleaned out. Mr. Weaver was going about the state two years ago fixing things for Governor Clough's nomination. We know to a certainty that he was here for that purpose, and it is be­ lieved an understanding was had at thattime that he should be their candidate in 1898. Why is it that the authorative announeement of Mr. Weaver's candidacy should come from Lu verne and Sleepy Eye simultan­ eously and not through the papers of his own county,except that he has no support at home. We would be glad to see a man from the Sec­ ond district elected governor if we have a man that is a candidate who will be a credit to the district and state, but we are not going to sup­ port a man stmply because he lives in the second district. As to the candidate being able to go ont and lead the fight. We never heard of Mr. Weaver mak­ ing a speech or trying to, and we believe the Republicans of this state are done carrying a candi­ date around sitting him upon a platform with a placard upon his storage department, reading'."This is the Sepublican candidate for Governor." We can't make location every­ thing in the selection of a candi­ date for so important a position. With such a man as ,Evans, Col­ lins, Clapp, Eustis or YanSant, we cocld go before the people with some show of strength in the can­ didate himself.—Madelia Messen­ ger.

Washington Letter. (From Onr Regular Correspondent.) WASHINGTON. Dec. 10,1897. The most astounding thing brought to light by the first week of the session of Congress is the audacity of the agents of the lob­ by which is trying to prevent the annexation of Hawaii. It is only necessary for a senator or repre­ sentative of prominence to express in private conversation the slight est douot of the wisdom of annex­ ation to have these agents an­ nounce through such newspapers as they control or can by hook or crook obtain space in cash is un­ questionably paid in some in­ stances—that the senator or repre­ sentative in question is straining every nerve to defeat annexation. They have thus misrepresented Senator Morrill and Hoar and Speaker Reed. It seems as cer­ tain as anything can be that such audacity is in the end bound to re­ act upon those who employ it, and to result in making more votes for annexation than against ii. This lobby was started by the sugar trust, but there are reasons for be lieving that a portion of the mon­ ey it is spending so liberally comes from the secret funds of three foreign nations which desire to prevent annexation, but have no reasonable excuse for attempt­ ing to do so openly. Some of the democratic senators who talk the loudest against trusts, during a campaign, are acting in concert with the sugar trust now. In fact with two exceptions, Gorman and Morgan, all the democratic sena­ tors appear to have landed, bag and baggage, in the lobbist's camp. Senator Davis, of Minn., chairman of the committee on foreign rela­ tions, which has charge of the treaty, is thoroughly confident that annexation will be accomplish ed through the treaty, and abso lutely certain that a bill providing for annexation can be passed by both Senate and House,should the power of the lobby be sufficient to prevent the ratification of the fcrea ty. It is his intention to push the matter to a conclusion in the Sen ate at the earliest possible mo­ ment. Senator Chandler, chairman of the committee on elections and privileges, says that committee will decide upon its report in the Oregon case at its next meeting and that he has no doubt the re­ port will be in favor of seating Hon. H. W. Corbett, as successor to Hon. J. H. Mitchell, whose term in the Senate expired last March. If the democrats who have expressed themselves in fav­ or of seating Mr. Corbett vote that way he will be seated. The House committee on appro­ priations broke the record when it reported the pension approprition bill to the House this week, thus furnishing evidence that Chairman Cannon and the industrious mem­ bers of his committee intend to do their part towards pushing the lm perative business of the sesson, in order to help the project for early adjournment, which is generaly favored by the republicans. The Pension bill carries $141,218,830, of which $140,000,000 is for the payment of pensions. It has already been made ap­ parent that a serious attempt is wing to be made atthis session of Congress to modify the civil ser­ •*r-— vice rules. President McKinley having said in his annual message that he believed many, positions were now embraced by the civil service rules which ought not to be republicans in Congress do not feel that they are antagonizing himor tho party platform in taking part in this movement, although so good a republican as Representa tive Johnson, of Indiana, has told them in a speech made in reply to Gen. Grovsner, of Ohio, that he disagreed with them. Gen. Grovs nor's idea, which he will endeavor to get through in the shape of a bill,is that the only employes of the government who should be em braced by the civil service rules are the clerks whose duties are not executive, in the departments at and employes of the postal service in all its branches. All other po­ sitions he desires to have thrown open and the democrats' who new fill nine-tenths of them thrown out to make room for the republi­ cans. PresidentMcKinley's being de­ tained at Canton by his sad duty has not in any manner inconven­ ienced Congress, as he arranged all matters requiring his personal attention before starting upon his last trip to the bedside of his dy­ ing mother. Everywhere his name is mentioned the deepest sympa­ thy is expressed for him. The committee ou banking and curreney has obtained permission from the House to sit daily during sessions of the House, and will at once endeavor to agree upon one or more bills embodying portions of the financial recommendations made by the president in his an­ nual message and by Secretary Gage in his annual report to Con­ gress. Secretary Gage has been asked to put his ideaS into a bill and submit it to the committee. The conservative men in Con­ gress, regardless of party, approve of the position President McKin­ ley took in his message, on Cuban affairs, and the matter will be left in his hands.
