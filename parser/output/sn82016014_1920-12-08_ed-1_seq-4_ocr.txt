Director, Washing ton, I'. C ; Southern cotton growers are plan- " nine to cut the acreage of that staple in half next year ant devote the land ; thus freed to the production of food crops. They are doing; this In face of repeated assertions that growers ''of food products are loslpg- money, i Untltr such conditions what the southern farmers make thru an In- l creased price of cotton they stand to ' lose on the grain which they shall , produce. The plan Is a little rough on the grain growers of the west and . north, because they cannot offset It by devoting any portion of their land ; to the production of cotton. When farmers hava tried all other alleged panaceas for bringing relief from their troubles, perhaps they will resort to ' organisation, a system which will ln " elude the fixing of their own prices -, and the marketing of their crops ; without the intervention of specula ; tors and gamblers. The flag of Great Britain waves t over a million square miles of terrl- tory more than it did prior to the war In Europe. Her control over this vast area of territory, much of which is , rich in resources and capable of ex tensive commercial development, will ' bring to Great Britain's business and ?. commerce an Immense ' revenue. There Is no need for the people of the ' United States to become solicitous as ito the future of the British empire or . its ability" to repay the loans extended by the United States and on which the American taxpayer Is now paying the interest. Great Britain is able, and, it Is to be assumed, willing, to pay both the principal of the debt an! the Interest due thereon. Secretary of the Treasury Houston has announced that the issue and sale .' of government savings securities will be continued thru 1921. In addition to the savings securities already famil- - lar to. investors the treasury an nounces the addition of a $1 savings stamp and a $25 registered savings ' certificate. The 1 stamp will be non interest bearing, will be bright red in color. Imprinted on a green tint, and will bear the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. The $25 certificate will be Similar In design and terms to' the i $100 and $1,000 treasury savings cer- tif Icates, which will also be offered in j 1921, to mature January 1, 1988. The large amount of wheat remain ing in farmers' hands is attributed to ! two causes inability to obtain cars and unsatisfactory prices. If cars had been obtainable earlier, probably prices would have slumped much . sooner than they did. A wave of governmental economy is plotured as coming, and if, as Sen ator Smoot is reportedto have said, . half the present federal employes can " and will be taken off the pay-roll, it Is claimed that one billion dollars can be saved the first year of the Repub lican administration. But probably little In the way of a reduction of ex penses or a reform of the taxation system can be expected of the con gress now.in session. Instead of tak ing steps in these directions, the first -thing it did was to take up plans to help the farmer and shut off immi gration. Legislation in the interest of the whole people should come first. Class legislation. If necessary, can corns later. Besides it may be that the farmers problem and the labor unions' problem of immigration will right themselves if given a little more time. . Constantino has been elected king ef Greece by an almost unanimous vote. There was no opposing candi date. (The Greeks appear to have known what they wanted and ,el about getting it in a way that cannot be .misunderstood, protests of the al lieswtere disregarded. It will be In- teresting to note what the 'big pow- ers will da about it. President Wil son, who believes In the self determi nation of peoples, may be expected promptly to recognize the new govern ment of Greece as soon as the coro nation has taken place. The return of Constantino to the throne probably will lax tns foundation foF another Balkan war. Greece was little hurt by the one recently closed and should be In good fighting trim. 

THIS PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Departing from his custom of deliv ering his messages to congress in per son a custom of eight years- stand ing t President Wilson yesterday communicated with that body thru a messenger. The message bore indi cations of having been written by a man beaten physically and in spirit. It brings the thought that all the fight has been taken out of him, ,' The disappointment which the president must feel over the failure of the League of Nations to obtain the approval of the nation is plainly ap-1 parent, altho he did not refer to it directly. His recommendations are for the most part commonplace, cov ering economy budget legislation, re vision of the tag laws and provision for disabled soldiers. All these might have been expected rom any presi dent. A departure from the' ordinary is seenm the suggestion of a. loan to Armenia. This apparently proceeds front the altruistio nature of the chief executive. It certainly does not pos sess the merit of a good business proposition. Money loaned to Ar menia, might as well be cast into the sea as far as any hopeof ever getting it back goes. Another feature of the message worthy of note Is that calling for the independence of the Philippines. It is remarkable in view of the fact that th6 president's party during the years that it has been in entire control of the government has made no move In that direction. On the eve of yielding th'j command of the nation's affairs to the opposition he puts Philippine In dependence squarely up to the new administration. The fact that the president of the failed Homewocd, Kan., bank lives In Minnesota and the vice president re sides in North Dakota may create a suspicion' that they are members ot the Nonpartisan League. It Is quite the ordinary thing for banks with which the leaguers are connected to fail. 

LKGISLATION AS A REMEDY. When anything goes wrong in this country, somebody always is ready to remedy the evil by suggesting the en actment of a new law. Looking back over the history of congress and legis latures, one might reach the conclu sion that enough laws have been passed to cover every contingency, but apparently thaj call for legislation con tinues unabated. The legislation which seems In greatest demand Just now Is some thing along the line of enabling the farmer to obtain a higher price- for his crops. Congressman Steenerson of Minnesota stands ready to supply the need with a bill to levy a tariff on im ports of Canadian wheat and flour. If Mr. Steenerson's plan would work It might satisfy the American pro ducer of wheat, altho it would be hard on the remainder of the peopla who do not produce their own bread. Senator Capper proposes to perform a similar service for the farmers by taxing the boards of trade out of ex istence. The agricultural Interests of America probably never will be great ly benefited by beating down those o. other countries or those of citizens engaged In other lines of business. People, like nations, are Interde pendent and no one class or nation long can profit at the expense of an other. This fact is well Illustrated in a bulletin Issued by the Guaranty Trust company of New York, which says: . . No nation, .no community, no Indi vidual can now live alone. Economic Interdependence is such that distress or disaster in one country is inevitably reflected in every other country. When Russian markets fail, for ex ample, the industries of Great Britain, of South America, of the United States feel the effects. When the great sources of raw materials fail or the free flow of such materials thruqut the world is seriously Interfered with, then industrial countries must close their plants, and workmen must leave their machines. Thus, a Massachustts truck-farmer, for instance, might fail to lift the mortgage on his half dozen acres be cause flax ceased to come out of Rus sia. Because there was no flax, Irish linen manufacturers turned away their operators. These in turn could not buy shoes and that fact swept across the Atlantic to New England.' These shoemakers left their lasts and cur tailed their purchases at the grocery store and the groceryman tn turn cut down his receipts of vegetables from the truck farmer. It may be that the truck-farmer's analysis of the situa tion would extend no farther than the city which had been his market, be cause the effects of a flax shortage in Russia were communicated to him slowly and by indirection. Had he been a producer on a large scale, how ever, one who had built up a foreign market and maintained it as the soured of that marginal profit thru which his domestic business was but tressed and stabilized, his understand ing of primary causes would have been swift and sure. Whether the effect comes slowly or swiftly, directly or in directly, whether it is clearly under stood or not, eventually and .inevita bly it does come. And that is why the American farmer cannot escape a direct interest in what is happening in Europe, in the financial crises in Japan and Cuba, in the depression in Aus tralia and South America. The first bill offered In this session of congress was one to prohibit im migration for two years. This prob- a.bly will start a stampede amon-j. those anxious to ret over whn tim getting over is good. TOPEKA STATE JOURNAL 'Information Bureau FREDERIC J. HASRIN, Director, Washington, D. C THE RELUCTANT PRICE. Washington, D. C, Dec 6. We are informed on all hands that prices are toppling, but the topple is certainly a long time in reaching the ultimate con sumer. A few -dollars saved'on an overcoat, gasoline a cent a gallon cheaper, and a. few stable food prod ucts perceptibly lower is about the ex tent of the benefits which have come to one typical member of that harrieekl class. And sT large crop of differences of opinion can be gathered as to bow far and how fast prices are coming down ; in the Immediate future. Some tell us j that forces are at work which must ! inevitably bring all prices down a great deal in a relatively short time. But others assure us that as soon as' the currency is stabilized and congress has amended the tariff law so as to keep out imports, as it undoubtedly intends " J;. Prloe? wl tend to stick at a hierh fieure for a lone time. The situation at present seems to be that, before a substantial price reduc tion can reach the ultimate consumer, each of the factors in the production and distribution ef the necessaries of life has got to take a' loss. And each of them, not unnaturally, is unwilling to do so. Each of them prefers that the ultimate consumer should go on taken the loss, as he has been doing for the past several years. It cannot be denied that the strong point in the position of the ultimate consumer is that he dees not buy much. He has at last revolted against high prices. If he will only continue to buy scantily and to hunt fo the bargains which crop up here and there in increasing numbers, prices will un doubtedly continue to come down for a while, at least. Tariff changes and the end of deflation may check the tendency, but prices will already have come down a good ways, and it will be hard to force them up again. This process will be hard on the retailer for a while, but perhaps better for all con cerned in the long run than a con tinued campaign of extravagant buy ing. The Process. This seems to be the present process of price reduction: Th'e retailer has a hard time selling the goods on his shelf, but he naturally hates to take a loss on them, or even a reduced profit, so he holds out for the old price as long as he possibly can, and advertises a reduction sale only when forced to do so by the need of money. Meantime he refuses to buy new orders of goods from the wholesaler and the manufacturer, even at some what lower prices. The result is that the manufe;tuer, rather than pro duce goods which he cannot sell at a good price or cannot sell at all, closes his factory for a while and throws half of his force out of work. These men out of work cannot buy, and as their number grows, the demand for goods which comes to the retailer decreases. But he must sell something in order to pay his rent and his interest charges and other overhead expenses' So he is forced to reduce prioes, and that forces the manufacturer to reduce the price to him. There seems to , be no doubt but that this process will -bring prices down. Just as sure as a stone thrown into the air will fall. Unemployment is steadily Increasing and prices will come down just about in proportion to that increase. Means Suffering. It Is a cruel process. It means a hard struggle and some failures among retailers and manufacturers of the smaller and weaker sort. It means already hundred of thousands of men out of work. And men out of work mean hungry men, and what is worse, hungry children and hungry mothers. The gist of the matter is that man. . in his Industrial system, has created a machine which he does not under stand and cannot run. No one is really happy about this process except the ultimate consumer, apd he is not very hippy because he is not only the ultimate consumer who gets the re duced price, but also the shopkeeper. the manufacturer and the laborer j who lose money. The only class which really stands to make a clear gain is the salaried class. Of course, salaries may come down, but they will not come down as rapidly or easily as wages. The eovernmcnt employe, for ex ample, who got an inadequate raise uf B8 ner rent during the war, ana aimosi starved, may soon find himself better eff than some friend of his who runs a store, and who made barrels of money during the war bu' who is now in a way to lose some of it. - . So the salaried man, it Tie can resist a reduction, stands to gain, but every one else stands to lose. And appar- ently there is no way to avoid this loss exceDt to Dass It on "to the other fellow. That is what everyone is trying to do. Consider the apple for instance. You stall pay 5 cents apiece, or 10 cents for three, selected Ben Davis apples at a fruit stand on a city street. Do you know wnat me iarmer got tor those apples? Well, farmers near here got about $ 2 a barrel. The empty wooden barrels ir which they pack the apples cost them $1-25 each. The cos" of havine; the apples picked was 48 fcents a barrel. By the time he had hauled the apples to a railway station the farmer vas lucky If he broke even. Many a farmer left the apples hanging on the trees. Many another took them to a cider mill, had the juice pressed out, let it get hard, and tried to drown his sorrow in it. fanner Loses. What does this -mean! It means primarily that the farmer Is the first goat. He is the goat also in wheat. Wheat that It cost him $2.1 a bushel to raise, according to the department of aarlculture. recently brought in the market $1.85 a bushel. But do" you notice that bread isany cheaper or in anything like the proportion that wheat has declined in price? You dof' not. , You, the consumer, are the sroat at one end, and the farmer is the goat at the other end. as is the laborer. The farmer Is really a laborer in most cases, altho he is Just beginning to realize tne raeu That is. he has neith er the capital nor the organization to enable him to hold out. He must sell the sweat of his brow day by day, or at least year by year. In order to live, as does the working man. Hence the wholesaler, tne Jobber and the retailer, who have capital and organization, are able to pass on the loss in staples to the-farmer. and keep up the pnee to the consumer. The wholesaler says to the retailer: "I cannot sell you apples much cheaper mis year man tasi; me price must te kept up." But to the farmer he points out that he is heavily stocked with foodstuffs and that the people are not buying them. He dees net really need so many apples this vear. He of- ffrs two dollars a barrel, and save: "Take it or leave it." The farmer has to take it. He baa no storage facili- ties, and no money. He has to sell, but the wholesaler does' net have to buy. At least, his need is not so press ing. 6e the farmer and laborer at one end lose money, and the consumer at the other still pays high prices, while the great organized Industry of distri bution and manufacture stands pat. . Nevertheless, it is not happy. It Is killing the goose that laid the golden egg. It faces a dwindling-, demand, and it can stimulate demand only by reducing prices. So, slowly, with much repeat and suffering, we get back to what our president-elect calls "normalcy." The Woman He Married BY 

JANE PHELPS RICHARD, JR., ARRIVES. CHAPTER . X. -My darling boy was born the day mother arrived. She took charge of the house,, let the maid Dick had hired go, insisting she would do what was necessary. She would - let the nurse remain for a week, then she, too, could go. ' Dick was telling me all this so hap pily, and was so grateful to mother, too, that it made me ashamed. "She is . wonderful!" he said. "With our $200 and her -she is as good as a thousand -we'll get. along famously." "But we haven't any $200," I said weakly. "Why yes' we have. Nan. I mustn't talk to you, I am tiring you," thought ful as always. "No, we haven't. I had to- have seme things before baby came so I drew it taut." I had drawn it the Mon day after that awful sermon and paid all I owed. I didn't dare wait any longer. "But r- why whaW?'' he had turned ashen. "I'm too weak and sick to talk about it, Dick," I moaned and he com forted me. as he called himself a brute for even asking me what I had eone with it at such a time. But that ashen color did not leave hisace, and as he left me I noticed his hand trembled when he raised it from the coverlet. But he knew! Now I could rest. Of course he would pay all the bills connected with my illness. It was silly of him to fuss about them. He could pay them as he could, just as Clara Watson paid 'for things. That night I slept soundly, so de lighting mother and the nurse. Long afterward mother told me that Dick went oirfr and took a long walk, did not come in until after midnight, and that even then he must have been up all night as she heard him in the liv ing room where ' he was ' sleeping, writing, or walking-the floor. "He.was very anxious and nervous about you, dear. Not many girls have more thoughtful, more loving hus bands. Be sure you always deserve his consideration." At the end of the week the nurse left. I asked no questions, as to whether she was paid, or if so, how? I really didn't care. Dick had not mentioned my drawing the money again; probably Would not anyway until I was perfectly well. It wasn't his way. ' ' I was feeling fine, and the' -baby was so good. We had named him Richard, after his fathar. but Wtild call him ' Junior. I declared I would get all mixed up with two Dicks ih -tOve house. . p . r ,t I wonder if we ever appreciate our mothers until we get old ourselves. Mother did everything. She took care of me and the baby, she cooked and sewed, she marketed jwhen Clara or some one was with, kne, andtrnaije Dick's money go twice as 1st' as I could. -S ". "If you select all you buy and; Bring it home with you, you'll find you have far better, fresher food, and that it will cost you less. Never get lrrto the habit of ordering over the telephone. dear.

While the Qo nest dealer win respect yuu, you You will do better even with him by juagment, ana De anxious 10 serve yuu rininer a I sav." Clara Watson was with me. when mother spoke. She said: "Oh, Mrs. Hardy, one can't always go to market! It is such a nuisance to get dressed for the street lust tq market." "It is the only way for people in moderate circumstances to keep their table expenses down, especially now when food is so very high." I could see Clara theught mother terribly old-fashioned, so I broke in: "You see, Clara, in the country everyone goes to market." , I had the habit of calling the small town where I had lived "country." "They meet land have a fine time gossiping, don't thev. mothefr?" "Yes, we see our friends. And that is not harmful. .We talk over little home affairs, get ideas for new dishes, or how to make some new sort of preserve. But that isn't the idea. Nan. It Is the real saving of money, and at the same time getting better food- I hope you will never get the telephone habit." For months I had scarcely shopped any other way. But I said nothing, altho I was honest enough to feel a bit indignant when Clara, who knew, winked at me. I made up mymind after she had gone that I would take that; advice of mother's. I was out of debt. I would keep out. I would save In every way. That we owed the doctor, the nurse, and the druggist, worried me . not at all. That was Dick's affair.

What business of hers Is it, I'd like to know, how we raise money when it's as plain as a pikestaff that we need it so badly?" - "We certainly do need It," sister Nora retorted. "Look at that!" stick ing out her foot in & ragged white silk - stocking. "Five dollars a pair for anything decent to go with pumps. I'd like to hang these wicked prof iteers." "Shut up, fool!" Mrs. Gray flung back, coarsely. "The more money they make the easier it is to get our share of it. But don't you dare go shopping extravagantly till this Haywood girl blows over. I wonder who, if any body, is behind her!" "Maybe she's butting in so as to be bought out," Nora suggested Mes. Gray nodded. "I've thought of thati wish I dared try her and find out. We must do something right away, or she will queer our game- " "Suppose , we investigate her ask Peterkin about her? We can make out he's her sponsor; you know he brought her up from the station in his car " "He wouldn't have dene it but for the big rain," Mrs. Gray complained. "That gave her a chance at him, if she had the sense to see it. 'Phone him to call hero cn his way to-headquarters. Anything is better than this feeling of sitting on a bomb." Peterkin, otherwise Peter Linley, Esq., for all his guileless counte nance, was lawyer enough to know a cross-examination when he met it square in his path, however skillfully it was disguised. The recognition made him suddenly alert. He had not thought much about Rena Haywood, except that she was soft-spoken and decidedly easy to look at She had asked him a single ques tion what place was best and pleas antest for the housing of a young woman casual thus she had found shelter with Mother Bigby. once Peter's nurse, and still holding him at once her conscience keeper and court of last resort. Rena sensed as much from the look in her eyes, the tone of her veice and rejoiced silently that things were fall ing out so well. She was beginning a difficult enterprise success In it meant more than mere money profit tho she did not affect to despise that side. Her managing edir had said: "Go after the pair of goshawks in pet ticoats that are plundering small town folk in the name of sweet charity: if you get the goods on them, or even a promising lead, wire John Smith, care this office, 'Pork is rising' and leave us to- do the rest." Since Peter had given her specially in charge, Mrs. Bigby had talked to Rena as a familiar friend. Thus she had come to know all about the drive for devastated Mesopotamia that Mrs. Gray and sister Nora were conducting at a breathless rate. They had all the equipments statistics, lantern slides showing ruined villages and starving peasants, not to name horrors they slurred over with bare hints. Both talked well. Nora could cry beautifully when she begged for the poor hungry babies. The pair were effusively grateful for any offering, monev. nledges thereof, trinkets. clothes, household stores. "We can use. anything anything.! rememoer, Mrs. .Gray's appeals usually ended. In. result she got anything, everything and nothing. . No heed of particulars. All of- us know about sucn ingamer ings. S - Swift and canny workers, the sis ter banked all money, and almost in stantly drew drafts on it, payable to tho home office In a distant city. Cash, theyl explained, was needed for the shipment away of supplies. . Certainly things contributed were sent away quickly, always prepaid, and variously consigned. Peter had given them a decent check. He never tnrnir a deaf ear to any appeal. But after that his contribution was- lim ited to the use of his car now ana then. He could not oe prevailed on to speak In- behalf of the drive, nor to stand sponsor for its, conductoss among his rich friends. Naturally the ladies were Inly furi ous with him, but cream was no simile for the outer seeming toward him. They bore his chaffing beautifully, were not too grateful for his aid and countenance; in short, were so lady like they almost overdid it. He was. in fact, their real objective. The drive industry was on its last legs. Even with new wars and devastations, a sated public was not likely to give up. Wherefore it behoove Sister Nora either to get a rich husband or to find a man who would 'pay roundly to escape being that person. Straight matrimony was, of course, preferable rosy visions of it had danced before them until Rena Hay wood appeared. She had come ito them a volunteer willing worker but with such notions wanting authenti cations, the giving of guarantees and chartered accountings so piausime withal, they had had to listen and even to temporize. How could they do otherwise when she had fetched in by way of introduc tion a fat check from the richest and stingiest man In town? It was open sesame to their financial methods. Rena listened, jotting things down In her notebook, with believing eyes and. an infantine smile. They moved Mrs. Gray to say ten tatively at their next encounter after Peterkin had failed to give up any in formation: "My dear girl, we love your enthusiasm and disinterestedness but you're such a baby, we really must look out for you. It isn't enough to work for a noble purpose r-workers must get a living same as the rest of the world. New it happens you can help us magnifieently. You see we are' pressed for time this town has done fairly still it is way below its quota. And we are dated up in a lot of other tow rs now if we can only get the $5,000 we lack why we can go on, and possibly give you the same chances in the other places we offer you here. "What chances?" Rena asked. Mrs. Gray almost whispered: "If you'll get a check for that amount from Peter Linley we'll give you a third no wait ing to bank it either -and we won't use his name Just announce It from the platform. An Unknown Friend " "You would really do that?" Rena interrupted. 'Certainly; It's hardly more than the usual tiling," Mrs. Gray answered eagerly. "We might make it half. If you bring In the check this afternoon." Nora, looking at her sister ever Rein's head., nodded, saying ihaudi bly, since both were expert lipreaders, "Make M half outright," and smiling triumphantly. Rena was, after all. turning out a providence. - Peter was sweet on her. Confronted with his own check for such a sum. as evidence of grounds for breach of promise, he would never risk going to extremities. And once he had settled he would be - V ., . .. as good as an annuity. Here her med itations were rudely interrupted. Pe ter had eome in. Rena was asking him plumply 'for the money, and ex plaining her profit if he gave it. At first he got white, then something in her eyes reassured him. He took her hands, saying gayly: "No need for yeu ta go snacks with anybody. Give me leave to do it- and I'll draw checks to your order the rest of our natural j lives." "So you are resigning throwing up ! noble -purposes for a mere man," the managing editor said when he had heard the whole story. But the wed ding presents to Rena from himself and the paper .re likely to live long in office history. (Copyright. 19-.U by the McClnre News-Di-per Syndicate.)

(Croat Phtladtlpbia PabUe Ledger.) "No longer Is silk underwear con sidered a personal. Intimate gift," writes one of the leading authors of advertising ''copy." From which W. A. T. concludes that the vaccination mark Is about the only "personal, in timate gift" left. All of which leads to certain other "personal, intimate' reflections .and inspires in us the desire to answer th question of "Curious," who wants to know if we can tell him "why it is about so many girls that the back of their neck is prettier than tbe front of their face." The conclusion reached by "Curi ous" is not in agreement with our own observations. And, since nearly ev erybody will want to know what we think about it, our opinion is that a girl always looks better coming than she does going. A girl in the act of receding is handicapped by her hat, which never looks as well behind as it does in fretjt. j Peculiarities and idiosyncrasies of conformity, gait and carriage are also more noticeable in the receding wo man. Where does "Curious" get that stuff? We have, as you had noted, gene over the matter pretty thoroly. We have treated all of its various aspects. We did so because one can't leave anyr thing to-the iieople. When they are able to settle a thing, which is Infre quently, they nearly always settle it wrong. THe people axe kindly and neighborly. They du the best they can. But they do try our reactionary soul. "I was amazed and shocked," writes C. p. S., 'at your admission that you have no morals. 'I had assumed you were a gentleman that otherwise you would not be employed in your present capacity." All we can do is to counsel C. D. S. to go on reading the column. If our admission that we have no morals shocked her, there is a fine line of seismic disturbances in store for her. We have a lot of good stuff we've never pulled. t The Woman's Patriot Is quoted as saying: Lady Astor's first great tri ,un ph as a member of parliament has long since passed.

She also told of her reluctance to attend the funeral or to be "mixed up" In any way with the magnificent tribute paid to Ha raon's memory by his fellow citizens. ; Now, we claim a woman who has he strength of character and the poor taste publicly to .criticise a dead man is bound te attract and hold wide spread public attention.
