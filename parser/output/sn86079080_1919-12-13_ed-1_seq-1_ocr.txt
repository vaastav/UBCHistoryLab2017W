"PUSSYFOOT" JOHNSON RIDES A PLANK "'Pussyfoot, Pussyfoot,' where have you been?" "I've been to Lon don to preach against gin." "'Pussy foot, Pussyfoot.' what saw you there?" "Some medical students put flour in / my hair." Alsp "P'ussyfoot" was rid- " den on a plank. Moreover.. he got a . [. black eye--which may result In the ' loss of its sight. . ' . All of which happened to William E. Johnson, a mild-mannered American antisaloon crusader who has scared Merrie England half to death with his prohibition campaign. He has even scored great success in Glasgow, where the canny Scots believe with Robert Burns that "freedom and whisky gang thegither." Johnson was a student in the Uni versity of Nebraska something like 30 years qgo. He engaged in business in Lincolnfor a time. In the early nine ties he became connected with the government as an agent for running down men selling liquor to Indians, and while in this work he engaged in many controversies and once nearly lost his life. On account of the danger connected with the work he adopted quiet but effective methods that gave him the name of "Pussyfoot," and put him well at the head of this branch of the service. GLASS LEAVES TREASURY FOR SENATE Carter Glass, secretary of the treasury, was appointed by Governor Davis to succeed the late Thomas 8. Martin as United States senator from Virginia. Secretary Glass consulted President Wilson and then announced that he would accept the appointment. The term of Senator Martin would have expired in 1925. Mr. Glass was a representative In congress from the Lynchburg district of Virginia and was chairman of the committee on banking and currency . when in December, 1918, he was ap pointed by President Wilson to suc ceed William G. McAdoo as secretary of the treasury. He is owner of the Daily' Newt of Lynchbburg and the Daily Advance, an afternoon paper of the same city. He is sixty-one years of age. Mr. Glass was a member of the Virginia state senate for six years be fore going to congress. He wih elected to congress in 1902 and served there continuously as representative of the Sixth district of Virginia up to the time of his appointment as secretary of the treasury. t Sir Thomas J. Lipton, Bart., jolly old sea dog, arrived in New York the other day bound on the same old er rand-to lift "the mug," as he calls I the America's cup. This will be his 3 fourth attempt-T ersistence, thy name I is Lipton. He names Shamrock IV as I challenger and wants to sail over the sante old Sandy Hook course. Ho 3 does, however, specify June instead of September-so the Jersey skeeters will will not eat him up; also because he thinks there will be more wind. Sir Thomas inaugurated his fourth attempt to lift the America's cup in 1913 with a challenge for a race the following year. The challenge was ac cepted and the challenging yacht, Shamrock IV, was en route* t this country under its own sails when war was declared. The Shamrock IV put into Bermuda and later reached New York after the danger of capture by German ships had passed. With the beginning of the world war the international yacht race was abandoned and the Shamrock IV was placed in drydock in Erie basin. The American yachts Resolute and Vanitie were also withdrawn from the races the following season. 

WHITLOCK: AMBASSADOR TO BELGIUM To raise Brand Whitlock, who has been minister to Belgium for six years, to the rank of ambassador and return o him to Belgium is a deserved compli- I ment to a man who has served his own country and the one to which he was I accredited with so much tact and abil ity that King Albert's government has desired his reappointment, and the president's c mpliance is satisfactory to Americans of both parties. No American diplomat had a more difficult place to fill. Before we en- J tered the war it was necessary for him t to remain on formally courteous terms t with the Germans who assumed con trol of Belgium.

WILSON'S MESSAGE READ TO CONGRESS LABOR UNREST AND HIGH COST OF LIVING IS DISCUSSED. General Recommendation for Return of the United States To Peace Basis. Washington.-A diversified program to restore a peace time business stat Sus, revise the tax system, curb un rest, reduce the cost of living and rec tify labor and farming conditions, was recommended by President Wilson Tuesday in his message to the new session of congress. The president asked for new tariff laws based on the nation's changed relation to the rest of the world, sug gested that the income and excess profits tax schedules be simplified, advocated steps to improve rural con ditions and promote production, and declared for a "genuine democratiza tion of industry" to protect both'la bor and capital. The president's principal recommen datioas were: Establishment of a budget system for the national finances. Reorganization of the taxation sys tem, with simplification of the income and excess profits. Readjustment of the tariff system, if necessary, to meet changed world conditions and make the system con form with the fact that the United States is "the greatest capitalist in the world." Recognition and relief for veteran soldiers of the world war, particularly in the way of government farms, as proposed by Secretary Lane. Proper measures to foster the dye stuffs industry built up during the war to keep the United States independent of foreign supply. An enlarged program for rural de velopment, in recognition of the farm ers' part in the war. Measures which "will remove the causes of political restlessness in our body politic." At this point the president made his most extensive reference to the peace treaty by saying the causes for the unrest "are superficial rather than deep-seated," and that they "arise from or are connected with the failure on the part of our government to ar rive speedily at a just and permanent peace, permitting return to normal con ditions, from the transfusion of radical theories from seething European cen ters pending such delay from heartless profiteering, resulting from the in crease of the cost of living, and lastly from the machinations of passionate and malevolent agitators. With the return to normal conditions this unrest will rapidly disappear. Several recommendations, some re newals of previous ones, were made by the president to bring down the cost of living. Among them were ex tension of the food control law to peace times for the emergency; regulations for transportation of foods in inter state commerce; a coal storage law modeled after the law in New Jersey; a law requiring markets to show the length of time foods are kept in stor age, and a law to secure "competitive selling and prevent unconscionable profits" by federal license of corpora tions selling food in interstate com merce. Clerks Read Message. For the second time only since the president established the practice of addressing congress in person his mes sage was read today by the clerks. To the Senate and House of Repre- I sentatives: '"I sincerely regret that I can not be present at the opening of this session I of the congress. I am thus prevented from presenting in as direct a way as I t could wish the many questions that I are pressing for solution at this time. Happily, I have had the advantage of I the advice of the heads of several executive departments who have kept in close touch with affairs in their 4 detail, and whose thoughtful recom mendations I earnestly second. f "In the matter of the railroads and a the readjustment of their affairs grow- c nig out of federal control I shall take p the liberty of a later date of address- f ing you. ji "I hope that oongress will bring to a a conclusion, at this session, legisla- v tion looking to the establishment of t a budget system. That there should b .be one single authority responsible for the making of all appropriations, and tl that appropriations should be made not independently of each other, but 'with reference to one single compre hensive' plan of expenditure proper- ti ly related to the nation's income, there P han be no doubt. I believe the bur- d den of preparing the budget must, in a the nature of the case,i the work is a hto be properly doe sad resposlbllity yI *edsnaltat4 Istad at divtided, lest a he .iOnpati l The badge so ' i b 11askai;~tha aces-n made by the congress, except such as may have been included in the bud get prepared by the executive or add ed by the particular committee of con gress charged with budget legislation. "I trust that the congress will give its immediate consideration to the problem of future taxation. Simplifi cation of the income and profits taxes has become an immediate necessity. They must, however, be simplified, not only to save the taxpayers inconveni ence and expense, but in order that his liability may be made certain and definite. "With reference to the details of the revenue laws, the secretary of the treasury and the commissioner of in ternal revenue will lay before you for your cou',ideration certain amend ments necessary or desirable in con nection with the administration of the law recommendations which have my approval and support. "There are other matters of import ance upon which I urged action at the last session of congress which are still pressing for solution. I am sure it is not necessary for me to again remind you that there is one immediate and very practicable solution resulting from the war which we should meet in the most liberal spirit. It is a mat ter of recognition and relief to our soldiers. I can do no better than quote from my last message urging this very action: "We must see to it that our returning soldiers are as sisted in every practicable way to find the places for which they are fitted in the daily work of the country. This can be done by developing and main taining upon an adequate scale the ad mirable organization created by the department of labor for placing men seeking work and it can also be done in at least one very great field by cre ating new opportunities for indiivdual enterprise. "The secretary of the interior has pointed out the way by which return ing soldiers may be helped to find and take up land in the hitherto unde veloped regions of the country which the federal government has already prepared or can readily prepare for cultivation and also on many of the cutover or neglected areas which lie within the limits of the older states; and I once more take the liberty of recommending very urgently that his plans shall receive immediate and sub stantial support of congress. "No one who has observed - the march of events of the last year can fail to note the absolute need of a definite program to bring about an improvement in the condition of la a bor. There can be no settled condi r tions leading to increased production and a reduction in the cost of living if labor and capitjl are to be antago nistTc instead of partners. Sound thinking and an honest desire to serve the interests of the whole nation as I distinguished from the interests of a class must be applied to the solution S'of this great and pressing proble~ . The failure of other nationy to consid er this matter in a vigorous Way has produced bitterness and jealousies and antagonisms, the food of radicalis. The only way to keep men from agi tating against grievances is to remove the grievances. An unwillingness even today to discuss these matters produces only dissatisfaction and gives comfort to the extreme elements in our country which endeavor to stir up disturbances in order to provoke gov ernments to embark upon a course of retaliation and repression. The seed of revolution is repression. Thy rem edy for these things must not be nega tive in character. It must be con structive. It must comprehend the general interest. The real antidote for the unrest which manifests itself is not suppression, but a deep considera tion of the wrongs that beset our na tional life and the application of a remedy. "Congress has already shown its will ingness to deal with these industrial wrongs by establishing the eight-hour day as the standard in every field of labor. It has sought to find a way to prevent child labor. It has served thq whole country by leading the way idr developing the means of preserving and safeguarding the lives and health in dangerous industries. It must now help in the difficult task of finding a method that will bring about a genu ine democratization of industry, based upon the full recognition of the right of those *ho work in every rank to participate in some organic way in every decision which directly affects their welfare. It is with this pur pose in mind that I called a oonfer ence to meet in Washington on Decem ber 1 to consider these problems in all their broad aspects, with the idea of bringing about a better understand ipg between these two interests. "This is the hour of test and trial for America. By her prowess and strength and the indomitable courage of her soldiers she demonstrated her power to vindicate on foreign, battle fields her conceptions of liberty and justice. Let not her influence as a mediator between capital and labor be weakened and her own failure to set tle matters of purely domestic concern be proclaimed to the world. "There are those in this country who threaten direct action to force their will upon a majority. "Russia today, with its blood and terror, is a painful object lesson'of the power of minorities. It makes little difference what minority it is; wheth er capital or labor, or any other class; no sort of privilege will ever be per mitted to dominate this country.
