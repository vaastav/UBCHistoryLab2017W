Let us be frank and fair In Hub self examination, and not be afraid to make some few ad iuImIoqs that may not he entirely reprehensible. For It may be that we are alt striving for tho same thing, only in different ways, all more or less defective, and more or les successful or feeble as efforts. To get a cinch has always been the object of the world's de sire. It is no new thing. It Is ever reap peariug In new forms, not always recognized. It Is humanity's desire for a "sure thing," whether it Is presented by the gambler with load ed dice, or the corporation that, de signs and executes a grinding mon opoly against the people. It Is the sure thing we are alt after. We may as well acknowledge this. We are nil cornerers. To begin with the theologian and plttltt. His dream of conquest Is to make his calling and election sure, and in the world to come he hopes to get as near the inner ring of saints circling about the throne as possible. His first cinch is on the souls of men, which in days gone by he had the powtr to save or damn. The modern priest takes his sure thing in delighting to his utmst the flock he saves, jealously guarding them from coming in coutact with any spiritual information not of his own muke. Tho circle social is often the dream of woman's conquest. To have all society bow at her throne; to have no social enterprise succeed without hersaiKtlou;to have power, sureaud strong enough, to bend all others to her will; this sure thing is dearer to mauy a woman's heart than life itself, The political, busi ness and financial cinch are too corn on to merit remark. We are all too closely bound up jn such Jp wish ,to Those who have secured cluches nnd those who have not, but do most earnestly desire them, may well bo termed the favored and pre ferred of earth. To get one sure thing and keep it, and derive hon ors, influence, power, and reverence from it, Is certainly a cinch. But those who get these things are after nil a very small number. There are ninety-nine who have no such favors for oue who has. The tendency of so ciety Is to worship and defy this one. The world seems to others, less fortunate, to be pouring everything into their laps. Honors fame, riches flow to the man who has and seem to avoid the man who has not. The socialist says to the nluety-aud-nlue "behold the injustice of this thing. The oue revelleth in good things. He hath the earth to himself. We poor dumb cattle must stand out side the pasture bars and see him standing knee deep In clover." And there is some truth In It. The ciuch bus always existed. It may for all time. Slavery wsb a cinch. Royal ty Is a cinch. Aristocracy is u cluch. Mouopolies are clnohes legalized. Still every man can be a monopolist of virtues, good habits, economy, prudence, forethought. He may even monopolize the tongue In his head and absolutely coutiot it aud keep It from uttering a multitude of ftKillsh speeches. However, there are a vast num ber of peoplo In tho world who have no sure things, no "soft snapt," in short, no Interest to cinches. The men aud women who work at some honest and lawful labor or business, who support themselves by their own exertions, whether It be on the farm, in factory or shop, clerical or domestic service, whose labor goes to buy food, clothe? and build homes for families, all these people hare not the remotest relation to the sure things in many struggle for. They ask not to live by the toll of others, but ouly to be permitted to toil, They ask not to be allowed to gather profits earned by others, but ouly to profit by their own Industry and economy, They have the high est, yes n divine right not to be made the victim of cinches. Yet, we have ald the cinch Is what we are all after, everything said and done, De we not sometimes overlook those whs hnve not this cluch fever? They are certainly entitled to our respectful consideration. . I mm A MlraeU or IheMlnaUeath Century.

H.6 inrM. AciVovtatera Nvltial tUe lamruu Co , THE I.Ul'!tOVK.m".NT IN OlIK I'Ol.I TICS. The two greatest stales in tho Union by cenous are New York with fi,f07,8.r3 nnd Pennsylvania with rv 258,014 population. Oro of these states Is called doubtful In political parlance, the other Is solidly roptib Mean. New York can never be do pended upon for either ticket to a certainty. Pennsylvania can be re lied upon for frm tlfiy to one hun (I red thousand republican. In 1881 Now York, which gave Garfield ver twenty thousand phi lallty the year before, elected Cleve land governor by nearly two hun drrd thousand plurality. Jn 1884 thu same state could hardly be per suaded to give Cleveland it plurality for president. It did not in reality give him any plurality, If the votes of certain Inmates of public Institu tions since declared illegal liy' the supremo court are deducted. As It was he hnd a bare thousand votes where before he had the laigcst plu rality ever recorded, owing to the apathy of republicans who would not vote the Folger machine ticket. In 1888 the same state gave a more decided refusal of its political favors to Cleveland, giviug Harrison a sweeping victory, and throwing its favorite son overboard. While the state went republican on presiden tial electors, it elected Hill governor by an increased majority. Two yearn !ster the slate selects a demo cratic legislature who will tend the first United States senator of that party chosen sluce many years. In 1892 the state is liable to go republi can or democratic. Who can say with certainty what It will do? Turn for a moment to the keystone of the republican arch, Pennsyl vania, which this j ear chores a democratic governor. Against the chosen ticket of Senator Quay, chairman of the national republican ticket, rebellion arose in the rank and file of the party. If Senator Quay himself had been running, with all the prestige of his power and the patronage ot his party at his back or even the administration itself the result would not have been different. Ouly about every third voter in Penusylvaui.i Is not a republican. Nearly every other republican scratched his ticket. What is the lesson to be drawn from recent political history iu .these two states? Is it not the lesson ot a growth of personal Independence, oithodoxy? With either Hill or Cleveland running for the presi dency iu 1892, aud a republican ticket not acceptable to all republic ans, or even a good ticket with a Quay machine in charge of it, wlio can doubt the result ? Iu the newer states of the west party discipline is even more lax than In the older east ern states. The tide and volume of political independence is glowing stronger and party managers may well tremble. Is it not true that the successful appeal In politics to-day is uot made for party bo much as it is for the per sou of thb candidate, and the prin ciples he represents rather tlinu the platform he stands upou 9 With in creased verbosity and multiplication of planks In such structures, the life and acts ot the individual me be coming of more and muro impor tance. Platform promUes count less and candidates deeds more. The Individuality aud character of public men tiro what the intelligent aud independent voter seeks to place in the balance aud pass Judgment upou. We cannot see but that it Is an improvement In our politics. TUE COUNTltY UAH 

COMK TO IKKK Ml.VIUt. The farmers demaud It. All feigns point to it. We tiro to have a speedy enactment of a free silver coluoge law. Tho republicans Iu the lower houso of congress are eager aud prompt to take up the one thing for which the president's message contains no suggestion ot favor. The same house, whose leaders united with the president to prevent Us members coming to a direct vote ou the merits of a tree silver bill, seems now nuxious that this shall be the one measure that shall get before it. The passage of a half-way com promise, measure was ouly throwing a sop to Cerberus, a concession to the agricultural vole. It was a reluctant admission that the cur rency tyaa Inadequate, at a time whuu cousei vutisiit ou that point was fatal to the party Indulging It. The Farmers Alliance of the whole nation were petitioning for free silver, and the administration was afraid to face a few hundred con gressmen, upon an issue upon which It would have to fueo ten million votes. The readiness to take up a silver bill now, thu' not luvlted by tho Prtsldeut, shows that congressmen have heard from the people on tho subject. A free silver bill Is still a desirable law to secure, tho' It woud be as well now perhaps to try the op eration of the present law. Rut any law which leaves a large part of the bullion of the precious melals open to.kptoalfttlon Invites ninuetury dls turunnpes tliat lends to keep all bus un unbilled, VVhtt opposition Speaker Reed winnow, offer to free coinage ot sll 'ytr rwalas t be eo. Whether President Harrison will veto a free coinage bill Is ttnother topic for spec ulation. Perhaps they too have heard from the people. They inoy nut be altogether so solicitous for tho welfare of tho peoplo or the party as they are lor presidential possibilities In the future. And what will the Alliance votes do vlth Hon. Grover Cleveland, whose pronounced aiill sllver views liuve not undergone any change that tin public are aware of? He may bo wlso enough to see that free silver coinage Is not any longer a problem. The country has come to It already. It was tho power be hind the ground swell of 1890. If It is again donled It will rend the po litical earth in 1892 and seat a free silver farmer in the White House. Corrected Census) Figures. Washington, Nov. 27.
