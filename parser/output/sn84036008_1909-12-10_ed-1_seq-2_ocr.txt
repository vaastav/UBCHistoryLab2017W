In effect the message as it went to the two houses of the national legislature yesterday, had been dis counted by the public utterances of Mr. Taft upon his long swing around the circle. One of the matters in which the people were very much interested and upon which they desired to obtain the views of the president was the sug gested changes in the interstate commerce act. This is one of the matters which the president prom ises to treat later. Another matter was the re ported suggestion o'f changes in the Sherman anti trust act, peculiar significance being attached to this because of the recent decision against the Standard Oil company. Again the desires of the public for information concerning the views of the executive, together with a possible line upon what congress will do in the matter, were disappointed for it will require a special message to enlighten the public. One of the matters which will interest the public is the portion of the message regarding the estab lishment of a system of postal savings banks. It had been underst)od possibly through the intima tion given out by Mr. Taft, that nothing in rela tion to the reform of the monetary system of the country could be expected at the present session of congress because of the fact that the commis sion which had been selected to investigate the mat ter had not progressed sufficiently with its work to be able to render a report. From this the pre sumption naturally arose that without it being definitely known just what sort of a system would be established or how far the proposed reforms of our financial system would go there would be nothing done in the way of the establishment of postal banks. In discussing this, the president holds that there would be nothing in the operation of postal sav ings banks which in any degree would bring them .iuto competition with existing banking institutions and that therefore there was no reason why such banks should not be established even though our monetary and financial systems should be given a material modification. Just what it is proposed to do with the moneys deposited in such banks is not clear from the message, the president refrain ing from suggestion, although it is known that Mbr. Taft believes that it might be wise to use the fund, so secured for taking up the low-priced bonds which, because of the fact that they draw less, in Lerest than can be secured in the ordinary run of business are a drug upon the market. The situation in China is treated in a highly diplomatic and thoroughly satisfactory manner in the message and it is probable that but little in re lation to American claims in the Orient will de velop in the proceedings of congress. The reco:m mendations for sweeping changes in the navy de partment whereby the power of the bureaus will be materially curtailed, is in full support of the recommendations of Secretary Meyer previously published and commented upon in thee columns. Our foreign relations, with the exception of those` with Nicaragua are as usual, decidedly satisfactory. The president in relation to the Central Americanl republic, calls attention to the fact that diplomatic relations have been broken off and with this, the whole matter is passed up to congress. In the matter of conservation, the president is exceedingly brief while in the matter of questions of authority between the interior department and the forestry service of the department of agricul ture the president is wisely silent. It is promised that this matter will be treated in a special message which may be expected soon. It is not to be expected that all of the matters upon which the people are thinking could be treated in this message which otherwise would have caused the document to be unduly bulky. As the session progresses other messages will be sent in and it may be taken for granted that within the ntear future the public will be completely taken into thie confidence of the chief executive.

What K.nox said about Zelaya was plenty. What 7elaya said about Knox was too hot to come over the wires. . J Mexico Displays Wisdom It is the part of wisdom for the government of Mexico to decline to take sides in the controversy between the United States and Nicaragua or to commit itself as between the two warring factions of the Central American republic, but for all that there is no question that the republic to the south of us, would be highly pleased ,were Uncle Sam to roundly spank Zelaya and thus restore peace to the Isthmian region. Mexico occupies a peculiar relation to the gov ernments of Central America. Because of its size and importance, all of the little republics credit the Diaz government with a desire to force a great Central American federation with Mexico as the dominant factor, and naturally each of the little states sees in every act of the Mexivan government an ulterior purpose. On the other hand, a Latin American nation like Mexico is not altogether free from possibilities of revolution, and to side with the insurrectionists of Nicaragua against the con stituted government, even though the latter may have violated all the rules of decency. would place Mexico in a position where she could not well re sent breaches of neutrality in the event that her neighbors should see fit to assist in her own insur rection. Mexico and the United States, through the Wash ington convention, were charged with the keeping of the peace of the hemisphere and according to the letter of that convention, Mexico could well actively interfere in the affairs of Nicaragua. but actually it would be a dangerous precedent should she attempt such a thing. This is recognized by the state department and there is little probability that Mexico will be called upon to assume anything but a passive part, at, least until matters have so shaped up that the simple good offices of the Diaz government will suffice. If there is any trouncing to be done, Uncle Sam will wield the whip , the execution of two Ameri cans furnishing the pretext, and after this is prop erly attended to, then Mexico may step in with good advice which will allay the wounded spirits of the Central Americans. Value of Sugar Beet Crop While we are w1orking to bring new agricultural and manufacturing enterprises to Billings, -we are prone to overlook the greatest manufacturing in dustry we have. We have a sugar factory which we are told can take care of about four times as many beets as are at present raised in the Yellowstone valley. or twice as many beets as are raised naw in Yellow stone and Carbon counties. The Billings Sugar company can be brought by proper encouragement to pay $900,000 for beets to the farmers of this county instead of $250,000. The balance of the present payment of over $500,000 this year is paid to the farmers of Carbon county, and more distant territories. Further, the factory by running six weeks longer as it would like to run, would pay out for labor about $100,000 more than it is paying now with insufficient acreage. The acreage for the factory has increased grad unlly every year since the start., but they have kept sptreading out over wider territory. Our farmers are becoming better satisfied with their results each year as they grow more proficient in knowl edge of beet raising. Let us all boost for a longer campaign at the factory and a bigger beet check in Yellowstone county next year. VWhile there might be some question of how the people regard the constructicn of the wings of the state house out of Indiana limestone, there surely is no doubt of the pleasure being experienced by the dry farmers of eastern Montana because of the period of snow and rain which is visiting us. Look for bumper ' heat crop' in the Northwest next year. The nations building battleships should likewise have large bank accounts.

PROTECTIVE TARIFF IS A BRITISH POSSIBILITY Unionists Propose Great Change in Eco nomic Condition of England in Order to Raise Revenue LONDON, Dec. 7.-The Birmingham Daily Post tomorrow will publish an article from inspired sources outlining the tariff reform proposals that are likely to be made by the unionist government if the unionists are successful at the elections, pre facing it with the remarks that the country's financial necessities are much greater than they were in 1906, when Joseph Chamberlain started the movement. The article continues: "It is proposed to establish a gen eral tariff, placing duties on practical ly all goods that are not deemed of raw material, with the object, irst, of raising revenues; secondly, of as sisting the home producers against foreign competition; third, of giving preference to the colonies; fourth, of securing better terms from foreign countries, and ffth, of mitigating un employment by encouraging the home producer. "The tariff will be of the simplest possible form, not protective in the sense that it is understood in Germany and the United States. There is no intention of having m~ultifarious rates whch would throw open the door to parliamentary intrigues. The plan is Unprecedented Weather Throughout the Country Kansas May Proceed Against Gas Company to Protect Fuel Sup ply---Frozcn to Death 'ANSAS CIT'Y, Dec. 8.-After twol days of temperature ranging as low as zero and no higher than 10 degrees above, the southwest has no promise of relief from the gov ernment forecaster tonight.

IAtRAMIE, Wyo., Dec. 8.-A special Alderman Sylvester Tenders Resignation Reconsideration of Action of Coun cil in Revoking Saloon License Cause of His Action From Wednesday's Daily. J IA ITII reference to my action tonight in resigning as a 'Ie couu c1 beg . submit the following: "Since I became connected with the present administration I have endeav ored by my acts to represent the tax payers and citlzens in a manner satis factory to them. For the preservation of public morals I offered a resolu tion some time ego whereby a saloon license should be revoked, whenever a conviction was obtained, by trial, or a plea of guilty, of either a city ordi nance or state law. This resolution was adopted by the council. At the last meeting of the council I moved for a revocation of the license of Anton Becker, who pleaded guilty to two charges of a violation of the wineroom law, at the last session of court here and ,was fined $100 in each case. The motion was carried and I took it for granted that the orders of the council would .be carried out by the police de partment. A couple of days ago I asked the chief of police if the Becker place was closed and he stated that it was not; that he .had been told by the mayor to hold off as the action of the council would probably be rescinded. In conversation with the mayor I gathered that he was not in favor of revoking the license. I told him then that if dt was going to be the policy of the administration to allow them selves to be run by the saloon element of the town, that I would not be fur ther connected with such an adminis tration. That if the rule providing for revocation of license was a goon one. it should be applied without fear or favor. to allow raw materials duty free to impose a five per cent duty on partly manufactured goods, ten per cent on articles nearly completed, and 15 per cent on completely manufactured goods. There will be no variations in this scale, unless in exceptional cases. There may possible, be, however, a slightly lower duty in favor of the colonies and a slightly higher tariff against countries seeking unduly to penalize British goods. "'oreign wheat will be liable to a duty of two shillings per quarter, with preference to the colonies, but not the removal of the whole duty. "Flour will pay a higher rate to encourage home grinding, while bacon and maize will also be excluded from the rree list. Important raw mna terials, such as cotton and wool, will enter free. "A tariff framed thus, it is estirma ted, would produce a revenue of from sixteen to twenty million pounds. If the unionists are returned, every pos sible effort will be made to embody the new duties in the budget of 1910, or at the latest in 1911, 'but the maxl mum duties will be withheld for two years to give time to negotiate com mercial agreements with foreign coun tries." to the Republican from Hanna, 76 miles west of here, says that the driver of a stage between Hanna and Leo. and his only passenger were found frozen to death on the road.

NORFOLK. Neb., Dec. 8.-North Nebraska, southern and western South Dakota and Northern Wyoming today suffered from the coldest weath er of the winter. The temperature in Norfolk dropped to 12 below zero; at Deadwood it was 17 below, and at Lander it was 20 below. Cold Wave Continues. SIOUX CITY, Iowa, Dec. 8.-The cold wave continues in this section to day. It was 8 below zero at 7 o'clock this morning. "I have given a great deal of my time to the city's -business and have, endeavored to help run the public 'business on -business principles, and I regret the necessity for taking this stop, but as stated before, I do not wish to be connected with an admin istration that allows itself to .be dom inated by the saloon element and I realize it would be a losing fight to continue." Following the action of the city council taken at its meeting last night in regard to the reconsideration of the motion to annual the saloon franchise of Antone Becker, Alderman W. F. Sylvester of the Second ward tendered his resignation as a member of the council to take effect Immediately, and as the reason for his action the above statement. Mr. Sylvester's action came as a complete surprise to the members of the council and followed a stormy de bate and the carrying of the motion for the reconsideration of the previous motion by a vote of 5 to 3. i The action on whioh Mr. Sylvester 'based his grounds for resignation was the attitude taken by the council in regard to the revoking of the licenses of saloon men who have been convict ed of violating the laws. Three weeks ago following the con viction of Antone Becker, proprietor of a Minnesota avenue saloon, for the violation of the state and wineroom laws, Mr. Sylvester introduced a mo tion in the council providing for the revoking of the Becker license. Al derman Frith seconded the motion of Alderman Sylvester and the license was ordered revoked. In spite of this hact the saloon, it is said, has been in operation since the motion was car rled three weeks ago. Last evening Alderman Frith stated that he had been led to change his opinion in regard to the justice of the revoking of the Becker ldcense, and therefore entered a motion for the re consideration of the question. He was seconded by Alderman Hood. Alderman Wooda declared that the question was not the justice or the in justice of the revoking of the Becker license but one of upholding or setting at naught the previous actions of the council and the policy which had been laid down in the matter, and declared that he would vote against the recon sideration of the question. When the matter came to a vote Al dermen Hood, Frith, Terrell, Niteohe and Thorsen voted for a reconsidera tion while Aldermen Sylvester Smith and Woods opposed it. The vote on a motion to all~ow the Becker license to continue in force was carried in the same manner with the same five al dermen voting for it and with Sylvesa ter, Smith and Woods opposing it. Mayor Thompson Has Answer to Sylvester From Thursday's Daily. IN AN interview with Mayor H. J. Thompson relative to the resigna tion of Alderman W. F. Sylvester of the Second ward at the council meeting on Tuesday night, Mayor Thompson made the following state ment: "The council and myself feel in the resignation of Alderman Sylvester that the city has been deprived of the services of a faithful and efficient alderman. "Regarding a resolution that every saloonkeeper violating a city ordi nance or state law would have his liquor license revoked, which Alder man Sylvester stated he had intro duced some months ago and which, he declares, was unanimously carried, I want to say, on the authority of the city clerk, that no such resolution was ever introduced or adopted. The Becker saloon was not closed on the authority of the vote taken by the council on Nov. 16, for the reason that the city attorney advised that the proceedings of the council in that par ticular case were irregular and sub ject to legal objections. "Concerning the charge that this present council was controlled by the saloon element, I will say that the knowledge covering this fact can hardly be gauged by the opinion of ;one man, as the records of the coun cil are open to the public to judge for themselves, and it may be pertinent to mention here that the last business transacted by the council previous to this charge being made was the adop tion of an ordinance restricting the saloons to the certain district in which they are now situated, to prevent their further extension in to the resi dence district. "In view of the .ircumstances it seems necessary that these corrections be made."

NORTHo INVEST ENT COMPANY Opposite Court House Billings, Montana RELIEVING SUFFERERS President Appeals for Assistance to the Red Cross HONORS TOx TAFT Amerleam Bed teess leets Hm as President--In Inaugural He Tells of Great Work Performed and Asks for Permanent Foundation Throgh. the Generosity of the Pablie. WASHFNGTON, Dec. 7.-President Taft was elected president of the American Red Cross today and presided for a time over the fifth annual metting of the association. The president made a brief address, in which he expressed the hope that someone might present the Red Cross with an endowment of $5,000,000 to place its beneficient work on a more permanent basis. Mr. Taft also pre sented in person a gold medal voted by the Red Cross to Lloyd C. Grisoom. former Ambassador to Italy for his work at the Messina earthquake and silver medals to Miss Katherine B. Davis and Samuel L. Parrish, who as sisted in the Italian relief work. Among other officers re-elected were Henry M. Hoyt, editor of the Red Cross Society; Robert W. DeFor est, vice president, and Beekman Win throp, treasurer. The hall where the meeting was held this afternoon was only partly filled when President Taft arose to speak. "These meetings." he said, "do not seem to grow in numbers and they do not by any means represent the growth and usefulness of this organ ization and the demonstration that it has made from time to time each year of the necessity for its continued life and of the need of a permanent foun dation that shall make it one of the greatest American institutions. "Last year the society showed what it could do in its assistance to Italy after the earthquake, in Mexico after floods, and in eastern Persia after the massacres. It seems necessary to fill the American eye and American ear before you can arouse them to con tributions, and when you have a dis aster such as that in Italy, which ap pealed to all, we are most generous. "And so it is with respect to the Christmas stamp. That seems to fill the eye of the public and its connec tion with tuberculosis carries a good revenue with it. But when it comes to the contribution of a dollar a year, when it comes to increased member ship, and when it comes to the es tablishment by those substantial con tributions of a large endowment fund. the matter moves slowly. "I am sure somebody is going to be born, and I hope he is born already. who will give us a large endowment. In our imaginations we might as well make it as large as we need. I think we ought to have an endowment of about $5,000,000. We have been mod est and have asked for only $2,000,000. but if anyone has an extra $3,000,000 he need not be restricted by the limi tation put in and caused by our mod esty." 4,, ****** 4, *
