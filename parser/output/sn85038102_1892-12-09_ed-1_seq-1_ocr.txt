Washington, Dec. 7. The present pros perity of the country, according to the president's message, is unequalled, and census statistics are quoted liberally to show the growth of business in thirty years. Tin plate factories now number thirty-two. Our foreign trade in 1892 showed an Increase of 27 per cent., wholly due to exports. Everything is better than ever before, except that wheat and cotton are low, but discontented farmers should remember they are better off than the farm ers of any other country. Protection has been a mighty instrument in the develop ment of our wealth and the prevention of waoA The result of the recent election must be accepted as having introduced a new policy. He assumes that the present tariff is to be repealed, and that there is to be substituted for it a tariff law con structed solely with reference to revenue; that no duty is to be liiguer because the increase will keep open au American mill, or keep up the wtiaes of American work ingman. The contention has not been between schedules, but between principles, and it would be offensive to suggest that the prevailing party will not carry into legis lation the principles advocated by it, and the pledges given to the people. He rec ommends that the whole subject of tariff revision be left to the incoming congress, although regretting that this must delay the work of revision at least three months. He is skeptical relative to the future tinder a changed tariff, and the protec tionists, with undiminished confidence, will await results. The benefits of protec tion to woikingmen have been obscured by the contests between employers and employes. 'I he net decrease in revenue during the year was J.Ii,O0O,O0O, but it is estimated there will lie a cash balance of J20.000.0HO in tlut treasury at the and of the tUuul year. It is impossible.however, to foresee with certainty whether the revenues will not be further diminished by the prospect of tariff changes. He says the surplus is not in the treasury any more, but in the pockets of the people, by means of the. pension legislation and free sugar. He recommen'ls repeal of sinking fund law, and withholds any suggestions relative to silver because the monetary congress is in session. We have no more Indian frontiers, and the policy of concentration should now be adopted in distributing the army. lie tninKs some better methods of deal ing with claims presented to the court of claims should be adopted, and supports the postal suosidy idea and urges a con tinuance .of the present policy. The new navy is glowingly described. He recom mends a further encouragement of the naval militia. The service at the Indian agencies has bieu improved. He approves of the present at! ministration of the pension bureau, and says there is a pension de ficiency this year of $10,500,000. If no further pension legislation is enacted, the maximum of pension payments will be reached in two years, and will aggregate 118,000,000 a year. ljj complements Secretary Rusk on the enlarged foreign markets for pork and beef. Unreasonable and unfriendly objections from Canada have thwarted our negotia tions with England relative to the seals, the fisheries and canal tolls. Canadian railroadsare sustained by American trade, and it is estimated that these foreign transportation lines yearly carry between different points in the United States goods to the value of $100,000,000. We have no disposition to interfere with the politics of Canada, but we should put the transportation business upon a different foundation and build an American canal around Niagara Falls to secure our independence of Canadian 1 waterways. He extends congratulations on the happy conclusion of Chilian misunder standing. Believes in promoting a cable to the Sandwich Islands and says the government should support the Nicara gua canal project The free coinage of silver upon an agreei international ratio is desirable, and the business demand is growing for an enlargement of the world's volume of coined money. The work of reciprocity has been well begun, and under favorable conditions we hall soon net fully one-third of the Cen tral and South Atuerican trade; Europe is already alarmed by the new policy of this government. - The twenty-day quarantine will be con tinued. Epidemics can be avoided, and immigration suould be restricted. The liquor traffic in Washington should be restricted. . Fatal car couplers are condemned. He has under consideration a further extension of the civil service system. He appeals for a patriotic and non-partisan consideration of electoral reform and deprecates southern lawlessness. He has pointed out our present prosper ity that we may better note the increase, or decrease which will ensue from the new tariff policy, and says "Retrogression would be a crime."
