There li.ve burn great characters among (logs, as among men, who have given a redeeming reputation to the whole race. There are certain breeds of dog. which, like certain breeds of African negroes, are distinguished by honesty and loyally. There are some of them who rise to I tie quality of heroes and public benefac tors. such as the dogs of ,St. B.ruaid, whom, if we had the powers of the keys, should cer tainly he adltiilted to Heaven ; and New foundland dogs, noble, beautiful creatures, who spring into the water and save a valua ble life, and shake themselves drr when they come out with the air of one who would say, in reply to all the praises they receive: •• Pray don't mention it —no incovenience whatever—just a little dampness, which will be ove-r iii a moment.'' Uni we are sorry to believe that the roman tic interest which in consequence of such cases attaches to dogs in general, is not mer ited hy the* w hole race. We have seen a dog. and we dare say many of our readers have, w ho conduct! (! himself with a degree of levity in a place of public worship -.list would have disgusted the devout dog of the Eitrick Shepherd. Who has nut seen one of these four-footed villiains come in during an admi lablr discount, as iftlie devil had hired him to divert the thoughts of the congrega tion from whai might otherwise have been ol benefit to their understandings and their hearts ? To see this dog moving up and down I he- a Isles, as if he were in quest of somebody whom he could never find, and looking in at I lit- open doors of pews as if he wanted to ask the people if they had seen anything of his master, now and then varying the peiformanees by pesiiculating violently in front of the pulpit with his tail, and repeat ing these performances till thalcurious being, limn, who has a mind to comprehend thoughts that interest the angels, is unable to fix Ins attention on these thoughts, and comes down as by an irresistible giaviintion from the Contemplation of the- vast arch of eter nity and all ils shining bus's, in (hat mis erable- four-footed wretch. All this is enough to make one nndersiaod, in a literal sense, the ApnseU-’s warning; Iltitare of dogs." And then the perfect impunity with which he insults the congregation and annoys the min ister. every one- knowing that it is better to submit to his impertinence than by at tempting to expel him, possifly to hare n dog liglu in the chuich. .Sometimes we have seen an effort, made in all Christian charily and courtesy, locoax and wheedle a dog out of a sanctuary, and this is the only kind ul treatment we would ever recommend. If you can make him believe that there is somebody out of doors whom he can annoy more than he is annoying those inside, he will be sure io go. But, w hether the manner in which he w hines and scratches for admission af er wards, and the vneiferousness wnh wnich he harks whenever the speaker raises his Voice, arc not as had as his silent devotions in the U-rnple, we do not pretend to decide. We have seen slump speakers in our time almost silenced hy the voice of the four-footed ora tor in a neighboring yard, who would bark so Vociferously whenever they would raise their voices that they were compelled to •• rout " their audiences " gently,” and, if they forgot themselves for a moment, and soared into the high latitudes of sound and sentiment, up rose the most furious ejaculations from the ilI-inaniß-red riv'., who had no idea of being governed by the parliamentary rule of •• one at a time.” We have referred above to the dog of the Ettrick Shepherd, a dug Whose conduct in church was most exemplary.- What a pic ture the Shepherd draws of firm : "It's a glide sign o’ a dowg. sir, wherthisf.ee grows like his master's.

American. Curiosities of .Names. The N. Y., Methodist, which by the way, we regard as one of the most e xccl lent of family papers, contained, recently, the following interesting notice of a work, en titled Concerning some Scotch Surnames, from the pen of Mr. Cosmo [ones. Professor of History in the Univcisity of Edinburgh. This book, among other things, shows how curiously names are changed in Course of time, so that if the archaeologist and uiniqna ri >n did not hunt up the connection no one would suspect them to he the same. Who would suspect that Sliggliis, the gin-drinking •• Shepherd " of the Pickwick papers, was a descendant ofStiganders, the great Norman primate ? or that the humble Tibbetts was km to the grand Theobald ?or that the de scendanisuf Ingulphus have corrupted that stalely name to the vulgar Gunter? Tnreol is from Thoroughgnod; Terry from Thcodoric; and Toby from St. Olnve. 'I hat there is a good deni in a name lias been the opinion of very many people, or we should not have so many George Washington Smiths and Napoli on Bonaparie Joneses in the Directory. A good name is a very desirable filing, but John seems to us the best of all Almost every man has some time tried the sii'iiij’ of his name, to sec how easily it fit in the popular mouth, and how musically it would read in the laudations of newspapers. But fortune is impartial, and takes no ac count of popular convenience when she names her favorites. Could any name have sounded more awkwardly at first, and more unlike a . name destined to fume, than that of Napo leon Bonaparte? And yet it hid one important point in ils favor; it ended in on; and it is noticeable that the gieat majority of iho gn at names, ai least in modern history, have that termina tion. Call e,H" at hazard; there were Wash ington, Napoleon. Wellington, Nelson. Mil ton. Clinton. Madison, Jefferson. Bacon Addison, Newton, and so on. Any one can recall them hy ;he dozen. In the Presiden tial canvass just closed, a shrewd calculator of chances remarked that of ihe four candi dates hot one owned a name which sounded as though it terminated in on. and the light this gave * decided advantage to Mr. Lincoln, whose name he persistently pronounced Lmcun. Of the changes which time has made in the spelling and pronunciation of names. p n ,f es . sor Inne-s gives some very curious examples. I l.e splendid De linllasizc has been corrupted to Hetscher ; ,Tnr. a common Scotch name, is fioin [)c V ere : Mown! is from De Montcul to. St. Mb nr is changed to Seymour; South well, Snell ; S.

Ihe great majority of family names have a meaning, and in some wav explain the ori gin of the family. This is even more the case with German names than with English, though it would puzzle one to throw light on the oiigin of the name of one of Germany’s most homm-d living theologians, Karl Fred rich Ledeihosen, which being literally trans lated, is as much as lossy Chuiles I-'iederiek Lealherhreeclu-s.

Being ready to leave, and bearing Dial his craft was to re turn to New York, I repaired on board and inquired (or Mr. Fulton.

I think six dohurs, was named. The amount, in coin I laid in his open hand, and with his rye fixed upon it he remained so long motionless that 1 supposed there might be- a miscount, and said to him, •is Dial, right sir?’ This roused him as from a reverie, and as he look ed up at me the lug tear was brimming in his eye. and his voice faltered as he said, • Ex cuse me sir; bm memory was busy as I con templated tins, the first pecuniary reward I have ever received for all my exertions in adapting steam la navigation.

ELSTON, MARYLAND. SITURDAI HORNING, DECEMBER 15, 1860. Political. The President’s Message. The National Intelligencer, with its usual acumen , thus refers to portions of the late i Message of President Buchanan. I Commencing with an allusion to the nncx : ampled prosperity of our land in all its rnate j rial interests, he immediately proceeds to remark on the public discontents and appre hensions which threaten with destruction that Union of the States so justly recognized by him as the source of all the civil blessings we are now enjoying. These discontents are traced by the President to “ a long continued and intemperate interference ot the Northern people with the question of slavery in the Southern States.” Under this head the Mes sage will probably strike our readers as b ing remarkable more for its omissions than even i tor the breadth or generality of its state ments, as no allusion whatever is made in it to the historical fact that the *• long-contin ued and intemperate” agitation of the slavery question had come to an almost total end at the North after the adoption of the compromise measures of 18>0, and if a few years later the unhappy controversy was again revived, it did not take the form ut political ! interference with the question of slavery in j the Southern State*, but was, as all know, di ! reeled to the question in its Territorial rela tions. The observations of the President in refu tation of the theory which proposes to make tlie Constitutional election of a President a cause for disunion arc so sell-evident ly just and proper that they will commend them selves to the approval of all, requiring as they do, nothing more than their simple statement to carry with them the force of unanswerable argument. Equally true are the remarks he makes respecting the limited range of the Ex ecutive ollicc, and the conservative character which must necessarily be impressed on any ! incumbent of the Presidential chair “ by the very nature of that oflice.” It seems to have been the patriotic purpose of the President in these remarks to show how chimerical, and at the same time, how alien to the true theory ol our Constitutional Government, arc any appro hensi ms derived or pretending to be derived from this source; and, as if to give additional force to this consideration, (and perhaps de siring intentionally to modify the generality of his remarks In referring to the long-con tinued agitation of the slavery question,) the President proceeds under this head to say that * no single act has passed Congress, mi. less we may possibly except the Missouri compromise, impaling in the slightest degree the rights of the South to their property in slaves.” If this be so, it will be apparent that the intemperate agitation, so justly deplored by the President, lias been very remarkable for its impotence, since the only aggressive act, proceeding from the Federal Government, of ' which the South his reason to complain, ac- ( acordingto this statement, was committed long before that agitation, in its modern phase was begun, while history records that it was main ly committed by Southern men, and demand ed by them anew in the year 18*30. It may strike some minds as not a little singular that the restriction of slavery contained in be leg islation of 18.0 should be singled out for con demnation, when the same principle, as ex emplified in the Oregon bill signed by Presi dent Polk while Mr. Been aa an was Secre tary of Slate, is wholly ignored as a cause of complaint. We know that distinguished Democrats participated in the latter transac tion; but this fact surely can give no dilfer enl complexion to the m -r.il quality or con stitutional bearings of the question involved iu the Territorial prohibition ofslavery. Tiik Advantagbs of Disunion*. —And if! the recollection of common dangers, in which these people of the United Stales stood side by side against the common foe— the memo ry of victories won by their united valor: the prosperity and happiness they have enjoyed under the present constitution: tl.e pioud name they bear as citizens of this great repub lic—if all these recollections and proofs of common interest are not strong enough to bind us together as one people, what *ie will bold united the new division of empire w hen these bonds have been broken and the Union dissolved i The first line of separation would not last for a single generation, new fragments would be torn off; new leaders would spring op. and ibis great and glorious republic would soon be broken into a multi tude of petty Stales, without commerce, without credit ; jealous of one another: armed for mutual aggressions : loaded with taxes to pay armies and leaders; seeking aid against each oilier from foreign powers ; insulted and trampled upon by the nationsof Europe until, h*.missed with conflicts, nod bumbled ami debased in spirit, they would be ready to sub mit to absolute dominion of any mill it ar v adventurer, and to surrender their liberty fur the sake of repose. It is impossible to look on the consequences that would inevitably follow the destruction of this government, and not feel indignant when we bear cold calcula tions about the value of the Union, and have so constantly before us a line of conduct so well calculated to weaken its ties. —An ear trod from the Farewell Address of Andrew Jackson.

The wicked have triumphed—all the slaves are to be liberated iails will be at a premium slavery is to be abolished on the sib of March—while men will take back seats and tho rail splitter—Oh, we forgot—Mr. Lincoln will preside over the destinies of this country. NVe have met the enemy, and we are theirs. ” B.* merciful to us poor sinners.” We went in like lions and came out like lambs. •• Oh treat us not revengefully ! n We intended to scoop them out and they scooped us. ** The people that wulktd in darkness have seen a great light.” We guess it was the Wide Awakes! We valiantly marched up the hill-- and we can run down again ! •* Come my be loved. let us go forth into the fields. 11 We should have beaten them if they had not beaten us. *• Oh bow our people ere bent on backsliding !” We cannot but think that James Buchanan and his crew have been the means of defeating tl.e Democratic party, and little is the politi cal respect we have for them If Democracy is dead, Buchanan has killed it. But one tiling is certain—not only ourself but thous ands of Democrats—men who never bow to power, intend to sit up with the corpse, and in 1804 be on band at the resurrection. We cun stand it as well as our neighbors for four years, and the pot may boil.
