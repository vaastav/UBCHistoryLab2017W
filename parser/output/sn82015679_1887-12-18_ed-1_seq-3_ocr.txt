The Attitude of the Republicans ani Men Who Stand ivith Mr. Randall. toc!l to the Iadianaoli Journal. Washington, Deo. 17. If there is any tariff reform by this Congress there will be internal tax reform. While quite a number of Repub licans in the House are in favor of a moderate reduction of the tariff on unmanufactured articles, they at the same time demand reduction of the tax on tobacco and domestic distillations. It is safe to predict that m bill making a total red notion of the government income to an segregate of about $40,000,000 or $50,000,000 could paes the House by compromise among Republicans and Randall Democrats; but these men will demand that cot only the plain necessaries of life be affected, but that the internal taxes be reduced, and there is no nse of talking about a compromise. A bill which makes a reduction of say $40,000,000 will hare to affect the customs dues in about the same proportion as it does internal taxes. The Republicans and tariff-protection Democrats will not consent to any wholesale reform like that propoced by Mr. Mills, of Texas, who is to be chairman of the House committee on ways and means. In the Senate I could name a number of Dem ocrats who will not vote for a bill reducing the customs dues and not tcuchinp the internal taxes. The Republicans in that body stand in about the same attitude toward the tariff pro tection that those in the House do. Many of tne aoutbern benators are as anxious for a re duction of the Internal taxes as they are for a reduction of the customs dues, and they know if the latter is affected to any considerable deeree without touching the former that the internal taxes will be permitted to stand for many years, and the internal taxes are really more burdensome to the peoDle of the South than the free-traders find the im port dues, because they- use a great deal of to bacco, while they patronize the imports to a much less extent than the people of the North. Besides this, they are striving to build up their fruit brandy and wine industry, and these would be stimulated by the abolition of the internal taxes imposed upon tbem. Local interests were never brought forward to a greater extent in the consideration of tariff and internal taxes than at present, and every man intends to look out fpr his own district's interest in whatever he does. GENERAL DADEAU'8 LETTER. The President's Mnic and the Queen's Speech Grant's First Meuaca to Congress. Correspondence of the Indianapolis Jocrnafr Washington, Iecv13. The night after tbe President's message was delivered to Congress there chanced to be nearly a dozen Senators dining at the same house, and three of these bad been Cabinet ministers. Two others of the party bad been Assistant Secretaries of State, two secretaries to a President, and there were be sides, at table, various members of tbe English and Canadian governments. The company was very busy making opinion and comparing ex periences. The Americans had assisted at either the preparation or the delivery of mes sages innumerable, and at least one of the Englishmen had been present at tbe concoction of speeches from tbe throne, for be bad served both in Tory and Liberal Cabinets. The conver sation suggested very vividly the difference be tween the English and the American methods of government. There is, indeed, hardly a point that illus trates mors sharply the contrast between oar institutions and tbe English the reality that prevails in our politics and the shams that still exist in theirs; the simple, rugged power that ia a republic one man may wield and the weakness that in a monarchy is covered up by pomp and paraphernalia than the fashion in which the bead of the state addresses tha representatives of the nation. The message of the President is sent to Congress by a private secretary, in plain morning clothes, who annonnces his errand and departs, after which the document is read aloul by the proper officer with no more formality than any other paper receives. The speech of the Queen of England is delivered either by ber Majesty in person from the throne, clad in her royal robes, and surrounded by the highest o Cheers of state, or it is read for ber by the Lord Chancellor in his ermine and antiquated gauds, and amid elaborate ceremonies. Each ia an important document of stafe, and often announces tbe intentions of the govern ment, or appeals to the party that sustains the government, or to the whole people of the country. But the President, if he chooses, is the sole author of his message, while the SDeecb is invariably written for the Queen. The Prime Minister decides what shall be tbe language and doctrine of the sovereign's utterance. He, in deed, submits the draft to ber Majesty as a mat ter of form, but bis will, not hers, is paramount when they differ; and if Victoria does some times procure a modification of the expressions, or, possibly, in rare instances, of the opinions that go forth as ber own, she must argue with ber Minister, and convince him first, just as here a minister must argue with the President if he wishes to affect his views. The English speech is usually the production of tbe Prime Minister, but it is read in Cabinet, where suggestions are admissable; though in tbe days of such autocrats as Beaconsfield or Glad stone, the Premier laid down the poiicy and his colleagues submitted or resigned: they rarely changed the determination of tbe chief when it was already formed. After the Cabinet has bad its say not its way tbe paper is taken to the Queen, who, except in unusual circumstances, accepts it as it is offered. There have been times when Majesty pleaded hard for a change, but was obliged to yield, even, it is said, in tears for Majesty bas very decided views ia politics; but if tbe Minister is firm there is no alternative, except to dismiss tbe Minister. And to dismiss a Minister with a large majority at bis back is an impossibility now-a-days for an English sovereign; it might mean revolution, and Majesty prefers the throne to the speech from tbe throne. Of late the Queen has seldom delivered ber speech in person, though in her earlier years she used to read it with rhetorical effect. She bas opened Parliament only once or twice since the death of the Prince Consort, and then always when tbe Tories have been in power, to indicate her sympathy. Bat ereu when she bas gone thus far she remains silent on the throne, and the Lord Chancellor reads the speech for her; so that much of the interest bl tne ceremony is lost. But the English are as anxious to know the contents of the speech as-Americana to learn in advance what the message will declare; and on the night before Parliament is opened there is usually a great dinner at the Premier's hous. and afterward a general reception, to which all tbe important people of his own party, and often a few of the other, are asked, and to these the speech is read before it is delivered. Sometimes it is even printed in a favored newspaper before it is heard in Parliament. Presidents, of late years, bas been more reti cent than this, and not made knorn beforehand what they meant to say, even to their close ad herents, much less to the world at large. They usually, however, consult their Cabinets and take summaries from each minister of what be wishes embodied in the message, while the Sec retary of State, who holds a position narer that of the English Premier than any of bis col leagues, bas often much to do with the making or construction of the measaee. The portion re lating to foreign affairs is sometimes written out entirely in the State Department, and ac cepted by the President withoat a change. When C-sneral Grant wrote bis first message to Congress I was on duty at the White House, and he showed tne ti document before sub mitting it to the Cabinet He told me I might vary the phraseoloeTt- ttae construction as I chose, of course wit-oot changing the ideas; h bad neither time f nor inclination for sucbi tasks. He had prepared summary of what he meant to say in regard to the negotiations witls England, and this was written in a very Infor mal style; Lord Clarendon and Mr. Motley were) mentioned frequently by name, and matters) were discussed in srfree fashion Anita nnmntt in documents of state,- to the composition of which tbe President, was then completely un ued. I went to Governor Fish, the Secretary of State, and told hia of this, as the subject be longed to bis department. Bat the message bail not yet been shown te him, and be thought as X had been so long the secretary of General Grant I might take the liberty of making intimate suggestions. In the nd. all this matter was: eliminated, and what Mr. Fish presented wasi adopted by General Grant; for be saw af once the propriety of the change when it was proposed to him. He was, indeed, always will ing to conform to the etiquettes of his place as scrupulously as say of his predecessors. H appreciated the dignity of his post, and desired to do nothing to detract from that dignity; buf coming to the place without ever having beld eivil position of any sort, be was at first less; familiar with its forms than perhaps any whs have reached the presidency daring the present generation. -- -- ' . Tbe President's message, it la well known, wasv I once a speech, like the inaugural, and then, much shorter than it has since become, though, never so compact as the speeches from th throne abroad. -The Queen's speech is usually eon fined to half a dozen short paragraphs, whilst the utterances ef autocratic sovereigns are still And thit fVn Af Tnasi& mnni thjint nnr sn. nouneed a policy of war or invasion in a sin gist sentenoe at a New Tear reception oenbss8a dors, and all Europe baa been, disturbed by the solitary remark. "!"-; ; . . President Cleveland has almost rivaled this effect with his latest message. Few utterance of the head of a state, at home or abroad, hav attracted more attention or excited a more pos itive influence upon xha polities of his own party and that of bis opponents than the message to) Congress of the present year. , In one day it be came the absorbing topte of a thousand news papers, English and French, as well as Ameri can. The President's great rival answered hi my from Paria. and tbe hues en which parties oat this continent must move for a year to come were at once defined. One man may still pos" sees great influence ia a democracy. In another matter the President is proving himself more powerful than the Queen of Eu gland. He can not only say - what be chooses, but be can choose bis advisers. Tbe Queers must accept the Prime Minister whom tbe Com mons prefer, and the Premier selects his eol leagues; but no one dreams of interfering witlt tbe President when be promotes Mr. Vilas audi calls in Mr. Dickinson; even a Republican Sen ate is sure to confirm these nominations.

She was the first woman of position in New York to offer a flag to a colored regiment. Earl Jl in the war, before the pnblie sentiment on the subject was by any means general, she stood 04 tbe steps of ber honse on Fifth avenue, whear half of her fashionable friends opposed he course, and handed the colors which she had prepared to negro soldiers.' - Years afterward I . wrote a military wore! which contained some strictures on a prominent? soldier who was her cousin by marriage, and I sent ber a copy.

ABUSING CARLISLE. He Incurs the Wrath ot the Free-Traders b$ Retaining; Randall tn Ilia Old Position. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. Washington, Deo. 17. If it were not for the committee patronage at the disposal of Speakes Carlisle be would find himself to-night the mostl thoroughly 'abused man in Washington. The tariff reformers in the Honse are howling mad. because they have learned finally that the Speaker intends to again give tbe chairmanship of the commute on appropriations to Mr. Ran dall, of Pennsylvania. To-night the Journal correspondent was told by one of the most prom , inent Southern Senators that all the pressure that could possibly be drummed up was brought to bear on Mr. Carlisle during the snmmer and! this fall to get him to apooin' - tariff reformed in the place which Mr. Ran'-'A filled fofj four years. The Speaker ) . a r now' made known his determinate :! t r,t'-;:ii Randall in this position. " ' " i -IT re-, formers declare that their -vjA -be absolutely futile so long &c Randall is permitted to occupy the sitelii position in the Honse, outside of the Speaker a i chair, which gives him practical control of legis-l lation. The tariff reformers are unable to com: prehend why the Speaker does not give the' chairmanship of appropriations to a man in m cord with the party in its efforts to lower the) tariff. There is a good deal of half-suppressed cursing to-night, and if tbe free-traders in the House were not begging for committee positions they would openly denounce the Speaker for what they term "a lack of baeK-bone.''t3Th friends of Mr. Randall say that the Speaker knows too mucn to depose tbe head of the com mittee on appropriations; that if be did so mora, than thirty JJemoeratio members of tbe House; would refuse to go into caucus, and would ae with tbe Republicans or independently. POSTOFriCE NOMENCLATURE. A Blatter That Causes m Great Deal of Aa. noyanoe la the Department. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. Washington, Dec. 17. "Very few people havf any idea of the trouble which, the officials of this! department have in selecting the names for th new postoffiees, which are weekly established ia this country," said an official of the First Assists ant Postmaster-general's office to-day. "To thai ordinary citizen it Would seem to be the easiest thing In the world to select a name for a cross roads town. Yet the truth, is that we . hare more annoyance and bother over this apparent ly slight affair than over any other that cornea b fore us. It has been the desire of the department for some years now to prevent the duplication of names as far as possible. The residents of ss small place in which it is desired to establish ther mail service cannot understand this, and they think - that the department is? finical because it will not allow tbe peo ple directly interested to have tbe entire say ia the selection of a name. It is difficult to con vince these people that when one office In aj State is named Loraine it would be bad policy W name another office Loreu. Then, too, it is a. rule of tbe department to avoid long names and, the ending of "bore" and "ville" as far as possU ble. And yet if a dozen men conclude that they want to name their new postoffice Smithvillew they think that we are exceeding our authority, if we object to tbe seleetioa because they haver' an office dubbed Smith's Mill in the next county. This question ot a name is often of more im portance than tbe compensation of the poatmas ter. I have just settled a case to-.ay which baa been pending before the office for nearly two years, all on account of the fact that the in habitants could not agree upon a proper nam for tbe office. In all that time the people have been compelled to go nearly ten miles for theit mails, and at last the selection was left to the department, after alL
