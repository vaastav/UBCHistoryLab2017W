Tho great right of self-preservation, in the present momentous civil war, car ries with it, necessarily, tho right to dis cuss freely, every matter which may affect tho Commonwealth. The day has past forever, when any individual or class, in this State, can demand that the press, or forum shall bo silent in regard to any thing which concerns tho Commonwealth. Such a time onco existed it has gone forever, and henceforth no institution, no system of labor, no material or moral interest, w hich affects the welfare of mul titudes, can avoid tlio spirit of free in quiry and rational investigation. It may be seriously questioned whether tho sensitivenuss shown by many slave owners' in regard to their right to the possession of their slaves, does not pro ceed more from falso pride and false bonor, than from the real valuo of pro perty, which always has been uncertain and which tho fierce revolution now con Tulsing the nation has exposed to certain destruction. Few men, of their own ae cord, relinquish power, however ignoble it may be. The love of dominion is al most universal in the human heart. We delight not only in the possession of ac tual power and wealth, but wo take pleasuro in impressing others with the belief that wc aro more powerful than we really are. Nay, so far docs this ah 6urd prido lead us, that we frequently eacrifico real, substantial wealth in order todeludo tho world with a display of empty grandeur. It is this folly which prompts a poor young man to lavish his year's earnings in a suit of broadcloth, a gold watch, and a fine opera glass, and induces a lady " proud of pedigree, but poor of purse," to live on black bread, in order to flaunt her silks and paste jew dry In the ball-room. Wo aro much mistaken if thousands of slaveholders in Tennessee are not the victims of a like infatuation. Their attachment to slavery is a matter of pride, rather than of profit ; it is a venerable institution, rather than a desirable specie of property. In tho minds of many persons who havo been accustomed to the services of negro mc Dials, free labor is a phraso which in volves tho necessity of blacking one'a boots anil chopping one's fire-wood. The possession of 6laves has hitherto in the South constituted a sort of aristocracy, whoso standard of rank is tho number of slaves possessed, and the bales of cotton and hogsheads of sugar and tobacco raised. No man familiar with Southern life, and Southern literature, and poli tics, as represented by I'k Bow's Iieview, by the Ilichmond Enquirer, the Charleston Mercury, and the speeches of Kiiktt, Hammond, Sti-piuns, Davis, and Yancoy, is unacquainted with the fact that tiiey havo attempted to exalt a species of Blaveholding caste and invest tho small class of slave owners with the pomp and haughtiness of English aristocracy. It is not wonderful that thousands who havo listened to such teachings should bo loth to part with a species of property, which has lost its value in tho rnge of revolution. For this depreciation and revolution which, as it has destroyed hundreds of millions of other priftiiy, in in horses, in cattle, in grain, in growing crops, in horses, in merchandize, in stocks, in public and private improve ments, so it is destroying slave property for a revolution, like a Hood, a fire, a tempest, or a pestilence, is no respecter of persons, or of things the owners of Blavcs may thank themselves. With out cause, without excuse, with out any provocation that a sensible man would havo noticed, they al lowed themselves to be "stirred up to sndden mutiny," by a set of expelled ollicu-holdcrar They went to wur to ob tain their "rights," and the result is that Tennessee- swarms with hostile armies. Our bitterest enemies could not ask for worse evils to fall upon us than those which we now sutler; we are bleeding at every pore. Others may think and speak as they please, but as for ourselves, so help us Clod, we would not consent that one company of Tcuucsscana nhould be laujhtered on the battle-field, or pine and die in those living charnel-houses, called hospitals, to protect the slave pro perty of every master in the !outh. We would not give the life of even one intelligent, generous, industrious white non-slaveholder, to securo every slave- in the land in everlasting bondage. But this, and worse has been done, aud every day, multitudes of tho free white citizens of the Republic die "to defend the insti tions of tho South and institution in this State means African slavery. A siecies of property ought to pos sess immense value which demands so great an outlay to defend it no less an outlay in fact, than the dearest jewels of a State, her free white citizens. Has slavery any such worth to us, that we should pay so great a price as this the depopulation of our State, the devasta tion of our homes, and tho orphanage poverty, and misery of its children ? We think not. We affirm that the lives of the brave, generous, but misguided Ten ncsseans, who having been murdered by Moloch of war, 6leep to-day in un know graves, aro worth more than all tho African bondemen, who ever toiled under a tropic sun ; even placing their value at the slave dealer's old estimate of $1,000 for a good labour. No pe cuniary value can bo placed upon tho life of a good citizen. But have slaves any value in Tennessee to-day ? Few will contend they have. There aro a source of anxiety and a burden to their owners. Miserably clad, unshod, half 'starved, idlo, unrestrained, roving at large,' carried off first by one army, and then b,y the olhor, to work on roads, en frenchmen)?, and fortifications who does not see that the presence of such a population is the direst calamity which could befall us ? Instead of adding their former reputed value to the wealth of the State, we have better reason to double the sum of their estimated value, and substract it from our aggregate wealth. This is becoming generally nn derstood, both by loyal and disloyal slave owners, who express the same sen tiuients on this point, in a diffeKent man ner. Ask a Union slaveholder what he thiuks of tho prospects of slavery in Tennessee, and he will reply that he re gards it as a doomed institution, and will soon bo a thing of tho past. Ask a So cessionistjthc same question, and ho will reply curtly that he thinks slavery is going to tho devil. The only difference between the opinions. of the two men is, (hat tho latter does not make tho admis sive as cheerfully or with as good grace as the former, who is ready to submit to any pecuniary sacrifice for the sake of his country. We think then that if slave-holders will calmly purvey the field, and watch the irresistible march of events, they must contludo that slavery has ceased to be profitable in this State, and can henceforward bo regarded only as a burden and a continual source of irritation and peril. We know that these will be unpleasant reflections to men who are reluctant to give up the semblance of that power which they have long enjoyed in reality. The possession of slaves frequently brings many com forts and luxuries to their possessor, at tho expense, however, of the growth, prosperity, and intelligence of the Com monwealth. If tho poet's axiom be true, that "men, high-minded men constitute a Stale," far better would it bo to supply tho places of a hundred ignorant, de graded negroes, with a hundred intelli gent while laborers. In the place of one customer, in the person of the slave owner, the merchant, tho printer, hhoe niaker, physician, bookseller, tailor, and blacksmith, would have a hundred cus tomers in tho white laborers. The day has passed, however, when slaves possess any real value with us. They are the vnipty bhadows of wealth and power, the reality of which they represent as poorly as tho straw-crown and fanciful rags of Leak the lunatic, represent tho pomp and splendor of Lear the king. These, we say, may bo unpleasant reflections; but they aro necessary ones, which we can not avoid; and tho great question conies up, whether it is our duty, or our interest, to squaudet our treasure and best blood for a system which is tow both worth less and perilous, or shall we prepare to remove it from our midst '( All men know that by the laws of popnlatino, slavery, never adapted tooureliiiiate and products, must bo some day removed from among us; shall we determine) this matter our selves, or shall we doom our children to grapple again with this hydra in another bloody revolution ? Events beyond our control have thrust thi great issue, upon us, an issue pregnant with portentous re sults, mightier than ever came before upon any nation. Let us remember in the words of a great writer, that " lie who will not reason is a Lijit; he who can nt is a '(; and, he who ,li,ei i-. t is a thu e. The Richmond correspondent of the London Time, supposed to be William L. Yancey, writes thus of the rebellion ; " Two races have come into collision on the one side an aiustO( ract, parebj aettkl; on the other A iJioiocRAcr, numer ically four times as strong as its oppon ent." , Mr. Yancey claims that tho slave States are settled by an aristocracy, who are few in number, as though their Bmall number were a merit. It is not to be denied that tho fewer of such people there are, the better it is for mankind ; but will Yancey be able to convince the people that it Is a good thing for the land of a State to be monopolized by a few overgrown landholders ? If he does not mean to claim the sparse settlement of the slave States, as a merit on their part, why does he mention it in the connection that ho does ? All wise and humane writers on Government speak of the ab sorption of the soil of a country into a few enormous estates, as a source of des potism on the part of the few, and of degradation on the part of the many No freedom can be eDjoyed by the mass of tho people under such an arrangement; they must soon become enslaved. What ever system or institution prevents tho increase of white population in State, and excludes industry and com mercial and manufacturing enterprise, may be highly advantageous fo a small class, "but must be a direful curso to far tho greater part of tho population. In such a state tho privileged class soon become domineering, exacting and intol erant, and ready to rebel against any re striction on their demands. They hate free government, and liberal Institutions and dread any sy tern of education to en lighten the working-class worse than a deadly serpent. It is the sworn foe to democracy, and the friend of aristocratic rule. So long as 6ueh an element exists in this republic, so long must we be con vulsed with an irrepressible conllict. A Stringent Order. Tho following order has been issued by General Gkant to the troops in his department : Headquarters Department of the Tennessee. In Field Layranje (Term.) Xiv 9, 18G2. Special Field Orders No. 2. Hereafter stoppage will be made on muster and pay rolls against divisions for tho full amount of depredations committed by any member or members of the division, unless the act can bo traced cither to the individuals committing them, or to the company, regiment, or bijjado to which the offenders belong. In all casses the punishment will bo assessed to the smallest organization containing tho guilty party. Confiscation acts were never intended to be executed by soldiers, and if they were, tho General Government should have full benefit of all properiy of which' individuals are deprived. A stoppage of pay against offenders will effect this end, and it is to bo hoped will correct this growing evil. It is not only the duty of commission ed officers to correct this evil, but of all good men in the ranks to report every violation ; and it is determined now that they shall have a pecuniary interest in doing so. Assessments will also be made against commissioned officers in tho pro portion of their pay proper. Where offences of tho nature contem plated in this order aro traced to indi viduals, they will be summarily punished to the full extent formerly given to gar rison court martials, or bo arrested and tried by general court martial, according to tho enormity of the offence, and tho severest penalties provided imposed and executed. This order will be read on parade, before each regiment and detachment, for three successive evenings. By order of Maj.-Gcn. U. S. Grant. 

JOHN A. UAWL1NGS, Assistant Adjutant General. We believe in tho justice and necessity of confiscation, and oppose individual seizures of property, which is liable to confiscation, not simply for the reason that such seizures arc wrong in them selves, but because they neutralize and nullify tho confiscation law, so as to prevent its being of any benefit to the Government. We have need of a similar order in this locality. The coufiscatijn law will be deprived of its moral influ ence if officers or soldiers are allowed to seize forfeited properly, for their personal emolument. i"A correspondent advises that tho fugi tive negroes ill the city bo put to work on the Nashville and Northwesteru Rail road, and kept there until it shall bo finished We learn that tho road is al ready graded, 'and that the expense of completing it would be comparatively trilling. The suggestion is worthy of attention. We know of i.o Letter work which the fugitives can be put to. The road is needed, and it is highly desira ble that the negroes be employed and 1 cared for, or that the i cbcls may derive 1 no aid fi m their labor, i Forms of Bonds. The following forms of bonds have been adopted by the U. S. Military au thorities, to meet cases arising in this Department. The form of Bond and Protection heretofore pnbliihed,is intended for loyal citiiens only. ; The first form, of Oath of Allegiance and Bond, and Protection, is intended fjr persons who have determined upon becoming reconciled fo the Federal Gov ernment, and to remain hereafter as true and loyal citizens.

Tennessee, tun-ty, hereby acknowledge ourselves indebted to the 1. mteu Mates I of America in the sum of , dolUis, for the payment of which we bin 1 ourcelves, our heirs, executors and representative firmly by these; presents. The condition of this bond is such that the above bounden -has this day taken and subscribed tho foro going oath. Now, therefore, if he shall, well and faithfully keep inviolate his aid solemn oath, then these presents shall be void, otherwiso to be in full forco and effect. I..S. i,. s. L.s. Signed, sealed, acknoweledged and sworn to before me, in testimony whereof, witness my hand and official Seal, this day of 1SG . Protection to Non-Comdatants. Tho within named person having proper ly taken the oath of a non-combatant, is henceforth to be respected and pro tected in both person and property, as such, and all trespassing, pillaging and marauding upon such person is strictly prohibited. When necessary to use his or her prepcrty, hereafter, for the support of the Federal armies, it shall be done in a regular manner, and full receipt be given for the same, and the property be paid for by the United States Govern ment, according to law in such cases mado and provided, upon the owner pro ducing satisfactory proof that this oath and bond has been kept inviolate. Questions have arisen as to the nature of tho parole oath, why and how far it is binding. In answering them I shall assume that to be true which is not so, viz: That the Southern Confederacy is a lawfully established government, whence it ivould follow that males of Tennes see capable of bearing arms are liable to be put into its army. According to the laws of war, it is at the option of the Federal Government to dispose of such persons who aro within its lines, and their effects, as it sees fit, subject to the laws and usages of civil ized nations. If by those laws an in vading army may depopulate a country, and tako captive its inhabitants, with greater reason, as a lesser evil, it may take prisoner and confine whenever and wherever it may bo necessary, to prevent mischief, thoso of them liable and likely to bear arms against it. When it says to them, ' Out of human ity I will not do so. I will even allow you to follow your peaceful avocations, if you will pledge me, and keep your prom ise, that you will do no military mis chief," this is a great relaxation of its rights in favor of humanity. Tho parole of a soldier not fo take up arms until lawfully exchanged overides all his obligations as a citizen, and his oath of enlistment, and, as a relaxation of the rigor of war, is held sacred by civilized nations. The parole of a harmless inhabitant is a still greater mitigation of the rights of war, because it does more good and he is under but tho singlo obligation of a citizen. For still stronger reasons it must therefore be held sacred by all who pre tend to civilization or even to humanity. Its justice is obvious. It is humano and promotes the welfare of tho country, and is for the benefit of tho people as well as of whoever ultimately holds it. The benefits of this parole are extended, beyond thoso capable of bearing arms, to ali individuals, male and female, w he desire to benefit by tho protection which it promises: On condition that they will faithfully keep their contract not to do mischief to our armies. , Tho motto of our Government is not that of the Confederate revolutionists, " rule or ruiu" but "Government is for tho good of the people." The end to be attained, and tho justice of the means, being thus pointed out, I havo only to say that the non-combatants' oath is just, aud will bo held binding duiing the war; and thoso who take it, unless exchanged like prisoners of war, will be absolved from its obligation only when the war is ended. This non-combatants' parole is an act of grace and humanity, for the benefit of those who, fr various reasons or neces sities, are or have been unwilling to bind themselves to perform the duties and thus become entitled to the full privileges and protection of loyal citizens. Being wholly inapplicable to loyal citizens they will neither bo expected nor per mitted, except in special cases or for special reason, to tako it. W. S. ROSKCUANS, Major-General.

" The papers of last night contain tele graphic abstract of tho Message. wo shall give it in full to-morrow, wotvill quote only that portion relating tolho slavery question : The President refers fo hin compenn ted emancipation proclamation of St tetnber 22d, and says, that portion ot te earth occupied by the jicople of the Unitci States is well adapted to the hoaie of on national family, but not for two or more. In tho inaugural address I briefly pointed out the total inadequacy of disunion as a remedy for differences between the pco plo of the two sections. I did so in lan guage which I cannot improve. Physically speaking, we cannot separate; wo cannot remove our respective sections from each other, nor build an impassable wall be tween them. He then remarks at length on the difficulty of making any national boundary line. The President then suggests amend ments to the Constitution, Congress con curring, to be proposed to the legislatures or conventions of the several States, which, if ratified by three-fourths of said legislatures, to be valid as parts of said Constitution. The First article pro poses that ali States abolishing slavery beforo January 1st, 1900, shall receive compensation from tho United States. Second. All slaves freed by the chances of war at any time before the end of tho rebellion, shall be forever free, but all owners who had not been disloyal Bhould be compensated. Third. Congress may appropriate money and otherwise pro vide for colonizing free colored persons, with their consent, at any placo without tho United States. The President discusses these articles at some length and asks, " if, then, for a common object, slave property is to be sacrificed, is it not just that it bo dono at a common charge? and-if with lees money, or money moro easily paid, wo can prescrvo tho benefits of the Union by this means than wo can by the war alone, is it not economical to do it? The proposed emancipation would short en tho war, perpetuate peace, ensure an increase in population, and, proportion ately, tho wealth of the country. The President then says the plan con sisting of these articles is recommended not but that a restoration of national authority woultj be accepted without its adoption, nor will the war or proceed ings under the proclamation of Septeni teniber 22nd bo stayed because of tho recommendation of this plan, its timely adoption, I doubt not, would bring res toration, and thereby stay both; and, notwithstanding this plan, the recom mendation that Congress provide by law for compensating any State which may adopt the emancipation before this plan shall have been acted upon, is hereby earnestly renewed. This plan is recom mended as a means not in conclusion, if but additional to all others, for restoring and perserving the national authority throughout tho Union. Tho subject il presented exclusively in its economica. aspect. The plan is proposed as perma nent, constitutional law. - In conclusion, the President says the ' dogmas of tho quiet past aro inadequat. to tho stormy present. Tho aecusalioi H piled high with difficulty and wo inus. rise with the occasion. The fiery tria through w hich w e pass w ill light us dowi in honor or dishonor to tho latest gen-c oration. We say that we are for tho Union The world will not forget that while w say II lis, wc do know how to sav the Union. In giving freedom to tb class we ensure freedom to the free; hoi- , orablo alike in what we give and wh.t wo receive. Wo shall nobly save r meanly lose tho last, best hope of tb earth. Other means may succeed, thi cannot fail. Tho way is plain, peacefu, generous, just; away which if follower, the world will forever applaud, and Gol must forever bless.
