Ria operatlona I Clftef were confined chiefly to the v can . oast and among the Canaries I ape Verde islands. Bui one incident of Iiis career among the New Kngland whalers before he left ; ' Mtliern waters will illustrate the I 1. and ingenuity of the slurilv sen 1 of that day. I I Carrie Haid, of Hoston. sailed ' "i that city, manned with a crew of 1 '.'s, ai i! after ten weeks of suc- rrssfql whaling, she turned her prow toward lmmc. landed gown with Mob '"' ladwbalaaU. Her crew were in the f spirita, aatielpating large profits t th. ir cargo, and a hearty welcome " by t heir w i ves. children and sweet hearts. P" July 10 she sighted lnnd. which 1 red to tie a rocky headland on the M line coast. With this guide post lati tat captain and crew that they il le in Ttrvston harbor in n few very body began to make prepara- 1 nsfor binding. Beery thing about the cel was put ship-shnpe. nnd the old i lors even got their belongings to I tbei and packed them in bags and illclotb, Hut lefore Mount Desert island II llgbtog, a sail was seen heading low. -mi the const, standing up frotn the I like a great, white cloud, ( apt.

Most of the trad i ssels stood well out front the r'n kj Maine shore. Hill an hour later Capt. Haid fell rea aj ably eure that the uouroathinif sail meant mischief, and that his w huler wss iu imminent duuger "We'll run in a bit," he remarked to bis first mate. Ixjii": familiarity with the New Kng land coast now stood him in good serv ice, fie ran his craft .., dose to the shore that it was dangen i- for one not familiar with the channels to follow. "It's no use. captain," the lirst mate said after a long pans.-. "If tbat'l ( apt. Low be kaowa every inch of this water. lie's belt, r acquainted with this coast than any other whaling cap- taiu from Portland to New Bedford." "Well, if it ain't Ned Low, we'll give him u ebene among these rocks that he won't forget ven aonnaM replied grufl Capt. Haid, pulling his long w bisk, ri nervously. In a -In.rt time tlie black flag of the niraton indicated even to the en w what mission the siiip was bent on. There was a short time of general fear when stout beerte quaked and nigged faces t uracil palt), Kvery sailor knew the cruelty of the pirate captain and Iiis horde of savages. Then ( apt. Bald call -d the crew to gcther anil addressed tb.m in tbene w ords : HWn may an well face tbii little dilti cnlty bravely, my men, and not mince mattore. Tbnt'i Ned IVnw'a ship, and ye know what lie's after: he iie.r sbOWl mercy to anybody, espeicially to a New Engländer, and we'd better die fighting than be strung up to the yardarm or iiaxe our lips and noses cut oil for a fry. We've got harpoons and axes aboard, and every one of ye knows how to ue 'em. So just get 'ein ami stick together and fight until ye're dead. Just remember that it's better to be killed than to fall in their hands. 1 II use my wits to get away from them, but if worst comes to worst, wemust tight. That'sull." The stout words of the grim old whal ing captain lent new courage to the cr. w, and they gave a little cheer that meant more than the loud huzzah of a crowd. Kvery man felt that he was about to face death, and he was deter mined to do it with a brave front. Nearer und nearer approached the threatening boat, on whose decks black WaflBI of armed men could now be seen. A small swivel gun sent a ball ricocheting across the waves toward the whaling schooner, but the latter COB tinned to tbread her way carefully at long the sunken rocks. The pirate craft, when she reaehtd the outlying fringe of rocks, hove to and beat up and down like a duck un certain which way to go. "It's dangerous water here if you don't know your way." muttered Capt. Haid, "and I guess you don't know it." lb- was scanning the ship through his sea glasses. "Aba; Now Capt. Low takes the wheel. His pilot don't know the way. Now we're in for it 1" There WM a change noticeable on board the pirate. Then she directed !n r course onee more toward the rocks and plunged boldly bet ween them, fol lowing the narrow , tort nous eha nnel. Cant. Bald watched her in silence. Then his light blue eyes, shaded by thick, shaggy eyebrows, grew worried JsE r 4L sf . . i f v. -i . e-c-s A DBNfK WREATH OF 8MOKK COL'U BE IB EM CVRLINQ ll'WAKI. and restless. He scanned the sea and the ehore, and then he returned hi nna to the pirate. "We can't lose them here." be said finally to his first mate. "They'll over haul us before night, and then " He shuddered involuntarily. " i miL'bt ran lierairroinul and swim for the shore," he ejaculated, finally "No, we'll run her up the liver. Thi is Machias Point, and We might reach the river ahead of 'em." This decision was no sooner mad than the order was given to hang the course of the schooner. In half an hour she rounded the joitit ami stood in toward the mouth of the river. Th pirate craft sent several solid sli..' after the old whaler, but the aim was poor, done am' no particular damage was It was late in t lie afternoon when tin Carrie silled up the mouth of the rive against I strong tide, with the pirate . raft less than a mile astern The const at this point was bleak and deserted in those dav s. and it was almost as cer tain a death to land and desert th ship as to face the pirates. "Still, we'll do it," Capt. Bald said "It's better to fall among the Indian than among these human fiends. I'd rather be eaten bv wolves than havemv longtM and cm s gongnd out." The pirates were so certain of their prey now that their iouil shout or defi ance could be distinctly heard by the whaling crew. Suddenly Cnpt. Bald started, and. know ing tluit the best way to keep his men hrac was to find em ploy nient for them, he gave onl. s qulckly. "(ict the whabboats ready for ac tion ! " he shouted. There were four of these, two on either side, nnd earh one wns manned with a ci. w of three sailors ai,d an of ficer. When the men had unlnshed them from the davits, the captain shouted: Form a wuter-buckel briguue for fire in the hold!" This strange order made gOeM of the men hesitate, but explicit obedience is their captain's word had become hab it with them. When the men were in line umied with tbeir buckets, (apt. Haid went lielow, and la u few minutes the men were pass ing the buckets from one to Iba other, empty ing their content first into one whalelKint and then into another But then was no fln- to fight, and the men were not handling water Tiny were dipping the whale oil from the great tanks anil hogsheads in the hold and pouring it into the vmnll boats Bnongb! shouted tbe eaptaln a lit le later. "Kverv man on deck!" The novelty of the orders made the men now ol.ev with alacrity, anil ther id portly forgotten their danger in tln-ir exertions. But when they as- einlded on deck again and MW the ..rate only a short distance off their aces paled ol'- e more. But Capt. Haid realized that the mo ment for action had come, and he gave bis orders in epiick. irp commands. Lower IBB boats and tie them to gether with a rope M feet long!" lie fastened ni f the lengths of rope to the ft ist boat himself, and threw the other end to the first mate. Th. pirntes saw the InOBohlng of the four whalebonts. and prepared to do the same with their boats. Hut thev little re- zed that the brave seamen were not making ready to escape to the shore, but were planning for theirdestruction. "I w nnt four brave mer, w ho are w Hi ng to ri.k t heir lives for the rest of r.s: Capt. Haid said, in Iiis usual abrupt way. Will tbey please step forw ard ? ' Instead of four men every one of th crew stepped forward. That's enough, my brave men." the captain said, while his eyes grew moist. Ml select me men." Then taking four of his most tnist- wnrthy sailors he gave them brief but emphatic directions what to do. The sailors nodded their heads and jumped lata tbe bOOtn, ench carryinu a life-pre-pre server w ith him. The last words the captain said to them were: Kerneinber the right bank! Qwim toward it. nnd I'll pick you tip." What could he mean? The sailors on hoard the Carrie asked this, and the pirates must have lieen COrlOBI also to know. They stopped a mOBsCal in their yelling nnd watched the peculiar pro ceedings of the men in ths haleboat. The four loats shot silt from the Carrie and w ere row ed dlectlv toward the pirate, the strong cu.-rent of the river helping them in their speed. The pirates did not notice at first that each boat was fastened by BtfOOg rojes to ich other'! prows. They were too in tent in watching The strar.ee proceed ings of this attack. It might have dawned upon their obtuse minds that part of the r. of the Carrie had de serted, or that thev were coining tc plead fnr mercy. But the four rowers were silent and active. When tbey W ere w.t hir. :. yards f the pirate the men threw nway their oars simultaneously and bent over something in the middle of their whale boats. There was a tiny spark of light. a flash and then a sudden upward blae. The four brave mm slipped over the side of their boats into the water and lisappeared. But the flames which they and started burned furiously. The whale nil in the bottom of the boats furnished fuel that made a fire hard to extinguish. The tide was carrying the boats rapidly dow n the river tow ard the pirate. Then for the first time the pirates noticed that the boats were tied together, forming n wide line stretch ing half across the river. Inatantly there was commotion on board the pirate snip. In the confusion everybody forgot the prey they had so neatlv hen. med in the river. The guns were aimed at the approaching oil boat of fire, and ore was actually blown to piece, but the Ml noateo on in.' water and only spread the flames. In few minutes t DC fire boats struck the pirate ship, and the ropes holding them together drew the end boats around toward the ship in nich a way that flames were soon spreading through the rigging and bail. A few brave pirates climbed down and cut the ropes, but before they floated away the ship was a luiL'' mass of flames nnd smoke. b aawbile Capt. Bald hnd nnt been idle. Just as soon ns his men dropped into the water from the fire boats he crowded on all sail. nnd. helped fay the tide, he went bowling down the river eloee 117 toward the right bank. While the pirates were fighting the fire anil trying to avert the doOBl of their ship Capt. Bald w as leisurely pick ing up the four brave sailors who had OB lined the mischief. "Now we'll stand out to sen." he snid "and let 'em chase M ngnin." But the last he saw of t he pirates. a his schooner rounded the point of lane! at the mouth of the river, was n cheer ing sight. Most of them were seeking safety in the water. For more than tWI hours a dense wresth of smoke could be seen curling upward, and as long as it was visible Capt. Bald chuckled softly to himself on the forward deck. "What wouldn't (apt. Tow give tc cntch me," he said over and over again "He'd cook me alive ar.d feed me to hit men " Hut no one was more joyful over th outcome of the encounter w ith the cele brated pirnte chief than the sailors oi the Carrie, who ever nfterwnrd tolri with great glee how they helped to burn ' Ned LnWa lest ship.

The evil of the present sM.m Is found In the great cost to the government of maintaining st a parity .th gold our d.lercni forms of nn my. an I the experience of tie- past four year hae demonstrated that this is not only an expensive charge upon the government, but a dangerous menace to the national credit It is manifest that we must d-v is. iodic plan to protect the government aga.n-t bond issues for repeated redemptions, We have fwuu.uuu.uw of ..urrency, wuich the gov rnment. by solemn enactment, has undertaken to keep at par, and nobody is obliged to redeem in gold but trie government, which must borrow the gold. The law, which requires the payment out of the treasury of redeemed t'nited s,tates notes, demands a constant replenishment of the f;old reserve, especially In times of panic and nsufflcient revenue, and during the preceding administration IÄ -per-oent bonds were iasued and sold to sustain the gold reserve and pay the eipenses of the government In excess of revenue. While It is true that a greater part of this Is used to supply dettclent revenues, a considerable por tion was required to maintain the gold reserva If no further legislation la to be had. to correct this and the policy of selling bonds is to be continued, then congress should give the sec retary of the treasury authority to sell bonds at long or short periods, bearing a less rate of Interest than Is now authorized tc law. The president says: Krfnm men Oat Ions. "1 earnestly recommend as soon as the receipts f the government sre quite sufficient to pay all the expenses of the government, that when any United States n'tes are presented for redemp tion In gold and are redeemed in gold, such notes hall be kept and set apart and only paid out In e change for gold This Is an bvloua duty. If the holder of she United States note prefers tbe gold and get It from the government ae should not receive bark from the govern ment a United States note without paying gold Ui exchange for it." That amounts to the president's mind, to giv ing an interest bearing debt, a government bni'.. for a nun-Interest bearing dem. a United Stales note.

He also recommends that the issue of national bank notes Be rr atricted to the denominat .on of ten dollars and upwards and that they be required to redeem their notes m gold. The t'ubnn Question.
