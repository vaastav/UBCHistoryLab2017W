2 PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S FIRST MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. 'this economic policy. Nothing could be more un . ■*■ than to disturb the business Interests of the ' tmwilUj by any jreneral tariff change at thin time. Doubt, apprehension, uncertainty are exactly what We most WSBS to avoid in the Interest of our com mercial and material weHbeing. Our experience In UK past has shown that sweeping revisions of the tariff are apt to produce conditions close.y ap proaching panic In the business world. et it is 1 9Ot only possible, but eminently desirable, to com i bine with the stability of cur economic system a Supplementary system of reciprocal benefit and 1 obligation with other nations. Such reciprocity M lan Incident and result of th- firm establishment and preservation of our present economic policy It was specially provided for in the present tariff l8 Re-iprocitv must be treated as the hand maiden of protection. Our first duty is to see that .The protection granted by the tariff In every case .-•more it I* needed is maintained, and that reel . procity be sought for so far as it can safely be : done without injury to our homo industries Just : ha* far this is must be determined according to 'the individual case, remembering always that every ' application of our tariff policy to meet our shifting i rational Tigris must be conditioned upon the car • dinar fact that the duties must never be reduced .'•below the point that will cover the difference be ' kM the labor cost here and abroad. The weii ' being of the wageworker Is ■ prime consideration V our entire policy of economic legislation. , Subject to this proviso of the proper protection I necessary to our industrial wellbeing at home, the i principle, of reciprocity must command our hearty 5 support. The phenomena! growth of our export P-trade emphasizes the urgency of the need for #-wlder markets and for a liberal policy in dealing 'r^vith foreign nations. Whatever is merely petty & a: d vexatious in the way of trade restrictions i should be avoided. The customers to whom we Ldi=pose of cur surplus products in the long run. directly or indirectly, purchase those surplus prod ucts by giving us something in return. Their ability Vto purchase Bar products should as far as possible Iks secured by so arranging our tariff as to enable | us to take from them those products which we rcan use without harm to our own industries and {labor, or the use of which will be of marked benefit [atTs most important that we should maintain the rfcjgh level of our present prosperity. We have now -reached the point in the development of our inter ests where we are not only able to supply our own Markets, but to produce a constantly growing sur plus for which we must find markets abroad. To secure these markets we can utilize existing duties C any case where they are no longer needed for ■the purpose of protection, or in any case where (the article is not produced here and the duty is no hawser necessary for revenue, as giving us some thing to offer in exchange for what we ask. The Scordial relations with other nations which are so Ldeslrable -will naturally be -promoted by the course 3thus required by our own interests. ! The natural line of development for a policy of Wrciprocitv will be in connection with those of our reductions which no longer require all of the sup ! port once needed to establish them upon a sound -•basis, and with those others where, either because jSof natural or of economic causes, we are beyond £th» reach of successful competition. • I a«k the sttention of the Senate to the reci procity treaties laid before It by my predecessor.

MERCHANT MAMXE. } ■ ■ '*■ The condition of the American merchant marine %- such as to call for immediate remedial action tt>v th» Congress. It is discreditable to us as a Iration that our merchant marine should be utterly (Mncigr.ln.-ant in comparison to that of other nations Which we overtop in other forms of business. \\ c Should not loncer submit to conditions under which ion.v a. trifling portion of our great commerce is »< -led in our own ships. To remedy this state of S ngs would not merely serve to build up our Shipping interests, but it would also result in bene fit to all who are Interested in the permanent es tablishment of a. wider market for American prod- J-U"ts. and would provide an auxiliary force for the V-Tiavy. Ships work for their own countries, just as , Railroads work for their terminal points. Shipping ■ Sines, if established to the principal countries with "ivhich we have dealings, would be of political as -well as commercial benefit. From every standpoint it is unwise for the United States to continue to xely upon the ships of competing nations for the .distribution of our goods. It should be made ad vantageous to carry American goods in American Jfcuilt ships. i At present American shipping is under certain hrreat disadvantages when put in competition with It he shipping of foreign countries. Many of the Mast foreign steamships, at a speed of fourteen Iknots or above, are subsidized; and all our ships, §6alling vessels and steamers alike, cargo carriers V' slow speed and mail carriers of Viieh speed, have k *:r. meet the fact that the original cost of building American ships is greater trra.i i* the case abroad; P^lhat the wages paid American officers and seamen • fare very much higher than those paid the officers ' fen* seamen of foreign competing countries; and Pthat the standard of living on our ships is far feuperior to the standard of living on the ships of Sour commercial rivals. I Our government should take such action as will {(remedy these Inequalities. The American merchant Snarine should be restored to the ocean. I 

CURRENCY a \i> BANKING. 6 The act of March 14. 1900, Intended unequivocally So establish gold as the standard money and to Maintain at a parity therewith all forms of money Medium in use with us. has been shown to be time- Sly and judicious. The price of our government fbonds in the world's market, when compared with She price of similar, obligations issued by other fcations. is a flattering tribute to our public credit, grtis condition it is evidently desirable to maintain. Cln many respects the National Banking law fur bishes sufficient liberty for the proper exercise of gthe banking function; but there seems to be need of ►better safeguards against the deranging influence fif commercial crises and financial panics. More- Sover. the currency of the country should be made pesponsive to the demands of our domestic trade fend commerce. J The collections from duties on imports and in ternal taxes continue to exceed the ordinary ex penditures of the government, thanks mainly to the treduced army expenditures. The utmost care should fV taken not to reduce the revenues so that there $■*■::! be any possibility of a deficit; but. after pro viding against any such contingency, means should S>e adopted which will bring the revenues more Nearly within the limit of our actual needs. In his &eport to the Congress th« Secretary of the Treas ury considers all these questions at length, and I kifk your attention to the report and recommenda aions. * I call special attention to the need of strict Economy in expenditures. The fact that our na- Kional needs forbid us to be niggardly in providing {►whatever is actually necessary to our wellbeing ■Should make us doubly careful to husband our Eiational resources as each of us husbands his prl- Hate resources, by scrupulous avoidance of any- Jthlng like wasteful or reckless expenditure. Only K;y avoidance of spending money on what is need ■■BS or unjustifiable can we legitimately keep our .Income to the point required to meet our needs that ;»re genuine THE RAILWAYS. In IRST a measure was enacted for the. regulation ■of Interstate railways, commonly known as the "Interstate Commerce act. Tile cardinal provisions of that act -were that railway rates should be just and reasonable and that all shippers, localities and commodities should be accorded equal treatment. A commission was created and endowed with what •were supposed to be the necessary powers to cxc ' cute the provisions of this act. That law was largely an experiment. Experience has shown the wisdom of its purposes, but has also shown, possibly that some of Its requirements are ■wrong, certainly that the means devised for the enforcement of Its provisions are defective. Those ■who complain of the management of the railways nllege. that established rates are not maintained; that rebate* and similar devices arc habitually re sorted to: that these preferences are usually in favor «f the large shipper; that they drive out of business the sinailer competitor: that while many rates are too low. many others are excessive, and that gross preferences arc made, affecting both < 'localities and commodities. Upon the other hand, ' the railways assert that the law by its very terms I tends to produce many of these illegal practices by I depriving carriers of that right of concerted action - 'which they claim Is necessary to establish and : I maintain non-discriminating rates. y'. Tho *it should b* amended. The railway is a ; —■bJk tsrvsr.t. -Its rates should F o« s ufii ta «— - open to .ill shipper!" alike. The government should see to It that within its Jurisdiction this is so, and should provide a speeds inexp^ive an d effective remec-y to that end. At the snme Ume it must not be for gotten that our railways are the arteries through Which the commercial life blood of this nation flows. Nothing could be more foolish than the enactment r,f legislation which would unnecessarily interfere with the development and operation o. these commercial agencies. The suhiect is on» o. great importance, and calls for the earnest atten tion Of the Congress. FOREST CONSERVA TIOX. Tho Deportment of Agriculture during the last fiftem years has steadily broadened its work on economic lines, and has accomplished results of real value in upmiilding domestic and foreign trade. It has gone into new fields until it is now in touch with all sections of our country and with two of the island groups that have lately come under our jurisdiction, whose people must look to agriculture as a livelihood. It is searching the world for grains, grasses, fruits ;-nd vegetables specially fitted for introduction into localities In the several States and Territories whero they may add ma terlnlly to our resources. By scientific attention tn soil survey and possible new crops, to breeding of new varieties of plants, to experimental shipments, to animal industry and applied chemistry, very practical aid has been given our farming and stock growing interests. The products of the farm have taken an unprecedented place in our export trade during the year that has just closed. Public opinion throughout the United States has moved steadily toward a just appreciation of the value of forests, whether planted or of natural growth. The great part played by them In. the creation and maintenance of the national wealth is now more fully realized than ever before. Wise forest protection does not mean the with drawal of forest resources, whether of wood, water or srass from contributing their full share to the welfare of the people, but. on the contrary, gives the assurance of larper and more certain supplies. The fundamental Mea of forestry is thf perpetua tion of forests by use. Forest protection is not an end of itself; it is a means to increase and sustain the resources of our country and the industries which depend upon them. The preservation of our forests is an imperative business necessity. We have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forest, except to make way for agriculture, threatens our weHbeing. The practical usefulness of the national forest reserves to the mining, grazing, irrigation and other interests of the reeions in which the reserves lie has led to a widespread demand by the people of the West for their protection and extension. The forest reserves will inevitably be .if still greater use In the future than in the past. Additions should be made to them whenever practicable, and their use fulness should be increased by a thoroughly busi nesslike management. At present the protection of the forest reserves re? t s with the General Land Office, the mapping and description of their timber with the X'nlted States Geological Survey, and the preparation of plans for their conservative use with the Bureau of Forestry, which is also charged with the general advancement of practical forestry in the I'nited States. These various functions should be united in the Bureau of Forestry, to which they properly belong The present diffusion of responsibility is bad from every standpoint. It prevents that effective co-operation between the government and the men who utilize the resources of the reserves, without which the interests of both must suffer. The scientific bureau generally should be put under the Department of Agriculture. The President should have by law the power of transferring lands fir use as forest reserves to the Department of Agriculture. He already has BUch power in the case r,f lands needed by the departments of War and the Navy. The wise administration of the forest reserve will be not less helpful to the interests which depend on water than to those which depend on wood and grass. The water supply itself depends upon th© forest. In the arid region it is water, not land, which measures production. The western half of the United States would sustain a population greater than that of our whole country to-day If the waters that now run to waste were saved and used for irrigation. The forest and water problems are perhaps the most vital internal questions of the United States. 

GAME PRESERVES. Certain of the forest reserves should also be mad« preserves for the wild forest creatures. All of the reserves should be better protected from fires. Many of them need special protection because of the great injury done by live stock, above all by sheep. The increase in deer, oik and other animals In the Yellowstone Park shows what may be expected when other mountain forests are properly protected by law and properly guarded. Some of these areas have been so denuded of surface vegetation by overgrazing that the ground breeding birds, Includ ing grouse and quail, and many mammals, including deer, have been exterminated or driven away. At the same time the water storing capacity of the surface has been decreased or destroyed, thus pro moting floods in times of rain and diminishing the flow of streams between rains. In cases where natural conditions have been re stored for a few years, vegetation has again car peted the ground, birds and deer are coming back, and hundreds of persons, especially from the Im mediate neighborhood, come each summer to enjoy the privilege of camping. Some, at least, of the forest reserves should afford perpetual protection to the native fauna and flora, safe havens of refuge to our rapidly diminishing wild animals of the larger kinds, and free camping grounds for the ever increasing numbers of men and women who have learned to find rest, health and recreation in the splendid forests and flower clad meadows of our mountains. . The forest reserves should be set apart forever for the use and benefit of our people as a whole, and not sacrificed to the shortsighted greed of a few. The forests are natural reservoirs. By restraining the streams in flood and replenishing them In drouth they make possible the use of water? other wise wasted. They prevent the soil from washing, and so protect the storage reservoirs from filling up with silt. Forest conservation Is therefore nn es sential condition of writer conservation. Tho forests alone cannot, however, fully regulate and conserve the waters of the arid region. Great storaee works are n#ces«sary to equalize the flow of streams and to save the flood waters. Their construction has been conclusively shown to he an undertaking too vapt fnr private effort. Nor can it be best accomplished by the individual States act ing alone. Far reaching Interstate problems are Involved, and the resources of single States would often be inadequate. It Is properly a national function, at least in some of Its features. It is as right for the national government to make the streams and rivers of the arid region useful by engineering wc.rks for water storage as to make useful the rivers and harbors of the humid region by engineering works of another kind. The storing of the floods In reservoirs at the headwaters of our rivers is but an enlargement of our present policy of river control, under which levees are built on the lower reaches of the fame streams. The government should construct and maintain these reservoirs as It does other public works. Where their purpose is to ro-gulate the. flow of streams, the water should be turned freely into the channels in the dry season to take the same course under the same laws as the natural flow. 

IRRIGATION. The reclamation of the unsettled arid public lands presents a different problem. Here It is not enough to regulate the flow of streams. The object of the government is to dispose of the land to settlers who will build homes upon it. To accomplish this object water must be brought within their reach. The' pioneer settlers on the arid public domain choße their homes along streams from which they could tht-mselvts divert the water to reclaim their holdings. Such opportunities are practically gone. There remain, however, vast areas of public land which can be made available for homestead settle ment, but only by reservoirs and main line canals impracticable for private enterprise. These irrign ti<jji works should be built hy the national gov ernment. The lands reclaimed by them should be reserved hy the government fur actual settlers. and the cost of construction should so far as pos sible be repaid by the land reclaimed. The dis tribution of the water, the division of the streams among irrigators. should he left to the s»ttlers themselves in conformity with State laws and without interference with those laws or with vested rights. The policy- of the national government NEW-xU!^ DAILY TBIIMNE. WEDNESDAY. DECEMBER 3. 1901. should be to aid irrigation in the several States and Territories in such maner as will enable the people In the local communities to help them seivrs. and as will stfmulnte needed reforms in the State laws and regulations governing irrigation. The reclamation and settlement of the arid lands will enrich every portion of our country, just as the settlement of the Ohio and Mississippi valleys brought prosperity to the Atlantic Stales. The In creased demand for manufactured articles will stimulate industrial production, while wider home markets and the irade of Asia Will consume the larger food supplies and effectually prevent West ern competition with Eastern agriculture. Indeed, the products of irrigation will be consumed chiefly in upbuilding local centres of mining and other Industries, which would otherwise not come into existence at nil. Our people as a whole will profit, for successful home making is hut another name for the upbuilding of the nation. The necessary foundation has already been laid for the inauguration of the policy just described. It would he unwise to begin by doing too much. f,.r ■ great deal will doubtless be learned, both as to what can and -..-hat cannot be safely attempted. by the early efforts, which must of necessity he partly experimental in character. At the very be ginning the government should make clear, beyond shadow of doubt. Its intention to pursue this policy on lines of the broadest public interest. No reser voir or canal should ever he built to satisfy selfish personal or local interests, but only in accordance with the advice of trained experts, after long In vestigation has shown the locality where all the conditions combine to make the work most needed find fraught with Ihe greatest usefulness to the community as a whole. There should be no ex travagance, and the believers In the need of irriga tion will most benefit their cause hy seeing to It that it is free from the least taint of excessive or reckless expenditure of the public moneys. WATER CONTROL. Whatever the nation does for the extension of irrigation should harmonize with nnd tend to im prove the condition of those now living on Irrigated land We are not at the starting point of this de velopment. Over two hundred millions of private capital has already been expended in the con struction of irrigation works, and many million acres of arid land reclaimed. A hi*h degree of enterprise and ability has been shown In the work ftself- but as much cannot be said in reference to the laws relating thereto. The security and value of the homes created depend largely on the stability of titles to water, but the majority of these rest on the uncertain foundation of court decisions rendered in ordinary suits at law. With a few creditable exceptions, the arid States have failed to provide for the certain and just division of streams In times of scarcity. Lax and uncertain laws have made it possible to establish rights to water in excess of actual uses or necessities, and many streams have already passed Into private owner ship, or a control equivalent to ownership. Whoever controls a stream practically controls the land it rend-rs productive, and the doctrine of private ownership of water apart from land cannot prevail without causing enduring wrong. The recognition of such ownership, which has been permitted to grow up In th* arid regions, should gfve way to a more enlightened and larger recogni tion of the rights of the public in the control and disposal of the public water supplies. Laws found ed upon conditions obtaining In humid regions, where water is too abundant to justify hoarding it. have no proper application in a dry country. In the arid States the only right to water which should be recognized Is that of use. In Irrigation this right should attach to the land reclaimed and be Inseparable therefrom.. Granting perpetual water rights to others than users, without com pensation to the public, is open to all the ohjec tiona which apply to giving away perpetual fran chises to the public utilities of cities. A few of the Western States have already recognized this, and have incorporated In their constitutions the doc trine of perpetual State ownership of water. The benefits which have followed the unaide.) de velopment of the past justify th* nation's aid and co-operation in the more difficult an.! Important work yet to be accomplish.-.!. l,aw< so vitally affecting homes as those which control the water supply will only be effective when they have the sanction of the lrrigators; reforms can only he final and satisfactory when they come, through the enlightenment of the people most concerned. The larcer development which national aid Insures should, however, awaken In every arid State the determination to make its Irrigation system* equal in justice, and effectiveness that of any country In the civilized world. Nothing could be more unwise than for Isolated communities to continue t-« learn everything experimentally. Instead or profiting hy what Is already known elsewhere. We are dealing with a new and momentous question, in the preg nant years while institutions are forming, and what we do will affect not only the present but future generations. Our aim Should be not simj'lv to reclaim the largest area of land and provide homes for the largest number of people, but to create for this new industry the bfst possible soda] ar.d Industrial conditions; and this requires that we not only understand the existing situation, but avail our ■elves of the best experience of the time In the solution of Its problems. A careful study should be made, both by the nation and the States, of the irrigation laws and conditions here and abroad. Ultimately it will probably be necessary for the nation to co-operate with the several arid States in proportion as these States by their legislation and administration show themselves fit to re ceive It. 

HAWAII. In Hawaii our aim must he to develop the Terri tory on the traditional American lines. We co not wish n region of large estates tilled by cheap labor: we wish a healthy American community of men who themselves till the farms they own. All our legislation for the islands should be shaped with this end in view; the wellbeing of the average homemaker must afford the true test of the healthy development of the islands. The land policy should as nearly as possible he modelled on our h<>m-e stead system. PORTO RICO. Tt is fl pleasure to say that it Is hardly more necessary to report as to Porto RiVo than as to any State or Territory within our continental ilmlts The Island Is thriving as never before, and ii jo being administered efficiently and honestly. Us people are now enjoying liberty and ordrr under the protection of the United States, and upon this fact we congratulate them and ourselves. Their material welfare must be as carefully and jealously considered as the welfare of any other portion of our country. We have given them the great gift of free access for their products to the markets o; the United States. I ask the attention of the Congress to the need of legislation concerning the public lands of Porto Rico. CUBA. In Tuba such progress has been made toward putting the independent government of the island upon a firm footing that before the. present session of the Congress closes this will bo an accomplished fact. Cuba will then start as her own mistress; and to the beautiful Queen of the Antilles, as she unfolds this new page of her destiny, we extend our heartiest greetings and good wishes. Klse where 1 have discussed the question of reciprocity. In the case of Cuba, however, there are weighty reasons of morality and of national Interest why the policy should be held to have a peculiar ap plication, and I most earnestly ask your attention to the wisdom, indeed to the vital need, of provid ing for a substantial reduction In the tariff duties on Cuban Imports into the United States. Cuba has in her constitution affirmed what we desired, that she should stand, in International matters, in closer and more friendly relations with us than with any other power; and we are bound hy every consideration of honor and expediency to pass com mercial measures in the interest of her material wellbeing. THE 

PHILIPPINES. In the Philippines our problem is larger. They are very rich tropical islands, inhabited hy many varying tribes, representing widely different stases of progress toward civUizntion. Our earnest effort is to help these people upward along the stony and difficult path that leads to self-government. We hope to make our administration of th- Islands honorable to our nation by making it of the highest benefit to the* Filipinos themselves; and as an earnest of what we intend to do, we point to what we have don.. Already a greater measure of material prosperity and of governmental honesty and efficiency has 'been attained in the Philippines than ever before In their history. It is no light task for a nation to achieve the temperamental qualities without which the institu tions of free government are but an empty mo-k ery Our people are now- successfully governing themselves, because for nWe than a thousand rears they have been slowly fitting themselves, sometimes consciously, sometimes unconscious^ . toward this end. What has taken us thirty gen erations to achieve, we cannot expect to see an other race accomplish out of hand, especially when large portions of that race start very far behind the point which our ancestors had reached even thirty generations ago. In dealing with the Phllfp pine people we must show both patience and strength, forbearance and steadfast resolution. Our aim is high. We do not desire to do for the island ers merely what has elsewhere been done for tropic peoples by even the best foreign govern ments. We hope to do for them what has never before been done for any people or the tropics-to mnke them fit for self-government after the fashion of the really free nations. History may safely be challenged to show a single instance In which a masterful race such as ours, having been forced by the exigencies of war to take possession of an alien land, has behaved to its inhabitants with the disinterested zeal for their progress that our people have shown 1" the Philippines. To leave the islands at this time would mean that they would fall into a welter of murderous anarchy. Such desertion of duty on our part would be a crime against humanity. The character of Governor Taft and of his associates and subordinates is a proof, if such be needed, of the sincerity of our effort to give the islanders a constantly increasing measure of self-government, exactly as fast as they show themselves tit to exercise it. Since the civil government was estab lished not an appointment has been made in the islands with any reference to considerations of political influence, or to aught else save the fitness of the man and the needs of the service. In our anxiety for the welfare and progress of the Philippines, it may be that here and there we have gone too rapidly in giving them local self government. It Is on this side that our error, if any. has been committed. No competent observer, sincerely desirous of finding out the facts and in fluenced only by a desire for the welfare of the natives, can assert that we have not gone far enough. We have .gone to the very verge of safety In hastening the process. To have taken a single etep further or faster in advance would have been folly and weakness, and might well have been crime. We are extremely anxious that the natives shall show the power of governing themselves. We are anxious, first for their sakes, and next be cause It relieves us of a great burden. There need not be the slightest fear of our not continuing to give them all the, liberty for which they are fit. SELF-GOVERN Th» only fear is lest in our overanxiety we give them a degree of Independence for which they are unfit, thereby Inviting reaction and disaster. As fast as there is any reasonable hope that In a given district the people, can govern themselves, self-government has been given in that district. There is not a locality fitted for self-covernment which has not received It. But it may well be that in certain cases it will have to be withdrawn be cause the Inhabitants show themselves unfit to exorcise It; such Instance* have already occurred. In other words, there Is not the slightest chance- of our falling to show a sufficfently humanitarian spirit. The danger comes in the opposite direction. There are still troub'es ahead in the Islands. The Insurrection has become an affair of local banditti "id marauders, who deserve no higher regard than the brigands of portions or the old World. Encouragement, direct or indirect, to these Insurrectos stands on the «ame footing as en couragement to hostile Indians In the days when we -till had Indian wars. Exactly as our aim is to give to the Indian who remain* peaceful the fullest and amplest consideration, but to have It under stood that we will show no weakness if he goes on the warpath, so we must make it evident, unless ire an false to our own traditions and to the de mands of civilization and humanity, that while we will do everything in our power for tHe Filipino who Is peaceful, we will take the sternest measures with the Filipino who follows the path of the in surrecto and thr- ladrone. The heartiest praise Is due to large numbers of the natives of the Islands for their Steadfast loyalty. The Macnb. have been conspicuous for their courage and devotion to the Hag. I recom mend that the Secretary of War be empowered to take some systematic action In the way of aiding those of these men who are crippled In the service and the families of those who are killed. The time has come when there should be ad ditional legislation for the Philippines. Nothing better can be done for the Islands than to introduce industrial enterprises. Nothing would benefit them bo much as throwing them open to Industrial de velopment. The connection between Idleness and mischief Is proverbial, and the opportunity to do remunerative work is one of the surest preventives of war. Of course, no business man will go into the Philippines unless It is to his Interest to do so; and It is Immensely to the interest of the islands that he should go In. It is therefore necessary that the Congress should pass laws by which the resources of the islands can be developed; so that franchises (for limited terms of years) can be granted to Companies doing business in them, and every encouragement be given to the incoming of business men Of every kind. Not to permit this la to do a wrong: to the Philippines- The franchises must be printed and the business permitted only under regulations which will guarantee the islands against any kind of Improper exploitation. But the vast natural wealth of the inlands must be developed. and the capital willing to develop It must be gfVen the op portunity. The field must be thrown open to in dividual enterprise, -which has been the real factor In the development of every region over which our flap has flown. It Is urgently necessary to enact suitable laws dealing with general transportation, mining, hanking;, currency, homesteads and the use and ownership of the lands and timber. These laws will Rive free play to Industrial enterprise; and the commercial development which will surely follow will afford to the people of the islands the best proofs of the sincerity of our desire to aid them. A 77?. 1 V PA Cl CAB I call your attention most earnestly to tUe cry ing need of a cable to Hawaii and the Philippines, to be continued from the Philippines to points in Asia. We should not defer a day longer than necessary the construction of such a cable. It is demanded not merely for commercial but for politi cal and military considerations. Either the (.'ongress should Immediately provide for the construction of a government cable, or else an arrangement should be made by which like ad vantages to those accruing from a government cable may be secured to the government by con tract with a private cable company. THE ISTHMIAN CANAL. No single great material work which remains to be undertaken on this continent Is of such conse quence to the American people as the building of a canal across ihe isthmJS connecting North and South America. Its importance to the nation Is by no means limited merely to its material effects upon our business prosperity: and yet. with view to these effects aione. It would be to the last degree Important for us Immediately to begin it. While its beneficial effects would perhaps be most marked upon the Parific Coast and the Gulf and South Atlantic States, it would also greatly benefit other sections. It is emphatically a work which it is for the Interest of th© entire country to begin and complete as soon as possible; it is one of those great works which only a great nation can under take with prospects of success, and which when done are not only permanent assets In the nation's material interests, but standing monuments to its constructive ability. 1 am glad to be able to nnnfunee to you that our negotiations on this subject with Great Britain, conducted on both sides in a spirit of friendliness and mutual goodwill and respect, have resulted in my being able to lay before the Senate a treaty which if ratified will enable us to begin prepara tions for an Isthmian canal at any time, and which guarantees to this nation every right that it has ever asked in connection with the canal. In this treaty the old flayton-Bulwer Treaty, so long rec ognized as Inadequate to supply the base for the construction and maintenance of a necessarily American ship canal, is abrogated. It specifically provides that the United States only shall do the work of building and assume the responsibility o safeguarding the canal and shall regulate its neutral use by all nations on terms of equality without the guaranty or interference, of any outside nation from any quarter. The signed treaty will at once be laid before the Senate, and if approved the Con gress can then proceed to give effect to the ad vantages it secures us by providing for the build ing of the canal. The true end of every great and free people should be self-respecting peace; and this nation most ear nestly desires sincer-s and cordial friendship with all others. Over the entire world, of recent years, wars between the great civilized powers have be come less and less frequent. Wars with barbarous or semi-barbarous peoples come In an entirely dif ferent category, being merely a most regrettable hut necessary international police duty which must he performed for the sake of the welfare of man kind. Peace can only be kent with certainty where both sides wish to keep it; but more and more the civilized peoples are realizing the wicked folly of war and are attaining that condition of Just and intelligent regard for the rights of others which will In the end, as we hope and believe, make world wide peace possible. The peace conference at The Hague gave definite expression to this hope and belief and marked a stride toward their attainment. This same peace conference acquiesced in our statement of the Monroe Doctrine as compatible with the purposes and aims of the conference. THE MONROE DOCTRINE. The Monroe Doctrine should be the cardinal feature of the foreign policy of all the nations of the two Americas, as it Is of the United States, .lust seventy-eight years have passed since Presi dent Monroe in his annual message announced that "The American continents are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European power." In other words, the Monroe Doctrine is a declaration that there must be no territorial aggrandizement by any non-American power at the expense of any American power on American soil. It is in no wise Intended as hostile to any nation in the Old World. Still less is it in tended to give cover to any aggression by one New World power at the expense of any other. It is simply a step, and a long step, toward assuring the universal peace of the world by securing the possibility of permanent peace on this hemisphere. During the last century other influences have es tablished the permanence and Independence of th smaller States of Europe. Through the Monroe Doctrine we hope to be able to safeguard like inde pendence and secure like permanence for the lesser among the New "World nations. This doctrine has nothing to do with the com mercial relations of any American power, save that it in truth allows each of them to form such as it desires. In other words, it is really a guaranty of the commercial Independence of the Americas. We do not ask under this doctrine for any exclusive commercial dealings with any other American State. We do not guarantee any State against punishment if it misconducts Itself, provided that punishment does not take the form of the acquisi tion of territory by any non-American power. Our attitude in Cuba is a sufficient guaranty of our own good faith. We have not the slightest desire to secure any territory at the expense of any of our neighbors. We wish to work with them hand in hand, so that all of us may be uplifted together, and we rejoice over the good fortune of any of them, we gladly hail their material pros perity and political stability, and are concerned and alarmefl If any of them fall into industrial or political chaos. We do not wish to see any Old World military power grow up on this continent, or to be compelled to become a military power our selves. The peoples of the Americas can prosper best If left to work out their own salvation In their own way. THE V T. The work of upbuilding the navy must be steadily continued. No one point of our policy, foreign or domestic, is more important than this to the honor and material welfare, and above all to the peace. of our nation in the future. Whether we desire it or not. we must henceforth recognize that we have International duties no less than international rights. Even If our flag were hauled down In the Philippines and Porto Rico, even If we decided not to build the Isthmian canal, we should need ■ thoroughly trained navy of adequate size, or else be prepared definitely and for all time to abandon the Idea that our nation is among those whose sons go down to the sea in ships. Unless our commerce is always to be carried In foreign bottoms we must have war craft to protect It. Inasmuch, however, as the American people have no thought of abandoning the path upon which they have entered, and especially in view of the fact that the building of the isthmian canal is fast becoming one of the matters which the whole people are united In demanding, it is imperative. that our navy should be put and kept in the high est state of efficiency, and should be made to answer to our growing needs. So far from being in any way a provocation to war. an adequate and highly trained navy is the best guaranty against war, the cheapest and most effective peace in surance. The cost of building and maintaining such a navy represents the very lightest premium for insuring peace which this nation' can possibly pay. Probably no other great nation In the world is so anxious for peace as we are. There Is not a slllgVl Civilized power which has anything whatever to fear from aggressiveness on our part. All we want Is peace; and toward this end we wish to be able to secure the same respect for our rights from others which we are eager and anxious to extend to their rights in return, to Insure fair treatment to us commercially, and to guarantee the safety of the American people. ( >ur people intend to abide by the Monroe Doctrine and t" insist upon It as th<- one sure means of Mooring the peace of the Western Hemisphere. The navy offers us the only means of making our insistence upon the Monroe Doctrine anything but a subje.-t of derision t-> whatever nation chooses to disregard it. We desire the peace which comes as of right to the just man armed; not the peace granted on terms "f Ignotalay to the craven and the weakling. It la not possible to improvise a navy after war hr-aks out. The ehlps must be built and the m*S trained long In advance. Some Huxiliary vessels can be turned Into makeshifts which will do in de fault of any better for the minor work, and a pro portion of raw men can be mixed with the highly trained, their shorti-omlt;*?.* being made good by the skill of their fellows; but the efficient fighting force of tho navy when pitted against an equal opponent will be found almost exclusively in the warships that have been regularly built and In the officers and men who through years of faithful per formance of sea duty have been trained to handl" their formidable but complex and delicate weapons with thf highest efficiency. In the late war with Spain the ships that dealt the decisive blows at Manila and Santiago had been launched from two to fourteen years, and they were able to do as they did hecause. the men in the conning towers, the gun turrets and the engiae rooms had through long years of practice at sea learned how to «lo their duty. ITS EARLY STAGES. Our present navy was begun in ISS2. At that period our navy consisted of a collection of anti quated wooden ships, already almost as out of place against modern war vessels as the galleys of Alcibiades and Hamilcar— certainly as the ships of Tromp and Blake. Nor at. that time did we have men fit to handle a modern man-of-war. Under the wise legislation of the Congress and the Successful administration of a succession of patri otic Secretaries of the Navy belonging to both political parties the work of upbuilding the n.ivy went on. and ships equal to any in the world of their kind were continually added; and what was even more important, these ships were exercised at sea singly and In squadrons until the men aboard them were able to get the best possible service out of them. The result was seen in the short war with Spain, which was decided with such rapidity because of the Infinitely greater preparedness of our navy than of the Spanish navy. While awarding the fullest honor to the men who actually commanded and ma:.ned the ships which destroyed the Spanish sea forces in the Philippines ami in Cuba, we must not forget that an equal meed of praise belongs to those without whom neither blow could have been struck. The Con gressmen who voted years in advance the money to lay down the ships, to build the guns, to buy the armor plate; the department official? and the business men and wageworkers who furnished whit the < "ongre.-s had authorized; the Secretaries of the Navy who asked for and expended the p- propriations. and finally the officers who. in fair weather and foul, on actual sea service, trained and disciplined the- crews of the ships when there was no war in sight— are entitled to a fan ■hard in the glory of Manila and Santiago and the respect accorded by every true American to thosa who wrought such signal triumph for our country it was forethought and preparation which secured us the overwhelming triumph of 1333. I* ■«-« »_,*, to show forethought and preparation now, there may come a time when disaster win befall us Instead of triumph: and should this time come th» fault will rest primarily not upon those whom th» accident of events puts in supreme command at the moment, but. upon those who have, failed to prepare in advance. There should be no cessation in the work of com riieting our navy. So far ingenuity has been wholly unable to devise a substitute for the great war craft -whose hammering guns heat out the mastery of the high seas. It is unsafe and unwise not to provide this year for several additional battleships and heavy armored cruisers, with auxiliary 13$ lighter craft in proportion: for the exact number and character I refer you to the report of the Sec retary of the Navy. But there is something w , need even more than additional ships, and this 13 additional officers and men. To provide battl'shtos an.l cruisers and then lay them up. with the ex pectation of leaving them unmanned until they are needed in actual war. would be worse than folly It would be a crime against the nation. 

GUNNERY. To send any warship against a competent enemy unless those aboard It have been trained by years of actual sea service, including incessant gunnery practice, would be to invite not merely disaster, but the bitterest shame and humiliation. Four thousand additional seamen and one thousand additional , marines should be provided: and an increase in the officers should be provided by making a large addi tion to the classes at Annapolis. There is one small matter which should be mentioned in connection with Annapolis. The pretentious and unmeaning title of "naval cadet" should be abolished; the title of "midshipman." full of historic association, should be restored. Even in time of peace a warship should be used until it wears out. for only so can it he kept fit to respond to any emergency. Th- officer? and men alike should be kept as much as possible on bluo water, for it is there only they can learn their duties as they should be learned. The big vesseU should be manoeuvred in squadrons containing not merely battleships, but the necessary proportion of crullers and scouts. The torpedo boats should be handled by the younger officers' in MXi manner is will best fit the latter to take responsibility and meet the emergencies of actual warfare. Every detail ashore which can be performed by a civilian should be so performed, the officer being kept for his special duty in the sea service. Above all. gunnery practice should be unceasing. It Is Im portant to have our navy of adequate size, but It is even more Important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world. This 13 possible only with highly drilled crews and officers, and this in turn Imperatively demands continuous an.l progressive Instruction in target practice, ship handling, squadron tactics and general discipline. Our ships must he assembled in squadrons actively cruising away from harbors and never Ion? at anchor. The resulting wear upon en?ine3 and huil3 must be endured: 8 battleship worn out in lor.? training of officers and men is well paid for by the results, while, on the other hand, no matter in how excellent condition. It is useless if the crew be not expert We now have seventeen battleships appropriated for. of which nine are completed and have been, commissioned for actual service. The remaining eight will be ready In from two to four years, bus it will take at least that time to recruit and train the men to fight them. It is of vast concern that we have trained crews ready for the vessels by th» time they are commissioned. Good ships and good guns are simply good weapons, and the best weapons are useless save in the hands of men who know how to fight them. The men must he trained: and drilled under a thorough and well planned sys tem of progressive Instruction, while the recruiting must b- carried on with still greater vigor. Every effort must be made to exalt the main function of the Officer— the command of men. The leading graduates of the Naval Academy should be as signed to the combatant branches, the line. S3* marines. Many of the essentials of success are already recognized by the general board, which, as the cen tral office of a growing staff, is moving st-adiljr toward ■ proper war efficiency and a proper eSl dency of the whole navy, under the Secretary. This general board, by fostering the creation of * general staff, is providing for the official and then the -eneral recognition of cur altered conditions *3 a nation and of the true meaning of a great war fleet, which meaning is. first, the best men. and. second, the best ships. The naval militia forces are State organisations. an,! are trained for coast service, and in event of war they will constitute the Inner line of defence. They should receive hearty encouragement from the general government. But. 111 addition. we should at once provide tor a national naval reserve, organized and trained L the direction of the Navy Department, and safest to the call of the Chief Executive wh^ rwar becomes imminent. It should be a real «■""£ the naval seagoing peace establishment, and offer material to be drawn on at once for manning our "hips in time of war. It should be composed of graduates of the Naval Academy. graduates ,o! be naval militia, officers and crews of coast line Ttelmer- longshore schooners, fishing vessels and s earn yacht,, together with the coast P*>P»J«JJ about such centres a3 lifesaving stations and Itght- American people must either build and main tain an adequate navy or else make up .the r mind* definitely to accept «, secondary po*i ti on ln^ inter national affairs, not merely in ■^"L^JS me-.iil matters.
