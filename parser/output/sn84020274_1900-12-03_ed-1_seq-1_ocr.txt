Thus there is no treaty now between Nicaragua and the United States on this important question, except the treaty of JS67, which, the State Department admits, must be superseded by a new treaty. The State Department does not propose to make a. treaty with Nicaragua until after the canal bill is a law. Lord Salisbury, however, prefers not to 'wait, nnd If he is successful in negotiating a treaty with Nicaragua as to British rights through Nicaraguan waterways, present and future. Kngland will bo In a splendid tactical po sition. The treaty that will be made by Nic nragua with the United States must of necessity contain no feature that will be a violation of the liritish Nicaragua, treaty. In other words, when Secretary Hay comes to make his treaty with Nicaragua he may lind that country's power so limited by the obligations It has entered Into with Great Britain that we may not obtain an ar rangement to our liking.

Governor McClurg's demise was somewhat of a sur prise, as his son, Joe, who has been his personal attendant constantly for two months, came to town this morning and reported that his father wa better.

Mr. McCIurg was born in St. Louis County on February H. ISIS. Orphaned at an early nge, he was sent, when he was 7 years old. to relatives In I'ittsburg. from wlilcu place ho later went to Ohio and attended Xenla's famous academy and the college at Oxford. Like many other famous Amer icans, he numbered school teaching among his early experiences; It was si brief ex perience with him, however, for at 17 he returned to St. Iuls, and, from 137 to 3S39, served as deputy sheriff, his official position under his uncle.

Cornelius Sullivau Convinced Died in Seattle Is a Brother for Whom He Has Sought Since Coming to America in 1SGG, Efforts to locate relatives of John Sullivan, an aged bachelor who died early last month In Seattle, Wash., have developed facts of family history dating back forty years that convince Cornelius Sullivan of No. 22"l',i Cass avenue that the dead man, who had property worth $300,000, was no other than a brother whose whereabouts have been a mystery slnco the beginning of the Civil War. The unusual tale that emanates from the West regarding the wealthy bachelor and his adventures coincides so generally with Mr. Sullivan's recollections of his long-lost brother that he has decided to make a thor ough investigation. In order to establish a claim to a portion of the estate, and his son, J. J. Sullivan, business manager for a weekly paper, will engage an attorney to endeavor to prove the relationship. Dispatches from Seattle state that John Sullivan left an estate valued at PW.000, of which $150,000 is in money, and that the Probate Court has been attempting to as certain If ho bad any relatives anywhere. Recently a Mrs. Charles Cramer and a Dennis Sullivan, both of Butte, Mont., de clared themselvis to be the sister and nephew of the deceased, and their account proved so plausible that the lawyers are reported disposed to believe them to be rightful heirs. It is upon the story issuing from Butte that Mr. Sullivan bases his claims. The Sullivans living in Butte say that their family came from Becrhaven, Ireland, and that John Sullivan, presumably the wealthy Seattle bachelor, disappeared from home about thirty-five years ago, coming to America. He was shipwrecked off the New foundland coast, but his life was saved and ho settled In Washington. The father of Cornelius Sullivan of this city lived near Becrhaven.

A draft of the doc ununt was pilfered by a British agent from the house of the American Minister at Managua and sent to London. While the slow croc-esses of ibc Semto i were being utilized to make the treaty a . law. the startling news was heard that i Great Britain had hastily concluded a treaty with Nicaragua almost Identical with the one tin- United States desired.

It is pointed out that the British-Niea-rauguan treaty would be valuable to Great Britain if the original IIay-1'auncefote treaty were repudiated and the Hepburn bill, providing for th- fortification of the anal by the eouritr. became a law. What the proposed Brltish-Nicaraguan treaty will contain cannot be told, but it would not be surprising if It contained some ft attires Including a nonfortiticatlon clause that would be pleasing to every Kuropean nation that agrees with Great Britain, that the United States solely should not control mid defend the waterway across the Ameri can isthmus. For Instance. If Nicaragua, in her treaty with Great Britain, should bind herself to not permit the erection of fortifications on her territory, this Government would be face to face with another complication. The Secretary of State signed protocols with Nicaragua and Costa Rica on Satur day revering this ground, anil a similar ar rangement Buy ! made with Colombia. These protocols have not the binding force of treaties, but serve as a preliminary agreement, pmding the execution of actual treaties. law, and was admitted to the bar in 1S10. But. finding the profession uncongenial, he soon abandoned It. and returned to Mis souri. In 1SU came the culmination of his life romance, his marriage to Miss Mary Cath erine Johnson. Miss Johnson was a Vir ginian by birth. When the California gold craze broke out Mr. McCIurg left his mercantile business at Hazlewood and went West. After a lit tle over a year of California life he re turned to Missouri ia l'anama and New York, reaching Hazlewood In June. 1S31. IJnn Creek, on the banks of the CKige, was the scene of his next venture. In Feb ruary, lSoi, he there opened up the large wholesale and retail mercantile establish ment that made of Linn Creek, until the advent of railroad", one of the leading com mercial centers of the State. When the war broke out Mr. McCIurg, though a slave owner, was a strong Union man. His; career as a soldier began in June, 1S61. when he organized the Hickory County Battalion and the 0age Hegiment of Missouri Volunteers, known as the Home Guards, of which he was made Colonel. He resigned in December. ISffl. from the army anil was elected to Congress from the Fifth Missouri District. In 1SS, before the ex piration of his last term as Congressman, he was ohosen Goernor of Missouri, which position he occupied until 1S71.

About fortv-live year ago John left his home to work for a uairyman in Beerhaven. distant about fix miles, several year later departing for tlie United States and going to Lee Countv. Pennsylvania. 'Hie father lay dead when John's first letter was received, containing a remittance. John sent enough money at regular Intervals to bring most of the fam ily to this country. The last heard of him. though, was that he was ready to leave Pennsylvania for New York City. Cornelius Sullivan arrived In Boston in 1S6G. Anxious to learn something of his brothers and sisters, he inserted an ad vertisement in the "Boston Pilot," but no word came. He then went to New York, and twenty-four years ago came to St. Louis. Mr. Sullivan always has fancied that he would hear cf his brother John again, and he always thought the lost brother was rich. He often told his chil dren the circumstances attending John's disappearance, and expressed a faith that the mystery would some day be unraveled. When Mr. Sullivan saw the Seattle and Butte telegrams in The Republic he felt assured that the family residing in Butte Is that of one of, his sisters. Associating his own story wifn that of the Information sent from Butte, he concludes that the dead Seattle bachelor was the brother of whom he had yearned to hear for decades. Resolved to demonstrate the relationship, and thereby become a claimant for part of the estate, he has Instructed his son to gather all the facta for comparison. captured"thousand bolomen Captain Green's Success at Vigan, Island of Luzon.

BY TV. T STEAD. SPKCIAL BV CABLE. London. Dec. 2. (Copyright. 1!"J0. by TV. R. Hearst.) England Is waging a second war in South Africa. According to the statements of her otlicinis. the tirst war waged against Krugerlsm and to establish British paramountcy A'as ended when the two Republics were annexed to the British Kmplre. She is now waging a second war, a war of conquest puie and simple, having as its object the extinction of a nationality, and having as its means the cold-blooded in riictioii of luthless cruelty upon women and children. There has; been nothing like It In Hng llsh history for a. hundred years. It Is a war waged mostly with the torch, nnd nr son is employed as the ehlef means of puc illcatiou. This warfare of savages has been resorted to for mouths, without brlns lng the Invaders' any nearer their goal. The analogy Is very close between the un availing MrUKgle which the forces of Ueorge III kept up with Marlon and his gallant men In the Southern slates last century. DeTVtt Is the Marlon of to-day. and his forces have been swelled by the very means employed to crush out opposi tion. eutrnls I iiprotected. Those Boers who, in reliance upon Brit Mi protection, had given up their arms and had taken the oath of neutrality, found themselves without the protection upon the security of which they hud taken the oath. They had deserted their colors, under the It mptatlon of a promise of protection from the Government which hud annexed their countr . Hardly had thty done so when they found that the BrltNh were utterly unable to save them from punishment from their comrades, who resented their desertion and sent com mando to eorr.pel them to choose between the punishment of deserters or return to tlm colors. Till.), again, repeats almost exactly one of the most famous Incidents In the at tempt made by tieorge HI to repress the so-called lebeilloii, which culminated in the establishment of American Independence. Hence accusations of perjury freely brought against the Boers, who. Ilndlng themselves between the devil and the deep sea, decid eil to rejoin their commandoes rather than expose themselves to the punishment meted out to thote who threw in their lot with the enemies of their country. Tlie root of the whole difficulty lay In the inability of the British to establish ef fective occupation in the territory which they had overrun. They exacted the oath of neutrality without being able to afford the protection which that oath implied. According to article 4j of the Rules of War of Tho Hague convention, any pres sure on tho population of an occupied ter ritory to take the oath to the hostile Pow er Is prohibited, but, Ilndlng himself con fronted by the results of his failure to give protection to those who had sworn to be neutral. Lord Roberts plunged still further In the Illegal direction. Here Is the text of his proclamation: "Whereas. The leniency with which tho burghers have been treated has not been WORST WRECK IN YEARS ON MEXICAN CENTRAL. r.nrrm.ic special. Kl Taso. Tex.. Dec. 2. Details of a disas trous passi-nger and freight train wreck on the Mexican Central Railway, twenty-five miles south of Jlmulco, Mexico, and 4o0 miles distant from El Paso, Friday night, leached here to-day. The soutitound passenger train, while running at full speed, crashed Into the two ensin?s of a double-header freight, coming north. The three cnsine3 ant' many cars were utterly demolished. Eleven passengers are known to have been killed outright, and twenty ethers were seriously injured, some of them fatally. The wreck was one of the most complete on the Mexican Central for years, the three engines being smashed to pieces. A halt dozen cars were piled up in a promiscuous heap and several broken into klndlluj wood. Engineer Ross and Firemen Reeves and Harveson of the freight train were killed, but the engineer and fireman of the pas senger train Jumped In time to save their lives. They fled, it Is said, to avoid arrest for the accident. Most of the passengers killed or injured were Mexicans riding In the cars next the engine. It Is Impassible to B'i a list of the dead VICTIM OF THE TYPEWRITER HABIT. appreciate.!, but has been used as a cloak for continued resistance: and "Whereas, There are no means of dis tinguishing combatants from nonciimba tant.s. all oath breakers will hereafter be punished either by death. line or imprisonment. Further, all burghers liv ing In districts occupied by the British troops, unless they surrender nnd subscribe to the neutrality oath prescribed by me .o meet such cases, will be treated as prisoners of war and will be transported. All build ings which ate uy for ' .rboring B'er stouts will be- razed to the ground." I'r.der the last clause almost any building might be doomed, for the Boer scouts are ubiquitous nnd use an libuse that is handy for shelter. The inmates cannot prevent this any more than they can prevent the billeting of British troops. Itolifrtft'n FvrorlfiuM .Tlcitvure. A gre'at deal has been said concerning the humanity of lyird Roberts. Personally he Is of a benevolent disposition, but as an In vader of the Transvaal, under the cover of one or two benevolent proclamations he has Issued orders which speak for them selves as to the unmitigated ferocity with which this second war Is being waged, and the result of the supreme command which he yields In the Dutch Republics has been to recall the horrors of the Thirty Years War. When he began his inarch to Blocmfou tein be forbade looting, and up to Kroon stadt he appear. to have repressed with a Mt-rn hand any apology on the part of the troops immediately undir his eye. but after Kroonstadt, when the Transvaal was en tered and provision ran short, the Inter dict upon looting, although not formally repealed, was generally disregard! d. General Buller, when he advanced from ir..aiai. was carerm not to move until he ii.iu jiiowocu iu army wiui suiucieni sup plies1 to obviate any ni'cesslty for looting. Lord Roberts was much less particular. The African colonial contingent looted right and left, and the troops, both Brit ish and colonial, made a practice! of de stroying houses on the line of march, sometimes f(,r the sake of obtaining lire wood often for wanton destructheness. WILL .MIT VISIT IICIII.IN. Berlin. Dec. 2. .Mr. Kruger has abandoned his proposed visit to Berlin owing to the receipt of :m official Intimation that Hm peror William regrets that in consequence of previous arrangements ho will be unable to receive him. The Boer statesman will therefore proceed direct from Cologne for HollJiid. He telegraphed to this effect this afternoon. Tho Cologne Gazette. In an Inspired com minltpje, says: "Mr. Kruger's visit Is not agreeable to Germany, his aim being to ob tain Intervention In South Africa. It would be n. grave Jwlitfcal mistake. It would lo even a great crime.to allow him to entertain even a spark of hope that Germany will render him any practical support."
