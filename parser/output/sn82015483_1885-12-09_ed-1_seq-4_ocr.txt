The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of the revenue received by the government, and indirectly paid by the people from customs duties. The ques tion of free trade is not involved, nor is there now any occasion for the general dis cussion of the wisdom or expediency of protective syBtem. Justice and fairness dictate that m any modification of onr present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests which have been enoouraered by such laws, and in 1 which our citizens have large investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroy ed. We should also deal with the subject in such a manner as to protect the interests of American labor, which is the capital of our workingmen; its stabil ity and proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protective pol ioy. Within these limitations a certain reduc tion should be made in our onatoms revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, the inquiry follows, where can It best be remitted and what articles can best be released from duty in the interest of our citizens? I think the reduction should be mads in the revenue derived from a tax upon the im portant necessaries of life. We thus direct ly lessen the cost of living in every family of the land, and release to the people in every humble home a larger measure of the re wards of frugal industry. 

CITIZENSHIP A!f D NATURALIZATION. The inadequacy of. existing legislation touching citizenship and naturalization de mands your consideration. While recognizing the right of expatria tion, no statutory provision exists providing means tor renouncing cicizensnip dv an American citizen, native born or naturalized, ner for terminating and vacating an improp er acquisition of citizenship. Even a fraudu lent decree of naturalization cannot now be canceled. The privilege and franchise of American citizenship should be granted with care, and extended to those only who intend in good faith to assume its duties and respon sibilities when attaining its privileges and benefits; it should be withheld from those who merely go through the forms of naturali zation with the intent of escaping the duties f their original allegiance without taking upon themselves those of their new status, or who may acquire the rights of American citizenship for no other than a hostile pur pose towards their original governments. These evils have had many flagrant illustra tions. I regard with favor the suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors that provision be made for a central bureau of record of the decrees of naturalization grant ed by the various courts throughout the United States now invested with that power. The rights which spring from domicile in the United States, especially when coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citi zen, are worthy of a definition by statute. The stranger ooming hither with intent to remain, establishing his residence in our midst, contributing to the general welfare, and, by his voluntary act, declaring his pur pose to assume toe responsibilities of citizen ship, thereby gains an inchoate status which legislation may properly define. The laws of certain States and territories admit a dom iciled alien to the local franchise, conferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree which places him in the anomalous position of being a citizan of a State and yet not of the United States within the purview of fed eial and international law. It is important within the scope cf national legislation to de fine this right of alien domicile as distin guished from federal naturalization. II SILVXB PROBLEM. Nothing more important itianTTve present condition of our currency and coinage can claim your attention. Since February, 1878, the government has, under the compulsory provisions of law, pur chased silver bullion and coined the aan the rate of .0O?i0U0 eTer7 "oate 215,759,431 silver dollars have been coined. A reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the general government would limit its exercise, without express restrictive words, to the people's needs and the require ments of the public welfare. Upon this theory the authority to "coin money" given to Congress by the constitu tion, if it permits the purchase by the gov ernment of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient circulating medium. The desire to utilize the silver produst of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to the silver currency of the nation as is compelled by the silver coinage act is negatived by the fact that up to the present time only about fifty millions of the silver dollars so coined have actually found their way into circula tion, leaving more than 165,000,000 in the possession of the government, the custody of which has entailed a considerable expense for the construction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are out standing Bilver certificates amounting to about $93,000,000. Every month two millions of gold in the publio treasury are paid out for two millions or more of silver dollars, to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enough this operation will result in the substitution of silver for all the gold the government owns applicable to its general purposes. It will not do to rely upon the customs receipts of the government to make good this drain of gold, because the silver thus coined having been made legal tender for all debts and dues, publio and pri vate, at times during the last six months 58 per cent, of the receipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates, while the aver age within that period has been 0 per cent. The proportion of silver and its certificates will probably increase as time goes on, for the reason that the nearer the period ap proaches when it will be obliged to offer sil ver in payment of its obligations, the greater inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation in the value of silver or for the purpose of speculating. This hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time comes that gold has been withdrawn from circulation then will be ap parent the difference between the real value of the silver dollar and a dollar in gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold, still toe stanaaru oi value ana necessary in our dealings with other countries, will be at a premium over silver; banks which have sub stituted gold for the deposits of their cus tomers may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome profit; rich speculators will sell their hoard ed gold to their neighbors, who need it to li quidate their foreign debts, at a ruinous pre mium over silver, and the laboring men and women of the land, most defenseless of all, will find that the dollar received for the wage of their toil has sadly shrunk in its purchas ing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary and that nlti mately the price of labor will be adjusted to the change; out even it this takes place the wage worker cannot possibly gain, bnt must inevitably lose, since the price he is compel led to pay for his living will not only be measured in a coin heavily depreoited and fluctuating and uncertain in its value, bnt this uncertainty in the valne of the purchas ing medium will be made the pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by ac tual depreciation. The words nttered in 1834 by Daniel Web ster in the Senate of the United States are true to-day: "The very man of all others who - has the deepest interest in a sound currency and who suffers most by mischievous legisla tion in money matters is the man who earns ' his daily bread by his daily toil." The most distinguished advocate of bimet allism, discussing our silver coinage, has lately written: "No American citizen's hand has yet felt the sensation of cheapness, either in receiv ing or expending the silver act dollars." And those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheap ness. However plenty silver dollars may be come, they will not be distributed as gifts among the people, and if the laboring man should receive four depreciated dollars where ha now receives but two he will pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pays for all the necessaries and com forts of life. Those who do not fear any disastrous con sequences arising from the continued com pulsory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and who suppose that the addition to the currency of the country intended as its result will be a public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates that the point is easily reached, in the attempt to float at the same time two sorts of money of . different excel lence, when the better will cease to be In general circulation. The hoarding of gold, which has already taken place, indicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such eases.- So If this silver coinage be con tinued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field f circulation to silver alone. This, of course, , must produce a severe contraction of our cir culating medium instead of adding to it. It will not be disputed that any attempt on the part of the government to cause the circulation of silver dollars worth eighty cents, side by side with gold dollars worth one hundred cents, even within the limit that legislation does not run counter to the laws of trade, to be . successful, must be sec onded by the confidence of the people that both coins will retain the same purchasing power and be interchangeable at will. A special effort has been made by the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the amount of our silver coin in circulation; but the fact that a large share of the limited amount thus put out has soon returned to the publio treasury in payment of duties leads to the belief that tho people do not now desire to keep it in hand; and this, with the evident disposition to hoard gold, gives rise to the suspioion that there already exists a lack of confidence among the people touching our financial pro cesses. There is certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness; and the whole amount coined and now on hand might, after a time, be absorbed by the peo ple without apprehension; but it is the cease less stream that threatens to overflow the land which causes fear and uncertainty. What has been thus far submitted upon this subject relates almost entirely to con siderations of a home nature, unconnected with the bearing which the policies of other nations have upon the question. But it is perfectly apparent that a line of action in re gard to our ourrency cannot wisely be settled upon or persisted in, without considering the attitude on the subject of other countries with whom we maintain intercourse through commerce, trade and travel. An acknowl edgment of this fact is found in the act by virtue of which our Bilver is compulsorily coined. It provides that "the President shall invite the governments of the countries composing the Latin Union, so" called, and of snob, other European nations as he may deem advisable, to join the United States in a conference to adopt a common ratio be tween gold and silver for the purpose of es tablishing internationally the use of bime tallio money and securing fixity of relative value between these metals." This conference absolutely failed, and a similar fate has awaited all subsequent ef fort in the same direction. And still we con tinue our coinage of silver at a ratio differ ent from that of any other nation. The most rital part of the silver-coinage act remains inoperative and, unexecuted, and without any nlly or friend, we battle upon the silver field ia an illogical and losing contest. To give full effect to the design of Con gress on this subject I have made careful and earnest endeavor since the adjournment of the last Congress. To this end I delegated a gentleman well instructed in fiscal seience-to proceed to the financial centers of Europe, and, in conjunc tion with our ministers in England, France and Germany, to obtain a full knowledge of the attitude and intent of those governments in respect of the establishment of such an international ratio as would procure free joissge of both metals at the mints of those countries and our own. By my direction, our consul-general at Paris has given close attention to the proceedings of the congress of the Latin Union, in order to indicate our interest in its objects and report its action. It may be said, in brief, as the result of these efforts, that the attitude of the leading powers remains substantially nncnangea since the monetary conference of 1881, nor is it to be questioned that the views of these governments are in each instance supported by the weight ot public opinion. The steps thus taKen nave tnereiore oniy more fully demonstrated the uselessness of further attempts at present, to arrive at any agreement ou the subject with other nations. In the mean time we are accumulating sil ver coin, based upon our own peculiar ratio, to such an extent, and assuming so heavy a burden to be provided for in any internation al negotiations, as will render us an unde sirable party to any future monetary confer ence of nations. It is a significant fact that four of the five countries composing the Latin Union men tioned in onr coinage act, embarrassed with their silver currency, have lust completed an agreement among themselves that no more Uver shall be coined by their respective gov- srnmenta, and that suoh as has been already coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of its coinage. The resort to this expedient by these countries may well .arrest the attention of those who suppose that we can succeed . without shock or injury, in the attempt to circulate upon its merits, all the silver we may T coin " under the provisions of our silver coinage act. The condition in which our treasury may be placed by a persistence in our present course is a matter of concern to every pa teoUo mi tlmmrx who (tvf no. doelra 1.1. ' for- ernment to pay in silver such of its obliga tions as should be paid in gold. Nor should our condition be such as to oblige us, in a prudent management of our affairs, to dis continue the calling in and payment of interest-bearing obligations which we have the right now to discharge and thus avoid the payment of further interest thereon. The so-called debtor class, for whose bene fit the continued compulsory coinage of sil ver is insisted upon, are not dishonest because they are in debt: and they should not be suspected of a desire to jeopardize the finan cial safety of the country, in order that they may cancel their present debts by paying the same in depreciated dollars. Nor should it be forgotten that it is not the rich nor the money-lender alone that must submit to such a readjustment, enforced by the government and their debtors. The pittance of the widow and the orphan and the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be dis astrously reduced. The depositors in sav ings banks and in other institutions which hold in truet the savings of the poor, when their little accumulations are scaled down to meet the new order of things, would, in their distress, painfully realize the delusion of the promise made to them that plentiful money would improve their condition. We have now on hand all the silver dollars necessary to supply the present needs of the people and to satisfy those who from senti ment wish to see them in circulation; and if their coinage is suspended they can be readi ly obtained by all who desire them. If the need of more is at any time apparent their coinage may be renewed. That disaster has not already overtaken ns furnishes no proof that danger does not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. We have been saved by the most careful management and unusual expedients, by a combination of fortunate conditions, and by a confident expectation that the course of the government in regard to silver coinage would be speedily changed by the action of Congress. Prosperity hesitates upon our threshold be cause of the dangers and uncertainties sur rounding this question. Capital timidly shrinks from trade, and investors are unwill- ! ing to take the chanoe of the questionable j shape in which the money will be returned to them, while enterprise halts at a risk against which care and sagacious manage ment do not protect. As a necessary consequence labor lacks employment, and suffering and distress are visited upon a portion of our fellow-citizens especially entitled to the careful considera tion ot those charged with the duties of legis lation. No interest appeals to us so strongly for a safe and stable currency as the vast army of the unemployed. I recommend the suspension of the com pulsory coinage of silver dollars directed by the law passed in February, 1878. The reports of various departments are next considered .and the following recom mendation is made concerning THE 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. The condition of business in the courts of the United States is such that there seems to be an imperative necessity for remedial legis lation on the subject. Some of these oourts are so overburdened with pending causes that the delays in determining litigation amount often to a denial of justice. Among the plana suggested for relief is one by the Attorney General. Its main features are: The transfer of all the original jurisdietion of the Circuit courts to the District courts and an increase of judges for the latter where neces sary; an addition of judges to the Circuit oourts and - constituting them exclusively courts of appeal and reasonably limiting ap peals thereto; further restriction of the right to remove causes from the State to federal oourts; permitting appeals to the Supreme court from the oourts of the District of Col umbia and the territories only in the same cases as they are allowed from State court, and guarding against an unnecessary number of appeals from the Circuit oourts. I approve the p'an thus outlined, and rec ommend the legislation necessary for its ap plication to our judicial system. THS INDIAN PROBLEM is fully discussed and the following recom mendation is made: I recommend the passage of a law author izing the appointment of six commissioners, three of whom shall be detailed from the army, to be charged with the duty of a care ful inspection from time to time of all the Indians upon our reservations or subject to the oar and control of the government, with a view of discovering their exact condition and needs, and determining what steps shall bs taken on behalf of the government to im prove their situation in the direction of their self-support and complete civilization; that they ascertain from such inspection what, if any, of the reservations may be reduced in area, and in such cases what part, not needed for Indian occupation, may be purchased by the government from the Indians, and dis posed of for their benefit; what, if any, In dians, may, with their consent, be removed to other reservations j with a view of their concentration arid the sale on their behalf of their abandoned reservations; what Indian lands now held in common should be allot ted ia severalty; in what manner and to what extent the Indians upon the reservations ' oan be placed under the protection of onr ' laws and oubjeot to their penalties; and which, if any, Indians should be invested with the right of citizenship. The powers and functious of the commissioners in regard to these subjects should be clearly defined,' though they should, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Interior, be given all the authority to deal definitely with the ques tions presented, deemed safe and consis tent. They should be also charged with the duty of ascertaining the Indians who might prop erly be furnished with implements of agri culture, and of what kind; in what oases the snpport of the government should be with drawn; where the present plan of distribut ing Indian supplies should be changed; where schools may be established and where discontinued; the conduct, method and fit ness of agents in charge of reservations; the extent to which such reservations are occu pied or intruded upon by unauthorized per uons;and generally all matters relating to the welfare and improvement of the Indian. They should advise with the Secretary of the Interior concerning these matters of de tail in management, and he should be given power to deal with them fully, if he is not now invested with such power. This plan contemplates the selection of persons for commissioners who are interest ed in the Indian question, and who have practical ideas upon the subject of their treatment. THE 

PUBLIC LANDS. - It is not for the "common benefit of the United States" that a large area of the pub lio lands should be acquired, directly or through fraud, in the hands of a single in dividual. The nation's strength is in the people. The nation's prosperity is in their prosperity. The nation's glory is in the equality of her justiee. The nation's per petuity is in the patriotism of all her people Honce, as far as practicable, the plan adopted in the disposal of the publio lands should have in view the original policy, which encouraged many purchasers of these lands for homes and discouraged the massing of large areas. Exclusive of Alaska, about three-fifths of the national domain has been sold or subjected to contract or grant. Of the remaining two-fifths a considerable por tion is either mountain or desert. A rapidly increasing population creates a growing de mand for homes, and the accumulation of wealth inspires an eager competition to ob tain the public land for speculative purposes. In the future this collision of interests will be more marked than in the past, and the ex ecution of the nation's trust iu behalf of our settlers will be more difficult. I therefore commend to your attention the recommen dations contained in the report of the Secre tary ot the Interior with reference to the re peal and modification of certain of our land laws. The nation has made princely grants and subsidies to a system of railroads projeoted as threat national highways to connect the Pa cific States with the East. It has been charged that these donations from the people have" been diverted to private gain and cor rupt uses, and thus public indignation has been aroused and suspicions engendered. Our great nation does not begrudge its gen erosity, but it abhors peculation and fraud; and the favorable regard of our people for the great corporations to which these grants were made can only be revived by a restora tion of confidence, to be secured by their constant, unequivocal fand clearly mani fested integrity. A faithful application of the undiminished proceeds of the grants to the construction and perfecting of their roads, an honest discharge of their obliga tions, and entire justice to all the people in she enjoyment of their rights on these high ways of travel, it all the public asks, and it will be content with no less. To secure these things should be the common purpose of the officers of the government, as well as of the corporations. With this accomplish ment, prosperity would be permanently se cured to the roads, and national pride would take the place of national complaint. UTAH. In the territory of Utah the law of the United States passed for the suppression of polygamy has been energetically and faith fully executed during the past year, with measurably good results. A number of con victions have been secured for unlawful co habitation, and in some cases pleas of guilty have been entered and a slight punishment imposed, upon a promise by the acensed that they would not again offend against the law, nor advise, counsel, aid, or abet, in any way, its violation by others. The Utah commissioners express the opin ion, baaed upon each information as they are able to obtain, that but few polygamous mar riages have taken place in the territory dur ing the last year. They further report that while there cannot be ionnd upon trie regis- rt ion Itmtm ett voter, ths mmA Of a man actuallv guilty of polygamy, ana wiiuo nuut of that" class are holding office, yet at the last election in the territory, all the officers elected except in one county were men who, though not actually living in the practice of polygamy, subscribe to the doctrine of polygamous marriage as a divine revelation and a law unto all, higher and mere binding upon the conscience than any human law, local or national. Thus is the strange specta cle presented of a community protected by a republican form of government, to which they owe allegiance, sustaining by their suf frages a principle and a belief which sets at naught that obligation of absolute obedience to the law of the land which lies at the foundation of republican institutions. The strength, the perpetuity, and the des tiny of the nation lest npou our homes, es tablished by the law of God, guarded by parental authority, and sanctified by parental love. These are not the homes of polygamy. The mothers of our land, who rule the nation as they mould the characters and guide the actions of their sons, live according to God's holy ordinances, and each, secure and happy in the exclusive love of the father of her children, sheds the warm light of true womanhood, unperverted and unpolluted, up on all within her pure and wholesome family circle. These are not the cheerless, crushed, and unwomanly mothers of polygamy. The fathers of our families are the best citizens of the republic. Wife and children are the sources of patriotism, and conjugal and parental affection beget devotion to the country. The . man who, undented with plural marriage, is surrounded in his single home with his wife and children, has a stake in the coantry which inspires him with re spect for its laws and courage for its defence. These are not the fathers of polygamous families. There is no feature of this practice, or the practice which sanctions it, which is not op posed to all that is of value to our institu tions. There should be no relaxation in the firm but just execution of the law now in opera tion, and I should be glad to approve such discreet legislation as will rid the country of this blot upon its fair fame. Since the people upholding polygamy in our territories are reinforced by immigration from other lands, I -recommend that a law be passed te prevent the importation of Mormons into the country. THE CIVIL SERVICE. The remaining most notable subject dis cussed in the message is the oivil service. On this point the President says: The report of the civil service commission, which will be submitted, contains an account of the manner in which the civil servioe law has been executed during the last year and much valuable information on this important subject. I am inclined to think that there is no sen timent more general in the minds of the peo ple of the conntry than a conviction of the correctness of the principle upon which the law enforcing civil service reform ia based. In its present condition the law regulates only a part of the subordinate pnblic posi tions throughout the country. It applies the test of fitness to applicants for these places by means of a competitive examination and gives large discretion to the commissioners as to the character of the examination and many other matters connected with its execu tion. Thus the rules and regulations adopted by the commission have much to do with the practical usefulness of the statute and with the results of its application. The people may well trust the commis sion to execute the law with perfect fairness and with as little irritation as is possible. Bnt of course no relaxation of the principle which underlies it, and no weakening of the safeguards which surround it, can be expect ed. Experience in its administration will probably suggest amendment of the meth ods of its execution, but I venture to hope that we shall never again be remitted to the system whioh distributes publio positions purely as rewards for partisan service. Doubts may well be entertained whether our government could survive the strain of a continuance of the system whioh, upon every change of administration, inspires an immense army of claimants for offioe to lay siege to the patronage of government, en grossing the time of pnblic officers with their importunities, spreading- abroad the contagion of their disappointment, and fill ing the air with the tumult of their discon tent. The allurements of an immense number of offices and places exhibited to the voters of the land, and the promise of their bestowal in recognition of partisan activity, debauch the suffrage and rob political action of its thoughtful and deliberative character. The evil would increase with the multiplication of offices -consequent upon our extension, and the mania for officeholding growing from its indulgence would pervade our pop ulation so generally that patriotio purpose, the support of principle, the desire for the publio good and solicitude for the nation's welfare would be nearly banished from the activity of our party contests and cause them to degenerate into ignoble, selfish and dis graceful struggles for the possession of office i and vmKltn rl and . . -. Uivil service reform enforced by law earn none too soon to check the progress of demor alization. .- One of its effects, not enough regarded, is the freedom it brings to the political action of those conservative and sober men who, in fear of the confusion and risk attending an arbitrary and sudden change in all the publio offices with a change of party rule, cast their ballots against such a chance. Parties seem to be necessary and will long continue to exist; nor can it now be denied that there are legitimate advantages, not dis connected with office-holding, which follow party supremacy. While partisanship con tinues . bitter and pronounced and sup plies so mnoh of motive to sentiment and action, it is not fair to hold pub lic officials, in charge of important trusts, responsible for the ' best re sults in the performance of their duties,- and yet insist that they shall rely, in confidential and important places, upon the work of those not only opposed to them in political affilia tion, but so steeped in partisan prejudice and rancor that they have no loyalty to their chiefs and no desire for their success. Civil service reform does not exact-' this, nor does it "require that those in subordinate positions who fail in yielding their best service, or who arc incom petent,should be retained simply because they are in place. The whining of a clerk dis charged for indolence or incompetency, who, though he gained his place by the worst pos sible operation of the spoils system, suddenly discovers that he is entitled to protection under the sanction of civil service reform, represents an idea no less absurd than the clamor of the applicant who claims the vacant position as .his compensation for the most questionable party work. The civil service law does not prevent the discharge of the indolent or incompetent clerk, but it does prevent supplying his place with the unfit party worker. Thus, in both these phases, is seen the benefit to the publio service. And the people who desire good government, having secured this statute, will not relinquish its benefits without protest. Nor are they unmindful of the fact that its full advantages can only be gained through the complete good faith of those having its execution in charge. And this they will in sist upon. I reoommend that the salaries of the civil service commissioners be increased to a sum more nearly commensurate to their important duties. A Little Easter. Ex-Eepresentative F. D.

A Drop la Western Union Lackawan na the Feature ot the Closlne Deal ings Prices make a Decline Which ic Recovered Xoward the End When Values Rule at a SHtini Advance. New York. Dec 8, 1835. Western Union was the special feature of the doings on the Exchange this morning. The stock was freely offered (or sale and declined steadily during the first hour. The selling was attributed to the general belief that the quarterly dividend due to-day would bs reduced from 1V6 per cent. Thirty three thousand shares of this stock was sold in the two hours to noon. The weakness of Western Un ion adversely effected the whole market during the first hour and prices advanced fractionally in sym pathy. The decliue in Western Union was 1H af ler 11 o'clock. Western Union recovered 1 per cent, of the early decline on a dedal of the reports that the dividend would be decreased, if any of tho oth er stocks also recovered, but at ls:30 fully two thirds of the list showed declines of H to per cent. The salsa of the morning amounted to 143, 000 shares. The market became weak toward 1 o'clock and further declined a fraction in the hour to I o'clock on a small volume of business. The lowest prices of the day were current at- 2 o'clock, but in the last hour the early sellers recovered briskly and the decline was fully recovered under their purchases. The best prices of the day were made in the final transactions. Lackawanna was the feature of the last hour. As compared with last night's figures prices were up H to l?fc percent. The specialties were without important feature. The sales aggregated SoC,256 shares. Money closed easy at 1 a per cent Exchange closed firmer and higher. Posted rates 4.b4H-oT.
