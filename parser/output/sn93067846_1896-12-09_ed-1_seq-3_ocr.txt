Messrs. Evans and Thomas of the Railroad Commission are at logger heads and before they have finished taking the pabilo into their confidence much that has heretofore heen kept bidden will be divulged. Such family rows are interesting, and, occasionally, profitable since the public sometimes receive benefits not intended Senator Tillman has lost hie faculty of more than fulfilling the expectations of his friends. He was invited to Gaffney City on Saturday to make a speech in favor of the proposed new county. Instead o? delivering an uncompromising and virile new county speech, he was mere ly conservatively pro-new county. The result seems to have been that his friends among the new county people, who had brought him in as a trump card, are thoroughly % disappointed, while those who do not favor the new county think that be . was interfering with a matter that did not concern him at all. Since the sensational election last summer Senator Tillman has not held so firm a grip on the people, who bave begun to tire of dictation. . Secretary Olney has grown to be al most as big as Grover Cleveland him self and has a say-so in everything that is going.

An Extraordinary Report by the Secretary of State. \ Washington, Dec. 7 ?For the first j time within the memory of old officials, j the Secretary of State has made a regu-J lar report to the President for trans mission to Congress, like the reports of other officials of the Cabinet. This re port was laid before Congress to-day as an appendix to the President's message. It treats of many details of American relations during the past year with for eign governments that either were not touched open at all in the message or were more briefly treated Under the head of Spain, Secretary Olney bas much to say in reference to Cuba, and in his reports he sets out in great detail the history of the growth of the rebellion, the present evil state of affairs on the island and other facts upon which the President bases bis broad statements and conclusions. No reference is made to a report from Con sul General Lee, but the Secretary inti mates that his information comes prin cipally from tho United States Consuls, so must be regarded as confidential as to its source. The Secretary's estimate of the present situation is disclosed in a paragraph made after a preliminary statement of the destruction of the in dustrial resources of Cuba, saying : "From whatever point of view we re gard the matter, it is impossible not to discern that a state of things exists at j our doors alike dacgerous to good rela tions, destructive of legitimate com merce, fatal to the internal resources of Cuba and most vexatious and trying be cause entailing upon this government excessive burdens in its domestic admin istration and in its outward relations. This situation cannot indefinitely con tinue without growing still worse, and the time may not be far distant when the United States must seriously consid er whether its rights and interests as well as its international duties, in view of its peculiar relations to the island, do not call for some decided change in the policy hitherto pursued." To begin, with, the Secretary makes] it plain that the present insurrection is far more formidable than the famous j "ten y?>ar3 insurrection," which began at Yara io 1868. He says that, start- i ing in the same portion of the island, ! it very early took proportions beyood its predecessor and there was assumed an aggressive nh-ise. Passing the de fensive lines of trochas, traversing the island from Nona to South, formidable bodies of the revolutionary forces early in the year established themselves in j the rich sugr.r planting districts of j Santa C'ara, Cienfugos and Matanzas, j made hostile forays almost in sight of Habana itself, aud, advancing West ward, effected a lodgment in the fertile tobacco fie'ds, of Pinar del Rio, which has so far resisted all efforts of the Spanish forces to ovetcome. The Sec retary says that while no prominent seaport bas been attacked by the insur gents, a iar'*e oirt of the 2,200 miles of seacoast is practically in their hands, and from its rugged and wild charac- j ter is peculiarly fitted for guerrilla war-j fare aod affords means of receiving ! clandestine supplies of men and arms. Beariog upon the question of recog nition of the insurgents, probably soon ; to oome before Congress in some shape, ? Secretary Oioey says : "So far as our information show*. ? there ?3 no? only no effective local gov- ! eromeot by the insurgents in rhe terri- j tories they overrun, but there is not j even a tangible pr?teuse to establish ad- j ministration anywhere. Their organi zation, confined to the shifting exigen cies of tho miiijary operations of the j hour, is nomadic, without definite j toentres and lacking the most elementary ^atures of municipal government, ^ jere nowhere appears the nucleus of s^tebood." . j /The Secretary illustrates hie point as t/v thfr irrpunoneibtlitv of the inaugenla Stores Will Probably be Closed Two Days. . There has been some talk of making an ef f'or to tod ace the business raen of the city to suspend ali business on Saturday, December 26th, as well as on Chiristmas day. Some years ago when Christmas hap pened to fill on Friday all stores were i-losed both Friday and Saturday and everybody enjoyed a season of Christmas rest and good cheer tost is still recollected with pleasure. There is no reason wby business should net be suspended for two days, for it will be admitted by all well informed persous that little or do business will be transacted on the day following Christmas, and all workingmeu will enjoy the day of rest. It is a good ide* and it should be taken up and put into executioa [A partial canvass of the city has been made and about twenty firms bare expressed a willingness to close their stores bcth days.] by citiog their destruction of American plantations and oppressions of Amer ican planters who grind cane, which be characterizes as acts of aoarchy.. Oo the other baud, he shows that m . the capital cities and ail parts of the island wiih which the United States or its cit izens maintain legitimate normal inter course the Spanish power is supreme, though often exercised in a vexations and arbitrary way, calling for just re monstrances, and most of the fuoctioos of government proceeds as in time of peace. Reccrring to his comparison of this insurrection with those that bave preceded it. Secretary Olney makes this significant statement : ' From every accesible' indication it is clear that the present rebellion is on a far more formidable scale as to num bers, intelligence and representative features than aoy os the preceding re volts of this century; that the'corres ponding effort of Spain for. its repres sion has Jbeeo enormously augmented; and that despite the coustant influx of fresh armies and materials of war from the metropelis, the rebellion, after nearly two years of successful re sistance, appears to day to be in a con. dition to indefinitely prolong the con test on its present lines." He also compliments the tactical ! skill displayed ly tbe leaders of the I insurrectiou. "The insurgent amies," j says tbe Secretary, "feiny represent! the intelligent aspirations of a large j proportion of the peop'e of the whole island; and it is shown that they pur pose to wage this contest on these bet ter grounds of vantage to the end, and to make the present straggle a soprerae test of the capacity of tbe Cuban people to win for themselves and their children the heritage of self-government.1' The Secretary speaks of the appall ing phases of tbe struggle, such as often appears in contests among tbe Latin races of the Western hemisphere; of the excess and forcefol and arbitrary acts of the military; of the ravagiog of privare property, the violation of civili zed warfare by irresponsible officials, and the killing of non-combatants, in some instances, happily few, of Amer ican citizens. Mr. P. S. Thomas Attemps Suicide The Florence correspondent of tbe News and Courier has the following to say in refer ence to Mr. Thomas' attempt to suicide: Florence, December, 4.?Mr. F. S. Thomas in a fit of mental aberration attempted to j coinjr.it suicide yesterd-iy by cutting: his throat with a pocket-knife. The csuse is at- j tributed to drink. Yesterday morning Mr. Themas in sn in- j toxicated condition went uoseen into the j front room of his house and locked it up se- j curely. short while afterwards his wife became aware of what he had doue, becom- ! ing alarmed, sent in haste to the shop3 for j assistance, Mr J. J. Brown responded, but j thinking it unwise to break in alone upon j a man armed p.nd in a demented condition Bent for further assistance. Two other gen | tlemeo came, and the three burst open the door. They found Mr. Thomas lying upon the floor apparenti dead, with a knife ly ing by his side?. Upon investigation it was found that he had cut a gash in tbe lett side of his throat, but had fallen asleep before finishing the intended crime. After some trouble be was aroused from his deep sleep, aod became deeply offended at the iutrusiou of this three friends. After hiding his kr.ife and razor and unloading his pistol these gentlemen returned to their work. In a few minutes they were again summoned, tbe messenger statine that Mr. Thomas was in another rage looking over tbe house for some thing to kill himself with. He was soon I brought to his senses and no more trouble I resulted: Tbe gash in the throat of tbe unfortunate ! man proved to be not 3erious. He is at v.ork j to-day, nod is very much mortified because i of bis bebivior yesterday. This is second or third time he has attempted to commit | suicide Mr. Thomas removed to Florence some I years ago, nnd has made many friend dur- ! ing his stay here. His fellow laborers and : frietds generally deplore the sad event. Mayesville ?Tews.
