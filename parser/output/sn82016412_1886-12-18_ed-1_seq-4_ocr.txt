The flnauctal condition of tho Kingdom of Hawaii is a mattor to tthlch tho United States cannot alford lo Iju indifferent. When the Legislature met on the Jllst March last, the Minister of Finance report ed that the public debt, tthich had been $898,800 on the 31st March, 1881, had increased to S1,0G5,GU0 on the 31st Mutch, 1880. There is ii'iisoti to belioe that this statement was not absolutely conect, and that it (lid not take into account a num ber of open accounts for which the royal Treasury was liable. It is slated on tjood authority that the debt is nearer ? 1,300.000 than $1,0135,000. A considerable por tion of this, represented by notes of hand and bonds, bears 1) per cent interest. On top of this, the Legis lattuo authoiized a two million loan to bu negotiated in England, lo be secured by a pledge of the revenues of the Hawaiian Kingdom. When the Act authorizing this loan was passed, holdeis of over-due bonds and notes of the Government pre sented them to the Treasury for payment. They wcic told there were no assets available for the pui posc, and it was intimated that as to the bonds, the piesent Government, which has just taken ofllcc, was con sidering the propriety of denying their legality, on the ground that the Administration which had issued them had exceeded its powers. Meanwhile an agent had gone to Kngland to try and float the new loan. A serious complication may grow out of these ciicumstances. The public levcnues of the islands will piobably fall short of the appropria tions by not less than $1,250,000 in the biennial peiiod of 1880-1888. It seems hardly possible that Ha waii can meet the interest on the new bonds, if they arc negotiated. If the bonds are sold to Englishmen and default is made in the payment of coupons, pressure will.be brought to bear on the British Government to interfere on behalf of tho credi tors. If at that time the Govern ment of Great Biitain happens to be in prudent hands, the application will be fruitless, for no wise miuis ter would wantonly take a step which would strain our lclations with England to a snapping point. But if the Jingoes should chance lo be in power at the time, it is possi ble that some such light-weight statesman as Randolph Churchill might try to divert attention from domestic troubles by getting up a iluiry with this country over a Biitish annexation of the islands. The worst of these cases is that no one can foresee what incidents may occur to aggravate them. News that an English man-of-war had sailed to Hawaii, and demanded payment of certain coupons under a tlu'eat of occupying one or moieof the islands, would lead to such an explosion of fury in this country that jt might be difficult to prevent the depaiture of filibustering expc ditions. Thus the two nations might be set by the ears through the rash ness ot ambitious oiilceis or irre sponsible adventuiers. It is unfor tunate that the Kingdom ot Hawaii should, at this crisis, be on its last legs financially, politically and morally. Any day we may hear of a revolution and of the overthrow of the King. Twice during the last session of the Legislature his Min istry resigned, and one after an other all his white friends and coun selors seem lo have deserted him. An early revolution would of course be fatal to any linancial negotiation in London. But if the bonds were negotiated first, and tho revolution came afterwards, thero might be some apparent excuse for foreign in tervention on the ground that it was required in the interests of peace, order and civilization. Perhaps it might be worth' the while of Secretary Bayard to call the attention of Minister Phelps to the case. It is out of the power of an English ministry lo prevent Englishmen fiom investing their money as they sec lit. But an au thoiilative declaration from the Bri tish Government that under no cir cumstances would it interfere to collect debts due to Englishmen by the Hawaiian Government would at any rate bo an indication of a proper legard for American feelings and American lights. And simultane ously, it might not bo out of tho way for Mr. Cleveland's Adminis tration to begin to consider what policy they would pursue if such a tiling should occur as the collapse of the Hawaiian Kingdom. S, V. Bulletin, December 2nd. SAMOA. Civil perturbations in the Samoan Islands have, dining the past few years, been a source of considerable embarrassment to tho three govern ments Germany, Great Biitain and the United States whose relations and extia-territorial rights in that important group aro guaranteed by treaties. The weakness of tho native administration and tho conllict of opposing interests in tho islands have led King Malietoa to seek alliance or protection in some ono quarter; re gardless of the distinct engagements whereby no ono of tho three treaty powers may acquire any paramount or exclusive interest. In May last Malietoa oifcrcd to put Samoa under the piotcction of the United States, and tho late Consul, without author ity, assumed to grant it. Tho pio cccdlng was promptly disavowed, and the overzonlous oflicial recalled. Special agents of the three govern ments have been deputed to cxamino tho situation in tho islands. With a change in the representation of all threo powers and an harmonious understanding between them, tho peace and prosperity and the auton omous administration and uculialily of Samoa can haidly fail to be secured. The President's message. THlfsmpniArLWAY. Pittsburg, December 5th. Jame9 B. Eads, who ii visiting friends here, stated to a reporter to-day that gentlemen interested in a scheme lo shorten tho distance be tween the Atlantic and PaciRc. Coasts of North America by means of a ship railway across the Isthmus of Teliaimtepec, had decided to abandon the acceptance of Govern mental aid trammeled by Govern ment restrictions. The company has concluded to form a private cor poration. Vor means to carry the immense enterprise to a successful 'termination, an appeal for linancial aid will be made to all tho great money ccntcis of the world. The Ship Railway Company will be inter national in its scope and internation al in its membership. At the com ing session of Congress that body will be asked to charter a new or ganization, when the process of se curing money will be pushed with energy. THE
