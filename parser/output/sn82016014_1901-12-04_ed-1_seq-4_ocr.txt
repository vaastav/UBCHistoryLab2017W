Dnnraii'a first message to f ICOIUCUi IIV.'I . . w - - 1 utoiv trt stand for some irr, o marker denoting the begin ning of a new fashion in matters of tto vtni TMsree-arding the recommen dations of his cabinet and permitting them to Btand on their merits he said to congress what he had to say and on his own responsibility. What he con siders important public questions nave been, for the most part, treated I mn of the president's known cbarac- be exneeted to treat them in a plain straightforward manner. It was a fitting occasion for pro nouncing a eulogium upon the life and nerviees of his predecessor ana oMnt made it the basis for some vigorous recommendations on the sub i.rf nf unarrhv and anarchists. One of the first matters taken up Is that of the trusts. As a preamble to his pronouncement on this" subject the president declares that it is not true, i.a is often asserted, that the rich are n.inr richer and the poor poorer. After complimenting the "captains of industry" for their part in the coun advises the utmost cars in legislating concerning the en terprisea by them represented. . Thi. I a widesnread conviction.' he says, "in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare. Tnis springs rrum n spirit of envy or uncharttableness. nor lack of pride in the great industrial .nv.i.vcmnt that have placed this -mmtrv at the head of the nations struggling for commercial supremacy. t . .j met nTtnn a lack ot intel ligent appreciation of the necessity of matins? chancing and changed condl- with new methods, nor upon ignorance of the fact that com-v,;.n.-,r, r.f canital In the effort to ac- mmnifeh e-reat things is necessary when the world's progress demands that great things be done. It is based upon sincere conviction that combination and concentration should be, hot pro. Jiihlted. but supervised and within rea sonable limits controlled; and in my ludement this conviction is right. The remedies nroposed for the trust evils are "regulation" and publicity. Among the recommendations strong ly urged by the president are the estab lishment of a new cabinet office to be known as the department of commerce and Industry; the re-enactment of the Chinese exclusion law; better means for enforcing the interstate commerce law. the granting of government aid to American shipping and a national irrigation systera. Those who expected a strong pro nouncement on the subject of reciproci ty will be disappointed. Reciprocal trade relations are recognised as a good thing only in those cases where they do not interfere with the protec tive principle of our tariff laws. An exception is made in the case of Cuba, which island the president declares will be self-governing before congress ad journs. In the matter of the civil service the message indicates that the president stands where he has always stood, among its warmest friends and advo cates. On the whole there is left little room for misunderstanding of the president's position on any matter which he has touched in this the first inn portant doc ument of his administration. It is a compliment to the man more than to his office that congress is re ported actually to have listened to the reading, although it occupied over two hours in the deliverance. It i worthy the perusal of every citizen in the land. t)r. H. B. Hogeboom, the coroner, was tailed as the second witness in the Hail case. "In examining Head's condition a.t the police station I found a lacerated wound three-quarters of an inch long over the left eye. He was bleeding profusely. I probed to see if there was a fracture. He flinched when I inserted the probe. At his home h walked into the house. He did not want to lie down 6n the bed for fear Ot soiling the bed clothing we ttnaliy induced him to lie down, i staid about half an hour and left. I removed the outer dressing and found that the wound had oozed considera bly." "Did he speak t tout" "No.". "Did he seem to know What you were doing?" "1 think he did." j'Did you examine his heart action?" 'His pulse was feeble." - "How long did you stay? "I got home about one o'clock." "You caused an autopsy to be held?" les." "What did you do as to investigating the condition of his skull?" "We laid back the scalp and found a red line on the skull indicating a frac ture which we found to exist. Assistant Attorney Hungate produced a skull u;n which had been tMued in blue pencil the course of the fracture on Head s skull. Attorney Ensminger objected to the use of the skull by Dr. Hogeboom -in explaining the fracture. Judge Hazen overruled the objection and allowed the skull to be used. Dr. Hogeboom described the fracture to the jury, using the skull to explain the fracture, showing it to be on the forehead. "How long was the fracture? ' asked Attorney Hungate. "From two to three inches, repuea Dr. Hogeboom. "What did you find in the skull?" "Blood and cerum." "From the examination what 1 your opinion was the cause of his death? "Fracture of the skull. On cross-examination Attorney Ens minger said: "How did you find the liver?" "The liver was enlarged." "Was it affected by alcohol?" "Yes." "How was the brain?" "It was an alcoholic brain." 

TIRED OF DELAY. Mr. Rodger s this morning Secured a price of $10,500 for the lots from the agent, Frank Brown, and the board m ay arrange to hold an Option on the property. i In speaking of the proposed new' ; high school Mr. Rodgers said this morning: , "I am heartily In favor of a manual training school, it is with difficulty j that the large classes can be handled ; in our present quarters and in conse- I quence the scholars cannot get the in ! dividual attention they need. Our pres- ent building Is inadequate and the I number of teachers insufficient and in a very short time we will be compelled to enlarge the high school facilities. I It seems to me that this can best be done by establishing a manuai training scnool which will certainly more fully meet the requirements of a large class of pupils, than by attempting to patch up an addition to our present building. The latter course will leave us in a cramped condition in many respects and spoil the architectural effect of the structure. Moreover, manual training has been adopted in most progressive towns the size of ours with satisfac- tnrv renlta a nrl v.' ehnulrl oon fit-As f Of the times. I think if we had a man ual training high school it would be most beneficial to the pupils who must leave the public school for the trades ana meciianlcal pursuits, who must de pend upon the labor of their hands for livelihood; and with no means for spe cial preparation, unless it be given them in each a school. I favor locating the school at Eighth and Harrison streets opposite the present high school building." 

SALT AND LEAD. They Will Be Exhibited With Other Kansas Minerals. FOUND HER GUILTY. Verdict of JHanslaaghter Against Mrs. Jlotcnkiss. Kansas City, Dec. 4. A Star1 special from Great Bend, Kas says: The Jury in the case of Mrs. Belle Hotchkiss, charged with the murder of James Duffey, her brother-in-law, today re turned a verdict of manslaughter in the third degree.

Says He and Clyde Moore Killed Farmer Wiltberger. Wichita, Dec. 4. A prisoner in the Sedgwick county jail at Wichita known by the name f "Shin" only, has con fessed that toe in Company with Clyde Moore and Shorty McFSarlahd, killed C.

The desiccating works are practically shut down, and nothing, but emergency business is being attended to. Frank Zingheim, the president of the desiccat ing company, says that it will be ready to open up for business in about three days, after It finishes installing its ma chinery. At the meeting of the board of health last night notice was served to Mr. Zinerheim that the board of health is getting tired of further delay, and will insist udoii the strict fulfillment of the contract which Mr. Zingheim has witn the city. The city will continue to send dead animals and garbage to the plant, and unless it is promptly disposed of will take some steps to secure the en forcement of the contract. Considerable time was spent last night in a discussion of the contagious disease situation. There are now a number or scarlet fever and diphtheria cases in town, but only one or two cases of smallpox. The question of how long a quarantine should continue was argued at length, but no changes have been made in the present rules. Questions for the milk inspector to present to dairymen in securing sani tary statistics are being prepared by the board, and last night the list was com pleted and is to be printed at once. The Questions are practically the same as the list printed in the State Journal some time ago. They are adapted from the forms used by the New Jersey board of health. 

AFTER MARTIN PLACE. Prof. Grimsley Returns From Tonr For Midwinter Fair. Prof. 3. P. Grimsley, at the head of the mineralogical department of Wash burn college, mineralogist of the state board of agriculture and cohlihissioner of the department of minerals and min eral products of the Kansas Midwinter exposition, has returned to Topeka after making a trip to all the principal cities of the state and localities that are prominent on account of mineral fea tures. Prof. Grimsley reports that he has made great progress towards working up an admirable display of minerals at tne exposition. It is true that in one or two Instances I met With a little dis couragement, but on the whole every thing is booming." he said. we will have some great exhibits or salt, lead and iron and coal. The fact that Kansas is a mineral state will be impressed upon the visitor to the expo sition as It has never been before. It is really wonderful. We are planning to maKe the display as comprehensive ana extensive as Is possible. To this end I have made arrangements for assistance by men interested in such lines in va rious parts of the state." While Prof. Grimsley makes such a flattering report," said Manager Ralph Brigham, "it gives me great pleasure to say that things are booming all along the line. The exposition is to be a great opportunity for Kansas manufacturers to display their wares to the whole of Kansas, so to speak, for with the lib eral rates offered by the railroads, one rare for the round trip, it is more than likely that thousands of people from over the state will take advantage of the rates and eome to see the exposi tion. The show Is to be well worth com ing a hundred miles to see. It will un doubtedly be the best of Its kind ever given here, and if the venture this year proves successful, and we have every reason to believe it will, the exposition will become an annual affair." Henry Auge, a Santa Fe blacksmith. cut his leg badly on a sheet of steel Tuesday afternoon. He was obliged to go to the hospital to get the wound sewed up. Gus Johnson, a blacksmith's helper, was also badly hurt Tuesday by being struck on the leg by a bar of steel which flew from under a hammer. WHAT GOES UP U. S. Troops of the Isthmus Have Gone Aboard Ship. Washington, Dec. 4. The navy de partment today received the following cablegram from Capt. Berry, command ing the battleship Iowa, dated Panama, December 4: 'I have reembarked all of our force from the isthmus, perfect security of transit being effectually restored. PRESIDENTS MEET. Railroad Officials Talk Rate (Situation. Oyer New York, Dec 4.--An important meeting of railroad officials, chiefly presidents of roads west of Chicago, was begun here today. The meeting was held in executive Session and th only information given out was that the rate situation would be discussed. Jos. Ramsey, Jr., president of the Wabash presided. Others present were: President Burt, Vice President Cornish and Winslow S. Pieree, of the Union Pacific; Edwin Hawley of the Southern Pacific: E. P. Ripley of the Atchison; Stuyvesant Fish of the Illinois Central; S. M. Felton of the Chicago & Alton and Frank Trum bull of the Colorado & Southern. 

DIES IN DENVER. Wilson Shokley, of Toceka, Meets Sudden End. Wilson Shokley, a former resident of Topeka and employe at Kuehne's Vine gar works, died very suddenly at Den ver this morning. The father and mother of the dead man, who live on East. Fairchlld street in North Topeka, left for Denver this morning. Mr. Shokley was engaged in business at Denver which required the manipu lation of large quantities of chemicals, and it is supposed that his sudden death was due to the effect of the fumes of chemicals which he inhaled. 

SANTA FE OIL CARS. Board of Education Wants It For Training School. The returns from the deer hunting country is slightly in the lead of the football field in the matter of casual ties, so far this season. Maine alone reports 12 shot, five of Whom died of their wounds. After a long period spent In delibera tion the United States supreme court has decided five to four that a country which is not foreign territory is domes tic territory. The conclusion is made to apply to the Philippines in the dia mond ring case. The danger of traversing the Chicago prairies alone has again been called to notice by the experience which a doctor carrying J9.000 in his pocket had with a highwayman. When it isn't banditti it is wolves. Contrary to the usual custom in the preparation of state papers President Roosevelt seems to have utilized his message as a medium for communicat ing his thoughts rather than for con cealing them The 3,600 bills or thereabouts, already introduced in the national house afford no guarantee that this is to be a busi ness session. The president's message scarcely cre ated a ripple on the surface of the fin ancial sea. The members of the board of educa tion favor the building of a manual training high school at the corner of Eighth and Harrison streets opposite the present high scnool building. The hlgn school is crowded, the at tendance at the school increases every vear and bv next term the board will have to take steps toward the relief- of the crowded condition. At the last meeting of the board Edward Wilder called attention to the fact that the present high school will soon be too small to accommodate the scholars de sirous of taking the higher branches and that the board would soon have to provide for another building. He called attention to the fact that the John Martin property of nine lots opposite the high school Is for sale. A. A. Rod gers was instructed to see if the board could obtain an option on the property pending the steps necessary to be taken for the building of another high school. That Is where soma people feel weak all the time. They are likely to be despondent and it is not unusual to find them borrowing trouble as if they hadn't enough already. The fact is their kidneys are weak, either naturally or because of sickness, exposure, worry or other influences. , "I am thankful to say." write. J. I. Camp bell, of Sycamore. III., " that Hood'. Sws.pe rilla has eared me. For many years I we. troubled with backache. At time. I was so bad I had to be helped from the bed or chair. I am now well and strong and free from pain." What this rreat aaedlcuae did for him it has done for others. Hood's Sarsspssrilla Promises to cure and keeps the promise. Begin treatment with Hood's today. Must Coma Down. Nothing is more certain than that the use of so-called tonics, stimulants and medicines, which depend upon alcohol for their effect, is injurious to health in the long run. What goes up must come down and the elevation of spirits, the temporary exhilaration resulting from' a dose of medicine containing alcohol, will cer tainly be followed in a few hours by a. corresponding depression to relieve which another dose must be taken. In other words, many liquid patent medicines derive their effect entirely from the alcohol they contain. Alcohol, and medicines containing it. are temporary stimulants and not in any sense a true tonic. In fact is is doubtful if any medicine or drug is a real tonio. A true tonic is something which will renew, replenish, build up the exhaust ed nervous system and wasted tissues of the body, something that will enrich the blood and endow it with the proper proportions or red ana white corpuscles, which prevent or destroy disease germs. This is what a real tonic should do. and no drug or alcoholic stimulant will do it. The only true tonic in nature is wholesome food, thoroughly digested. Every particle of nervous energy, every minute muscle, fibre and drop of blood is created daily from the food we di gest. The mere eating or rooa nas little to do with the repair of waste tissue but the perfect digestion of the food eaten has everything to ao with it. The reason so few people have perfect digestion is because from wrong habits of living the stomacn has gradually lost the power to secrete the gastric juice, peptones ana acias in sufficient quan tity. To cure Indigestion and stomach troubles It Is necessary to take after meals some harmless preparation which will supply the natural peptone and diastase which every weak stomach lacks, and probably the best prepara tion of this character is Stuart's Dys pepsia Tablets, which may be found in every drug store, and which contain In nleasant. palatable form the whole some peptoneand diastase which nature requires for prompt digestion. One or two of these excellent tablets taken after meals will prevent souring, fermentation and acidity and insure complete digestion and assimilation. Stuart s Dyspepsia xaDiets are equal ly valuable for little children as for adults, as they contain nothing harm ful or stimulating but only the natural digestives. One or Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets win digest 1,800 grains of meat, eggs or other wholesome food, and they are in every sense a genuine tonic because they- bring about in the only natural way a restorative of nerve power, a building up of lost tissue and appetite. In the only way it can be done, by the digestion and assimilation of whole some food. - - Three Hand red New Tank Cars Ordered Today. The Santa Fe today ordered 300 more oil tahk cars for use in hauling oil from Beaumont and southern Cali fornia. The trucks of these cars will be built by the American car foundry at Chicago, and the tanks by the Ham- bler-Tobin Boiler works, of Chicago. The tanks will be of 9,500 gallons ca pacity, and will all be equipped with steam heating pipes, supplied from the engine, so that oil can be handled dur ing cold weather. The cars will be ready for delivery in the spring. This order for sou tank cars is in addition to the 450 tank cars ordered some time ago. It has been decided that all of the 450 cars In the first order will be made for oil. It was originally intended to use 100 of these cars for watat Medical Board in Session. The state board of medical registra tion and examination is in session to day, and is passing upon the applica tions of physicians to practice in Kan sas. It was expected that a number of osteopaths would apply for examina tion by the board at this session, as At torney General Godard has held that the board has the authority to examine those who do not hold diplomas from accredited schools of osteopathy. The board prepared for the examination, but no osteopaths applied for examina tion this morning. IN

Cnfcago, Dec 4 Agricultural colleges were largely in evidence at the live stock exposition today, Wisconsin had a delegation of 100 from Madison, Illi nois was represented by feig' crowd of rooters from the state school at Ur bana; Michigan's yellow and blue was flaunted in the faces of rival institu tions, from several scores of manly breasts; Purdue and Minnesota turned out about fifty men and made things lively about the exhibits of their re spective eolleges. Judges in the several departments began their labors before the regular hours today because of the unusually large number of entries in all classes. In the horse department the Clydes dales were still in the ring, because the judges were unable to complete their work yesterday. In class 11, four ani mals of any age, the get of any sire, Robert Holloway of Alexis, 111., was awarded first prizes The same also cap tured the prize in class 3, for any two animals from the same dam. In the convention Prof. Eugene Davenport of the Illinois experiment station, declared that stock was judged from too many view points. "Stock is judged," said he, "from the standpoint of the butcher, the feeder, the breeder and the fancier. A more general sys tem of judging should be used." "What the livestock interests of the United States can reasonably expect of congress," was the subject of an ad dress of Hon. Wm. M. Springer of Washington D. C. He told of the trou bles of the congressman. "Congress is a very busy place," said the speaker. "To get a bill through It must be a good bill: you must be uni ted behind it and you must come to Washington and work for It. I have known bills to rest in congress for years, when nobody was opposed to them. Washington is full of pigeon holes, and the pigeon holes are full tun of bills which are sleeping the sleep which knows no awakening. If you Stockmen want to work measures through, get to work, get a stenogra pher, a typewriter and a press bureau ana eena your best men there. sou have been neglected bv consrresn. hut if you get busy, matters will improve. Jjast session there were 22,128 bills in troduced in congress, so you see that if you want your particular bill consider ed you must get behind it and push hard." Prof. H. T. Salmon, chief of the bu reau of the animal industry, spoke of "U'ederal inspection for interstate ship' ments of livestock." C. Ai Prouty. a member of the inter state commerce commission was ap plauded when his name was announced. His subject was, "Needed changes In the interstate commerce laws." He said the commission had been referred to as the judicial "it." The present law which the commission was founded and by which its acts should be wiped off the slate and new ones enacted. "The. time is fast coming." the sneaker de clared impressively, "when there will be no competition between railroads. The cost of bringing a steak from Texas to Vermont Is now only about a cent pound. This Is due to competition among the railroads. This competition you cattlemen should try to promote. What is the purpose of these railroad commissions? To make money. It is not reduction In operating expenses whereby the roads expect to increase their dividends, it is by forcing more freight money from the public." The convention adopted resolutions voicing their satisfaction in the fact that a man who understands the cattle Interests sits in the president's chair at Washington. After lamenting the death of President McKinley the resolutions read: "Resolved. That we send srfeetihe-B to President Roosevelt, assuring him of the loyalty and support of the stockmen of the country in all his undertakings for the good of the people. We recognize in our new chief executive one who is familiar with the industry we represent. who has Wielded a lariat and branding Iron, and knows personally of the joys, the hardships and the fatigues of life on tne rancn and range. The cowboy on tne range ana the stockman on the ranch all feel that in President Roose velt the nation has a loyal, honest and fearless ruler, and the live stock Indus try has a friend at Court in the person or one wno Knows tne needs ana neces sities of that industry."
