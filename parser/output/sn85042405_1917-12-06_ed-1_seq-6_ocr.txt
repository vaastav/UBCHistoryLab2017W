The festive, money-scattering, pleas ure-loving city has gone dry wheth er bone dry or not, it is officially dry. In the senate and house cafes the whiskey cocktail and the "bubble water'" can no longer be served to create an artificial appetite for ter rapin, lobster, canvasback duck, and other expensive dishes. When Mr. Wilson signed the bill it was the first time a president ever attached his signature to a prohibition law in this country. Bryan and other temperance work ers celebrated the passage of the new law making the District of Columbia dry. The law also operates outside of the district, in that it is made a crime for anyone to sell liquor to a soldier or sailor of the United States, and for any house of "gilt frame" to be near a soldier's cantonment. Bry an told, a new illustrative story at the jubilation and predicted that vOhio and other states with large wet cities would soon become dry. He said: "I .have just come from Arizona. While out there I saw the peculiar bird called a Road-runner and I 'learned that when he meets a rattle snake, instead of having a bloody en counter with him, he' begins to pick off the eactus and surrounds the snake with a circle of cactus pieces, then he picks them up piece by piece and puts them closer to the snake until the poisonous reptile is shut in a close place and, unable to cross the cactus hedge, he stings himself to death. That is what we are doing with the traffic that biteth like a ser pent and stingeth like an adder. We are shutting him up in close quar ters in a few wet cities and a few backward states and in this close confinement we are going to let him sting himself to death." The credit for this great change in sentiment in congress, as reflected in Washington'aridity,/'was given not to the individual efforts of congress men themselves (for many personal ly opposed the bill altho voting for it) but to the pressure from the out side—to the active work of men and women of Kansas, North Dako ta, Oregon, and other states, mostly from the west. Pressure of this moral kind has always had a great effect on any legislative body, and again shows what could be accomplished for the further benefit of the whole country in other material ways, if the out side provinces of the United States would act together as determinedly as they have in the matter of secur ing the prohibition of the sale of al coholic drink. The election of mem bers of any legislature or congress to carry out any specific purpose wanted by the voters can easily be had if the voters act together. AN 

AMERICAN BIBLE SOCIETY CAMPAIGN. The American Bible Society, of New York City has undertaken to supply soldiers in the U. S. army with a copy of the Bible. It is pro posed to equip every soldier and sailor in Uncle Sam's fighting forces with a new testament, khaki clad in binding. The church in this cam paign is reflecting the spirit of mili tant energy, and the Bible Society is undertaking to raise a fund of $400, 000. Officers in command of the armies naturally approve of this proposition, as men facing danger, in many cases are sustained and cheered by an understanding of promises held out by the Christian Bible This idea has been expressed by the Bible Society as follows: "Men today are facing a spiritual crisis^ They are looking for an exr planation of the wrongs in the pres* ent world and for a religion upon -which to reconstruct a new one, when this war is over. Certainly the New Testament teachings of a kingdom founded upon justice, pur ity and democracy, with God as King, are impossible of realization with the Prussian spirit abroad in the world. And certainly these are the ideals toward which the whole world yearns. The American Bible Society would send these ideals into the trenches with the American Ar- .Contributions for this purpose uld be sent to The American Bi l)'o Society, Astor Place, New York' City fMtHu -'V Sj.it RAILROADS' WAR SERVICE fTfce Railroad War Board depart ©f information furnishes from to time to the press ojt the country, facts regarding the move- of reighT%nd other -matter* •*ujl JJlli 'i 'a- connected with the var service .by the railroads.

Fur thermore, our government at this time has plenty of vast problems to solve without adding the transporta tion system to its burden." THANKSGIVING IN 1917. Many of the usual felicitations which are wont to be expressed in the press, pulpit and in public places on the occasion of the annual Turkey festival, were omitted this year. However North Dakotans still "have much to be thankful for." They have had a month of fine fall weath er, and nature is showing herself more considerate as the year draws to a close than she was during the growing season. Perhaps the lessons taught by the exigencies of the crop year, and by the great war, will prove of value in the future. The North Dakota farm ers generally did as they were urged to do la.st spring, sacrifice nearly all their farm efforts in the attempt to raise a big crop of grain, to help our allie?vin the war. The result provc4^^lpoiniing, but the farm er is not to blame for that, neither for the shortage of pastures, and the lack of -SSfed jffrom which cause many of^he unfinished meat animals of ti|e wateinav^ been forced to sale at ah inopportune time.

MESSAGE. President Wilson's message to the country' and the world yesterday was a far reaching and important statement, outlining again the gen eral purposes of the war with Ger many, and recommending that the United States declare war on Austria Hungary, which will no doubt be done without delay. The message has great significance from the fact that both houses of congress have a majority which 1b no doubt in favor of Wery recommendation made by the president, who states the only purpose of this nation's part in the war is to secure the downfall of German military autocracy, to secure future peace for all nations. This shall be itione,.: says the president who declares '-our present and im mediate task is to win the war and nothing shall turn UB aside from it until it is accomplished. Every pow er and resource we possess, whether of men, or of money, or of mater ials, 1b being devoted and will con tinue to be devoted to that purpose until ,it is achieved." in his message at another point he refers to the settlement, after the war is over and when the terms/.of peace are considered. He declares that the United States will not con sent to any agreement wherein na tional selfishness and compromises were entered into as at the Congress at Vienna. The Congress of Vienna waiKheld in 1815 and was a settlement by the were fighting Napoi^C^ttti Htm i fin ally secured his downfall.''' In this (settlement AustrU. England, Prus­ sia and Russia, acted together/ and in secret treaties parcelled? out amongst themselves the SifiaUer countries of central Europe, in a manner which showed that territor-, lal aggrandizement was one of the main objects of the peace confer ence. Such purpose, says President Wilson, the United States, as a mem ber of the future peace tribunal, will not consent to, as we are fighting for the liberties and freedom, of man knid, and for the protection of the pinall nations of the world against the more powerful ones.t' i It is interesting to- note,-in con nection with the Congress at Vienna that the United States was theji at. war with England which had invade ed our shores and burned the public buildings at Washington, the national capital. Napoleon was keeping Eng land busy on the continent of Eu rope, otherwise the outcome of the war with the United States might have been vastly different. As showing the changes that have occurred since that time, Gen. Jack son defeated the British in a bloody attack at New Orleans, and the bat tle occurred a month after peace had been declared, between England and the United States but neither of the armies opposing each other knew of it. There was no wireless in those days. 

HENS WILL HELP WINTHEWAR Back-yard Poultry Pens Are Asked For. Last spring the Federal govern ment started a campaign of vege table gardening in the back-yards and vacant lots. All over the United States people responded cheerfully to these suggestions and the conse quence has been that an immense supply of food has been raised on ground where it was never produced before. The war garden will be con tinued, and in many cases will re main as a permanent adjunct to many households after the war. The value of vegetables as food, the ease with which they can be raised, and the saving they make in thfe family expense bill for the table, are now recognized by thousands who never even considered the sub ject before. Hens and Eggs iNow. The government has ^noW under taken another campaign of an even greater value for thousands of peo ple. This is for the raising of poul try for the production of meat and eggs. Townspeople and residents in the suburbs of cities, are urged to procure enough hens to supply the family with eggs.. That means about two hens for each member of the family ten hens should be sufficient for a family of five. Poultry is a luxury in many cities as vwell as in the country. In the back yard poultry pens can materially reduce the cost of living. Farmers are ask ed, also, to double their poultry pro duction next year, and every farm should have an average of one hun dred instead of forty hens. The town dwellera should get at least enough eggs from their poultry for their own use. A suitable outhouse, some wire fencing, and a few hens will do the business. Information oi detailed advice, if needed, can be had by writing to the state Agri cultural College or consulting the county agent.

The Alert is hi receipt of the fol lowing note froth a lady reader of Jamestown enclosing the article printed below: "This article was written by an Iowa woman and published in an Iowa newspaper and as I am the mother of a family of boys, which I am trying to raise clean and pure, do not thin|c it is one bit too bad ifpr. the men Jolf North Dakota and 'Jamestown to readf. Saiv6 on Tobacco. "I see the newspapers and maga zines full of suggestions where and how women may save for the war and I see that-most «it my friends have signed the conservation pledge. Also I take note that the average woman is figuring ways and means of saving. But I haven't- seen a pledge paper circulated or signed where men have agreed to abandon tobacco in order to save for the war. I have' seen appeals to men who use tobacco to double their ex penditures and when buying for themselves to buy the same quan tity for the soldiers. And it appears that they do it, by the newspaper reports of barrels "filled by those pur chases. "I haven't been in any town of any size for years that hasn't had a half dozen or more cigar and to bacco stores. The druggists all sell, cigars. Some of the barber shops sell them, I am informed. All the restaurants and hotels sell them. I heard a man the other day complain ing that the ..price of cigars had gone up but 11didn't bear him say anything about" cutting down his daily allotment. "Suppose that 15,000,000 men smoke, half a ^dollar's worth of .cig ars and tobacco a day. It would take about four days' abstinence to raise that $35,000,000 for the Y. M. C. A., wouldn't it? A year's expen diture would mighty near pay off the first Liberty- Loan, wouldn't it?

RICENEGLECTED. In many ways rice is a most whplesome and nutritious article of food and comparatively cheap. But a local grocer states that notwith standing the food campaign to se cure use of substitutes for wheat flour, rice is generally neglected. One reason may be a lack of knowl edge to properly cook rice and' make it into appetizing dishes. There are plenty of recipes for this and with a little care the cereal can be thoroly cooked and served in num erous ways. More persons find a steady nour ishment in rice, thruout. the world, counting the Oriental nations, than any other article of food. A Chinese or Japanese laboring man will do a hard day's work on a bowl or two of rice with a little raw fish mixed in. PRESIDENT'S ME^SAGK BY WIRE.
