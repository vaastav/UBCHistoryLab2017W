WASSISOTOM, Dec. 10.—Wesley Green, who forwarded to the Obioego Time* some reported peace propositions from Jeff. Davis to President Lincoln, is an impostor. He came to Washing ton to see President Lincoln, who ascertained that there was DO grounds for his nonsensical statements. WABHMOTOR, Dec. 10*—'The Navy Depart ment haa information that tbe United Statee steamer Montgomery, on the Sdth ilt, captured the rebel steam aloopWinchesterwith a cargo of cotton, while attempting to run the blookado at Mobile.

Wesley Green, and professing to reside at Pittsburgh, Pa., came to tbe President some, time in November, and stated to him that be had had two interviews with Jeff. Davis in Richmoud, tbe last of October. Also, certain statements which be said Davis had made to him on those occasions. Tbe President, however, became satisfied that Green had not seen Davis at all, and that the entire story was a very shal low attempt at deception. Jeff Davis can re deem Green's character, if he will, by rerifiying his statement. Tbe President, on Monday sent a messsge to Gen. Sibley, ordering the execution of 89 of the Minnesota Indians on the 19tb inst. These form the only class of the criminals and include tbe Indians concerned in tbe massacre of families or in other brutal outrages.

Tee Mexicans were actualy fortifying Puebla and tbe City of Mexico, and the road between them, and announoo their determination to flood tbe valley by opening tbe sluioea and taking down the walls of tbe lakes, making the City of Mexico impoesiibe to be reaohed except by the turnpike, which will be defended.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11.—HOUSE.—Tbe bill passed to adjust appropriations heretofore n.ade for the civil service of the Navy Department to correspond with the requisitions of the departs ment. ROSCOE CONKLIN asked leave to report bill to establish a uniform system of bankrupt cy, and desired that a day should be assigned for its consideration. The Spesker reminded the gentleman that the Select Committee on that subject, bad expired with the former session of Congress, and would have to be revised. Mr. YEATMAN offered the following, to lie over for further consideration: Resolved by tbe House of Representatives, the Senate con curring, that the Proclamation of tbe President of tbe 22nd of November 1862, Is not warranted by the constitution, that the notice of emanci patlon aa indicated in the Proclamation is not calculatcd to hasten the restoration of Peace, is not well chosen as a war measure, and is an as sumption of power dangerous to the rights of citizens and to the perpetuity of free Govern ment. Mr. 

LOVEJOY moved to lay the resolution on the table. Carried by 94 to 45. Tbe House then went into Committee on tbe Whole on the President's Message. Mr HUTOHINS spoke at length, taking for a text, that freedom and slavery were incompat ible and beyond hope of reconciliation and com promise. Mr. 

MKNZIES, replying, said he was in tbe habit of regarding tbe enemies of the proclama tion as tbe friends of the Constitution. He understood the gentleman from Ohio, Mr, Hut chins, to be opposed to tbe Union as it was. No doubt tbese reasons asaigoed by bim for the de. feat of the Republicans were satisfactory to tbe gentleman himself. But he, Meozies, would tell bim that tbeee disasters to that party were attri butable to the Abolition programme of the President and his party. Mr. Meozies recapitu lated the measures adopted by the Republicans, Including the abolition of slavejry and tbe con fiscation act?, which, he said, were shocking to tbe civilization of tbe age. The recent elections, however, were more appalling to the rebels than any thing that could happen, because a free peo pie who will not submit to the tyranny at Wash ington will not submit to the overthrow of the Constitution. Tbe committee arose, and the House ad ourned. SENATE.—Messrs.

Ordered to be printed. Tbe resolution relative to the arbitrary arrest of certain citizens of Delaware, was taken up. Mr. 

MORRILL oontended that the resolution, as it stood, ,was not a mere resolution of inquiry, but a charge against the Government, and an indictment against President Lincoln, and that he (Morrill,) should vote for no suoh resolution He claimed that in this state of war and rebel lion, with the land fall of traitors aud spies, the Commander-in-Chief baa a riggt to arrest such men. No one, not even the Sdhator from Delaware, Sau'.sbury, haa claimed that these men were loyal. There had been many arrests made and the presumption is that the President has been arresting guilty men ud simply doing his1 force.

It is known that tbe BtSte of tucky has been but a nest of traitor* Three out every four able bodied mea of Ken tutcky have gone to rebeldooL aad nobody to Tntttbei* but old women, yet toe Senator from KjSOtucky, Powell, asks for comtsisseratton for these men, that Senator Powell had denounced tM Government from the beginning the same a#M9 colleague who followed the logical result of his reasoning and had gone into the rebel army hut not a single word has that Senator, Powell, offered against the rebeis, and rejoices over the recent elections and says the lion-heart ed democracy are rebuking this AdmlsiatratiOn. Will not every rebel throughout rebeldom re joice in the same way? It ia supposed there will be a peace party in the North that will force this Government^ into an inglorious peace, encouraged- by Jeff Da*is. and foreign countries in their sjbemes of inter vention to be the same view throughout that these men were loyal. Mr. Morrill contended that there was no grounds for complaint—that men were arrested on suspicion Men were always arrested on suspicion of crime. Mr. WRIGHT moved to amend the resolution so as to make the call upon the President instead of upon tbe Secretary of War. Ms. Wright said be knew, no man was permitted to live in South who had any sympathy with the North. He said he would like to see some of the spirit that was ahown by 8tonewali Jackson wten be found forty seven of his men "skedaddling from them. He marched them jo front of the regi ment and bad every qpe of them shot. Instead of this we had propositions for conventions, Ac.

Mr. BAYAjRD argued at some length to show that the affairs of tbe State of Kentucky had nothing whatever to do with tbe State of Dela« were, and that true loyalty to the country did not Imply loyalty to any single individual. If this is a free country, the people in It have a right to enquire into the acts of the President 'Mr. 

POWELL said he had said ..the President had violated the Constitution, and he was ready to prove it He defied the Senator from Maine or any other Senator on this floor, to the test on this question. He denied that three out-of four of the people of the State of Kentucky trere in the rebel army. Three-fourths of tbe people of that State are not in arms at all. He believed that there, were more men lb the Union than in the rebel Srmy. He (Powell) wanted to indulge in no personalities with any Senator, as there was a way to settle personal matters elsewhere. He wanted Senators to meet his arguments fair. He did not beliete this Union could ev£r be re stored by force of arms, therefore he had op- red the war, and should continue to oppose He ws8 in favor of the conventfbn proposed by his colleague, Davis. He Bbould also vote for an armistice while that Convention should continue to be in session. He contended that President Lincoln violated the Constitution in enlarging the regular army, in suspending the writ of habeas corpus, in arresting citizens, in interfering with the freedom of the preBS, and in bis recent proclamation. Mr. 

FESSENDEN was willing to admit that some things bad been done apparently without law. The cry that tbe country was in danger came always from papers sympathizing with tbe rebellion. Many things may be and mast be done in times like these which ordinarily would not be allowed. Does anybody doubt the patri otism of the President of the United States?— Does anyone pretend that he has not done what he thought best to suppress the rebellion and preserve the country, or that he haB wilfully vio lated the rights of any citizens? tfpeclala to New York Papers.

During the might the jkn toons were conveyed to tbe river, ana'the ar­ tillery of 14« pieces placed in pdsitiofi oMosite^ the citv. •. At«" o'clock tlita morntog the rebels flreffiird signal Jpins, and durhig toe latter part of the night rockets trere frequently setfn within fhelr lines. At S o'clock the construction of -three bridges in front of the City was commenced.— When the bridges were about half completed the enemy opened a murderous fire of infantry from the houses on the river bank. Up to this time not a shot had been fired from*our side.— The engineers were driven froth the bridges, and several killed and wounded. At 6 o'clock Gen. Burnside ordered all the guns to be opened on the oity. The cannonade, #blch has continued up to the present time, is terrible. The city Is on fire,.and its destruction is certain. The enemy, about 7 O'clock this morning, opened with their heavy guns from their works, but so far, have done no serious injury. Gen. Franklin constructed his bridjps about three Utiles below the city, meeting with but slight opposition. His troops are sow crossing and the gunboats ere shelling tbe enemy, about 15 miles down the river, where they have been concentrating their forces for the past few days. Tbe concentrated fire of our batteries upon the city, has had tbe effect of driving back the enemy's infantry, and the work on the bridges has bgain been resumed. The troops are all under arms near the river, prepared to rush across as soon as the bridges are completed. 

HXAOQUAXTKSS, Thursday Noon.—On the at tempt being made to finish the bridges in front of tbe city the rebel infantry again opened their 'fire, when our artillery in position again opened on the city. The result being that the city was fired In several places. Tbe enemy has used very little artillery up to this time, as it would endanger their own men who are holding the river front. Buruside has just issued an order to concen trate every available gun on tbe city under the covar of the fire of whteh it is believed the bridges can be finished. Tbe killed and wounded do not amount to mare than fifty men. HEADQUARTERS A RUT or POTOMAC, Dec. 11, Evening.—But little firing took place between I and 3, during which time ail the available batteries were placed in position. They number ed 176 guns. At a signal all opened on tbe city. The fire was terrible, but the rebel sharp shooters could not be driven from their hiding places. The shot and shell went through the houses, In many cases setting them on fire and causing a dense smoke, which, together with the explosion of so large a quantity of powder, al most hid the city from view. It soon became evident that the bridges could not be built without a bold dash. Volunteers were called for to cross in small boats. The or der was no sooner given than hundreds stepped forward, but ail could not go. About 100 were selected. They were soon on their way, while tbe artillery threw a perfect storm of iron hail on the opposite bank. They reached the oppo site shore, but not without loss. With fixed bayonets they rushed upon the enemy, killing several and taking 101 prisoners, who were safe ly landed on this ride. At half past 4 two bridges were finished op posite tbe city, when ti\e troops immediately began to cross over. Tbe enemy were soon driven from tbe city back to their line of field works. The two bridges in front of Franklin's corps were successfully laid early tn the day, but his troops did not cross until the upper ones were ready. A sufficieat force is now on the opposite side of the river to resist an attack that is likely to be made. The rebels fired but few guns in the morning and none in the afternoon, although their works were in easy range. During the forenoon the rebels burned the railroad bridge outside the city. Between 30 and 40 houses were burned, mostly in the busi ness part of the city. During the day between 8,000 and 9,000 rounds of ammunition were fired into the city by our artillery. Everything is quiet to night. The indications are that a battle will be fought to-morrow. JHore About the Alabama. NEW YORK, Dec. 11.—The Alabama,* until close upon the captured vessels, carried tbe American flag. The crews of the two vessels, except Capt Sinclair, of tbe T. B. Wales, were kept In Irons till they reached Martinique. Capt Simmes said she was the 23d vessel he had burned. Tbe 2d mate and 8 of her crew joined the Alabama's crew, which now numbers 150. Upon the arrival of the San Jacinto at Mar tinique, she furnished the brig Hammond, in port* with rockets to be sent up when the Ala bama was leaving port. The San Jaoioto also kept two armed boats playing about the harbor at night, but they did not observe her exit. The Alabama was furnished with a pilot by the French authorities, and was, it is sup posed, piloted out by a chancel unknot n to the San Jacinto. The Hammond was immediately seized by the French authorities and was still in custody when the schooner Alice left. The San Jacinto was three mites at sea, and only knew of the Alabama's escape when the Alice came out. The cargo of tbe T. B. Wales was valued at (200,000. Tbe Alabama went to Martinique to receive coal from the English brig. The latter also brought her two Armstrong 100 pounders. The brig went off with the Alabama. It was reported at St. Thomas that the Ala bama had been piloted in the harbor of St. Johns, a few milea above, and was then taking in coal and guns. The intelligence was sent to the San Jacinto.

The 51st Ohio and 35th Indiana were taken back by Matthews at double-quick and in thirty minutes repulsed enemy. The wagons were retired rapidly to camp, escorted by the 51st Ohio and 8 th Kentucky, forming the rear .guard. Half an hour later the enemy ettacked us again in our rear, and after sharp fighting were repulsed. Tbe Brigade returned to camp without losing a wagon. Lieut. Col. Balfe, of tbe 35th Ohio, bad the bond of his left arm badly shattered.* Adjutant B. R. Muler, of the same regiment, was killed. Lieut Jesse McDaniel, of the 8th Kentucky, is supposed to have been killed—two privates besides.

Moffitt The steamer probably tbe Oveito, although we have no intel ligence of her escape from Mobile. BURNSIDK'S EKR&QV.—The difference in the personal characteristics of our present chief and the decapitated McClellan is quickly noted by tbe troops. They see in Burnside the most energetic personal efforts, and he is already noted for performing more hard work than any officer beneath him. He gives the most assiduous personal attention to the detail* of his arniy Wcrk, and knows everything that is going on. I have seen him every day this week, sometimes alone and again attended by only a single orderly, making his tour of busi ness through the camps to the landings, off on the steamer, traveling aa unceremoniously as any other passenger, and taking his meals when he can catoh them. He has the same earneet, energetic manner that you see in every thorough business man. His personal staff a&d escort, except on very rare oocaaions do not ride at his backjhe despises ostentation. He sends his staff officers each to his appo priate work, and you will see them about the army at all times, carrying out earnestly the order of their General. Generai Buroside is one of the best of men Frank and cordial in manner, always aocessi ble, without prejudice he listens to pugges* tions from his. inferiors with as much deffer ence as he pays to his equals. His heart and soul are bound up in his preeent work, and with bis overflowing physical energies and act ive brain he will, accomplish more with this army than it has ever yet. achieved. I can speak of Burnside thus tori know him--and my impressions date from tbe time (ayearago) when he, almost alone among all otherq, was the only buoyant heart that had any hope for the success of his wrecked and stranded expe dition, but which, through his own iodomita ble energy and resolution, was saved from de structioa, and achieved for the country the first important success which opened the spring Campaign of the present year— [Falmouth Cor.

TAKING OF FBBBBBICKlBVBtt. Farther Partlcalars. [Herald's special.] HEADQUARTERS, opposite Fredericksburg, Dec 11, 3 p. m.—Between 4 and 5 o'clock this morning the pontoon train in charge of the 17th and 50th J. Y. englteers, uudlp* commaM of Gen. Wos4bury, proceeded to tbe river tyhk where wild infaatry support, tbey attCmptS to thrtnr tbtfe bridges across th£ rivor. Adull haze so obscured the movement, that for a time it was not discovered by tbe rebel pickets. The pontoonlers bad succeeded io partially con structing bridges, when tbe rebels suddenly opened a brisk and deadly £re of musketry from along tbe banks of the rivier and windows of bouses, compelling a cessation of work. Returning to the cover of tbe surrounding hills, our men al formed, and aboet 6 o'clock the attempt wafe renewed, but the rebels had now been thoroughly aroused, and with reinforce ments of sharpsliogt^rsf swarmed to the opposite banks and houses. Nothing daunted by tbe hot fire which tbey ponred4n«tths reappearance of our troops, the pontooniers went gallantly to work. Bat in vain. A storm of bullets envel oped them, and the prinks and boats were rid dled by every volley Once more they wers compelled to withdraw, and fell back to the cover 'a ridge of hills running parallel with the rirrr. was evident the rebels were determined to use the houses of tbe city tor a defense, contrary to an implied agreement in a correspondence which recently passed, by fUg gf truce. Orders were given to our artillerymen to ,open fire upon the oity. Accordingly, Edward^, Mnllefcberg's, add other batteries of 9 corps, together with batter ies of corps to the right and left Of fbe city, com menced almost simultaneously the bombardment. The fog was eo deaee that it was impossible see but a short distance beyond tbe edge of the river. Houses, however, in which the rebel sharpshooters bad eeoonoed tbemeelvee were plainly visible, and to »these the fire was pars tieularly directed the effect was their partial demolition in a short time after the first fire they became untenantable by the rebel riflemen who retreated to tbe rear of the town where they took shelter behind the as yet unharmed build ings. By 1 o'clock the hombardment became general, and from that time until 1 o'clock the roar of artillery was incessant—the batteries of the 9th raked the- streets with shell, shrapnel and grape—though tbe fog still continued to obscure in a measure the results of these dis charges tbe rebels with the greatest stubborn ness still kept within the city, and at times parties of them could be seen going from one point to another on double quick. Tbe carnage cansot but be fearful amongst them. It was somewhat singular that the rebel battery did not return tbe fire of our guns. Up to the present time they have not opened. About ten o'clock the engineers formed for a third attempt to construct bridges. After pre vious ineffectual attempts on the part of the engineers, to cross, a party of eighty of the St& Connecticut, under Capt Marsh, volunteered to assist in this bew endeavor to finish the bridges, and once more a column with this reinforcement started, under the direction of Gen. Woodbury. They seized planks and carried out some dozen to the end of the string of boats, placed a part of them, and were then compelled to retire under very galling fire from the rebel sharp shooters, who were ensconced securely in rifle pits below the range of artillery and within fifteen or twenty feet of the rivet's edge. The engineers suffered severely. The movement having been thus interrupted^ the whole party was ordered back to their orig inal position. At 11 o'clock it was discovered that one of the bouses was on fire, the flames of which commenced in a westerly part of the ci ty, soon spread, and Fredericksburg is now en veloped in fire and smoke. An enfilading Ire has been opened on the rebel rifle pits up tbe river. It has been successful so far in driving the sharpshooters from the vicinity of tbe rail road depot. Tbe engineers are now constructing a bridge across tbo river. The rebels still hold their ground opposite the upper bridge. Our oavalry are now passing Sumner's headquarters, en route to make a charge across the river at one of the fords. Aquia Creek, midnight, Dec. 11.—Intelligence from the front to-night states that our forces have crossed the river, and are now in possession of Frekericksburg. An enfilading fire from oar batteries on the right succeeded in driving the rebels from the rifle pits on the river's edge, thereby permitting an easy and rapid construc tion of pontoon bridges.
