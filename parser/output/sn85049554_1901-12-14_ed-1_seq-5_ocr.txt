'Mm Rnd FROM ALL OVER IOWA Public Opinion on Iowa Subjects cs Reflected in the Iowa Newspapers. «fc?Sa The News of Iowa From Hun dreds of Differeut Towns mm Communities' |FARM RENTER'S OUTLOOK. [Wright County Monitor.] The fact that land has increased in value makes it compulsory on the own to ask higher rent for the use of his land in order to realize the same per cent on his investment. This fact and the further fact that so many renters will pay cash rent next year will cause many renters to work for their board next summer, unless the crops are good and sell for as much as this year. The landlord is safe because the law gives him a lien on all the crop and the per sonal property of the tenant. w"--- WHERE DO THE PENNIES GO? [Waterloo Reporter.] 'Where do all the pennies and pins go""' is a still unanswered question. The Commercial National bank of this city has made a demand on the treas ury department for $200 worth of the shining new coppers. This will mean that 20,000 bran new pennies will be put into circulation in Waterloo within a very short time. The banks of the city are constantly shipping pennies this way from the treasury and it is a mys tery to them what becomes of them. There has not been a single shipment of copper colnB out of Waterloo In the memory of the bankers and yet the banks do not have a sufficient number of pennies to fill the demand. The same way with other coins. The same insti tutlon recently ordered $500 worth or 5,000 dimes from the treasury depart ment. The bulk of these coins is large. The coins are constantly disappearing from fcirculatlon and no one seems to be able to solve the drainage. IOWA NEWS ITEMS Pocahontas. The Record says there is no smallpox In Pocahontas.

But here is the oddity: Corn, o»ts, potatoes, hay, pigs, poultry and what, not are so high in price that to leave them beyond the reach of the owners' eyesight is like hanging $10 bills on the clothesline.

SUNDAY READING. All Sorts of Opinion#. MORAL TONE OF MESSAGE. The moral qualities of the president's message were discussed by Kev. David Beaton at Lincoln Park snd Congregational: portance. "The tragedy which placed President Roosevelt in the chair of state made his first message a delicate and difficult task. On the one hand in danger of overlauding his predecessor or failing to come up to the highly wrought expecta tions of a sorrowing people, and on the other of losing his o\vn individuality in the recommendation of measures of his predecessor or appearing to treat those measures with disrespect. In both these sets of dilemmas the new president has acquitted himself with delicacy and wis dom. "In the body of the message we notice first: The spirit of fair play and impar tiality in the treatment of all questions involving the rights of capital and the rights of the people, especially In the conservative, discriminating and yet fearless examination of the trusts and their influence on the government of a free people. The enemies and the friends of trusts alike must pause and recognize that they have rights that can not be in fringed without danger of commercial death and that they carry evils which threaten the very existence of a free people. "Again, the message gives evidence of a strong, intelligent sympathy with the wage-workers and laboring classes." 

"POWIE, THE COLOSSAL FRAUD." "Dowieism, the Colossal Fraud of the Century." was the theme of Rev. Henry Trving Rasmus in South Park Methodist Episcopal church. Mr. Rasmhssald: "We are to take a character from the portrait gallery of the New Testament and the first century as a fair type of a personality so prominently before the public In the opening of the twentieth century. Simon the Magus had be witched the people by his sorceries and announced himself 'as some great one.' The people said of him, 'This man Is the great power of God.' "Justin Martyr, who lived In the first century, said that he went to Rome dur ing the reign of Claudius, where he sralned such a reputation as to be wor shiped as a god. This impostor, wit nessing the marvelous power of the apostles, sought It presumably for his own selfish aggrandizement. His suc cessor of reincarnation is here in these opening days of this last century. "Every ago has had its religious Im postor. who has attempted to startle the world by bis claim of divine authority to revolutionize tho existing order of things. Of these Jesus himself spoke, saying 'many false prophets should arise,' accompanied by the warning not to follow them. "We are to consider the most notable of modern times. Let me remind you that the times are propitious for the de velopment of this admixture of many kinds of vagaries. This Is one of the transitional periods in which many peo ple are adrift in their beliefs, and any thing made characteristically plausible will have multitudinous following for a season. "Permit us to consider this subject under three items—the man, the system, the results which will inevitably follow In due time. "When nature made the founder of this somewhat new organization it made a freak. Of great determination, with a marked ability for commercial shrewd ness, he has succeeded where many a smaller man would have hopelessly failed. The reckless audacity of this self-claimed modern incarnation of a generous olden prophet is beyond paral lel. "Suppose we draw a comparison be tween these two Elijahs? Elijah the ilrst, bold, courageous, mighty reformer that he was, went forth in the deliver once of his message without escort. Eli jah the second goes forth surrounded by a four-square guard. Elijah the first was fed by the ravens, whereas Elijah the second, as a Chicago newspaper has put it, is fed by the gulls. "Elijah the first sought the widow's tld, but he paid back In a wonderful way by 'a barrel of meal that wasted rtot, and a cruse of oil that never failed.' Elijah the second seeks the widow's aid gets it, but the widow looks in vain t'or barrel or cruse. Elijah the first railed for fire out of heaven upon the heiads of the enemies of God, and it came. Elijah the second thunders away for the fire upon the heads of his ene mies, but It never comes. Elijah the first walked footsore and w6ary, Elijah the second rides In the handsomest of Car riages dravyn by the sleekest of horses. "Elijah the first ended his earthly career a poor man. Elijah the second, when he dies, will be rich as Croesus. Elijah the first went to heaven in a chariot of glory in the midst of a whirl wind. It is yet to be ascertained how and in which direction Elijah the sec ond will go. "It does seem that this reincarnation of Elijah discovered that he made a mistake in his first history, and IS now attempting to rectify, ao far as possible, the mistakes of his former record. As a commercial barterer in religious things he has no peer. He boasts that If he lives twenty-five years longer he will be the richest man in America, Has he for gotten the divine Injunction, 'A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches.' "Claiming to be a representative of the Chist, let us put them side by side— Jesus Christ, who could say 'The foxes have holes and the birds of the air have being the idea around which the most fertile remuneration In a material way will cluster. "All 'that a man hath will he give for his life' is an adage which holds good today among the multitudes who des pair in their sickness. With Its peculiar foibles this organisation can not stand the test of many years. When the pres ent presiding genius dies it will wither and perish, or at most take Its place by the side of numerous other isms that church, Chicago. He said: I have held the attention of the public for "In a democratic form of government the moral qualities belonging to the head of the nation are of supreme im- an hour anJ then have sunk into com- parative obscurity."

He should have proceded from Clen fuegos to Santiago de Cuba with all dis patch, and should have disposed his ves sels with a view of Intercepting the ene my In any attempt to pass the flying squadron. He should not have delayed the squad ron for the Eagle. He should not have made the retro grade turn westward with his squadron. He should have promptly obeyed the navy department's order of May 25. He should have endeavored to capture cr destroy the Spanish vessels at anchor near the entrance of Santiago harbor on May 29 and 30. He did not do his utmost vvith the force under his command to capture or destroy the Colon and other vessels of the enemy which he attacked on May 1. By commencing the engagement on July 3 with the port battery and turning the Brooklyn around with port helm, Commodore Schley caused her to lose distance and position with the Spanish vessels—especially with the Viscaya and Colon. The turn of the Brooklyn to starboard was made to avoid getting her into dan gerous proximity to the Spanish vessels. 'The turn was made toward the Texas and caused that vessel to stop and1 back her engines to avoid a possible collision Admiral Schley did injustice to Lieu tenant Commander A. C. Hodgson in publishing only a portion of the'corre spondence which passed between them Commodore Schley's conduct In con nection with the events of the Santiago campaign prior to June i, 1898, was characterized by vacillation, dllatorl uess and lack of enterprise. His official reportB regarding the coal supply and the coaling facilities of the flying squadron were Inaccurate and misleading. His conduct during the battle of July was self-possessed and he encouraged in his own person his subordinate offi cers and men to fight courageously.
