To the Senate and House of Repre sentatives: The people of this country continue to enjoy great prosperity. Undoubtedly there will be ebb and flow in such pros perity, and this ebb a»d flow will be felt jnore or less by all members of the com munity. A general failure of crops would hurt all of us. Again, if the folly of man roars the general well-being, then thosq who are innocent of the folly will have to pay part of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of tlu: folly. A panic brought on by the speculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the whole business community. But euch stoppage of welfare, though it might bo severe, would not be lasting. In the long run the one vital factor in the permanent prosperity of the country Is the high individual character of the averago American worker, no matter •whether his work be mental or manual, •whether he be farmer or wage-worker, business man cr professional man. In our industrial and social system the Interests of nil men are so closely inter twined that in the immense majority of cases a straight-dealing man who by his eflicienc.v, by his ingenuity nud Industry, benefits himself must also benefit others. Normally the mnn of great productive capacity who becomes rich by guiding the labor of many other men docs so by enabling them to produce more than the.v •could produce without his guidance and both he aud they share in the benefit, which comes also to the public at large. The superficial fact that the snaring may be unequal must never blind us to the •underlying fact that there is this shar ing, and that the benefit comes in some degree to each man concerned. Nor mally the wage-worker, the man of small means, and the .overage consumer, ns •well as the average producer, are all alike helped by making conditions such that the man of exceptional business ability receives an exceptional reward for his ability. Something can be done by legislation to help the general pros perity but no such help of a perma nently beneficial character can be given -to the less able and less fortunate, save as the results of a policy which shall inure to the advantage of all industrious and efficient people who act decently. If, therefore, the less fortunate man is moved by envy of his more fortunate ^brother to strike at the conditions under which they have both, though unequally, prospered, the result will assuredly be •that while damage may come to the one •struck nt, it will visit with an even heav ier load the one who strikes the blow. Taken as a whole, we must all go up or •go down together. Cnrb fop Corporation*. It is true that where there is no gov ernmental restraint or supervision some •of the exceptional men use their energies not in ways that are for the common good, but in ways which tell against this •common good. The fortunes amassed through corporate organization are now so large, and vest such power in those that wield them, as to make it a matter of necessity to give to the sovereign— that is, to the government, which repre sents the people as a whole—some eft'ec •tive power of supervision over their cor porate use. In order to insure a healthy social and industrial life, every big cor poration should be held responsible by. and be accountable to. some sovereign strong enough to control its conduct. I am in no sense hostile to corpora tions. This is an age of combination, and any effort to prevent all combination •will be not only useless, but in the end Ticious, because of the contempt for law •which the failure to enforce law inevit ably produces. We should, moreover, recognize in cordial and ample fashion the immense good effected by corporate •agencies in a country such as ours, and the wealth of intellect, energy, and fidel ity devoted to their service, and there fore normally to the servico of the pub lic, by their officers and directors. The •corporation has come to stay, just as the trade union lias come to stay. Kach can •do and has done great good. Kach should be favored so long as it does good. But each should be sharply checked where it «cts against law and justice. So long as the finances of the nation are kept upon an honest basis no other question of internal economy with which the Con gress has the power to deal begins to approach in importance the matter of -endeavoring to secure proper industrial •conditions under which the individuals— and especially the great corporations— doing an interstate business are to act. The makers of our national constitution provided especially that the regulation -of interstate commerce should come -within the sphere of the general govern ment. The arguments in favor of their 'taking this stand were even then over whelming. But they are far stronger to-day, in view of the enormous develop ment of great business agencies, usually -corporate in form. Experience has •shown conclusively that it is useless to •try to get any adequate regulation and supervision of these great corporations 'by State action. Such regulation and •supervision can only be effectively exer •cised by a sovereign whose jurisdiction is co-extensive with the field of work of the corporations—that is. by the national .government. I believe that this regula tion and supervision can be obtained by the enactment of law by the Congress. If this proves impossible, it will certainly tie necessary ultimately to confer in full est form such power upon the national government by a proper amendment of the constitution. The Department of Justice has for the last four years deroted more attention to the enforcement of the anti-trust legisla tion than to anything else. Much has been accomplished particularly marked has been the moral effect of the prose cutions but it is increasingly evident that there will be a very insufficient "beneficial result in the way of economic change. The successful prosecution of •one device to evade the law immediately develops another derice to accomplish tie same purpose. What is needed is not sweeping prohibition of every arrange ment, good or bad, which may tend to restrict competition, but such adequate supervision and regulation as will pre vent any restriction of competition from being to the detriment of the public— as well as such supervision and regula tion as will prevent other abuses in no way connected with restriction of com petition. Of these abuses, perhaps, the chief, although by no means the only one, is overcapitalization—generally itself the Result of dishonest promotion—because of the myriad evils it brings in its train Cor such overcapitalization often means an inflation that invites business panic it always conceals the true relation of the profit earned to the capital actually invested, and it creates a burden of in terest payments which is a fertile causa of improper reduction in or limitation of wages it damages the small investor, discourages thrift, and encourages gam bling and speculation while perhaps worst of all is the trickiness and dishon esty which it implies—for harm to mor als is worse than •any possible harm to material interests, and the debauchery of politics and business by great dishon est corporations is far worse than any actual material evil they do the public. Until the national government obtains, th some manner which the wisdom of the Congress may suggest, proper control over the big ^corporations engaged in in terstate comthcree—that is, over the great majority of the big corporations— It will be impossible to deal adequately with these evils. Railroad Bate Herniation. The first thing to do is to deal with the great corporations engaged in the bufiitpss of interstate transportation. The immediate and most pressing need, so for as legislation y* concerned, is the en acin-.cm into aw «f some scheme to secure to the agents of the government such supervision and regulation of the rates charged by the railroads of the country engaged in interstate traffic as shall summarily and effectively prevent the imposition of unjust or unreasonable rates. It must include putting a com plete stop to rebates in every shape and form. This power to regulate rates, like all similar powers over the business world, should be exercised with modera tion. caution aud self-restraint but. it should exist, so tlmt it can be effectively csercised when the need arises. The first consideration to be kept in mind is that the power should be affirmative and should be given to some administrative body created by the Congress. If given to the present interstate commerce com mission or to a reorganized interstate commerce commission, such commission should l« made unequivocally adminis trative. I do not believe in the govern ment interfering with private business more than is necessary. 1 do not believe in the government undertaking any work which can willi propriety be left in pri vate hands. But neither do 1 believe in the government tlineliing from overseeing any work when it becomes evident that abuses are sure to obtain therein unless I here is governmental supervision. It is not my province to indicate the exact terms of the law which should be en acted but I call the attention of the Congress to curtain existing conditions with which it is desirable to deal. In my judgment the most important pro vision which stu-li law should contain is that conferring upon some competent ad ministrative body the power to dccide, upon the case being brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is reasonable and just, and if it is found to be unreasonable and un just, then, after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate beyond which it shall not be lawful to go—the maximum reasonable rate, as it is commonly called—this decision to go into effect within a reasonable time and to obtain from thence onward, subject to review by the courts. A heavy pen alty should be exacted from any corpora tion which fails to respect an order or the commission. Illegal transactions often occur under the forms of law. It has often occurred that a shipper has been told by a traffic officer to buy a large quantity of some commodity and then after it lias been bought an open reduction is made in the rate to take effect immediately, the ar rangement, resulting to the profit of the one shipper and the one railroad and to the damage of all their competitors for it must not bo forgotten that the big shippers are at least as much to blame as any railroad in the matter of rebates. The law should make it clear so that no body can fail to understand that any kind of .commission paid on freight ship ments, whether ill this form or in the form of fictitious damages, or of a con cession, a free pass, reduced passenger rate, or payment of brokerage, is illegal. It is worth while considering whether it would not be wise to confer on the government the right of civil notion against the beneficiary of a rebate for at least twice the value of the rebate this would help stop what is really black mail. Elevator allowances should be stopped, for they have now grown to such an extent that they are demoraliz ing and are used as rebates. The best possible regulation of rates would, of course, be that regulation se cured by an honest agreement among the railroads themselves to carry out the law. Such a general agreement would, for instance, at once put a stop to the efforts of any one big shipper or big rail road to discriminate against or secure advantages over some rival and such agreement would make the railroads themselves agents for enforcing the law. The power vested iii the government to put a stop to agreements to the detri ment of the public should, in my judg ment, be accompanied by power to per mit, under specified conditions and care ful supervision, agreements clearly in the interest of the public. All private-car lines, industrial roads, refrigerator charges, and the like should be expressly put under the supervision of the inter state commerce commission or some sim ilar body so far as rates, and agreements practically affecting ratts, are concerned. The private-car owners and the owners of industrm! rui'mnds «re entitled to a fair and reasonable compensation on their investment, but neither private cars nor industrial railroads nor spur tracks should be utilized as devices for securing preferential rates. A rebate in icing charges, or in mileage, or in a division of the rate for refrigerating charges is just as pernicious as a rebate in any other way. There should be publicity of the ac counts of common carriers no common carrier engaged in interstate business should keep any books or memoranda other than those reported pursuant to law or regulation, and these books or memoranda should be open to the inspec tion of the government. Only in this way can violations or evasions of the law be surely detected. A system of ex amination of railroad accounts should be provided similnr to that now conduct ed into the national bands by the bank examiners a few first-class railroad ac countants, if tlie.v had proper direction and proper authority to inspect books and papers, could accomplish much in preventing willful violations of the law. I urge upon the Congress the need of providing for expeditious action by the interstate commerce commission in all these matters. The question of transportation lies at the root of all industrial success, and the revolution in transportation which has taken place during the last half century has been the most important factor in the growth of the new industrial condi tions. Most emphatically we do not wish to see the man of great talents refused the reward for his talents. Still less do we wish to see him penalized but we do. desire to see the system of railroad transportation so handled that the strong man shall be given no advan tage over the weak man. We wish to insure as fair treatment for the small town as for the big city for the small shipper as for the big shipper. What we need to do is to develop an orderly system and such a system can only come through the gradually increased ex ercise of the right of efficient govern ment control. The Congress should provide, by ap propriate legislation, for the introduction of block signals upon all railroads en gaged in interstate commerce at the earliest practicable date, as a measure of increased safety to the traveling public. The excessive hours of labor to which railroad employes in train service are in many enses subjected is also a matter which may well engage the serious at tention of the Congress. Labor nn«l Capital. The national government has ns a rule but little occasion to deal with the formid able group of problems connected more or less directly with what Is known as the labor question, for In the great majority of cases these problems must be dealt with by the state and municipal authorities and not by the national government. Tbo. na tional government has control of the Dis trict of Columbia, however, and It should see to It that the city of Washington 1« made a model city In all respects. There has been demand for depriving courts of the power to issne' Injunctions in labor disputes. Sofh special limitation of the equity powers of our courts wonld be most unwise. It ts true that some judges have misused this power but this docs not Justify a denial of the power any more thai) an Improper exercise of the power to call a strike By-a labor leader would Justify the denial of the right to etri&e. Tire rem wlv is to regulate the procedure by requir ing the Judge to give due notice to tlie ad verse parties before granting the writ, the bearing to be ex parte If the adverts party does- not appear at the time and place or the recommendation 1 made In my last annual message for an Investiga tion by the department of commerce aud labor of general labor conditions, especlul attention to bo paid to the conditions of child labor and child labor legislation In the several States. Such an Investigation should take luto account the various prob lems with which the question of child labor Is connected. In such a republic as ours the ono thing that we cannot afford to neglect l»_the problem of turning out decent cltlxens. The future of the nation depends upon the citi zenship of the generations to come the children of to-day are those who to-morrow will shape the destiuy of our land, and we cannot afford to neglect them. The department of commerce and labor should also make a thorough investigation of the conditions of women In Industry. Over 6,000,000 American wom^n are now engaged In guluful occupations yet there Is an almost complete dearth of dutu upon which to base any trustworthy conclusions ns regards a subject as Important as it Is vast aud complicated. There Is need of full knowledge on which to base actiou looking toward State ami municipal legislation for the protection of working women. 'Wio in troduction of women Into Industry is work ing change and disturbance in the domestic and social life of the nation. The dccrenso lu marriage, and especially in the birth rate, has been coincident with it. "Wo must face accomplished facts, anil the adjust ment to factory conditions must be made, but surely it can bo made with less fric tion and less harmful effects on family life than Is now the case. In any great laiubor disturbance not only nre employer nod employe Interested, but also a third party—the general public. lCv cry considerable labor difficulty lu which interstate commerce Is Involved should be investigated by the government and the facts officially reported to the public. The question of securing a healthy, self respecting and mutually sympathetic nttl tude as between employer and employe, capitalist and wage worker, is a difficult one. Itut the underlying principles, the root principles, in accordance with which the problem must be solved are entirely simple. Wo can get justice and i"ij bt dealing only If we put as of paramount importance the principle of treating a man on his worth ns a man rather than with reference to his social position, his occu pation, or the class to which he belongs. There are selllsb and brutal men in all ranks of life. If they nre capitalists their selfishness and brutality may take the form of hard indifference to suffering, greedy disregard of every moral restraint which interferes with the accumulation of wealth, ami cold-blooded exploitation of the weak or, If they are laborers, the form of laziness, of sullen envy of the more fortunate, and of willingness to perform deeds of murderous violence. Such con duct is just as reprehensible in one ense' ns In the other, and all honest and fnr seelng men should join in warring against It wherever it becomes manifest. Individ ual capitalist and individual wage worker, corporation and union, are .alike entitled to the protection of the law, nud must alike obey the law. Moreover, 111 addition to mere obedience to the law, each man, if he be really a good citizen, must show broad sympathy for his neighbor and genu ine desire to look at any question nrising between them from the standpoint of that neighbor no less than from his own: and to tills end it Is essential that capitalist and wage worker should consult freely one with the other, should each strive to bring closep the day when both shall realize that they are properly partners and not ene les. This government Is not and never shall lie government by a plutocracy. Tills gov ernment Is not and never shall be govern ment by a uiob. It shall continue to be in the future What It has been iu the past, government based on the theory that euch man, rich or poor, Is to be treated simply and solely on his worth ns a man, tlint nil Ills personal and property rights nre to be safeguarded, and that he is neither to wrong others nor to suffer wrong from oth ers. Xceil of Insurance Reform, The great Insurance companies afford striking examples of corporations whose business has extended so far beyond the jurisdiction of the States which created them as to preclude strict enforcement of supervision and regulation by the parent States. In my Inst annual message I recom mended "that the Congress carefully con sider whether the power of the bureau of corporations can not constitutionally be ex tended to cover interstate transactions In insurance." Kecent events have emphasized the importance of an early and exhaustive consideration of this question, to see wheth er it is not possible to furnish better safe guards than the several States have been able to furnish against corruption of the flagrant kind which has been exposed. It has been only too clearly shown that cer tain of the men at the head of these large corporations take but small note oC the ethical distinction between honesty and dis honesty they draw the line only this side of what may be called law-honesty, the kind of henesty necessary In order to avoid falling Into the clutcties of the law. Of course the only complete remedy for this condition mnst be found in an aroused pub lic conscience, higher sense of-ethical con duct In the community at large, and espe cially among business men and lu the great profession of the law. and in the growth of a spirit which condemns all dishonesty, whether in rich man or Iv joor man, wheth er It takes the shape of brtoery or of black mail. But much can be done by legislation which Is not only drastic but practical. There Is need of a far stricter and more uniform regulation of the vast insurance Interests of tills country. The United States should In this respect follow the poiicy of other nations by providing ade quate national supervision of commercial Interests which are clearly national lu char acter. Revenues and Expenditures. There Is more need of stability than of the attempt to attain an ideal perfection In the methods of raising revenue and the shock and strain to the business world cer tain to attend «ny serious change in these methods render nuch change Inadvisable un less for grave renson. There must be something like a general agreement among the citizens of tile several States, as rep resented in (.he Congress, that the change is needed anil desired in the interest of the people as a whole: nnd there should then bo a sincere, intelligent nnd disinterested effort to make it in such'shape ns will com bine, so far as possible, the maximum of good to the people nt Inrgo with the mini mum of necessnry disregard for the special interests of localities or classes. Unless our expenditures enn be kept within the revenues then our revenue laws must be re adjusted. It should bo considered whether It Is not desirable that the tariff laws should pro vide for applying as agninst or In favor of any other nation maximum and mlulmura tariff rates established by the Congress, so as to secure certain reciprocity of treat ment between other nations aud ourselves. Oar Currency S-«4cm. Every consideration of prudence de mands the addition of the clement of elas ticity to our currency system. The evil does not consist In an Inadequate volume of mouey, but In the ridigity of this vol ume. which docs not respond as It should to the varying needs of communities and of seasons. Inflation must be avoided bat some provision should be mnde that will insure a larger volume of money during the fall and winter months than In the less active seasons of the year so that the currency will contract against speculation, and will expand for the needs of leglti-,. mate business. Purity of Federal Election*. The power of the government to protect the Integrity of the elections of Its own officials Is Inherent and has been recognized and affirmed by repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy of free government more dangerous and none so Insidious as the corruption of the elec torate. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and corrup tion in federal elections. Such a law should include severe penalties against Jiim who gives or receives a bribe intended to Influence his act or opinion as an elect or and "provisions for the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations and elections of all candidates, but nlso of ail contributions received and expenditures mnde by political committees. In political campaigns In ft country as large nnd populous ns ours It Is inevitable that there should be much expense of an entirely legitimate, kind. This, of course, means that many contributions, and some of them of large size, must be made, and, as a matter.of fact, in any big political contest such contributions nre always mnde to both sides. It is entirely proper both to give aud receive them, unless there is an Improper motive connected With either gift or reception, if they are extorted by any kind of pressure or promise, express or implied, direct or Indirect, In the way of favor or Immunity, then the giving o/ receiving becomes not ouly Improper but criminal. If It Is possible to secure by law the full nnd verified publication in detail of all the snms contributed to nnd expend ed by the candidates or committees of any political parties the result cannot bnt le wholesome. All contributions by corporations to any political committed or for any political par pose should be forbidden by law directors should not be permitted to nse stockhold ers' money for such purposes and, more-, over, a prohibition of this kind would be as far as It went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at In-corrupt prac tlct*s net The Canlog Hague Conference. The first conference of nations held at The in 18911, being uu»ulv iv of all the business before It, recommended the consideration and settlement of a num ber of Important questions by another con ference to be called subsequently and at an early date. In October, 1004, at the In stance of the Interparliamentary Union, I issued Invitations to u11 the powers signa tory to The Hague convention to send dele gates to such a conference and suggested that It be again held at The Hague. From all the powers acceptance was received, coupled In some cases with the condition that we should wait until the end of the war then waging between Itussla and Ja pan. The lSmperor of Itussla, Immediately after the treaty of penco which so happily terminated this war. In a note presented to the President on Sept. 13, through Aui bassudor Rosen, took the initiative In rec ommending that the conference be 'now called. The United Slates government In response expressed Its cordial acquies cence. We assume tHat nil civilized govern ments will support the movement, nud thiit the conference Is now an assured fact. This renders it proper at tills time to say something ns to the general attitude of this government toward peace. A wanton or useless war, or war of mere aggresslon- in short, nny wur begun or carried on In a conscienceless spirit. Is to be condemned ns peculiarly atrocious crime against all humanity. We can, however, do nothing of permanent value for peace unless we keep ever clearly In mind the ethical ele ment which lies at the root of the prob lem. Our aim is righteousness, l'eace Is normally the handmaiden of righteousness but when peace and righteousness conflict then great and upright people can never for a moment hesitate to follow the path which leads toward righteousness, even though that path also leads to war. There can be no worse foe of mankind In gen eral, nnd of his own country ill particular, than the demagogue of war. the man who In mere folly or to serve his own selfish ends continually rails at nnd abuses other natlo^i, who seeks lo excite his country men against foreigners on lnsufllclent pre texts, who excites and Inllames a perverse and aggressive national vanity, and who may on occasions wantonly bring on con flict* between his untlou and some other na tion. Itut there ore demagogues of peace Just as there are demagogues of wnr, nnd In any such movement as this for The Hague conference It Is es sential not to be misled by one set of extremists uuy more than by the other. object is better worthy tile attention of enlightened statesmanship than the es tablishment of surer method than now exists of securing Justice as between nn tIons, both for the protection of the little nations nnd for tile prevention of wnr be tween the big nations. To this aim we should endeavor not only to avert blood shed, but, above nil, effectively to strength en the forces of right. The golden rule should be. and as the world grows in morality It will be, the guiding rule of con duct among nations ns among Individuals though the golden rule must not be con strued, in fantastic manner, as forbidding the exercise of the police power. This mighty and free republic should ever deal with alt other States, great'or small, on basis of high honor, respecting their rights as Jealously ns It safeguards its own. Expounds the Monroe Doctrine. One of the most effective Instruments for peace Is the Monroe doctrine as It has been and Is being gradually developed by this nation nnd accepted by other nations. No other policy could have been ns efficient in promoting peace In the western hemisphere and 111 giving to each nation thereou the chance to develop along Its own lines. If we had refused to apply the doctrine to changing conditions It would now be com pletely outworn, would not meet nny of the needs of the present day, and Indeed would probably by this time have sunk luto com plete oblivion. It is useful nt home, and is meeting with recognition abroad becnuse we have adapted our application of It to meet the growing and changing needs of the hemisphere. That our rights nnd Inter estsaredecply concerned 111 the maintenance of the doctrine is so clear as hnnlly to need argument. This is especially true in view of the construction of the Panama canal. There are certain essential points which must never bo forgotten us regards the Monroe doctrine. 1't must be understood that under no circumstances will the Uni ted States use the Monroe doctrine as a cloak for territorial aggression. V'e desire peace with all the world, bnt perhaps most of all with the other peoples of the Ameri can continent. Moreover, we must make It evident that we do not Intend to permit the Monroe doctrine to be used by any nation on this continent as a shield to protect It from the consequences of Its own misdeeds against foreign nations. If a republic to the south of us commits a tort against foreign nation, such ns an outrage agaliiBt a citizen of that nation, then the Monroe dectrlne does not force us to interfere to prevent punishment of the tort, saro4.o see that the punishment does not assume the form of territorial occupation In nny shape. Urges Santo Domliigro Action. Santo Domingo, In her turn, has made an appeal to us to help her, and not ouly every principle of wisdom but every gen erous instinct within us Idds us respond to the appeal. The conditions in Santo Domingo have for number of years grown from bad to worse until a year ago nil society wns ou the verge of dis solution. Fortunately, just at tills time a ruler sprang up ill Santo Domingo, who, with his colleagues, saw the dangers threatening their country nnd appealed to the friendship of the only great aud power ful neighbor who postassed the power, and as they hoped nlso the will to help them. There was imminent danger of foreign in tervention. The previous rulers of Santo Domingo una recklessly incurred deuis, una owing to her interna! disorders she had ceased to be able to provide means of pay ing the debts. The patience of her foreign creditors had become exhausted, and nt least two foreign nations were on the point of intervention, nnd were only prevented from Intervening by the unofficial assurance of this government that It would itself strive to help Santo Domingo In her hour of need. In the case of one of these nations, only the actual opening of negotia tions to thfs end by our government pre vented the seizure of territory lu Santo Domingo by a European power. Of the debts Incurred some were Just, while some were not of a character which really ren ders It obligatory on, or proper for. Santo Domingo to pay them in full. But she could not pay any of them unless some stability was assured her government and people. Accordingly the executive department of our government negotiated a treaty under which we are to try to help the Dominican people to straighten out their finances. This treaty Is pending before the Senate. In the meantime a temporary arrangement has been made which will last until the Senate has had time to take action upon the treaty. Under this arrangement the Do minican government has appointed Ameri cans to all the Important positions in the customs service, and they nre seeing to the honest collection of the revenues* turning over 45 per cent to the government for run ning expenses and putting the other 55 per cent Into a safe depositary for equitable division, in case the treaty shall be rntiSed, among the various creditors, whether Euro pean or American. This has completely discouraged all revo lutionary movement, while it has already produced such an Increase In the revenues that the government Is actually getting more from the 45 per cent that the Ameri can collectors turn over to It than it got formerly when it took the entire revenue. Under the course tnken, stability and order and all the benefits of peace are at last coming .to Santo Domingo, danger of foreign Intervention has been suspended, nnd there Is at last a prospect thnt nil creditors will get justice, no more and no less. If tbe arrangement Is terminated by the failure of the treaty chaos will follow nnd if "chaos follows, sooner or later this government may lie Involved In serious dif ficulties with foreign governments over the Island, or else may he forced Itself to In tervene In the island In some uupleasaut fashion. Army and Navy Affairs. We cannot consider the question of our foreign policy without at the same time treating of the army and the navy. We now have a very small army—Indeed, one well-nigh infinitesimal when compared with the army of any other large nation. Of course the army we do have should be as nearly perfect of Its kind and for Its size as Is possible. I do not lielleve that any army In the world has lietter average of enlisted men or a better type of jnulor of ficer but the army should be trained to act effectively In a mass. Provision should be made by sufficient appropriations for maneuvers of a practical kind, so that the troops may learn how to take care of them selves under actual service conditions. Our navy must, relatively to the navies of other nations, always be of greattr size than our army. We have most wisely con tinued for a nutnber of years to build up our navy, nnd it has now reached a fairly high standard of efficiency. This standard of efficiency must not only be maintained, bnt increased. It does not seem to ne. necessary, however, that the navy should— at least In the Immediate future—be In creased beyond tbe present number of units. What Is now clearly necessary is to substitute efficient for inefficient units' as the latter become worn-out or 'ns It be comes apparent thnt they are useless. Recent naval history has emphasized cer tain lessons which ought not to, but which do, need emphasis. Seagoing torpedo boats or destroyers ,are Indispensable, .not only for waking night attacks by surprise upon an enemy, but even in battle for finishing already crippled, ships. Upder exceptional circ-uinsu*ri5 Suuffiarluc bjsts would dcubt iwi lie of use. Fast scouts nre needed.

Heavy-srmcd cruisers also play a uiost useful part, and unarmed cruisers, if iwlft enough, are very useful as scouts. Abuaea iu Naturalisation. During the past year evidence has accu mulated to confirm the expressions con tained In my Inst two annual messages as lo the importance of revising by appropri ate legislation our system of naturalizing aliens. I appointed lust March a conuuis make a careful examination sion to make a careful examination of The creation of small Irrigated farms un der the reclamation act Is a powerful offset to the tendency of certain other laws to foster or penult monopoly of the land. The greater part of the remaining public lands cannot be irrigated. They are at present aad will probably always le of greater valuo for grazing than for any other purpose. This fact has led to the grazing homestead of 010 acres In Nebras ka and to the proposed extension of It to other States. It is argued thnt A fahilly cannot be supported on 100 acres of arid grazing land. This is obviously true but neither can a family be supported on (WO acres of much of the land to wlitcli It Is proposed to apply the grazing homestead. To establish universally any such arbitrary limit would be unwise at the present time. Alerchant Marine Inli«pcn«ablc* To the spread of our trade in peace and the defense of our flag In war a great and prosperous merchant marine Is Indispensa ble. We should have ships of our own aud seamen of our own to convey our goods to neutral markets, aud in case of ueed to re inforce our battle line. Pensions for Civil War Soldier.*. It 1s a matter of unmixed satisfaction once utore to call attentlou to the excellent work of the pension bureau for the veter ans of the Civil War have a greater claim upon us than any other class of otir citi zens. To them, tlrst of all among our peo ple, houor Is due. Seven years ago my la mented predecessor, President McKlule.v, stated that the time had come for the na tion to care for the graves of the Coufed* crate dead. 1 recommend that the Con gress take action toward this end. The lmiulurrutlon Question. The question of Immigration Is of vital interest to this country. In the year end ing June ao, lSHi5t there cume to the T'wiled States 1,020,000 alien Immigrants. It is clearly shown In the report of the obm mlssioner general of Immigration that while much of this enormous Immigration Is undoubtedly healthy and natural, con siderable proportion is undesirable from one reason or another moreover, a consid erable proportion of It, probably very large proportion, Including most of the un desirable cluss, does not come here of its own Initiative, but because of the activity of the agents of the great transportation companies. We cannot have too much Immigration of the right sort, and we should have none whatever of the wrong sort. Of course It Is desirable that even the right, kind of im migration should he properly distributed in tills country. Wc need more of such immi gration for the South nnd special effort should be iriade to secure it. In actual practice it has proved so difficult to en force the Immigration ia-ws where loug stretches of frontier marked by an imagin ary line alone intervene between us nnd our neighbors that I recommend that uo Immigrants be allowed to come In front Canada and Mexico, save natives of the two countries themselves. As much as pos sible should be done to distribute the Immi grants upon the land and keep them away from the congested tenement-house dis tricts of the great cities. But distribution Is a palliative, not a cure. The prime need Is to keep out all immigrants who will not make good American citizens. The laws now existing for the exclusion of undesirable imiulgrnuts should be strengthened. Adequate means Bliould be adopted, and enforced by sufficient penal ties. to compel steamship companies eu gaged In tbe passenger business to observe in good faith the iuw which fOrulua them to encourage or solicit immigration to tbe United States. Provision should be made for the surer punishment of those who in duce aliens to come to this country under promise or assurance of employment. It Bliould be made possible to inflict a suQi clently heavy penalty on any employer vio lating this law to deter him from taking the risk. It seems to me wise that there should be nn international conference held to deal with this question of Immigration, which has more than a' merely national significance. The questions arising In connection with Chinese Immigration stand by themselves. The conditions lu China are such that the entire Chinese coolie class, that Ih, the class of Chinese laborers, skilled and un skilled, legitimately come under the head of undesirable immigrants to this country, because of their numbers, the low wages for which they work, and their low stand ard of living. Not only Is It to the Interest of this country to keep them out, but the Chinese authorities do not desire thnt they should be ad mitted. At present their entrance Is prohibited by laws amply adequate to accomplish this purpose. Itut in the effort to carry out the policy of excluding Chi nese laborers. Chinese coolies, grave injus tice aud wrong have been done by this nation to the people of China, and there fore ultimately to this nation Itself. Chi nese students, business and professional men of all kinds—not only merchants, but bunkers, doctors, manufacturers, professors, travelers and the like—should be encour aged to come here and treated on precisely the same footing that we treat Students, business men, Jrnvelers and the like of other nations. Our laws and treaties should he framed, not so as to put these people in the excepted classes, but to state that we will admit all Chinese, except Chinese of the coolie class, Chinese skilled or un skilled laborers. Much trouble has come during the past glimmer from the organized boycott against American goods which has been started in China. Tbe main factor in producing this boycott has been the resentment felt by the students nnd business people of China, by all the Chinese leaders, against the harehnes* of our law toward educated Chinamen of the professional and business classes. This government has the friendli est feeling, for China and desires China's well-being. AVe cordially sympathize with the announced purpose of Japan to stand for the integrity of China, finch nn atti tude tends to the peace of the world. Adulteration of Foods. I recommend that law be enacted to regnlate Interstate commerce In inlsbrand ed and adulterated foods, drinks, and drugs. Such law Would protect legitimate manu facture and commerce, nnd would tend to secure the health nnd welfare of the con suming public. Traffic ill foodstuffs which have been debiised.'or adulterated so ns to Injure ftenlth or to deceive purchasers should be forbidden. National I'nrltn nnd Show Places. I call your attention to the generous net of the State of California in conferring npon the United States government the ownership of the Yosemitc Valley and the Mariposa Big Tree grove. There should be no delay in accepting the gift, and appro priations should be made for the Including thereof in the Yosemitc National Park, and for the care and policing of the park. Cal ifornia has actcd most wisely as well as with great magnanimity in the matter. There arc certain mighty natural features of our laud which should be preserved In perpetuity for our children and our chil dren's children. In my Judgment tbe Grand Canyon of the Colorado should he mnde into a national park. It is greatly to he wished that the State of New York should copy ns regards Niagara what the State of California has done as regards the Yosem itc. Nothing should be allowed to Interfere witb the preservation of Niagara Falls in all their beauty and majesty. Pensions tor Litc-Sareni. cull your especially attention to the de sirability of giving to the members of tbe lifesavlng aervlce pensions euch ag afe giv *r, to firemen and policemen in ail onr great cities. It Is unjust for a great nation Mks this to permit these men to become totally disabled or to meet death In the perform ance of their hazardous duty and yet to give them no sort of reward. The Philippine Islands. During the pnst year the Philippine Isl ands have been slowly recovering front tbe scries of disasters which, since Amcrl can occupation, have greatly reduced the nmonnt ot agricultural products below ... what wns produced lu Spanish times. The wnr, our naturalization laws, aud to Bug- drought, nnd the cholera have been united gent appropriate measures to avoid the has riiwhurtfetl the duty Imposed upon It, and has submitted a report* which will lu* transmitted to the Congress for Its onu bidtriitlon, and, I hope, for its favorable action. llrea-clic* of Trust In Public Services There seems to le no statute of the Uni ted .States which provides for the punlKli miMit ot' a tailed States attorney or other olHeer of ho iruvcniiiuMit who corruptly agrees to wrongfully do or wrongfully re frain from dohi£ any net when the consid eration for sueh corrupt agreement lb oth er than one possessing money value. This ought ta be remedied by appropriate legis lation. I.e^islntlu shuld also bo enacted to cover, explicitly, unequivocally and be yond question, breach of trust lu the shape of prematurely divulging ottielhl secrets by an ('Ulcer or employe of the United States, md to provide a suitable penally therefor, of I'nldlc Lnad "L I'oiiditlou Once again I call your attention to the condition of the public laud laws. Ucccnr developments have given uew urgency to the need for such changes as will ttt thes« laws to actual present conditions. The honest disposal and right use of the re maining public lauds Is of fundamental Im portance. The iniquitous methods by which the monopolizing of the public lands is be ing brought about under the present laws are becoming more generally known, but the existing laws do nut furnish effective remedies. The recommendation of the pub lic land* commission upon this subject uro wise and should be given effect. the rinderpest, the locusts, the n!J Iiotorloua abuses resulting from tlio perny much needed in the islands. The Improvident or unlawful granting Income of the l'hlllpplno government has of citizenship. 'this commission, necessarily been rcdived by renson of the enuscs to prevent a return of the pros- business and agricultural depression In tha Islands, and the government has been obliged to exercise greut economy, to cut down its expenses, to reduce salaries, and in evij-y way to avoid a deficit. It has adopted nu Internal-revenue law Imposing taxes on cigars, cigarettes, and distilled liquors, and abolishing the old Spanish Industrial taxes. Tha come derived fruni It lias partly made up for the reduction In customs revenue. There lias been a marked lncreaso In the number of Killplnos employed In the civil service, and a corresponding decreuse in the lum ber of Americans. Improvements of harbors, roads, nnd bridges continue, although the cutting down of the revenue forbids the expenditure of any great amount from current Income for these purposes. Disturbances have all now been suppressed, and It is hoped that with tlieso lessons local governments can be formed which will secure unlet nnd |eace to the deserving Inhabitants. The Inci dent Is nnother proof of the fact that If there has been any error as regards giving self-government In the Philippines It has been In the direction of giving It too quick ly, not too slowly. The agricultural conditions of tbe islands enforce mure strongly than ever the argu ment in favor of reducing the tariff on tbo products of the Philippine i'slauds entering the United States. I earnestly recommend that the tariff now imposed by the Blngley bill upon the products of the Philippine Isl ands be entirely removed, except the tariff on sugar ami tobacco, and that that tariff be reduced to 'Jj per cent of the present rates under the lllngley net that after July 1, l'.Mip, the tariff upon tobacco and sugar produced In the Philippine Islands be entirely removed, and that free trade between the Islands anil the United Stales In the products of each country then bo provided for by law. Problem* of Hnwnli. In my judgment Immediate steps should lie tnken for the fortlllcutlon of Hawaii. 'Uhis Is tlie most important point iu the Pa cific to fortify in order to conserve the In terests of this country, l/aivall is too hottv lly (axed. Laws should be enacted setting aside for a period of, say, twenty years, 75 per cent of the Internal revenue nnd cus toms receipts from Hawaii ns a special fund to lie expended in the islauds for educa tional nud public buildings, and for harbor Improvements and military and naval de fenses. Hawaii has serious commercial and industrial problems to reckon with but no measure or relief can be considered which looks to legislation admitting Chinese and restricting them by statute to Held labor and domestic service. The statns of ser vility can never ugaln be tolerated on Amer ican soil. Porto Rlcati AfTaira. I earnestly advocnte the adoption of leg islation which Will explicitly confer Amer ican citizenship 011 nil citizens of Porto Klco. Tile problems and needs of the island are industrial and commercial rather than political. Iiijtulnr AfTnlr.1 In General, I wish nlso to call the attention of the Congress to one question which affccts ot-.r Insular posnesslons generally nnme ly, the need of ail Increased liberality In the treatment of the whole franchise quest [0:1 lu these Islands, lu the proper desire to prevent the islands being ex ploited by speculators and to liavu tlipin develop In the Interest of theiT own people nil error has been made In re fusing to grant sutllcleutly liberal terms to Induce the Investment of American capital In the Philippines and in Porto Klco. Wo have been paying nil possible heed to the political and educational interests of the islands, but, Important though these ob jects are, It Is not less Important that we should favor their industrial development. Aliiiiix.inn (v Biuieiivuil, I recommend that Indian Territory and Oklahoma be admitted ns one State and that New Mexico and Arizona be admitted as one Stnte. There Is no justification for further delay and the advisability of mak ing the fonr territories Into two States has been clearly established. Th» Panama Canal. The treaty between the United State* and the Republic of Panama, under which the construction of tbe Panama canal was made possible, went Into effect with Its ratification by tbe United States Senate ou Feb. 23, 1U04. Tbe canal properties of the French Canal Company were trans ferred to the United States on April 2a, 1004, on payment of $40,000,000 to that company. Active work in canal construc tion, mainly preparatory, has been in progress for less than a year and a half. During that period two points about the canal have ceased to be open to debate. First, the question of route tbe canal wlil be built on the Isthmus of I'auniiia. Sec ond, the question of feasibility there are no physical obstacles 011 this route that American engineering skill will not be able to overcome without serious uimcutty, or that wiii prevent the completion of the canal within a reasonable time and at a reasonable cost. The point which remains unsettled is the question of type, whether the canal shall be one of several locks above sea level) or at sea level with a single tide lock. On this point I hope to lay before the Con gress at on early day the findings of tha advisory board of American and European engineers, thnt at my Invitation have been considering the subject, together with tha report of the commission thereon and snch comments thereon or recommendations lu reference thereto as may seem necessary. The American people arc pledged to the speediest possible construction of a canal ndequate to meet the dunands which the commerce of the worM} frill make upon It, and I appeal most earnestly to the Con gress to aid in the fulfillment of tbe pledge. Gratifying progress has been made during the past year and especially durlug the post four months. The greater part of the necessary preliminary work has been done. Actual work of excavation could be begun only on a limited scale till the canal zone was made a healthful place to live In nnd to work In. The Istlunus had to be sanitated first. This tnsk has been so thoroughly accomplished that yellow fever lias been virtually extirpated from the Isthmus nud general health conditions vastly Improved. In addition to sanitating the isthmus, satisfactory quarters are being provided for employes nnd an ndequate system of supplying them with wholesome food ut reasonable prices has been created. Iiospltuls have been estab lished and equipped that are with out superiors of their kind anywhere. During the pnst year a large portion of the plant with which the work is to be 

CONGRESS Tho Senate convened at noon Monday, nnd prayer wns offered by Edward Ever ett Hale, the chaplain. Sixty-eight Seu r.tors responded to the roll call, arid th* oath was administered to the new mem bers. Senators Allison and Morgan wer® appointed to wait upon the President, with a similar committee from tha House. Resolutions in memory of th« late"Senator Piatt of Connecticut were passed. The House convened at 12 o'clock, and Joseph G. Cannon of Illinois was re-elected Speaker, over John Sharp Williams of Mississippi. Officers of th« House wero sworn in and the oath ad ministered to new members. The rules of tho Fifty-eighth Congress were adopt ed, and seats were assigned by lot. Many important bills were introduced. Tho Senate gave practically nil of Its tlmo Tuesday to listening to the tending of the President's message. The docu ment received the closest attention. Prea» ideut Roosevelt's message received ths attention of tho House for two and half hours, nnd it was applauded. Ths House received nnd ordered referred to one of the regular election committees protest from tho Fifth Congressional District of Illinois stating that Arit&ony Michnlek, who was sworn In ns a mem ber of the House from that district. Is not a citizen of the United States. Up on motion of Mr. Uoldfoglo of New York a resolution was read expressing, ths sympathy of the American people for ths distressed Russian Jews.. The Senate began business in earnest Wednesday, several hundred bills and resolutions being Introduced. A resolu tion directing the committee on judi ciary to inquire into and report wheth er under tho Constitution Congress has authority to supervise marine, fire and life insurance was adopted without de bate. At 1:50 p. m. the Senate went rieveUr that"by'uif'mld'dle9 amination under the direction of the 1, nroaehinK year a sufficient proportion of this plant will have been Installed to en able us to resume the work of excavation on largo scale. What Is needed now and without delay Is an appropriation by the Congress to meet the current and aeernltig expenses of the commission. The first appropriation of 410, 100,000, out of the $135,000,000 authorized bv the Spooner act. was made three years ago It Is nearly exhausted. There is barely enough of It reinalnhig to carry the commission to the end of the year. Un less tho Congress sjiall appropriate before thnt time all work must cease, aud there will lie demoralization of the forces, here nnd on tbe Isthmus, now working so har monlouslr and effectively. If there Is delay In granting au emergency appropriation. The Department of State. I recommend more adequate provision than has been made heretofore for the work or the department of state. Within a few years there has been a very great increase In the amount and importance of the work to be done by that department, both in Washington and abroad. Neither at homo nor abroad Is there a sufficient working force to do tbe business properly. Our consular force should be classilled, and ap polut incuts should be made to the several classes, with authority to the executive to assign the members of each class to duty nt such posts ns the interests of the serv ice require. Instead of the appointments be ing made as at present to specified posts. Sufficient provision should be made for a cloi-iu-.l force lu every consulate, composed entirely of Americans. Instead of the in sufficient provision now made, which com •pels tbe employment of great numbers of citizens of foreign countries whose serv ices can be obtained for less money. Suitable provision should be made for the expense of keeping our diplomatic officers more fully Informed of what is being dono from day. to day in the progress of our diplomatic affairs with other countries.
