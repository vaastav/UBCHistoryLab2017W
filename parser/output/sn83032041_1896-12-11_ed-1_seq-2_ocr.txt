' Congress met on Monday and the last message of President Cleveland to thai hotly was read. The message is lengthj and deals entirely in statistics but sug gests nothing of any importance. Oi the Cuban question, Mr. Cleveland, evi dently intends to do nothing, leaving thi Cubans to work out their own independ ence without any help from him. Madrid newspapers are greatly excit ed over their references to Cuba and Spain contained in President Cleveland's message and declare the intervention ol the United States in Cuba would be uu- lktfvu im f1 v Kuril iliatatine to Spain. Ei Oorrfxttomlrncia MUiMry says that Spain has forces more than sufficient to pun ish an interference on the part of the United States in the affairs of Spain. A company with acapitalof $20:000, 000 has been incorporated ander the laws of Virginia to engage in exporting and importing with South America re publics. Its privileges in the way ol absorbing and freezing out other con cerns are of the most liberal character Among other purposes in view is said ti be the development and exportation ol anthracite coal from the rich fields oi Peru. The house committee on banking and currency at its meeting at Washington on Wednesday decided that some steps should be taken by them to "correct the I evils in our banking aud currency 6)8- tem." A resolution offeredby Mr. Bio- aius, of Pennsylvania, was unanimously adopted. It reads: "Re olved, That with a view to obtaining the latest and best thought on the subject of our finan cial and banking system, this commit tee invites suggestions and communica tions from financial, commercial and in dustrial organizations which may have any definite plan to present on the sub- j !Ct. More McKinley prosperity. Wages of all employes of the Illinois Steel com pany, Chicago were reduced from 10 to 25 per cent, on December 1. Moter- men and conductors of the Consolidated Traction company, Pittsburg, have been subjected to a reduction of wages from 10 to II 57 a day. The extensive plant of the Roxbury, Mass.. Carpet company has closed down indefinitely, it is me largest concern of its kind in New England and employed 1,200 peo ple. Fifty employee of the finishing de partment of W. B. Thorn fc Co's. shoe factory, Haverllill, Mass., have been paid off and discharged. Judging from the increasing demand from foreign countries for American iron it does not stand in much need of protective duties. A late dispatch from Birmingham, Ala., anounces sales of 3,000 tons for Liverpool, and also orders for Rotterdam, Genoa and other points in foreign countries. A constant mar ket for surplus southern iron outside of the United States seems to be an assured feature of future business. An order is reported from Detroit for 2,000 tons of pig iron for Budapest of a peculiar char acter, to be used in the manufacture of car wheels. But the more finished pro duct of northern manufactories is also finding a market abroad. The increased exportation of manufactured goods is one of the great triumphs of the Wilson tariff imperfect as it is. Uuder uo form er tariff law has there been such pro gress in this direction. The Philadelphia Recojul is correct, ssys the New York World, asserting that while the iron manufacturers of this country are calling for more protection, Alabama iron is celling in Europe in open competition with the cheapest products of European labor. CThis is true not only of pig-iron but of cut and wire nails, of bicycles, sewing machiens and many other forms of it on and steel goods which are exported and sold in Europe at a profit, and without any protection whatever. It is also true that the very time our manufacturers are demanding increased protection against foreigners they are selling to foreigners cheaper than they sell at home. How is it that American steel rails are worth Jess a mile ontside of our coast limit than they are on our wharves? How is it that our coal is sold for 50 cents a ton less in Hamburg than in New lork? Instead of an iacrease of tariff taxes, why should we not have fair trade prices at home as well as abioad? Osb factor in the resources of the Uni ted States for defense or aggression, an English writer. Mr. Stevens, points out which no other Englishman has reck oned with. He remarks: "At present the United States govern ment pays $138,000,000 a year to pen sioners of the civil war. As the men die these pensions fall in at the rate of five to eight millions annually; in 20 years or so the pension list will be a white 6heet of paper. That means over twenty-six millions sterling a year paid already for a military purpose which can be diverted to armaments without a cent of extra taxation. In 20 years this country will be easily able to turn out a dozen battleships a year without taking a cent out of anybody's pocket. And that means the naval supremacy of the world. "If we started the United States in this course by some bungling attempt to get our coaling stations half fortified then it was the worst day's work ever did in our lives. But since the mischief is done, and apparently done irremedia bly, we had better face the situation gijuarely and at once." It appears to be the belief of a great many men elected to legislative bod ins. says the Hsrristmrg l'afruX, mat u their business to introduce bil.s, next to introduce more bil's and last to hare bills introduced. Ti such decree ha 'his belief l-en impressed upon the Hinds of the c h- sen of the people, and upon some of the people also, that man who serves through a vhole ses sion of a legislature without introducing a few bills it mikes no difference if they be smothered in committee irn me diately is looked upon as lacking in telligence or at leat he is suspected of sort of crank. There are naHy fifteen hundred bills, r ported from committees, awaiting tne action of the second session of the Fifty fourth congress. In congress as else where a large number of bills never get beyond the committees. The sum total ..f bills introduced is therefore much larger than the number now awaiting tction. Congressmen cover mutn mure territoiv that is their districts are larger than do the members of the stUe leg islatures and they have more valid ex cuses for the introduction of many bills Bat the average State legislature wrest le ;h mnre bills in one session than congress does in two. Next month eve ry member of the legislature w o per colates into this town will have a grip sack, boots and breeches filled with bills that the great American people want converted into laws the said American people being the Jim Smiths and Sam innKM. each of whom controls a vote down at the Corners, or the Bill Flushes or Tom Kuockouts who run the biggest saloons in the block. Very many of these bills are desert ed as soon as they come into the world, many are deservedly killed in commit tee, but the great maj jrity are placed on ih calendar, worthless as thev are. and impede action on other measures which are more deserving or more important But too many unnecessary bills find their wav to the st itute books. There are scarcely six biilj introduced in any session of the legisature that are worth a mo nent's attention by men devoted to the interests of the state. And of these more deserving six, not less than three are killed because they are too honest. The man who does not intro duce a bill now is the real statesman. The State convention of county com missioners of Pennsylvania held at Reading recently discussed a number of questions of great importance to the tax oa vers of the state. Doe of them was as to whether justices of the peace shotdd bs multched for costs in the petty case: returned to court without sufficient cause. Ihe courts of quar er sessions of every county in the state have had numberless cases of this character to deal with, and if the county commission ers will secure the pafsage of a law such as they will recommend for imposing the costs upon the justices and magis trates who make return of petty cases on flimsy or unseasonable evidence, they will save large sums of money annually to the taxpayers. Probably one of the most important questions discussed was that of registra tion. The convention decided to re commend the single annual registiation, and the doing away with the May regis tration. This, if passed and it becomes a law, will save the counties of the state a great deal of money yearly, as well as avoid the performance of work that is really unnecessary. Among other matters up for consider ation was that of praying the state leg islature to amend the state constitution so as to classify the cities and boroughs of the state to the end that all public of ficers shall be paid salaries instead of re ceiving fees, as at present. The fee sys tem they declare, has been found unsat isfactory and burdensome and if the wishes of the county commissioners are granted a great and beneficial reform will have been brought about. Alto gether the annual sessions of the county commissioners are certain to work a great deal of good to the people of the state. If anything were needed in addition to the outgivings of liepublican states men fresh from Canton to indicate the intention of the victors in regard to the tariff, a full blown hint could be plucked from the list of demands to be made of congress by the California Fruit Grow ers' Convention. No doubt there is plenty of evidence to prove that these demands are not merely perfectly rea sonable and proier, but that compli ance with them will be of great advan tage to everybody. 1 'ersons who want goveimental bounties are always pre- Pa"ed to demonstrate complete unselfish Dess aud "Otous patriotism. California is first in the field. Now let us hear from the wool growers, the salt miners, the lumbermen, the mill bosses, and all the noble army of mar tyrs to the wickedVilson bill. It is an nounced that Major McKinley intends to put in the winter framing a tariff bill to be presented to the extra session be means to call directly after his inaugur ation. How can he do it unless the va rious mendicants of trade make baste to tell him what they want? Step up ev erybody, and hand in your list of de mands! We are going to have a feast as will be a feast. Walk up to the table, gentlemen! Nobody shall be sent away hungry. Senator Miixe, of Texas, on Wednes day introduced the following resolution in the senate: Resolved, by the senate and house of representatives of the United States of America in congress assembled, that the president of the United State is hereby directed to take possession of the island of Cuba with the military and naval forces of the United States and hold the same until the people of Cuba can or ganize a government, deriving its pow ers from the consent of the governed, and arm and equip such military and na val forces as may be necessary to secure them against foreign invasion. as-nlnjiioii Letter. Washington, December 4th, 1S9 The Whit" House is about the out place in Washington one can go now w-thout meeting one or more setiatois aud representatives.

Memliers of the seuaU aud h. use foraign committees are said to have received some definite informa tion but to all the'rest it was stated in general terms that no immedite change wag contemplated in tne policy of the administration towards Cuba, and it is expected tha the president's message will treat the matter in about the same style The other members ofjthe cabin et have also had numerous cougrtsciou- ional callers, some ou business for their cons' ituents and some merely to pay a a fr'endly visit; but President Cleveland has nni Had much of h s time taken uo . &jyA ig QOt llkely to nAVe lue presiueui e imwngc s mi ij iu be sent to cougiess, and the usual pre cautions have leen taken to prevent it nremature publication. If it be fair to judge from the lack of curiosity as to the contents of that document ttus year those precautions were hardly necessary It will, of course, be printed as a matter of news when it goes to congress, but it is doubtful whether an advance copy of it could be sold to any paper in the country, not because of the belief that it will be any less interesting thtn Mr Cleveland's previous messages, but tie cause of the knowledge that the situa- tiou iu congress U su:h that no matter how wise the- recommendations of the message may be there is no possibility of their beiug carried out by legislation at the present session. There are all classes of men in most professions, but the increase of men who conduct their buainess upon the greeu goods mtn's theory that "a new sucker is boru every miuute, in the rauks ot the patent solicitors has aroused the hon orable patent lawyers to the nectsMty ot taking some action that will protect the inventors of the country and their own profession from the degradation and de moralization of the methods adopted to cajole money from the pockets of the in ventors without anv intention ot giving any equitaoie return mereior euuer present laws and rules the commissioner . 1 c J of patents can do nothing to protect either the honest patent lawyer or the inventor, except in cases of the most tUgrant nature, and then it must come under his personal notice alter an appli cation has been filed in the patent office; but it is thought that a paten bar to a proper extent uuder the jurisdiction of the commissioner of patents, could easi ly compel the lottery patent solicitors aud the delusive cicular patent solicitors to either reform their methods or gel out of the busiuess. In either case the inventors aud the honest patent lawyers would be gainers. Sjeaking of the probability that one or more senators may be asked to j:in McKinley's cabinet a veteran Kepuoli can senator said: Well, everybody miift judge for themselves, but the sen ator who has been in othee tor more than one term who is willing to enter the cabinet must either have lieen blind to what went on under his nose or im agine that he ps -esses the abilitv to make his experience different from that of other men who have tried the same thing. Many senators have leen per suaded into presidents' cabinets, but I j don't believe there was ever a single j one of them wLo did not regret it. Sen ator Lodge, of Mass., who has been mentioned as a cabinet possibility, says he would not leave the seuate for any po sition in McKinley's gift. Lodge may not have a level head on everything but on this subject he has There is noth ing in oflicial life, except the presidency, better thau a senatorship. There is alarm among the Republi- oans over a report that "Teddy" Roose velt is tiring of his New York job and wants to come back to ashiogton as assistant secretary of the navy under the McKinley administration. They don't want "Teddy" to come back to ashmgton, but he has a knack of get ting what he wants; hence their alarm. They know what a wonderful capacity "leddy has for stirring things up and keeping them stirred up. They think the extra session of congress and other McKinley inllictions will be troube enough without "Teddy." The news paper men are a uuit in desiring "Ted dy's" return to Washington as a mem of McKinley's administration: as an all around copy-maker-readable copy, too he beats the band, as the yellow kid says Senator Cull-mi. the gentleman who was a candidate for the liepublican presi dential nomination because of a fancied facial resemblance to Abraham Lincoln and who has been "mentioned" for the cabinet, has set up as a iiuaocinl oracle. He said: "The Republican party will settle the silver question within the next four years to the futisfaction of every body.' When asked to state how this wonderful settlemen t was to lc brought about the oracle replied: "Just what plan will be followed I cannot 6ay, but I feel sure it will be settled." Now isn't that convincing?, m 31 lues Rao Under Arms.

President Cleveland, he continues, finally dH-lares. without hesitation, that the jKiticuete of the United States ill waiting for Spain to end the contest. has a hunt : that the ohligat ions to tho seivereigmty of Spain will be super ceded by higher obligations and that considerations of humanity and a tie sire to see a rn li and fertile country, intimately related to the United Stat-s, saved freuti complete devastation, will subserve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to Cub.i and its inhabitants an oiiort unity to enjoy the bh-ssings of peace.
