Address, TmniJXE co„ Chicago, 111. MONDAY. DECEMBER 10, ISCO. niS.HIKAGE!QEM OF THE NA TIONAL DEBT. The reduction of the National debt daring the mouth of November only amonntsto 51,000,51 T. against $20,0X1,000 the preceding month. Largo payments of interest and small receipts from imports during the month accounts for most rf the difference be tween the sums paid in October and Novem- • ber on the debt. The duties received for tho past mouth have been but ten millions, while In October they were nearly twenty mil lions- The market* aro glutted with foreign goods, aud consequently importations have temporarily fallen off. An examination of the monthly statement shows tbat the greenback currency lias beau diminished $4,754,000, that the compound legal tenders have been re duced $1,125,000, that the 7-30 bonds have been reduced $21,051,005 by being converted into Five-Twenty gold interest bonds, and that the latter have been increased $32,705,- SOO. The gold in the treasury Is $35,108,816, of which there belongs to depositors $20,- <30,500, leaving $74,532,310 as belonging ab solutely to the Government. Tbc debt bear ing gold interest requires $77,800,000 to pay the interest thereon per year. The Govern ment has therefore on hand almost a year’s Interest of gold, while Us receipts of coin are morethiin double tbe gold interest on the debt. Such being tbe fact what beneficial object is attained by hoarding this vast sum of gold? Tie burden of Secretary Me- CnllochV report consisted of suggestions of projects to hasten tbc resumption of specie payments. A curtailment ot the redundant currency was thp main recommendation, and to that end he asked Congress to authorize him to retire eight or ten millions of green- • backs per month, which we trust they will not do. The December statement shows that there arc outstanding $1411,387,140 of co!iii>c.ijnd interest legal tenders. Why dees not the Secretary of tho Treas ury proceed to redeem and re tire this large mass of currency, which Is now drawing marly seven per cent of inurcet? 11-r ha> authority to do so.’ The withdrawal of those compounds will contract the currency very largely, aud at the same time contract the interest account of the Government at least ton millions of dollars per annum. The - Secretary can sell off enough uold between now and next May to redeem and cancel $105,000,030 of com pounds, and thereby stop nearly seven mil lions of interest, and Mill have abundance of gold iu the Sub-Treasury for all the wants of the Government. The Cdin and currency lying- Idle In the Treasury, if put to use, would earn or save, fVjO.I,OOO of Interest. The tax-payers arc therefore losing that amount by the policy pursued bjr their Secretary of the Treasury, in amas-sinp hundreds of millions of their money, instead oV applying it as fast os re ceived in payment of interestlind principal of the Nat‘oral debt. One month ago the coin and currency on hifnd amounted to sl3o,&i'>,oGo ; now it amounts to $133,354,037. We arc told that the debt.has been de creased $1,000,817 during the pist month, which, lu point of fact, Is noj true. The idle money in the Treasury has been increased - five millions, but the outstanding obligations of tho Gov ernment have beeu increased three and a tbiid millions of dollars. But that I* not all, nor the worst. Ou the Ist of November and Ut of December, the interest-bearing debt was composed as follows : November 1, }S-0. Dt-cezaber 1, jnw.. ■32.315, !M17,251 2,2W,703,431 Increase ofintm-tt-bcai Inc d*bt. 312,742,150 Now, this is a sort of patent financiering whlth the people can neither appreciate nor endorse, and we call tbe attention of mem bers of Congress to 11. It was In the power of the Secretary to have reduced the Inter est-bearing debt by an amount equal to that which he increased it, by tho simple process of celling Idle gold and buying up Com pounds and Seven-Thirty bonds, instead of Loardiug gold aud currency like a miser. The people want their sur plus taxes appropriated to liquidating the Debt which bears interest. They arc In no hurry to have the greenbacks, which oor*l nothing, withdrawn from circula tion to make room for lour hundred millions more of debt drawing interest. And if Mr. Jehnson’s satellite hi the Treasury building persists In disregarding the- wishes Of the people, ft Is the duty of Congress to give him peremptory orders In the premises. Till-: rsitmi.MMi EABCB, The tvnuion exvrcbc of the pardoning power by the President is eliciting from all parts of the country the strongest expres sions of indignation, and the recent declara tion in npi-n donate, that abandoned women were trafficking in pardons, is but a confir mation of the Impression which prevails in the country that the clemency of tbs nation is- bartered for money. The Constitution gives to the President the |>owcr of pardon for all offences against the United States, ex cept in cases of impeachment. With this single exception, Lh power em braces oil other crimes, and bis exercise of that power, while It cannot be renewed ro far a* it refers to the person par* doned, i> cnly open to legal, criticism when It forms the subject of impeachment for oilicial misconduct. The President may be imjcaciud for “treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.” Impeach ment i- rot a means ot bringing an olTcndcr to punishment; It is merely an inquire as to whether, being guilty of n;ch crime or mis demeanor, he should be permitted to occupy a place of trust uuder the Government. It U not necessary tint a man sbUI be conviclcd of treason in a law court, to justify his ImjK-acaintnt and de position for that ollbnce. Ho can he convicted of treason upon an impeachment and be deposed Tom office, and that, too, upon evidence which would not warrant his c nvlink-n before a court ami jury. He may be convicted and deposed upon impeachment for bribery ; aud that may Include the be stowal of cilice, of commissions in the-army and navy, or of pardons for crime, where thd Presid- nt has accepted a pecuniary or other personal o-nsideratb n. It does not require even thai he should be therociplcnt, directly or induce!ly, of the consideration- If he do any n.-t, knowing that a relative, friend or acquaintance is to be j«ld therelor, and U moved to do the act because of such resulting gain, the transaction is a corrupt oae, and because of its cor uption, whether it be technically a crime or not, his gallt npoa'an impeachment would be manifcot, and his conviction unavoidable. If the President has granted pardons upon the application of any person, male or female, knowing that Euch person was to be paid for procuring the tame, and was moved to giant the pardon through his or her agency, that he or Bhe might get the fee, then upon impeachment, his corrupt conduct would be established jeet as overwhelmingly as if he bad taken tbe fee in perron. Upon Impeachment, an officer can be convicted and deposed for any conduct unbecoming an officer, whether the same would be technically a crime In any other mede of Inal or not. Judges have been impeached and deposed for drunken ' ness—an offence not cognisable under any. criminal law. But tbe crime of misdemeanor constated of his being unfit to discharge fals duties because of bis Intoxication. The great offence, to remedy which the authority • of impeachment was designed, was the, corrupt use of official power. Treason in an official is In fact a higher crime than when committed by a person not In office. Bribery Is a'crime poisoning tbe very waters of official honesty. The sale of office, or the granting of pardons for znoney, or any other corrupt purpose, is bribery in an aggravated form. If the Fred dent grants a pardon or makes an appoint ment upon any condition in which he or any other person is to be benefited thereby; if he grants a pardon requiring of tbe pardohed or any other person a personal or political support, or a support of a particular -candidate for office, or of a particular measure of legislation, or an opposition thereto, while tbe pardon Itself may not be vitiated by the consideration required, the official corruption of the act is as flagrant as If he had demanded aud received a consider ation is money. Wc suggest that the remedy for Andrew Johnson’s abuse of the pardoning power Is notln questionable measures for the limita tion or restriction of a power, which by the Constitution Is unlim- Ued, save In the particular cases excepted, but In the power which the Constitution gives of impeaching and deposing every of ficer guilty of official corruption. The President’s power Is plain, direct and am ple ; hut the President is responsible for any corrupt nsc of that power, and upon proof of it can be tl rust a proceeding almost summary iu its character. Congress may also provide, if ihc laws now cilrting do not cover the ease, lor the ar» rest, trial and punishment of all persons convicted of being in any way as principal or agent concerned In procuring pardons from the Executive by purchase or any otCcr corrupt means. With the power In their own hands of dismissing the corrupt official, and ihc power of providing legal punishment for ill accomplices Insnch corrupt practices,Con gress Certainly can better reach and arrest .the evil, than byjrultleas efforts to limit a P° wer ♦bich by the Constitution is not Um ttable by any legislation. THE 

FENIAN BUSINESS, ITic British .Government, upon the escape of James Stephens, went through the for mality of offering a reward of £I,OOO for his capture, and at the same time refused to In vestigate the circumstances of escape, or even to punish the officers through whose want of proper vigilance that escape was only possible. There can hardly be any question In the mind of any calm observer of Fcnlanlsm, that Stephens has been playing the part of a fool, or that be Is in point of fact acting in behalf of the British Gov ernment, and agalnsi those of his country men who repose confidence In him. e do not wish to be understood as In any way impeaching the justice of the Fenian cause when we say that .we do not expect the slightest success to any movement made under the auspices of Stephens, or that any movement calculated to be successful will evj cr be undertaken by him. The Irish people are very enthusiastic In all things relating to the emancipation of their country, and their own patriotism mikes- them most credulous. They have been deceived lime after time, and always by their own countrymen. The purest of their patriots have been sold to death or bondage, and the honest ones have been fleeced of their money and betrayed Into the hands of the British, and always by men who won their confidence by blatant professions of superior zeah Stephens has been the head of the Fenian organization for years. During that time money has been flowing to him from aUmarta of the world. Nothing, however, waroonc, until the Order in America became clamorous, when the British suddenly discovered Stephens, where he had been residing for years, arrested him with his principal associates, including hU brother-in-law; the parties were all lodged In prison; all were tried and convicted ex tiept Stephens, .who escaped under circum stances that' flrongly indicate offi cial connivance. His brother-in-law was tried, convicted, and then pardoned, - and tbeothers, of whose honesty there is no doubt, were transported for terms varying from ten to twenty years. Tbc American about this time broke up tbclr organization, or made a new one, substituting Roberts for Stephens immediately came to this country to take possession of all the funds of the Or 'der and to collect more. He utterly opposed tbc invasion of Canada, and it is supposed tbc British authorities had the full benefit of whatever information be had In his pos session. He remained In this country as long as be could beg or borrow a dollar, promising to bave a fight in Ireland before New*Ycar’s day. He Jell a represent ative behind him to pick up such dollars os might be contributed upon the strength of fabulous reports, ami as soon as that Is over, there will, in be tbe A qgd of p Stephens’ Revolution in Ireland. There may be an onlbreak;us there have been outbreaks before; there mav l e a" marshalling of the people by tens of thoasands, as - can be bad at any lime ; there may be a few conflicts between the people and the constabulary uml soldiers, In which for a time the people will be successful, but then will come the collapse; some hundreds of honest men will be arrested, convicted of treason, be bung or transported, and the chains of Ire land be made more galling than ever. Vic think that a candid reviewer of the whole agency of Stephens, most concede Jliat the weight of testimony is to the. cflcct that that * individual has been engaged in destroying the Fenian organiza tion, apd placing Us leaders and Its men in the bands of the British the money of the order for its own destruction, nod for the corruption of Its chosen leaders, j Should Stephens be successful in this mat* ter—snccesrful in betraying his countrymen into the hands of the English Government, while he will take high rank ip the lung list of those Irishmen who have proved false to their own country, ho will nevertheless strike the cause of Irish frevdom a more deadly blow than it has received for a century. THE URUUU S\ STEW. Ulie report of the Postmaster General ■states that “there are now in operation 7CC money order offices lu tbe United Stales— being 347 more than at the date of tbe last annual report, and measures have been taken to add slxty-ecvcn more offices iu the Pacific States and Territories.” The number of-or ders issued during tho year waa 243,003, of tbe valne of $3,977,259. The system was first Introduced November 1,1804, and the*busi ness cf the past year was three times as great as that of ihe preceding year. The average amount of each order issued daring the year was $10.33, And during the past year only five eases of loss through fraud have oc curred. The money system is growing rapidly Into public favor, ami only needs two things to increase its usefulness filly.fold, viz; cheaper rates and morcofficcs. It is perfectly absurd to suppose that 833 money offices arc sufficient for the wants of the people of the whole United States. There arc 24.CKX) thousand post offices in operation In the United States, with 15,(X» more lo reopen In the South. Consequently there Is bat one tnoney-ordcr office to every /Afrfypost cffices lu operation. The Post master General should establish a money order office at each county scat throughout the Union, whow population exceed* SX) inhabilaoU. There is a peculiar uiecc*- sity for having a money-order office at each county scat. Those places are the capital* of their respective comities, where all the official and much or most of the com mercial business is transacted. Every house holder has frequent bnslneet at tbe county' scat, either to pay hi* taxes, attend the court*, or Board* of' Supervisors, record deeds, pay or loan money, buy good* or aeil produce, or mail or receive letters and papers. The range of post office delivery nearly always extend* several mile* round about a-county Beat. By making the po*. office at the couuty scat a monoy-orde. - office the people of the whole county, will os a general thin* be accommodated. The system should also be extended to all the other large towns in a county ~t>»*ni exceeding say 1,000 Inhabitants, and more (Specially It they are located on tbe Hu? of a railroad, lake, or navigable river. There should be net less than 3.033 moon- order offices In the United State*, or four tlm.s as many os arc now established. Nothing bat lack of intelligent enterprise on the part of the Post Office Department prevents such an extension as the public require. The Post master General has been so much engaged in swinging around the circle, and cutting off the beads of his subordinates who adhered lo the principles of the Republican party and tilling their places with Copperheads and Conservatives of easy political virtue, that he has not had time, lo attend totholesitl mate duties of bis office,,or to devote much thought to the interests of the public. The law should bo amended so at to pro vide cheaper and more equitable rates. The present fee established by law on an order of *s2o, Is ten cents, and on an order exceeding SSO and under 840, Is twenty-five cents. That is, an order for S2O is ten-cents, and for s2l it U twenty-five cents, *By this of charges the first {2O costs ten cents, but tbe next dollar costs fifteen cents; and it Is actually cheaper by fire cents to purchase two S2O orders than one 840. The law should be amended to correct this stupid blunder of its framers. And we would pro pose the following scale of charges In lien of those now established: All orders under 810, five cents. On all orders over 810 and nndcr 850, o*e.kalf per cent. Tbns an order for sl2 would cost’ six cents; forßl6, eight cents; for 820, ten cents; for 80-% eighteen cents—giving the Government the fraction of a cent —and for 840, $45 and 850, twenty, twenty three and twenty-five cents. Everybody would understand exactly what any order would cost by the half per cent scale, and every order exactly in proportion to Its amount. There would be no trouble in making change, because everybody has either postal or ntckcl currency. After the number of order offices have been sufficient ly multiplied,. and tho system comes into general nsr. the rates may be reduced, first to a third per cent on sums over fifteen dol lars ; and then to a fourth per cent on smns over twenty dollars, still retaining five cents as the minimum rate for an order. We call the attention of the House Postal Commit tee to the improvements here suggested, ■which ought io be made in tbe existing law, and hope they will receive favorable consid eration. The present registration system Is a humbug and a failure, and should be re pealed, as it serves only to show dishonest clerks which letters contain money for them to steal. rev There is an association of office bold ers and tide waiters In Washington calling themselves the “ Conservative Army and Navy Club.” They arc a class of needy, seedy, greedy persons who have principles for sale tothe highest bidders for greenbacks or offices. They arc of the genus Mtcawbcr, always waiting for something to taro up. During the last of November the mem bers ofthift Mlcawber Club heard that John son intended to advocate impartial suffrage in bis message to Congress. Thereupon they hastened to assemble and pass a string of resolutions strongly endorsing ltn partial suffrage, .hoping thereby to please the Radicals, and at the same time “ support" the President. A few day*} afterwards the message ap. pcared, and to their consternation, contained uolaword in favor of impartial suffrage, and not a word in favor of conferring any po litical rights on the people of color; but on the contrary, it reaffirmed all the old plati tudes heard a hundred times while swinging around the clroic, about the rights of white washed rebels to Instant participation Id the Government, and a monopoly of political rights and privileges 1b the South. Tho poor aplrlfleM “supcs” Immediately hastened to their club room, and repealed their Impartial suffrage platform, and re solved In favorof “my policy” as theqnlntes , sence of statesmanship and patriotism.’ There is a specimen of manhood for you. BEXZABIIiirATION 

OPTHE SOUTH. Secretary McCulloch recommends fire measures, the adoption of which, he thinks, will speedily bring abont specie payments. Thedilth Is, “The rehabilitation of the Sooth em States,* 1 and ho then proceeds to argue in favorof Johnson’s policy of Instant and unconditional admission of the* bogas gov ernments of to a participation In the Government, on cqnal terms with the 6ona fida loyal States. The elections appear to have langbt him nothing. Ho don’t seem to be aware tbat this whole scheme, and its author, were unconditionally repudiated by the people at the ballot-box. But he utterly tails to show ‘Jb what respect the admission of the rebels to Congress will pro ducc a resumption of specie payments. tVhat industrial encouragement would the South receive by haying one half of Us pop ulation represented in Congress, and the other half misrepresented? Can the partial feUurt of the cotton crop, with the conse quent pecuniar; loss to tpde, bo charged on Congress? What legislation would the “South” obtain if her rebel rep resentatives were admitted that would pro mote her industrial resources ? A strong effort, we admit, would be made to repeal the tax on cotton. But that impost wUI be removed Just as soon os the finan cial wants or* the Government will permit of It. Nobody is discouraging the “South” from, developing Its industrial resources. Con gress his not Interfered with tho .labors of the people of the South, except to prevent tbc rebels from cheating and swindling the freedmen out of thelfwages. Every Radica wonts the whole people of the South, white and . black, to go ahead and make money. But if the ec-rebels deslpqthe pecuniary help of Nwthcrn capitalists, they most cease per secuting' and ostracising those from the North who settle among them. They must not -bite the hand that assists them. They must exhibit a mare law-abiding and friendly splritjtbey must quit insulting and reviling Northern citizens; they mnst respect free speech, free press and in dependent action. And they bad better stop sbarliug and whining over their “lost cause,” and venting their chagrin on tho Yankees who como among them. And they had bet ter accept with alacrity, such terms of recon struction as Congress, In behalf of their con-' querors, shall graciously vouchsafe to them for they may travel farther and fine worse. If Secretary McCulloch had’ talked to the refractory rebels something alter tbe foregoing manner he would bave done more towards the rehabilitation of the “South” and the resumption of specie payments a thouiand times, than he did by nattering their folly and encouraging their contumacy. And if he were not a Bourbon, or a servile satellite of “ A. J.,” destitute of •prosrrcs slve Ideas and philosoplcal opinions, he wouiJ bave advised them to the tiina ? ir>n,” and consent to reconstruction cn the !»asla of equal political and civil rights to all citizens. But het is no states man a-J many bcgifl tothink nota very pro found financier. TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES. We are glad to sec that tho papers of New York arc beginning seriously to discuss the subject of enlarging the Erie Cana', and con structing a ship canal from the Hudson River to Lake Champlain. It Is at last conceded that the present railroadUncaare insufficient to convey the produce of fho swiftly crow ing West to market.* It has been found that the cost of railroad* transportation J& so great for long distances os to Injure the mar ket of the remote producer, and that water routes must mainly be depended on in the future, to prevent ihe people of the West from being eaten ou» of house and homs *>y the cost of railway transportation. Genei al Unnks.ln discussing this subjojt lately, romrrked that, “we have tried rail roads, and found thenrutter failures, so far as being available means of transportation for the great bulk of our produce and com merce.” He declared himself in favor of ship canals, and his sentiments are quite gen erally endorsed. Among such projects now being discussed, are a ship canal around the Niagara Falls, a steamboat canal from the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan, and an other from Lake Champlain to the Hutlsoa River, Surveys of tho first mentioned, en terprise demonstrate its entire feasibility. * The New York Posi % in an article discussing this subject, says: • Lari winter our state Legislature directed a f urvcy for the proposed ship canal from tnc Uad son hive: to Lake Chimultlu.

The action of the Senate In deposing Doo little, Cowan, Dixon, and Norton from tbl important places they held on committees, and giving them hack among the perheads, is right and proper In every point of new. Those Individuals, elected by Re publican Legislatures, in the belief that they were honorable and reliable members of the great Republican party, have seen proper to turn traitors lo thtir party and desert to the enemy. Having thus absconded from the - Republicans and taken refuge in the ranks of the Coppcrjofanson-rebel parl», they were no longer entitled to .hold tbe places on the committees assigned to them when they were acting with tbe Republican party. They stand before the country as recreants, impeached and repudiated by their cuts, and it is fitting and proper tbns to brand them as deserters and expunge their names from tbe Republican rolls. If these men had a particle of honorable man hood,' or a spark of shame in their composi tion, they would never show tbclr heads again In the Senate house, but would resign their offices into the hand* of the people whom they misrepresent and betray. They have no moral right to retain the Senator-' ships after they cease to carry oat the will of their constituents. They have in effect,-usurpers of office. They are no longer repirtenlctivc* of the people of the' State* they come from. They represent Johnson and the rebels, but not the loyalj freemen of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Pennsyl vania and Connecticut. If they were any-, thing bnt brassy, unprincipled politicians, with sensibilities as obtuse as the hide of a rhinoceros,'they, would do two things, in etantly resign, and then migrate to the South never again to be seen-north of Mason and Dixon's line, where they are unworthy to "dwell, or io breath its pure air. Cowan's term of office expires twelve weeks hence, when he will finish his politi cal career. But the terms of Doolittle and Dixon have unfortunately something more than two years to no. Ob, speed the wings of time! Couldn’t be Hired. -During the late canvass in Maryland, says an exchange, the Copperheads In one of the to*ns projected a grand procession, one • feature of which was to be a negro riding on a bureau. The piece of ftxrnitnrc was easily purchased, bot the man was not to be hired, although \the most needy and the most worthless col ored men In the neighborhood were applied to. Not a negro could be found who would be teen in a Copperhead ■procession, and on^. of the Copperheads bad to personate a black man by the aid of bnrnt cork. Those who think the negroes such fools that they would vote to please those who design to oppress and degrade them, may take a lesson from this Incident. EUEOPE. Letter from Paris.

' I Correspondence of thu Chicago Tribune.] . • Pams, November 15,1666. 1 think I made a grand discovery yesterday —one relating to a matter which boa for many yean troubled the minds of physicians and Mavant in this, the most pleasure-loving’ city Id tho world. The discovery relates to suicide, and the caustj whlclA induces ooc Frenchman to make a jump from the Pout Ncuf into the Seine; another to descend from the July Column without using the stairs; another to make a flying trip from a five or six story win dow to the pavement; and another, or, perhape, two, (supposing them to be lovers,) to smother himself or themselves with char coal vapor.. My discovery may not receive the credit which it is really cntUled to, but Hook upon It in an exceedingly favorable light, and have serious thoughts of getting it • patented. I lay the whole blame on the Bourse, and believe 1 can make out a first rate case, for at noon yesterday, when I took my sent In the gallery, the few Frenchmen who were on the chain floor acted la a per fectly rational manner; whlld at one o’clock they and the later comers were capering around in all manner of grotesque attitudes and yelling out In such a way as to scare nearly every foreigner In the gallery. One of onrfiarty, who La'S never been in a lunatic asylum, said to me, “Well, they are a funnv set of fellows !’* And another, who spent several years of his life in the South west, before the war, remarked, “If they Were Arkansas or Texas folks, they wouldn’t abuse each other that way without some body being carried out.” In the meantime the row increased, and by half-past one it had reached the point which was once des cribed by Isiab Rynders, after tbe sudden breaking up of a Aofl Shell Convention, as “ almighty lively?’ Not understanding much of the French language, the American party In the gallery could not account fur the riot, until, after the adjournment, they were informed by an attache of Consol Nicolay’s office that it had •probably been caused bytbe rise of one tilth of a sou in French rentes; “ and as the rise couldn’t have been more than that,” said the attache, “ the meeting wOs undoubt edly a very quiet one, because the Bourse never gets excited unless the rise or fall amounts to at least two centimes.” Why,” said one of ffite party, -in great sur prise. “I never heard socb an infernal row 'An all my life, and if yon call to-day’s meeting a quiet one, I can’t say that I care about attending ooc that’s disorder ly?” ‘‘Oh, they never get disorderly,” re plied the attache, “as Americans understand the term; they certainly make a great deal of noise when the ‘Bourse is excited.’ bat they don’t harm anybody, and although you may have supposed some of them were shaking their usu In others’ faces for the fturnose of getting up a fight, they ouly did so to show that they were earnest In making their Lids.” ® W hen our psrty passed out of tbe Bourse, and made our way to the Maison Doree, tbe legitimate connection between the scene at the J'-onree and suicide occurred to me; and the next lime I hear that any dally operator at the Bourse has made a leap from the Arc de Triomphe, or that his body has been fished out or tbe Seim.- and is on exhi bition at the Morgue, I shall pass the mat ter by being one of the inevitable results of cause aud effect. Such is my discovery- You are welcome to it, for, upon second thought, I havy con eluded not to apply for a patent. - — TUE EXPOSITION. . The Exhibition building, in the Champ do Mate, is said to be in a satisfactory state ; but u vast amount of labor is still to be done upon it, as well as upon the surrounding grounds, which, although at present covered with different kinds oi dthrls, ere expected by opening day to be os beautiful as French landscape gardeners can make them. Tbe huildiug Is on the opposite side of the Seine from the Tuillcries, directly In front ol the bridgd of Jena, and probably two or two aud a half miles from the Grand Hotel. It will cover about forty -debt acres, and Lj Intended to be a capital specimen of French skill aud Industry. The grounds will comprise nearly eeventv;slx acres, and a liberal part of the sr.mc will.

Paris. An Immense number of Americans are ex pected ggxt spring, and hotel and restaurant keepers anticipate rich pickings. And per haps a few words of advice to such of your readers as intend to come, may not be out of place iu this connection; If tJl ® puny is a ilngio tele, and has no disposition to be unnecessarily fleeced, he had better, upon his arrival, give his banker an order to find him. a sleeping room in a convenient part of the city, say within three or Jour squares of the Hotel du Louvie, or of the Grand Hotel, or of the lower end of the Boulevard dcs Ilalleus. At this time furnished rooms can bo obtained In these lo calities at low rates—some of them, of small ilze, being procurable for twelve francs a mouth. Including attendance. It is all folly for a man to put up at either one of the big hotels, at a cost lor room of from five to forty francs a day, and to dine at the laW< d hot , e tet three or four limes the price that would be charged Idm for a good meal at a respectable restaurant. But It’s not the thing, exactly, to patronize the restaurants on the Boulevards, for they arc gotton up In grand t-tyle, and some of them are said to pay 200,000 francs a year rent; consequently their charges are high, and one doesn't get auy better dinner for eight or ten francs at the Restaurant Foy or Sfalson Doree than he could get at Kinsley’s in your city for half the mouey. A short distance, however, from either of the Boulevards, In any given di rection, are . numerous rtalauranta, that set very good tables at ; reasonable prices—say fifteen, to twenty, cents lor breakfast, and twenty-five ccnti t*> half a dollar for dinner. A dinner In almost any of the»e places for a quarter of a dollar consists of a dirb of soup, half a plot of tnodeia'ely good claret, two plotcsofmeat i one plate of vegetables, and about half u pound of first-rate bread. Dessert and coffee- 1 would cost ten cents extra. 1 was in Paris nearly six weeks befjre learned how to ge*. a cheap breakfast or din ner, but was finally posted by a good Samar itan in the shape of a New Yorker,, who, «ns irank enough to sav to me, one! day, upon learning that I ba'djust paldawuvj •even francs and a half fora dinner at the Troh* Krone, that I wasa bigger fool than he" hud given me credit for being. He further ?ald that ftU dli.n-r? were very fair, and that, ihcy usually cv*t biro a franc each, although occasionally he was cxlravigant enough to' i-3T a nanc and a half. At his request I dined with him next dav,at a small bat neatly kept restaurant, in the Faubourg Montmartre, and the price for both dln ncra was three francs and twcnty*flve { tlxty.fi re cents. There was ns much CH the table as we felt like rating and tho cooking was d«,nc to a turn. Since then I Lave eaten at ibe fame place, at an avenge dally expense el about fosty-five cents, exclusive of ten cents for the inevitable cap of black coffee and cognac tn the early morning—a bever age which every Parisian and nearly every sojourner In Purls appeal to consider the next thing to the andUeov en d elixir of life.

Argument Before Jndso Fisher CponDo. mnrrer to the Indictment*' Wasnnroroif, Dec-mberft. In the case of Conover, upon argument of die demurrer to the Indictment, the prisoner was brought io'o eonrtbefore Judge Fisher this morn ing. The accused is quite a One looking mao, ap caiently twenty-six or twenty-eight y.ara old, six u-cl high, oval tace. blue eyes and dark hair. Mr. Gooding, tor the prisoner, after bnefly recltmr it history of the case, proceeded to argue the de murrer to the indictment filed yesterday, taking the following grounds: First. The Issue on which ibe evidence ot defendant was given was an immaterial issue- The so-called depositions wc:e rut depositions, and were not affidavits, even the Judge Advocate, General Dolt, having no antho-liy to administer an oath. If false they would not have eop.oiteJ the cha-ge of perjury, and, therefore, anything said as to their truth or falsity would not support the charge. The said depositions were never sworn to, and could m.t have been evidence. The defeh"anl was sworn to .testify os to the truth or falsity of said depositions, and as to the truth or falsity of Here's statement, which was altogether about said depositions, all of which was immaterial to Ihe Inquiry authorised lobs made. Second. Ad mitting said depositions were Draper and legiti mate evidence, u>e Court does not expressly state that they were admlfcd ae evidence in toe In quiry pending, which omisrion cannot be sap plied in Lhc;fndlamcnL Third. The first and roc ono assignments of perjury are repngnant,the first alleging that the defendant denied Haro’s s’ate ment, and the second that be denies it In the main. Fourth. As to the second assignment, the defendant says in substance that a pait of Hare's Matemcnt is irne, and a part not true. The in dictment should a :t out the part about which the f Ue statement la made for proper certainty. Both the first and second questions arc too general to support the charge of perjury. Fifth. That the defendant has reason to donot, or docs doubt, is immaterial as an abstract question. The fact that the answer forestalls further inquiry Into ibe tacts does not make It oerjory. His doubts and reasons to doubt arc matte™ of personal opinion, cot even professional opinion, which alone Is admissable as evidence, and in which perjury can seldom 1 ever be sustained. Sixth. The said depositions or at least contents, should be set out In the indictment for proper certainty, ibe defendant may desire and be able to prove the truthfulness of Ufe said deposi tions, acd that be had no reason to doubt and did not doubt their truthfulness. The history recited by Mr. Gooding is to the effort I bat, after the trial of the conspirators. Judge Holt lock certain affidavits tending to im nhcale JtfL DavU in the conspiracy. Acfoug others. Joseph A. Hoare and Joseph A. Snivel, which arr alleged to hate been prepared by the accused; that one of the standing committees of the Bouse of . Hepresentatlvea, the. Ju diciary. was charged to Inquire it fo the alleged connection ; that Hare and Snivel appeared before said committee and testified (bat the affidavit made by them were false, and Conover alfe appeared before the com mittee and made oath that the facts in those affi davit* were true. In addltiou to (he grounds taken in tho above, Mr. Gooding Con tended that the reanoostbtaty of Judge Holt, who had no anihonty to administer an oalb, find the so-called depositions, amounted to nothing but ordinary conversations, quoting from 'he first of u Hawkins’ Pleas of the Crot«,'’.pagc, Ml. If Holt could administer an oath, Conover should he further Indicted tor sub ornation to perjury. He read from ** Bussell on SsJPjI.V* I, £P aM ff arh Ml, to show that an affidavit taken before a magistrate to bo used be fore a'ComroltUe of toe House of Representa tives, although false. St did not soppotl the allegation of perjury. Instead aside the depositions, and asking Hoare What be koewaljont the facts, they asked whether what wns set forth iu the alleged affidavi' wastrnc. Mr. Gooding proceeded o read from the In diciment, noticing (be anomaly of a witness bein'* eallct to testify to the truth of bis own depoiitloo.« lie took the ground that the ques t-ona by the Committee were too general. The Committee askfed Conover for an opinion which they should have made op tbere- "^ e Indictment la directive In uat, al though the depositions were treccived In crldtxcc. It ii nqt stated that they „ r-ocivca «, u , b |, , u ,r. Gooding also read the law auhorWug the chsirman or the commltieea In Congress to ad minu-tm oaths, and rawed (be objection thittho law was defective inasmuch as It did not declare false swearing btfoie a committee to bo a crime. Ihe District Attorney followed on the other side, and «iid that for the sake of argument, admitting that Jude#Holt did not have authority lo administer an oath, yet he did contend that the accused made before the committee false state ment s wilfully and maliciously. He read from Brightly the case under which the Indictment is found, which provides that the Speaker of the lionse. rhalnnaiLor Committees may admloUtcr oaths, and any person, swearing falsely shall be deemed guilty of perjury. Ho first proceeded to a.scnss me meaning of too wort! perjury, and con tended that was a proceeding before a judicial tri as not that committee refected to a ju dicial tnbnnal f . J Judge Fisher said he would like to hear the question as lo whether tho House of Representa tives had authority to order the said In w; whdther it was not an invjslon of the dudictary Department by one House of Congress, and contrary to the distribution of powers by the Constitution. Ue remarked that the question was Included in the point of Mr. Gooding as to the statute, and it was on the disposition of which the whole case would turn. The District Attorney remarked that he would like to have lime to investigate the question, and (be argument was continued.! FROM MEXICO.

TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. Border of-a Child by In mother—The Wretehwi Woman Attempts to Com* mlt Suicide* From the Wheeling Jntrfligeneer we learn the following particulars of a most horrible and desperate murder and attempted suicide which occurred ou Wednesday morning hut. the Packer Uolel In that city: * A woman, who (rives her name os Minnie N agent, arrived there on Tuesday morning last ou the Parkersburg boat, aud tooklodg mgs. She bad with her a little girl about yircc years old. There was nothing especial* ly unusual about her appearance, or that created the least suspicion os to the horrible musion on which she had come. After she had been assigned to a room, very litlle'was seen of "her by the inmates of the Übusc. bhc ate her breakfast and also her dinner, having the child with her at both meals, she did not come down to supper,, nor to breakfast the next (yesterday) morning. The landlady, noticin*; her absence, sent up to her room to ecc if anything was wrong, aud the chamber maid returned saying that the woman was asleep. Dinner passed off, and svlU the ’ woman did not come down. Thinking soch long fasting a very unusual occurrtpce, the landlady went up to the room a second lime with her chambermaid, and, knocking at the door, the woman came and opened it. The situation of affairs wus soon made known Shu pointed those at the door to her little girl lying dptd in the bed, and at once coo lessed that she had murdered it on the pro-y Tlous evening, since which lime she had been under the influence of opium, taken with .the expectation of killing herself. Indeed, the evidences of a'l the said were conclusive enough. She had been vomiting, and was at the lime in a state r of delirium from the ef* feels of the drug. Her child was lying in its blood-staLcd night clothes In the bed from which she hao just arisen, with three mortal dagger slabs through its left breastand side. The sight was horrible enough, and was made doubly so by the situation of the woman. wna with opium she was able to tell the history of the cir cumstance. She related that her maiden name was Arbor: that Jier parents lived at Wdliamstown, In Wood County, in West Virginia, opposite Marietta; that lour years ago she bad married a man named Nugent, against their consent, running away with him'and that two months after the birth of the little girl he had dcserlctHier, and had never that her mother had refused to become reconciled to her, and lm«l never forgiven her marriage, but had made her home so intolerable that she could not live there; and had pobonetTthe'tolnds of ail her .other relatives against her to such an extent that she bad no place on earth tor call a home, and was lorccd to go out in the world and seek a subsistence. She had gone out, and had found teat there was no place fur her; nothing that she could do, and' she could not bcarto beg her way irom place to place. Kcuderccf thus desperate by brooding over her hopeless prospects, and anxious not lo leave her little daughter to a la«c worse, perhaps, than death, she calmly resolved to end both their lives, and after making up her mind to.this effect, came to Wheeling to carry out her resolve. She purchased a small dagger ard also several papers of powdered oi ium, and seems to have made minute prep arations for death, as the documents pub lished below teem to indicate. She said that for several hours after arriving, she could not bear to kill her child, and yet she fell that she must do it. She 'waited until it 1-11 asleep, and then pulling oa its night clothes and placing It In bed. bent over It, and kissed it several time* before planting the dagger In its heart, as she Anally did. The child she said, made no crj-, only moaned, and with scarcely a struggle, bled to death. She bad slabbed it three times, twice in the left lung and once In the heart. She says lint be fore she took its life she knelt down and prayed over it, and also repeated her praver after she had inflicted the wounds, and that she had kUsed away its last expiring breath.. After the perpetration o» this horriolc and unnatural deed, she took the opium with which she proposed to take her own life, and Uicu lay down beside her dead child to die. From some cause, either from an overdose of the opium, or else from an insufficient amount of it, she failed to accomplish her in tentions of suicide, she bad vomited a , weat deal, and seemed to have thrown up most of the poison. Several powders, with directions In a female handwriting, were found among her tttects, as were also a number of letters. She !s a young woman, aged only about twenty-one, rather Illiterate and evidently unbalanced in her mental and moral organi zation. The following letters serve these characteristics.

General Banks of Massachusetts, oat of bis own State, is not known to tame. In thetdaya of the American civil war be*was beud of for a momenfras the cause oi'igno • mlnloua failure and disgrace to the Federal arms ; and he subsequently attracted sumo attention by bis absurd conduct In cotmectibn with the Paris Exhibit! .-a. lie now comes to the surface again, and we And him bringing a bill before Congress to annex British North America to the Uqited States. The propo sal, however, that the4Jnlted States should purchase British NortlT America did not oriclnattfln the brain of Banks. The General merely pave the coinage currency. The author Is a Mr. James W. Taylor, special agent of the Treasury Department in Minne sota. who has. It must be admitted, ap proached the subject in the spirit of a statesman. Nor is it pat forth with the least unfriendly feeling to this country, for “ the overture” is avowedly to be made “upon* the tallest consultation with the Govern ment of Great Britain.” But nevertheless we have a scheme perfected.* The lands un conceded, the harbors, the light-houses, the canals, the river and lake impovements,all the property of the Canadian and other Governments, with their. lien on railways, are to be given 1 over to the United States Government, who will thereupon assume the debts of the I Province. The transfer has only to be made for the territorial division* are already tabllshed. Even the number of members to be sent to Washington is determined, and, with two slight exceptions. cbnsent of the population of British America and the concurrence of the Imperial Government, there is nothing to Impede the measure. But as there may be tome difficulty in ob taining these conditions,the schemes hare been temporarily allowed to drop, to be re vived, doubtless from time to time, when the Massachusetts manufactures desire to extend their msrkcts, and think they have a cnance of doing so. We cannot have a better proof of the value attached by the United States to British America, that they urge the general Govern ment to assume the Provincial debts, and to annex the terrltorv. Mr. Tavlor possessed atatemansbip enough to provide for an im provement to which the Canadian Govern ment have shown most reprehensible indif ference—the enlargement of the Conaduo c*nals. Mr. Taylor proposed to appropri ate fifty millions of dollars “to aid the navi cation of the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, that vessels of 1,500 tons burden shill from the Gulf ol St. Lawrence to Lakes Michigan and Superior.” Although ignored and neglected by the Canadian Government, the scheme la quite feasible. At present the produce of the West passes by the ere it lakes, to the foot of Lake Eric, wtere It has an entrance at Buffalo ,which Is the point of entry of the rente at Lake Eric.JOn the other band, it takes the Welland Canal on the Canadian side to LakcOntario—to Oswego passing by the canal of that name to the main Erie Canal. The latter connects Lake Eric with Albany,—the waters of the Hud son. Such is the pressure of the trade that a vessel is eleven and twelve days passing from Lake Erie to the Hudson. New York is thus the one seaport of the West, but it would cease to be so to a great extent if the Canadian canals were deepened, and the navigation improved, as Mr. Taylor, who is cstem man, had the sagacityto see. No little of the trade would then be transferred to Boston, which, indeed, might become the depot of the West, f But the greatest benefit resulting from this would accrue to Canada. If the canals were deepened so that a sea-going vessel could pass, without breaking bulk m its car go, to the Far Went, the'maritime highway -would be through that Province. For ft may be said that the Eric Canal can be im proved only to a very limited degree, owin'*- I to the difilculty of obtaining water, which is 1 now admitted to be Barely sofiicient. It U true that the work would cost some millions oPdollars, and that the shallow waters of Lakes St. Louis and St. Francis would re quire a large expenditure to dredge them: further, the necessity of keeping the naviga tion oppn while the enlargement was In pro gress would odd greatlv to Its expense. But no one has doubted the feasibility of the echemb, or, at all events, has put his objec tions In such a form that they can bo exam ined and answered. On the otner band, the condition of improving the‘navigation has been examined both by American and Can adian writers of eminence, at length, and with ability, to the extent that the informa tion at the disposal of the writers would ad mit. It Is plain that the American authori ties are conversant with the value of the St. Lawrence as a highway, and General Banks may be considered to represent the public opinion of his State when he proposes ■ hat it shall be developed. Here lies the value of his extraordinary proposition to the English statesman. Even Its ridiculous side disappears when £ la so considered. The well-wisher of Canada ought, therefore, to be thankful. But to judge by the tone of ndlgnallon,whicb,without exception,cbarac erizes Canadian journalism, British America Is not particularly grateful to the Gen eral at the offer ol incorporation In the great Republic. If, however, Canada and the •maritime Provinces would examine it from our standing-point* they might think differ enlly. Very probably the attention of En glish statesmen may be directed to the sub ject by it ; and, what evidently is more dif ficult to effect, Canadian politicians may be turned away from their bickerings and In trigues to consider a policv which will ad vance every Interest in the Province, find will give a healthy stimulus to trade, so tint progress will really be effected. It is hard, indeed, to understand the difference with which this important project has been created. The Annexation Canada and the PtOTinceM—The Ueport uf 3lr. Taylor and the BUI of General Qauha* [Correspci.dct.ee of Boston UaHj Advertiser.] Wasucigtox, July D, isac. The came of General Banks has become unwarrantably connected with one of the most important measures brought before the country nt the present session ol Congress. tu ; the bill for the annexation of Canada and the other British North American Pro vinces to the Untied States. Whether the project be wise or unwise. General Banks Is mno wise responsible for U, as I proceed to *>how by a brief statement. In the closing days of March there was in. trimuced Into llm. House a long resolution calling on the the Treasury for a statement of the trade In the British Provinces in 1804 and 1865, respectively * * “together with such Information as may be In nis possession, calculated to a-sist lu correctly estimating the trade resource* of said Provinces, and their relations to the trade and prodocliona of the United States ” The direct object of this Inquiry was to bnug out matter bearing upon the Recipro city Treaty question; tbo Indirect object was to give some ofllcial form to the and chaotic Ideas alluat regarding the annex ation of the Provinces. The reply to this resolution was laid be. foictho House a monthago. The Secretary's I letter la very brief, but it enclose* a docu ment prepared, under his direction, by Mr. James W. Taylor, special agent of the Treasury Department of the Minnesota Dis trict. ‘The closing pages of this paper,” tajb the Secretary, “contains some views upon the political relations of the United 1 States and British America, upon which I am not prepared to express an opinion at this time, but to which I Invite the atten tion of the House of Representatives.” This document is one of considerable length, and was evidently prepared with much care. It opens with a general state ment of the aggregate of trade with British America, and lollows with a detailed sum mary of trade with each of the Provinces—• Canada, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, the Winnipeg country, Athabasca district, Brit ish Columbia, and Vancouver’s Island. This detailed ‘summary embraces figures show log the amount ol exports and imports for a dozen years ; the comparative value of ex ports in 1854 and 

ISGS ; thtralue of the pro ducts ol Canadian mines, fisheries, fure?ts, animals, agriculture manufacture, &c.; the value of leading articles imported in 185-1 and IS<£, and the general operation of the Canadian tariff; as well as some account of the climate, soil, productions, and natural features and resources of Central and West ern British America, and a brief history of tbe exploration aud settlement of the vast scctiou lying between Canada and the Pacific Ocean. From this review, says Mr. Taylor in con cluding the first branch of bis report; “Of the relations oi Rse United states and British America, It Is evident that both communi ties are equally interested in two great objects: 1. An ocean navigation trom the Golf of £u Law rence to Lakes Superior and Michigan: and 2J An interaaDoaal railroad from Ball Car to the Norm raddc coast, on a roots central to tbe foxtcca of New Brunswick. Maine and Canada, ffac mineral formation of Lake Superior, tbo wheat growing plains of illrnefots, ana the Saskalche •an valley aid the gold district* ol British Co lumbia ” - The present ait nation of these two great interests is then briefly considered: “The pioblem,” be rays, “of which every 1 Northwestern htv-e ardently seeks tbe solution, is such immediate construed on of new, or en- ImcemetitofcxkUnccanals os will pas.* veas.|s ol nflcen hundred tons burden, without breakic? ! bulk, from the Gulf of Sl Lawrence, or the hal fcorofNcwYorb, to Chicago or Superior. At pretest the Superior eanal is alone a admen t, as I the Welland can only para a vessel of 4UO tons snd tbe fcu Lawrence canals caa pass a vewel ol only 2TO tons. Tbe New York, canals are of iw« capacity." In this connection tbe report brings for ward numerous figures showing the trade between Chicago and the lake country on tha one and the East and Europe on tha other; and finally adds that experience has proved that ireigbt charges from Chicago often cover seven-eighths of the value or a buahel of com, and more than half the value cf wheat at LlvcrpooL It la believed tha; the enlargement of the Welland and St. Lawrence canals would reduce the cost of gram transportation between the two points tuJly one-bait, - , The International railway project is also distressed, though bnt briefly. Mr. Taylor i believes that a bt. LaWrenceand Pacific road, even if aided by liberal allotments of land ulccg its line, will require at this time a gov emment subsidy of at least $100,000,000; and be dees not anticipate that England would assume any material portion of each an obli gallon; while the Province, even if confede rated on the plan somewhat agitated within the last two yean, would be utterly nuablo to undertake such a work daring this century. This abstract brings the report down to the “ political views ” upon which the secretory does not. now express an opinion. They are summed np In a single sentence, as fol lows : “1 cannot resist,” says Mr. Taylor, “the con clusion that events have presented to the people and Government of the United States ihe oppor lunlty—lei me rather say, have developed the duty—of Interposing bv an or enure to the people of the English colonies on this continent of course upon the fullest consultation with the Gov ernment of Great Britain, to unite their fortunes with tbe people and the Government ol the United States.” This is followcd-by the draft of “An act for tbe admission of the States of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Canada East, and Canada West, and for the organization of the Territories of Selkirk, Saskatchewan, and Columbia.” This Is, word for word, the an nexation bill with which the name of Gen eral Banks has become connected. Tbe Seo. retcry’s report, embodying this act, was sent ;o the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which General Banks is chairman. Uo wow directed to report the bill and have it re committed, simply to get it bciordihe com mittee and the country. That actionneither commits him nor hla committee to the an nexation project, nor to the scheme or this hill. What, now, is this scheme as devel oped In this bill? It proposes twelve articles, on the adop. tlon of which the Provinces shall become numbers of the Federal Union. These define the limits of the new States and Ter ritories, fix the Concessional representa tion of the States till the census of 1&70 convey to the United States ail public pnv pcrly of the Provinces, bind the Govern ment to assume and discharge their funded debt, andcontingent liabilities to the amount ofs'.'j,7oo.ooo, guarantee $10,000,000 U> the Hudson Bay Company In fall discbageofali cla'msto territory or Jurisdiction, require a survey of the public lands according to oar system, Ac.
