A Change of Front—Spanish Demands Refused—Trouble Anticipated. We stated at some length last week that the Cuban difficulties had al! been settled by the acceptance of the three demands made by our government upon Spain, vii: 1. The surrender of tha Virtrinius. 2. The restoration of ' D the crew. -3. A suitable indemnity lo the families of those slain. A protocol to this effect was made between Admi ral Polo and Secretary Fish. The acceptance of the propositions, i "seemed, ' would preclude all possibili ties of war, but the Spanish govern jnenl being powerless to enforce its' or ders in Cuba, has since asked to have the protocol modified so that the Vir- . . : i- l" -ji:. . gimns migm w u'" neutral power until its character could "be ascertained, and that she could not be surrendered in the harbor of Havana ,.f i1,a 1a mg. To VII lul , - uemand the Cabinet, on Saturday after a full discussion, refused to ac .cede or modify the protocol, and the opinion was expressed that the agree ment between the United States and Spain must be carried out, even if the American fleet is obliged to take the Virginius in Cuban waters. Congress will in all probability sustain this position taken by the Executive and Cabinet. It is elated that the Spanish govern ment, when it becomes satisfied that the Republic can not enforce its official orders upon its Cuban subjects, w make official admission of this fact; that a revolution exists on the island. and countenance our government in the seizure of the Virginius under the euns of Moro Castle. Should our government consent to a modification of the protocol which it will proba bly not and consent to the delivery of the vessel into other hands for ad judication, the affair may yet be ami cably adjusted. The prevailing opin ion is that we have made already too many concessions to wholly evade the stigmas of contempt and cowardice, and the government by public voice be compelled to stand by the existing pro tocol. Work in the navy yards is being rapidly pushed, and laboring forces increased. The Colorado eailed on Sunday. The Roanoke will be ready next week. The Powhattan and Man Lallan sailed for Key West on Friday Rmeivinr aliino- - --- meats in great numbers, and the situa tion snows that our government is getting ready for the worst A week will probably make large developments P. S. The latesl dispatches from Havana say: "The feeling in the city continues to improve. Opposition to the delivery of the Virginius is de creasing. Prominent Republicans and many Conservatives favor the delivery of the steamer, and adviee the cessa tion of hostilities." It is now asserted that the Virginius will be delivered to one of our naval vessels within the next ten days at a Cuban port in open day; and the surviving passengers and crew will be transferred to a United States ship at Santiago de Cuba in an equally open manner. If this is done it is supposed war will be avoided. 9Newepaper readers are now be ing bored by a great amount of sillv, sympathetic stuff about how "Boss Tweed" sleeps; the food he eats; bis cell and its furniture; bow he looks, acts, tc , in his new home in the peni tentiary. This man has stolen his millions from the people is undoubt edly the greatest thief of the age and why this sympathy? If he had been a common thief stolen $'10 from some citizen his penitentiary life would Lave received no attention. But being a big thief these writers must gnsb over him. Tweed deserves all the punishment he will get, and we care no more about his prison life than about others of lower grade.

Tl repeal is a measure almost onauj m insly demanded by the people, arj if members of Congress have art regard for the opinions of their cod tltaents they will pass the bill wit out extended discussion. JTThe Keystone Furnace, JacksJ county, is paying forty-five cents pJ cord for cutting wood. jgrThe Civil Service Examinio' Board was in session in Cincinnati lai week.

Va , has introduced a bill in Congress, to complete a water highway from James River to the Ohio, at the mouth of the Kanawha. It directs the Secretary of War to lay out, construct, enlarge and improve a water way from tide water on the James River at Richmond, Va , lo the Ohio River at the mouth of the Kanawha River, in West Virginia, by way of the James River and Kanawha Canal, the James, Jackson, Greenbrier, Neat and Kanawha Rivers, by canal, slackwater sluices or open river navi gation not less than eeienty feet wide and t-even feet deep, with locks not less than one hundred and twenty feet long and twenty feet wide, and with a ca pacity for vessels of at least S80 tons burden. The States of Virginia and West Virginia are to convey to the United States their interest in the properly or franchises of any corporation having a claim to the continuous line of water communication projected and in part completed by the State of Virginia, and the cost of the work lo be defrayed by the issuance and sale of United States ten-fifty four and a half per cent bonds lo the amiunt of $8.O0O,4piave purchase by the Secretary of War of private stock in the James River and Kanawha Company, at a price not ex ceeding twenty-five dollars per share, and also for the appointment of Com missioners to equip, maintain and manage 6aid water-way when com pleted, one each to be appointed from the States of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and West Virginia. .

President Grant's Message to Con gress, contrary to his productions in general, is one of extreme length. After the customary prelude of peace and prosperity with other nations; the international exhibition at Vien na; the Geneva award, and its use to redeem a portion of the public debt, the amount so redeemed being in vested in a five per cent, registra tion bond of $15,500,000, and the establishment of our northern bonn dry, he makes certain recommenda tions to Congress: 

ALABAMA CLAIMS. I recommend thsts commission be created for the purpose of auditing and determining the amounts of the several direct lossess growing ont of the destruction of vessels and tneir careoes br the Alabama and Shenan doah after leaving Melbourne, for which the sufferers hsve received no equivalent or compensation, and of ascertaining the names 01 persons entitled to receive compensation for the same making the computations on the baeis indicated by the I nou nal of Arbitration at Geneva. CITIZENSHIP. I invite Congress to mark out and define when and how expatriation can be accomplished; to regnlate by law the condition of American wo men marrying foreigners; to fix the status of children .horn in a foreign country of American parents, resid ing more or less permanently abroad; and to fix rules for determining such other kindred points as may seem best to Congress. ELECTION OF PRESIDENT AND VICEPREPREISDANT. PRESIDENT. For a constitutional amendment providing for the election of Presi dent and Vice President I make two suggestions for your consideration: First, To authorize the Executive to approve of so much of any measure passing the two Houses of Congress, as his judgment may dictate, with out approving the whole, the disap proved portion or portions to be subjected to the same rules as now, to wit: To be referred buck to the Ilonss in which the measure or measures originated, and if passed by a two-thirds vote of the two Houses, then to become a law with out the approval of the President. I would add tn this a provision thai there should be no legislation by Con gress during the last twenty four hours of its filling, except npon vetoes, in order lo give the Execu tive an opportunity to examine and approve or disapprove understand ingly. Second, to provide by amendment that when an extra session of Con gress is ordered by Executive pro clamation, legislation during: the continuance of such extra session, shall be confined to such subjects as the Executive may bring before it from time to time, in writing. THE 

PANIC. . permaneiriJjjroapplrllggj!lBn'j My own judgment is that however much individuals may have suffered, one long step has been taken toward specie payments; that we can never that a specie basis can not be reached and maintained until our exports) exclusive of gold to pay our imports, interest due abroad, and other specie obligations, are so heavy as to leave an appreciable accumulation of the precious metals in the country from the products or our mines THE CURRENCY. During the last four years the cur rency has been contracted directly by the withdrawal of three per cent. certificates, compound interest notes. and seven-thirty bonds outstanding on the 4th of March, 1869, all of which took the place of legal tenders in the bank reserves, to the extent of 863,000,000. During the same pe riod there has been a much larger comparative contraction of the cur rency; the population of the country has largely increased; more than twenty-five thousand milea of rail roads have been built, requiring the active use or caoital to operate them millions of acres of land have been opened to cultivation, requiring capital to move the products; manu factories have been multiplied beyond all precedent in the same period of time, requiring capital weekly for the payment of wages and for the purchase of material and probably the largest of all com- parative contraction arises from the organizing of free labor in the South. Now every laborer there receives his wages, and for want of saving banks, the greater part of such wages is carried in the pocket, or hoarded till required for use. These suggestions are thrown out for your considers tion, without any recommendation that they shall be adopted literally, but hoping that the best method may he arrived at to secure such an elas ticity of the currency as will keep employed an the industries or the country, and prevent such an infla tion as will put off indefinitely the resumpti n of specie payments, an object lo be devoutly wished for by an, and by none more earnestly than the class or people most directly in terested those who earn their bread by the sweat of their brow. The decision of Congress on this subject win have the hearty support of the Executive. 

EXPLORING EXPEDITION. I suggest a small appropriation be made, accompanied with authority the Secretary of the Navy to fit out a naval vessel to ascend the Amazon River to the mouth of the Madeirsj thence to explore that river and its tributaries into Bolivia, and report to Congress at its next session, or as soon as practicably, thp accessibility of the country by water, resources, and the population so reached. Such an exploration will cost bat little; it can do no harm, and may result iu establishing a trade value to both nations. ly of BANKRUPT ACT. I recommend that so much of the! act approved March 2, 1867, entitled "An act to establish a uniform ays tern of bankruptcy throughout the United States," as provides for Jn roluntary bankruptcy on agconnf; of suspension of payments be re pealed. CUBA AHD TQX EPAKISB QOBSTIOtf. The Spanish Government has re cognized the justice of oar demand, and has arranged for the immediate deliver? of the- vessel, and for the surrender of the survivors of.'the passengers ana crew, ana tor a snute to the flag, and far proceedings looking to the punishment of fcose who may be proved to have been guilty of illegal acts of violent to ward citizens of the United States, and also toward indemnifying liose who may be shown to be entrtld to indemnity. The embargoing1 of American estates in Cuba; eroelty to American citizens detecteH ii no act of hostility to the Spanish Gov ernment; the murdering of prisoners taken with arms in their hands; and, finally, the capture npon the high seas of a vessel sailing ondei the United States flag and bearing a United States registry, has crimi nated in an outburst of indignation that has seemed for a time to tlea ten war. Pending negotiation be tween the United States andj the Government of Spain on the sufiject of the capture, I have authorized the Secretary of the Navy to puf our navy on war footing to the exteit, at least, of the entire annual apprdria tion for that branch of the seance, trusting to Congress and the ptblio opinion of the American peopl'to justify my action. - GENERAL AMNESTY AND CIVIL RIGHTS. I renew my previous recommda tion to Congress for general amnsty. The number engaged in the latei re bellion laboring under disabilitits is very small, but enough to keeplp a constant irritation No posole danger can accrue to the Gotrn uient by restoring them to eligibility to hold oflice. ) I suggest for your consideration the enactment of a law to biter secure the civil rights which freejom should secure, but has not effectually secured to the enfranchised slae.
