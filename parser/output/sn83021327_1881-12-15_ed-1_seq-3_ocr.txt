A few day ago a colored man living on Walnut creek killed cow, the prop erly of one of his neighbors, and brought the bide to town and sold it.

In the county courtroom, lato yester day afternoon, a disagreement anu angry altercation occurred oeiween vouniy Attorney Moore and John Powell. Kmi a practicing attorney. Mr. Dowell was conducting t lie dcl'enso in the case ol tiihsou. charged with bigamy, mention or wb i i bus beeu made tu the statksman and, becoming oltendcd at some remark made by the prosecuting attorney, gave tho lie. whereupon the latter tnrew a gins al the former. Tho parties Wlrc placed under arrest, and Mr. Powell liued f IUU. The reporter of the Kau Antonio -pre thinks the Western In I on telegraph company should be the ktibject ot a law suit because in taking the president' message the other night the operator here railed to get oil' a "special'' to hi jour nal. Special telegrams, we believe, are private dispatches, and it would be a reasonable to enter suit against a job J muter because he refused to print a bus nes card, when pressed with other work. Tho Associated Tress dispatches, by a long established rule, take pre cedence over special telegrams, and the rule is a good one and should be en forced. The city appears to be filling up with hoodlum, cranks and tramps, and it bo hooves all to keep a sharp lookout about their premises. Yesterday morn ing, very early, two men, supposed to lie of the above brotherhood, entered Mr. driver's saloon, on the corner of Pecan and the Avenue. They called for drinks, throwing down Ave dollar bill. The bar-tender noticed at the tirst glance that t was a glaring counterfeit, and refused to take It. The hoodlum were dis posed to be angry, and wire about to make threatening demonstrations, when the appearance ol a wicked looking pis tol in the hands or the bartender caused them to leave tho saloon in short order and make olt down the Avenue. That part or the president's message niblilit-d by the Statesman Wednesday morning embraced nearly eleven thou sand words. When it Is remembered that all or this great mass or matter came over one wire, and received and writteu by oue operator, and that, loo, at lightning speed without cessation, the reader cau form some idea ol the im mensity or the labor uecessary to the task. This work was performed by Mr. W. A. Tillow, the clever night operator In the Austin ofllce, and Hie beauty or hi rapid mauipulatiou ol the key is, that he furnishes what a printer would call " donble-IOAded " CJpy that is, good, legible manuscript.

J Waterproof and black doeskin, at hot iu' uKurea, at i. jmieviQsy s. lthlnd tha Prison Kara. Yesterday morning a Statf.smax rep resentative visited and went througn the jail. The cell room and corridor are scrupulously clean, but the peculiar prison odor familiar to all the readers of the StaTksmaS who have been lu jail we mean, of course, as visitors broods everywhere within the prison, and one wontlers how the iumatci bear up so well and keep as healthy as they do. Iu one of the upper cells the States man's man found Rube IJoyee. To the quest ion. "how are you getting alon?" be replied 'Frettv well." 'Are you doing anything about per fecting your bond?" 'Well, yes. my father has the bond up In Llano and he thinks he can get good and acceptable men on it. There were good men here to go ou It bill Judge Kiiir gles could never be found and tuey could not remain in the city. I don't believe he wanted me to make up an acceptable bond." Rube then quietly chuckled and said: ''I don't care much now, whether the bond is made up or not. as court meets next month and I am ready lor trial. All my witnesses, I think, are near about, and will be on hand. I fear, how ever, that the government will want to put It off." To the question, "what kind of provi sions were furnished the inmates or the prison ,"' he said : "Not the best in the world. It is erally corn bread and beef, straight. At breakrast wc have luht bread and coflce., mki sometimes a little pork." Do you ever have any vegetables?"' "No; but I get one meal a day Iroiu a restaurant, and do pretty well." "How sire mil treated by the prison oilicials?"' "Oh, tirst rate ; we have no cau.-e to complain." Here the reporter lelt Rulie, and vis ited the cell occupied by Mr. Hanks, con victed a lew days ago for forging land titles. He declared that one ol the state witnesses perjured himself to clear his own skirts, and that he proposed to make a clean breast ol the whole matter and show it up in the public, prints. J. H. Harris, one of the Lampasas stage robbers, was found in a dark cell, he having been confined there some four weeks ago a a punishment for attempt ing to saw out of prison. Jle says lie was raised in Birmingham, New York, Is about twenty-nine years of age and is not a bud-looking man. He showed the reporter, as well as he could iu the dim lijrht or his dark aud dreary ell. the ulace where he was wounded at the time of ills arrest. "It was getting! prcttv close to me; wasn't it?" he said, as he placeil himself in close contact with the cell door and displayed an ugly scar, about three inches below tue suoui der, and two or three from the spinal col umn. As the reporter was aoout to move on. Harris called hnu tiacK, anu said : 'Didu't vou. in the published account of my arrest, say I was one of Billy the Kid's most true and tried friends?' " 'Yes, I believe the accouut did say that.'' Well. I wish vou would correct it. 1 was sliulitlv acquainted with him, but never had anything to do with him in my life." The reporter talked with several other prisoners, iill of whom complained a lit tle about the food, but were as well satis lied iu other respects as it is possible for inmates of a prison to ne.

Sometimes theiunocent the guileles farmer, with hair tilled with hay seed, departs Irom the oath of rectitude and calmly mean ders down the broad way which leads to much trouble aud disgrace. A lew days o'o the well known cotton buyers lulchart Jc I'liltcrsou. purchased three bales ol cotton, iney tooK tuo samples from the cdcofthe bales, as customary, and they indicated a superior staple, aud the innocent looking farmer received the highest market price. The cotton was rolled aside uutll Thursday when Messrs. Iglehart & Tatter son concluded to ship a quautity to Gal veston, among it the three Dale men tioned. At the depot, before loading into the cars, these bales attracted the attentinu ot some one and in pulling out samples it was discovered that the inte rior or the bales was very poor anu irasuy cotton. The farmer, up to the way cotton is usually sampled, bad taken a high L'lade of cotton and "plated" the bales, As soon as this was discovered thc.cottoo was sent back to the yards, and Messrs. Isrlehart & Tatterson will trace it up and ascertain the farmer, who will have no end of trouble. "Fell AsbM-p in J es its" Annie Sl.ilnaker, lleremlicr o, IKS I. Words spoken by the Rev. T. B.

STANDARD ON BLAINE. London, December 13. Tho Standard, iu a leading article ou Blaine's instructions sent to the American minister at Lima, savs It may be absurd, but it is only car rying the Mouroe doctrine to its le gitimate conclusion to assume that bye-and-bye we shall see representa tives departed Irom Washing ton to control the relations of the emperor of Brazil with the Luropean powers and the savages of Patagonia, in voking the aid of the United States to compose their differences. What is the temper of the cabinet at the present moment, wc can only infer from the growth of the Chaubiuer sentiment, w hich has been conferred a discussion of the canal question As to Peru, it Is not, however, a matter of sentiment. It is true that Blaine has resigned, and Americans will not longer have to admire the glowing periods in which-he has maintained the pretensions of his country. But American diplomacy is uniform, and it will be much the same, whether the dispatches are penned by Frclinghuyseu or Blaine, It is not improbable that President Arthur may soon announce that peace is restored aud u new pro tectorate established by the United States.
