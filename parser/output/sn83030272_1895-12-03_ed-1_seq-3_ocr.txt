until the President bn frt math his recommendations to Congress What the Presi dent has determined to recommend has already been decided upon and his advice and sugges tions are In tho form of 0 message which will be rend to tho two Houses of Congress tomorrow The communication would have been submitted tony but for the confusion attendant upon the ewcarlng In of the members of tho new House

life of this Congress and Im mediately after tomorrows session begins tho Presidents message will h read Tho noticeable Incidents o todays session were the great preponderance of Republicans in tho membership of tho House tho absoncoof the familiar faces of the prominent men of the last Congress particularly on tho Democratic eldo of the chamber anil the posing of the several wouldbe leaders on the Republican side In his treatment of these aspiring friends Mr llccd showed his usual adroitness and at the close of the days session no fairminded man a able to say which of them had been mot prominent during the proceedings or who had come most often beneath the Speakers favoring eye Tho perfunc tory resolutions that were Introduced and the motions that mode perfunctory were prfonctor motons mao with regard to organization were so evenly dis tributed between Dlngley Payne Cannon Del tell Bontelle and Henderson that each felt as important o the other and were undoubtedly EO regarded by their colleagues and the vast crowd of spectators in tho galleries and will undoubtedly bo so regarded by the public nut tjpcakor Reed places his finger upon one of them and says Thou art tho man

the leaders His prominence will not be apt to last long how over for the gentleman first named will divide the desirable honors among themselves Payne of New York or Dlngley of Maine probably the latter will b Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and Can non of Illinois or Henderson of Iowa probably Ihe latter will beChalrman of the Committee tn Appropriations Dalzell is likely t get the Uialrmanshlp of the Judiciary Committee and JJoatello of Maine is sure t co back to tho Chairmanship of the Committee on Kaval Af fairs which he held in the Fiftyfirst Congress The one who falls to got the Ways and Means Committee will b appointed the ranking mem ber uf the Committee on Banking and Cur rency undoubtedly and the one who is disap pointed in his ambition to b Chairman of tho Committee on Appropriations will get a com mittee almost equally as good Mr Hltt of Illinois who will b Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs because ho Is one of Tom Reeds chums who occupied that honorable place in the Fiftyfirst Congress and because he is 0 man marked ability was not in evidence today Huts I not In robust health and If I moreover a very modest mip vho Is nllllnir to

COLOURD MEN AUMITTKIl Following tho action taken In tho caucus on Saturday night when thin claims of the col ored men for recognition In the distribution of patronage were Ignored the Republicans today shut thrlr colored brethren absolutely out of all participation In the interesting proceedings thnt took place within the nails of tho historic cham ber Heretofore the entire sectIon of the gal lery on tho north side of tho chamber bat been open a nil times to tho public white and black under tho rule of first come first served Taking advantage of that Democratic privilege this gallery has always been on Interesting occasions crowd ed with representatives of tho colored race whoso faces mode a black wall along tho entire side of tho chamber TOHRV tho public gal leries were closed to all persons not bearing cards of admission from the members of the House Tho result was that what has long been known ns tho Crows Nest was filled with white people of both sexes while the colored brethren and those of the white rnco who did not pos sess tho necessary card were allowed to trump the corridors outside the chamber The fact that for the fIrst time In many years tho col ored race has no representation In either House of Congress may have had something to do with the adoption of the rule There were not so many floral offerings as usual on the desks of members today Gen erally hundreds of desks are covered with roses and other lowers but toda not more than 0 dozen members were remembered In this way The desk ot Speaker Reed of course was piled 8 high with the beautiful sweetscented de signs of various sorts that tho now Speaker giant AS ho Is could hardly sea over them AS ha made his little speech of thanks Mr Reed was apparently OB calm and cool as over today but ho stumbled just a little on three or four occa sions after ho ha been sworn In and perhaps ne was not so unmoved us ho appeared In his hour of triumph Ho was dressed In a long block frock coat closely buttoned with stand ing collar and 0 steelgray tourlnhand cravat t bat littlo hair Is I left on his great round white head was closely trimmed and the absence of the familiar little moustache made his chubby but strong face look vv hlter and moro babylike I than usual When addrcscng the House he stood in his customary attitude with his hands behind his back and made no attempt at gestic

William Itrookflold who retired jesterdny from office as Commissioner nf Public Works said that ho will have a statement to make in two or three days absars his attitude toward the Republican county

the circumstances will bodl cusud A chance In thu party administration cald he Is greatly needed and It should bo tine work of all Republicans who are In favor of clean politics to assist In working

ho proposed to head n boll against the Iauterbnch machine ho replied that ho would not talk on that sub ject just yet One of his allies said Ilrookfield Is anxious to form a new County Committee and ants to fight tire 1latt ma chine In tire city and State He would like to call on all his friends to join him In the move ment He has discovered though that sonic of them absolutely will not join others tell him that n call to arms would greatly embarrass them others would go Into the thing because Mr llraokflcld wants them to but nut with any Heart for the fight We have all agreed that wo will meet Ilrookflold and confer with him as to the best thing to be done and ha will certainly not issue any declaration of war until after that conference Among the conservative nntlPlaU men who opposeitho proposition to start a now county or ganization are Gen Alison II McCook and Col Uuorifo Bliss Ion MeConk will not discuss tire subject but tho fact that ho Is being attacked by John K Mllholland and others who favor the now County Committee Idea Indicates what a stand ha has taken among his friends Col George lilies had this to say yesterday about the scheme I am not in sympathy with the idea of a separate organization ouch a movement ought to be the very last resort Tho plan of enrollment and the manner in which It was ob tained were such as Mr Lautorbach and his friends cannot defend and make no attempt to defend Mr Lauterbach assumed powers not granted by the constitution of the organization and the enrollment was In consequence Illegal The lists are bogus and every one knows they are bogus But I must say that Mr Lautor bachs friends are not alone to bo condemned In this respect Tine County Committee Is discred ited with the better clement of the party and must continue to be discredited The organization Is weak and in no condition to carry on the Meht which must be waged by thu party next year lire County Committee will not be recognized by the Republican Na tional Committee because the men who are op posed to It are those who always contribute most liberally to national campaign funds It must remain In its present discredited bank rupt condition until the end What the out come ot the condition within the party will bo I do nnt know I am strongly opposed to the formation another County Corumittcethongh until such action shall beacon to be actually nec essary The present organization is rotten and 1 believe will fall to pieces of Its own rotten ness Uneof the objections which someof the Brook field men mace to their chiefs plan for a separate organization is tine fact that by form ing it they would lose Line chance of electing national delegates In two or three of the city Congress districts One of the things which thus leaders had In mind when they revised the rolls of the organization wits the election of national delegates Till Lauterbacb men tried to capture all the districts and the brookfield men to save ihoio that they now have Iho Urookflclders control now In the Ninth Twelfth Thirteenth and Fifteenth districts Since the enrollment it looks as though casey will control only in tine Thirteenth with the possible chance of having a majority In the Twelth and Thirteenth The Congress conventions ore big unwleldly affairs however and there is no knowing just how a close district will go until the Conven tion is held It denendn very mtlrh nn the temporary Chairman and ho will OH named by the County Commltteee The regular organiza tion does not want any McKinley delegates sent from New York city or any delegates who wonld not vote with the great body of dele gates sent from the rest of tOe State The ob jections to Mr in case of a bolt the HrooUleltl Assembly districts would be reorganized and there would bo no chance of their side electing n single national delegate These objection are answered by the suggestion that a separate county organization might send delegates to the National Conven tion from all the Congress districts and demand recognition on the score that these delegates represent all tire wealth of the city which can bo drawn on for campaign purposes
