Marble Hill Press HILL & CHANDLER, Publisher. MARBLE HILL, " - MISSOURI With apologies to the hen, why is a Ereen hat ? Mrs. Langtry is 50 years old a fact shown only by the records. With a three-year-old emperor China should have no fear of the sovereign talking too much. Rockville. Conn., has the distinction of being the first town to arrest an air ship for disorderly conduct. Some one has reported seeing a sea serpent off Newport, but maybe, after all, it was just the back bone of winter wiggling into place. In prehistoric times, says a Chicago lady lecturer, woman was mentally the superior of man. Is she arguing that something has happened since? The simplified spelling board wants ns to spell it "det." Of course that makes it easier to spell, but not any easier to get out of a spell of it. A man in Chicago has been ordered by the court not to speak to his wife for two weeks or allow her to speak to him. Which one was the plaintiff? The daughter of Lombroso is com ing to this country to study our pris ons. We may be thankful, after all the other fulminations against it, thai she isn't coming to study our society. All the world is ready to admire the taste of iie man who fell in love with a young woman and married her because she thanked him when he gave her his seat and when she turned and sat down "her waist and skirt did not separate." A Philadelphia man left his son-in-law 50 cents with which to buy a rope to hang himself. The beneficiary will probably forego the bequest rather than comply with its conditions, but It is certainly a terrible tale to come from the City of Brotherly Love. Prof. D. C. Jackson of the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology has been retained by the Massachusetts highway commission to make a report regarding the telephone situation with special reference to the practicability of a reduction in rates and a higher efficiency of service. The official denial of the Abruzzi-El-kins engagement will shatter a ro mance in which two continents were deeply interested, and many will re fuse to give up the hope that the path of true love may yet be smoothed for the royal lover and the beautiful American girl of his heart. The recent refrigeration congress in Europe has reminded a student of his tory that Francis Bacon made the first experiments in the use of snow for the preservation of meat. The people of New Zealand, who have been largely dependent on refrigerated meat, have shown their appreciation of Bacon's discovery by erecting a statue of him suitably inscribed. A minister recently read a paper be fore a Congregational church confer ence in Boston in which he called at tention to the fact that in the mem bership of 56 churches in that vicinity only one child to each church was born during the year. His conclusion was that Congregational families are ceasing to perpetuate themselves and that Puritan stock is dying out. Presi-1 dent Roosevelt ought to look into this. ! At the recent dedication in Bath of a tablet to Edmund Burke, Whitelaw Reid spoke in behalf of Americans in honor of their best friend in Great Britain. Burke has become almost a national hero in America, and it was he who phrased most eloquently many principles that are part of our tradi tion. His "Speech on Conciliation" is a difficult piece for schoolboys, but it ought always to be a part of the pre scribed reading of young America. The Ohio-Mississippi coal trade, which persists to-day, is one of the greatest single movements of cargo in the world. From I'ittsburg to New Orleans is 2,000 miles, all downhill. Coal in 1,000-ton barges is rafted into fleets and towed down this distance by powerful steamboats at a cost oJ less than 75 cents a ton, against a railroad rate of about four dollars and fifty cents from Pittsburg to Mem phis for 43 cents, against a rail rate of $2.70. s The president of the University oi Illinois has announced that dismissal will in future be the punishment oi hazing, which he denounces as a vio lation of the right of individuality, provocative of public disorder, in its milder forms nonsensical, and in its coarser forms vulgar, brutal, always demoralizing and sometimes danger cms. Hence, he says, the university cannot countenance or tolerate it. Such a stand in the opinion of the In dianapolis Star generally imitated, will soon end the practice. A Chicago burglar broke into a hos pitalpital and took everything but the patients' temperatures, we presume. Our referendum among the leading personalities of this country on the question, "What is your opinion of the great nseu of Europe and America?" has resulted as follows: Washington and Napoleon are the greatest favor ites, after whom come Hannibal. Cae sar and Charles XII. of Sweden. Among the most disliked are Brutus, Cromwell and Darwin. Nihanoyabi Is'ihonjiu (Tokyo). FOR

FLEET LOSES TWO MEN. Electrician and Fireman of Battleship New Jersey Fall Into the Sea. Colombo. Ceylon. The American battleship fleet, on its homeward voyage, will reach here Sunday. The following wireless message announces the progress of the fleet: "The fleet at 8 p. m December 10, was in latitude 5.26 north, longitude 88.15 east. Will arrive at Colombo at 8 o'clock Sunday morning. Perfect weather. Speed ten knots.

McDonald was rescued, but Stawicki was not recovered, although a thor ough search was made for him. "Otherwise, the trip from Manila has been uneventful. There has been much tactical maneuvering daily." ROOSEVELT TO HIT BACK. "8ullett8" for Congress if It Rebukes Him for Secret Service Message. Washington. "President Roosevelt never shoots in the air," said a member of congress Saturday to another who was asking if there was any thought that the president had bullets as well as powder to fire back at the house and senate if they should rebuke him in a resolution sav age enough to bring a quick fire re sponse. The belief is that the president has material which is contained in offi cial but unpublished reports, which, if made public, would cause conster nation in some fairly high places. It is not to be conceived that Roose velt wants to use this material if he has it, but, for the thousandth time, it must be said he is a fighter, and will hold that self-defense does not consist merely in parrying. One of the most prominent repre sentatives said Saturday that he had no doubt at all that there could be a response from the White House to any censure that congress might in flict, and that he believed some men would be hurt. Gen. Simon Takes Gonaives. Washington.

ARMY INCREASE CARRIE IS "BOUNCED." Proprietors of Public Houses Uncere moniously Fire Mrs. Nation Out. Dundee, Scotland. The reception Mrs. Carrie Nation of Kansas is getting from the keepers of public houses here is the worst she ever experienced. Many times she has been "bounced" unceremoniously and ungailar.tly from "pubs'' into the crowded street, where mobs jeered and cheered her promiscuously. Carrie has been shocek to find tea drinking so common in Scotland, where, in deed, an amazing quantity of the beverage is consumed at all hours of the day. She classes tea drinking with the morphine habit, and has added it to her crusading repei toire. The police have not acted on the request of one public house keeper, who wants her prosecuted for breach of the peace in entering his place of business. Brayfield Hearing December 16. Benton. 111.
