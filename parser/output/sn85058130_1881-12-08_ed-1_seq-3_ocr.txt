satisfac tion and commendation Some disap pointment ii expressed that hA did not more distinctly and definitely enunciate ft policy This feeling hewever IMDIB confined to thoio who hop for the de minion of a faction of the party Repub lieu generally think tko President mean to entirely ignore factions and to heal dusantioni aad art glad he re i trained free saying anything that could I be seized upon by either faction Wilt Ull republicans especially those from the silver producing states are not pleased At the recommendation to limit silver I coinage but they console themselves I with the belief that Congress will not carry out that recommendation As to the Presidents message among senators and congressmen of all shades of politics the belief appears to be that it is a very able document Opinions as to the correctness of its conclusions vary of course according to party affiliation and individual sentiment but there is a general agreement that in clearness of style dignity of tone and force and fresh ness of argument it is far above the average level of the annual presidential messages for a number of years and that it indicates the possession by its author of a much higher grade of ability than has heretofore been commonly attributed to him There are some disappointment aaaong Pacific Coast representatives a be absence of any hearty recommen dation for legislative action to restrict Chinese immigration especially as the President takes pains to sug gest that Congress should care fully regard the interests and sus ceptibilities of the Chinese government in legislating upon that subject On the other hand it is noticed with gratification that the message does say that legislation is necessary to carry the treaties into effect and also that the President signifi cantly though not so openly as might be desired refers to the evils of unrestricted Chinese immigration when he says that our government views with concern the efforts to seek the replenishment of the I diminished population of the Sandwich Islands from outward sources i President Arthurs vigorous utterances upon the Mormon question give unal loyed satisfaction to the Pacific Coast people and all other opponents of polyg amy and will probably have a decided influence on the result of the pending contest in regard to the admission of Campbell as aa antiMormon delegate It is considered highly probable that the republican members of tbe House will solidly sustain Speaker Keifer in the position taken by him today in favor of Campbell and these combined influences will also it is believed be reinforced by many democratic members whose abhor ance of Mormonism will lead them to forgo the possible iyantogo of embar rassing the republican speaker which is apparently the purpose of the opposition led by exSpeaker Randall EG that on the whole Campbells admission seems to be pretty well assureed Chicago 7The Times criticises the Presidents message as beingmore like an address from the throne than any docu ment of tho kind since Washingtons time but commends it for its nonpar tisan features The Tribune finds the message objec tionable for its recommendations on the silver question and for its unusual length The InterOcean regards it as a digni fied worthy document a vigorous and straightforward message and one of the best given to the country for fifteen years All journals notice its great length London 7The liaily Telegraph on the message As long as reform in the civil service remains unaccomplished the danger that public interest will be sacri ficed to faction and that corruption will prey upon the vitals of the state must endure The dread catastrophe has given an awful warning and the belt in terests of the noble people demand that showy promises bl promptly followed by solid performances New York T Journals are crowded to day with the Presidents message and document incident to the opening of the caw Congress The message itself is universally well spoken of particularly II by republican and independent sheets The World says The message in a word is full of views aad the views are not pretended to be the views of the country or even of the party but only personal opinions of the fttttkor of the message which are to be taken as the saying is for wha they are worth J No careful reader of the message can fail to note this pecul arity and few reflecting readers will be able to assign it to its true cause It is the same cause which made the letter of acceptance of tha republican candidate for Vice President last year so much more outspoken and positive than the otter of the republican candidate for President The World concludes In re gard to finances and our foreign relations tho President speaks with force and clearness which will command the re eat of patriotic men of all parties H VI r TM c J m H 1M H FI 0 A Bewrtifial Variety of PRO o
