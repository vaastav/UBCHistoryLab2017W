This legislation will, I doubt not, duty of investigating this subject be in trusted, in the first instance, to a compc tent commission.

As these bonds still .constitute the chief basis for the circulation of the national banks, the question how to avert the con traction of the curreucy caused by their retirement is one of constanly increas ing importance. It ally conceded that the law governing this matter exacts from the banks excessive security and that upon their present bond deposits a larger circulation than is now allowed may be granted with safety, I hope that the bill which passed the sen ate at the last session permitting the is sue of notes equal to the face value of dc posited bonds, will commend itself to the approval of the house of representatives The report of the secretary of the navy exhibits the progress which has been made on the new steel cruisers author ized by the acts of Aug. 5, 1S82, and Mar 3,1883.

According to the annual report of the chief signal officer, General Haz en, which has just been published, careful estimates have been made of the percentage of accuracy, showing 84.6 per cent, for New England and for the whole country 85 4 per cent. The total number of cautionary sig nals displayed during the year was 2776 ; the number justified was 2287, or 82.4 per cent of the whole. It is shown that during the year no gener al storm passed over the count! y without warning. Of the total num ber of cautionary off-shore signals displayed, 93,5 percent, were justi fied as to direction and 88.6 percent, as to velocity.

It seems proper to la this, the last of the stated messages that I shall have the honor to transmit to the congress of the United States, I cannot too strongly urge on its attention the duty of restoring our navy as rapidljT as possible to the high state of efficiency which formerly characterized it. As the long peace that has lulled us into a sense of fancied security may at any time be disturbed. It is plaiu that the policy of strengthening this arm of the service is dictated bv considerations of wise econo my, of just regard for onr future tran quility, and of true appreciation of the dignity and honor of the republic. On the Mormon question he uses some what vigorous language. The report of the Utah commission will be read with interest. It discloses the result or receut legislation looking to the prevention and punishment of polygamy in that territory. I still believe if this abominable practice can be suppressed by law it can only be by the most radical legislation consistent with the restraints of the constitution. I again recommend, therefore, that con gress assume absolute political control reduction in working force and in wages. Happily employees general ly show a disposition to bear Ibeir adverse fortune philosophically and The hotel corridors are filled with members of congress and prominent men from all parts of the country. u my opinion, underlie our national ef forts in this direction. The main condi tions of the problem may be thus stated : We are a people active in mechanical pur suits and Tertile"iu invention. We cover a vast extent of territory, rich in agricul tural products and in nearly all the raw materials necessary for successful manu facture. We have a system of productive establishment more than sufficient to sup ply our own demands. The wages of labor are no where else so great. The scale of living of onr artisan classes is such ns tends to secure their personal comfort and the development' of those higher moral and intellectual qualities that go to the making up of good citizens. Our system of tax and tariff legislation is i yielding a revenue which is in excess of the present needs of the government. These are elements from which it is sought to devise a scheme by which, without unfavorably changing the condi tion of our workingman, our merchant marine shall be raised from its enfeebled condition and new markets provided for the sale beyond our borders of the mani fold f: uits of our industrial enterprises. The problem is complex, and can be solved by no single measure of innova tion or reform. The countries of the American continent aud the adjacent is lands are for the Unitcd States the natu ral marts of supply an I demand. It is from them we should obtain what we do not produce, or do not produce in sufficiency, and it is to them that the surplus productions of our fields, our mills and our workshops should flow under conditions that will equalize or favor them in comparison with for eign competition. Four paths of policy seem to point to this end : First, a series of reciprocal commercial treaties with the countries of America which shall foster between us and them an unhampered movement of trade. The conditions of these treaties should be the free admission of such merchandise as this country does not produce in return for thc admission free or under a favored scheme of duties of our own products, the benefits of such exchange to apply only to goods carried under the flag of the parties to the contract, the removal on both sides from the vessels so privi leged of all tonnage dues and national imports so that their vessels may ply un hindered between our ports and those of the other contracting parties, though without infringing on the reserved home coasting trade; the removal or the re duction of burdens on the exported prod ucts of those countries coming within thc benefits of the treaties, and the avoid ance of the technical restrictions and penalties by which our intercourse with those countries is at present hampered. Secondly, The establishment of the consular service of the United States on a salaried footing, thus permitting the relinquishment of consular fees, not only as respects vessels under the national flag, but as respects vessels of the treaty nations, carrying goods entitled to the benefit of the treaties. Thirdly, The enactment of measures to favor the construction and maintenance of a steam-carrying marine under the flag of the United States. Fourthly, The establishment of an uni form currency basis for the countries of America, so that the coined products of our mines may circulate on equal terms throughout the whole system of common wealths. This would require a monetary union of America whereby the outputs of the bullion-producing countries and the circulation of those which yield neither gold nor silver could be adjusted in con formity with the population, wealth and commercial needs of each. As many of the countries furnish no bullion to the common stock the surplus production of our mines and mints might thus be util ized and a step taken toward the general remonetization of silver. To the accom plishment of these ends, so far as they can be attained by separate treaties, the negotiations already concluded and now in progress have been directed, and the favor with which this enlarged policy has thus far been received warrants the be lief that its operations will ere long em brace all, or nearly all, the countries of this hemisphere. It is by no means desir able, however, that the policy under con sideration should be applied to these countries alone. The healthful eniarg ment of our trade with Europe, Asia and Africa should be sought, by reducing tariff burdens on such of their wares as we nor other American states are fitted to produce, and thus enabling ourselves to obtain in return a better market for supplies of food, of raw materials and of thc manufactures in which we excel. It seems to me that many of the embar rassing elements in the great national conflict betweeu protection and free trade may thus be turned to good account. That the revenue may be reduced, so as no longer to overtax the people, that pro tective duties may be retained without becoming burdensome, that the shipping interests may be judiciously encouraged, the currency fixed on a firm basis and above all such a unity of interest estab lished amoug the states of the American system as will be of great aud increasing advantage to them all. All treaties in the line of this policy which have been negotiated or are in process of negotia tion contain a provision, deemed to be requisite under the clause of the consti tution, limiting to the house of represent atives the authority to originate bills for raising revenue. On the 29th of February last I trans initted to the congress the first annual report of the civil serv ice commission, together with communications from the heads of the several executive depart ments of the government. Respecting the practical workings of the law under which the commission had been acting, the good results therciu foreshadowed have been more than realized. The sy tern has answered the expectations of its friends in securing competent and faith ful public servants, and in protecting the appointed officers of the government from the pressure of personal importunity, and froui the labor of examining the claims anil pretentions of rival candidates for public employment. The law has had the unqualified support of the president and of the heads of the several departments and the members of the commission have performed their duties with zeal and fi delity. Their report will shortly be sub rnitted, and will be accompanied by such recommendations for enlarging the scope of the existing statute as shall commend themselves to the executive and the com missioners charged with its administra tion. In view of the general and persis ent demand throughout the commercial community for a national bankrupt law, I hope that the differences of sentiment which have hitherto prevented its euact nieut may not outlast the present session. I recommend that, in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late general of the armies of the United States and tw ice president of this nation, that congress confer upon him a suitable pension. As the time draws nigh when I am to retire from the public service, I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of the national legislature, with whom I have been brought into personal and offi cial intercourse, my sincere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy aud of . their harmonious co-operation with the execu tive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of the nation, and to my fellow-citizens generally I ac knowledge a deep sense of obligation for the support which they have accorded me in my administration of the executive ive and Let Live !
