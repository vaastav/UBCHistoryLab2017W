Unfortunately, the rush of modern business win not permit tne aver age hard working business man to turn cow boy even for a short time each year. The only resource left him, if he does not wish la break down prematurely, is to keep watchful eye upon his health, and when he finds that he is getting out of sorts, let up little on work, and resort to the best of all known tonics. That tonic is Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It promptly puts a worked out man into condition, be cause it starts at the right place. It begfna by restoring the lost appetite. It corrects all disorders of the digestion and makes the assimilation of the food perfect. It invig orates the liver. It purifies the blood and fills it with th life-giving elements of the food. It is the great btnod maker and flesh builder. By enriching the blood it nour ishes and builds up every organ and tissue in the body. No man ever broke down with nervous exhaustion or prostration who re torted to this great medicine when he felt himself threatened by ill-health. An honest dealer will not urge a substi tute. There Is nothing in the world "just as good," although avaricious drug gists will sometimes any so for the sake of the greater profit to be made upon the inferior article.

The amend ments offered by democrats to correct alk'ired existing abuses were all ruled out on the point of order that they were new legislation. As passed, the bill carries 8:-ll,l,N80. The debute covered a wide range. It touched not only the question of our pension poli cy, but that of civil service reform and the receipts and expenditures of the treasury under the Dingley law. On the latter question, Mr. Dingley made an important statement, in which he expressed the opinion that the receipts would equal the expenditures before the close nf the present fiscal year, and predicted a surplus of 810,000,000 next year, The civil service law was sav agely uttucked by several members, notably by Mr. Drown, republican, of Ohio, and Mr. I.inney, republican, of North Carolina, and was warmly de fended by Mr. Johnson, republican, of Indiana.

The person bribed is declared to be a competent witness anil not liable to prosecution under this act. The bill also provides imprisonment of not more than one year for any creditor, employer, over seer or agent who attempts to coerce or intimidate any electors, debtors or other person under their authority to vote contrary to their inclination, or leter him from voting.

Washington, Dec, 11. -It was stated in reliable quarters about the house of representatives yesterday that Secre tary Uage had made his purpose known not U embody his financial views in me comprehensive bill, but to cover special subjects in a number of special bills, some of which would go before the house committee on banking and currency and others before the com mittee on ways and means. The banking and currency committee had formally invited the secretary to pre sent a bill covering all the phases of financial reform suggested lu his re cent recommendation to congress, and the desire of members of the commit tee was to treat the subject as an en tirety. For that reason there was con siderable comment when It was stilted that Mr. Uage would divide the sub ject Into several bills, some of which would go before the ways and means committee, I1KMOCRATS TO C'AIXTS. Washington, Dec, 11. Chairman Richardson, of the democratic caucus, yesterday Issued a call for a caucus on Tuesday evening next, December 14, to consider the four subjects of Cuba, Hawaii, finance and bankruptcy. As to the action on these, a pretty general understanding has been reached among the democratic leaders. On the subject of Cuba the sentiment Is prac tically unanimous in favor of a resolu tion favoring the recognition of Cuban belligerency. On financial questions the caucus probably will take a posi tion agaiust the several plans of finan cial reform recommended by Secretary Uage. Opposition to the bankruptcy bill is also contemplated by the caucus. On the question of Hawaiian annexa tion it Is stated by those who have canvassed the feeling on the demo cratic side that it is practically unani mous against annexation, either by treaty or legislation. CIVIL SH.ItVICK CONFKRKNCK. Washington, Dec, 11, Representa tive Pearson, of North Carolina, has secured Ti signatures to the paper cir culated among republican members of congress for a conference relative to the civil service law, In speaking of the conference Mr, Pearson said It should be understood that quite a number of those members who signed the cull were in favor of the civil serv ice Idea, They felt, however, that the principle itself was at stake by the present administration of the law and they were, therefore, ready to join in considering what remedy could be had for the present defects.

Chicago, Dec. 10. There are 111 widows of the war of 1812 drawing pensions of 88 per month from the government pension agency in Chi cago, aud there are 17 other agencies in the country. Although there are only 14 survivors of this war now liv ing, there are 8,287 widows of men who fought In 1812 drawing 88 per month from the government. As this war closed 83 years ago, It is argued that these widows must have been very young and their husbands ex tremely aged at the time of the mar riages.

BIKIKKR WASHINGTON S GOon ADVICE. Washington, Dec. 10. Hooker T. Washington, the founder and head of the Industrial school for colored peo ple at Tuskegee, Ala., advises the men of his race to keep out of politics and not to seek office. "Don't try to gov ern the country," he says to them, "until you know how. Educate your self and take care of your own inter est), and promote your own fortunes and leave the Interests of other people to oo cared for by men of education and experience." Mr. Washington came to this city the other day to have an interview with the president, but was not able to do so, owing to the hitter's absence in Canton. He would have advised the president against the appointment of colored men to office In the south. He says that it stimulates an ambition among their friends and the members of the race generally to seek a living by pol itics instead of by the trades and other Industries, and has a demoralizing In fluence. At the same time it provokes hostilities among the whites and keeps alive race prejudices. The only career Mr. Washington sees for bis race is in industrial and agricultural education.

RESOLDTIOSOS CUBA Mr. Allen Urges the Recognition of the Island's Independence. INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE WAY. Holders or Spanish Bonds end Owners of Froperty In Cuba the Onee That Pre vent Caba'i freedom Peueloa Appropriation Bill. Washington, Dec. 9. The first gun. in congress for Cuban independence was fired in the senate yesterday by Senator Allen, of Nebraska. He offered a resolution declaring It to be the sense of the senate that congress should, with all due convenient speed, acknowledge by appropriate act the po litical independenceof Cuba. Mr. Allen said that he had long urged the United States to recognize the independence of the Cuban insurgents. He would not be content with the recognition of bellig erency, but would insist upon the ac knowledgment of absolute political liberty. He was satisfied that the peo ple would not be content with the course advised by the administration. Inasmuch as the Cubans for more than two years, on many battle fields, had demonstrated their valor and love of liberty, he felt that they had earned a recognition of their political liberty and that it ought to be accorded to them without further tem porizing. "If necessary." he said, "this recognition should be backed by a fleet of American vessels in Cuban waters." He expressed a belief that the owners of Spanish bonds in this country. Ameri can citizens holding property in Cuba, injured or destroyed by the insurgents, and the carrying trade of the country, which might be affected by such a step, had joined to prevent the recogni tion of Cuba's political independence. Mr. Allen expressed the belief that President McKlnley's statement in his message, that the recognition of the belligerency of the Cuban insurgents is now unwise and therefore inadmissi ble, would be a great disappointment to the members of the republican party throughout the United States. The national convention of that party had declared in favor of the independ ence of Cuba, going farther than the simple recognition of belligerency. He thought that the president was under obligations to carry out the pledge which his party had made a pledge which had been made to 73,000,000 people. At the conclusion of Mr. Allen's re marks Mr. Hoar presented a resolution expressing the regret of the senate at the news of the death of Representa tive Ashley li. Wright, of Massachu setts, aud providing for an adjourn ment as a further mark of respect, At 12:55 o'clock the resolution was adopt ed and the senate adjourned,
