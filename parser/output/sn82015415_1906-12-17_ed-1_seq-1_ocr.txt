No. 459G "Y m MAKE I Ml "THINKS THAT IF THE TERRITORY LOSES AN ADVANTAGEOUS OP PORTUNITY FOR A TRADE OF LANAI LANDS, THROUGH THE IN TERPOSITION OF THE INJUNCTION, McCANDLESS OUGHT TO BE FORCED TO REIMBURSE THE T ERRITORY. Governor Carter has not opened the tender submitted by W. M. Glffard for an exchange of land for the govern imcnts' remaining property on the Isl and of Lanal. The governor stated this morning that ho respected tho law and would show that respect by not even opening the tender until after tho matter of tho Injunction obtained by Senator L. L. McCandless, had been settled by tho courts. The governor turned the matter over to Attorney General Peters and will bo guided by tho advice of that department. "I believe," said Governor Carter this morning "that In event of the territory being forced to effect this exchange of land at a higher figure than would or dinarily havo been the case, had this Injnuction not been brought, the courts ought to hold tho people who brought this Injunction, responsible for any additional cost that a delay of tho pro posed exchange may cause tho people of this territory. Such a thing cauld be done by the courts as the laws pro vide for such a responsibility being fix ed.

YEAR AND UP. Port Street, Honolulu GETTERS PA! "I do not of course know what length of time tho option given in that tender to the government extends. It may lapse before tho Injunction matter can be settled, and If the value of the land that Is offered to the government should "bo raised I consider that McCandless should bo held responsible for this ex pense. There Is a number of pieces of land that the government Is desirous of securing. A list of such lands was posted at the office of the land commis sioner and any person desiring to make an exchange for these Lanal lands was to study the list of land desired by tho government. If he desired to offer any of that proposed for the land of the governmen on Lanal. What land has been submitted by Mr. GIffard I can not state for I have not opened the tender. "In regard to tho talk that Lanal might pass to tho Japanese for instance or to any foreign country Great Britain already owns land In this territory, the side of Captain Cook's monument at Kealakekua Bay. The Island of Lanal would be subject to the jurisdiction of our laws whoever owned It."

The judge took up some land at Olaa about two years ago and Instead of complying with the conditions of homesteadlng public land, ho failed, so Governor Carter was Informed, failed to reside on the land according to law. While Land Commissioner Pratt was at Hllo he took up this matter and decided to give Hapal another chance. But Hapal would not be good and when Pratt .arrived in Honolulu"lt was to find that Hapal had Instituted man damus proceedings to force him to give Hapal a title to the land. Governor Carter expressed hlmsell 'this morning as decidedly annoyed at the conduct of Hapal who, Instead of upholding tho laws as he Is supposed to do as a district magistrate, has started litigation against the Terri tory. There had to W considerable pressure brought to bear on the Gov ernor to secure the reappointment of Hapal. Had the present mandamui litigation been anticipated. It Is high ly probable that Hapal would not have been reappointed.
