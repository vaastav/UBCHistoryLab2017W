A L LL WIKK KEPORT OF THE ASSOCIATED 'IW The State Journal Is a nember of the Xvoolated Press and receives the full day te-rraph report ot that ryeat mm or ailatlon for the exclusive afternoon publication In lurfltn. The news Is received In The State Jour nal build!rs ovor "fires for this sole pur pose. Cm thing that makes Washington sore la that Oyster Bay should rival it in fame. . The Houston Post rise3 to observe that Mr. Roosevelt "would rather write than be president. It hag been officially decided that there Is no ice trust in Kansas City. Quite likely there is not ice in Toledo either not now. There seems to be almost as much Soubt about whether Castro and the Bhah of Persia are dead as there is about Mrs. Eddy. Will Governor Hoch say anything about prohibition and resubmission in Jils message, or not? It doesn't cost anything to gcew. The express companies don't do all the robbing. One of them was the rob bed down in Texas the othet day. to the tune of $110,000. There is c ; good thing about not having a big income. Tou don't have to worry about President Roosevelt's Income tax proposition. A baby monkey in the Peoria. 111., loo has been named Caruso. That monkey will certainly have grounds for anger when it grows up. It i3 stated that Ruef also held up the theaters in San Francisco. In most places it works the other way the theaters hold up the people. We always had a pretty fair opinion of Nebraska, but the news that it pays its supreme court justices less than Kansas does doesn't help it any. They still have Senator Bailey doing some explaining stunts down in Texas. When a man has to do that much ex plaining things look rather serious. George W. Hanna has given his for mal consent to mergi'ng the Populist party with the Republican. but George W. Wiley is still hanging back. It may be necessary for Taft to go out and sit on the lid in San Francisco yet. If so, he should make sure there are r.o earthquakes lying around loose. Now '"iat President Roosevelt has given the Japs a fine send-off, let us ee if they live up to it bv overlook ing thi3 little affair out at San Fran cisco. For some reason the president failed !n his message to recommend that all Christmas presents be bought early. Otherwise the good recommendations were pretty well covered. The president has given congress a lot of things to think about during its next vacation, for it probably won't get through with more than a third of the work the president has outlined. Speaking of fame, an exchange re fers to the iate Marcus Tullius Cicero As the Albert J. Beveridge of Rome, al though so far as is known Mr. Cicero wrote nothing whatever about "The Russian Advance." After reading his income tax recom mendation Mr. Bryan very naturally Charges the president with stealing come more of his clothes. And this is the time of year when Mr. Bryan needs oil his clothes, too. Those California congressmen who have been violent In their opposition to the Japanese will naturally oppose the proposition to allow the Japs to be come citizen. The Japanese vote wouldn't do a thing to them. The governor of Arkansaw an nounces that when he gets to the United States senate he will start something. The governor of Wiscon etn did not advertise beforehand that he would start something when he got there, but he really did start a whole avalanche. If It is right for a railroad to con fiscate coal that does not belong to it in case of emergency, why is it not also rip-ht for a community that is suf fering for want of fuel to do the same thing? A number of Kansas towns have been unable to see '.he difference. A London scientist thinks that the Korth Pole will be located '-- 'he vi cinity of Indianapolis In a couple of thousand years. Hasn't the London telentist got the time rather long? It won't take Fairbanks that long to re duce the temperature of Indianapolis. It is proposed that a big crowd of Kar.sans shall go to Galveston to in stall tha silver service which the Btate is to give to the battleship Kansas, but unless it can be brought abou before this year's passes expire, it Is feared that the "crowd" will consist largely of railroad employes whose passes are not affected by mere laws. THE TJtEASOlY 

SHORTAGE. The manly action of F. E. Grimes, ex state treasurer, in paying to the state $3,281.25 in settlement of the shortages in the state school fund charged against his administration, probably closes the incident from a legal standpoint. The amount paid by Mr. Grimes is the sum which he has agreed with the attorney general can be enforced against him, and his refunding It ends the necessity for a civil action, while the statute of limitations has precluded any criminal action in the matter. The sum .paid over by Mr. Grimes, together with that advanced to C. R. Richey, $783.00, to make good another Item of the same kind several months ago, amounts to more than Mr. Grimes' salary as state treasurer during the en tire time he held the office. Naturally this is a big sum for a man in Mr. Grimes' circumstances to pay, but he does it. he says, simply because he feels that the state has this claim against him and he desires more than anything etee to protect his name. Few people will believe that Frank Grimes took any of the money that is missing from the state treasury, but he makes no allegations in his state ment as to who did take it. Yet there Is no doubt that a large sum was taken that belonged to the state. It is un fortunate that this matter was not cleared up, not only In order that the guilty might be punished, but that the innocent might be entirely cleared from blame. An opportunity to do this was af forded in the case of the Garden City shortage, but when the statute of limi tations was allowed to run on that also without action, the opportunity passed by. Mr. Grimes says he is the victim of the carelessness, mistakes and unfaith fulness of others. It is extremely un fortunate for him that he is not in a position to prove who these "others" are. The refunding of practically his entire salary for the .four years he was In office is an extremely serious mat er for Mr. Grimes financially, to say nothing of the moral aspect of the case. Could Mr. Grimes show who was guilty of the theft he might recover this large sum. More than that, he would render an Important service to public morals, which is the thing in which the peo ple are deeply interested. DEADLY HOT WATER. The fatal scalding of a little child in Parkdale Saturday recalls once more that the deadly tub of hot water is one of the greatest enemies of childhood except in this particular Instance it was a dishpan. Almost every week some of the country papers of Kansas contain an account cf a dreadful accident of this nature. Sometimes the child falls into (he scalding flood, but not infrequently It happens that the washing machine Is the fatal agent. The machine is filled with hot water and the little child, unobserved by the mother, creeps up and pulls out the plug, and the scalding liquid pours out on it. The exchange editor on every news paper sees accounts of dozens of acci dents of this nature, and always some Innocent little one, the pride and joy of its parents, is the vicitm. It is one of the most terrible of deaths, entailing suffering indescribable. Where there are small children too great care can not be taken in handling scalding water. Pound the plug in the washer so tightly that it can not pos sibly be pulled out by little hands, and do not under any circumstances leave a tub of the scalding fluid where a baby may plunge into it. Hot water is a splendid thing in its place, and its places are legion, but it takes a very little of it sometimes to bring terrible suffering and anguish. SHALL IT RE CHANGED? Up at Des Moines a convention has been in session to consider the idea of electing Ignited States senators by di rect vote of the people and the out come of that convention was expressed in this resolution: "That while this convention would much prefer that congress should sub mit to the several states a proposed amendment to the constitution for the election of senators b;- direct vote of the people, so that the states might pass upon it as a single question, yet inasmuch as the senate persistently re fuses to submit such amendment. It therefore earnestly recommends that the legislatures of the several states do. in pursuance of Article IV of the constitution of the United States, make application to the congress to call a convention for the purpose of propos ing amendments to the constitution of the United States." Naturally most of the present mem bers of the United States senate do not desire the proposed amendment, for It would retire many of them to private life. There are other matters in the constitution which some able men think need fixing, and so the conven tion is proposed to discuss all of them and to recommend such amendments as seem best. Now the United States constitution is a wonderful document. That such a code of rules should have been framed when this nation was only an infant rind that It should have done duty through all these years is little short of marvellous. The constitution ought pot to be greatly changed unless there are weighty reasons for suc-h change, but the nation has now grown to such an extent that a number cf changes may be advisable. The problems of gov ernment today were undreamed of when our constitution was written. It Is a difficult matter to amend the constitution, and it Is right that it should be. Therefore, a convention to discuss the proposed amendments and to formulate in proper form such as seem desirable might be a pood thing. The Washington Star takes this view of it. It says: "Well, why not a constitutional con vention? What but good could come of it? The debates In themselves would be of the greatest value. To such a body none but men of recog nized learning in the law and govern ment would be sent, and from their conferences and discussions everybody would be able to extract something of value. The constitution as it stands has occasioned no end of disputes. Great lawyers and great publicists have all along been found on either side of the line. We have had from the beginning, and have now. a strict construction school and a liberal con struction school, and all sorts of mean ings have been read into, and then read out of, the more Important provi sions of the instrument. "But more vital than this is the fact that things have changed so much with us in the past fifty years. In many particulars we have a new country. In that time we have fought two wars. one of them for the preservation of the government Itself, and from both inherited new problems of the highest Importance. The states were welded together by the Civil war, and since then we have been operating largely on centralized principles, while as a result of the war with Spain we have acquired territory far from our base, and calling for new wrinkles in the exercise of both executive and legis lative functions. "We are not going backward in our national life, and we cannot stand still. Forward is the law of a vigorous bodv politic, and if the national chart needs substantial revision always preserv ing of course the principles of liberty and equality before the law revision should be made. At any rate, why not formally and officially discuss the whole subject?" 

JOURNAL ENTRIES This department ; has ' considerable doubt about these alleged San Fran cisco grafters after all. There Is four million dollars still unspent in the re lief fund. Now that the legislature is about to meet, it is surprising that somebody doesn't refer to him as "Hon. S. Glaus." Nearly everybody else is Hon."ed. . The Midwinter Fair won't be the only show in Topeka next month. There will be a fine displa" of alleged statesmanship on exhibition at the state house. Peary says if you want rabbits to taste good you want to live on dog meat awhile. This department has no ambition to accuire a taste for rabbit. S So far as we are ci tlcerned the president need not have taken three columns to tell why he fired Bellamy Storer. This department would, have considered his reasons just n valid if he had given them in three sticks. 

JAYHAWKER JOTS The Logan Republican remarks that it has to be an ornery-looking plug that won't bring $100 these days. The little town of RobinFon has moved up to the head of the procession. It has passed an ordinance prohibiting charivaris. Some people pay a good deal for ex perience. A Brown county farmer sold his farm for $100 an acre and then gave the purchaser $1,000 to trade back. Editor Palmer, of Jewell, remarked that "the old song about December be ing as pleasant as May must have or iginated In Kansas." And the next day the cold wave came. A Seneca man who once claimed he could drink it or let It alone, commit ted suicide last veek. He proved he could let it alone, but it required ex treme measures to do it. Jewell Republican: If you want to put in a bid on the Panama canal job. kindly send along your certified check for $200, COO to assure Uncle Sam that you are not monkeying with him. You must also assure him that you have an avauaDie working capital of $5,000,000, and provide a bond of $3,000,000. If the contractor falls to complete the woik within the time specified he will forfeit $100,000 per month for each month's delay. If the work is cnmnlp- ted in less than the specified time he will be paid a premium of $100,000 per month. We would like to see some of our Jewell City contractors working under some such regulations. They w ould have to change their gait or come out a million dollars behind. Confession by A. Croaker in the Hol ton Recorder: I am the fortunate, or unfoitunate as the case may be, father of some children who have taken a col lege course, and imbibed a predilection for college athletics and sports. They think they have a powerful good Joke on me when they catch me reading or quoting the Eporting news in the daily paper. It does not seem to satisfy them or do any good to argue that to com bat evil of any kind successfully one has to get and keep posted as to the prevalence and effect of the evil. 1 some times think they are exceedingly obtuse on matters where their preju dices are involved. The sober logical fact is, however, that most people, pos sibly myself Included, have a strain of the wild in them inherited, no doubt, from our savage ancestors who used to dress in skins of animals and live ir; caves and dugouts and carry war clubs and were ready, willing and anxi ous at all times to fight their enemies to the death. Evidently nearly 2 000 years of Christian civilization has not entirely eradicated the wild and brutal in us. This no doubt is why I hardly ever miss reading the sporting pages of the papers and enjoy it too. The respon sibility rests with my savage ancestry away back in the dim savage past and with the well established law of heredity which seems to defy civiliza tion and Christianity. I am half in clined sometimes to throw up my hands, give up the contest and ac knowledge myself bested, and yet this same strain of belligerent blood pro tests against acknowledging defeat What is a fellow to do? REFLECTIONS OF A BACHELOR. From the New York Press. "Can't afford it" is a poor excuse. Anyway, a man in jail escapes building a house. Most of our lunatic asylums are filled with critics. If no man has ever kissed a girl you must not believe her. A man who harps on one string isn't necessarily high strung. It's difficult for a man to keep Cool when he is between two fires. Truth isn't always a thing of beauty, but It Isn't the truth's fault. The shadow of suspicion often re sults from the casting of reflections. When political grafters fall out, hon est newspaper men get a lot of copy. There's no use at ail in being so mighty good that it makes everybody hate you. A girl can fool a man about every thing except what she doesn't know about athletics. If people weren't so intent on picking out soft spots to land on they wouldn't fall down so much. The girl who is chummy with her father and brothers hasn't much to fear from other men. Bad weather often proves a blessing In disguise by affording people some thins to talk about. i KANSAS COMMENT LOOKING BACKWARD. In taIlng an Inventory for the year 1906, one Is too apt to view all things from the standpoint of his own per sonal accomplishments that Is, what it has meant to him. That is entirely too narrow a view. During- the year what have you dene to contribute to the happiness and lighten the burdens me companion of your joys and sorrows? Have you brightened the pathway o? the children of the house hold? Have you helped In the allevia tion of suffering in your community? Have you assisted the poor and needy? H-ive you extended svmpathy to the bereavea? Have you done those little things from day to dav that mean so much to those about vou? If not, though you have made your thousands and have it in bank, though vou have entertained lavishly, though you have availed yourself of everv possible per sonal comfort, the vear will show a balance on the wrons side of the ledger and in your reflective moments you will realize that vou have not even iXv V em?a livinS up to life's truest ideals. Kingman Leader. SOME PLANS. A story comes out or Topeka to the effect that the friends of Charles Curtis are discussing a plan by which it is expected that Curtis will be elected senator. The Idea is not new, but it has been successfully worked in other similar contests. The plan is to organ ize a "stampede" at the right moment in the balloting. On the theory that "the best laid plans of mice and men aft gang aglee." it is not altogether im probable that the plans to "scare" the legislature into electing Curtis as Unit ed States senator may also fail. We do not beiieve that the people of Kansas are for Curtis for senator and his elec tion by trickery or otherwise will be a public disaster. Concordia Blade. HIGHER UP. Governor Hoch and his cabinet pro pose to give the people of Kansas a practical exemplification of the real thing in law enforcement, if all the of fending mayors lose their jobs. The only reason it hasn't been done before was that nobody thought there was any other way than to go after the Jointist. The new plan is to go higher up and make the man behind sweat. Stockton Record. GOT THEM SCARED. One thing 13 certain, no governor of Kansas has scared the jolntists so fre quently or so effectively as Governor Hoch has done. That isn't oil, either he has scared a lot of county and city officials as well. The prohibitionists have a great argument in favor of their position just now. If the mere threat of law enforcement shuts up the Jointu, they wonder what the real action would do. Concordia Kansan. UP ORDOWN? The Kansas City papers note that whisky Is going up. Possibly, in Mis souri, but out this way we notice that it is still going down and in the same old way. Osborne Farmer. SCHMIT2! AND REUF. It i.i said that Mayor Schmitz and Boss Reuf, under indictment in San Francisco, have parted company. This will not change the universal opinion, however, that they should hang to gether. Salina Journal. FROM OTHER PENS HYSTERIA IN CONGRESSMEN. California's delegation in congress Is in danger of discrediting Itself at home, by its extravagant criticism of that part of the president's message relating to the Japanese school question. San Francisco is not the state of California. And the "wild frenzy of indignation" patriotically displayed by our congress men, three thousand miles away, finds few echoes among their constituents at home, unless it be in Mr. Kahn's and Mr. Knowland's districts. These gentlemen, whose daily walks are in the shadow of our nation's capi tol. should, of all men, remember that thev are citizens of the United States, as well as of California, and that they are not plenipotentiaries to a foreign government, but servants of a whole people, owing loyalty to a nation, as well as to a state. Mr. Roosevelt, In addressing congress, speaks as the president of our country, not as an individual, and as one charged with the highest and gravest responsibili ties. Among these Is the maintenance of our treaty obligations, and the avoid ance of complications which might re sult in war. None knows better than he what dangers may threaten our peace. His utterances are clothed with authority, and in matters of such im port, beyond all others, he should have the loyal support of congress and the people. What are San Fran cisco's local squabbles, as compared with the most vital interests of the nation ? ... Behind the president, in his attitude, is the highest law in the land, the con stitution of the United States. In the most emphatic language, it makes our foreign treaties the supreme law, above anything that congress could do, superior to anything that states or cities have the right to do. This au thority was expressly delegated to the treatv making power of the govern ment the president and the senate. Japan knows this. We can not say to Japan that the federal government has not power to interfere In a state or municipality, to obtain her treaty rights. She can point to the article and section of our constitution which expressly makes it the duty of the fed eral government to do so. We have hoped San Francisco would find a way to settle the question, with out embroiling the whole country. She has an undoubted right to provide sep arate school for the Japanese, provided this is done, not by way of discrimina tion, but to give greater efficiency to the educational system. And she has a right to bar grown men from her primary and grammar schools. We must approve and sympathize with the objections to admitting adult Japanese, or any other Japanese, to the classes and school rooms intended for children of tender and impressionable age. A regulation limiting the age of pupils in attendance would be bot hlegal and justifiable. But it must not be dis criminative. We believe San Francisco will find a way out of the difficulty, and Ivope she will do so without federal inter vention. That the latter will be forth coming, however, unlegs the proper steps are taken to make such a de plorable course unnecessary, is certain. Meantime, stop this silly hullabaloo about insults to the state of California. Los Angeles News. THE 

CONSUMERS PAY. We could all look on with a good deal of complacerrey at the contest be tween the steel trust and the beef trust were It not for the feeling of ap prehension that the loser will take up a general "collection" to defray the costs. Indlapolla News. THE BROKEN NOSE. We've got a baby. Since It came There's not a single thing the same. I act Just like I did before. But no one loves me any more. I guess I d better run away. I might as well, for if I stay vVho'll know or care? Perhaps a year Will pass before they ever hear. 1 11 take the things I like tlie best. My Sunday tie, my velvet vest. The spotted eggs and bluebird's nest. The autumn leaves that mother pressed The rabbit skin that father dressed. All these I'll take and go out west. I ought to start, but O, the sky Is dark today and very high! Still, after all, I guess I'll wait For father by the garden gate. He'll mavbe much mv hnlr nnd sav: "Well, well, my boy! How goes the day? iuu re oig enough to make it pay. O dear! I wish he'd come, though he May never even notice me And yet I guess I'll wait and see. American Magazine. Making Money Out of a Waste-Pile. The people of Chicago are lucky, says Wm. Hard In the Technical vv orid Magazine for December. Wit ness the rock heap which was oequeathed to them by the con tractors who dug the Chicago drainage canal. But what could be a harder stroke of bad luck than to be encumbered with a heterogeneous scrap pile of some fifty million cubic yards of dirt and stone? How to rid themselves of this monster incubus without depleting the city treasury, would be a question for the citizens to decide at any other time. But this is just the point where luck came to the rescue. The people of Chicago are lucky be cause they dug their big ditch at the psychological moment. Just as the concrete age is being ushered in. and building contractors have visions of mountains of crushed stone and rivers or cement, the people of Chicago drop onto the market with twenty-three minion cubic vards of available rock But even millions of cubic yards of rocK couia not break the Chicago raitn in concrete, and the big con tractor, John M. Ewen. jumped under the market with the highest bid for onicago s backyard scrap pile. At the present price of crushed stone in Chi cago, the waste heap will sell for as much as it cost to dig the whole drainage canal. In addition to selling the crushed stone, concrete blocks are to be made right alons the banks of the canal and shipped to market, Just as bricks are at present. Mr. Ewen will install half a million dollars' worth of ma chinery, which will crush the stone and make it into concrete blocks. The actual cost of the drainage canal did not exceed 36 million dollars, and Mr. Ewen believes that the crushed stone and cement blocks will sell for at least that amount. Thus will a new Indus try be established, and the people of Chicago reimbursed for their trouble in digging their big canal. Where Some Writers Fall. In the Editor's Study in Harper's for December, Mr. Alden gives his opinion that the chief fault to be guarded against in writing is the lack of spon taneity. "The most frequent flefect in fiction submitted for magazine use, and, we might add, in most of the fiction that somehow gets published in book form, is its lack of spontaneity in construction and expression. The writer of this man ufactured fiction has a certain precalcu- lated effect in view, with reference to which he ambitiously contrives every incident and situation of his story. The harder he tries the more surely he fails of any genuine appeal to his readers. If he disguises his labor by a facile mas tery of dramatic material and expres sion, he may succeed in reaching crude sensibilities and, because of his lower aim, may outsell his betters. The mul titude is easily ca ivated by splendid artifice, which, in exceptional instances, has compelled the admiration of even the judicious. We shall find, however, upon close examination, thaL in such in stances the writer has not by his stren uous effort wholly closed the door against all spontaneity. Pee came very near to the exclusion in his short stor ies of such genius as was in him; but because he was by temperament a poet, a lover therefore of haunting melody and easily the creator of pregnant at mospheres, he could not completely shut himself out of his fiction. In our day polite literature must appeal to human sympathies, and the writer's fertility of Invention is of little service." An Infernal Drink. A diverting Joke was played on For mer Prime Minister Balfour on the first St. Patrick's day of his tenure of the Irish chief secretaryship. A cigar box, delivered to him at the house of commons, contained a bunch of sham rocks, "From a sincere Irish admirer." But, to the terror of his secretaries, the box was also fund to contain a wicked looking steel spring, covered with a queer white compound. A chemical expert was called for. and he examined the "infernal machine" everybody momentarily expecting an explosion. The puzzled chemist, venturing to put a narticle of the compound on his tongue, found that it was simply su gar, impregnated with lemon. He then turned the box upside down, and out rolled a rusty corkscrew, a spiral spring, and an old nutmeg-grater. There was also a scrap of paper in scribed: "Buy the whiskey yourself; you can then concoct the famous lem onade of Ballyhooley, and drink to Ouid Ireland." The Bohemian.
