PRICE FIVE CENTS FOR WAR ON AUSTRIA ONLY WHEN IT IS JUST AUSTRIANS WILL BE INITIAL STEP Scores of Enemy Suspects Will Be Detained After War Declaration. ANTICIPATING MOVE, EXODUS HAS STARTED Subjects of Dual Monarchy in America Will Be Obliged to Register. Washington, Dec. 4.—Scores ot Austro-Hungarian subjects, suspected of being enemy agents In this country, will be arrested within a few hours after a declaration of war against Austria. Many of these men have been under surveillance by department of justice agents for months, but have not been taken into custody because of lack of definite evidence against them. When congress adopts President Wilson's recommendation that a state of war against Austria-Hungary be declared, unnaturalized subjects of the dual monarchy automatically will become enemy aliens and be subject to summary arrest and internment. Information Already Gathered. For months government agents have been gathering information on the hostile activities of Austrians, who were not subject to the. restrictions Imposed on unnaturalized Germans, by the state of war with Germany and those caught in illegal acts were ar rested and tried under the usual crim inal statutes. Many others were free to travel and obtain information valu able to America's enemies, however, while keeping their conduct technically within the law. Government investigators recently reported an exodus of educated Aus trians from the United States and it is believed they fled in anticipation of a formal declaration of war against their country. Among them were known to be men who had been con nected with hostile interests. Conse quently a declaration of war at this time would be too late to permit the apprehension of some of the most dangerous leaders of the enemy espi onage system. Nearly a million Austrian subjects in the United States would be affected by a declaration of war, for they would immediately become amenable to the president's recent order requiring ene my aliens to register with public authorities forbidding them to travel Without special permit, and barring them from waterfronts, warehouses and terminals. All Must Register. Regulations to put into effect the enemy alien registration will be Issued within a few days by the department of justice and applied at first only to eastern cities, where, the police will conduct the registration, recording de tailed information concerning each registrant. The task will he . three times greater than when planned only for Germans. Officials realize that most Austro-Hungarians In this coun try are harmless, and a great propor tion particularly of Hungarian, Bohe mian and Slavic elements are actually pro-ally. Consequently, careful con sideration will *be shown in adminis tering the enemy alien regulations. Department of justice officials were pleased today over the. preisdent's recommendation for legislation to ex tend enemy alien restrictions to wom en, some, of whom are suspected of being clever aids to the German espi onage system, and to authorize more drastic punishment for active alien enemies, such as penitentiary impris onment and hard labor. 

SANTA CLAUS GETS TO SAMMEES EARLY Thousands of Bags of Mail Reach France. With the American Army in France. Dec. 4.—By the Associated Press. — Christmas mail for the troops began arriving today in the American zone. In one town alone 1,000 sacks were de livered.

The American postoffices have made every plan to keep the mails moving from them to the positions where the addressees are quartered. Many of the offices arc small and it is feared un less they are constantly kept cleared, roongestion may result from the heavy phristmas mail that is expected. a NEW cm WRITTEN IN BERMAN BRUTALITY 'London, Dec. 4.—The British steamer Apapa has been tor pedoed and sunk, according to the morning papers.

VON HIMBENBURG CANNOT SHATTER GRIP Of BRITISH Haig Believes Present Lull at Cambrai Precedes New Hun Effort. ATTACKS OF GERMANS ARE COSTLY IN MEN Dense Waves of Enemy Troops Mowed Down by Merciless Briton Fire. With the British Army in France, Dec. 4. By the Associated Press. — The Germans up to noon today had not renewed their attempts of yesterday to smash the British front south of Mar coing, but it seems improbable that the enemy will allow matters to remain as they now are. The situation, therefore, is still one that cannot lie dismissed lightly in view of the heavy concentration of guns and troops which Von llinden liurg has brought to bear on this line. There has been no change in the re spective positions of the opposing night. Exhaustion of reorganizing his have undoubtedly to pause for a forces since last and the necessity depleted ranks forced the enemy breathing spell. Playing for Big Stakes. The ground won by the Germans yesterday could in no wise compensate for the shambles caused by Von Hin denburg's disregard for the lives of his men. But it must be borne in mind that he was playing for vastly bigger stakes than have yet been won. In ilia latest attacks there were un doubtedly tremendous efforts to break through, with great possibilities of a drive out into the open such as lie en gineered in Italy. The situation today was much easier for the British. Yesterday was admit tedly a rather anxious one. but abun dant reinforcements arrived. The cheeking of the Germans' incessant massed attacks was due only to the gallantry of the British soldiers, who did not yield before fierce assaults by greatly superior numbers. Masses Are Slaughtered. In their stupendous efforts against La Vacquerie, the Germans swept for ward in dense waves with absolutely no concealment and were slaughtered. During the afternoon they uelivered a very heavy attack 'also west of Mas nieres and succeeded in smashing through the British line, but an im mediate counter attack forced them to fall back. The open fighting which has devel oped along the new battle front lias created an entirely new situation, which holds out many possibilities und now, more than ever, involves the question of generalship, which may de cide the issue. Have Not Launched New Italian Attack. As yet the anticipated •renewal by the Austro-Germans of their infantry attacks on a large seule against the Italians on the Venetian front lias not materialized. The enemy artillery, however, continues active from the Asiago plateau eastward toward the headwaters of the Piave river. On the Trentlno front the enemy has essayed an attack which was repulsed. Along tlie Piave valley the Italians again have dispersed Austrian bodies con centrating for attacks. The battle between the Turks and the British in Palestine for tlie posses sion of Jerusalem has not begun. Taken all in al! there is no change in the sit uation in this region, although General Allenliy's forces have carried out smull offensives in the nature of raids and killed or captured the occupants of Turkish trenches.

PRESIDENT WILSON'S MESSAGE TO WORLD Gentlemen of Congress: Right months have r4npsc<! since 1 last had the honor of addressing you. They have been months crowded with events of immense and grave signifi cance for us. 1 s«mll not undertake to detail or even to summarize those events. The practical particulars of the part we have played in that will he laid before you In reports of the executive departments. 1 shall dis cuss only our present outlook upon these vast affairs, our present duties and immediate means of accomplish ing the objects we shall hold always In view. I shall not go back to debate the causes of the war. The Intolerable wrongs done and planned against ns by the sinister masters of Germany have long since become too grossly obvious and odious to every true American to need to lie rehearsed. But I shall ask you to consider again and with very grave scrutiny our objec tives and the measures by which we mean to attain them. Our object Is. of course, to win the war and we shall not slacken or suffer ourselves to be diverted until It is von. But it Is the question of when shall we con sider the war won? From one point of view' It is not necessary to broach this fundamental matter. t do not doubt that the American people know what the war is about and what sort of an outcome they will regard as a realization of their purpose in II. As a nation we are united In spirit and intention. I pay little heed to those who tell me otherwise. I hear voices of dissent. Who does not? I hear criticism and clamor of the noisy, thoughtless and troublesome. I also see men here and there fling them selves in Impotent disloyalty against the calm, indomitable power of the nation. I hear men debate peace who understand neither its nature nor the way in which, we may attain it. But 1 know that none of these speaks for the nation. They do not touch the heart of anything. They may safely be left to strut theii uneasy hour and be for gotten. 

PLAIN SPEECH NEEDED I believe that it is necessary to say ! plainly that we here at the seat of I action consider the war to be for and ; w'hnt part we mean to play in the set - I tlement of its searching Issues. We are the spokesmen of the Amer- I lean people, and they have a right to know whether their purpose Is ours. They desire peace by the overcom ing of evil, by the defeat once for all of the sinister forces that interrupt Peace and render it impossible, and they wish to know how closely our thought runs with theirs and what ac tion we propose. They are im patient with those who desire peuce by any sort of compro mise. They are deeply and indignant ly impatient with these, hut they will he equally Impatient with us If we do not make it plain to them what our objectives are and what we are plan ning for in seeking to make conquest of peace by arms. I believe that I speak for them when I say two things: First, that this intolerable thing of which the masters of Germany have shown us the face, this menace of combined in trigne and force which we now sec so clearly as the German power, a thing without conscience or honor or capacity for peace, must be crushed, and If it bo not utterly brought to an end. at least shut out from the friendly intercourse of the nations: and, second, that when this thing and Its power are indeed defeated and the time comes that we can discuss peace—when the German people have spokesmen whose word we can be lieve and when those spokesmen are ready in tlie name of their people to accept the common judgment of the nations as to whal shall he the basis of law and of covenant for tho life of the world—we shall Ih- glad to pay the full price for peace, and pay it trustingly. We know what the price will be. It will be full and impar tial justice. Justice done at every point and to all the nations. The final settlement must affect our enemies as well as our friends. VOICES OF HUMANITY. You catch, with me, tho voices of humanity that are in the air. they grow morn audible, more articulate, more persuasive, and they come of men, they Insist that war shall not end in vindictive action of any kind; that no nation or people shall be robbed or crushed by tho irresponsible rulers of a single country who have themselves done deeply wrong. It is the thought that has been expressed in the formula, "No annexations, no contribution, no punitive indemni ties." Just because this crude for mula expresses the Instinctive judgment as to right of plain men everywhere, it has been made diligent use of by the masters of German intrigue to lead the people of Russia astray, the people of every country their agents I could reach, in ordrr that a promu - J turc peace might be brought about be . fore autocracy has been taught Its I final and convincing lesson and the people ol tlie world put in control of their own destinies. RIGHT USE FOR IT. Bui the fact that a wrong use lias been made of a just Idea Is no rea son why a right use should not be made of it. It ought to be brought under the patronage of Its real friends. 1-et it be said again that au tocracy must first be shown the ut ter futility of its claims to power of leadership In the modern wqrld. It Is impossible to apply any standard of justice so long as such forces are uncheeked and undefeated as the pres ent masters of Germany command. Not I until that has been done can right he set up as arbiter and peace-maker among the nations. But when that has been done—as, God willing, it as suredly will lie—we shall at last be free to do an uni rcccdented thing, and this is the time to avow our pur pose to do It. We shall be free to hum pence on generosity and justice to the exclusion of all selfish claims i ven on tlie part of victors. Let there be no misunderstanding. Our past and immediate task is to win the war and nothing shall turn us aside from it until it.is accomplished. Every power and resource we possess, whether of men, of money, or of ma terials, is being devoted, and will con tinue to be devoted, to that purpose until it is achieved. We shall regard the war as won only when the German people say to us, through their properly-accredited representative, that they are ready to admit to a settlement based upon justice and reparation of wrongs their rulers have done. They have done wrong to Belgium, which must he re paired. They have established a pow er over other lands and peoples than their own- over Ute great empire of Austria-Hungary, over hitherto free Balkan states, over Turkey, and within Asia—which must be relinquished. TO REMEDY WRONG. Germany's success by skill, by in dustry, by enterprise, we did not grudge or oppose, but admired rather. She had built up for herself i real empire of trade and seeurPd by the peace of the world. We were content to abide the rivalries of muniifact tirera, science and commerce that were in volved for us In lier success and stand or fall as we had or did not have the brains and the initiative'to surpass. But at tlie moment when she had conspicuously won her triumphs of peace she threw them away to estab lish in their stead what the world will no longer permit to be established, military and political domination by arms, by which to oust where she could not excel the rivals she most feared and hated. The peace we make must remedy that wrong. It must deliver the once fair lands and happy people of Belgium and north ern France from the Prussian conquest and the Prussian menace, but it must also deliver the peoples of Austria Hungary, the peoples of the Balkans and the people of Turkey, alike in Eu rope and Asia, from the impudent and alien domination of the Prussian mili tary and commercial autocracy. FREEDOM FOR AUSTRIA We. owe It, however, to ourselves to say that we do not wish in any way to impair or to rearrange tlie Austro Hungarian empire. It Is no affair of ours what they do with their own life, either industrially or politically. We do not purpose or desire to dictate to them in any way. We only desire to see that their affairs are left In their own hands, in all matters, great nr small. We shall hope to seetire for the peoples of the Balkans peninsula and for the people of Turkish empire the right and opportunity to make their own lives safe, their own for tunes secure against oppression or in justice and from tlie dictation of for eign court or parties. And our atti tude and purpose with regard to Ger many herself are of a like kind. Wo intend no worng against the German empire, no interference with Inter national affairs. We should deem either one or the other injustifiable, absolutely contrary to tho policies we have professed to live and to hold most sacred throughout our life as a nation. TO FREE GERMANS. Tito people of Germany are being told by the men whom they now per mit to deceive them and to aet as their masters, that they are fighting for the very life and existence of their Mmpire, a war of desperate self-de fense against deliberate aggression. Nothing could be more grossly or wantonly false, and we must seek by the utmost condor to our real aims to convince them of its falseness. We are. In fact, fighting for their emanci pation from fear, from the fear of un just attack by neighbors, or rivals, or schemers after world empire. No one is threatening the existence or the peacefulness of the German em pire, The worst that can happen to the detriment of tlie German people is this, that if they should still, after the war. continue to he obliged to live (Contlnued on Page Five.)

The ' war will be deemed won, Washington, Doc. 4.— A definite statement to the world of America's war aims and of the bans upon which peace will be considered, was made today by President Wilson in an address to congress in which he urged immediate declaration ot a state of war between the United States and Austria-Hun gary—Germany's vassal and tool. As to Turkey and Bulgaria—also tools of the enemy—he counselled delay because "they do not yet stand in the direct path of our necessary action." To wm the war, the president declared in emphatic and ringing tones. Is the immediate and unalterable task ahead.
