Evans has been retained by the Commercial club of Dakota City, Neb., to combat the action of the Chicago. St. Paul, Min neapolis and Omaha railroad in abol ishing train stops at Dakota City, on the Norfolk branch line. A protest signed by residents or the town will be filed with the Nebraska state rail road commission at once and Judge Evans will petition the commission ers for an immediate hearing. It is probable that Judge Evans will act in concert with City Attorney Ward Evans, of South Sioux City, who will file a similar protest in behalf of the city council of that place. The city council will frame its protest at a meeting to be held next Tuesday evening.... Organization of a com pany to take over the operation of the Combination bridge probably will take place soon after the first of the year, according to W. L. Selby, 

ROSS Nebraska of Omaha, who purchased the struc ture at a forced sale several months ago. At the present time the title of the entire holdings of the old Combination Bridge comyany is vest ed in Mr. Selby. The taking over of the property by a corporation will indicate whether the bridge will con tinue to be a private enterprise or bo controlled by the Burlington, Union Pacific or some other railroad. According to the articles of incor poration of the Combination Bridge company the annual meeting of the stockholders should have been held in October, but owing to the com plications arising from the sale was passed. It was stated yesterday by former attorneys of the bridge com pany that the old corporation had ceased to exist and that nothing will be done until Mr. Selby has formed a new one. The business of tht company continues to be managed by F. L. Eaton, who was president of the old company. Ponca Journal: Ponca hu school's claim to thechampionvpof northeast Nebraska were nracica.ly assured when they defeated the fast Homer team here Saturday. Out of five games played they have won 4 and tied 1. At 3 o'clock Homer wus on the field and ready to play. Ponca won the toss and Homer kicked to them, defending the west goal. Ponca ad vanced the ball to the middle of the field where they lost it&io Homer on the fourth down, fiomer could make no appreciable gain and the ball was Ponca's on the 35-yard line. The playing in the first quarter was the luke warm variety neither team being able to make a good gain. In the second quarter Ponca played real ball and by oft" tackle runs took ball to Homer's five yard line. Hines scored a touch down on a line plunge, Adams kicked goal. In the next five minutes Homer at tempted a pass but Bray intercepted it carrying it across for a second touch down. Adams missed goal. Homer was penalized for slugging and offside. Heydon was called through the line on a shift play and. a third touch down was counted tor the Indians. Adams again kicked goal. In the second half, Homer came back and held the Indians to only one touch down. It was this .quarter that Homer threatened to cross Ponca's goal for the first time this year, but the player was tack led 10 yards from the goal, loosing the ball on fumble. Ponca carried it to within 10 yards of Homer's goal but a penalty for slugging took the gain away and the game ended 27 to 0 with the "Indians" holding the long end. The team as a whole did excellent work and in spite of the two weeks rest without practice proved their worth and ability to stage a come back. By reason of no defeat and comparative scores Ponca can rightly lay claim to the championship of northeast Nebraska. The time of quarters was 10-12-10-12. Referee, Peterson, P.

He said that one-half of the damage done across the xiver by the late storm had not 'yet been told. In Emerson township alone, Mr. Maher says, the damage will amount to thousands, of dollars. Not only were large numbers of fruit trees ruined by the sleet which clung to the limbs and broke them off, but nearly every cottonwood and willow of respecta ble size in the township was split by the weight of the ice. 

CIGIESSIONAL ,CuMMTTEE BEGINS RAILWAY INQUIRY Proposed by President to Bet ter Condition of Carriers, MAY CHANGE PRESENT SYSTEM Official of Roadi Prepartd to Advocate Federal incorporation, Supervision of Securities and Extension of Authority of Interstate Commerce Commission. Washington, Nov. 20. Ten members of Congress, five Senators and live members of the House of Representa tives, began here today an Inquiry Into the subject of public contr "m BU" pervlslon of railroads that nXy lead to tho revolutionizing of the whole scheme of governmental regulation of the coun try's transportation lines. Incidentally the committee Is to loo'? Into the ques tlon of government o nershlp of rail ways, telephono and telegraph lines and express companies. Tho members of tho commttteo which will conduct this Important In vestigation are Senator Newlands of Nevada, chairman; Senators Itoblnson of Arkansas, Underwood of Alabama, Cummins of Iown and Brandegeo of Connecticut, and Representatives Ad amsou of Georgia, Sims of Tennessee, Cullop of Indiana, Each of "Wisconsin and Hamilton of Michigan. The in quiry was recommended by President Wilson in his message to Congress In December of last year. He described ob its purpose to determine what could bo done "for bettering the conditions under which tho railroads are operated and for making them more useful serv ants of the country as a whole." Prominent Men as Witnesses. In order to obtain the views of all Interests affected by the operations of tho transportation lines the committee has invited prominent shippers, bank ers, representatives of commercial or ganizations, railway executives, econo mists and others to appear before them. The flr'it to be heard are railroad commissioners of various elates who began their evidence today. Their testimony is directed chleily to oppos ing nny enlargement of tho federal authority over commerce that would detract from the powers now exercised by state bodies. They will bo followed shortly by ofllclals of railway labor organizations who are expected to reg ister their opposition to tho increase of governmental authority over wages and conditions of labor. Chief interest in tl6 hearings cen ters in tho proposals that will bo put forward by representatives of the rail roads, for It is reported that they will advocate an extension of federal au thority over rates and securities to the practical exclusion of Btate control of theso matters. It is, understood also that they will go on record In favor of fed cral incorporation of all railroad lines. Legislative Program of Railroads. From an authoritative Bourco is ob tained tho following outline of the leg islative program which tho railroads will ftsk the committee to consider in Us Investigation: They will endeavor to demonstrate to the commission that ono of tho principal defects in the pres ent system of railroad regulation Is the lack of coordination resulting from the simultaneous aud conlllctlng regu lation by the federal government and by tho 48 states. They will, therefore, ask that entire governmental control of the rates and practices of interstate carriers, except purely local matters, be placed In the hands of a federal body so that interstate traffic may bo regulated without reference to state lines, leaving to the stato commissions Jurisdiction only over local matters aud local public utilities. As a part of this plan, a compulsory system of federal incorporation Is to bo recommended, accompanied by federal supervision of railroad stock and bond issues. A reorganization of tho Interstate Commerce Commission will be asked, in order to enable tho commission prop erly to cxerclso its increased powers. It Is also proposed that tho preparation aud prosecution of cases against the railroads shall be delegated to some other agency 4t tho government, possi bly tho Department of Justice, so that tho commission may devoto its ener gies to Us administrative functions. AVlth the commission thus relieved of sorao of its present duties and equip ped to handle its business more prompt ly, tho railroads will urge that the pe riod during which Uie commission may now suspend proposed increases In rates bo reduced from ten months to 00 days, with provision for reparation to be paid to the shippers if the ad runce shall be declared unreasonable. They will also usk thut the commis sion bo given tho power to prescrlbo minimum as well as maximum rates so that In meeting complaints of dis crimination the commission may order tho advanco of a rate which it consid ers too low. Oiiq. of the moHtJmportaut jecom- itieiiilntlotis for which tlio rnllroniTs will nsk favorulilo consideration Is twit the commission bo specifically authorized to tnku Into account In rnto regulation tho effect of rates upon total earnings In tho light of ex penses. While tho Newlands Committee Is required, under the resolution creat ing It, to submit a report by Jnnuary 2 next, it Is not anticipated that tbo Coimulttco will have como nnywlicra near completing Its labors then. County Agent's Field Notes BY A. II.IrSCKIIOKP. Short Course Instead of Institute But a few more names ane need ed to assure the short course for Dakota county. Instead of tho reg ular one day institute, there will be five days in which regular courses in agriculture will be offered. Prof. K. E. Warner, who was formerly en gaged in the Minnesota, university and now with the University of Ne braska, will handle the work with the live slock. Mr. Warner is n masttr in the art of butchering, cut ting and caring of meats as well as a specialist in the feed and care of live stock. His connection with tho short course is sure to insure unusu al quality. Prof. I. D. Wood, of the Depart ment of Agricultural Engineering, will have charge of thh farm mo ters division. With tho ndvent of so many tractors in this section and the use of kerosene and gasoline as feeds for farm power instead of corn and oats, this feature should be of especial interest. Professor Wood will demonstrate with models of different farm motors. Ho also re quests any one who has had trouble in getting engines started to bring them in and he will find the trouble and put them in runnning order be fore the class. To many of the ladies Miss Scott needs no introduction. The high class of her work in connection with the Womens Rural Short Course last summer will be remembered. The work offered the women will be more distinct and advanced as the program will show. Miss Itokahr, who will have charge of the foods preparation and service, comes espe cially well qualified. Tho women's side of this short course is just as strong as the men's and we hope that it will be a grand succesa in the point of interest and attendance. Let al get together and boost to make this the biggest event of tne year. Read the announcements next week.
