CONGRESS WIRE CREDIT CUT BY WESTERN UNION Serves Notice Members Most Pay in Advance For Messages. , IRELAND ASSAILS COMPANY'S EDICT House Chairman Says New Method Will Be Inconvenient. The Western Union Company has nerved notice on Congress that It will no longer receive official nussges from member* ouUude of Washington unless payment Is made in advance. The notice of this chance, to become effective with the beginning of the New Tear, was - sent yesterday to members at the House by Representative Clifford Ireland, of Illinois, chairman of the Committee on Accounts. The action of the telegraph company In relation to members of Congress is the latest move la the company's war on the government. The compan yhas previously served simlfer notice on the government departments. Company Telle mt Losses. It ha* complained to Congress that the present method of centralised billing Is an abnormal procedure. results In the loss of many telcgrama, In much unnecessary cp< respond* nee and excessive bookkeeping and auditing. By this method all telegrams sent by members of the House, regardless of the point of .origin, are forwarded to Washington, where a monthly consolidation gill is submitted to the House Committee on Accounts. "Under the system proposed by tk* Western Union Company, each member would have to open a charge account with every Western Union office in his district, and whenever he sent a telegram from that office a separate bill at government rate would be submitted to him," Mr. IrvmmPm (Uouncemtnt said. _ "He woal4**lther have to pay the bill and submit a voucher to the Committee on Accounts for reimbursement. or be Would have to certify to the correctness of the gill, with the telcgrama to which the bill would *ep*M^y the House disbursing cle*c. Wemld Xee4 Mm Clerk*. 'This would be* in tfie opinion of the committee. % decided inconvenience and would necessitate additional clerks in both the Committee on Accounts and the disbursing office to handle the tremendous volume of work It wen Id entail." The House ha^ no recourse but to devise a new method for paying for the messages in the opinon of Mr. Ireland. The tentative plan, as outlined by him. is to ?11ot each member a certain sum to be determined by the distance his district is from Washington for the purpose of meeting the expenses of telegrams. Phis to Zese Cevatry. It is proposed, he said, that the country be divided Into eleven zones and upon the basis of the distance from each zone to Washington that the members be appropriated sufficient money to meet the expenses of between twnty-flve and thirty average telegrams a month. ? Official telegrams have previously been sent, without any inconvenl* #ence attending the payment of the I message, under the franking privileges of Congress. The proposed substitute would save the government some thousands of dollars, but would put the members of the House to much inconvenience and operate with considerable incqualf-, ties.

Representative Kitchln. ranking Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, who will be the minority leader in the next Congress, assailed the Houston proposals as wholly intended "to relieve the corporate Interests and millionalrese " Overnight study of the Secretary's report resulted In practicslly a unanimous sentiment among the leaders of the two houses that not only would his demand for tax Increases be rejected, but his estimates for appropriations for next year will be mercilessly slashed Chairman Good, of the House Appropriations Committee, which, unnvIJnew !?te?. has jurisdiction over all appropriation measures, declared the estimates of t4.653.S4g.74} 12500 nnn SUJ d<l*n to approximately 3,500.000,000.

If the Democrats bad control of the House I am sure the Ways and Means Committee and the House itself would unanimously reject them. The whole intent and policy of yis recommendations are to relieve the corporate interests and milllonatres who for the last four years have plundered and profiteered upon the people to the extent of 1*0,000,000.040, of ?1.500.000.000 or 000,000 of taxed annually, and to place that amount upon the backs of the people, that is, the victims of such plunderers snd profiteers Martial Late Reported Decided Upon for Erin

I TRIBUNAL MAY BE LEFT TO NATIONS ' Step Contemplated by Committee Violates Article XV, Experts Say. 7 BURNET HBMHIiY. GENEVA. D*<-- f.?Desperate at: tempts are being made today to I save The Hague International- court I of justice project from what Its supporters her* term the menace of. extinction. The word extinction is perhaps too prematurely applied* as regard^ the fatep of the court, although the matter Is by no means sailing In smooth waters here and the danger that the world will not receive the charter for a long time, is a genuine one. | One thing almost certain today Is | that this assembly will adjourn I without attaining Its most cher! ished purpose?the creation of a world court as envisaged In article XV of the covenant. This Is what an ardent group of representatives Is fighting desperately to avert and they are today searching for an understanding With the powerful opposition that developed In the committee of Jurists engaged In the revision of the Root-Phllllmore draft scheme. OftMltln la Serieu. The oppoaition Is serious, for It alms taking the creation ot the court out of the haoda of the assembly and making the whole process one for the chancellories and parliaments of the respective nations represented in the league. Fully two-thirds of the commltte* of jurists favor the adoption of a plan by which the -court project before becoming operative would be first submitted to all the governments or to a conference of plenipotentiaries for signing the convention. which would thaa require the separate ratification of each parliament. Thif procedure, which is being urged t>y conservative member* of appear* t* baa* ened tome oT trie smaller European countries Into an acceptance of almost any compromise in order to save the court. It should be remembered Chat in the minds of many here tbc court still stands out as the one tangible, practical result this assembly could have and they are therefore bending all their efforts to put it through. 4 Violates Artlrlo XV. Not only would such a step as is now contemplated by the committee violate the express stipulation or Article XV of the covenant, which gives the league and tho assembly particularly full power to create and start and a court of justice. It is argued, but it would rob the assembly of the last, vestige of iniatlve and power and reduce it to impotency of an international debating society. This move is regarded as a part of the general policy pursued here by a group of states to deplete the assembly of its competency in matters relating to world policy. It is in direct line with everything done up to now to minimize the importance of the assembly by placing a vague interpretation on the article of the covenant defining its powers. It is frankly admitted that 1/ the powers have decided to bring the court project withhi the orbit of their foreign offices no amount of debating in Geneva will avail anc this court, intended to have been the work of the assembly of nations, will follow its predecessors along the cautious road of the old diplomacy. A frank discussion of Japanese policy toward China was entered into this evening by Baron Hayashi. Ambassador to Great Britain, and head of the Japanese delegation to the assembly. He told correspondents that Japan is now concentrating her efforts to open negotiations with China for the return of the former German provinces. The one primary condition for the return of these territories, he said, was a united Chinese nation whose guarantees, such as the restoration of free trade in those provinces, could be accepted as binding. DMbt About la tent leas. "There Is some doubt as to our good intentions toward China,'* Baron Hayashi said, "but we are ready to prove we intend to return the regions w% hold. So far the other powers holding Chinese concessions have not relinquished them. Big powers like the United States. ^ Great Britain and France are just beginning to work in harmony tq get China out or her present chaotic condition. As faf- as we are concerned we regard the present plight of our neighbor with the greatest sympathy. "We hope that some time in -the near future, say ten years from now China will enjoy a position in the league on an equal footing as a power with Japan. China must Arst. however, heal Its divided self, get a' strong man at the head of her af-< fairs and reorganise her communications and administration. She must get rid of her military governors and her army of a million, the feeding of which is draining her resources. "But it is Only gradUaly and methodicaly that China can attain political and economic emancipation. She is now seekin gtarllf reform and her former ? territorial privileges. They will come only as a result of patient endeavor on the part of China's young educated men." (Oomigfct. Itm. PsbUe^lsdger Cs.) Turk-Armenian Pact Signed.

A Home Loan Board, with branches In every postofllce In the country, is crcated under Kelly's bill, thus linking the new project up directly with the postal system. Instead of the postal savings system loaning money to banking In; terests at a low rate, the money would be loaned to votentlal home builders, the Interest rate on the postal savings being Increased from S to 4 par cent. Cnder the present practice, Kelly said, money deposited in the postal savings system Is loaned by the government to banks and banking interest* at Hi per cent interest.

FACING ATTACK Believe Leygues' Policy on Foreign Questions Will Force Fall. By WYTHK WILLIAMS. PARIS. Dec. }.?The Leygues cabinet probably will not survive the parliamentary attack which Is set for December 17 on the Greek and Russian questions, but which will be most forcefully directed against the ministers of war and finance. There is every indication that the struggle will end with Rene Vivian! as premier, for even If Leygues succeeds in defending himself personally. the hostility toward Andre Lefevre, minister of war. and Francois Marsal, minister of finance, will put the government in the minority and make it almost hopeless for Leygues to reorganise the cabinet, as M. Mlllerand. It Is thought, will first ask him to do. it is possible that M. Lefevre will reslgrf before the Interpellation on his policy comes before the chamber and that Premier Leygues, who appears before the committee on foreign affairs of the chamber tomorrow. will be able to explain the London conference to their satisfaction. The criticism of M. Lefevre is based on the failure of the war Obpartment to place before the chamber the projects demanded by tne military committee for the reorganisation of the army on a recruitment system and for a shorter period of military sen-ice. The attacks against X. Marsal come from the senate, where it Is likely his financial policy will be cubjocted to a grilling examination next week. As for M. Leygues, it la thought In Inner circles that as fsr as his Greek policy is concerned the re?'. the 1'on<lon Par?y\are so, sat sfactory to the French Vliat It will receive the almost unanimous approval of the chamber and the renate, although events In the Near Bast may make tbe future mors gloomy for the premier.

"There is now 1170,000.*00 oa deposit in postal savings banks. By removing the present SS.100 limitation on individual savings deposits and paying 4 per ceat instead f 2 per cent interest, the total deposits could be increased to billions," he asserted.

"We need 12.000.000.000 a year to furnish the homes needed hy people who would build their own homes if they could." Under the Kelly plan the proposed Home oan Bank would be made up of members of the Cabinet. Each local community would be served by a postal aavings bank with a local board of directors Including the postmsater. two cperls in local realty values and two members elected by the depositors. Applicants for loans would be required to have on deposit at least 10 percent of the amount Uiey desired to borrow. "No one will deny." said Kelly, "that these two changes?removal of limitation on deposits and Increase In interest rates?will result in the mobilisation of mon*y sufficient to meet the housing snd home ownership needs. ^ "Sixty per cent of all Americans live in rented quarters and tenantry is increasing each year. These facts point out one of the most serious problems before the nation. 'The cost of such a'situation may be found in congested slum districts where contagious diseases spread abroad; in new burdens upon those already sorely pressed by the price of food and clothing, and In social unrest and discontent, with all the menacing evils that follow in the train of a widespread sense of Injustice in the minds of Americans.

S. View Should tl^e whole of Armenia turn Bolshevist, as reported as happening. the United States government's attitude toward that country will b? radically altered, it is believed in circles here. If Armenia turns Red it is quite certain thst President Wilson will withdraw his recommendation to Congress, contained in the message submitted this week, that an American loan be granted to "the struggling government of Armenia." It would be contrary, it is pointed out, to the stubbornly-maintained policy of the Wilson-Colby regime at the State Department to accord any sort of recognition, not to say financial aid, to any government anywhere that was conducted on Bolshevist principles. The President might not obstruct a scheme of American aid to the Armenian people, but If they were subjected to a Bolshevist regime. as the people of Russia are. the idea of official American help would present serious and perhaps insuperable difficulties. American mediation waits entirely on the allied powers* ability to show President Wilson that it is a practicable thing. If the Red flag floats in Armenia, the mediation scheme. It is thought In Washington, will vanish into thin air. Chicago Grain.
