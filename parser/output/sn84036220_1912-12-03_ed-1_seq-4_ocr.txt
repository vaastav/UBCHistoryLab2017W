CONGRESS MEHS FOR VERY NEITHER THE TARIFF OR THE CURRENCY WILL BE TAKEN UP AT PRE8ENT. Washington, Dec. 1.—The expiring Sixty-third congress will assemble to morrow at noon for its final work of legislation. In tne brief period remain ing before constitutional limitation brings it to an end, 15 appropriation bills, carrying more than $1,000,000, 000 for the support of the government, I must be passed; the impeachment of Judge Archbald of the commerce court, must be tried in the senate; many in vestigating committees must make their reports, and scores of legislative subjects must be disposed of. Throughout the session will run the preparatory work for the extra ses sion to be caned soon after President elect Wilson takes office. Committees will thresh out questions of tariff, cur rency and anti-trust legislation in the effort to have democratic policies shaped and democratic plans made be fore the administration comes Into power. It ih assured, say legislative leaders, that tnere will be no tariff legislation this winter. It is expected that neither the currency nor the anti-trust prob lems will receive much attention, the principal work of the session being confined to preparations for the demo cratic administration and the enact ment of some of the more important bills pending on the calendars of the two houses. Important bills to receive attention include the bill for a department of labor, which Senator Borah said today would be pressed for immediate ac-1 tlon; the Sheppard-Kenyon bill, pre*! venting shipments of all liquors into "dry" states ;the Page bill to give fed eral aid to vocational and agricultural schools, and the resolution for a con stitutional amendment limiting a pres ident to a single term of six years. The annual estimates for appropria tions are ready and will be sent to morrow to the house. President Taft's message will be brought in Tuesday with some of his recommendations for the year. Senators in Washington would not venture opinions as to the outcome of the struggle in that body over the se lection of a presiding officer. Sena tor Bacon will act as presiding officer until December 16 by an agreement made last August. It is believed the senate will then continue him as pre siding officer of the court of impeach ment until the Archbald trial is con cluded. HER 

LEGS BROKEN 70 TIMES. Young rxansas Girl the Victim of a Remarkable Malady. The victim of a rare disease of the bones, Margaret Williams, the twelve year-old daughter of a wealthy farm er living near Medora, has suffered seventy fractures of the legs and more than a dozen of uie arms. Ever since she has been old enough to walk the bones of her legs and arms have snapped at the slightest jar or quick movement. Her legs and arms are gnarled from the numerous fractures. Physicians who have treated the girl say her bones lack some element. They are soft and spongy. Her leg bones are not strong enough to sup port her and the least jar or shock results in a iracture. When she was barely two years old, just beginning to walk, her leg bones flrst broke. Her parents believed she had fallen too heavily. LAter, as she was growing, every now and then a bone would break. Sometimes it was, tne shin, more frequently the thigh, and occasionally a bone of the foot.! Fortunately for the girl she did not suffer as much pain from these frac tures as do otners under normal con ditions, but as she grew older the fractures became more painful and she suffered greatly. It was neces sary to treat the fractures the same as »n other cases, and the chnd spent fully one-half of her time lying help less with uer legs in splints. Not only her legs, but her arms were affected similarly. The arms were not broken as often as the legs, however, as they did not bear her weight. But every little jar or push with her hands meant a fractured arm or wrist. The parents of the girl say they do not know how many times their daugh ter's bones have been fractured. They know of 70 times -nat her legs have been broken, but they have kept no count of the other breaks. Margaret now rides in an arm wheel chair. It is dangerous for her to take a step. The last time her legs were broken was about three months ago, when she attempted to cross a room. Both legs gave way under the weight of her body.

Remarkable Mixture in Territory In volved in Peace Terms. Here is a recent English estimate of the division of races in the six Turkish vilayets of Kossovo, Scutari, Janina, Monastir, Salonica and Adrianople, whose fate is involved in the peace terms now being discussed: Greek Church Bulgarians, 1,367,000; numerous in all the vilayets except Scutari and Janina. Pomaks, or Mohammedan Bulga rians, chiefly south of Adrianople, 255, 000. ...... Greek c,nurch Serbs, 200,000. This * s undoubtedly an underestimate, inhere may be two or three times as many. Arnauts, or Mohammedan Serbs, ^iDOO; again probably a decided un derestimate. away irom Roumania. The Turks are a thin layer everywhere. The Greeks are more numerous in Adrianople, to which they have no claim, than in Monammedan Turks, 800,000; less than one-third in every voayet. Greek Church lurks, o,00u. Orthodox Greeks, „„.,000. Greek Church Wallachians, mostly the widely scattered "Kutso-Vlachs," 279,000. Moslem Albanians, 900,v00. Catholic Albanians, chiefly of the seven highland clans of the Malissori, near Scutari, 170,000. Greek Church Aioanians, 110,000. Gypsies, mainly nominal Moham medan, „ v,000. Jews, 66,000. Besides these there are an unknown number of Montenegrins just over the line in the hills, 30,000 Armenians, speaking and writing ureek, Armenian or Turkish, but mostly Greek Church in religion, and others. To divide tuese races is impossible. They are all mixed together. The Rou manians are most numerous furthest Salonica and Janina, part of which they expect to get. An independent Albania would solve the worst single tangle, as only in the Albanian territory in the west are the Mohammedans clearly in a great ma jority. But there are more than 200, 000 Christian Albanians; they are cliieuy in tue north. They "prove their doctrine orthodox by apostolic blows and knocks at the 900,000 Mo | hamraedain Albanians and threaten to become o iSter. the Home Rule -New York World. Albania's MIGHTY TEXAS. This Country Is Not Big Enough to Swing the Lone Star State In. Texas is so big that if it swung around in a circle over the United States it would touch the Great Lakes to the northward, to the east would reach the Atlantic, westward the Pa cific and southward the Caribbean Sea. "The state of Texas is first in size, first in agriculture and first in live stock." Her farmers annually market crops to the value of $561,339,000, and there are 30,000,.-0 acres of land un der cultivation, and she raises three quarters of a bale of cotton per capita for each of her 4,000,000 people. The field crops of Texas are cotton, wheat, oats, alfalfa, rice, potatoes, tobacco, sugar cane and forages, while her fruits include peaches, apples, pears, berries, figs and citron fruits of all kinds, and in certain sections, for instance, the Rio Grande valley, ... . _ . - " is more, three or tour crops can be raised each year from the same land without the use of fertilizer.

The in crease in the truck and fresh-fruit in dustry has been wonderful in the past year, it having expanded at such a rate that the railroads have had trouble in providing sufficient refrig erator cars to keep pace with it. A conservative estimate by railroad traffic men in Texas places the total movement of vegetables and fruit in that state for the year 1912 at upward of 30,000 cars, and wben the fact is considered that all of this traffic is , , . , , comparatively new business, it speaks most effectively of the development that is going on in the state of Texas, aB on *7 a tow years ago the railroads *^d not take into consideration the tew carload shipments of fruits and vegetables they handled out of Texas, while at present such shipments form a very important leature of the rail road tonnage of that state.

Norris of Montana is the choice of people of that state for secretary of the interior, according to Tom Stout of Lewistown, congressman-elect, who is in Minneapolis today on his return from Chicago. "We feel," said Mr. Stout, "that Governor Norris knows more about public land questions than any man in the United States. He is thoroughly informed on the irrigation and reclamation questions, and other matters which come directly within the province of the interior depart ment, and Montana Is more directly interested in these questions than any other state, having more public land in its borders to be administered than any state. So we think we ought to have something to say about who shall be secretary o. me interior. We think it should be a western man, and one familiar with these subjects, and not a tneorlst. In five years as governor, Mr. Norris has made a close study of these things. The people of Montana, regardless of party, will be behind him, and will urge his appointment to the cabinet." Mr. Stout Is pub lisher of the Fergus County Demo crat and a member of the Montana senate. He will serve In the legisla tive session this winter, as his con gressional term does not begin until March 4. * Your Wife Cooks 1095 Meals Each Year In an Average Wedded Life of 35 Years She Cooks 38,325 Meals (T his doe* not include Leap Year or Church and Lodge Suppers) When you are at lodge, hunting, fishing, or at the dub, she is either cleaning house , looking after the children, or preparing a paper for the Woman's Club.

This year, as in former years, we are advocating a sane Christmas, a ^uristmas wherein everything that is given must be useful, meri torious and of value in the giving of such gifts as were quite frequent years ago, gifts that so often gave the recipient heart failure rather than pleasure. In addition to the matter of gift-giving wearables and items from our Men's Furnisnlng Department and Dry Goods Department, why not think of some item in the food line. There may be some family that is entirely deserving of charity. This charity you may hide in the line of a gift or there may be some friend to whom you desire to give a large, generous basket of good things. Of course what to get is the question. THE
