Mr, McKinley, has seen . fit to Indorse the La Fayette memorial com mission, organized for the purpose of erecting a monument to the memory of Ithe French soldier .in the city of Paris las a twentieth century tribute from the people of the United States, to be un veiled.

October 19. 1898.. was observed in thousands of American schools as "La Jfayette day," and many thousands of dollars were then contributed by the youth of the land toward the monument fund. j La Fayette's' career was, leaving aside kll prejudices 'and political considera tion, an interesting one. Let us sum St up briefly: . Born at the Chateau do jChavagnac, in Auvergne, September 6, 1757, the scion of one of the oldest houses of the French noblesse, he was left an orphan at a very early age.. He was educated at the College de Plessis, Paris, and at the age of 16 married, and entered the French army. Soon after- iward he became acquainted with Frank- lin, Deane and Lee, tie Parisian agents (of the American revolutionists, im- ibibed their independent spirit and re solved to draw his sword for the strug- ' Igling colonies. He accordingly fitted (out a vessel at Bordeaux, and narrowly t I escaped arrest, sailed from a Span Ush port, ( accompanied by several French officers, among them the fa mous Baron de Ealb. I On April 25, 1777, the marquis landed at Charleston, S. C, and, proceeding to ' 

WHERE LAFAYETTE IS BURIED. tPhiladelphiaf'where the congress was fthen in session, made an offer to that body to serve as a volunteer in the revo Outionary Varmy. This offer was ac cepted, and La Fayette, out of respect to hla high rank, was commissioned a mejor general, July 31, 1777. He soon iron the favor and friendship of George Washington, and rendered really dis tinguished cervices to the cause of the patriots at the battles of Erandywinc maA Monmouth. At the end of 1778, .-war having been declared between his town country and Great Britain, the gnarquis, who still retained his com mission in the French army, obtained leave of absence and sailed for home Jn January, 1779. He was received with unbounded enthusiasm by the trench people, who at the time were rfnll of revolutionary ideas and breamed. wt tvaai xlrfiti and succeeded la obr tainlng from tie government assist ance, both in men and money, for the American cause. Thereupon La, Fayette recrossed the Atlantic and rejoined Washington in May, 1780. Shortly after his arrival the French auxiliary force, under the command of Kochani beau, arrived. After obliging the well equipped army of Lord Cornwallis to surrender at Yorktown, the marquis again returned to France, and in 1784, after the independence of the United States had been recognized, again re visited our country. Returning to Paris, after a brief stay, La Fayette assumed his public duties as a member of the assembly of nota bles, and at once became the champion of radicalism. After bringing about the convocation of the states-general, in 1789, he was appointed commander in chief of the national guard of Paris, in which capacity he succeeded In sav ing the lives of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette from the rabble which had taken possession of the palace of Ver sailles, on October 5 and 6. When, soon afterward, the national assembly passed a decree for the abolition of nereditary titles, La Fayette was the first to relinquish his rank of marquis. In March, 1792, war being declared against Austria, lie was made com- ! mander of the frontier army corps, and won the battles of Philippeville, Mau berge and Florennes. On August 8 he J was openly denounced by the Jacobins ; as a traitor to his country; and, after i escaping arrest at the bands of their emissaries, fled 'into" Germany, where j he was- captured by the Austrian s and imprisoned in the fortress of Olmnetz. In 1824 tne congress ol tne United States passed a resolution requesting President Monroe to extend an invita tion to La Fayette to visit this country once more. He complied, and landed at New York on the 15th of August. His tour partook of the character of a triumphal progress, and congresaj in December, voted him a grant of $200, 000 and a township, in recognition of his services during the revolution. In September, 1825, he returned to France. The unconstitutional ordinances of Charles X., in June, 1830, which caused his own expulsion, brought La Fayette before the people once more; and it 'was to him, intrusted with the power of dictator, in his character as com mander of the national guard, that Louis Philippe owed his elevation to the throne. La Fayette died in 1834, and received the greatest public fu reral of which modern French annals ! possess any record. '. nis remains still rest in the burial grounds of the con vent of- Petit Picpus, together with those of nearly 1,500 victims of the guillotine and the revolution. His grave is generally unknown and for gotten, and is marked only by a plain granite slab. Whatever may have been La Fayette s shortcomings, toward the lawfully es- tf.blished authorities of the continental army he never failed to show scrupu lous loyalty. When sorely tempted, by Washington's dissatisfied generals to lead an army into Canada, and to stir up a revolution among the French set tlers in that country, in opposition to the chief commander's wishes, he put the temptation from him, and re mained true to the man to whom he owed his elevation to rank and power in the American service. And as La Fay ette remained true to Washington, so the great commander remained faithful to the young Frenchman. Carlyle, that harshest of English writing judges, places a low estimate on La Fayette's character. He calls him fickle and a demagogue. Perhaps he was both, to a certain extent. Political greatness, in all ages, has depended upon a man's ability to adapt himself to circumstances. La Fayette preached radicalism when the mob was about ready to wreak vengeance on its oppres sors; and that his arguments hastened the beginning of the French revolution and the inauguration of the reign of terror cannot be logically disputed. But the motives which actuated him were pure. He sympathized with the starving, oppressed multitudes and was honestly anxious to ameliorate their condition. The excesses which fol lowed whenr the Jacobins secured con trol of the government were as dis heartening to La Fayette as to every other lover of humanity. He learned the great lesson that freedom is not the growth of a day, but of generations, too late. He had become so familiar with Anglo-Saxon conservatism while serv ing in the American army that when the time came he failed to make allow ance for Gallic instability and intrigue. While helping to give freedom to Amer icans, he let loose in his own land the demons of license.- Q. W, WETPPIBJRTy T 10- Customary Formalities Enacted at Noon. Were Program As Laid Out For the Session No Legislation For the Philippines Hawaii and Army Reorganization the Main Features The President's Message. Washington, Dec 5. The curtain was rung up to-day upon the closing session of the Fifty-fifth congress. The war and the fruits of the American vic tory carry in their wake many problems which the national legislature must solve. But, though many' questions may press for solution, the brief space cov ered by this session, which expires by limitation March 4, precludes the possi bility of .much betng accomplished be tKnd the passage of the regular money budgets, the legislation for the increase of the regular army which the admin istration deems necessary to meet the obligations Imposed upon the country by the result of th war and probably the enactment of a law to give a per manent territorial government to the Hawaiian Islands. This covers all the important legislation which the con gressional leaders expect to see enacted at this session. It is almost the unan imous sentiment of the leaders that no attempt should be made to legislate concerning the possessions acquired by the war with Spain at this session. There are earnest advocates of the Nic araguan canal bill who will strive to secure its passage now, and they may possibly be successful, but neither it nor any one of the measures like the pooling bill, antiscalpers' . bill, etc., which have strong friends, will be al lowed to Interfere with- the bills the passage of which is deemed absolutely necessary to prevent an extra session. The leaders at both ends of the capltol have put their heads together, and the work of the session is to be entered upon with the idea of avoiding an extra session. With this purpose In view, the appropriation bills are to be given the road and pressed through with all pos sible haste. . Two subcommittees of the appropria tion committee of the house have been at work for a week. The deficiency bill to meet the extraordinary expenses of the army and navy during the six months from Jan.- 1, 1898, to July 1 is ready to submit to the full committee, and the regular District of Columbia appropriation bill will be ready by the end of the week. It is necessary that the former should become a law before the holiday recess, which this year is to be shorter than usual, and Chairman Cannon hopes to see 1t through the house and Into the senate before the end of the present week. The Demo crats of the house have not disclosed their position, but it is not believed they will seek to obstruct an appro priation bill necessary for the mainte nance of the army now ,in the field. Should there be a disposition to open up and prolong a debate upon the conduct of the war upon this bill it is safe to as sume that the committee on rules will be Invoked to bring in an order to close debate. The senators express a determination to take up the work of the session vig orously In the beginning with the hope of having it well , advanced before the holidays, and they are counting upon taking up the appropriation bills at a Very early date for the purpose of pre venting an extra session due to any failure on the part of the national budget. It is expected that the army deficien cy bill will reach the senate during the present week, the understanding at the north end of the capitol being that the house will dispose of it within a very few days after assembling. The com mittee on appropriations will bring It in early for the double purpose of hav ing it passed quickly and of testing the feeling of senators on questions con nected with the war. It is impossible to say what matters will occupy the week after the disposal of the president's message, but it is probable that some speeches may be de livered upon the policy indicated by the message and also that the calendar may be taken up. There are many measures which have been reported and there will be no difficulty to find em ployment if the senate is disposed to settle to routine so early in the ses sion. During the closing days of the last session Senator Morgan gave notice of hl3 intention to call up the Nicaragua canal bill at the beginning of the pres ent session. He unquestionably will re deem this promise and would doubtless seek the first opportunity but for the possibility of change of sentiment In favor of having the government under take the entire responsibility of build ing the canal. All the indications are that this question will be one of the most prominent subjects under consid eration during the session. Opposition is developing to the bill which the Hawaiian commission will bring in and for which early considera tion will be asked. There is a consider able contingent in the senate opposed to constituting the islands into a terri tory because of the apprehension that they may be converted into a state, and deliberate consideration of the subject will be asked. While it is quite too early to reach a definite conclusion there are decided in dications of a disposition on the part of the senate to confine -the session's work to routine measures and the ap propriation bills, and it need surprise no one if the close of the session would demonstrate that this general polio had been pursued. Washington, December 5. At 1:25 p. m. the committee appointed to wait upon the president reported the 'per formance cf Its duty and announced that the president would immediately communicate with the senate in 'writ ing. Scarcely had the report been 'mad when Major Truden, executive clerk cf the president, entered 'the chamber and presented th'e message. Vice President Hobart laid it before the senate at once and the reading was begun at 1:28 p. m. At the house, after the assembling and the chaplain's prayer, the roll was called, . Which . developed the presentee of 267 members, sufficient for a quor um. Alter the usual resolutions were adopted, a recess iwas taken until 1:30 to await the arrival of the president's message. President (MeKinleys second annual message, submitted to congress to day, contains about twenty thousand words. Following is a brief synapsis, including some direct; excerpts of the more important features of the mes sage. To the Senate and House o Repre sentatives: "Notwithstanding the added' bur dens rendered necessary by the war, cur people rejoice in a very satisfac tory and steadily increasing degree of prosperity evidenced Iby the largest volume of business ever recorded. Manufacture has Ibeen productive, agri cultural pursuits have yielded abund ant returns, labor in all fields of in- dus'try is better rewarded, revenue legislation passed by the "present con gress 'has increased the treasury re ceipts to the amount estimated by its authors; the finances of the govern ment have been successfully adminis 'tered and its credit advanced to the first rank; rwhile its currency ihas "been maintained at the world's 'highest standard. Military servicie under a common flag and for a Tighteous cause has strengthened tlhe national spirit and served to cement more closely than ever the fraternal Tbonds between every section of the country." In reviewing the controversy which led up to the war with pain the pres ident takes up the thread of narrative where terminated in his last -message. He concluded: "It was 'honest ly due to our friendly relations with Spain that she slhouM foe given a Tea sonaible chance to realize her expec tations of reform to which she had be come irrevocably associated." "It became evident, hoiwever, that the proposed plans were 'barren of good results. No tangible relief iwas afforded the reeoncentrados, among whom the rate Of mortality frightfully incerased; the proffered expedient of cultivation proved illusory and it was apparent that nothing save the physi cal exhaustion of Sipain or the Cubans and the practical ruin of the island' of Cuba could result from the struggle then in progress. At this critical juncture,' the desecration of the battle ship Maine occurred. Concerning it the president says: "It is a striking evidence of the poise and sturdy good sense distinguishing our national dharacter that this Shocking blow fall ing on a generous people, already-deeply touched by preceding events, in Cu ba, did not move then to am instant. desperate Tesolve to tolerate no longer cne existence of a dondition of danger and disorder .at our doors that made possible such a deed, by whomsoever wrought." - . Resuming the war narrative, the president directs attention to - the measures increasing the $20,000,000 appropriation for national defense, ta ken to place the country on a war foot ing and adds: "It is sufficient to say that the outbreak of tlhe war, when it did co'me, found our nation -not un prepared to enter the conflict." Negotiations with the Madrid 'gov crnimen proved futile, so far as prac tical results were concerned and then it was the president presented the uestlon to congress, saying "In the name cf humanity; in the name of civilization; in behalf of endangered American interests which give us the r'aiht to speak and to act, the war in Cuba must stop." The result of this statement of the case was the adoption of the taeimo ralble joint resotution by congress, de claring the purpose of the United States to intervene between the Span iards and the Cubans. 'Following swiftly upon this calme the severance cif diplomatic relations Ibetiween the two countries, the proclamation tit a blockade of Cuban ports, the call for volunteers and the formal declaration cf the existence of a state of war. It is not among the feast gratifying in cidents of the struggle that the obli gations of neutrality were Impartiaflly discharged by all often under difficult cireum trances. The president reviews at length the wark of preparation for war, referring particularly to the erpl'lstment cf the volunteers, to the material increase of Mie navy in both men and ships and to the precautionary measures taken "cr 'I'ie prelection cf the seaboard oc-ast -and cities. The aggregate num ber of mines pla-oed ttss 1.535, at the Principal harbors from Maine to Cali 'ornia. Referring to the "difficult and im-wefl-tant character" of the work per "ormed by the si'gnaH corps, the presi dsnt says: "This service was inval u'a.ble to the executive in directing the erations of the army and navy. With a tc'tal force of over 1,300 the less was by disease, inc amp and field, officers and men incfluded, only five. As to the authorized loan of $200, 000,000 which was taken entirely by small holders, the president says: "This was a most encouraiging and significant result, showing the vast resources of the nation and the de termination of the people to uphold their country's honor." Taking up chronoiogically : the events of the war. the president re views them carefully. The first en counter was th-9 shelling of Matanzas on April 27. This was folowed by an engagement which was "destined to mark a memorable epoch in maritime warfare." This was Commodore Dewey's wonderful victory at Manila on May 1. "The effect cf this re nrark'aible victory," says the president "upon the spirit of our people and up on the fortunes of the war, was in stant. The prestige of invincibility thereby attached to our arms con tinued throughout the struggle." The president Says that "only reluctance to cause needless 'loss of life and prop erty prevented the early storming and capture of the city (M'anila) , and therewith the aibsolut9 military occu pancy of the whole group." Following the memorable trin of the baftlesbiT) Oregon from San Francisco to Key West and the bombardment of San Juan and the "forts of Santiago, to which special reference is made, the president says: "The next act in the war thrilled not atone the hearts of our countrymen, but the world, by its exceptional 'heroism On the night of June 3 Lieutenant Hobson, aided by seven devoted volunteers, blocked the narrow outlet from Santiago harbor by sinking the collier Merriimao in the Channel, under a fierce fire from the shore batteries, escaping with their lives as by a miracle but falling into the hands of the Spanlrads, It is a most gratifying incident of the war that the bravery of this little band of heroes was cordiailly appreciated by the Spanish admiral. The campaign of Santiago, resulting in the investment and capture of that city, is referred to as a brilliant achievemen't. A brief review is then presented of the decisive naval com bat of the war on July 3rd, resulting in the complete destruction of Admiral Oerveras fleet. Concerning it the president says: "Where all so conspic uously distinguished themselves, from the commanders to the gunners and the seamen heroes in the boiler rooms, each, and all contributing toward the achievement of this astounding vic tory, for which neither ancient or modern history affords a parallel in the completeness of the event and the marvelous disproportion of casuali ties, it would be invidious to single out any for a special 'honor." In this connection the president says "nor can we be unmindful of achievements of our builders, mechanics and artisans for their skill in the construction of our warships." As to the success gained by the arms of the United States the presiednt says that the earnest and lasting gratitude of the nation is unsparingly due. "Nor Should we alone remember the gal lantry of the living, the dead claim our tears, and our losses by the bat tle and disease must cloud any exul tation at the result and teach us the cost of war, however rightful the cause or signal 'the victory. "The total casualties in killed and wounded in the army during the war with Spain were: Officers killed, 25; enlisted men killed, 2S7; total, 280. Officers wounded, 113; enlisted men, 1,464; total, 1,577. Of the navy: Killed, 17; wounded, 67; died as re sult of wounds, 1; invalided from ser vice, 6; total, 91." 

FRENCH REPUBLIC TREMBLING There is a Growing Fear of a Coup . ,. , . D'Ktat : LONDON, Dec. 5. A situation full of turmoil is often seen in truer perspec tive from a little distance than in the midst, of its confusion. A correspondent returning to London after a stay of sev eral weeks in Paris says that such is thafcase with the pending French crisis. Events and " their meaning aavume a Clearer relationship than when viewed frOm the Avenue de l'Opera. It cannot be said, however,! that the situation is any less- serious when examined from the better vantage ground. - - If one were foolish ' enough to enter the dangerous field of prophecy, he would be almost inclined to indorse the startling declaration in The Spectator, which says boldly: "It is our sincere be lief, that a great event is immediately at hand in France." The reason for this ominous opinion is the fact that the French military au thorities have openly challenged the civil and judicial powers, and the only logical outcome of this policy is a mili tary coup d'etat, of which Premier Du puy, in scarcely veiled language, de clares he stands in fear. It is impossible to avoid some suspi cion of M. Dupuys good faith as well as his courage, for it must be borne in mind that he was premier when the Dreyfus infamy took place in 1894. It would be more charitable toi ascribe the government's attempt to shift the duty of postponing the Picquart court mar tial upon the court of cassation to cow ardice. There can be no doubt, however, that both Premier Dupuy and M. de Frey cinet, the minister of war, have not dared to postpone the Picquart trial, be cause they had reason to know that such an order would be resisted by Gen eral Zurlinden, and a crisis, which the present cabinet is afraid to face, would thus be precipitated.
