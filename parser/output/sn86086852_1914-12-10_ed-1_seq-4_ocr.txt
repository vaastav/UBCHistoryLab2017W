4 The Democrat. Entered at the Post Office, Mineral Wis. as second class matter. Sabaeription, 51 .25 per year in Advaace. Published every Thursday by % GEORGE CRAWFORD ft ROBERT M. CRAWFORD THURSDAY. DECEMBER 10, 1914. THE PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE. The message which President Wilson delivered to the congress yesterday ap pears on page three of this paper. Strong ground is taken against a stand ing army and militarism generally, and in favor of a powerful navy. This is he well settled Democratic policy. Read the whole message. It is a great state paper stated in the clear and forcible Woodrow Wilson way. 

SAFETY FIRST, The Chicago Tribune and other third party newspapers are discussing the question “Where will the Progressives go?” It will be even more important what patriotic men of independent thought and action do in the primaries of 1916 than what they do at the polls in November of that year. These men, who put country before party, often turn the scale for good in presidential elections. But unfortunately they only exercise a part of their citizenship. In their struggle for self government the colonies had long been accorded the right to elect before they won the right to nominate. At that time Crown ap pointed secretaries made the nomina tions : and they could only vote to elect or reject. Now in many states the nomination of candidates is hedged about by laws as well as is the election of candidates to office. And the nom ination of candidates is often the more important part of the work of self gov ernment. Because unless the names of worthy men are placed upon the official ballot they can never be elected. Under President Wilson’s leadership the Democratic party is progressing; while the Republican party, dominated by Rose Penrose and others, is pulling backward. Independent, patriotic men who would do their full share of the work which devolves upon them as good citizens should come at this time into the Democratic party. Their ser vices are needed to renominate Mr. Wilson, and to nominote forward look ng men for senators and representa tives, and for other offices. The safe course is to make sure that the Demo cratic candidates shall be progressive. 

TURN ON THE LIGHT. P. A. Badour, editor of The Oconto Enterprise and president of the Wis consin Democratic Press Association, strongly backs up the demand of The Milwaukee Journal for publicity in the matter of receipts and expenditures by the Wisconsin Taxpayers’ league. The Enterprise says: The Milwaukee Journal commenda bly is asking the Wisconsin Taxpayers’ league some very pertinent questions, and in view of the fact that the organ ization was back of Mr. Philipp’s candi dacy it would interest us very much if its questions were answered. The main question is: “Where did the league get the money with which to carry on its campaign?” We hope the Journal will get the information it seeks. 

GOOD TIMES ASSURED. Wherever men of business affairs get together for consultation good reason is given for optimism. At the American Mining Congress at Phoenix, Ariz., on Tuesday, George Otis Smith, director of the United States geological survey, delivered an address in which he pre sented most favorable conditions for profitable activity in farming, mining and manufacturing. Here is an extract from his address: Evidence of business betterment is before ns on every hand, and the rea sons for optimism are many. The United States farmer has harvested a five billion dollar crop and there is a high-price market for all our surplus food stuffs. Already our grain is pour ing across the Atlantic. The millions of men who are fighting are not work ing, and yet these hordes of soldiers must be clothed and equipped as well as fed. Foreign orders have started factory operation which at once tends to relieve the stagnation in the steam-coal trade, the steel situation has turned from serious depression to rapid im provement. and the whole mineral in dustry may soon expect to share in this general business improvement. Today the financial horizon is so nearly cloudless that the prophets of bad weather have little upon which to base their predictions. The new federal banking system makes the money re serves mobile as never before, and ex tension of credit is now possible, with out the veto power remaining in the hands of a small group of big men. Still another reason for belief in busi ness betterment is the recognition, now becoming widespread, of the general interpedence of big business and the general pnbb>. On the one side, the people me realizing that ihey are and have been in reality the silent partner big business, and now that there has come the promise of some regulation that will in large part prevent mono polistic centralization, the people are interested in getting their share of re turns that can come only with opera tion at a profit. On the other hand, the managers of the large corporation, the trustees of the investing public, are beginning to that a certain financial security goes with public confidence, and that the attitude to the public so tersely expressed thirty years ago by a pioneer in railroad financing does not pay dividends today. While European countries have been mobilizing their armies and calling to the field of battle their reserves of sol diers, America has mobilized its credit and begun to send forward to the market place its vast reserves of food stuffs and mineral products. NO ALUM fn DrPRICE’S bakinglpowder PRESS POINTS Platteville News: The school house is the place for public meetings and the best way to bring about the public meetings at the school house is to or ganize a Social Center movement and have all questions discussed there. If the average citizen gets the facts correct on any public question he can be trusted to do the right thing, Bloomington Record: The big “vic tory” some Republicans are claiming at the recent election would have been given the Democrats a majority of 100 votes in the electoral college in a presi dential election. So long as the Re publicans rejoice over that kind of a “victory” there should be no difficulty about re-electing President Wilson in two years. Blanchardville Blades: All mac adamized roads constructed in Green county in 1915 will be oiled before they are pronounced complete. Avery good idea. It should be done in every coun ty in state where these roads are built. It preserves them to a great extent. Waterloo Democrat: The city of Janesville is very proud of the record made under the commission form of government which was adopted two years ago. The tax rate per thousand dollars has fallen from $18.50 to $9.26, and this in spite of the fact that more permanent improvements have been made than in any 3 years together previously. The city has three com missioners who devote their entire time to the business of the city and who have charge of all the city business ex cept the public school management. Democratic Opportunity. Milwaukee Journal: The Democrats in Wisconsin can let the matter of their next national committeeman go by de fault or they can face the issue and do the thing that needs to be done. The only hope of Democracy in Wis consin lies in being a Progressive Dem ocracy. We can see a situation in which Wisconsin may become a Dem ocratic state, provided the party is not in the hands of Tories or Reactionaries. So far as Democracy is concerned, much will depend on the course pur sued by the new governor, Mr. Philipp. If he goes about the affairs of Wiscon sin in a businesslike and sensible man ner, he will appeal to men of all parties. But if he develops reactionary tenden cies, of which there are some indica tions,* he will build up the Democratic party. An astonishing thing was the bitterness Mr. Philipp showed in his speech at Appleton on the tax commis sion. The Tory Democratic and Re publican alliance of 1912 to destroy the income tax is still fresh in the minds of the people, and if it cannot be destroyed
