I London, Dec. 8 (Associated Press).? Premier Poincare haa come to London to suggest a "reasonable and just" way out of the reparations problen). He believes Great Britain, in the interest J of preservation of the Entente and fair play, should indorse his suggestions. Such is the view expressed by the French delegation to what the French Government believes will be the most important meeting of Premiers since the armistice, Premier Poincare is not impressed with reports of the new reparations settlement proposed by Chancellor Cuno of Germany. It would be viewed by the French, it is reported, as more of a maneuver than a real plan of settlement. Both Bonar Law and M. Poincare expressed hope that the conference would Insure Franco-British cooperation for many years to come. The suggestions of M. poincare form the basis of the plan which he is said to , be reserving for the proposed Brussels conference, and their adoption, in the opinion of the French, would Insure a solution at the Belgian capital. They are: A two or three year moratorium for Germany in return for certain definite guaranties, such as the temporary tnklner over of the mines and forests of Germany and the collodion of certain cttstuiu* as a means of forcing Germany to carry out reforms. A loan of 100.000,000 gold marks to be used to stabilize the mark, undor the strict supervision of the Reparations Commission. Thoro would be continuation of deliveries of coal and wood during the moratorium period. For Reduction of Indemnity. Reduction of the German indemnity to about 40.000,000.000 gold marks if England canceled the French debt, or. fulling this, an agreement to set aside for a long term of years all questions either of trying to collect this debt or tho so-called "reparation bonds." The lutter would. In effect, be reduction of the indemnity to well under 50,000,000,000 gold marks. Tho Brussels conference, according to the French plan, should be called as soon as possible, probably on December 18, so that details of settlement could be worked out before January 15, M. l'olncare Is described as frankly skeptical about the efficacy of his threatened independent military action in the Ruhr in event of failure to agree with Great Britain. Be is said to be willing to forget about this military action if Premier Bonar Law consents to economic guaranties in return for a moratorium, the guaranties to be Imposed more as coercive measures than as revenue producing measures. Asks About (7.X. Envoys. The Fronch Premier Is greatly Interested in the presence in London of the American Ambassadors to Germany and Belgium, Alanson B. Houghton an<l Henry F. Fletcher. Tie made several Inquiries to find out the purpose behind their visltH. Reports have been heard here that the UntUd States might unofficially intimate she would not ask for payments on the war debts for the duration of any moratorium, as a contribution to a settlement of the problem. Such a move, in the view of the French, would pave the way to a settlement of the debts between England and France. Great Britain's attitude In the conference will be a receptive one. So far as kttown the Government has no program. Some optimistic observers cling to the belief that Great Britain and the United States might cooperate in a big loan to Germany in case It Is proposed, coupling the idea with the suggestion that Germany use At least half the prooeeds to pay France, which would mean that for a long period part of the paymetc' ">f Germany's indemnity to France wo?id be shifted to the shoulders of those two solvent nations. The newspapers believe the United Slates proposes some sensational part In the present negotiations, but from other quarters which should be best informed comes a statement that the pre ience of the Americans has no greater significance than that they are beginning tlie practice of meeting for discuss r?f ?enernl interest to their Government Whllo there Is no arrangement as yet for any American to play a part In the Ixmrlon discussion*, some English papers think that the United States may have an observer at the Brussels conference.

The Turks' counter proposal made to-day, far from supporting: the Russian demand for closing the Dardanelles and the Bosporus to all warships, proposes that the waterway shall be open to vessels for commerce and to light warships for their protection, and in other respects furnishes a basis upon which a compromise may be reached.

The Soviet delegation seems to bo left high and dry as a result of the conciliatory policy of the Allies, which was designed to alienate the Turks from them. Most significant of the developments was the complete elimination by the Turks, from thetr counter-proposal as drafted last night, of Clause lit. of their four demands, which was plainly Inserted at the instance of the Ftussians and which prohibited the regular maintenance of warships and bases in the Black Sea. Another evidence that tbe Russians and the Turks have drifted apart was afforded when the Turks failed to support the Russian demand, voiced by Tehltcherln this afternoon, that In conferences to which the Allies Invite the Turks to bring their experts to discuss differences on the straits plan the Russians shall be admitted. It is In these conferences that a compromise probably will bo reached on the number and size of warships to be allowed through the straits. Turkish Concessions. The Turks have recognized: First?The Idea of a demilitarized zone around the straits. Second?Free passage of merchantmen In peace or war, subject only to right of search wtien Turkey Is a belligerent. Third?The Idea of an International commission to supervise the navigation of the waterway. Fourth?The passage of light warships for the protection of commerce. ljora *_.urzon ezprcsseq grat incut log at the Turks' acceptance of the principles of demilitarization and free passage of warships and merchant ships In peace and war. together with regulation of commerce by an International commission.

The TurVa did not persist In their previous demand that the Black Sea be kept free of allied warcraft or bases. The opinion advanced In American circles Is that as America does not wish to make trouble probably she will find acceptable whatever restriction as to the stralta the Turks and the Allies now agree upon. Realizing the split between the Russians and the Turks, the Allies pressed their advantage in to-day's session and showed conciliation on nearly all the Turkish points. There were: Guaranties for the security of the straits and Constantinople; defense of the Sea of Marmora by the Turks: permission to m?ve Turkish troops across the demilitarized sons; that the limits of th? proposed zone be narrowed, and that Turkey be permitted to erect defences on Galllpoll to prevent surprise attacks on Constantinople.

( Four prominent Irish irregular leaders?Rory O'Connor, Liam Mellowes, Joseph McKelvey and Richard Barrett?were executed in Mountjoy prison this morning in reprisal for the assassination of Deputy Sean Hales yesterday. With the execution of these men Eamon de Valera is now the only prominent rebel leader. O'Connor, who headed the old military executive, was generally considered to be the leader of the armed opposition to the treaty. Mellowes was secretary of the executive and also a violent enemy of the treaty. All four were caught when the Government last June recaptured the Four Courts building- after it had been seized and held by the rebels under O'Connor and Mellowes. It has not been officially announced | how the men were put to death, but it Is j ipresumcd they were hanged. The exi ecutlons took place soon after 9 o'clock ' by decree of a court-martial which had | been called Thursday to try them. Itrprlanl and Warning. The announcement by the Government that the executions had been carried out as a reprisal, and as a warning to those J "in the conspiracy of assassination . against the representatives of the Irish people," resulted in a stormy debate in the Dall, where the Government's policy was bitterly challenged, but In the end | the Government was upheld by a vote ot j 39 to 14. Deputy Tom Johnson, Laborite, led | the attack, which rose to its highest | pitch when Cathal O'Shannon, another ' l^aborlte, taunted the Cabinet with being unfit and Incompetent. "You nave J smashed the Irish Free State," he shouted. "Vou are loosing more anarchy ' than Rory O'Connor ever loosed from the Four Courts." William Fitzglbbon, one of the former Unionist supporters, made an intense appeal to the Cabinet not to repeat the action taken to-day. In his replies to these attacks William U\ Cosgrave, President of the Cabinet, revealed that only the evening previous to the assassination of Hales he had telephoned to Richard Muloahy, Minister of Defense, to say if there were any cases before the military courts he thought the time had come for a show of clemency. Mulcahy, Cosgrava said, held the same opinion. Krnest Blythe, Minister of Local Government, in Ills reply also mentioned that the Government had received reports of public opinion around the country In the last two weeks which showed that a drastic policy was Indorsed by tho people. Government Fiercely Attacked. ! The attack, in which George Gavan Puffy, a signatory of the treaty, joined, rested chiefly In the assertion that such leprlsnls were unlawful and unworthy of the Government and would not achieve the object of restoring peace. Deputy Corey, leader of the farmers, created a scene when he declared that he believed the I^tbor party's attack was Intended to Incite more murders, but was forced to withdraw his remark. Mulcahy, K?vln O'Higglns. Minister of Home Affairs; John McNeill, Minister of education; Blythe and finally Cosgrave replied to the attack, pleading the law of military necessity.' "I know full well that there Is a diabolical plot of assassination afoot," declared Cosgrave. "There la only one way to meet It. and that Is to crush It." The Cabinet Ministers argued that the very existence of the Irish nation was now at stake. McNeill asserted that the Government was obeying the elementary law that extreme necessity knows no limit. Mulcahy explained that the new policy of tho Irregulars was to attack the Government at the point of Its greatest vulnerability and that 1-- irnut take Immediate drastic nctlon lif the Uvea of the representative* of the people were to be spared. "While the existence of thla nation la at stake there la but one rode to yulde the action of those responsible for the OovI ernment." declared O'HIyrlns.

The main fear Is that the Irish people may lose their sympathy for the Government. If the present Government brlnys Ireland safely throuyh the metamorphosis and peace la established In the next two months there Is little doubt the v?rdlct of the next'electlon will be In favor of the Free State.

Long Island, issued yesterday, with the approval of William H. Woodln. State Fuel Administrator, local order No. 3, effective Monday. It is promulgated as a direct result of Thursday's fuel conference in Albany between Gov. Miller and the several district fuel administrators or the State. The order follows: "Each delivery of the sizes of anthracite known as grate, broken, egg, stove, chestnut or range coal, where such coal Is used for heating purposes and where the delivery consists of two tons or more, shall be preceded or accompanied by a delivery of not less than 25 per cent, of buckwheat, coke, bituminous coal or other substitutes. No delivery of less than one ton of substitutes is required under this order." lias to Arrept So lint Itntes. Tills order, Mr. Leuroyd explainfd, makes it obligatory upon the dealer to supply and upon the consumer to accept with every delivery, for Illustration, amounting to from two to four tons of domestic size anthracite an additional ton of some sort o' substitute fuel of those named. As the dealer Is not required to deliver any of these substitute grades In lota of less than one ton, this means that the customer who gets hereafter a two ton delivery of domestic anthracite must stand ready to accept along with It one ton (which in his case really amounts to BO per cent, of his two ton order) of the less d sit able substitute. Where the oelivery of domestic anthracite amounts to a single ton only, on the other hand, the obligatory use with It of substitute fuel does not apply. Should small consumers attempt tfl evade the spirit of the order by trying to have their dealers make successive one ton deliveries a few days apart, Mr. Learoyd said. It would not take the dealers long to detect and check the subterfuge. The order was drafted during n conference In wvhlcli Mr. Woodin, in hit office, IBS Broadway, met all the city's deputy administrators and also Commissioner Orover A. Whalen, who attended as the representative of Mayor Hylan. Mr. I,earoyd expressed the opinion that an Immediate resultant of this order would be the saving each week of from 16,000 to 20,000 tons of domestic anthracite. He tntlmated that, should the stringency become more acute. It might become necessary later to Issue a more drastic order. Mnrh f'nnl on Sidetracks. As proof that It Is possible for all retailers to obtain enough substitute fuel to enable them to comply with the order he cited figures showing that there are rtandlng on the rail at New Jersey tidewater points 3>,(inn tons (740 carloads) of the steam size anthracite and 1,520 tons (38 carloads) of the pea size anthracite. For all this fuel there were yesterday no orders. Mr. Learoyd estimated that, in addition, there were afloat here 50.'**) tona of No. 1 buckwheat (100 boatloads) and about 75.000 tona of soft coal.

( Some of the most pronounced radical and Insurgent leaders in Congress admitted to-night that President Harding accurately interpreted the results of the recent Congressional elections, which carried a rebuke to the party of which he is tile leader. Many Senators and Representatives who rarely indorse Mr. Harding's policies did not hesitate to express their approval of the address delivered by him in the House of Representatives this afternoon. General approval, and in some Instances genuine enthusiasm, followed some of the President's statements. The reading of the address itself marked an epoch. It was broadcast through amplifiers and by wireless to the ears of more persons than ever before listened at one time to a human voice In the history of the world. At phaslzcd by flattering applause at no less than twenty-seven periods. I Tone Surprises I naoritrnta. The tone of the address was t-urprlsing and disconcerting to some of, I the groups legislatively catalogued as [ Insurgent or radical. The feature of .the message which appeared to And the greatest lndoraement among Democratic aR well as Republican legislators was Its entire freedom from comment and direct recommendations. It was a narrative of active, concrete and definite facts and conditions and Instanced the most satisfactory form of true reporting. There was In it no suggestion of partisanship, of political log rolling, of half disclosed purposes, or of evasions from the true perspective. This at least Is the consensus of legislative opinion. Therefore the message did not provoke so wide a divergence of legislative estimate as Is usually the case. The President mo\ ed to the business of interpreting political, economic, foreign and social conditions as they actually exist with something approaching grim determination. The many nrw llnei* in hln fare told an eloquent tale of the difficulties and complexities that make his official life anything but a bed of roses. Xfn Reactionary V<rm. His almost solemn manner of dellrerlng his message portrayed more accurately than could liave spoken word hla full appreciation of the seriousness of the problems that now confront his party, to which the people look for solution. It was quite apparent before the President had progressed very far in reading his report of national condi; tlons that the Insurgent groups lid not expect so marked and deliberate a departure from the arbitrary, reactionary and orthodox partisan views which Mr. Harding has been credited with holding. Some of the Senate and House critics of the President expected a "hard bolted" message that would provide them with ammunition for their Insurgent and radical ambitions therefore raised their eyes when the President at almost the very outset of his message said: "If the sober snd deliberate appraisal of prewar civilization makes it seem a worth while inheritance, then with patience and good courage It wtM be preserved. There never again will l?e precisely the old order; Indeed, I know no one who thinks it to be de *lrnble. For out of the old order came the war Itself. and a new order, establlehed and made aecure. never will permit Ita recurrence."
