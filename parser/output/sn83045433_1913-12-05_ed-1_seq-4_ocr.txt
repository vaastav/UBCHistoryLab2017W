In his address before the tenth an nual convention of the Rivers and Harbors Congress, now holding its sessions, in Washington, Representative J. Hampton Moore, of Pennsylvania, made a ery illuminating speech upon the question of an intracoastal canal. This idea is not a new one. It has been discussed from time to time ever since the founding of the American nation. Among the papers of Alexander Hamilton is found a suggestion that such an inland waterway be estab lished Hamilton sajs The most useful assistance, perhaps, which it is 'in the power of the legis lators to give to manufactures and which at the same time will equally benefit the landed interests and com mercial interests is the improvement of inland navigation. Three of the easiest and most important operations of this kind which occur at this time arc the improvement of the communi cation between New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and Boston, bv cutting a passage through the peninsula of Cape Cod. the union of Delaware and Ches , apeake Bajs by a canal trom the waters of the former to those of the latter and the junction of the Chesapeake Bay and Albemarle Sound by uniting the Elizabeth and the Pasquotauk riv ers With the increase of trade along the Atlantic coast such a canal would un questionably be of great value to the commercial and industrial interests of the United States It would be of more than local interest. With the in crease of trade due to the opening of the Panama Canal, will come the in creased need of such a waterwaj. On account of the expense it may not be possible in the near future to realize Mr. Moore's dream of a canal "from Boston to the Florida Kevs," but some steps should be taken toward the im provement of coastal navigation. Wrapped and Standard Bread. NecesMtj for a law providing that bread offered for sale in the District of Columbia shall be wrapped ade quately to protect it from contamina tion while in transit from the baker to the consumer is again before Con gress The District Commissioners, in their recommendations to Congress, did not, it is true, advocate the wrap ping of bread; they stated merely that "there i a demand for regulations governing the weight, quality, and manner of deliver of bread in the District and the superintendent recom mends legislation giving the Commis sioners power in the premises,'' the superintendent'' referred to being the superintendent of weights and meas i. tires But i ust as Congress has often not djne things which the Commis sioners recommended them to do, and has often done things which the Com missioners recommended them not to do so, in this case, perhaps, wc need not despair that Congress will do a thing which the Commissioners did not recommend them to do, offering no counsel or petition whatever on behalf of the people of the District. Even with the matter thus negatively treated therefore, there is no reason to lose hope that Congress, either by the enactment of legislation already in troduced, or bj the enactment of an en tirely new bill, will secure the people against unwholcsomeness and fraud in the bread tliev eat Pure materials, hjgienic manufacture, clean deliver, full weight, those are the essentials of honest bread, and the people when buing this, their prime necessity, should be guaranteed of them all. If the prices charged for bread by the bakers of the District should prove, under the desired restriction, insuffi cient to afford them th: fair profit to which every citizen is entitled for his labor and Ins capital, the bakers should be, and without doubt, will be, per mitted to charge larger prices propor tionate to their increased expenses of manufacture and delivery. The people want honest and clean bread of a standard weight and are willing to pay for it President Wilson says in his message that the, country is very impatient for the new currency measure. We wonder whether he is as well informed on this point as he u on most matters. Secretary McAdoo the other day also intimated that he saw the same signs of impatience oyer the THE failure to rush a banking'' bill through. No one has greater 

COUNTRY respect for the utterances o these two gentlemen tnan we bare. NOT And they ought to hare access to accurate information. Curi- IMPATIENT ously enough the information which comes to us, and which we had been thinking was accurate, is -i'e the contrary. Of course we peruse very carefully all our exchanges, v . napers from eTery part of the country; we talk with Congressional reprei a itei from many different districts; we chat with numberless visitors whe throng Wash" ington from every part of the country. Their well-nig.. ifersJ opinion is not that the country is in a fever of impatience for a new currency measure, but that the country will be mighty impatient if it fails to get a safe and sound and thoroughly workable measure. Of course here and there you will find somebody writing in that his com munity u in a hurry for a new banking bilL But such testimony is, so far as we have been able to find out, both casual and in. equent People tell us that the way the country feels is like this: It has worked along THEY for a matter of about fifty years now, ever since the national WANT IT system was established, under the existing though faulty con SAFE AND ditions, and would much rather worry along for three or six SOUND months longer, if, by so doing, at the end of that time it can rely upon having a new currency system that is sound both theoretically and practically, in place of a patch-work quilt, which may result from these rush tactics in the Senate. The information that we get is that many merchants are genuinely alarmed at this announced decision that the Senators are going to work like fury, day and night, on the problem. These people are afraid, just as we pointed out in our editorial last week, that to force a jury decision on a problem of such complexity is a mighty dangerous expedient Therefore, Mr. Senator, and Mr. President, too, please don't get a wrong impression of what the country at large wants. Don't let a few let ters from here and there stir you up to thinking that they are typical of the community. There is another point: If general business in this country is letting up, as it seems to be, this letting up is not, for a minute, due to fear, of delay in impending currency legislation. Secretary McAdoo seems to have inferred that this letting up is due to a curtailing of credit With all 

CREDITS due respect in the world, we are confident that the alert See NOT retary is mistaken. Manufacturers and merchants are today UNDULY securing all their reasonable credit requirements. Last spring CURTAILED and early summer the money situation looked pretty serious. All the European banking centers were jamming down the brakes very hard, because of the Balkan war complications, and the constant need for enormous sums over there. They not only could not loan American enterprises any money, but they raised their rates so as actually to force America to grant credits to Europe. But that difficult situation of last sum mer has largely disappeared. There has been a decided ease in money in America in the last ninety days, and the apprehension which was very prop erly felt by the whole community six months ago has almost disappeared the apprehension, that is, as to a money stringency. Consequently, the busi- j neu let-up is not due to lack of credit facility. If we end this editonal right here, we shall be sure tomorrow morning to receive a lot of letters to the editor signed by "Constant Reader," and ask ing us to tell what the let-up in business is due to. Therefore, we might as well tell our friends now that there are a number of reasons. TARIFF One of them, of course, is because of the changes in the tariff. CHANGES We sympathize with those changes, and anyway everybody ONE knew beforehand that tariff reductions were bound to create CAUSE some temporary unsettlement in business; so we might just as well be philosophical as to this particular reason for a let-up, and not wring our hands over it A lot of woolen mills have shut down; many others have had to curtail their output; there are half a dozen other industries that have had a ""crimp" put in them by the tariff reduction, and, therefore' it is not wonder that this has a manifest effect on business. Another reason is that manufacturing and commerce have been moving at a fairly rapid rate for the last three years, and something of a let-up is not unnatural. If you will look at those wavy lines that statisticians prepare on the fluctuations of trade, you will see that we are about due for a little dip in the wave. Still another reason is that all Europe is still holding aloof from Ameri can enterprises. This doesn't mean that we haven't enough money to carry on our regular business properly; on the contrary, as we have explained above, the supplies of credit are sufficient But it does mean that there is not a lot of money available for new enterprise and for all the sort of things that serves to keep busmess lively and booming. But, in our judgment, the greatest single factor of all is the uncertainty which business men and investors feel in the future of American securities. You can put that in a nut shell in this way: The net earnings of American railways are steadily decreasing, dividends are being reduced LACK OF and even imperiled altogether, and the margin of safety over CONFI- actual interest requirements is constantly becoming thinner. DENCE No wonder, then, that investors shy at puttinr their monev in American railway securities. And when they fail to do this. and when it consequently seems that the railroads are no longer enabled to carry out needed extensions and improvements, that, of course, means a let-up in business. In similar manner with reference to American industrial corporations, the investors are equally timid. They are fearful that the present administration is going to continue the old policy of wrenching apart these great business units, which, without discussion as to the Sherman anti-trust act, have 

FEARFUL nevertheless proved efficient machines of manufacture, and conie OF A quently safe and profitable sources of investment for the Amer- SMASH ican people. We don't intend here to draw ourselves into a POLICY discussion of the trust question, and it is without prejudice that we simply say that in the eyes of the American public, the corporate future of these great units is, by reason of possible government action, so dubious that they are inclined to withhold investment from other enterprises, fearing that all sorts of business are to be attacked and torn to pieces. President Wilson has on almost every occasion possible given assurances that the intentions of the administration on this matter are conservative and with an eye to business interests. He said so again very THE concisely in his message of Dceember 2. But something more 

PRESIDENTS than these assurances is needed to make the American in. ASSURANCES vestor feel comfortable on this point That something is an actual policy of conservatism pursued over a period of months, and that is what we are hoping both Congress and President Wilson will With the Political Procession. J. Henry docks Is one member of the Ohio Democratlo delegation In Congress who comes back lo business hoping- that his district will be given a big Federal appointment before New Year's Day. Goeke Is modest, but not timid, and ha has taken hold of Congressional business In a way that has appealed to his district hitherto Inclined to tbe "two terms and out' folly, so that he promises to break the hoodoo and show what a Congress man can accomplish If given the chance. The patronage proposition that Interests Ooeke Just now la the possible appoint ment of Judge Hugh T. Mathers on the Interstate Commerce Commission. The Judge is from Sidney, and before going on the bench was active enough In poll tics to please the most fastidious, and dangerous enough to give Congressional candidates much to think about every four years. In fact, when the word passed that Judge Mathers would appreciate the appointment on a big Federal commlislon, other ambitious Democrats In the district breathed easier-and approved Senator Pomerene's demand for the Mathers se lection. It might mean much for Goeke to have so Important a place given his district, and It Is not forgotten that Antberry, In the adjoining district, rejoiced In the selec tion of SalzKOber as Pension Commis sioner very early In the Wilson admin istration. Ohio has never had a mem ber of the Interstate Commerce Com mission, and it seems about time for so great a State to connect with such an Important body In an official way. Besides the Goeke congressional dis trict has not been milch In other years of Democratic domination at Washing ton, even though Senator Brice was pow erful during the last Cleveland term.
