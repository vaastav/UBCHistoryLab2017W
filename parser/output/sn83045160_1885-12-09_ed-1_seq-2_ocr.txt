THE MEMPHIS DAILY APPEAL-WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1885. J MMPHIS appeal. WEDNESDAY, t : : DECEMBER 9, J.8S5 TBI BtJrUHKSS SITUATION. In its clearing statement for the week ending November 28th, the New York Chronicle says that the slight diflerence made In the bank clearings by Thanks giving day saggeet farther and pretty general improvement in mercantile trans actions. The five days showed a total gain over the same time in 1884 of 51.7 per cent, or excluding New York of 36.6 per cent. Chicago had a gain over the same time in 1884 of 29.9 per cent., Cincinnati of 9.7. St. Louis of 17.7, New Orleans of 10.7, Louisville of 11.6, Kansas City of 59.6, Memphis of 0.7. It will be noticed that New Orleans makes the best report it has been able to exhibit for a long time. Money in New York last week was slight ly easier at from 2) to 2j per cent, for bankers' balances, with a renewed ten dency toward accumulation, and but little inquiry for crop purposes. The Chronicle says of the foreign exchange market: "With such con ditions prevailing in our breadstuff's market ; with cotton exports very much restricted (exports in November being 111,000 bales lees than in November, 1884) ; with imports increasing materially ; with the rates f?r money declining here and remaining at 2 per cent, on sixty days to three months' bills in the open market at London; and with capital shun ning us thrdffgh a vague fear of adverse action by Congress respecting silver coin agethere seems no reason for being sur prised at the position of the foreign ex change market. Its course has been just as the advocates of a sound currency have anticipated all along. Those who, de pending upon the ordinary cause aud effect, have been looking for gold imports fiad themselves disappointed; while those who recognized that the natural commercial currents were wholly deranged by an influence that affects every value, throwing out of gear all the ordinary ma chinery for the interchange of commodi ties, see their opinions justified." On Fri day the rates for foreign exchange were again advanced and are 481 for long and 486 for short sterling. The demand for money for moving crops a demand that absorbed the idle supply of silver certifi cates, lowering the amount of them paid at the custom-bonne has about ceased, consequently a largor proportion of silver certificates is now pouring into the custom-house. The proportion of silver certificates paid in there in September was only 9 3-10 per cent., which roue in Octo ber to 11 310, in November to 13i )fr cent., an increase which! is satisfactory when compared with 42 1-6 per cent, silver payments in November, 1S84, and 41 3 10 percent as late as April last. The strength of the Treasury has increased during the last month, for on the first of this month there was a net gain over the 1st of November in gold and its equiv alents ol $3,04,406, although dur ing that time government puirl the banks $o,91 5,000 for that amount of subsidiary currency taken up. which shows that the government 1 an still full control of the situation. I'ut during this t!ct no payment is making c( the national debt, although there is prg sure from some quarters in favor of bond calls. To be able to make such cfi!' without injury to financial and commer cial affairs is what the Treasury is aiming at. When it resumes bond calls it must do so safely, for our industries cannot thrive if there is the least uncertainty bs to the power of the government to biir Jain itself on a gold basis. A call cannot wise.'y be mivle, except in view of soma exigency in the money market, until the heavy payhents at New Year's are mi-t. If Congress suspend the coinage of sil ver, releasing $2,000,000 a month that :'a now abstracted from the jeveirtie, it will help to give the Treasury power to call in bonds. TIiub silver that does ol circu late holds out of circulation money i!t, if bonds were pa'ul off with it, wuttld cir culate. The price of silver in London is firm at 47. which makes the bullion value rf the standaid dollar, at the cur rent rate of exchangp, which is about 0 0.,ri35 cents, or a very little overs4 cents. The New Yot Bulletin remarks that tilt? first week in December is not ninalb a very active one in wholesale business, I 1 1 there is u" complaint of la-t week, p.ud probably nrj ."prsoii fur any. Pry bhi.iIs were active; "tup prices realized have been satisfactory, st'.a tho itittiiliution nil that could bn desired.''

Sugars are Btronner; i oflee has a better tone ; groce ries generally are steady and fairly active; there is a good trade in pig iron, with fur ther large contracts, and in metals gener ally. Leather is active, the jobbing du tritMitions good and the exports )ar.

Whea', according to the XeV York Chroniile, was active, but hampered by tHe enormous visible supply, with prui above the Liverpool equivalent, while the bhutting up of the Minneapolis mills closes the present demand thero. Altogether, circumstances in the wl at market appear to be going more and more agaitft holders, who hold their grip, how ever, as loug as there is a probability of war in Europe. Compared w it h a year ago, t tie volume of legitimate hnnnifa must have improved considerably, and if advance in price? indicates activity in trade we are certainly doing well. Bm.i Urttf't report a fairly satisfactory condi tion of general trade, rith a moder te movement, as the approach of stock taking prevents buyers taking freely, out dealers remain confident as to the future. Mo.-e favorable weather for the season has helped the wholesalers. Taking these various reports together, the pi as pect continues to mend, but much i!e pends upon the action of Congress. THE illTEA 

KTATKN TBEAMVRY RCrtlHl. In the present state of business, when a Congress has just met that mu6t act upon business questions, the report msrle to Congress by the Secretary of "he Treasury becomes a document of mure than ordinary significance. After giv tig the usual tabular statement of receipts nd expenditures, Mr. Manning explains, in connection with the sinking fund for : he reduction of the United States debt, Hint it is proposed, in determining the amount to be applied to the fund, to aggregate with it the coin and currency certificates held in the Treasurer's cash, as well as the cash in the Treasury held Co.- the reduction of the debt and from other sources, and to deduct them from the outstanding principal of the debt, but to add to the debt the bonds issued ti the several Pacific railroads. Chanees. during the year ending with October leave a reduction in that time of $309,.VnX The silver dollars and certificates, the re pott says, have greatly increased the labor of the Treasury employes. The report shows also that vanons important sums that, from o.ie reason or another, nre charged against tu Treasury but not held by it, ought no longer Ja reckoned against it, and the Treasurer sei" that Congress authorise the discontinuance o rt- tom, Mr. Manning calls attention to the grave need of ref jrm in our currency and taxation, both the legacies of war. The very prosperity of the country has allowed the continuance of abuses that, under other circumstances, would be unbear able, bat our unwise financial policy h a abridged our prosperity to an intol erable degree. Reform is wan'ed, evils should not be supported simp'y because we have become nsed to them, and be cause custom is making disorder into a kind of order, so that "the mixture of pri vate joos ana past public needs in our tariff are regarded as a system of protection to public labor." The first reform required is that of the currency. The Bland act overloads the mints with unused and returned silver dollars, and they "will unavoidably convert the funds of the Treasury into those depreciated and de preciating coins;" such are the report's striking and accurate words. The act of May, 1878, the Treasurer says, in definitely postponed the fulfilment of the pledge of March, 1869, and required the issue and re-issue of promises to pay. The reform that is needed, the report declares, must not disturb trade ; must neither decrease nor increase the value of the monetary unit; must be without loss to those holding United States obligations; without reducing the present volume of the currency or hinder ing its required growth hereafter; without suspending the payment of the national debt, or increase of taxation, or the sale of the silver bought by the Treasury ; with out giving up the use of or discounting the current value of the coined silver dol lars; without the disuse of the present legal tender ; without prejudice to a future bimetallic union, and with free coinage of metals to all who bring them at a fixed ratio of weight and for unlimited legal tender; with the coins of both metals as sociated, whatever the market price of silver may be, after the Treasurer has ceased to buy it. With these conditions in view the Treasurer commends a consid eration of the subject of reform by Congress as just, advantageous, bene ficial to labor and trade, stopping the pur chase of silver bullion, and retiring legal tender notes. The report approves of paper money that is a certificate of actual coin in the Treasury. Demonetisation is of a matter of degree the use of metal to a limited or to an indefinite extent, and nearly all nations favor two-metallism, using silver at least in fractional coin, while bimetailists, although desiring a larger use of silver, do not desire to pro hibit gold. There must, however, be an established ratio between the two, but no law can cross the boundaries of nations, and those who do not conform the ratio to the established ratio will be drained of one of the two metals. . Bimetallism depends upon a fortuitous balance of metals, or upon an agreement among nations as to the ratio of weight. Germany upset the bimetal agreement. Two attempts to re store it have failed, and the only course left is to do as France has done, stop a coinage that is unacceptable to other na tions. "The United Rtates must stop coining silver;" such is tbe expressed ver dict of the Treasury report. We must negotiate, and, whether we suc ceed or fail in that, we must et )p at the point where the risk begins to appear of difficulty of maintaining our silver at an equivalence with gold. Silver is indispensable in currency, but gold is the medium of value between the na tions, and France and other bimetallic nations have had to come to it to prevent the fall of the silver already coined. Uoid isby law the standard ot value in the do mestic trade of the United States, under the act of Congress of March, 1873, and it is 66 per cent, of our present circulation, yet in eighty years, during which any owner of silver could have it coined, in that time only 8,045,838 silver dollars were made, but now Congress requires 215,000, 000 df Iheru to bs coined in eight years. Gold is the standard of value by which last year the United States received 87 per cent, of its imports and sent away 92 per cent, of its exports. Kven whero countries have a silver etandaid we usually settle by gold standard through London sterling bills. Gold has doubled in quantity the last thirty-five years, silver' has about doubled in 100 years, and tho principal product of the L'nited States is gold. Why, then, should we seek to forsaka its use or put it up to a premium, rather than make it a standard to which the 215, 000,000 of silver dollars we have coined shall be maintained? Those 215,000,0o0 cnjiot te exported, will nut pay to melt, are not taken abroad, and can be kept in circulation at 100 cenisonl;' by making no more, .of them, for evert in manuuctuio they will not be acceptable; they will do for nothing but circulation, therefore their current rate must be sustained and we be binielalSibts. Tbe report goes on to show tbe relations of bimetallism and monometallism and shows that both sus tain theories not applicable to our present monetary condition, for we have $50,000, 000 of gold and $215,000,000 of silver currency to look after and sustain. Mr. Manning directly asserts: "I cannot my self believe the voters of the several Stat-s will ever decide that their Federal government holds as sovereign a power to issue ana reinsue Treasury notes and make them a legal tender in payment of private debts, as it has lo uoia and borrow money." The report gives a valuable ta ble with references Jo history and foreign usage which throws a light upon our mon etary system that would deliver from many errors now sincerely maintained, if it could but be generally appropriated. The footing of gold and silver among the nations, tlie report goes cu to say, leaves to Congress only the jchoice between oiiS metal ism and two-metalittiti, lor if the coinage is continued the silver dollar can not be kept equal to the gold one, and if silver falls below gold the gold will be bought up end carried off, leaving only one-metalism In w tjjer case. If coining silver dollars be Continued their current value will fall. The pro posal to put more silver into tha dollar is vain, they are uperabupi',rt now; to make heavier ones would mlT more to a circulation already overdo: o, and it would require more of the methl already superabundant in circulation to he bonght. To make more dollars, and of a heavier weight, would cause the dollars to circulate oa the base of their bullion value, and our stock of dollars would lore their current value. To stop the coinage will not affect the laborer's wages, to allow the dollar to go to s discount will. This report is what reports very raiely are, in teresting to read. The luminous array cf facts, and the obvious but important con clusions drawn from them, arouse and sustain the reader's attention. 

JEWISH oisprrE asd chriktiai NPE I I.ATIOXK. There are no better, more law-abiding or more generous people in the United States than our iollow-citizons of the Jewish faith a people who. in everv nation in the world, have been promi nent for their marked ability. The Jews have been a persecuted people for cen turies, persecuted not only for their re ligion but also for their superior success in business, for men "hate the excel lence they cannot reaoh." Persecution his been a pressure from without, forc ing union among themselves, as the hoops hold together the individual parts of the barret. The consequence hs been the absence, in a great measure, of prominent and open disputes and divis ions among the Jews such as disgrace most prosperous and religious denomi nations. The liberal and tolerant spirit of this country, however, has re moved the pressure of persecution, and the consequence is that among tbe American Jews re ligious disputation and division are making their appearance, aud the synagogues are shaken, and sometimes disrupted, by the differences existing be tween ' orthodox and "reform" Jews. Tfca former cling to old traditions, forms and ceremonial. Tbe latter cast off what they consider to be mere accre tions that ages and th sharp exigencies of persecution have cemented around the grand kernel of truth which is the glory ot the Jew, and whose principles tend to elevate and purify humanity in every land under heaven. Admitting that re form was necessary, how far it would go and what it should leave untouohed, are questions that demanded discussion, and, especially in religious questions, dis cussion becomes disputation, and dispute only too commonly leads to division The orthodox accuse the reformed of having carried changes to far, rnuti lating the sacred aro where dwells divine truth. Many of the , reformed Jews have absorbed deeply the natural istic philosophy of the present age, and their adversaries strongly condemn what they call their rationalistic theories, Two or three weeks ago there was held at Pittsburg a conference of Jewish rab bis who put forth a sort of confession of faith, suoh as they considered required by the spirit of the present age and the position and sentiments of Jews in the United States. The ereed so put forth meets with strong opposition, not only from the orthodox but even such a con firmed rationalist as Dr. Felix Adler, one of the most able Jews in this coun try, who criticises with some seventy the "new departure," What may be ths result only time can tell, but the exi gence is one that was sure to arise when intelligence was spread and intolerance ceased to be vindictive. Many Chris tians, strong in the belief that the Mes siahship of Jesus will one day be aeknowl edged by the Jews, regard the dispute as a beginning of events that will result in the most momentous consequences They regard the attitude of the Pitts burg reform rabbis as a negative assault upon J adaism as it has been, denying many of its affirmations, and they specu late upon a reformed affirmative as sure to come ultimately, which will recognize Jesus as the originator and true leader of a Jewish reform that will mature into Christian excellence. Many Christians extend their speculations still further, and believe that when the Jew joins the Gentile iu Christian faith, he will pro test against the deviations of the churches from the teaebini s of the divine rabbi, and insist that His mandates shall be obeyed, and that the J ewish regard for the poor and the unfortunate, and for "good fruits" rather than an empty call ing of "Lord, Lord," in. a devotion that is made a substitute for goodness, shall be obeyed to the letter as the Jew Jesus taught and required. lXOCCLATlOar FOB tellow-fitek Scientists have for some years been experimenting with a view to discover a meaDs of preventing epidemics as small pox is pi evented, by the use of inocula tion in some form. In some cases very promising results have been obtained among animals, especially by M. Pasteur, the great French experimentalist, who is confident that he has discoverd a way of counteracting the effects of a bite from a mad dog. It was believed during the late cholera epidemic in Spain that by mooulation with cholera microbes a means of preventing that disease had been discovered, but the results were so unsatisfactory that a commission of med ical examiners pronounced the attempt a failure. Much attention has been ex cited by an inoculation process employed by Dr. Friere, in connection with yellow fever, aud which has produced striking results in Mexico and South America. The New Orleaus Picayunewstu. "From all the information at hand it is evident that the experiments at inoculation for yellow-fever are not without good results, and the testimony is very strong to show that a remedy against this dreaded dis ease has been found ac last." So strik ing hav-e been the results Dr. Friere has obtained that Dr. Holt, the president qj the Board of Health of New Orleans, has recommended that a commission be sent from the United States to places where the Friere inoculation has been applied during yellow fever epidemics, so. that, il occasion should unhappily arise, our own country may profit by the discovery. The Cotton Exchange of New Orleaus has formally expressed its approbation of Dr. Holt's proposition, which, no doubt, will be carried out on application to Congress to supply the means to do so. Tbe matter is cne ot national importance in view of the public health and of the requirements of trade. To the people of the lower Mississippi aud of the whole Southern coast it is one of supreme in terest. 

'BATTLE OP THE STANDARDS." Mr. Edward Atkinson on tbs A I leered Scarcity of Gold. Ngw York, December 7- In Bradurrrtt of Saturday, Mr. Edward Atkinson writes at length on the subject of tbe alleged scarcity of sold. Mr. Atkinson takes the vieu that in spite ot assertions to the con trary, the volume of the money metals iu circulation in the world, especially tbe volume of gold, has increased since 1849 in a much greater ratio than has tbe popu lation of ths wor'd during the same time. From an examination of the statistics available, Mr. Atkinson arrives ac the con clusion that, while the population has in creased about 40 per cent, in the period mentioned, tbe increase in tha volume of the money metals has been fully 100 per cent,, and that the value of the gold added Jo the cn.u;?ticn during mat period was more tha? doubie U-st of the silver added. These consideration ? jpnt forrrd for the ben.6t of those who, like SvBenator nut ot tJoiorado, assume that the ques tion which overshadows all others in the "battle cf the standards'"' is that of the volume of money, and who profess to fear an abridgment of tbe quantity of the circulating medium. Mr. Atkinyon holds that the contention of the bimetal iats, so called, for tbe necessary continued use of silver as a f nil legal-tender metal cannot be sustained by any evidence tnd- Ihb . ProvB mat mere is an insumcieucy of gold tue've the average need of the existing poiiti.tri- Mr- Atkinson takes the ground in his extK if? there can be no contest bet een the ingie fcin-.arn and bimetalism, because bimei.i?l as suming that term to mean the use of bom gold and silver as money metals exists in the nature of things, and, as regards by far the greater proportion of tbe world's transactions, caunot be affected by legal leader and bi-legal tender, and Mr. Atkin son points oat that it would conduce greatly to clearness to have that fact recognized in current discussions on the silver question. CRUSHED TO DEATH. Aaotkor FbIkI Aoeldeat la' tn (JrMI Sew Yrk IqMdnrl. Mkrritt's Cob.viks. N. Y.'. December 7. Another accident has happened on the new croton aqueduct. It occurred early this morning at shaft No. 3, and resulted in the death of four men and the prob able fatal injur v of a fifth. The men were descending to work in one of the buckets used for lowering them down the shaft. The start was made all right, but before the bucket has descended many feet the cross-beam, or "billv." as it is called, caught in the shaft and' remained last until the bucket had almost reached the bottom of the shaft, when it shook loose and came crashing down a distance of over 100 feet on the heads of the un fortunate men. Tbe following men were instantly killed: 'Francis Uarr, single; Frederick Dresser, single; Lorenxo Dob bins, married, who leaves a wife and fam ily at Hibernia, N. J.; Patrick Morsn, married. John Boardman, the other un fortunate man, will probably die of his injuries. When the cross-beam struck the bucket he was knocked out, but in his descent fell on a shelving constructed near the bottom and on the side of the shaft. This, in all probability, saved him Irom instant death. Heavy Jewelry Robbery. Chicago, Ilu, December 8. The jewelry store of . N. Marks A Co., 103 Adams street, was entered bj burglars last night, the vault drilled, the safe broken open, and watches and diamonds valued at $6000 to $8000 carried off. The job was most cleverly done, bo far there is no clew to the thieves. Several detectives have been put to work on the case.

The Silver Men Greatly Annoyed at Mr. Cleveland's Opposition to the Standard Dollar. Free- Traders and Protectionists Both Claiming; the President for Their Own Congressional. fanciAL to ths iprtu..! . Washington. December 8. The mes sage is generally well received here and is considered a very able state document. The protectionists and tariff reformers both claim the President as essentially their own. The former, however, are best pleased because free traders are greatly disappointed that their theory was not adopted. Republicans speak of the tariff clause as being better consolation than the Democratic platform on this question. The The silver men are greatly disappoint ed at the President's opposition to the silver dollar. A prominent -Democrat and leading silver man said to-day regarding the policy of administra tion : It means no silver, no greenbacks, no sinking funds, a cordon of fortification about the country and a pension for every one. (Scarcely a member of the House left his seat during the first hour of the read ing of the message. Most of them paid very close attention, but as the reading went on the second hour the seats began to be vacated. Until long before it had been finished, the Clerk had his usually small audience on such occasions. The most horrible and indignant criticisms of the message in the corridor was oc casioned by its complete failure to make reference to the necessity for Mississippi river or other river and harbor im provements. This criticism will be fully met by the announcement that the work of river and harbor improvements is to be the subject of a special meBsaee at an early day, in which the necessity for car rying on these works will be iorciby set forth. The Evening Mar, an Independent journal, says : "The message throughout is characteristic of Mr. Cleveland. It is a clear and explicit declaration of his views, and allows no man to mistake them in any particular."

Sanches with fifty men from Sabi- nars, Cof. Carlos lengnal with 10U men from Lampasas, and several small par ties from ranches. A night attack was expected, and the entire command was kept in readiness with saddled horses until daylight, when scouts brought in the news that the revolutionists were camped in force at Paola Blanco ranche, eighteen miles south. A courier from Monterey reports that at midnight fifty revolutionists marched to the public plaza in that city and fired several vol- ey in the air. The mavor called on Gen. Reyes, commander of the Federal troops, loraUnce, fhieh wM refused. Ihe, police succeeded in arresting eight oi the offenders. After quiet was restored, Geo. Reyes detailed troops to watch the city.

TWO MORE LIVES LOST By Another Accident In tbe Sew Croton Aqueduct Works. MerrittV Corners, December 8. Two more victims are added to the long list of unfortunates who have met their death at the new Croton Aqueduct Works at this place. Both were itatarjt ly killed this morning while at work at the head of the tunnel. One of the men is Herbert Farrington, o young man, and the manner of his death was most horrible. Ue had just descended shatt No. 4, and was preparing to go to work, when a huge fragment ot rock becoming detached from the roof of the tunnel, fell upon his head, crushing him into a shapeless mass. The rock weighed fully 600 pounds, and when removed a ghastly and sickening spectacle presented itself. The man's head was crushed to a jelly, and every bone in his' body was broken. The other victim met his death in the tunnel at a point known as Zero, within a short distance of Croton Lake. His name has not been ascertained. Since the construction of the aqueduct began thirty-eight men ' have lost their lives in connection therewith. THE WHISKY WAK AT ATLANTA. The Injunction Case Before the Federal Court.

The de fendants maintain that the claimant is not the eon of Geo. Peck and not entitled to share in the estate. Who he is they do not say. They admit that Geo. Pack did convey all his estate to his mother, bnt deny that she secured it by fraud. On the nnai settlement oi nis lather s estate ueo. Peck, sr., appeared before the County Court and notified it of the conveyance to his mother. On March 3d, they claim, his wife, Margaret, filed a bid in which she averred that her husband. Geo.

To ths Editors of the Appeal : Hernando, Miss., December 7. Gentle men : i read your article in Saturday i Appkal on SouthernAirricultnral Labor. Allow me to thank you for the generous and intelligent suggestions therein. Al though not a colord man, I belong to the class of Southern agricultural laborers. V ith an experience of nine years on Southern farm. I must say there is much room for improvement, especially in the direction your suggestions point. In the meantime 1 will say little of the colored laborer. I may say I have been closely connected witn mm, as a lei low hireling, also on tbe share svstem. I have found almoet invariably that he very much dis likes to hire for wages for any lengthy pe- nou. n win mre oy tne day, sometimes by the month, but very seldom for a year. x nave ortea aexed them the reason of this. if they give any reason at all it is mostly this: If I hire by the year I can't get away if I want a holiday or have a little Dusiness to attend to ; got to work in the rain, in the cold and in the long hot days in summer when everybody else has gone fishing, and then very uaeiy get notning at tne end ot the year, a am a single man, and my nrst experi ence on a Southern farm was raisins cot ton on the shares we call it "keeping Dacn mat ;is l aid my own cooking and lived in a little cabin by myself. I started in March, with $22 in cash, and at Christ mas started ont with about thirty bushels ot cotton-seed lor my snare ol the crop. But the farmers here refer to that year as the year of the flood. I felt a little dis couraged, and was about to abandon South ern farming, when a neighboring farmer asxed me one day what my intentions were for next year. I had a slight ac quaintance with him, and thought him good, square sort of man. I knew him to be a member of the church, and that he prayed very loud and very long, and I be lieved he would do what he said he would. He made me an offer of a stipulated sum if I would hire to him for the year, no deduction for anything, unless in the event of a protracted sickness. I was not sick. Well, I hlled the contract, but the settlement was far from satisfactory to me. iis excuses were: wen, you was not such a worker as I thought you was. You did not do much after the crop was laid by, You lost several half days." and so on. However, I was glad to settle with him on his own terms, which was some S2'J lees than he agreed to pay me. I bad to take his note for what he was willing to pay me, aud had to give that to a lawyer for collection, which made it $5 less. Very dis couraging on Denau ot tbe year system : nevertheless, I have Btuck to it with the exception of one year, and I find it suits me best, as it secures a home for a while, at least. You say in your article : "They I. tue iarmerej must also see mat the labor- is contented, by attention to his comforts and welfare." I am sorry to say that the almost total neglect ol his comforts and wtlfare is the cause of much discontent on the part of the laborer. In some places I have had to take a quilt to the cotton-house to sleep there "till we get a place fixed for you" (which took all the year to fix). In some other places I had to go to the barn or some rickety old ctbin, half full of potatoes. peae.old barrel?, piows or oin iurniture, sometimes without a fireplace. I ou say also if Southern farm ers desire satisfactory labor thev must look for it elsewhere than from icnorance. No a you hit the mark, bnt my experience teaches me that the intelligence of the la borer does not receive the appreciation it deserves. In some cases, where the farmer is a man of intelligence himself, it A ...w. V : . i. . i : . . . . uunro, uu, wuu iuu uiujuruy it uoes not. When some of the progressive farmers get an improved implement yon may ask them. "Well, won t it take a man with good judgment to run it?" They will tell ycu, "Oh, no: lean take any man and in haf a day I can learn him how to run it." One of these know-it-all fellows, you know. And let me tell vou. I have lived with but one man who was a regular subscriber to agricultural literature of any description. I have had them tell me, "So, no, no book farming in mine. Now if some man has made a SDecial study of raising peaches, another of graprs, another of potatoes, another of corn, atid so on through the various agricultural products, who is there, I ask, so well able to tell us how to do it as well ss how not to do it, especially if their study has been conducted with intelligence and means ? And yet it is only a short time ego since farmers themselves were quite indifferent to the assistance which scientific investi gation offered them. Let the farmer con- aider, for instance, the principles of stock breeding, lhe stock breeder has some clear and definite aim in view, and ought to understand the surest means of attain ing it. The experience of any one man will go but a little way toward acanirinc a knowledge of these principles: indeed. his whole lifetime without the assistance of ethers would fail to enlighten him. Hence I advocate the encouragement vi agricultural literature amonft touthei-n farmers, not only for his own and his family use, but ior the use of his hired man, and if he is alive to his own interest he will swap ideas with his hired man which may be of much ucucut w uuiu. iuu V BVBUn Dn your dignity, but get tqtri,l f 'tha fur, no once in awhile, and talk with him about par Corn, our oats and so on ; give him an interest in it ; ask him abont his wants, and his tastes for amusements,and give him acnanceto hear and see once in awhile. and in conclusion I will give you the key-note of his contentment, and thst is, make him dead certain sure of his wages whatever you may have promised him. and mnre especially if he had settlement troubles before you hired him, and my word for it if he is the rijht kind of man he will be worth more than you pay him. I hope you wi 1 not consider me tresDars- ing, but I have wanted to say something like this for a loDg time, and I hope you will think over it if you do not think it worth a place in your paper, again thank yon for your kindly interest.

TWENTY-THREE YEABS AGO. JL Meeting of Two of Forrest's Command Wbo Saw Service Toaetber. Fort Worth (Tex.) Gazette: Col Thomas W. Harris and Edwin Gholson of Holly Springs, Miss.,two able lawyers, have lately come to our city to locate anu practice their profession. Col. Har ris was art officer ot the rank mentioned in Gen. Forrest's famous command, and carries an empty sleeve in remembrance ot it. 1 he colonel was astonished yes terday to meet as old comrade here, one wno was also an omcer iu rorrs.-n s com mand, and one who, twenty-three years ago, was as dashing and brave a soldier as southern chivalry produced. This was Maj. T. B. Sheridan, well known in our city ss an old time journalist, who was in 1876and 1877 connected with the Standard in this city. The meeting was, in some respects, a sad one, and the major's eyes filled with tearsas heerasned -1 1 IT 1 1 . . tne uauu oi vol Harris, wno nad shared the toils, privations and dories of several campaigns, but the gentlemen were glad to meet once more. Col. Harris, a schol arly and courteous gentleman, related in a feeling manner to a reporter the cause of the major's present crippled condition. Maj. bhendan was in the frout line of battle, riding a eplendid horse, when a shell struck the horse and exploded, kill ing tbe animal and throwing the maior against a tree, injuring his right lee. The contact coming on the major's head came near killing him. Col. Harris says after the war was ended Gen. Forrest wa walkine on the streets ot Memnhia Un he saw Maj, Sheridan on the sidewalk, and. running to him. threw his arms around him and gave him a literal hug. ooin oia soiuiers are somewhat gray now, but it is hoped they will live long and prosper greatly before the last bugle call comes. Col. Harris enjoys splendid health,hut Maj. Sheridan has been almost an invalid for years. While the major would not ask alms, it would be a noble deed on the part of the soldiers of the Lost Cause whom God has prospered if during the coming Christian holiday season they presented him with a hand some testimonial. Surelv, the Southern people will never forget the gallant and heroic deeds of those whose hair in nnir silvered by the hand of time, of those health has been ruined thue facing those who at the tiiue were our enemies Our citizens will be glad to welcome Col!

There were nine flaur mills started yeater day, including the largest, as well as three of the smallest ones. Those mills have a capacity of about 16,000 barrels in twenty four hours, but it is not now possible to push them to that point. Whan the mills were opened it was found that owiDg to an ice gorge, or low stage of the river, the water drew down eeventy-eight feet and they could not all run. On this account tbe output will probably be limited to 6000 barrels per day for a short time. The number of cars of wheat in sight in Min neapolis yesterday included 1138 on side tracks in the city, ninety-eight on side tracks outside, and seventy-nine on mov ing trains due here in twenty-four hours, making a total of 1315.
