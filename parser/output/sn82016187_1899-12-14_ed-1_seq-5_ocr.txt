YESTERDAYS IN WASHINGTON Pen Pictures of Celebrities of the Past Generation Bj MARY S LOCKWOOD Copyrighted 1839 by Tue National Tbi bure SOCIAL PRECEDENCE IN OFFICIAL LIFE We learned from the previous letters official and otherwise that no definite code had been established which makes the Bocial laws as clear as tho official There nro certain laws of decorum which obtain in official circles but the rock on which society has floundered for nearly a cen tury still lifts its hydra head men and wo men may come and go but the feuds go on forever It was as recent as the Garfield Adminis tration that the wife of the Secretary of State Mrs Maine having recently emerged from ono official flock into another and probably having been obliged to taste of the bitter waters of Jlarali while a Sena tors wife called her official coterie around her and promulgated tiio new doctrine She not only declared in the new code that Senators wives must make the first calls on the ladies of the Cabinet but thereafter no Cabinet lady should return calls Society was on tiie qui vive to knowwho should conquer in this new passage at arms At last the Senatorial contingent were invited to hear their faie and a meet ing was called in the Xortliwest End The Senatorial ladies rebelled against theruling but ilrs Blaine was inexorable Finally Irs John A Logan who hud known Mrs Kobert Lincoln wife of the Secretary o War from a child turned to her and said Mary this glass house was peopled long before you were born one after an other the inmates have hal lo move out I advise you to do the same As to

The Honorable the Ujeretary of War elc In speak ing address a Cabinet officer as Mr Sec retary Tiie onlr of precedence in line at state receotons at the White House is regu late 1 by the bill of Presidential succession passed during the early part of the first Cleveland Administration which reads as follows In case of the removal death or in ability of bath the President and the Vice President of the United States the Secre tary of State or if there bo none or in case of his removal death resignation or in ability then the Secretary of the Treasury or if there be none or in case of his re moral death resignation or inability then the Secretary of War or if there be none or in case of his removal death resignation or inability then the Attorney General or in case of his removal death resignation or inability then the Secre tary of the Xavy or if there be none or in case of his removal death resignation or inability then the Secretary of the Interior shall act as President until the disability in removed or until the vacancy is other wise lawfully rilled such officer being eligible to the office of President under the Constitution and not under articles of impeachment by the House of Representa tives of the United States at the time the NH inn HVBb Owl aSSlBSW i mm i i ----ml Mrs James Monroe powers and duties of the office shall devolve upon him Prodded that whenever the powers and duties of the President of the Putted States shall devolve upon any of the persons named therein if Conirress he not then in session or if it would not meet regularly within 20 days thereafter it shall lie the duty of the iterson upon whom the said powers and duties shall dnvnlvn to issue a proclamation convening Con gress giving 20 days notice of the time of meeting It shall also 16 enacted that tho above shall only be held to apply to those officers who shall have licen appointed by the ad vice and consent of the Senate to the office therein named In these days of controversy it is well to give tho full text of the bill that an under standing of the succession could be well known It seems a useless discussion which is now going on who has precedence Gen Miles or Admiral Dewey It 1ms al ways been the custom that officers of De partments occupy relative positions ac cording to the order of the creation of the Departments of the Government This was strictly carried out in the bill of Presi dential succession Tho first Secretary of War was nomi nated and confirmed Sept 12 17S9 tho Attorney General Sept fi 1780 the first Postmaster General was appointed the same day Sept 20 178 tho firstSecretary of the Navy was appointed May s 17I8 nine years after the first Secretary of War and in this order would the renriisonnitii A of the Navy come in the line of succes sion It would hardly seem that the public need work themselves into a fever over ine precedence or lien Miles and Admiral Dewey Another question of social precedence that lias caused some vexation of soul To whom lielongs the second place in social precedence to the Chief Justice or to the Vice President This also will remain ono of the unsettled questions until the peoples parliament stops the occasion for bitter feuds Following tho Chief Justice and tho Vice President the Speaker of tho House Is an honorable contestant In former aays no was in lipe or the Presidential succession until 188U when the succession was turned through tho lino of Cabinet officers In case of the death of the - dent his place is filled by the Chairman pro tempore elected by the Scnnte The vacancy is not filled until another Presi dential election Tho trouble per so lias seemed to be tho order of precedence of tho Cabinet and Senate The argument of the superiority of the Senate over the Cabinet rests on the ground that the Senato represents State sovereignty therefore a more glori fied dignity clothc3 the Senator as tho Cabinet officer has to have his nomina tion confirmed by the superior liody the Senate and is annointed constitutional advisor and aid of tho President This argument however if used would place tho State Senator alxvc the United States Senator and the constitutency above the State Senator It would seem that a new dignity had robed tho Cabinet since their succession to the Presidency how far reaching it is in social precedency doth not yet var Another dilemma that has vexed the souls of entertainers is the precedence that exists between the Vice President and the Dean of the Diplomats Xot many years ago a high light in society gave a dinner party The Vice President was a guest and so was Sir Julian Tho hostess wishing to do honor to her foreign guest seated Sir Julian alxive the Vice-President The papers were not slow to toko it up The representative of the United States the man in succession to the Presi dency had lieon placed lielow it foreign Embassy the Minister of Great Hritain Embassadors were not known in this coun try at that time Mr Olney the Secretary of State was appealed to and he dtgnificdly settled tho controversy for that time by inviting tho same parties to dinner and giving to the Vice President tho most honored seat It is well understood that when a Cabinet officer or any official of the Government gives a public reception the doors are literaliy open to the public and any one has the privilege of paying his respects lo these officials and their families on these days This rulo is observable from the ME l i Jijj 1JiiWJiMJI JiljtH I Eltsa movroe Mrs Hat resdent down There is no obligation f jni one official to another on such days i iJ yet it an jpixirtunity for strangers in tee dry to see something of official life aid many crowd ilie3e houses at these reeortoiLs That it is a more formality without much heart or purpose there are many evidences We have recollections of a reception given by a member the Cabinet It was tiie first session tiiat Hilly Mason was in Congress He enterel the list and made tiie visit after much perturbation of soul as to his duty in the matter He said afterward to a party with whom he was talKtng over trie reminiscences ol me day I dont know just how I would have got out of it if I had not gone up there You sec they were expecting me and when I entered the hostess and all tno ladies faces were wreathed in smiles and they received me like a lost brother and before I got through hearing how glad they were to meet me I felt like a culprit that I had allowed a thought to enter my mind that this pleasure above all others was tho one for me to indulge in and had I not gone how could I ever have been able to excuse myself to those ladies I chatted with ono and another and then I was captured and led into the dining room and you would have thought that it was the return of the prodigal son I was just laden with everything but the ratted cair When the time came for my departure I almost hated to say good by I felt very sure if there was a member of Con gress in Washington mat nau been taken heart and soul into official society it was William E Mason member of Congress from Illinois I advanced toward my hostess to give the salutary good night I should have said Good morning you know it was long alter riarK nut i nad not ained i have got on to tho social partition of the day here I made no mistake I said I bid you good morning madam I have had a charming time and I feit it too but she said Good morning we hopoyou will lie sure and come to our next reception will you not Mr Chum chum I walked out and just said to myself If they do not know who I am I do and Ill let tho reporters know Billy Mason of Illinois is in the swimof Washington society F W Think of a liall in which such high lights as Daniel Webster John C Cal houn and Henry Clay appeared John Quincy Adams gave a famous ball when he lived on F street opposite tho Ebbitt House He was then Secretary of State The liall was given Jan 8 1824 in honor of Andrew Jackson and his victory at New Orleans It was the most brilliant social affair that had ever been given in Washington No snap shots were taken in those days but if artists were true to the line old pictures indicate that everbody did honor to the occasion by appearing in full dress cos tumesbuff waistcoats blue coats gilt buttons white neck ties high chokers silk stockings and pumps This was an auspicious night for Gen Jackson John C Calhoun was in line on the Presidential ticket but his name was soon after withdrawn and Andrew Jackson nut in Calhouns place John Qunicy Adams the late host was running m opposition to mm Tho year succeeding the election was ono of great strife and bitterness Unfortu nately neither candidate was elected It had to go to tho House for a final do cision Tho roll of the House was called by States Tho votes of each State were de posited In a box and placed on a table The tellers were Daniel Webster and John Randolph who proceeded to open the lKxes and count tho ballots Mr Wcl ster announced the election of Mr Adams No event in the social affairs of Wash ington has been so associated with tho his tory of its politics as the Adams ball It was a strange turn in the affairs of these men that brought them into this 8cial cauldron and undoubtedly the seething was augmented by the rhyme in which John Ogg celebrated tho event in the Washington Hepuhlimn Jan 8 1821 one verse of winch reads thus Wend you with tho world to night Itrown and fair and wise and witty Eyes that float in seas of light iJiughing eyes and dimples pretty Holies and

however but it is liable to be changed into the dire3t ill fortune at any moment For the foxes aro exceedingly sensitive and a word carelessly spoken nay even a thought sometimes will serve to send them off in a huff and then all sorts of misfortunes will follow When a man is seized with a fit in Japan they say He is afflicted with foxes or He has made an enemy of the foxes Only half of the good done hy foxes is genuine A story is told of a woman who kept a littlo shop whero rice was sold Every night a tall woman entered the shop bought some rice laid two coins down upon tho counter andleft without saying a word The woman would place the coins in a drawer and think no more of them One day tho woman entered the shop bought her rice but as she turned her back the shopkeeper saw a long

reality a most potent power capable of producing infinite good For the purpose of ascertaining the exact value of this power a committee composed of a physi cian a well known jurist a prominent minister and a leading railroad man was appointed to investigate Hypnotism Tiie committee carried oif a series of investigations in regard to the power of hypnotism to influence the actions and deeds of peoplo in the everyday walks of life Tho first step taken by tho members of the Committee was to master the science in every detail so that they might state from personal exiKrienco tlue good or evil this strange power might produce They wrote the New York Institute of Science of Rochester N Y the greatest school of Hypnotism and Occult Sciences in tho world and received full fnd complete instructions in regard to how hypnotism may be used to influence people in business how to use it in treating diseases etc etc In a few days they mastered these instructions and were full fledged hypnotists it was clearly demonstrated that hypnotism may bo employed so that tho person operated upon is entirely unconscious of the fact that he is lieing influenced and all things considered the committee regard it as tho most valuable discovery of modern times A knowledge of it is essential to onos success in life and well being in society Dr Lincoln says after a thorough investigation that he considers it the most marvellous therapeutic or curative agent of modem times Judge Schafer although a legal light turned his attention to healing the sick and in a few treatments he completely cured John E Myers of Flemington N J of a strango malady that had kept him bedfast for nints years and which tho doctors said must surely kill him Judge Schafcrs fame spread for miles around and hundreds of people applied to him for treatment Mr Stoufer performed the astonishing feat of hypnotizing Mr Cunningham of Pueblo Col at a distance of several blocks no also hynotized an aged gentleman and had him run through the streets shouting Red hot peanuts for sale Mr Stoufer says it is indispensable to ones business success Rev Paul Weller says that every minister and every mother should understand hypnotismfor the benefit they can be to thoso with whom they are brought in daily contact In speaking of this marvellous power President Eliot of Harvard College said to the graduates Young gentlemen thcro is a subtle power lying latent in each of you which fewof you have developed but which when developed might make a man irresistible It is called Personal Magnetism or Hypnotism I advise you to master it Tho New York Institute of Science has just issued 10000 copies of a book which fully explains all the secrets of this marvellous power and gives explicit directions for
