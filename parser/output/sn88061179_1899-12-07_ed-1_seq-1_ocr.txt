RESULTS Ol' PEACE CONPERENCE. Ill response to thc Invitation of Ills Mit esty the finpemr of ltussln. delegates from went/-sii countries were aasemhled nt Ihe llrguc on the lsth of May. ns members if a conference In the Interest of peace. I'he occasion seemed to be opportune for he serious consideration af a pinn for the iiuiiic adjustment of International differ* ?nces, n subject lu which the American pen de have been deeply Interested for many ?cars, and n definite project for a perma icnt International tribunal was included In he Instructions to the delegates of the 'tilted States. 'lin* final net of ihe confer* nee Includes conventions upon the amellor itlnn of thc Inws and customs of war nfl nnd. the adaptation to maritime warfare if the principles of the ("oneva ('omen lon of i8B4. .uni the "\tcnslnn of Judicial nethods to International enses. The eon en tion for the pacific settlement of Inter? national conflicts embodies the lending fea urea of tlie American plan, with such mod (?cations na WCrC rendered necessary by the ?reat diversity nf views ami Interests rep esented by tin* delegates. The four titles f ihe convention provide for the mslnte ance of general peace. Hp* exorcise of good fllces nnd mediation, the formation of com- J ilsvions of in.piiiy and Internatloaal arni* ' ration. Thc provision for arbitration con- J rmplatea the formation of a permanent riluiiiaii before which disputed cases may . brought for sett lenient by the mutual unsent of thc litigants in cadi separate ase. The advantages of such a permanent rlbnnal over impromptu commissions "f .-li? lt ra tion arc conceived to bc thc actual ex dence of I competenl court, prepared to j dmlnlster Justice, thc greater economy re? lining fruin a well devised system, and the eui m n In tod Judicial skill nnd experience hich such a tribunal would soon possess. Thus Interpreted, ihe convention for thc ncltlc settlement of International! conflicts lay be recorded ns realizing the earnest rolfe of a great number of American cit I ?ns. whose deep sense of Justice, expressed i numerous resolutions mid memorials, hns tired them to labor for this noble achieve lent. Thc general character of thc con? fution already signed by tlie delegates of ion* than twenty sovereign states further untiiends it to the favorable actina of thc pilate of Ihe fnlted States, whoso ra*1.. it lon lt still nwnits.
