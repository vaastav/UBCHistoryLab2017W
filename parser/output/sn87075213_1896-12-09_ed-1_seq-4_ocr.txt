Congratulations and Condolences Over Result of the Late Election. Tlie Preildout'fl Mres.if: Rend Tho Homo Iminlerntlon lllll In tho Senate Effort to Secure Kew Untes for ComlUera- tluu of Special Orders Left Ovor. Washington-, Dec 7. Roth housos of congress mot promptly nt uoon nnd appointed committees to wait upon tho president aud Inform him that con gress was ready to recoivo any com munication he might bo pleased to make. The senate thereupon took a recess till 3:30 o'clock. Tho house adjourned until 2 p. m., when tho president's message was re ceived and read. Tho messago was dclivcrod to the senate by Mr. Frudon, one of tho presi dent's secretaries, and tho secretary of tho senate, Mr. Cox, began its reading, but that duty was very soon turned over to tho reading clerks. Tho house presented a bright nnd cheerful appearance Monday morning when the galleries were thrown opon to visitors. Tho galleries were crowded to overflowing long before Speaker Reed called tho house to order. Tho members of tho house, liko the occupants of the galleries, commenced to put in an appearanco as early as 10 o'clock, athough tho hour of meeting was 12. Tho republicans from the west and middle west who secured a renomination and were not engulfed in tho wave of free silverism which swept over tho commonwealth, con gratulated themselves and each other upon their good fortune. Mr. Crisp's desk was draped in mourning. After the reading of the president's messago the message was laid on tho tabic and the senate at 3:35 adjourned until one o'clock Tuesday. When tho reading of tho message was finished in the house, the death of Ex-Speaker Crisp was announced by Mr. Turner (dcm.), of Georgia, Suit able resolutions were passed and the house adjourned until Tuesday noon. Washington, Dee. 7. It is not likely that anything will bo done in cither house of congress Monday, except to exchange congratulations or con dolence, as the case may be, over tho election and to listen to the president's message. When tho lastsession closed tho house immigration bill had, and now has, tho right of way in the senate. It is the unfinished business; this will be called up pro forma at the expirn titn of the morning hour, 2 o'clock. Although known as the house bill on the calendar as reported to the senato by Mr. Lodge, it is a materially differ ent measure, all of the houso pro visions having been stricken out ex cept the enacting clause and a new bill substituted. This bill will be called up on Tuesday by Senators Lodge and Chandler, who desire to push it to a vote as quickly as possible. An eilort will be made to secure new dates for the consideration of special orders that were not reached during last session. 'lhcse measures are: Senate bill to prevent the desecration of the American flag; house bill to amend the act to prevent the extermi nation of fur-bearing animals of Alas ka; house bill to reduce tho cases in which the penalty of death may bo in flicted and benate joint resolution pro posing an amendment to the constitu tion providing for the election of sen ators by popular vote. An important bill, over whle'i there has developed a bitter fight, is the De troit bridge bill, for a bridge across the Detroit river. It was postponed last session until the first Monday in December. In addition to tho appropriation bills there aro several measures that will contend with others for the right of way. Prominent among these are the bills to refund the Pacific railroad debt, to admit the territories of New Mexico nnd Arizona, and Mr. Davis' resolution relative to the asser tion and enforcement of the Monroe doctrine.

URUGUAY. A Hoolutloimry r.Iovt-ment Alarm tho liciveriinu'nt. Ni;w Youk, Dec. 7. A special cable dispatch to the Herald from Kuenos Ay res says: Tho Herald's correspondent in Mon tevideo, Uruguay, telegraphs that the government is now thoroughly alarmed nt tho momentum which tho revolutionary movement has obtained. It has been learned that tho departments in tho northwestern part of Uruguay Salto, Pnysondu and Artig.is, will toon I declare in favor of the rebellion, and I that the leaders delegated by the peo ple of thoso departments will rendez vous with their forces at Concordia, in Entro Riop, Argentina, just across tho river Uruguay. At this point thero arc many per sons, including not only Uuruguayans, but citizens of Argentina, who aro in sympathy with the revolt. No further encounters havo occurred in Uruguay, and it is believed that tho insurgents aro awaiting tho new in vasion from the Argentine frontier be fore again risking a battle. Tho Krazillan minister of foreign af fairs has telegraphed assurances that stiict neutrality will be observed by Krazil in her sister republic's present trouble. Kx.ConRrmnifcn Horr (seriously HI.
