Mr. Me CWnand, of illinois, and Mr. f*ickles, of New York, aki spoke on the question of excusing Fr Hawkins. The debate was interrupted in order t?> allot* the introduction of a bill for the relief of th? Treasury.

At a meeting of tbc Cabinet yesterday, Mr. Cobb, the Secretary of the Treasury, re-igned his jHMt. and the resignation was accepted by the Pre sident.

Tbe meeting was strictly private, so tbat its proceedings cannot now be publicly made known. At tbe municipal election in Boston yesterday Mr. J. M. Wigiitman. u?e democratic and Union candidate for Mayefc **s cbo?en over Moses Kim ball, republican. We have advices from tbe city of Mexico to the 2*th nit., and from Vera Crux to the 7tb iast.

Tbe news, which will be fonnd con densed elsewhere, is of no great interest or impor tance. A peaceful solution of tbc Spanish dJB Cnlty is expected. Ry tbe arrival of the steamship Solo we bare intelligence from Kingston, Jamaica, to the 1st Inst. Tbe legislature met on the 9th nit., when tbe new Assembly organised, with Dr. G. McLarty Morale* as Speaker, for the third time. On the following day the Ministry announced their re fignatlon, and about two weeks after a new Minis try was appointed. A bill fot taking a census of the inhabitants was before the Assembly, with every proapect of p*?dng. The trial of the chief fnate Paul for the murder of Captain burton, of the American >a/k Alvarado. In Kingston harbor. ?*mm?ired before the Chief Jnstire, a* t!ie Kinr* Ion District Court, on the 20th olt, end was con cluded on tbe 7% d. when tbe Jnry, * t*i,vg hearing rounsel for the defrnre, retuiced n verdict of not guilty. Consequently this atrocious murder remain* ! a deep mystery. The " revivals" continued in Mil blaat in Cornwall county. The yellow fever had { considerably moderated. The Kingston Journal of the 29th alt. says:? By the arrival of tho steamer i'lantagenet, we learn that the civil war in Cartha gena has broken out afresh and with renewed vi gor. At the time the steamer left tilting was go : ing on, and such was the anarchy reigning that ' the British subjects- -among them the Consul ? had to take refuge on board her Majesty's steamer Cadmus, which was lying in port at the time. The fighting was chiefly in ambush, and a great many | were killed and wounded. We have received correspondence from Great ?lt Lake City of the 16th ult. A spec.al session of the legislature had been called by the Gover nor, and for two days the "brethren" had been to gether aligning the new Judges to districta. As . no prov ision for the support of the District Courts h.ul at the i-ame time been voted, hi.* Kxcellency I ri iu.-e<i his assent to the proceedings of the Legis lature, and the aeaaion was dissolved. The pony cxprt ss which left Han Francisco on the afternoon of the 28th ult. arrived at Fort Konr ny yesterday morning. The general news is unim portant. The markets continued very dull. Information was received at the office of the Liitcd States District Attorney yesterday that Fredericks, the first mate of the slaver Cora, which was brought into this port a prize, as already reported in the Hmhald, had nude his escape through n porthole of the veaac 1 ail swam to Wallabout, where he landed "without raiment and without food," or the means of procuring either. He has thus for the pre* nt eluded the authorities: but some of Marshal Rynders' vigilant deputies are in pursuit of him, and unless the fugitive is gi eased after the fashion of the Irish pigs, it is not likely that he can slip through tfceir hands. War rants have been issued for the apprehension of the other two officers of the Cora, and they have been formally handed over to the custody of the Mar shal. The District Attorney has libelled the ves sel for forfeiture. The Board of Aldermen met yesterday, but trans acted no bu-'ness of general interest. A report of | the prnceedutgs may be. found in another column. The Board of Councilmen held their usual meet ing last evening. A communication was received from the Hoard of fcxeise Commissioners respect ing ce rtain defects in the Excise law. The paper whs referred. The Mayor vetoed a series of reso lutions giving the Third Avenue Railroad Compa" ny permission to lay a track in 130th street. A re port of the Committee on Finance, recommending ihe transfer of $.15,000 from the appropriation for l!u.?s pavement to the appropriation for cleaning -treetx, and also the transfer of 18,200 to pay the n.embers cf the Common Council, were adopted. In the Court of Oyer and Terminer yesterday the Dihtrict Attorney accepted a plea of murder ;ri the second degree in the case of Franz Hoffman, indicted for the murder of Mrs. Schumacker and her child, at Bloomingdale, some months since. The prosecuting officer was induced to accept this plea, partly because of some doubts respecting the exi. ting law relative to capital punishment, :uid partly because of some doubts as to the san ity of the accused. The trial of James Massey, the pugilist, charged with committing a felonious assault upon a police officer, was postponed till Uie 24 tli instant. The young man suspected of having murdered Mrs. Shancks, of No. 22 Kast Twelfth street, has been arrested at a station on the Erie Railroad, some three huudrcd miles from New York. He will probably arrive in this city to-day. The Coro ner's investigation concerning the murder was to liavebeen resumed yesterday, but the proceedings were postponed until to-day at two o'clock, in I order that the prisoner may be present at the ex amination. The trial of the suit of Mr. Burch, of Chicago ttgaim-1 Lin wife, for dhorce, wax concluded yes terday at Naporville, Illinois. The jury rendered a verdict for Mr*, iiurch, the defendant. According to the City Inspector'* report, then' were 338 deaths in thin city daring the past week, a decrease of 71 a* compared with the mortality of the week previous, and 73 lew* than occurred ilurin* the corresponding week last yesr.

The newM from Washington is of the moat striking chnraf nr. The Secretary of the Treasury has positively tendered his resignation to the President. and will immediately return t*? take p.trt in the action of the Georgia secessionists. In the House of Representatives, Mr. Haw kins, the single number from Florida, has peremptorily declined to act upon the extraor dinary committee raised by the House for the purpose of conference upon the critical condi tion of the country, and ha.- resigned his seat. Thin action on tbe part ol Messrs. Cobb and Hawkins is the most significant evidence of th* deep seated Southern feeling thatwe hare yet received in any official form. The black repub lican journals have been endeavoring to con ceal the truth from tbe people, and to per suade them that the secession movement Is confined chiefly to South Carolina. It cannot be suppo?ed that either Mr. Cobb or Mr. Hawkins could have acted without consulting the opinion of the people of (?eorgin and Florida. Thus we sec that the secession movement is not the mere outbreak of a few Are-eaters, but tbe result of the settled convictions of the solid men in the Southern States. It is the exterior developement of the swift, strong, re*i*tl?a* undercurrent of public opinion, which fl .w* steadily on to Its purpose. Unless some m^an* are speedily adopted to arrest this movement It will soon ira permeate the wlwie South. "Thus bad begins, but worse remains behind " Ccnrlliatlom and for rt- torn? More PmIc Sinoe the opening of thin second term of the present Congress it bas been a problem, diffi cult of solution, what course would be pur ged, what measures, if any, be adopted, and what tone of public feeling would be ini tiaU<i by the representatives of the people at Wa.-Li?gton in the present national crisis. The President's Message, looked forward to with so much anxiety, has complicated rather than settled the question of the course most expe dient to be adopted. That document wis in tended, fron j highest and most patriotic point of view, to soothe the public min i and to pour oil upon the troubled waters. It ex nosed. 1 practically, the folly, wickedness aud dan ger of extreme counneli and ultra measures, and appealed to each good citbien to aid in averting the perils and preventing the disaster with which passion, Kelt-interest and Northern and Southern demagoguism menace the country. Unfortunately it has not been received with anything like unanimity of op'mion by the frag ment.-' and cliques iuto which old parties, now rent asunder and united by no defined and biding policy, have become irreconcilably di vided It has not conciliated the extremist* of lie slave States, and the republican* of the North are loud in Uieir clamors of indignation at what they call the lukewarmness of its re commendations. The heated elementH remain where they were; and with every desire to cor rcspoid to the requirements of the emergency, it i* not probable that the outgoing adminis tration will be enabled to accomplish anything effectively for the weal and safety of the con federation. It is different with the power which has been l hosen by the people to maintain their dignity vnd represent their interest* during the four ! years to commence on the 4th of March, 1861. 1 Upon Mr. Lincoln and his advisers will de volve the responsibility of determining whether his heretofore prosperous republic shall con inue in it>- integrity, and what means they will | adopt to secure such a result. They cannot ^ shirk from direct and energetic action in the premises. A crisis has arrived, which, if mot wisely, might possibly, notwithstanding the dark clouds which obscure the political hori yen, prove eventually beneficial to the Union. If, on the other hand, unskilful pilotage and evil counsels prevail, no modern Cassandra can depict in gloomy enough colors the horrid future cf disaster which inevitably awaits us. And it is to be feared that those who ^re destined to wield the patronage and power of the incoming government have but an imper fect perception of the importance of their inis sion. The outcry of the black republican j journals of the country against the peaceful ! tone of Mr. Buchanan's Message began on the I very day of its appearance. Mr, Hale, of New Hampshire, from his place in the United Stan* Senate, denounced it in the most scurrilous, undignified and unmeasured terms of abuse, lie scouted the notion of peaceful Mtwion on the part of the Southern States, aiul appealed to the "incoming admin istration not to quail in the performance of a duty" which he compares with "the baptism of blood" Italy Is now undergoing to recover its nationality and independence. "Deep answers unto deep," and this incendiary harangue elicited a corresponding note of defiance lrom Mr. Ivervon, ot Georgia, who loudly pro claimed the "hatred" between North and South, welcoming the citizens of the farmer to -hospitable graves.*" Could anything be more deplorable.' Any scene more unworthy of the dignified con*ultatious of a I niled State* Senate? And, in the midst of it all, the Presi dent elect silent anil resened, refraining from the utterance of a word which should signify r< bttke of the sentiments of his followers, so hasty in their advocacy of coercion and blood shed, instead of conciliation and the exhaustion of every peaceful effort to save the Unionl As the country approaches the verge of the pre cipice over which its destinies are about to be plunged into remediless destruction, those who .d ne could save it hasten it on to ruin. It was to have been hoped that the panic m ?king tendency ot Senator Hale s speech * ould have caused the partisans of the domi nant party in the North to pause and considor h. tdie they continued their clamor for the owning of U ? temple of Janus, for a civil, partisan war, which would reduce us to a U.*er level than Mexico, prostrate commerce, destroy manufacture-, annihilate the value ot -ccuritle*, reduce the laboring classes of the country to pauperism, and render insecure the possesions of the rich. But so far is this from being the ca*e that the leading republican journal* of the country, those which are sup p?*.ed to represent correctly the views of Mr. I intoln aie loudest in their panic making out ( ry tor bloodshed and national ruin, ' the fire. r;.pe and slaughter," which are the inevitable attendants of civil discord, and declaim with the utmost vehemence and rancor against the friends of peace and measures of concilia lion. So late as yesterday a prominent black republican organ of this city exclaims as fol low*: ?

Brown a invasion is called for on thr Urgent hod moat extensive scale ? tbe "irrepressible conflict," in its most furiou* and diabolical proportion*. And if thw is the language used now, It will become Immeasurably worse after Mr. Lincoln aLall have been inaugurated. The republican party is evidvP'ly resolved vo ter rorize the country and annihilate confidence. They aim a death blow at the vital tources of commerce and trade, and seek to stagnate and paralyse international intercourse. American seenritien declined with tbe creation of the re publican party. The Kaota* troubles were made under it* auspice* an instrument to affect the stook market, to depreciate the value of merchandise and to diminish credit with each *f"p in adrnn ?? towards power; if ha? s?ujrht anew to ?bi tter the hvli of our national tad ?ta*e pro*pfri*v, pnd tbe [Mr;tlj~?ls which ha* already smitten affairs ia but the harbinger of u still more disastrous epoch, which its advent to power will inaugurate. If the statement* of iifc leaders are to be believed, there can be no sunrise in the future of the republic. "There shall be war;" "there must be civil war;" ''there will be no disunion that ia not ac companied or followed by war," are their pttnic making denunciations from day to day, and they proclaim those to be traitor* who ven ture to hope for peace or prosperity. If these are the sentiments which shall rule Mr. Lin coln's adminiatrution, its inauguration will bo line beginning of such national disasters as have been seldom witnessed in the history of tuitions. Abolitionism Ajjlv Dknchjm'kd fkom tuk 1'rnjTr. ? In the Oity of Churchos, over the East river, where ho many of the Wall street mer chants have their residence**, the pulpit had been turned into a political engine to overthrow the institutions of the Southern States, to dissolve he Union and to foment civil war. Among ;bo most noted of the abolition preacher* in Brooklyn is Henry Ward Beecbor. Hut it is creditable to the sister city that sue has fur abler preachers of the opposite stamp ? conser ! vative men, who believe that it is not the mis sion of ministers of the Gospel to employ their influence to subvert the civil government of the country and to inflame one portion of the peo ple against another. Among these preachers is Rev. Dr. Littlejohn, of the Episcopal Church of the Iloly Trinity, and Rev. Mr. Vandyke, of the First Presbyterian ( Lurch, who.se admirable k rroou on Sunday evening last we published yesterday at full length. With rare ability he maintained and illustrated the four following positions: ? I. Abolitionism has no foundation in the Scriptures. II. Its principles have been promulgated chiefly by misrepresentation and abuse. III. It leads, in multitudes of cajea, and by a logical process, to titter infidelity. IV. It is the chief cause of tho strife that agitates and the danger that threatens our country. In his introductory remarks Mr. Vandyke stows with great force and point that there are two classes of abolitionists those who de nounce slavery at a safe distauce, ami whose faith is without works; and those who, like John Brown, go into the very midst of the al lcged wickedness, in order to set the slaves free? and he goes on to observe: ? II if not for mo to decide who of ihM* ,.re tho truest to tbeir own principle*,. It i* not for me to decide whether tl.i mail who preache* thM doctrine In brave wordx nini<1 applaadinp multitude* in the city of Krouktyn ? r the ono who in the Milhiaw of the ni^h't, and in tho faw I t liK" law M terrors, Koe? to pr. , imc thu pri-aching at Hat per s terry, in tho most (oaawtout abolitionist and t.ie in. .?t heroic man It Ut not for me to decide which is the irif*t important part of a tree, and if the ti ee bo p >i i-onovis, which ts the mo?t injuriou.-, tho root or t ?i Crunches, or the fruit But I uin here to night in (iod'H imine, arid by His help, to show that this tree of aboli tionism w evil, and only evil, root and brauch. Unwo und leaf and fruit. It is fortunate that, whilst moral and political poison is disseminated from one pulpit, the anti dote comes from another. Mr. Vandyke shows from the Holy Scriptures, and even from the commentaries of learned unti-^lavery writers, that the founder of Christianity and his Apostles not only did not assail slavery as a sin, though they attacked all other Bin-t, but gave it their tacit and sometime their express sanction. One of these commentators, Dr. Way land, undertakes to excuse Crist and ' Apostles for not speaking out their opiniot against slavery "for fear of a servile war." That consideration, it seems, Las hut little in fluence on many of our Northern clergy. Their aim is rather to produce a servile war. But it is very absurd to say that thoser\po*tle? w ho denounced idolatry and every fwrm 'of sin by mime, and died a* martyrs In consequence of the boldness of their preaching, should, from prudential motives, spare slavery alone, if it w is. as modern ministers of the Gospel affirm, "the sum of all villanies." Their practice was to go among the sinners and tell Oicm their sins, not like some of our Brooklyn divines, who attack not the sinners who hear them, hut U'i..-e who . ?> a thousand mile away. The 1< gical deduction, therefore, is th..: Christ and hi- Apostles did not consider slavery sinful; for i' certain that the iiMti'.ulixn existed every where they came, and that St. Paul exhorted .-laves to obey and honor their musters, and, in .-teud of running them <>ff, sent fugitives back to the service to which they were bound. Setyaons like that of Mr. Vandyke are cal culated to do great good, and if the conserva tive clergy generally had only come out in time against the infidel abolition fanaticism, the c< untry perhaps would not be reduced to the deplorable political condition in which we find it to-day. Thk Irrki'rkmhidijc Conflict at Hour. ? It will be seen by the intelligence from Boston which we publish to-day that the abolition ex citement created by the attempt to hold a John Brown glorification meeting at Tremont Tem ple last week ha* not died out The abolition fanatic*, it appear*, hare determined to hold another meeting thia week ? Mr. Andrew, the Governor elect, having consented to preside at it? which the conservative and solid men of Boston are equally determined shall be put down, by force if nec<v?sary. The irrepressible conflict has thus fairly commenced at home ? not between the North and South, but In tho very centre of abolition fanaticism itself. TTie abolitionists have called upon the Mayor and the Chief of Police to protect them at the next meeting, and both these functionaries have replied that th^y will protect them "if possible" ? thus implying a doubt that the force at the command of the authorities will prove strong enough to prevent riot and blood Shed. The capital of New England, that sec tion which has been the souree of all the trouble which has arisen out of the anti-slave ry agitation, it would seem, is about to reap the first fruits of the addling and mischievous policy her agitators have been carryi g out for the last twenty -five years. All the misfor tune which has now befallen the country, and the still more terrible ejils which threaten us in the future, are due to New England, and if the secession of the Southern State* should en sue, the best thing the rest of the country (jyuld do would be to Cut off New England and let her stand alone, to pursue what course she I pleases. Her perpetual agitation of the slave ! ry question has brought on all the troubled which afflict us- which have reduced our great I :ind prosperous confederacy to the verge of iuin? and if we were once rid of her the re i ami lift portion of the oountry would go on l.amonicusly and prosperously enough. Mer.ntin.t me would suggest to Garrison' ! j< nry Ward Heecber, Wendell Phillips and ?he ctl^r sritator* of uiti% abolition penti ments, who have bo a worshipping the al mighty nigger for the but quarter of a century, that a trip to Europe just now would prove very bt . ficial to their health. It is pretty evident, from the turn affairs are taking in Bos ton, that their ease and comfort will be any thing bti' afe in this country in six months from this time. Thk La y Dajuno Mcrdkr in Twelfth iyriuirT. ? t . me clue has at length been obtained to the m ynu i y of the late horrible and daring murder of t!.e poor widow lady in Twelfth j street, in ti e arrest of the carpenter whose presence an nd the dwelling of the victim had for some i.ine previous to ihe tragedy cre ated some alarm in the mind of the deceased and suspicion on the part of her friends. He was captured on .in emigrant train on the Erie Kailroad, while ndeavoring to escape. Nothing in th? criminal record of this city heretofore has equalled in boldness this terri ble murder. Ti e Uurdell murder, desperate ne were all its features, was perpetrated under the shadow of night, and was surrounded by circumstance which invented it with all the seciesy and stealthinoss which usually charac terize premeditated homicide; but this crime v i)s committed in open day, in the very midst of a busy and stirring community, within a fc.K>rt distance of our great fashionable high vay, Fifth avenue, and in a house occupied by numerous tenants, all awake and*moving about in the ordinary avocations of the day. What can we argue from these facts but that there is absolutely no protection for human life in this metropolis; that we have no police equal to the duty of preserving our citizens from the hand of the assassin; that, whether by day or by night, n* one is safe alone, even in his or her own domicile ? It is evident that if people can be brutally murdered at their breakfast tables, in broad daylight, in the midst of a populous neighborhood, and the assassin can walk into our dwelling openly? do his w nrk of murder, rifle the property at his lei sure, and depart unseen and unheard, save by his unhappy victim? no man's life is safe tor an hour, and that it is imminently danger ous for any one to venture out at night alono and unarmed. Was there no patrolman in Twelfth | street on Friday morning when this mur derer entered the store of the deceased, took her life, and coolly ransackod the pre- j mises, helping himself to whatever wa* valu able therein? If there was, how does it happen that the presence of a character of so suspiciouo nn appearance as this man described to be could have escaped his notice? And if there was not, how are the police authorities going to answer for the negligence? It is remarkable that in this case, a* in so many other instances of grave crimes, of vio lence and bloodt-h. d. the perpetrator is a mere youth? one of that class the most dangerous uiid desperate which infest the city, whose early careers of crime are unchecked by n pro per administration of justice in our criminal courts. And to this deficiency in our courts of law is attributable much of the existing crime in the city. The Administration of criminal law has been so notoriously lax that it has e mboldened the marauder. It has become ho 1 easy to escape the consequences of crime that the law has no longer any terrors for the evil doer. And lest the infliction of punishment was not difficult enough before, the last Legis lature passed an act rendering the penalty of murder in the first degree impossible to be im poM'd. That honest and pious body of legis lators. while they were plundering thin city of its rights and franchises through the medium -f gridiron railroads and other nefarious mea sures, as a kind of salve to their consciences, enacted a law to prevent the effusion of human blood upon the scaffold. We have ?4>en the effects of that enactment in the vast increase of bold and desperate murders in this city for the past year, of which this last one i* a terrible example. It is to be hoped that the Legislature which assembles in January will see the necessity of repealing the law of last session, which practically alndishes capital punish ment. We ln.ve had victims < nough to its mis chievous tendency: and, whatever may be -aid In favor of the abolition of the death pe nalty, it is manifest that the times are not ripe f< r it in the city of New York. CnuorR Ri.v?;i.ationh Comqbrktm thk Fo hi ion Sum Tiuwt.? Some six month? ago the I lack republican journals he rv about* attacked i.f very savagely because wo insinuated that oin<" of Mr. Seward's supporter* were inte r. *t?d, directly or indirectly, in the foreign stave trade. At that time a number of vessels wi n detained at thii* port on suspicion that they had been Gtted out for "pleasure excur sions" to the coast of Africa. Prominent in this spotted fleet wan the bark Cora, which, to a practiced eye, bore the most unmistakeable marks of her trade. The Cora had that rakish, fast, rascallj air which distinguishes piratical craft, and denote* their calling as clearly at) the drofs and mannrr of a gambler or a wo man of the town draw the llae between them and decent people. Dut as this in moral, not legal evidence, the Cora went her wicked ways, took on board over seven l^indred slave*, and wa* captured after a stern chase, of course a long one, by the ocean police. It turn* out now that the r?ru was purchased, at a very high price, from K. D. Morp. n, the Governor of this Stab', chair man of the Republic. in "National" Committee, and one of tie endorsers of the Helper book. We do not undertake to *.;y that the Governor knew that the Cora was purchased for the traf fic which his party denounces as the "sum of all villanies," and to engage in which is one of the highttt offenfes known to the law; but it .-<>ems just a little odd that the foreign slare trade, which has been very act Ire during the fast year or two. is carried on exclusively by Northern men or foreigners; that Maine fur niches the vessels and New York the enrgo and the facilities for shipping out to sea And then, too, it is still more singular that the names of leading black republi can* should be frequently mixed up with such matters. Some people have been ill natured enough to say that the black republi cans were playing a double gam#? making po litical capital by oharging the South with re opening the foreign slave trade, and turning a penny at the same time. Of course this is sheer calumny; but still It strikes people generally that where there to so much smoke there must 1 a a little Arc; and we call upon the United Staff* efflcer* to do their whole duty in all < wvr like that <? Ihe t'?ra. The public ba? n | right to full infortuafioa upen all such i&aUvfs, Prbhm<!kj? or tub Turns. ?There never wu e period at ujr previous time in our ctinmwcial histoiy when matters wore m gloomy and discouraging an aspeot m it present. The beet stodks in the market hare tumbled down to a point of depression which they hare never before reached; on cotton there has been a fall of three cents a pound, with a prospect of a still further decline; on breads tuffis there has been a corresponding de preciation, good shipping Hour being now a dollar and a half lower than it was at the end of October; the falling off in the valae of real estate may be averaged at from twenty-five to forty per cent, with a total impossibility of effecting sales. No one will venture upon in vestments of this kind with the uncertainties which are staring him in the face. So great, in fact, is the prevalent distrust in the future, that it is questionable whether, if any of our finest mansions in Fifth avenue were put up at auotion, they would bring half the mo ney they have cost. What a revolution in the course of a few weeks! Then we were selling our cotton and breadstuff's at high prices. and w<*re supplying food to Europe so freely that the British cotton market was not affected by the short harvest For the first time in our commercial history we could boast of being the creditors instead of the debtors of Europe. All this has beea suddenly changed, as if by the wave of a magician's wand. Everything at present wears an aspect of the greatest gloom and depression, unrelieved by a single gleam of hope. Bad as the condition of affairs is, the impression seems to weigh upon every one's mind that it will be still worse. And, what is more discouraging, no limit can be fixed to its duration. It is unexampled in the history of commer cial crises that such a sudden and widespread tag revulsion, extending even to Enrope in its effects, should be brought about by the eleva tion to power of an obscure politician. It is not because of his antecedents, nor of his ca pacity for evil individually, but because of his personal and party affiliations that so much ap prehension has seized upon men's minds. His election is regarded as a substantial evidence of the triumph of a faction which holds its al legiance to the constitution as lees obligatory than its fidelity to an abstract principle which it is bent upon carrying out, to the destruction of all the beet interests of the country. It is no wonder, then, that the mercantile community should feel impressed with the idea that a great and permanent calamity has befallen it, and that property and values of every kind should sympathize with the conviction. A few deceive themselves with the belief that the depression is merely transitory, and that a few months will see the end of it Under the most favor able view of things, it will be at least two or three years before the trade of the country re covers from the shock inflicted upon it by Lin coln's election. Thk Chf.vai.ikk Wkbb on Skckssiox. ? Our military and diplomatic cotemporary is a good deal exercised latterly about the course of the IIkraj.d. lie declares that this journal is n pro-slavery, secession paper, and that the "un fortunate d? lirium of the South" is owing te the fact that the Nkw Yokk IIkrald has been its principal guide and counsellor. As usual, Webb turned things upside down, and made a tatement which is directly contrary to the acts of the case. The Hkrauj is a conservative Union organ, printed for the whole country generally, and the city of New York particularly. We have always been in favor of treating slavery as a Southern social institution, with which the North hits nothing whatever to do. And had our coun m Is been heeded the country would now have been as prosperous and happy as ever. We advised the Southern democracy to unite with the North in the nomi nation of a good man at Charleston. Had that course been adopted Lincoln could n? ver have been elected, and there would have be< n no panic. We pursued a similar line of policy with the old whig party; bat iU leader* sacrifieed their followers to gratify personal ends, and so broke down. Then we tried to bummer an idea or two into the heads of the Know Nothings; but between the slavery ques tion and the wild hunt for the spoils, the dark luntern men beciunc thoroughly disorganized, aiid went the way of all flesh. And now we arn endeavoring to point out the proper path to the black republit uns, who have the future of the country in their hand? ; but we have very little hope that they will walk therein. If they wi.-Jti to avert the perils which now menace the nl.ip of State they must throw overboard all their U: el ess platform lumber, their Personal Liberty U :ish, and the dead weight of abstractions as is slavery in the Territories. As for the Chevalier Webb, had he taken ! our advice offered twenty years ago, be I would hsve been tc<d%y a wealthy man, | itisteud of being obliged to shin around Wall street when be has a not' to pa) 1 Tlie fact is that we represent the voice of the people, and Webb that of the politicians; and unless the latter chungc their tune right speed!* h, we shou'il not be surprised to see a terrible outbreak of popular indignation av.i;\M the n''olitioo leaders and fanatical parsous ol the Iv ? .-them cities. In such care they might find it hard work to escape being hanged upon tlm r. ost conveni?n? lamp pest Only our good fi iend Tuurlow Weed, who has been led to see tl.e frrov of his ways, and U now doing pen auce for his sins, would escape.
