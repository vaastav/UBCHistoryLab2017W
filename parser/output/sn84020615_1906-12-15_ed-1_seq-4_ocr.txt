ALBUQUERQUP- EVENTS Q CITIZEN, PAGE FOUR. SATURDAY, DECEMBER 15. 1906. THE ALBUQUERQUE CITIZFN Publlehed Dlly tnd Vkly. By The Citizen Publishing Company V. . TRICKLER, President. W. T. McCREIGHT, Business Manager. AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY It is astonishing how the automobile Industry has niwn in this country. It has loen but a few years since the automobile was first heard of, and now it is said that the orders received by American automobile makers for 1H07 nunilaer 45.000, this representing un In-rrc-ase of 10, nut) over the output for the year now closing. The factories are unable to meet the demands made upon them, in some cases every machine being sold which ran possibly be constructed during the coming year. At the exhibit of automobile and automobile fixtures In New York 224 different machines were displayed, rcprescent ing a total Nile price or $1.11110,11011. Those figures only partially indicate the tremendous hold which this method of transportation is gaining in this country. The foreign makes of machines must be added to the domestic ones a Tully sliow thai. Clearly, the automobile is here to stay, and is to be calculated upon as a potential factor in the Industrial and social life of the present and the future. Great steps in social evolution have resulted from smaller causes. What began as an expensive toy of the rich is rapidly becoming a popular necessity. Constant attention to the development of low-priced motors is steadily increasing the field of usefulness. The automobile Is bound, like the trolley car. to immeasurably extend the residence dis-trieV of cities. Already a writer in a leading maga zine thinks he foisees one mighty city, .loo miles long and averaging U least five miles in width, extending Troni IVrtland, Me., to Washington, as a result of fast trains, trolleys and automobiles. This seems a dream, but even dreams have been outdone by fact. One Interesting and very important result of the common use of the automobile is the popular Interest it fxcrles in mechanism. Every automobile show is an ef fective school In mechanics, and thousands eagerly be come absorbed pupils. The "scoot cart" driven by a fool, 4o the menace of people's lives, is one thing. Hut the aatoniubile as a factor in industry, pleasure, business and social evolution, is quite a different thing. The one shows the silliness of some individuals. The other dem onstrates the general progress of the mass. fortunately for the Oorman empire although unfortunate ly for the cause of lilorty, one citizen Is not as good as another when it comes to voting In Germany and the men who vote the socialist ticket do not hapen to be the property-owning class or the nobility. Quite frequently one can see some of the irrigation plans proposed by the government of this country spoken of as the greatest irrigation enterprise in the world. 1 1 Is well known, says the New Mexican, that the British government has erected on the Nile the most costly Irrigation works in the world. This river fur nishes water for the irrigation of 5,000,000 acres, an area -which though less than that of Chaves or of Socorro county, yet it. is divided among landowners exceeding in number I.imio.ooo. Of these, ti.OiMj are Europeans; the others natives. There are 940,000 farms, less than five acres in area, supporting their owners. Only 12,noo fanners have holdings that exceed fifty acres in area, while 21 per cent of the lands are owned by proprietors having each between five and twenty acres. Intensive cultivation is bringing alout marvelous results and New Mexico may well look to Egypt as a nation that knows how to husband its land and Its water and Is milking both do many times the service they do In the arid regions of the United StateB. What the Nile is to Egypt, that the Rio Grande should be to New Mexico. No doubt such will become the case in due time. If the valley above as well as below this town wero settled thickly, the farms being small as in Egypt, Albuquerque would be a very different city from what it Is today. The MpuliHt party in Kansas is going out of busi ness. The party east less than 1,200 votts In the 'state at the last election, and the state chairman says the or ganisation is disbanded. At one time Kansas was a cha ttel of populism, which grew until it captured the entire oommon wealth. That era produced "SockleBs" Simpson, eccentric and brainy; and Peffer, with his whiskers and real ability; and Mrs. Elizabeth I-ase the btinglest fe male platform orator America has produced. The popu list was a prophet with a message which his generation rejected. Today the chief things the populists urged are to be found in the platforms of lioth the big political parties. Ten years ago the populist was ridiculed for Ills advocacy of governmental authority. The stone that waa then rejected of the builders has become the head of the corner. That vision of the populist, thought to be hut a barren ideality the vision of federal power and in tervention is now not only an accepted truism, but it Is sought to extend It to its farthest limit. Surely Simpson and Peffer ami Incase and Weller have been vindicated. The degeneracy of the American people, no doubt en oouraged and cultivated through yellow Journalism, is Hadly illustrated by a telegram from Syracuse, N. Y., which tells that thousands of people crowded Un; depot there to catch a glimpse of Chester Gillette, convicted of the murder of Grace Brown. A conservative estimate of the size of the crowd which struggled and scrambled to see the condemned man can be placed at lu.ooo per sons. And only a handful got the desired glimpse These fortunate ones clambered on the car platform, and peering through the window in the car door, saw the criminal. Sheriff Klock had wired ahead f;r social po lice arrangements, hut it. would have laken a squad of New York reserves 200 strong to have roped with the situation. Gillette would have been nulled to nieces if hU keepers had been obliged to take him from the Buffalo train to the one for Auburn In the regular way. The special theatrical car was a godsend to the officers. Comment is uun"cesHury. Consul Malleu, representative of the Mexican gov ernment at El Paso, was notified the other day by his government that he treaty had been ratified with the United States, ly which Mexico will accept a certain proporion of water from the proposed Elephant Unite reservoir in lieu of $20,imhi,ihih damages asked (,f this country for deprivation of claimed water rights. It is doubtful if Mexico had any just claim in the premises, but the American government acted with its iisiihI lili erality. Hut now that this contention has been ninmel out of the way. the i'nited States should demand ol Mexico reputation for the lininen.se damage inflicted upon this country by the turning of the Colorado river iato the Sulton sink. This was done through iinunipeieuee of those whom the Mexican gowrntucnt allowed t,, i, the river on Mexican t rritorv. Accord.

OCCXCCXXC30XX $ ABOUT GREAT TREASURES 8 g SUNK IN GREAT LAKES $ XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXKXXXXXX Those who live along their shores, but voyage on their watets only In the way of summer holiday excur sions, are wor.t to regard the American lakes as rather commonplace affairs, with little of the romance or mys tery of the salt seas about them. We sehlom think of "vanished" ships, lost with none to tell the tale of tnelr fate, In connection with the lakes, or of treasure ships whose wreck ar- sought for years and tire well worth the search. Huron is sometimes called "The I-nke of Sunken Treas ure," as there are believed to be more wrecks with valu able cargoes In the neighborhood of Saginaw bay than anywhere else. In the days when the Huron shore was filled with lumber camps large sums of money were ship ped in small vessels, and many of these were lost. And In these waters lia-s the great prize of the lake treasure seeker. In ISC the steamer Pewabic, with nearly $500,000 in copper from the Lake Superior mines, simply vanish ed In Lake Huron. For over thirty years expedition after expedition sought the wreck in vain. Finally, In 1897, a party from Milwaukee sttcceded In locating the hulk of the Pewabic about six miles southeast of Thunder bay. Owing to the depth of water only $7,000 worth of cop lKr has as yet been recovered. Nor is lake treasure seking without Its perils. In raising, in r.toi, tne steamer William Home, sunk in lS'i.'a with $20,000 worth of steel billets off Swlshwah point. Lake Michigan, one diver was killed and another paralyzed. And many men ha,ve been overtaken by sud den storms ami drowned while treasure hunting in the lakes. In the twenty years bet wen 1878 and 1808, there were n.S'.lil wrecks on the lanes, or wnicn l.uys were total losses. The total cargo loss on the lakes is esti mated at n it less than $12,000,000, much of It In indis tructible form of property. These tales of sunken treasure go clear back to lf80, when the Griffon, La Salle's ship, disappeared in Lake Huron with $12,000 In gold coin. Altogether there Is In the history of the American i lakes no more lack of the materials of romance than there Is lack of human daring and suffering in the daily lives of those who contend with their stormy waters.

Is the president's message on admitting the Japs to the public schools of San Francisco anal the threat to use all the power he has as president to enforce the rights of aliens under treaties, merely a lubrication ot the ways preparatory to launching the Wilson aloct.-ine? Has President Roosevelt put himself at the head ot a movement to bridge over the blanks between the limits of possible state jurisdiction and the limits of actual national jurisdiction over the contrail of the great business corporations, and to so broailly interpret the powers of the national government that congress may go beyond constitutional limitations and exercise general rights and powers not derived from the particular stata-s, but resulting from the union of the whole? Who was James Wilson and what is the WHson doctrine? These are queset ions which statesmen, politicians and constitutional lawyers will be asking on the heads of the president's ma'ssage, when they coma' to put two and two tagether. An interesting light is thrown on the president'. meaning when what he says in his nia-ssagaf concerning governmental regulation of corporations anal the Jap anese controversy Is consida'retl in connection with bis speech at the dedication of Pennsylvania's new capitol and a recent explanation of the so-called Wilson doctrine as circulateal by Andrew Carnegie. In the president's speech at tne dedication of I'enn slyvania's new capitol ha said: "I cannot da better than base my thetjry of governmental union upon the wairals ami ilea-ais of one of Pennsylvania's gra-ata'st sons, Justice James Wilson. e believed in the peo ple with the faith aif Abraham Lincoln, and. coupled with his faith in the people, he had what most of the men who in his generation believed in the people dial not have that is, the courage to recognize the faa-t mat faith In the people amounted to nothing unless the representa tives of the people assembled together In t he national government were given full and complete power ta work on behalf of the people. He developed even before Mar shall the doctrine (absolutely essential not merely to the efflia'ney but to the existence of this nation) that an inherent power restasl in the nation, outside of the enu merated powers conferred upon it by the constitution, in all cases where the object Involved was beyond the power of the several states and was a power ordinarily exercised by saivereign nations." JTesiitent Koohevclt then went am in the same speech ta make the application ta existing governmental difficult ia-s. "Certain judicial decisions have alone just what Wilson feared." he saial. "They have as a matter of fact. left. vacancies, left blanks between the limits of possible state jurisdiction and ilia- limits of actual natbmal jurisdiction over the control of the great busi ness corporations. It Is tha- narrow construction of the powers aif the national government which In our de mocracy has prova-d the chief means aif limiting the nat ional Kiwer to cut autt abuses, and which Is now that chief bulwark of 1l1ai.se great moiieyeal interests which oppaisa- and dread any atti-mpt to placa- tlit tn un.b r t f!i cient go a rumeutal control." This exploitation of the Wilson aloctrii:,. by I hi presl ab tit himself may throw llgln a;n what h,. means when hi' s.ns in thill part aif his mi-snagc relating to the super vision a.f corporations: "111 some method, whether by ll.ltinllal license law or in on lia r fashion, we must a t rcise, and that at an eariy ilan ;, far mmm,. complete cmlrol than at pra s ettt ovat thesa. gnat corporal 'oiis a control that will, among oilier ihings, pri vent 1 hi' evils of exra-ssiw aiva'i- capualizai ton, and that will compel ihi' iliseltasuie of each big c rpaiiation of its stockhoblers and of Its praip arias and luisiiu ss. whether owni'd din-atly or through subsidiary air atlilialeil companies " It may throw light also on this i a-t'-i t-iu-- to the Japanese situation in tha- message: "One ad' t It great a iuli.it rassiiunl s ai landing tha- performance of our in larnatinnal obligates is the tact that ilia- statutes of tha Cui'i'd States are t n:ivl inaala apiaa- Tha y fail to give tlia- national go a rn uia nt sufficiently ainpb' power, through I'niti d Stata-s c .nils and lay the usa- of tha- .ymy ami navy, to protcat aliens in their rights M-cured to th. in uinlir so!.
