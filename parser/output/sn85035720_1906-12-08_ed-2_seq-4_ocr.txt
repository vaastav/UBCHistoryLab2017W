SATURDAY, DECEMBER 8. HOW SENATOR ORVDEX STANDS. It ?will be remembered that before the election last month Senator Dry den announced that he was a friend of Roosevelt ami ho wanted to be re elected to the United States senate In order to help the president carry , out his policies. President Roosevelt has announced his policies in his recent message. It would be well for Senator Dryden to tell the people of New Jersey how he stands, now that there Is really some thing to stand for. Perhaps our good friend, James Martin, who came over from the New York Tribune to manage the Newark Advertise, will address Senator Dry den in a letter, on the questions in volved. It will be remembered that when Mr. Martin first took up his duties with the Advertiser he wrote to the insurance president asking him If he stood by Roosevelt. Senator Dryden replied most em phatically that he did and recited In stances to prove It. Thereupon Mr Martin announced thnt he stood for j Senator Dryden and the Newark Ad- j vertiser has been the best backer i Dryden has had. Senator Drydon might bo naked If i he would voto In favor of an Income | and inheritance tax which the preai- j dent recommends; whether or not he favors federal incorporation laws; amendments of the rate law; federal control of marriages and dlvorco; fedoral power to enforce treaties In spite of powers now reserved for the states; and many other policies rec ommended In the president's mos sag) and all of which will be passe 1 upon by congress during tho next e'x years. Senator Drydon says he stands by Roosevelt and wants to help hint. Will tho senator tell tho people whe ther or not he favors these things? Cut tho people will have a chance to know whether or not Senator Dry den really intends to help Roosevelt. A bill passed the house last year limiting the hours of railroad em ployment. When It reached the sen ate, Senator La Follette endeavored to have it made a part of the railroad rata bill, but the railroad senators fought It and by dodging, first one way and then the other, they succeed ed in having the bill laid over until j the present session. President Roosevelt. In his mee mjw, favored an eight-hour tinv fo ull railroad men and this menus thai he insists thai this hilt shall bo pas vl Sr ( f ' ?' ? " 1*7. ? ?

It is on the calendar lo: the senate to consider it January 51 and Senator La Follette can be de pended upon to have it brought uj. If Senator Dryden means what ho says wneu he asks to be ro-e'ecu-i to help Roosevelt, he will vote in favor of this bill which is fathered by La Follette. The people would like o have Dryden's direct answer to the important questions advanced la ti president's message, but if he refuse? to reply, his vote on the bill for sho er hours for railroad employes w: give some Indication as to how h 1 stands. The people of New Jerse: await the outcome with interest. I
