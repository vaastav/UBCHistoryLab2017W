bought from American citizens for 40 OO JOOproperty that I cost those citizens only 12000000 There is no doubt that the government paid 40000000 for the property But who got the money President Roosevelts reply to this most proper question Is for the most part a string of abusive and defama tory epithets But he also makes the following statements as truthful in formation to the American people The United States did not pay a cent of the 40000000 to any Ameri I can citizen The government paid 1 the 40000000 direct to the French government getting the receipt of the liquidator appointed by the French government to receive the same 4 The United States government has not the slightest knowledge as to the particular individuals among Avhom the French government distrib uted the same So far as I know there was no syndicate r there certainly was no syii dicale in the United Stales that to my knowledge had any dealings with the government directly or indirectly Statements Untrue To the best of the Worlds kuowl edge and belief each and all of these statements made by Mr Roosevelt and quoted above are untrue and Mr Roossvelt must have known they were untrue when he made them uAs to the detailed distribution or the Panama loot only one man knows it alL AnJ that man is William Nel son Cromwell The two men who were jncat in Mr Cromwells confi dence are Theodore Roosevelt presi dent of the United States and Elihu Root former secretary of war and now scretary of state It was hey who aided Mr Cromwell In consummating the Panama revolution arranged the terms of the purchase of the Panama canal made the agreement to pay 40 000000 on the canal properties and an additional 10000000 for a monufac tured Panama republic every penny of both of which sums was paid

If congress can have all the documents in the case as Mr Roose velt says let congress make a com plete investigation of the Panama ca nal affair and in particular of William Nelson Cromwells
