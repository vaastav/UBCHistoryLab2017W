DETAILS OF THE TREATY A correspondent of the Associated Press approached Senor Garnica of the Spanish commission for further details of the treaty He said 5 The fact that you represent all the American and English papers is really a reason why I should say nothing But what you show me as having been ca bled is substantially correct The ex act number of articles is still undeter mined It depends upon how Secreta ries Ojedo and Moore divide the treaty It may be twelve or twenty articles The Americans are to pay the indem nity within three months of the ratifi catron We shall appoint consuls in Cuba Puerto Rico and the Philippine islands without delay The Cuban consul will be accredited to the powers that be Asked why the Spaniards refused to grint tfe United State a coaling sta tion ill the Carolinas Senor Garnica saidThe The Americans could hardly expect that WE > shouldagree to discuss matters outside of the protocol after the lea lrLs we have had from them on this oint When we wished to discuss the Cuban debt they alJsolutel refused to consider it and then they ask us for whatever they want Que el toupe what cheek Yet the Cuban debt remains an important ques tion far settlement In regard to the Spaniards final pro test on the subject of the Maine Senor S Gal11ica remarked That protest now becomes history as it is embodied in thE protocol We do not wish to roe maIn under an imputation which would perpetuate nimosity and hatred against lIS and which would be a source of constant irritation in Spain It is neither loyal nor just that this thing should hang over the reputation of Spain We cannot submit to it It must be cleared up in justice to our selves There are many other causes to bring hatred between the two na tions without the addition of such a one as this 0 As to the future relations of the two countries that is one of the things histoty alone can determine Many nations which have been deadly ene mies are speedily reconciled Senor Garnica was questioned as to the future of the Philippine islands and II he said The United States hM inaugur ted I a policy which wlll bring it JDuch trouble and many responsibilities The Americans are not prepared for the work tiey are about to undertake Your democratic system must inaugu rate an imperialistic and bureaucratic system and you must increase your army and navy with the result that there will be constant friction between yourselves and the European powers I The AmerIcans preserve secrecy re garding the terms of the treaty This is partly through the influence of the three senators on the body who rep resent that it would be discourtesy to the senate to publish the terms before the treaty is presented to that body by the president TheprotocoI of the treaty will almost reach the dimensions of a volume as it will contain every written statement presented on both sides during the con ferences In spite of the secrecy observed by the Americans it is learned that the treaty in substance consists of thir teen or fourteen articles TIH principal articles provide for the cession and evacuation of Cuba Puerto Rico and the Philippine islands and the political administrative and financial results thereof the acquirement by the Unit ed States of public property aud the I relinquishment of archives The ant des of s econdary Importance determine the status of Spanish subjects residing in the ceded territories and unfinished law suits and contracts guarantees of the same terms to Spanish shipping and merchandise as imposed upon American shipping and merchandise in thc Phil ippine islands for ten years and leav Ing the status of Spanish commerce in the West Indies to be settled later An important provision is the guar antee religious freedom in the ceded territo in the same terms as the Florida treaty the Americans having steadfastly refused to incorporate an guarantee of the United States deter mination to favor the property of the Catholic church leaving it subject to the general laws as private property Senator Gray though well known to be radically opposed to the policy of annexation or imperialism will vote in the senate to ratify the treatycon idering that his signing that docu ment binds him to support it Proposed Tariff Reductions Washington Dec 9The = discussion of the details of the administration of government affairs in Cuba Puerto Rico and the Philippines under the treaty of peace which is about to be signed In Paris occupied a large part of the time at todays cabinet meeting The cabinet also talked over an elab orate tariff measure which is now in preparation here to go into force as now planned contemporaneously with I the entire relinquishment of the island I by the Spanish on Jan 1 This tariff measure it is said will show an aver age reduction all along the line of 50 per cent from the Spanish tariff rates The understanding now is that there will be no export duties and that in other ways the burden of taxation will be reduc 

MILITARY COLLEGES I Furnished Many Officers For the War With Spain Washington Dec 9The mual re port of the inspector general of the army made public tonight is some what unique the exigencies of the

the report is that on military olleges Fif teen thOusand students are being annu ally trained in practical and theoret ical military service in private and pUblic schools and colleges The presi dent

noncommissioned officers or pri v tes Accepting these statistics as a I fair average it would appear says the I I report that the regular and volunteer armies secured from the students an I nually instructed by regular army om cers at the various colleges enough offi I cers for twentyfour regiments In conclusion on this subject the inspec tor general says that some substantiJ recognition should be accorded the stu dents who spend a large part of their school life in military study and he recommends the selection of some of I the best of these students for appoint I ment annually In the army

week WM the entire absence of the customary nervous fright before I or after the meeting of congress the i presidents message and the tre3mrers report No one showed the least alarm and nobody could find occasion for any Money and stock and grain makes moved on exactly as if the government were automatic certain to Jo or say no more than the people had alinady decided and expected There is a larger demand for products in nearly all the great ndustries larger expo t de mand for foreign needs a more healthy domestic demand since seasonable weather arrived anda comfnciig con viction that November bUSlllSS the biggest ever done in this couniy in any month was but a step tow ard something better Exports last year in December were marvelops but this year are starting far ahead The Atlantic wheat fX ports flour included have leen for the week 5636767 bushels against 4312137 last year and Pacific exports 556523 bushels against 793083 last year and prices have declined 2c for cash but western receipts of 10135109 bushels against 63134 from last years great I crop stops argument The wheat does not come out at low prices or the peo ple have less to sell than last year at 20 cents more per bushel Woolen goods have been in much bet ter demand and many of the smaller mills have been buying after conces sions secured by the larger The much broader market is more healthy and promises far more for the industry and I sales of 10655200 pounds in two weeks pat at the three chief markets against 10852700 pounds in the same weeks of 1892 are quite in line with the demand in prosperous years Prices yielded I about half a cent in November accord ing to 100 quotations by Coates Bros5 and from Philadelphia dispatches I appear to be about a cent lower this week The rupture of the inchoate rail combination it appears resulted in lower prices and larger sales in the first week of sharp competition than were realized a week ago Prices were made in some transactions much lower than were then or are nm quoted and while 17 at Pittsburg is now named special orders are said to command lower figures The purchase of 150000 tons Bessemer pig at 10 at valley furnaces and 100000 tons billets for Pittsburg works at 1550 of which 40 000 tons went to a hoop mill with 11 000 tons rods at Chicago at 22 and 22 000 tons plates for one concern at Pitts burg besides enormous orders for bars and plates in car and shipbuilding steam contract on the Delaware and a contract for 5000 tons for bridges at Chicago give some idea of the heavy business coming forvard ji1ist when the works usually expect a period of idle ness and waiting Pig iron has risen at the east to 1150 and quotations for pig throughout the country a shade higher than at any time this year though prices for finished products have recently been declining and are lower than in the early months of the year I This weeks failures have been 248 in the United States against 312 last year I i and 22 in Canada
