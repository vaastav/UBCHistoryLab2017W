Many men burned in the mines by the explosion of gas owe their deaths to the fact that they have persisted in working without any shirts or otner protection lor their bodies save pantaloons. Often it happens that an explosion of gas occurs which would rove comparatively slight in its effects but or the great surface over which the burns extend. The treatment closes all the pores of the skin over the burned parts, and where these are extensive, the patient experiences a sort of asphyxia seems to be smothered to death. Even burns of slight depth, if embracing a large surface of the body, almost invariably prove fatal. It is against the rule in many jniues for the operatives to work without shift-, and it would be well to enforce the rule in all the mines and reduce the number of fatal at least 10 per cent. There is great temptation to throw off the clothing in some mines, especially those which are very deeD, as the temperature rises 1 degree for every fifty feet in depth, and in many mines the air that is forced Into the chambers becomes heated by the steam pipes in the down cast, and loses much of its vitalizing quality before it reaches the limits of the mine. But where there is gas, stripping is dangerous. Thomas Riley, who died recently, owes his death to cutting off the sleeves of his shirt and leaving it unbut toned in the back. fine Partridges Djtog.

GUITEAU CASK. A Lively Day corres More In Court The I'll. oner 11 Inolent Miitl Arr cant, and the Kud Is Not Yet. Washington. Dec. 8. As soon as the Criminal Court opened this inorntngGuiteau shouted out, "A crank in Chicago says I talked with him about thisctt.se! I don't know the man. It is false." Colonel Corkhill called an the first witness Mrs. Julia M. Wilson, of Leadville, Col. She knew L. W. (Juiteau from her earliest recollection. He was her uncle. Witness gave a most feelirg account ot the life and chaiacter of her mother, Mn. Maynard, (who it had been alleged b the deLjnse had died insane, but who really died from pneumonia in 1?.V.) Her mother was noted for her 1 v I dispo sition and Christian character, aud her vir tues are remembered and xikt n ot to this day. Witness was her nurse and constant at endant-up to the time of hei death, and never saw the sughttst indication of flighti- ness or insanity. ltness was questioned in rela Ion to the evidence of Uavi', one of the witnesses for he defense. Davis testified that ke wad at one time in Mrs. Maynard's room auring iier last illness, and she was very fiightyaud incoherent, and continually charged him (U.ms) to rook mit for her husband and children, for she fen red they wouia go to me i'oor House. Tl;e witness (Mrs. Yilon) smiled iijoredulouiiy while the question was being put and teplied she uia not even remember the man Davis. The dep K-ition f Mr. Turner wasnad, in which he said: '"I have heari hcrhuoai,d say she died insane," and witness was ques tioned in regarJ to it. Scoville objected to tue reply, "l never heard of it." ani a lively uiscussion ensuea oeiween juage Porte rand cjcoviile. Guiteau became nraged at Judge rorter and shouted, ''Now hold your thun der till you get lo iha J'iry, Judt , you are doing t .is sort of thing too much.'' Judge Poner, without noticing the outburst, con tinued in the most impressive mani.er to argue bis joint, when Guiteau broke out again: "I'm not a crimiral and I won't be till convicted. 1 won t have thst word You just hold your elvjuii.ce till vou ret at tue jury. Scoville expostulated with him, b;it he retorted in the most vicious manner, 3hut up and mind your business, I Ln-v what I'm doing." Witness was questioned in re gard to various members of the family, and stated positive y that she never ?aw indica tions of liiia -ity in any ot ihem. Speaking oi me prisoner s tamer, u. .uuueau, the witiies said: "My uncle Luther viited me very frequently, and I loved In m nub verv A I V " lt ' lenuer auec ion. our wnoic lanuiv were delighted with his lovely ChrUt is i charac ter. ana such a mougm mil m- angnt l n anv degree be of unsound mind never en tered my head." Witness was subjected to a close ana critical cross-examination. She was asked ii bhe, entertained any prejudice against having Leredi ary insanity alleged in the defense, anu replied: ,-l cbjeot to any unfair statements being made uj on that subject. Perhaps lor the sake ot my children I might dislike to h ive it t.et up, f r myself facts can make nodiüerence. Her evidence in chief remained unshaken, and her testi mony produced a marked senatioii. At the conclusion of Mrs. Wilsou's testi mony John W. Guiteau arose from his seat next the prisoner and asked the Court to rule out the question relative to the witness' father having died of ofiening of t'ie brain. "I can not see, your Honor," continued Guiteau, '"the occasion for dragging in peo ple who have no blood ' relation Ith the prisoner." JudjeCox I think the matter irrelevant. Guiteau Mrs. Wilson settus to be a very bright lady, but she is opposed to having it appear there is any insanity in the family; that's the matter with her testimony. Scoville here arose, trembling with excite ment, and protested ogainst the meddling of John A. Guiteau in the case. "He is op posed to showing insanity in the family," said Scoville, and his voice was here drowned by the prisoner, who struck his hand vio lently on the table and shouted, "So do I. He had better get back to Boston. He has got no business here. Just because he hap pens to bear the same name he thinks 1 will get a little notoriety out of this case. 1 haven't known anything about the man for years. That's all there is about him, and I want him to get right out of this case." Colonel Corkhill called George C, Mayn ard, who verified in several material points the testimony of the preceding witness. The Court was about to announce the usual re cess, when John W. Guiteau arose and said: "Your Honor, 1 greatly desire to make a personal explanation. My father is dead " Guiteau broke in, interrupting him: "Oh, shut up and sit down. You have been vin dicated." Davidge here objected to any more side scenes, lhe prisoner had continually been allowed to interrupt the proceedings, and at this rate the trial would soon become a farce. Judge Cox I see no occasion, Mr. Gui teau, for any explanation on your part. Recess. TESTIMONY KKSCMED. After recess Frank Bartlett, of Chicago, was called. He knew Mr. and Mrs. Scoville, and had met the prisoner at Scoville's sura ner residence in 1879. "This man never saw me but once," inter rupted Guiteau. "It has cost the Govern ment $200 to bring this man down here. He met me once five years ago; that's all he knows about me. It's an outrage, Cork hill, for you to waste the money of the Gov ernment in this kind of way." Witness saw Guiteau daily and never noticed anything out of the way in his de portment. The gentlemen there engaged in a tub-race, ar.d Guiteau took part, when he uptet. He was ducked by the rest of the gentlemen, and took it in good part. Gui teau again broke out impatiently, "What's that got to do with what took place the 2d of July, Corkhill? I had time to gocrasy a hundred times since this man saw me. That shows what stupid work is being done by the prosecution. If you bad to pay for this instead of the tax-payers, you would do differently." The witness never saw any indications of insanity in the prisoner. Mrs. Florence It. Bartlett, wife of the pre vious witness, witnessed the dog incident so often alluded to by defense, and saw noth ing unusual in the occurrence. She thought at the time that Mrs. Scoville was more ex cited about it than the prisoner was, and re membered distinctly that the prisoner, after the dog was hurt, carried food to him, and seemed to desire to efface any bad impres sion it might have created. Witness de tected no signs whatever of any mental dis turbance in the prisoner. He was always polite and behaved as a gentleman. On cross-examination Scoville asked: "Do you remember once at the table a discussion upon some religious topic arose, and Guiteau took part and beoamp so violent that they all left himr ' A. Ho, I do no1. Guiteau They all got through talking, and so they left: that's all there was to that. I think we have bad about enough of this dog business. Howard Danham, of Boston, took the stand, but Guiteau forestalled his evidence' by shouting: "I had dsk room with that jam a few weeks in Boston, and that's all he knows about it. It has cost the Government $100 to get him here." Witness stated that on November 18, 1879, the prisoner secured desk room in his otttce, and remained there nearly two months, when, as he was behind with rent, and wit ness did not like the style of the man, he lequested him to surrender his key. The prisoner told witness there was no money in lueoiugy, anu uc niuguiug io pracuue law. Colonel Corkhill then offered a letter written by Guiteau to witness last June. Scoville objected, on the ground that the burden of proof rested with the Government. The plea of inanity having been set up bv the defense, the prosecution can not at this time introduce any evidence to establish the sanity of the prisoner. It should be intro duced in the evidence in chief. The Judge Well. 1 overrule the objec tion. Scoville I desire to note an exception generally and to all evidence of this kind. Davidge From this time out? Guiteau Running away back all through the case, Judge? A letter was read.; It was dated Iligss tiouse, June 8, and contained a request, for a copy of his book, "Truth," which he de sired should be sent bim. as he was getting out a rcvied edition., The witness stated that in all hii connection with tue prisoner, throuch all his relations with him and his observations of his conduct, he never sus pected any insanity in the prisoner. Guiteau You thought I was badly cracked on my book, though. Then to the audience he added: "This man is a Metho dist minister; that's what'." the matter with him. I did not pay my rent, and so he did not like me." Witness then gave the substance of a con versation he had had with J. W. Guiteau, in which the latter said: ' The disgrace of this crime is enough for the familv to bear without endeavoring to prove heieditary in sanity, tor there is no authenticated ca-e on which to base it." Guiteau (greatly excited) shouted out: "That's the way he feels, and I desire to re pudiate him on this business. He has never been a brother to me in any sene, and that isjust a ridiculous view he takes on this in sanity business." A moment after he shouted: "That's false. There are two of my cousins in the Lunatic Asylum now, and that's where I'll probably be very soon." John Palmer, of Saratoga Springs, testified that Guiteau boarded a week with him, and ran away without paying his board Guiteau Well, I might have confessed hat and saved the Government $100. DEPOSIT ION OF THE PRE I DENT. The District Attorney here sent Judsre Cox a communication received by him from I the FreMdent of the United States. The Judge, after reading it, sent it to Scoville, with the remark that the naner contained the President's answer to his (Scoville's) in- f lerrogaiones. The prisonor I had sent the President a note tlin afternoon, requesting him not io apjear m the case, and saing I did not want his answers to the interrogatories I presume he sent tbem before he sot my note. Scoville read the answers of President Arthur to the fmt jind second Questions. whether he knew tin- prisoner, and how often he had seen him. The President re plied that he knew hlra; that, he has seen him at least ten times and josib!y twenty times. To the question as to whether he had ever conversed with him. he renlied None, excepting to. return the ordinarv salutation of the day, and once or twice in answer to his request to be employed in the campaign as a Sfeaker bv the Republican State Committee, of which 1 was Chairman.'' To the question. "What political services had the prisoner rendered the Republican party during the last Presidential ea ni- paign?" the answer is. "None that I know of." The fifth uuestvin was whether ihcro was anything in the t-risoner's relations to h im sei f nr to nanant nn - f Conkling, or any other of the Republican . . , v . . v. t.i ' 1 niui party, socially or politically, to furnish him with any ground for supposing he would re ceive any political preferment. The answer is, "No." Tne prisoner That is a matter of opinion. The last question was: "Di I vou ever t?i ve him any reason to think he could have any political or personal influence with vou?" Th answer is: "l never did?" Prisoner He never had occasion to. The President add to his answers the fol lowing: "I have been requested bv the counsel for the defend to produce a letter written by the prisoner since his indictment. That letter was received by me in Octob-r last, and was not preserved; do not recollect its contents particularly, excepting it con tained sme claim of his having rendered some importaut service to the' Republican party during the presidential camnaicn. and an appeal for a 'jostponement of his trial, to give him time to prepare for the de- fortco The prisoner That is all there was to it. The next witness was Rev. R. A. Mr Ar thur, pastor of Calvary Baptist Church, New York. As soon as he was sworn the prisoner remarked: "I know Dr. McArthur verv well. He is a nice, fine fellow; very high-toned in even wav. I owe him $95.' : The witness began to relate how the prisoner introduced ;hlmself and wife to him (witness) at close of service oi.e Sun day, and at the same time pre ented a letter of d is minion from the First Baptist Church, Chicago. The prisoner stated at that time in Chicago he had had a lucrative practice of law, but owing to disasters following the fire, his practice had entirely, or in a good part, gone. Now he and his wife had come to New York tp start life afresh. My heart went out to him, and I kindly introduced him and his wife to men of prominence in society and In Church relations, at.d I know I was of service to him. The letter which he brought was referred, as is our custom, to a Committee. The Chairman of that Committee was a gentleman of very high standing, at one time Indian Commissioner under the United States Government, and who took an Interest " Here the witness was Interrupted by Sco ville, who remarked that all this was very interesting but entirelv irrelevant. He did not want this entire hish-rv. The Distilct Attorney But I do want the whole history connected with the prisoner. The prisoner It is all interesting and im portant. Dr. McArthur is a very tine gen tleman. I owe hlra 95 and I am sorry I can't pay him now. Then, add retting the witness, he said; "Allow me to say, Doctoi, there is some possibility of my getting 5,000 from James Gordon Bennett for that Herald disability matter, and I propose to send you a check for $U5 the moment I get it Scoville remarked that he objected to the witness stating the qualifications of some uua'"" uiavumminee not snowing now far he might g i in that history. The prisoner Doctor McArthur is an ora tor, as you may see by.ihe way he talks riiauh-.l Witness resumed his story, and told of the prisoner and wife being received into fel lowship of the Church, and of his wife later asking urgently for moiiev, handing him a promissory no'e of the prisoner for $100. n ivMeave von Pot tDat promissory Witness -NO; T did not think it negotia ble and ha. e not preserved it. A laugh During the political campaign of that fall the prisoner was not seen at our meetings so often, and the reason assigned by him was (the phrase he ned), he had gone to some degree into politics, and he expected an office as a result of these political excite ments. Prisoner I took some interest in Horace Greely in 1872. District Attorney Do you recolleot the office he expected? Prisoner I did not expect any office at that time. Colonel. ; Witness My impression is the ofllce was Minister to Chili. ; Prisoner-Nothing of , the kind. I think it csible I may have mentioned the Swiss Mhsion.

The pr soner That was the time I com mit ted adultery s I might get a divorce. mat was an there was in it, I was not going to live all my life with a woman I did not like. I had no business marrying her at all. The witness (ignoring the interruption) -And about the 30th of April, 1875, he was summoned 10 appear before the Advisory Committee to answer to the charge of im morality. 1 here were three counts to the chirge. Firt, he took money which bis wiie earned by working in a hotel in the country, and which was remitted him to asist in suprorting him. Prisoner (interrupting) That is abso lutely fale. Doctor, I never heard that story before. Witness (still ignoring the interruption) And spent it in improper relations with other women. Prisoner (with excitement) That is ab solutely false. If my wife told you that she t ld a lie. The witness (continuing his nar rative). The second count adds: "He has been guilty by frequent acts of violation of his marriage vow." The pri-oner (again breaking in) I only married that wuman on ten hours' notice, anil that is reason enough why I could not live with her. Witness The third count was that as a result those repeated acts of infidelity ho was suffering from a vile and loathsome di seise. Prisoner That is false. The witness Those charges were re cited to the prisoner by myself, in the nrpsnro nf tha P,imrr.ill " The prisoner That's erroneous. I beg to differ from you. The Court (severely )- Keep quiet; let the witness go on. Witness I recited those charges to the prisoner, and he acknowledged the truth of every one of them. He stated as his excuse that his wife was absent, that nature's demand must be met, and he could not re sist the enticements of lewd women on the street. He was pressed to know whether he felt a sense of guilt whether there was any consciousness of remorse or repentance for the past, or any promise of reform action for the future. The Church was disposed to do fairly. The gentlemen onjthat Committee were gentlemen who were above anything like unfairneness toward any person. Prisoner in spite of Scoville's efforts to repres him) -I remember this; I take bark my contradiction to what the Doctor aid, because, unon thinking it over. I find it is correct. The men on that Committee said they had been in the same boat them t selves, and for that reason they felt sympa thetic, iney thought if a man had been unfortunately married he had a right to get out of it. Scoville objected to the evidence as en tirely inadmissible, and the Court sus tained the objection. The prisoner (excitedly) I never bad but one interview with him (alluding to wit ness ). I recall it now. I was formally excommunicated and let the whole thing go by default because I was in Chicago. I have been strictly virtu ous for six or seven years. Mark that down. You are picking my whole record from m- tancy, and 1 say it is an outrage on decency. iMsmciy Attorney we present this tes timony because we want to show that what the defense calls insanity is nethitig more than devilish depravity. It was with some difficulty that the ap plause which greeted this remark could be quelled, and the Marshal led out of the Court room a lad particularly noisy, the Court stating that upon any reoccurrence of applause he would order the room cleared. When order had been re stored the witness resumed his testimony and said that it never occurred to him for a moment that the prisoner was other than sane. Scoville proceeded with the cross-examination, questioning the witness more especially as to the fact of his receiving a promissory note for $100 from Guiteau. The prisoner throughout the examination on this point kept a running discussion with the witness, counsel and Court. The Court repeatedly ordered him to keep quiet and allow the witness to speak, but he continued in his denunciation of the prosecution for its "impertinence in raking up my old record." Scoville also became indignant and angry at the prisoner's outbreaks, which pre vented him from finishing his Question, and severs! times declared to him: "I will clear wv. biiuo utiai t v out if you don't stop. You must be still." You must be still. But neither the Court nor counsel could repress the prisoner. When the cro-ss-examination vas closed, the prisoner, looking up at the clock, an nounced it was 3 o'clock and time to go home. He also inquired "How many more witnesses like that nave you got, Corkhill? I think it is an outrage on the public. If you had to pay some of that money your self, you would go slow." Adjourned.
