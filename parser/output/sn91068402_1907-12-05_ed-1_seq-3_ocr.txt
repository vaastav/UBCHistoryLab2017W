Are Among Theeofaut Not Such Undertakings as the Telegraph, tht Telephone, the Street Cars or Gai mi ElectrU Lighting True Nature of a Public Franchise. By ARTHUR WILLIAMS, President National Electric Light associa tion. Some thiegg are so essential;? of a governmental nature that It would be fatuous to consider them from the standpoint of private ownership Among these are the collection of cus toms, the maintenance and direction of the army and navy and the police pow er. In others It is the end rather than the means that should be sought, and municipal and private ownership are often on equal terms without the viola tion of any economic principle The maintenance of public h.-ghwaya and sewers Is usually a public func tion, but the country abounds in exam ples, every whit as satisfactory, or pri vate ownership and operation. With water the importance to the communi ty lie3 not in Its ownership, whether public or private but rather in its qual ity, quantity and price. Many of the most satisfactory waterworks of this country and Kurope are owned pri vately. Beyond these there 13 a class of pub lic utilities which experience has shown should lie exclusively within the domain of private enterprise. The telegraph, tel ephone, transportation, gas and electric light undertakings offer examples. The ownership of these by the community is advoc ited by some on the ground that thej' are necessities of modern life, by others because they partake of the nature of monopoly. It does not appear that either is a sufficient rea son. These are facilities and conven iences, not necessities. The latter con sist of simple dwellings, food, raiment and means of warmth in winter. If our necessities are to be municipalized, we should begin with the butcher, gro cer, baker and coal dealer, whose per centage of profits far exceeds that of any of the corporations in the so called public service. Monopoly regulated monopoly Is not necessarily opposed ta the public interest. It is advantageous to all to have one telephone system, that from one point all may be conveniently reached; to have one street car sys tem with universal transfers, making unnecessary any relation between one's home and place of work; to have a single gas or electric light works, pre venting the waste of small plants and organizations and securing by the lar ger development Increased reliability and improved quality in the service. A franchise merely permits a public service corporation to share with oth ers the use of the streets for the de livery to Its customers of the comniod lty it supplies a right that Is enjoy ed by every other industry. The dif ference is merely one of method. Were electricity delivered in storage bat terles and gas in tanks conceivable ways no franchise would be required. Instead of using horses and wagons which blockade the streets and make street cleaning a problem, deliveries are made beneath the surface without dirt, noise or other objectionable fea tures. It is through the exercise of this right that we hear of the confiscation of public property. Yet the public has not parted with its title to the streets nor its right to occujjy them for any purpose or in any manner it may de sire. It has simply permitted a serv ice company to become a tenant, for which, in the form of franchise and other taxes, the company pas's a high rent Substantially the city Is the landlord, possessing the power of arbi trarily determining, in the form of these taxes, what rent shall receive. And this rent lessens proportionately the individual taxation. Moody's Mag azine. Typical Case of City Bookkeeping. The authorities of Lakewood, O., have charged the city $35 a year for the street lights supplied by the municipal plant. After looking at their tax bills some of the citizens came to tlie con clusion that this sum did not represent all the cost and called in a firm of ex pert accountants, who ascertained that the actual annual cost per arc had been $129.5G for the seven years the plant had been in operation, although the lights had been run 0:1 t'.ie moon light schedule. As a private com pany offers all night service for less than half that amount, the experiment is not regarded as a success, except by the lighting committee. When Tom's Tune Would Chanqe. Of course mun'cipal ownership would be liked by am- political lt:;s wh, owns a citv. at- Tom Johno:i own Cleveland.

MansfiehrtO.l News'. Unfair Distribution of Cost. A special dispatch from Kirkwood, Mo. to the Chicago In buna states that the municipal lectric light plant of that city has proved a failure. The generating plant will be shut down, and electricity will be purchased from a private company at one-third of what it has cost the city to make it. The city will sell to its customers at a price high enough to enable it to light the streets without cost to the tax payers. This is typical of municipal ownership inequity to force the users of electricity to pay for all the street lighting, although . they aie not bene fited any more than the citizens who use gas or oil. Failure of Municipal Bakeries. The failure of the municipal buk wies at Catania, Italy, is reported by Mr. Churchill, the British consul at Talermo. There was a $30,000 deficit In the balance sheet, and the request governing a loau of ?S0.000 was re fused by a royal commission. In con sequence the ' institution has been closed.

Let your com petitor waste his money on advertis ing, and perhaps in this way you'll soon "put him out of business." Fix his clock for him. Just stand back and laugh at him when you see him squandering his money for printer's ink. One there was a boy named John -we think his last name was Wananiaker.or maybe it was Money maker, auvhow his name was John with some sort a maker attached to his name. He owned 500 yards of calico, three pairs of pants, a half dozen pairs of boots. He called this a drv iroods store and offered to sell a pair of socks for 37 cents. The dnn't-beliovo-in-advertisin" m e r - chants laughed. Young John spent f Go with the Philadelphia Ledger to advertise just one time and had less than 100 worth of goods. He was continued bv the merchants who "know it didn't pay!" It was through sympathy that they offered him ad- vice, liut jonn (lion i iisren io ruoui, and went and blew his money in fool ishly; and today poor John sees the result of his misdoings he has so many largo dry goods stores that he can 'hardly find time to study his Sunday-school lesson. -- Mr. Bryan has the honesty and the magnanimity to declare that he is not going to blame the President or a Republican administration lor the money stringency now existing.

Because of the absence of E. J. Jus tice, who had a law suit to try in Asheville, tho railroad rate investi gation ca.-e in Raleigh was continued for several days to suit this gentle man's wishes and convenience. Ac cording to the Raleigh Evening Times of Nov. 26th, Standing Master Mont gomery was quite vexed when ho learned why request had been made or a continuance. ith six or seven lawyers he thought the State had enough to proceed without Mr. Jus tice. Judge Montgomery is quoted as follows: 'If I had known," declared Standing Master Walter Montgomery today, "that this case was asked to he put off because of the absence of one attorney. I would never have agreed to it. 1 lie taking of evidence is of too great a magnitude to be continued at the request of one man who has a law suit on hand at Ashe ville." These remarks were made today by the master to Capt. W. H. Day, attorney for Seaboard Air Line Railway, and were heard by a reporter of the Evening Times. "The State, continued Master Mont gomery, uas six or seven attorneys. The postponement was requested by ex Govrnor Aycock and agreed to by Mr. Thorn, chief counsel for the Southern.

"One of the most serious problems that confronts the newspaper pub lishers of thecouutry, especially those of the smaller dailies and weeklies, is the impending increase in the price of print paper, which -will probably be doubtly be double what it now is. There will be few outside the strong est of the minor publications that will be able to weather the storm and continue the present price of subscrip tion. The greatest to suffer will un doubtedly be those weeklies whose proprietors several years ago injudi ciously reduced tho price of subscrip tions 'from $ 2 and $1.50 to 1.00." says the Decatur Herald. This unfortunate cut in price oc curred when the country was in the clutches of hard times, and the peo ple were not able to pay their bills. When prosperity struck the country, and prices of all classes of commod ities natually went up, the price of the country weekly was kept at one dollar, and now every subscription taken at that price is well-nigh a fi nancial loss. There is but one thing for small publishers to do and that is to in crease the price of their pa pers. They should not expect to make the advance Ies9 than fifty cents on 1 subscrip tions, and the same amount on -1.-30 rates. No man can publish a decent week ly newspaper nowadays at 1.00, and no subscriber ought to expect to get a paper for that sum.

"Tenderness, humbleness, courtesy, self forget fulness, faith, sympathy these ornaments of a meek and quiet spirit are learned at the fireside in common-place houses scattered o7er thp country, or in city streets" Henry Drummomh Another is found in the closingsen t.eneos of an address by our Presi dent ou the recent occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Michigan Agricultural College. I le would le pleased if all that our bril liant, truth-loving President said on that occasion could be put before pur. readers. We ought, every one of us, to know just what he did say t here. It all honors labor and the foundation principles to which we ns a groat nation, owe our prosperity, bin for present use we must take the few t-Tosing sentences. Ilesa3's: uXoth inir oiitside of home can take the place of home. The school is an in valuablo adjunct to the home, but it is a wretched substitute for it. The family relation is the most funda mental, the most important of all relations. No leader in church or State, in science or art or industry, however great his achievement, does work which compares in importance with that of the fathers and the moth ers, who a ro the first of sovereigns and the most divine of priests."

Sold at Parker's Two Drug Stores.' Unprecedented, Certainly. Hotuhport Herald. . ; Unprecedented scenes were enacted in the Senate chamber of the historic cupitol of Alabama when the stat utory prohibition bill was passed. Women and children thronged the corrridors and gallery and even usurped the floor itself, pushing tho Senators from their seats and giv ing vent to their enthusiasm by shouts and cheers that echoed and re-echoed throughj the buildings. Senators who opposed the bill were hissed down when they arose to speak against t he measure and Lieu tenant (lovernor Cray, the presiding officer of the senate was forced to re prove the spectators." The above is part of a news item sent out the day after the prohibi tion bill, making the entire State of Alabama "dry" after Jan. 1st.. 10!), passed the senate after being over whelmingly carried in tht house. "Unprecedented scenes!'" Well, we should think so. Better "disgrace ful scone;;." Tho very thought of such scenes m the State onate cham ber, participated in by women and children is sickening. The passage of the State prohibition measure Js alright, but when women and chil dren usurp the offices of their State senators why not lot the men step down and out and givoup their seats to tho female sex? Not loss disgrace ful than the invasion of tho senate chamber was the hissing down of those members who had courage enough to endeavor to express their convictions v. opposition to tne prohibition measure. "Sweet land of liberty" indeed, when one cannot bo allowed to express his opinion without the ridicule of the public be ing brought down upon his head by a lot of women and children. e hope that when the North Carolina Legislature comes to vote on this State prohibition question next ses sion, if it does, that no such "scenes" as the above will bo enacted. More good can be accomplished when criti cism and redicule by the enaction of such a "show" is left off.

Bad Negroes North and South. Washington dispatch. There are approximately eight times as many negro criminals in the North in proportion to the negro population as there are in theSouth. This statement is so remarkable that it would be beyond belief did not the unpityiug and impartial statistics of the census bureau prove it. Ilere are two examples: In the group of states composed of the New England states and New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey mere were approximately 42G.00U negroes in li)0. During that year 5,192 negroes were committed to prison in those states. This shows that there were l,2Vi negroes committed to prison to every 100,000 in those states. During the same year, iu the group of states consisting of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ten nessee, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana and Mississippi, the negro popula tion aggregated C,420,0OO,and 8,052 negroes were committed to prison in these states during the year which is about. 12o for each 100,000 ne groes within the enumerated states.

Raleigh Evening Times. Without fear of or reference to the probability of a, war with Japan or any otherc.ountry.tbe ftoning- Times is always for a big, strong navy. W e are the greatest people on the face of the earth, our couutry as a nation stauds at the head of the class of governments and our navy should not be second to any m the world. Nothing is more remarkable m the history of the development of arma ment than the strides made by the American navy. From its first in ception in a message of President Arthur to the present time it has been one of the marvels of national re sourcefulness. The figures prepared bv the navv department, giving the relative tonnage of the navies of the powers, shows that the navy of Uncle Sam ranks next to that of Great Britain, with third place allotted to it when consideration is had of the ships Great Britaiu, Franco aud the United States are now building. 1 he situation is highly satisfactory to all persous who appreciate the needs of this country,but even so the ques tion is pertinent" as to whether the navy of the United States is yet suf ficiently large it is, if is not strong enough to secure the outlying posses sions niu to patrol the extensive coast line, it needs to be added to. The sailing of the fleet to the Pa cific has revealed the paucity of ships as compared with the demands for their service. The enormous stretch of water that lies between San Fra- cisco and the Philippines, or rather the Asiatic continent, for thus lar must the strength of the naval arm of the country be felt, calls for a fleet adequate to meet all emergencies. At the same time the Atlantic should have a sufficient fleet to meet any condition t hat may arise. Although everything is at present serene iu tho relations of cms country with its European neighbors, the war cloud is sometimes engendered very rapid ly, and the vast wealth of the Atlan tic seaboard calls for the amplest protection. Congress may be expected to be engaged with several subjects relevant to naval armament. The possible call for the return of the ships sent to the Pacific would precipitate a general discussion of the subject of the navy in relatiou to tho nation s outlook. The policy that has been entered upon is one that will not be receded from. 1 he United States stands committed before the world to the policy of patrolling the Pacif ic, aud t his will be done. At the same time more ships are required in order that the Atlantic seaboard shall be properly cared for. So that it is not unlikely that the nation's necessities may in the near faturegive it assured place in the second rank as a naval power. .

This fact is recognized by all. If it were not so business men would not pay for good space when adver tising under the head of "Boy Want ed" to say "no cigarette smoker need apply." If cigarettes were good for boys the teachers iu the schools would not put the cigarette under the ban as they do. The law makers taking note of the evil effect of cigar ettes on boys, have made it unlawful to sell cigarettes to boys under sev enteen years bf age. Judge Jas. L. Webb in his charge to the grand jury last Monday, referred to the law in regard to selling cigarettes to boys, and spoke of their evil effects on the boy. Hoys all over this couutry are smoking the little "coffin tacks." We do not believe ourjnerchants wil fully violate the law in regard to the sale of eigarett.es, but the boys are getting them some how or other. The grand jury will do its duty in this matter and look after the viola tors of the law in regard to the sale of cigarettes to the boys. We have no fuss to make about the general use of tobacco, although we can see no good in its use in any form, but cigarettes are deadly to' a bov. It simply kills him out, that's what the cigarette does for a boy. Prof. Biv ens, superintendent of the Monroe graded schools said, in reference to what Judge Webb said in his charge aoouc tne illegal sale of cigarettes, that there are a number of bova in his school who smoke cigarettes away from the building and grounds oi course and not one of the cigar ette smokers is keeping ud with his class. Iet the law against selling cigarettes to boys be enforced. The cure for the cigarette smoking bov is well we do not believe in faith cure, me laying ou oi hands and all that kind of stuff generally speaking. Danger in Asking Advice.

Influence of Home. Chicago Inter-Ocean. Men have come from half around the globe, enduring pain nnd discom fort in every degree, merely that they might die amid scenes familiar and loved in childhood in the old town, or on the old farm, or i l the old house. Aud however wandering bis death falls, and although it may find him with heart at ease, there is prob ably no man before whose dying eyes there does not come some vision of the homely things and familiar faces he knew a3 a little child. Here is a mystery whose meaning is undeclared of men. Perhaps the soul, though confident in the light of faith, and so unafraid of the work before it. vet turns back to stay it self upon the things first known when it came from the dark From wnicn we all come and into which we all go, even as a bird flitting from the night through a lighted hall and out into the night again. Perhaps the wheel oi earthly nto turns full circle, und that the ap pointed place and state for the flight into worlds unknowu is that at which legan the earthly pilgrimage. 'erhans this is one of the meanings of the saying, "Except ye be as little children." We do not and we ctutuot know. But we do know, nnd it is a nowledge which gives to all men n dnshin. that when the last hour ap proaches, and the light of earth fades ' before the dying eyes, the heart of man turns homeward, and finds, it mavbe. in the homo of childhood a type of that house eternal in the heav ens to which hope and faith aspire.

He has not the faculty for accumulating moneyjyou could notpnss laws enough to make nmrich financially. 1 lie exceptional man is made to make monej; money seems to stick to his fingers, nnd you could not keep him poor. The life- ustorv of the man who has lived au unsullied lifo and died poor is one of uneventifulness. He is generally generous hearted, and never nspires to enrich umiself.

Out of his modest earnings he will probably save enough to pay for his modest home seldom more, lie gives his children a common school education aud starts thein out in t he world with a "God bless you" for their dower. He is honorable in his dealings; he pays his debts; he works hard and speuds littlA lor luxuries. He seldom complains of his lot; and never knowingly commits a crime against the Stato or humanity. He loves much and laughs more. He may put by a few dollars for his old age but oftener not. When ho dies, men say of him: "He was an honest man and a good citizen. We shall miss lain." There is nothing start ling in the story, nothing to exploit; just the story of an average man, one of the salts of the earth. Vi e all know or knew him or his kind.
