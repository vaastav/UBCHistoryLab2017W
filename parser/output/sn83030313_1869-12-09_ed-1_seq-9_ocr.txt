The year will close out wlt" a steadier aud more cliceriul feeling m inei cant^e circles, in consequence of Cieneral Grant's and Sec retary Boutweli'a position. The money market to- j day was acttvc up to two o'clock. Previous to thik' liour the rule on call, with pledge even of govern ment collaterals, was fun seven per cent, Hie Ger nian bankers being lar?re borrowers, for ttie purpose, it is supposed, of currying the bonds bought to catcU the rise In me foreign market. There was also a disposition to inako tluie en gagements for periods running from thirty to sixty days. Toward the clo.se ot banking hours the market was Irregularly reported, borrowers and lenders seeming Lot to meet cach other, so that in some portions of tuo street six per cent was the rate, while in others It was still sharp seven. The reason ol this doubtless lies In the partial disbursements of the Hub-Treasury in payment of the bonds bought this noon, the sellers who got their money late In the day beinc anxious to place It over, night, and hence oilerlug down this market. Commercial paper was steady and without new feature. Prime names were current at nine to twelve per cent, and Inferior grades at twelve to eighteen per cent, accoidiug to time and endorsement. The government bond market was unfavorably affected by a heavy uccline in London, where the 61's at Ave o'clock this evening had fallen to 86^, owing, It Is coujectured, to the disappointment of foreign speculators at the tenor of the President's message, which, from the outcry fraised by the press of this country just succeeding the gold p'anlcof Sep tember, they thought would take strong grounds In favor of an early resumption of specie payments. We have often adverted to the curious influences of the [wo markets upon c ich other?that Is, the home and loreign. 110 wover complex ibese lntlucuces it is always certaiu that a decline abroad leaas to a decline here. The difference between gold and green.?ack quotations is, ol course, the reasou of this mificacy. Tue inherent strength given domestic prices by the conservative character of the policy of General Grant and Secretary lJoutwcll combated the efTec'.a ot the foreign decliue, especially as the gold market was no strong. The jielJiug here was a quarter to ihree-eigi.ths per ccnt only as con trasted with a fa 1 ol over a half to three-quarters per ccnt in London. The lact further illustrates what lias been remarked above aa to the steadying influences of the President's uies.siigo upon the gen eral market. The agents of foreign bankers in this cliy have not profiled as largely as they expected, if they have at. all, oy their rcccnt purchases of gov ernments to realize the advance predicted upon ex pected specie payment recommendation* in the Con gressional documents. Tito market at the close was heavy, particularly ou the announcement that a bill had been Introduced to make the national banking system free. Whatever strength had been commu nicated by the oiler of ihc government to buy two millions or bonds to-day was counterbalanced by the large offerings at tho hub-Treasury, where the total of the'proposals to sell was over live and a half mil lions. The following were the closing street prices this ovening:?United .States currency sixes, 107^ a 108; do. sixes, 1)81, registered, fl4 a 114.>?; do., do., coupon, 118'* a lis.',,; do. five-twenties, registered, May and November, 112X a 113; do. do., 1862, cou pon, do., 115 a 116do., uo., 1864, do., do., U23? a 113; do., do., 1SC5, do., do., 113 a 113>?; do., do., registered, January and July, 111}* a 112; do., do., 1S65, coupon, do., 116,s? a 115X; do., do., 1867, do., do., 116a 11fi\; do., do., 1868, do., do., 115% a lis5,; do., ten forties, registered, 1U8 a 108V; do., coupon, 108'.' a 10*74. The gold market was #roug and active, the price rising to 124. The bull movement predicted in the beginning of the week has l-een maintained, as.tho gradual advanco each day Indicates. The "bulls" are encouraged to persevere, owing to the abseuco of contraction idea* in the public documents and to the chance that Congress will expand rather than diminish the volume of currency, especially as the two most prominent members have already intro duced measures to make toe privileges of national banking irec to the whole country. The "bears," on the contrary, are selling in expectation of the large outcome of gold from the Treasury in payment of the January interest, and upon the flattering charac ter of our exports 01 cotton and produce, and the corresponding weakness of exchange. The range of the gold market to-day was as follows:? 10 A. M 123X 1:50 P. M 124 1(J:7 A. M 128* IF.li 12 11 A. M 123* 3 P. M 1*4 12 II UBSi 6 P. M 124 1 P. M m'a 6:3U P.

The advance was quiio remarkable tu St. I'aul, Heading, the Van derollt securities and Pacific Mail. Wit* reference to St. I'aul, altUoustn the meeting of the director* docs not occur uncu next mouth, the dividend on the preferred is reported to liavo been fixed at seven per cent cash aud three per cent new com mon stock, and on tnc common at four per ccnt cash and six per cent scrip, l he books of Northwest closed this altcruoun and quotation* to-night are ex dividend. The comuion sold as high as 73, equal to about 76J4 with the dividend, which, though four *per cent, seemed to be rated as worth only three and seveu-eighths per ccnt lu consequence of its carry ing the liability to government tax. In the miscella neous railways Chicago and Alion was weak, owlug to the acLtou of the directors lu proposing tnc l^sue of fifty per cent new stock, one-half to be paid for at par by the stockholders accepting the dividend. Of course the action ot the directors requires the sanction of a vote of the stockholders, who gene rally owpectcd tna simple Issue of loo per cent new slock, the equivalent process of doubling the capital of the road. In the more actlvc railways hock Island and Lake Shore were heavy and failed to keep up with their Western rivals, St. i'aul and Northwc?t. ? Heading sold a9 high as 9J%. The express stocks were again buoyant with the progress of cold weather, which, by closing navigation, stim ulates the business of the railway express lines. Adams' rose to 60% and American to 40. In the mining list Quicksilver sold at 18, but reacted later in the day. Pacific Mall was active and touched 52%, but ulso fell oir towards the close of business.
