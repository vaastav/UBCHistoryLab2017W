Purchase City Supplies From Favored Firms ARMY OFFICERS FIGHT DEVOL'S PROMOTION 'Hen Closer to Top Say They Will Not Be "Jumped" Without Entering Protest PULLING WIRES AT WASHINGTON Several Veterans in Service Struggle to Gain Billet of Quartermaster General The proposed advancement of Major Carroll A. Devol to the position of <juarterma«ter general of the United States army, Is meeting with much opposition and disapproval on the part of the officers In line for promo : tlon over "whom Devol Is to be "Jumped," according to present inten tions. Among: the number xrho will combat the. promotion of Major Devol is Col onel William S. Patten. Colonel Patten Is hurrying home from the Philippines to go to Washing ton, where he -will seek what he thinks Is due him for the gallant services he has performed eince he has been in the army. He ranks fourth in line for the position of quartermaster general. Other officers with the same title who are in line of advancement are Colonel James M. Marshall, Colonel Charles A- H. McCauley and Colonel John L. Clem. Behind these comes a list of nine lieutenant colonels and Sve majors. There is but little question that Major Devol will become the quarter master general, as from reports in Washington he is elated for that posi tion by the President. Before: he Is promoted,' However, there : will be a ; battle* lor the ,\u25a0 place, _as eve ryj officer In the corps who has any "pull" is making a great fight to get the plum. Major Devol was stationed at this port for four years in charge of the transport service. His efficiency as an officer ha* never, been questioned in any way, and his fellow-oflicers all agree that he has handled the trans porting of troops between here and the Philippines in a thoroughly satis factory manner^ But •when It comes to the promotion of Devol to the head of the quarter master's department they all- agree to disagree. Each officer in that particu lar line who ranks Devol feels that he should have a "whack" at the big place. Besides Colonel Patten, Colonel John I* Clem feels particularly hurt that he ha* not been given a chance at the billet. Colonel Clem has served In th« army for thirty-five years and has,been in the quartermaster's depart ment since May 4. 18S2. Jle is at pres ent in the East, where. It Is reported, he 1b placing his appeal for the big office before the War Department.
