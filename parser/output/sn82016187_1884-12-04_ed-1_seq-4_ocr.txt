THROUGH XEW ENGLAND. The progress of the Commander-in-Chief through New England was a continuous ovation, which must gratify every com rade. It was not only a well-deserved tribnte to Gen. Kouutz, but splendid testi mony to the fraternal spirit of Down East comrades, and their growing enthusiasm for the noble Order of which he is the honored head. The space we give to a report of the progress to Portland is well-bestowed. Outside of New York City and Brooklyn Blaine's plurality in New York was 08,407.

It has taken more than a year of the hard est kind of hard work to bring the amended Mexican pension bill to the advanced stage it has now reached. In and outside of Con gress the friends of soldiers have been called upon to put forth every effort to secure its progress to the present point. It represents the sifting of several score of pension bills introduced into both Houses of Congress, the accepted recommendations of the Pension Committee of the Grand Army of the Re public, and of the Pension Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives, and the final result of eight mouths of earn est discussion in both Houses, with the con sideration of countless amendments. Looking back over the work that was done on it and the measures incorporated into it, the review is astonishing. Long before Congress met last December the work of preparing pension legislation for it was actively going on. Out of a multitude of plans which comrades were eagerly advocat ing, the Pension Committee of the G.A.R. composed of men of excellent knowledge, judgment and true sympathy with soldier feelings selected and combined until a plan was formulated which seemed to embrace as many of the best features of all as there was a reasonable hope of making successful. Being a compromise, it fell short of what many comrades desired; it was not even what all that any individual member of the Pension Committee desired, but it was all that the Committee as a whole thought could be got. The Pension Committee came on to "Washington and pressed its ideas upon Congress, spending much time and effort in the work. Numberless other bills, origi nated by Members of Congress and by indi viduals and organizations outside of Con gress, were also pressed upon the attention of both branches of the National Legislature. The Pension Committees of the Senate and House had an arduous work put upon them in considering all of these. They at last made their reports, and still more arduous work began on the floors of the Senate and nouse. During the "Winter the germ of the pres ent bill passed each body, growing con tinually by amendments and enlargements. Every time it came up in cither body a flood of new amendments was poured npon it, and its friends had not only to fight its opponents, numerous enough in all con science, but to resist the more insiduous attacks of those who would change it in such a way that its failure would be foredoomed. The Senate, after a long discussion, repeated reference to its Committee on Pensions, amendment in Committee of the "Whole, and in regular session passed the bill as it now stands, and sent it to the House for concur rence. There it had to go through a similar ordeal of discussion and consideration, and, 'after a filibustering contest of singular per tinacity, its final passage was prevented by a motion to postpone its farther considera tion until the reassembling, of Congress this month. This history shows how slender will be the chance of getting any new pension legis lation through the session of Congress which has just begun. At the last session there were many strong influences favoring the success of this kind of legislation which do not op perate now. Most of the Representatives were candidates for re-election, and those from the North and "West were axious to go before their constituents with a good record to " propitiate the soldier element." Now the election is past, many of them were defeated and some are not so desirous of propitiating the soldiers. It was also the eve of the Presidential election, and both parties were very anxious for "soldier votes." Now the election is over. The Democratic party has 153 electoral votes in the Solid South, which it feels it can count upon in any emergency, so that it has not the same reason for being solicitous about the "soldier vote" that it had a few months ago. But above all these adverse influences are the shortness of the time and the crowded condition of the calendars. There is much more important business already before Con gress than it could dispose of by working every day and night from now until the 4th of March. If there was nothing else to en gross its attention it could not clear its dockets before it will expire by Constitu tional limitation. But it will not have an opportunity to work every day and night from now till the 4th of March. The holi days will take up fully two weeks of that time. It now seems very likely that Con gress will visit the New Orleans Exposition, which will dispose of the belter part of another fortnight. Then there will be the dedication of "Washington's Monument, and the preparations for President-elect Cleve land's inauguration, all of which will make heavy inroads upon the legislative time. Then the excitement and turmoil of a change of Administration, with tens of thousands of offices to fill, will inevitably engross the attention of the members of the dominant party to the exclusion of almost everything else. Therefore, it can not help being clear to every one who thinks at all upon these things, that there is but one hope for the soldiers at this session and that is in the passage of the Mexican Pension Bill with amendments. By all uniting in one grand concerted effort, by every soldier in every section of the country arraying himself along with his comrades in a demand for its passage, by pouring in upon the House of Repre sentatives immediately petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of names wo can secure the passage of the bill early in January, before the seething excitement of the last days of the Forty-eighth Congress fairly begins. Its signature by the President will almost surely follow, and thus we will have secured at once an important measure of relief for our unfortunate comrades. If we do not do this, if we attempt any ex periments or amendments or new plans, we will not only defeat this bill, but delay the granting of any other measure of relief for another year. There is but one thing to do, and that is to leave nothing undone that can in any way put a pressure upon the House of Representatives to pass the bill. 

OPENING OF CONGRESS. The last session of the Forty-eighth Con gress began at noon last Monday, with only a moderate number of members in attend ance. In the Senate the credentials of Hon. "Wm. P. Sheffield, who had been appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Senator Anthony, wero presented, and that gentleman sworn in. The President's Mes sage was received and read, Senator Iugalls introduced a bill looking to the summary removal of the fences erected on Government land by the "Steer Kings." Senator An tony's death was announced, appropriate remarks made, and the Senate adjourned. The call of the roll of the House showed 222 of the 325 members to be present. Hon. B. T. Shivcley, of the 13th Indiana District, who wa3 elected to succeed Maj. Calkins, was present and sworn in. No business was done beyond listening to the reading of the Message. Both Houses have an enormous amount of business upon their calendars, aud most of this of great importance, but no one be lieves that more than a fraction of it will be disposed of. The Senate's calendar has over 300 bills, the most important of which are those to appropriate 50,000,000 of money derived from Internal Revenue taxes to educational purposes, to repeal the timber culture act, to establish a bureau of statis tics of labor, to provide means for the sup pression and extirpation of pleuro-pneu-monia and other contagious diseases among domestic animals, to prohibit the mailing of newspapers containing lottery advertise ments, to provide for the inspection of meats for exportation and prohibiting the importa tion of adulterated articles of food or drink, to establish a postal telegraph system, to give copyright to newspapers writers, to prohibit the importation and migration of foreigners and aliens under contract to per form labor in the United States, and that to legalize the incorporation of national trades unions. Then there are the bills affecting the Pacific railroads, a number of pension bills, and numerous other matters of conse quence. The resolution proposing an amend ment to the Constitution, making the Presi dential term six years, is also on the calendar. The House calendar is vastly longer, of course, and fills 79 pages. Among the special orders are the Mexican Pension Bill, which has passed both Houses, and is now held on amendments ; the bills relating to the for feiture of certain land grants to railroads ; the bill concerning the question of the Presi dential count and succession; the bill au thorizing the construction of a new 3,000,000 building for the Congressional Library; the bill to provide for the more speedy delivery of letters at free delivery offices, and to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout rhc United Slates. A bill "for the relief of fruit growers and to encourage the cultivation of fruits," but which carries in it the repeal of the Internal Revenue taxes, is well forward on the calender of tho Committee of the Whole. The Utah bill, which passed e Senate, is on the Speaker's table. The prMte calendar is crowded to overflowing. Send a tico-cent stamp lo The National Trib une for a petition in favor of the immediate passage of the " Avicndments to the Mexican Pension Hill," and do it at once. Time is precious. THE 

DUTY OF CHEERFULNESS. The first duty of every man now is to be cheerfully confident himself and cultivate the same frame of mind in those with whom he comes in contact. There is absolutely no reason for prolonging any farther the present business depression. Apprehensions of a disturbing policy by the parly which was successful in the recent election arc groundless, because, aside from higher and more patriotic reasons, it behooves tho Democratic party to be on its good behavior. It earnestly desires to retain the power to which it has at last attained, after 21 years of defeat, and it is going to leave nothing undone to win the confidence of the people. There are, however, weightier reasons' than any mere partisan consideration for anticipating a sjieedy and decided improve ment in business matters. Tho main fact is that there is an end sometime to every thing. There must an end come to the business stagnation. Factories arc not go ing to rust out in idleness, nor is money going to be hoaided up in vaults ahvays, nor for auy great length of time. Rolling mills and cotton-factories can not afford to lie idle from year to year, any more than the workiugman can afford to stand around Avith his hands in his pockets fiom week to week. Even capital cats itself up unless actively employed. The law of employment is the same for all. The workingman must go to work, the mill wheels must start to turning, the hoarded money in the bank vault must go out and seek investment. They have all held off as long as possible, and the end is at hand. The past year has not been a good season for auy of them. The next must be made good enough to compensate for it. The rotten aud rotting concerns and enterprises have been subjected to strains which have brought them down with a crash, that sounder ones might grow and develop. This they Avill proceed, to do when the new year fairly opens. We ahall then have an era of business activity begin which has not been known since 1879. There is an immensity of capital lying idle, but eager to be invested. Thcro are millions of strong -hearted, clear-headed young men impalientr for their careers There are limitlessrpoasibilities for the cap ital and for the young men. The combina tion of these cannot be much longer delayed. Time is too precious to be longer wasted. 1885 must bring more to everybody than 1834 has. It will be made to do so, and the product will be general 'business prosperity. The lest icork thai any comrade call do is io circulate a petition in favor of the Mexican Tension Bill. This is substantial service for the needy and deserving. THE 

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. Tho message which President Arthur transmitted to Congress upon its assembling last Monday does him .the greatest credit. No more plain, direct, sensible, business-like document ever proceeded from the pen of an American President. It is not brief, how ever, at the expense of lucidity or coherence, for every subject touched upon is treated comprehensively, and in words that convey the writer's exact meaning in the briefest form. The message begins with a graceful allu sion to the long political contest which has just concluded, and congratulates the Ameri can people- that in spite of the fervor and intensity with which the contest was waged the iniblic peace suffered no disturbance, and the people everywhere patiently and quietly awaited the result. " Nothing," says the President, " could more strikingly illus trate the temper of the American citizen, his love of order, and his loyalty to law nothing could more signally demonstrate the strength and wisdom of our political in stitutions." Allusion is made to the neglect of Con gress to provide for a pacific settlement of a disputed election similar to that which occurred eight years ago. Passing to a discussion of our foreign af fairs , he says that the hostilities between France and China embarass our eastern relations somewhat. The Chinese Govern ment has promptly paid the claims of American citizens whose property was de stroyed in recent riots, and he renews his recommendation that the Canton indemnity fund be returned to China. The flag of tho International Association of the Congo was recognized by him as that of a friendly government, but in very careful avoidance of auy prejudice to conflicting territorial claims. Therc-cstablishmenfc of a commercial agency at Cairo is recommended. One of the most important diplomatic acts of the year was the conclusion of a treaty with Nicaragua authorizing the construction by tue United States of a canal, railway and telegraph line across Nicaraguan territory. The contemplated route' proceeds GO miles along tho River San Juan and Lake Nicaragua and leaves for actual canal con struction about 17 miles on the Pacific and 3G miles on tho Atlantic, side. The construc tion of the canal will, give us a coast line such as our commercial interests impera tively demand. Schemes for a revolution in Cuba have J been very trying to our officers whose duty it was to preserve neutrality ; but as a rule the measures taken were successful, and very few expeditions were allowed to depart from our ports. A treaty has been nego tiated with Spain which iiromises rich com mercial results in our trade with the An tilles. The greatest difficulties in a diplo matic way have been with the Sultan of Turkey, who has seemed indisposed to regard in a proper spirit the stipulations and treaties we have heretofore concluded with him. The President recommends that in order to take advantage of the invitations which are continually being extended to tis to par-4 ticipate in expositions in various countries of Europe that the President be empowered to appoint commissioners to such exposi tions without pay, and a speciul sum be placed at the disposal of the Secretar3' of State to pay their reasonable expenses. The question of international copyright should justly obtaiu tho attention of Congress. The neutrality laws are so imperfect in their operation as to call for radical re forms so asto cover allatent acts of hostility committed in our territory against the peace of a friendly nation. Tho statutes already enacted do not meet emergencies that have arisen sinco and which must bo provided for, and acts of hostility which fall short of the equipment of armed vessels or the sail ing of filibustering parties must be reached and punished. The naturalization laws should bo revised so as to do away with some sections which haveonly historical interest and incongruities such as those which favor tho naturalization of men who have served in the Army or in the merchant service, but give no special favors to those who served in the Navy or Marine Corps. The condition of Iho national finances is summed up in the following table: It appear? that the ordinary revenues for tho fiscal year ended June CO, 1831, were From customs From internal revenue..

The recommendation of the Secretary of the Treasury that the one and two dollar notes be relieved from circulation in order to make room for the silver, is heartily indorsed; also, the adoption of some scheme for the redemption of the trade dollar. The recommendation in the message of 1832 of the abolition of all excise duties ex cept those relating to distilled spirits is re newed. In the event of such abolition the revenues that will still remain to the Gov ernment, will, in the President's opinion, "not only suffice to meet its reasonable ex penditures, but will afford a surplus large enough to permit such tariff reduction as may seem to be advisable, when the results of recent revenue laws aud commercial trea ties shall have shown in what quarters those reductions can be most judiciously effected." A commission to devise means for increas ing our foreign trade is recommended as an aid to the solution of one'of the gravest problems which can appeal to the wisdom of Congress, and the President lends his sup port to that part of the Secretary's report which emphatically recognizes that as an incentive to the investment of American capital in American steamships, the Govern ment shall, by liberal payments for mail transportation or otherwise, lend its active assistance to individual enterprise, and de clares his belief that unless that course be pursued our foreign carrying trade must re main, as it is to-day, almost exclusively in the hands of foreigners. The hope is expressed that tho bill which passed the Senate at the last session permit ting banks to issue notes equal to the face value of their deposit bonds will also bo passed by the House of Representatives. The past year has been notable for its en tire freedom from Indian outbreaks. Much urgency characterizes the Presi dents recommendations on the duty of be ginning at once the work of fortifying our seaboard. He would have an expenditure of ?CO,000,000 extended over a period of yeara, with an appropriation of about one tenth of that amount made to begin the work. This, it is expected, will supply the coast with adequate forts and guns of high power, and Congress should at once enable the Government to establish foundries and forges, which will construct guns of a power sufficient to cope with the best made in the world. So far the work of bnilding new cruisers has proceeded satisfactorily, but it cannot be too strongly urged upon Congress that greater efforts be made to restore the Navy to the high state of efficiency that formerly characterized it. Instead of being lulled into fancied security by a long peace, it is plain that considerations of wise economy and just regard for our future tranquility dictate the policy of immediately strength ening this arm of the service. The gratifying fact is mentioned that the loss of revenue in the Post-Office Depart ment from the rale of letter postage has been very much less than was generally an ticipated. The recommendation of the Postmaster-General that the unit of weight in the rate of finr-class matter shall be one ounce instead of half an ounce is indorsed. This would not result in any loss of revenue, and would greatly promote the convenience of the public, and there should also be some means provided whereby exceptional dis patch may be secured for letters by the payment of ahigher late of postage. The President believes that if polygamy can be suppressed by law, it can only be done by the most radical legislation consist ent with the restraints of the Constitution, and he would recommend the absolute polit ical control of the Territory of Utah be placed in the hands of commissioners clothed with the greatest powers that may be justly aud wisely put in their hands. Next to the national finances the most space is given in tho message, and very wisely too, to our commercial policy and the extension of our foreign trade. He states his plans at length, which we shall discuss hereafter. The Nation's relations to Gen. Grant are disposed of in the following paragraph: 1 recommend that, in recognition of the emi nent services of Ulysses S. Grant, late General of the Annies of tho United States and twice President of this Nation, that Congress confer upon him a suitable pension. After some minor recommendations in regard to forestry and other matters the Message concludes as follows : As tho time draws nigh when I am to rotiro from the public service, I cannot refrain from expressing to the members of tho National Legislatures witii whom I liavo been brought into personal and official intercourse nij sin cere appreciation of their unfailing courtesy and of their harmonins co-operation with tho Executive in so many measures calculated to promote the best interests of tho Nation. Aud to my fellow-citizens generally I acknowledge a dcop sense of obligation for tho support which they have accorded mo in my administration of tho Excctitivo Department" of this Govern ment. As wo have said before, we regard this a3 an unusually able State document, with all it3 recommendations judicious and well timed, and stated in fitting language. But one serious blemish mars it. This is the omission of all reference to the important subject of pensious-to soldiers. It is strange how so weighty a matter could have been passed over without any reference whatever. The duty of tho Nation to the surviving defenders of the Union, and to the widows and orphans of those who fell during the conflict or have passed away since, is cer tainly, and in whatever light it may be viewed, as worthy of extended discussion iu a Presidential Message as any other subject treated there. That all allusion to pensions is confined to a recommendation of an allow ance to a gentleman who has already been generously treated by our people is the least creditable feature of tho Message. A 

GRAND SPECTACLE. There is nothing in the history of man grander than the spectacle which the Ameri can people have just furnished the world. After a struggle of bitter intensity, in which the victory was decided by a difference of but a few hundred votes, we have seen an instantaneous acquiescence in the result, and the party which has held the power iu this couutry for 24 years quietly prepare to step down and out. It is practically a revo lution, for certainly the change that follows the fact of Mr. Cleveland getting several hundred more votes in New York than Mr. Blaine i3 greater than follows a revolution with collisions of armed men in other coun tries. The change in the personnel of the Government is greater than that which was resisted with bloody war when the Repub lican party came into power 24 years ago. Now there is neither violence nor thought of violence. All that the dominant party required to know was that there was a legal majority no matter how small of the votes cast against it, and it at ouce acqui esced in the surrender of the enormous power centered in its hands into that of its opponents. This is a spectacle which must strengthen the cause of free government all over the world. The exhibition of self-ccntrol, of ready submission to the law, and of cheer ful acquiescence in the will of the majority is one to make every American proud of his glorious country, and give renewed vindica tion to the world of the strength and per manency of a government of the people, for the people and by the people. TILE BUSINESS WORLD. Attentive watchers of the business horizon during the week saw several unmistakable streaks that heralded the coming dawn. Principal among these were incidents show ing a revival of operations in iron and steel making. This interest always leads the way out of any depression, and the " blow-ing-in " of several important furnaces, foun dries and factories is accepted as trustworthy harbingers of the in-coming of better times. There was a slight but noticeable im provement in other branches of trade. Cot ton goods revived somewhat, and woolen goods showed more animation than could be wholly attributed to the setting-in of cold weather. During the early part of last week specu lation on the stock market was dull and somewhat irregular. Later on the market greatly improved and prices advanced sharply. This is generally accepted as the indication of a healthier business feeling and a number of leading bears are reported to have changed their views and placed themselves on the other side of the market. "Wheat opened actively in Chicago this week at 74$ ; Corn was in fair demand at 3Si; Oats were weak at 25 J; Rye quiet at 61, and Barley dull at 50. Pork sold readily at 10.90 and $H per hundred. THE PETITIONS. The pension jieti tions arealready beginning to be returned to The National Tkibune, aud there is great gratification to be found in considering the number and class of signa tures appended to each. Simply everybody is signing them Democrats, Republicans, Prohibitionists and Germans, Greenbackers and "Gold Bugs," Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Gentiles and the ,: heathen of the isles." Judges, lawyers, merchants and me chanics all are anxious that the Govern ment shall deal righteously with the men who gave it everything, and preserved its life at the co3t of their own health and strength. "We hope within the next few weeks to get in 20,000 of these signed by a million names. Then the passage of the Mexican Pension Bill will be assured be yond a doubt, and the relief of tens of thousands of our comrades begin at once. LOOK OUT. Subscribers are earnestly requested to look at the number on the yellow slip of their paper, and compare it with the number in the date line, to see how near their sub scriptions are to expiring. In this way they can always tell how their accounts stand. For instance, this week's paper is numbered 173, and consequently all subscriptions bear ing that number expire this week. Next week Dec. 11 No. 174 will expire. The week following Dec. 18 No. 175 will be out. All nnmbered 176 will expire Dec. 25, and those numbered 177 Jan. 1. By looking after these in time subscribers will avoid . HE FIXED THINGS. Mr. and Mrs. Younglove, who were on their wedding tour, and extremely "spoony," found that they attracted a great deal of attention whenever they appeared at table in the hotel. Mr. Young love, who prides himself on his shrewd management, told his darling he would save her this annoyance. Poking a dollar into the receptive hand of the head-waiter, he explained their trotiblo, and asked him to circulate among tho guests the information that the couple were not in their honeymoon, but had been long married. But at their next appearance at tablo Mr. and Jin. Younglove were stared at worse than ever. The head-waiter was called. He came with a self-satisfied grin on his face. ..
