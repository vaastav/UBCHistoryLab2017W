The annual message of Roosevelt was read today ia both houses of congress. Practical 1 no business was attempted by either body beyond listening to the message. The galleries of both the senate and the house were crowded at the begin ning but as the reading progressed the attendance diminished somewhat. The senators and members were supplied with printed copies and many followed the reading clerks with scrupulous care. The reading consumed two hours and fifteen minutes in each house. In the senate so far, no bill has been introduced but there is scarcely a sen ator' whose desk is not well covered with documents. It is probable that the flood will "break out tomorrow. Speaker Cannon treated the house to a surprise in announcing the member ship of the committee on bankingyitnd currency. This advance information regarding the committee led to the conclusion that it is his Intention to presa financial legislation, but those who are close to the speaker say his only purpose is to afford a depository for petitions and letters bearing upon the currency question. The member ship of the committee is increased by an addtUon of one democrat making seven members of that party on It in stead of six as during the last congress. This is in accordance with the re quest of Minority Leader Williams but it is expected that it is not to be taken a9 an indication that the rule be com plied with in the other committees. Both the senate and the house ad journed almost immediately after the conclusion of the message. The house adjourned to Thursday when it is prob able it will again adjourn for the week.

Dec. 3. After having met on 100 separate days in which 115 sessions were held and having returned 441 indictments involving 47 persons, the Oliver grand jury, the most noted in the city's history, made its f'.nal re port to Superior Judge Coffey this ev ening and was discharged from further service by the court. In all 597 wit nesses were brought before the jury during the time between the first as sembling on November 9th, 1906 and the final adjournment today. Most of the work has been concerned with in dictments for graft and bribery con nected with municipal affairs and the public utility corporations of San Francisco. The final report is a vol uminous document and says In part: "To summarize completely the work undertaken and the matters investi gated by the grand jury would swell this report out of all reasonable pro portions, we cannot even outline the vast amount of evidence received, showing corruption and vice of the lowest kind, involving -the 'greatest moral turpitude, such as the participa tion of the former mayor of the city in profits earned by prostitution of the lowest of fallen women and which con stitutes recital of seemingly Inconceiv able sin. shame and violation of the law.

The president today transmitted the following me page to the senate and the house of representative: "No nation has greater resources than ours, and 1 think It can truthfully said that every citizen ' of no nation possess greater energy and industrial ability.

"In my message to the congress on December 5. 19u5, I said: "If the folly of man mars the general well being, then those who are Innocent of the folly will have to pay the :art of the penalty incurred by those who are guilty of the folly. A panic brought on ty the speculative folly of part of the business community would hurt the whole business community: but such stoppage of welfare, though it might be severe, would not be lasting. In the ) long run, tile one vital factor in the i permanent prosperity of the country is i the high individual character of the average American worker, the average American citizen, no matter whether his work be mental or manual, wheth- er he be farmer or wage worker, busl- ness man or professional man.

But each should be sharply checked where it acts against law and justice. -j-ne rnakers of our na tional constitution provided especial ly that the regulation of interstate commerce should come within the sphere of tho general government. The arguments In favor of their taking this stand were even then overwhelming. But they are fur stronger today, in view of the enormous development of great business agencies, usually corpor ate in form. Experience has shown conclusively that it is useless to try to get any adequate regulation and super vision of these great corporations by state action. Such' regulation and su pervision can only be effectively exer cised by a sovereign whose Jurisdiction is co-extensive with the field of work of the corporations that is, by the na tional government. I believe that this regulation and supervision can be ob tained by the enactment of law by the congress. our steady aim should be by legislation, cautiously and carefully undertaken, but resolutely persevered in, to assert the sovereign ty of the national government by af firmative action. " This !s only In form an innovation. In substance it is merely a restoration; for from the earliest time such regula tion of industrial activities has been recognized in the action of the law making bodies: and all that I propose Is to meet the changed condition la such manner as will prevent the com monwealth abdicating the power It has always possessed, not only in this country, but also in England before and since this country became a sep arate nation. " "It has been a misfortune that the national laws on this subject have hitherto been of a negative or prohib itive rather than an affirmative kind, and still more that they have In part sought to prohibit what could not b? effectively prohibited, and have in part in their prohibitions confounded what should be allowed and what should not be allowed. It Is generally useless to try to prohibit all restraint on competition, whetHer this restraint be reasonable or -unreasonable; and where it is not useless it Is generally hurtful. The successful pros ecution of one device to evade the law immediately develops another device to accomplish the same purpose. What Is needl is not sweeping prohibition of every arrangement, good or bad, which may tend to restrict competition but such adequate supervision and reg ulation as will nrevent any restriction of competition from being to the det I riment of the public, as well as such supervision and regulation as will pre vent other abuses in no way connected with restriction or competition.' . "I have called your attention In these quotations to what I have already said because I am satisfied that It is the duty of the national government to embody In action the principles thus expressed.

AOKI It is No Sign of III feeling Toward Us Going Back to Tell ilout Immigration and Other Things. Washington, Dec. 3. Viscount Aokl talked briefly and reservedly today re garding the instructions given him by his government to return home for die purpose of making a report on affairs in wnich Japan Is Interested . Jointly with the United States. The ambassa dor cordially received a representative of the Associated Press and appeared in a cheerful mood. "I am going home," he said, "for the purpose of making a verbal report to my government. There are many things to report on. things I have heard and seen in this country. The report can be made better verbally than in writing. There Is no other significance to my visit. I shall discuss Immigra tion la addition to other questions in which my government is interested. My return cannot be construed in any way as an Indication of unfriendliness on the part of Japan for the United States. The American government knows very well that Japan Is dis posed to be one of its best friends. Any other suggestion would be foolish to entertain. The immigration ques tion Is not at all a serious one and in my Judgment will be settled satisfac torily. My return, I repeat, has no bearing on the relations between the United States and Japan. Our rela tions are friendly and I hope will re main so. There is no reason why they should be otherwise, but on the con trary, every reason why they should continue good."

If time permits, w?i look into the general question -of Japanese im migration on the Pacific coast before he sails for home. He intended doing this earlier in the year but the trip was for a time, abandoned. At the stale department it was learned tha Aoki did not present letters of recall but hat-what re -received was a summons to come home for consultation with the government. . It is not known1 at the department whether Aoki would return to the United States. The Impression was that the ambassador himself was not aware of his future movements. Aoki received word on Saturday that his government wanted him to come home and he lost no time In acquainting the state department with that fa. The most positive statement is made at the Japanese embassy that Aoki's recall was not the result of any dissatisfac tion with his course on the part of his government or that it in any way dis avows his actions while here.
