The proposition with which we have to deal is the reduction of the revenue received by the Oovornment and indirectly paid by the people from customs duties. The question of free trade is not involved, nor is there now any occasion for a general dis cussion of the wisdom or expediency of a protective system. Justice and fairness dictate that in any modifica tion of our present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interests which have been encouraged by Buch laws, and in which our citizens have largo investments, should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. We should also deal with the subject in such manner as to protect the inter ests of American labor, which is , the capital of our workingmen ; its sta bility and proper remuneration fur nish the most justifiable pretext for a protective policy.' . Within these limi tations a certain reduction should be made in the customs revenue. The amount of such reduction having been determined, the inquiry follows? Where can it best be remitted, and what articles can best be released from duty, in the interest of our citizens? I think the reduction should be made in the revenue derived from a tax upon the imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen the cost of living in every family of the land, and release to the people in every humble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal industry THE 

NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM. During the year ended Nov. 1, 1885, 145 national banks were organized with an aggregate capital of $16,938,- 000, and circulating notes have been issued to them amounting to $4,274,- 710. The whole number of these banks in existence cn the day above mentioned was 2,72j The very lim ited amount of circulating notes issued by our national banks, compared with the amount the law permits them to issue upon a deposit of bonds for their redemption, indicates that the volume of our circulating medium may be largely increase by their in struinetality. THE8ILVEK COINAGE. Nothing more important than the present condition of the currency and coinage can claim your attention Since February, 1878, the Govern nient has, , under the compulsory provisions of law, purchased .silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more than $2,000,000 every month. Iiy this process, up to the present date, 21.",7f9,4;n silver dollars have been coined, a reasonable ap preciation of a delegation of power to the General Government would limit its exercise without express re strictive words to the people's needs and the requirements of the public welfare. Upon this theory, the au thority to "coin money" given to Congress by the Constitution permits the purchase by the Government of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such purchase and coinage to an extent beyond the amount needed for a sufficient" circulating medium. The desire to . utilize the silver product of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to the silver currency, of the nation as is compelled by the silver coinage act is negatived by the fact, that, up to the present time, only about 50,000,000 of the silver dollars so coinwl have actually found their way into circulation, leaving more than $16"),000,otio in possession of the Government. Every month $2,000,000 of gold in the public treas- ury are paid out lor two millions or more of silver dollars to be added to the idle mass already accumulated. If continued long enough this opera tion will result in the substitution of silver for all the gold the Government owns applicable to its general pur poses, it will not uo to rely upon the customs receipts of the Govern The" first message from a l)cmo- ment to make good this drain of gold, yratic President in a quarter of a cen- because the silver coined having been fury went to congress last Tuesday, made legal tender for all debts and It is clear, full and explicit upon all. dues public and private at times dur itoints. -..We give below, in full, that ing the last six months 58 per cent. portion of the message bearing uion of the receipts for duties have been Font attempts have been made re cently to burn the blind asylum at Nashville, and thrw attempts to fire the colored orphan asylum at Chatta nooga, all of which have fortunately proved unsuccessful. We learn from a corresjiomlence in the Chattanooga Times that the Day ton Gazette has "scooped" the Pike ville Advance. The Advance was a bright, sprightly little paper, and its demise is not flattering to the enter prise of Bledsoe county. The Dayton Gazette, in a chapter on marriage, says that blissful proln lem of life "used to be the chief end of man." What kind of a Sunday- school does the Gazette man go to ? The old Westminster catechism teaches us that "man's chief end is to Cleveland Banner : Not many men who have been in Congress as long as was Gen. Dibrell can truthfully say as he said in a temperance speech at Sparta last week, "that in all his ten years in Congress, which is such a great temptation to most men, he never drank a drop of intoxicating liquors and never visited a drinking saloon." gold, and the coins will part com pany. Gold, still the standard of values necessary in our dealings with other counties, will be at a premium over silver. The banks, which have substituted gold for the deposits of their customers, may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsone profit. Rich speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neighbors who need it to liquidate their debts at a ruinous premium over silver, and the labor ing men and women of the land, the most defenseless of all, will find that the dollar received for the wage of their toil has sadly shrunk in its pur chasing power. It may be said that the result will be but temporary, and that ultimately the price of labor will bo adjusted to the change; but even if this takes place, the wage worker cannot possi bly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price he is compelled to pay for his living will not only be meas ured in a coin heavily depreciated, and fluctuating and uncertain in its value, but this uncertainly in the value of the purchasing medium will be made the pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by the actual depreciation. The words uttered in 1834 by Daniel Webster, in the Senate of the United States, are true today: "The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound currency and who Buffersmost by mischievous legislation in money matters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil." The most distinguished advocate of bimetallism, discussing our silver coinage, has lately written: "No American citizen's hand has yet ielt the sensation of cheapness, either in receiving or expending the Silver Act dollars." Ana those who live by labor . or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheapness. However plenty silver dollars may become, they will not be distributed as gifts among the people, and if the laboring man should receive four depreciated dollars where he now receives but two, he will pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pays for all the necessaries and comforts of life. Those who do not fear any disastrous consequences aris' ing from the continued compulsory coinage of silver, as now directed? by law, and who suppose that the addi tion to the currency of the country, intended as its results, will be a public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates that the point is easily reached in the attempt to float at the same time two sorts of money of different excellence,' when the better will cease to be in circulation. The An acknowledgment of this fact is found in the act by virtue of which our silver is compulsorily coined. It provides that the President shall invite the Governments of the coun tries composing the luin union, so called, and of such other' European nations, as he may deem advisable, to join the United States in a confer ence to adopt a common ratio between gold and silver, for the purpose of establishing internationally the use of bi-metallie money securities fixity of relative value between these metals. This conference absolutely failed and a similar fate has awaited all subsequent efforts in the same direc tion, and still' we continue our coinage of silver at a ratio different from that of any other nation. The most vital part of the silver coinage act remains inoperative and unexecuted and without an ally or friend. We battle upon the silver field in an illogical and losing contest. To give full effect to the design of Congress on this sub ject I have made a careful and earn est endeavor since the adjournment of the last Congress. To this end I delegated a gentleman well instructed in fiscal science to proceed to the financial centers of Europe and in conjunction with our Ministers to England, France and Germany,' to obtain a full knowledge of the atti tude and intent of these governments in respect to the establishment of such an internatiodal ratio as wauld procure the free coinage of both met als at the mints of those countries and our own. By my direction, our Con sul General at Paris has given close attention to the proceedings of the congress of the Iiatin Union, in order to indicate our interest in its objects and report its action. It may be said as the result of these efforts, that the attitude of the lead ing Powers remains i substantially unchanged since the monetary con ference of 1S.K1 ; nor is it to ho quesr tioned that the views of these govern ments are in each instance supported by the weight of public opinion. The steps thus taken have, therefore, only more fully demonstrated the useless ness of further attempts at present to arrive at any agreement on the sub ject with other nations. In the mean time we are accumulating silver coin based on our own peculiar ratio to such an extent and assuming so heavy a burden to be provided lor m any international negotiation, as will ren der us an undesirable party to any future monetary conference of na tions. . It is a significant fact that four of live countries composing the Latin union mentioned in our coinage act, embarrassed with their silver, have just completed an agreement among pended they can be readily obtained by all who desire them. If the need of more is at any time apparent, their coinage may be renewed. That disaster has not already over taken us furnishes no proof that dan ger does not wait upon a continuation of the present silver coinage. We have been savwl by the most careful management and the most unusual expedients ; by a combination of for tunate conditions and by a confident expectation that Ihe course of the government in regard to silver coin age would be speedily changed by the action of Congress. Prosperity hesitates on our threshold because of dangers and uncertainties surround ing this question. Capital'- timidly shrinks from trade, and investors are unwilling to take the, chanco of the questionable shape in which their money will be returned to them, whileenterprise halts at a risk against which care and sagacious manage ment do not protect. ' As a necessary consequence, labor lacks employment, and suffering and distress are v'sited upon a portion of our fellow-citizens especially entitled to the careful .con sideration of those charged with the duty of legislation. No interest ap peals to us so strongly for a safe and stable currency as the vast army of the unemployed. I recommend the suspension of the compulsory coinage of silver dollars, directed by the law passed in February, 1878. Wm. II.

PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. hoarding of gold, which has already taken place, indicates that we shall not escape the same experience in such cases. If this silver coinage be continued we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon the field of circulation to silver alone. This, of course, must produce a severe contraction of our circulating medium iastead of adding to it. It will not be disputed, that any attempt on the part of the Government to cause the circulation of silver . dollars, worth' eighty cents, side by side with gold dollars worth one hundred cents, even with the limit that legislation does not run counter to the laws of trade, to be successful must be seconded by the confidence of the people that both ON

Till- themselves that no more silver shall be coined by their respective govern ments, and that such as has been al ready coined and in circulation shall be redeemed in gold by the country of its coinage.

The condition in Which our treasury may be placed by a per sistence in our t present course, is a matter of concern to every patriotic citizen who docs not desire his gov ernment to pay in silver such of its obligations as should be paid in gold ; nor should our condition be such as coins will retain the same purchasing to oblige us in a prudent manage- power, and. be -interchangeable at will.

REDUCTION DEMANDED. The fact that our revenues are in excess of the actual needs of an econo mical administration of Government, justifies a reduction in the amount exacted from the people for Itt sup- iort. Our Government is but the means established by the will of a free people by which certain princi ples are applied, which thev have iidopttxl fur their Itenetit and protec tion; and it is never better administer ed, and its true spirit is never better observed than w h n the . people's taxation AriNup)oit h scrupulously limitod Jiit' actual ueritv of in silver or silver certificates while the average within that period has been 20 per cent. The portion of silver and its certificates received by the Government will probably increase as time goes on for the reason that the nearer the period approaches when it will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obligations the greater inducement there will be to hoard gold against depreciation in the value of silver, or for the puriose of secu lating. This hoarding of gold has already, lx-gun.

There is certainly not enough silver now in circulation to cause uneasiness, and the whole amount coined and now on hand might after a time be absorbed by the people without apprehension, but it is the ceaseless stream that threatens to overflow the land which causes fear and uncertainly. What has been thus far submitted on this subject relates almost entirely to considerations of a home nature unconnected with the bearing which the iwlicies of other nations have on the question, but It is ierfectly ap parent that a line of action in regard to our currency cannot widely be set tied on or persisted in without con sidering the attitude on the subject of other countries with whom we main tain ))terrinie tnroiign commerce. trade jMid travel.

Nor should it be forgotten it is not the rich nor the money lender alone that must submit to such a readjustment enforced by the government and their debtors. The pittance of the widow and the orphan and the incomes of helpless beneficiaries of all kinds would be disastrously reduced. The depositors in savings banks and other institutions which hold in trust the savings of the poor, when their little accumulations are, scaled down to meet the new order of things, would in their distress painfully realize the delusion of the promise made; to them that plentiful money would im prove their condition.
