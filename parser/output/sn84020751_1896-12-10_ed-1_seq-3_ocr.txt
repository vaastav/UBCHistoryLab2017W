WEYLER HEMMED IN. If He Starts to Havana by Rail an Attempt Will be Made to Capture Him. Key West, December 7. The steamer Whitney brought Havana news this morning in relation to Maceo and Weyler. Passengers state that Wevler is now en camped ten miles from Arternisa, and his army is scattered along the Trocha and through the Pinar del Rio district. When Maceo re treated from Wevler, in his first campaign his plan was to sur prise Weyler at his first oppor tunity and now Maceo has his army on either side of Weyler, and they ar having daily skirm ishes. Weyler is completely hemmed in and if he shall attempt to move he will be compelled to go to Arternisa. Small bands have crossed the Trocha into Havana district, and are attacking the outposts and villages of that province. Insurgents numbering 7,000 are encamped in Havana province, twenty miles from Havana, and will go to Maceo's assistance when needed. Spies in Havana are keeping the insurgents posted as to the movements of the Span ish troops. A movement is on foot to capture Weyler if he shall attempt to go to Havana by rail. Firemen and volunteers in Ha vana are being sent to Weyler' s relief. Heretofore these troops were used in defense of the city. Madrid, Dec. 7. A report reaches here from Havana that Maceo has gone to New York to consult with the Cuban revolu tionary committee there. Pikeville Letter.

A few applications of Salvation Oil will readily cure sprains and bruises, and heal cuts, burns and scalds. . It is undoubtedly the best pain-cure on the market, and should be, ready for use, in, every home in the land. Mr. Frank Stubenhaver 1337 Elm St., Dubuque, Iowa, states : "I used Salvation Oil on a sprained elbow, which threatened to prevent me from working, and after several thorough rubbings, I awoke the very next morning much relieved and able to go to work. Had I not used Salvation Oil I certainly would have lost a week's work, which would have amounted to many times the cost of a bottle of Oil. Everybody should keep Salvation Oil in the house." It is sold everywhere for only 25 cents. CUBA'S NEXT DOSE. Greenville Weekly-- Died, at the. heme of tis mother in this place last Saturday, Herbert A. Koundtree.

Denial has followed close upon tho statement published bp the Daily News that the powers would shortly consider a proiect, tueoDiect ot wmcn is the occupation by Russia of the northeastern corner of Turkey, formed by the Bosphorous and the Black Sea to about half way down the Bosphorus, which together with the Dardanelles, will be made entirely free to the vessels of all nations. The Daily News added that the forts along the Dardenelles, will be made entirely free to the vessels of all nations. The Daily News added that the forts along the Dardenelles would be dismantled and Abdul Hamid would retire from the Sultanate. In official quarters here it is de clared that the alleged project is an absurd fantasy. The foreign office has heard or no such pro posal and officials there say it is impossible to understand why a responsible paper should publish such a statement. . Jthe truth is that there is such a complete pause in the discussion of the question, affecting the Darda nelles. When the matter is re opened Lord Salisbury will not admit of auy change in his con tention that whatever rights in the straits have been obtained by Russia may be extended to all the powers.- As it a DricK were lying in my stomach", is the description by a dys peptic of his feeling after eating. .This is one" of tho commonest symp toms of indigestion.

The- Span iards here say that General Wey ler intends to issue a decree or dering every able bodied man from 18 years to 60 to enlist, in the army and take the field against the insurgents. This news has created such an excitement among Cuban families that the number of young men wh have ioined the insurgent forces within the . past few days is greater that at any time since the beginning of the war. A circular has been quietly issued to the Cubans which says: "No man of honor can doubt which side he must take if placed by the tyranny of. the Spanish government in the position of choosing between Spain and Cuban Libre." El Pueblo says: ' 'General Wey ler' r duty is to issue that decree. We ought to know here who is a Spaniard and who is a conspira tor. Havana is full of Spain s enemies masquerading under the who is friend and who is enemy. Masks off !" But the real motive of Weyler, with regard to this decree has not been mentioned above. It is a fact that the 18,000 insurgents re cently sent bo Spain are not en ough to cover all the losses of the Spanish army within the past few weeks . More than that, it is said that high military authorities here are concealing from Spain the knowledge of more than half of the army's losses for the pur pose of continuing to draw from the Treasury the wages and al lowances of the dead men. It is estimated that from April 1895, to last November more than $30, 000,000 have been stolen from the Spanish treasury in this way. llie number of soldiers in the field is less than the central gov ernment believes and is not suffi cient for Weyler' s plan of cam paign, which is similar to march against the insurgents in heavy bodies. The nearer the date of Presi den Cleveland's message an- proaches the greater grows the excitement among Spaniards. The talk of war in the L nited States is renewed. The Diario de la Marina and La Lucha try to con vince the Spanish that it is aiore likely to be detrimental to the Cubans than helpful to them, but these assurances are of no avail. What makes the Spanish resi dents more desperate . is the fi nancial distress of the country which is ruining them. They all believe that a war with the United States would afford a happy salu tation. In the ignorance of the real power of the United States, that Spain would after Uncle Sam was beaten he would have to pay a heavy indemnity to Spain. Uutside of Havana a famine is ginning tto spread. In Brain- ates, province of Pinar del Rio, more than 10,000 persons are dy ing from hunger. In Cardenas poverty is so great that families who were wealthy before the war are now begging in the streets . In Clenf uegos, an opulent city until 1895, the misery is also great, and here in Havana famine is expected soon as a consequence of Weyler' s methods of warfare and his destruction of all the pro visions in the rural country dis tricts.

Comment ing upon President Cleveland's message to Congress, the Stand ard will to-morrow say, it is dig hined and able and is marked throughout with sterling common sense. It deserves and will doubtless obtain the serious study of the European people. The Standard is of the opinion that the message will excite bit terness in Spain, which country, nevsrthcless must make up her mind to listen to friendly counsel. Spaniards may be excused if they detect a tone of menace The con ditions of Cuba will certainly not induce impartial observers to say that menace is unwarranted. The paper dwells on Mr. Cleve land's pointed reassertion of the Monroe doctrine in the paragraph reading: . "Whatever circumstances may arise our policy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or any interference with its control by any other power." . It sees in this the intention of the United States to claim a vir tual protectorate over the Ameri can continent and the islands thereof. This, it adds, is a large and bold policy that is not quite free from danger, as Spain is not the only power with which the United States might thereby be come embroiled. The paper expresses the opinion that if Spain found a powerful friend in Europe to help prevent Cuba from passing from her hands, the o iections of the United States based on the Monroe doc- trine.would not be of much ac count. Fortunately there seems to be no real risk that the Monroe doctrine will occasion further dis-i putes with Great Britain. The Daily News is chiefly im pressed by the section of the mes sage referring to Cuba . It ad mits that the Americans cannot be permanently indifferent to the disastrous. condition of the island, but says that while the intentions of President Cleveland and Secre tary of State Olney may be in every tvay good, oui opiniom is favorable to the latest version of the Monroe doctrine and Spain will have some influential support if she" holds out against it.

It is often difficult to convince pec pie their blood is impure, until dread lul carbunclee, aosoesses, boils, scrot ula or salt rheum, are painful proof ot the fact.
