I,'ivett, slo 80; Whittier, Fuller * Co., $-5 50. The present incumbents— Caroline G. Hancock and Lauren W. Kiply — were unanimously re-elected Librarians for the ensuing year. The matter ol" a new rail opposite the hook-shelves, to prevent the too common theft of books, was referred to Mr. Fitch, with power to act. After ordering 85 books purchased — which will be on the shelves Saturday — the Hoard adjourned. The Illegality of the Election. There seems to he no substantial division of opinion concerning the legality of the election — it is conceded generally, that it was not a legal election. The general opinion is that the old school otlicers will hold over, as they are elected to ho.d " un til their successors are elected and quali fied.'' The law requires ttiat the election for school officers he held "on the first Monday in December, I**;;, and on the same day of each two years thereafter." A decision of the Supreme Court will he found cited in the editorial columns, in which it is held that a notice prescribing different hours for an election from those specified by the general election law, is illegal, and that if tlie polls are in fact open for a less time than the general law requires, there is no election upon which proceedings can be based. There is much difference of opinion expressed as to whether the failure of the election does not create vacancies in office, and if so, whether under the pro visions of the Political Code, the Governor cannot appoint a Superintendent of Schools. But this is mainly conjecture, and there does not yet appear to be any positively settled opinion that the matter will reach ths Governor. Street Matters. The county road leading from the city limits to the bridge over the American river is nicely graveled and shaded, and when the dust is settled is a tine drive. It is shaded on both sides by tall trees, and is nicely rounded so thai the surplus water runs off rapidly. On this account travel is very easy and convenient over this road the entire year, and the road-bed does not show the ell'ects of the heavy travel that it is subjected to, so well has the work been done. This road and Twelfth street is traveled more than any other approach to the city. But Twelfth street from H street i<i A street is not graveled, and after a light rain is cut up so l>y teams that it is almost impassable at times. The Supervisors have under construction a line bridge, aiid they want a road leading thereto that can stand heavy travel all the year round. Should Twelfth street not be improved, it is under stood that the property owners on Six teenth will gravel their street to X, and the Supervisors will then construct an approach from the bridge to the city line at Sixteenth street. It will be comparatively an inex pensive matter to gravel either street, as the gravel tan be hauled on the cars, and but few teams will be needed to scatter it. It remains to see which street captures the prize. Clunie Opera House. Achmed AH Bey had a good house last night. His Oriental magic mystifies more and more. Nothing we haw had here has been so well done. It is all mechanical illusion, but so cunningly devised and ad mirably and gracefully executed that it de lies detection. Nothing is more wonderful than the "flashing" of the articles he de sires into sight. Boxes, bells, busts, bun dles and glasses "flash" into sight upon tables and on the floor where before nothing stood, and taken up, and prove to be real. Albert Linton repeated his feat of painting in a few minutes a landscape in oil, ana with his canvas up side down. The Harvey Brothers were ap plauded to the echo, and recalled again and again. They are entirely new in their mirth-provoking mid musical feats and capital actors. Wash Norton, the veteran "change arti>t," repeated his feat of appear ing in seven characters with widely differ ing ' attunes, without leaving the small spot he occupied near the footlights. The present given to seat-holders last night was a watch, and was won by No. 221. held by 7. G. Thompson, 1524 M street The third entertainment of the engagement will be given to-night, and the present to be awarded will be a silk dress pattern, now on exhibition in the window of an up town store. .-»■— ,y A Free Hospital. — The very lauadb'.e scheme has been started to establish a free hospital in Sacramento. The hospital is to be known as St. Luke's, and will be con- Deoted with the Episcopal Church. Further than this, there will be no sectarian in lluence, the objects being purely charitable. The institution will be started in a modest way and will be increased in capacity as its utility and necessity become apparent. The details are not yet announced, but those who may feel interested in the subject can obtain further information from Mrs. C. W. Clark, Mrs. A. 1.. Fove, Miss Lucy J. Hiukson and A. A. Van Voorhies.

Van Arman, agent of the Southern Pacific Company at Chicago, ar rived from the East yesterday, and went to Oroville in connection with colony matters last evening. He states that* good work can be done in Chicago in the line of in ducing immigration to this part of the State by making an exhibition of our pro ducts in the various railroad oflices in that city. He says als* that he has perfected arrangements with several of the roads to put such displays on exhibition in the most piominent places in Chicago, if the materials are furnished, and that the only expense will be in sending the products to the immigration office in Sacramento, properly labeled, in order that the loca tions from which they came may be prop erly credited. The exhibit which was sent to Lansing, Mich., is now in Chicago and is attracting much attention, and is doing a vast amount of good. People in the Eastern States are now beginning to learn that the central and upper portions of the State are equal to, if not superior in production to the ex treme southern portion, especially for men of moderate means, for exhibit of our pro ducts is an object lesson brought directly to their notice, and is actual proof of our ex cellent climate and productive soil. Several colony organizations are in pro cess of organization in Chicago, and only need proper direction to induce them to set tle in, or adjacent to, the Sacramento valley. Mr. Van Annan says that he found in ' 'hieago a colon} 1 organization, formed originally to go to the peninsula of Lower California. The Committee of Examina tion had visited that region and pronounced it wholly unfit for their needs, and he had, by showing them the exhibit from Central and Northern California induced them to send their Examining Committee here, and it wili visit us witbiu a week. Its members are men who are in earnest about remov ing from the rigorous winters of Illinois to the balmy climate of California, and are only a few in comparison to those who are contemplating a permanent location here. Mr. Van Arman further says that enough people throughout the great Northwestern and Middle States are determined to come to California to till the entire Sacramento valley, and the work to be done now is to direct them here. Mr. Van Arman strongly recommends that an exhibit be maintained at the Sacra mento depot, and instanced the fact that at least two carloads of people remain an hour and a half at the station every day, who ought to be convinced by occular proof of the fruitfulness of the soil and the climatic advantages of this part of Califor nia. Board of Supervisors. The Board met in regular session yester day morning, all the members present. N. D. Hack, Road Overseer of District No. 12, filed his quarterly report. Referred to Committee on Roads and Bridge. Demand 4,134 of F. M. Stratton, for $15, held over from the last meeting to be prop erly itemized was, under the suspension of the rules, read, approved and passed. The Committee on Public Buildings were authorized to purchase stoves for the Supervisors' room and the office of the Court Reporter. On motion of Supervisor Ross the Com mittee on Koads and Bridges were ordered to repair the road near Peters' old ferry on the Sacramento river. The demand of John McComber for $H> 70 was, under sus pension of the rales, passed and ordered paid. On motion of McMullen E. E. Barry was allowed to withdraw his demand against the county for $400. Mr. McMulleu offered the following, which was read and placed on tile : Mr. <.'haimtan and G&itlnHrn of the Board: By request Ol Mr. Boss, aud on his behalf, I desire to return to you and our esteemed Clerk the sin cere thanks of Hi. Boas and his family for your assistance and kind consideration in attendance at the funeral of his wife. Also, for the hand some iloral piece you contributed. The Board then adjourned until this morning, to allow them time to examine the foundations of the new bridge across the American river at Twelfth street. They also examined the county bridge across the old mouth of the river. This bridge was removed by the railroad company for the dredger. National Kducation Association. State Superintendent lloitt sent the fol lowing telegram to the Massachusetts Teachers' Association November 25th, then in session at Boston: "California sends greeting to the Massachusetts Teachers' Association, and invites every member to attend the meeting of the National Educa tional Association in San Francisco next July." An immediate reply came, saying: "Massachusetts Teachers' Association sends greeting. Await letter. 1 ' The following letter was received yesterday: Ji'ni. Ira g. Jioit!, Sacramento, OaZ.— Dear Mb. Horn. Your telegram hit us just rifjln. It was enthusiastically received. The Massachusetts Tenches' Association sends greeting through you to fellow teachers in California. Hanj members will undoubtedly accept your cordial invitation In K-half of the National Educa tional Association to attend Its meeting lnißan Francisco next July. All unite in wishing you unbounded success. Fi:ank A. HILL, President. c. \v. J'akmintei:, Secretary. Musical Kvent. — At the Clunie Opera House, Friday, Saturday and Sunday next, and at a Saturday matinee, will appear the Rosener famous Austrian-Hungarian Or chestra. It is announced as "the greatest and only sensational and spectacular musical novelty of Europe." The orchestra has been playing 120 nights at a popular theatre in San Francisco, the Orpheon. It is a very large company of musicians, each one being an instrumental soloist. Sacra mentans who have heard the troupe in San Francisco speak of it in the warmest terms, and as a strong combination of accom plished musicians. Accompanying the troupe is Signor Carlo, who is famous as a rapid painter. In presence of the audience he paints a landscape in oil, 34x40 inches, in a very few minutes. The admission to be charged is 75, r>o and 25 cents, and the box office opens to-morrow. A Point ok Law. — At the close of the piaintilT's testimony in the case of K. .1 DePoe vs. W. P. Coleman. and I-". M. Stein meyers, Mr. Anderson, counsel for the de fense, raised a new and novel proposition on a motion to nonsuit the plaintill — that the alleged damages accruing to plaintiff's property could not be recovered from tho defendants; that under .Sections 22 and 23 of the Vroomau Act, relating to grading and improving public streets, makes the responsibility fall upon the city authorities, and that no personal liability can be fastened upon the contractors or employes or owners of the property adjacent to the alleged accident. Theiiuestiou wa? argued at length, and while the Court held that there was much merit in the counsel's point, under the circumstances ot the case he overruled the motion and allowed the case to go to the jury. A Mathematical Proijlem. — It is a mat ter of fact that the tax proposition on Mon day was defeated, but by how many is a matter of considerable controversy. The law says: 'Should two-thirds of all the votes cast or polled be in favor of the pro position named by the Board it carries, etc." The vote stood, ayes 1*794, noesl,o3(>. The Record Union yesterday morning stated that if there had been 27:* more affirmative votes polled the proposition would Lave carried, but this figuring has been assailed by a number of mathema ticians who claim that 9-4 votes was all that was needed. A negative vote counts as two affirmatives. Here is an opportu nity for mathematicians to get in and dis tinguish themselves. Auction Friday.— At 10 a. m.

Spagnolio, of Jackson, Amador connty, has been appointed a Notary Pub lic, vice self, term expired. Warden Aull, of the Folsom Prison, has stated that he will appoint as his clerk C. J. McFadden, of San Francisco. Work on the new American-river bridge has been temporarily stopped to allow the cement time to thoroughly settle. The pay-roll of the State Printing Office for the past two weeks was $4,95 l .J5, of which $2,081 ~'y is chargeable to the text book fund. Kudolph Joseph Schmitt, a native of Germany, was admitted to citizenship yes terday on the testimony of P. P. Jensen and H. P. Casey. At midnight the police had made the following arrests : An Sing, misdemeanor, by Deputy Sheriff Eldredf Miss Ah Ton, exhibiting, by officer Franks. Christian Koenig, who ;><>3aulted Paxton Mcßowell some months ago, was convicted and yesterday sentenced to nine months' imprisonment in the County Jail. A Democratic politician last night, after reading the President's message, said: "The Democratic war cry in the coming cam paign will be • Cleveland and free trade.' " J. H. Moon, a city contractor, is prepar ing to construct two houses on J street, be tween Twenty-fourth and Twenty-tifih streets. The coutract price is $1,1112 5u each. The new Federal Grand Jury, in San Francisco, has ignored the charges made Bgainst State Surveyor-General Reichert, in connection with the alleged Benson sur veying frauds. The residents in the vicinity of Twenty fourth and N want an electric light placed thereabouts. They complain that a num ber of tramps lounge around the school house at night, and make the locality dan gerous to travel. The average Signal Service temperature yesterday was oo°, being 1° warnier than the normal for that day. The highest and lowest temperature was 58° and 43°, with gentle southerly winds and cloudy to fair and clear weather. Citizens who have to pass the corner of Third and h streets at night think that a lamp should be placed on the southeast corner. This corner needs the attention of the Street Commissioner in regard to the approaches to the sidewalks. The Sacramento Immigration Associa tion has iisued a 20,000 edition of Hcsuurrci at' Northern and Central California for dis tribution throughout the East. The num ber contains much matter that will interest the Eastern reader, and attract attention to our section. The following is the report of the collec tions for the Howards at the polls Monday • Third and J streets, $3 20 ; Third and X streets, $0 05 ; Ninth and J streets, $3 56 ■ Tenth and X streets, $3 25 : Twelfth and H streets, $2 00 : Seventeenth and N streets, $8 05. Total collections, $27 01. Most people, no doubt, think that the Turks have departed from the city, but such is not the case. They are now camped on Twenty-fourth and T streets, and resi dents in that vicinity are already complain ing about them. Everyone within an area of one mile trom the camp has been asked to "shell out.'' All the members of the California Muse um Association, and the public generally, are requested to attend a meeting of the association to be held at the E. B. Crocker Art Gallery this evening, commencing at 7:.!0 o'clock. An interesting paper on '• Grape Culture," by James I. Felter, will be read before the association. The Secretary of the Marshall Monument Commission has received from I'lacerville Parlor, N. S. G. W., the deed for and the abstracts of the Marshall homestead. There is now nothing in the way of the Commis sion's proceeding with the work of erect ing the monument. A meeting will be held in a lew days, wheu plans and specifica tions will be adopted. If, as it is estimated, 200,000 Eastern tourists ami home-seekers will visit Califor nia this winter, why cannot the different Hoards of Trade of this part of the State, says the Woodland Democrat, go together and adopt some means to attract attention to the Sacramento valley .' The Sacramento valley can compare winters with any coun try in the world, and it would be a grand thing to have these Eastern people know it. Clear as a I ;<■!!. EDS. Kf.coru-Inion : Why should there be any doubt about there being more than 94 votes more required to have made the China slough abolition question affirma tive ! To me it is as clear as a bell. It is impossible to go wrong, il it is kept in view that 2,830 is the whole number of votes cast on the question. Noother whole number can be taken into account. Now, with the polls closed, and the whole num ber established, fixed, unchangeable, what have we? Whole number, 2,830 ; one-third of that is (of votes) 944: then two-thirds must be twice that, or 

I.RSB. The affirmative received 1,794, the negative 1,036— 0f what? why, of the whole number, 2,830. The difference, then, between 1,888 and 1,794 is just what the affirmative ought to have gained from the negative to win — to wit, 94 votes. But, some " ligurers " say, as the nega tive had 1,030, the affirmative, to have two thirds, must get two to one, or twice 1,036, which is 2,072. Therefore, they reason, what the allimative needed is the dill'er ence between 2,u7L' and 1.734, or L'TS. But can't these muddled figurers see that by this process they introduce a new whole number — an unknown quantity, a faUe premise and an unmathematical one — and that they really treat of 3. 108 votes, when they must be confined to the actual 2,830 cast . " Stand up primary class in arithmetic. John has seven apple?, Bob has eight. The two have fifteen. Now. there are no more apples in the world, the polls closed with just fifteen apples on earth. You, there, William, my son: that John may have two-thirds of all the apples in the" world, how should the Sacramento voters have divided them V " Please, sir. Bob should got two that John has, then he'd have ten and John five." " Bat, my lad, as John has seven, must not Bob get twice as many, fourteen, in order to size up John two to one?" "Oh, no, sir, for he can't get any ni"re apples, there are none ; he must get John to give up two, or wallop him until he does." " Right, my boy, go up to the head." COLBUBB. Ili-rc Comes Another. Ed-. Record-Union : Everybody has been figuring to-day on the result ot yes terday's election, and I find there is a dif ference of opinion as to the number of votes by which the slough-tilling proposi tion was lost. It strikes me that it was lost by just 04 votes. The total number cast was 2,830, two-thirds of which would be I.SBB, the number required to carry the ♦ax. But it only received 1,704 votes, or just 94 short of the necessary figure. Now, if 94 of these 1,036 who voted " No" had voted l; Aye,'' would not the 1,888 votes have been obtained, as required by law ? The vote would then stand : For the tax, 1,888; against, U42: total, 2,830. Two thirds of 2,830 (as already shown) is jnst 1,888. Thus, a change of !»4 votes from "no to "aye" would have carried the tax. Numbskull. Masonic Election. — Tehama Lodge, No. 3.F. and A.M. has elected the following offi cers for the ensuing term : W.

The following, from the San Francisco Chronicle, is an evil which is the subject of much comment in this city: ''The father of a child attending the public school in the Western Addition, called yesterday on Secretary Bennett of the Society for the Prevention of Vice, to make a complaint against the indecent pictures circulated in cigarette packages. He brought a handful with him which he had taken from his little boy, wbo was making an album of them after the manner of postage-stamp collectors. lie said the other boys were doing so, and exchanging with each other when they had tyro cr more of a kind. The worse the pictures were, or the more female nudity they displayed, the more they were in deirand, his son told him, and boys who did not smoke cigarettes themselves rivaled each other in begging the pictures from men who did smoke and did not care for the pictures. This he thought was a fruitful cause of demoralization among the youths of the city, and he asked if some thing could not be done to stop the sale of such pictures in cigarette packages. Mr. Bennett said that as the packages were not put up here, but at the East, mostly in New York, it would be difficult to reach the evil, which he recognized as a great one, but he would write to Anthony Corn stock about the matter at once, and see if something could not be done to abate the unbearable nuisance/ l'ollce Court. Yesterday's calendar in the I'olicc Court was short, and contained nothing of inter est. Antone Gregory, a drunk, was lined $."> or five days. The continued case of Mrs. Georgia Schwartz, charged with bat tery, was continued until December li'th. Jas. Mclntire, whose form has graced the police dock many times, stood up to hear the complaint of vagrancy read to him. He wanted a day to think the matter over, and the Court accordingly gave him until to-day to be tried. A iecess was then taken to await the prosecuting witness in the case of petit larceny against Al. Shenuan. In about fifteen minutes the desired luan arrived, and the trial proceed ed. The Court announced a verdict of " not guilty." Social Party. — To-night, at Grangers' Hall, Equity Lodge, Xo. 121'J, Knights and Ladies of Honor, will j^ive their first party.

" I suffered with catarrh 6or 8 years ; tried many wonderful cures, inhalers, etc., spend ing nearly one hundred dollars without benefit. I triod Hood's Sarsaparilla, and was greatly improved." SI. A . Aebev , Worcester, Mass. Hood's Sarsaparilla is characterized by three peculiarities : Ist, the combination of remedial agents; 2d, the proportion; 3d, the protest of securing the active medicinal qualities. The result is a medicine of unusual strength, effecting cures hitherto unknown. Send for book containing additional evidence.

Cai. Ladies' English Broadcloths. Fine Imported Broadcloths of rare excellence for ladies' tailor-made suits. As someone has said of these cloths, the wool is the finest carding, and spinning of the carefulest, weaving and finish of the highest order. Every point must be looked to to bring out such a perfect uniform fabric. Any let up would be fatal. No scrimp anywhere. Not how poor, but how good, the aim of the maker. And such dyeing ! Coloring as true and even as if nature spread the tint. Five colors, fifty-four inches wide. Price, $2 35 per yard. Some of these Broadcloths may be seen in our large show window to-day. 3,000 POPULATION. That's about the size of Dolldom at present. It's full of bright people, socially arranged in long lines and groups. Can you read thoughts ? There is no doubt what these dolls are thinking about. They are curious as to the new homes to which Santa Claus is to take them. Some few seem to be wondering if they are to remain over on the tiresome shelves for another year. (We don't intend they shall ; not if prices will push them out.) All in all, it's an interesting city, and strangely j. eo pled with only light hearts and happy faces. NOTION DEPARTMENT.
