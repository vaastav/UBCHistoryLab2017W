6 PRESIDENT CLEVELAND'S MESSAGE TO CONGRESS. (Continued from First Page.) central office in necessary investigation concerning matters of Postoffice leases, Postoffice sites, allowances for rents, fuel and lights, and in organizing and securing the best results from the work of the 14,ii00 clerks now employed in first and s cond class offices. I am convinced that the small ex pense attending the inauguration of thaw reforms would actually be a l.rofitable investment. I especially recommend such a re casting of the appropriations by Con gress for the Postoffice Department as will permit the Postmaster-General to proceed with the work of consolidating Postoffiees. This work has already been entered upon sufficiently to fully demonstrate by experiment and experi ence that i aeh consolidation is produc tive of better service, larger revenues and less expenditures, to say nothing of the furiher advantage of gradually withdrawing Postoffices from the spoils system. 

UNIVBRSAX, POSTAL, UNION. The Universal Postal Union which now embraces all the civilized world and whose delegates will represent 1,000, --000,000 people, will hold Its fifth Con gress In the city of Washington in May, 1897. The United States may be said to have taken the initiative which led to the first meeting of this Congress in Berne in 1N74, and the formation of the Universal Postal Union, which brings the postal service of all countries to every man's neighborhood and has wrought marvels in cheapening postal rates and securing absolutely safe mail communication throughout the world. THE NAVY. Work of Constructing New Vessels Energetically Prosecuted. The work of the Navy Department and Its condition are fully exhibited in the report of the Secretary. The construc tion of vessels for our new navy has been energetically prosecuted by the piesent administration upon the general lines previously adopted, the depart ment having seen no necessity for radi cal changes in prior methods under which the work was found to be pro gressing in a manner highly satisfac tory. It has been decided, however, to provide in every ship-building contract that the builder should pay all trial ex penses, and it has also been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. The premiums recently earned and some yet to be decided are features of the contracts made before this conclusion was reached. It is gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed to be equal to the best that can be manu factured elsewhere, and that such nota ble reductions have been made in their cost as to justify the statement that quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at rates as low as those that prevailed in European shipyards. Our manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for all possible naval contingencies. Three of our Govern ment navy yards, those at Mare Island, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn are equipped for shipbuilding. Our ord nance plant in Washington is equal to any in the world, and at the torpedo sta tion we are successfully making the highest grades of smokeless powder. Three first-class private shipyards, at Newport News, Philadelphia and San Francisco, are building battleships, and eleven contractors situated in the States of Maine, Rhode Island. Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia and the State of Washington, are constructing gunboats or torpedo boats. Two plants are manu acturing large quantities of first-olass armor and American factor ies are producing auto-mobile torpedo and powder projectiles, rapid-fire guns and everything else necessary for the complete outfit of naval vessels. SI HPS IN RESERVE. Discipline among officers and men of The navy has been maintained to a high standard and the percentage of Am-ri t?.n eitiz ns enlisted has been very much incr ased. The Secretary is con sidering and will formulate during the coming winter a plan for laying up Ships, in reserve, thereby largely reduc ing the cost of maintaining our vessels Etl mt. This plan contemplates that :tleships, torpedo boats and such of the cruisers as are not needed for active .- rvice at sea shall be kept in reserve v. ith skeleton crews on board to keep them in condition, cruising only enough to insure the efficiency of the ships and their crews in time of activity. The economy to result from this system is too obvious to need comment. NAVAL MILITIA. The r.aval militia which was author ized a few years ago as an experiment has now developed into a body of en terprising young men active and ener getic in tiie discharge of their duties and prom.sing great usefulness. INTI RIOR DEPARTfIENT. Matters Which the President Calls Attention To. The report of the Secretary of the in terior pre nts a comprehensive and in teresting exhibit of the numerous and Important affairs committed to his su pervision. It is Impossible in this com munication to do more than briefly re fer to a f w of the subjects concerning which the Secretary gives full and in structive information. The money appropriated on account of this d partrnent for its disburse ment for the fiscal year ended June Ho, IMMi, amounted to more than 51.">7, --000,060, or a greater sum than was ap propriated for the entire maintenance of the Government for the two fiscal years ended June 30, 189 L 

PUBLIC LANDS. Our pulllic lands, originally amount ing to L 840,000,000 acres, have been BO reduced that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain In Government con trol, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the most valuable portion, has been given away to settlers, to Dew St.it' and to railroads or sold at a comparatively nominal sum. The patenting of land in execution of railroad grants has progressed rapidly during the year, and since the 4th day of March, 1893, about 25,000,000 acres have thus been conveyed to those cor porations I agree with the Secretary that the r mainder of our public lands should be more carefully dealt with, and their alienation guarded by better economy and great r prudence. The commission appointed from the membership of the National Academy of Sciences, provided for by an Act of Congress to formulate plans for a na tional forestry system, will, it is hoped, poon be prepared to present the result of thorough and intelligent examina tion of this important subject. THE 

INDIANS. The total Indian population of the United States i 3 177.235 according to a census made in 1895, exclusive of those within the State of New York and those comprising the five civilized tribes. Of this number there are ap proximately 38,000 children of school age. During the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended recent efforts to extend Indian school facilities and the anticipation of continued liberal appro priations to that end, cannot fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of In dian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization. It may be said in general terms that in every particular the improvement of the Indians under Government has been most marked and encouraging. The Secretary, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and agents having charge of Indians to whom allotments have been made, strongly urge the passage of a law prohibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who have taken their lands in severalty. I earnestly join in this recommendation, and venture to express the hope that the Indian may be speedily protected against this one greatest of all evils to his well-being and advancement. The condition of affairs among the five civilized tribes who occupy large tracts of land in the Indian Territory, and who have governments of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of those Indian to the gen eral Government. This seems to be necessary in furtherance of their own interests as well as for the protection of non-Indian residents in their Terri tory. 

PENSIONS. The diminution of our enormous pen sion roil and the decrease of pension expenditures, which have been so often confidently foretold, still fail in mate rial realization. The number of pen sioners on the rolls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1890, was 970,678. This is the largest number ever reported. The amount paid exclu sively for the pensions during the year was $138,214,761 I*4, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expenditures on account of pensions, including the cost of main taining the department and expenses: attending the pension distributions amounted to $142,206,550 59, or within a very small fraction of one-third of the entire expense of supporting the Gov ernment during the same year. The number of new pensions certifi cates issued was 911.040. Of these 40, --374 represent original allowances of claims and 15,878 increase of existing pensions. The number of persons re ceiving pensions from the United States but residing in foreign countries at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during tli year was $582,735 38. The sum appropriated for the pay ment of pensions for the current fiscal year ending June 30, 1897, is $140,000, --000, and for the succeeding year it is estimated that the same amount will be necessary. The Commission* r of Pensions reports that during the last fiscal year 339 In dictments W re found against violators of the pension laws. Upon these indict ments 107 convictions resulted. In my opinion, based upon such statements as tii' se and much other information and observation, the abuses which have been allow ed to cre< p into our pensions have done incalculable harm in demor alizing cur people and undermining good citizenship. I have endeavored within my sphere of Official duty to protect our pension 4«aid make it what it should be—a roll of honor, contain ing the names of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of their country's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who pose as the soldiers' friends, active and alert in urging greater laxity and more reck less pension expenditure, while nursing selfish schemes. I have- deprecated the approach Of a situation when necessary retrenchment and enforced economy may lead to an attack upon pension abuses, so determined as to overlook tie- discrimination due to those who, worthy of a national care, ought to live and die under the protection of a nation's gratitude. PACIFIC RAILROADS. The Secretary calls attention to the public int rests involved in an adjust ment of the Obligations of the Pacific railroads to tie- Government. I deem it to be an important duty to espe cially present this subject to the con sideration of the Congress. On January t, 1597, with the amount already matured, more than $13,000, --000 of the principal of the subsidy bonds Issued by the United States In aid of the construction of the Union Pacific Railway, including the Kansas line, and more thin $6,000,000 of like bonds Issued in aid of the Central Pa cific Railroad, Including those issued to the Western Pacific Railroad Com pany, will have fallen due and been paid, or must on that day be paid by the Government, Without any refer ence to the application of the sinking fund now in the treasury, this will cre ate such a default em the part of these c ompanies to the Government as will give it the right to at once Institute proceedings to foreclose its mortgage lien. In addition to this indebtedness which will be die January L 1897, there will mature b< tween that date and January I, 1899, the , -Training principal of such lUbsidy bends, which must also be met by th-> Government. These amount to more than $20,000,000 >n account of the Union Pacific lines, and exceed $21,000, --000 ..ri a.. ount of the < - . ntral Pacific lines. I ne situation of these roads and the condition ot their indebtedness to the Government bav< been fully set forth in the reports <-f various committer's to the present and prior Congresses, and as e al ly us 1887 they wire their oughly examined by a special comm!* --ie-i aiqo.nt d pursuant to an Act of Congress. The consideration requir ing an adjustment of the Government's: relations to th Companies have been clearly presented, and the conclusion reached with practical uniformity, thit sf these relation* are not terminated they should be revised upon a basis se eming their sate continuance. Under a section of the Act of Con pc ■ d March isst. the Presi leni Is charged with the duty, in the event that an> mortgage or other in- CUmbrance paramount to the Interest of the United States in the property of the Pacific railroads shall exist and be lawfully iisble to be enforced, to di rect the action of the Departments of the T:e. lsl: ,y an 1 of Justice in the pro te tion ~f the int. rest of the United States by redemption, or through Judi cial proceedings, Including foreclosure of tie- Oovemment liens. in vi( w of tii.- fact thai Congress has for a number ot years almost constant ly hs I undk r consideration various plane for dealing with the conditions existing between these roads and the Government, 1 have thus far felt justi fied in withholding action under the statute above mentioned. In the case SACRAMEiNTO iDAIEY 

RECORD-TINTON, TUESDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1896. of the Union Pacific, however, the sit uation has become especially and im mediately urgent. Proceedings have been instituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon these aided parts of the main line upon which the Government holds a second and subordinate mort gage lien. In consequence of these proceedings and increasing complica tion added to the default occurring on the first day of January, 181)7, a condi tion will be presented at that date so far as this company is concerned that must emphasize the mandate of the Act of 1887 and give to executive duty under its provisions a more imperative aspect. Therefore, unless Congress shall oth erwise direct, or shall have previously determined upon a different solution of the problem, there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delaying be yond the date of the default above mentioned such executive action as will promise to subserve the public Interests and save the Government from the loss threatened by further inaction. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. Should Receive the Care and Encour agement of the Government. The Department of Agriculture is so intimately related to the welfare of our people and the prosperity of our Nation that it should constantly receive the care and encouragement of the Govern in. nt. From small beginnings It has grown to be the center of agricultural intelligence and the source of aid anil encouragement to agricultural efforts. Large sums of money are annually ap propriated for the maintenance of this department, and it must be confessed that the legislation relating to it has not always been directly in the interest of practical farming or properly guard ed against waste and extravagance. So far, however, the public money has been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help those who actually till the oil. No expenditure has been more pofita bly made or more generally approved by the people. Under the present management of the departments its usefulness has been en hanced in every direction, and at the same time strict economy has been en forced to the utmost extent permitted by Congressional action. From the reports of the Secretary it appears that through careful and prudent financial management he has annually saved a large sum from his appropriations, ag gregating during his incumbency and up to the close of the fiscal year nearly one-fifth of the entire amount appro priated. The Secretary* reports that the value of our exports of farm products during the last fiscal year amounted to $570. --000.000, an increase of $17,000,000 over those of the year "mediately preceding. The large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products suggests the great usefulness of the organization lately established in the department for the purpose of giving to those engaged in farming pursuits reliable informa tion concerning the condition, needs and advantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of the farmer depends upon the advan tageous sale of his products and inas much as foreign markets must largely be the destination of such products, it it quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that affect those markets ought to result in sow ing more intelligently and reaping with a better promise of profit. Such information points out the way to a prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of crops and to a re lease from the bondage of unreasoning monotony of production, a glutted and depressed market, and constantly re curring unprofitable toil. In ray opinion the gratuitous distri bution of seeds by the department as at present conducted ought to be discon tinued. No one can read the statement of the Secretary on this subject and doubt the extravangance and ques tionable results of this practice. The professed friends of the farmer, and certainly the farmers themselves, are naturally expected to be willing to rid a department devoted to the promo tion of farming interests of a feature, which tends so much to it's discredit. 

WEATHER BUREAU. The Weather Bureau, now attach o ! to the Department of Agriculture, has continued to extend its Sphere of use fulness and by an uninterrupted im provement in th? accuracy of its fore casts has greatly increased its efficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupations are related to weather con ditions. Omitting further reference to the op erations r.f the department. I commend the Secretary's report and the sug gestions it contains to the careful con sideration of the Congress. CIVIL SERVICE. j Gratifying Progress Hade in This De partment. The progress made in civil service re form calls tor the utmost congratula tions. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as tho rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent place among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and to Improve, 1 • conomlse nad elevate the public serv ice. There are now In the competitive , classified service upward of S4.<«>o j places. More than half of these have i been Included from time to time since Manh 4. 1 s'.t.'J. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by exeeu ! Ore order dated the oth day of May. 1896, and If fourth-class Poetmaster ! ships are not included in the state- I ment, it may be said that practically all I positions contemplated by the civil j service law are now classified. Abun ! dant reasons exist for including these Postmastershtps, based upon economy, ! Improved service and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at pres ent, 1 • arnestly hope that Congress will, without im renslng Postoffice appropri ations, so adjust them as to permit, in proper cases, a consolidation of these PoStofflCes, to the end that through this process the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished. The civil service rules as amended during the last year provide for a sen sible and uniform method of promo tion, basing eligibility to better posi tions Upon demonstrated efficiency an 1 faithfulness. The absence of fixed rules on this subject has been an in firmity in the system more and more apparent as its other benefits have been i better appre< iated. I The advantage of civil service meth ods in their business aspects are too w il understood to require argument. Their application has become a neces sity to the executive work of the Gov ernment. Hut those who gain positions through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that the non-partisan scheme through which they receive their appointments de mands from thenv, by way of reciproc ity, non-partisan and faithful per formance of duty under every admin istration and cheerful fidelity to every chief. While they should be encour aged to decently exercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their suffrages the political beliefs they honestly profess, the noisy, pestilent and partisan employe who loves politi cal turmoil and contention, or who renders lax and grudging service to an administration not representing bis political views, should be promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such a way as to furnish a warning to others who may be likewise disused. The annual report of the Commis sioners will be duly transmitted, and I commend the important matter they have in charge to the careful consid eration of the Congress. INTERSTATE COMMERCE. The Commission Supplies Abundant Evidence of Usefulness. The Interstate Commerce Commission has during the last year supplied abundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work committed to Its charge. Public, transportation Is a universal necessity, and the question of just and reasonable charges therefor has become one of vital importance not only to shippers and carriers, but also to the vast multitude of producers and con sumers. The justice and equity of the princi ples embodied in the existing law passed for the purpose of regulating these charges are everywhere conceded, and there appears to be no question that the policy thus entered upon has a permanent place in our legislation. As the present statute when enacted was, in the nature of the case, more or less tentative and experimental, it was hardly expected to supply a complete and adequate system. While its whole some effects are manifest and have amply justified its enactment, it is evi dent that all desired reforms in trans portation methods have not been fully accomplished. In view of the judicial Interpretation with which some provisions of this stat ute have been received, and the de fects disclosed by the efforts for its en forcement," its revision and amendment appear to be essential to the end that it may more effectually reach the evils designed to tie corrected. I hope the recommendations of the commission upon this subject will be promptly and favorably considered by the Congress. THE 

TARIFF. Revenues Should Only be Sufficient to Meet Necessary Expenses. I desire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the Govern ment's receipts and expenditures for the purjMise of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operations. This statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may be its shortcom ings a complete measure of tariff re form, it must be conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of commodities between us and other countries, thus furnishing a wider market for our products and manufacture. The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports increased over those of the prevjous year more than $6,500,000, while the value of the do mestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly $70. --000,000 more than during the preced ing year. Those who Insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be increased through tariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the ex pense of the Government, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of Government revenue, and with the additional purpose of increas ing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and pro ducers better and more profitable op portunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the Gov ernment to meet the necessary expenses of it maintenance. Considered as to its sufficiency in this aspect, the present law can by no means fall under just condemnation. During the only complete fiscal year of its operation it has yielded nearly $8, --000,000 more revenue than was re ceived from tariff duties in the preced ing year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit between our receipts and ex penditures of a little more than $25,- I ,000. This, however, was not ex pected. The situation was such in De cember, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the Secretary of the Treasury foretold a deficiency of $17.0<)0.i)<Mi. The great and incroasi , lg apprehension and timidity in business circles and the depression in all activi ties intervening since that time result ing from causes perfectly well under stood, and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its operation, seri ously checked the imports we would have otherwise received, and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the Secretary and the ac tual deficiency as well as for a con tinued deficit. Indeed, it must be con fessed that we could hardly have had a more unfavorable period than the last two years for the collection of a tariff revenue. We cannot reasonably hope that our recuperation from this business depres sion will be sudden, but it has already set in with a promise of acceleration and continuance. I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical ex penditures will overcome all deficien cies. En the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit we have in the Treasury, In addition to a gold reserve, one hundred million, a surplus of more than one hundred and twenty-eight millions of dollars ap plicable to the payment of the expenses of the Governnw nt. and which must, unless expended for that purpose, re main a useless heard, or, if not extrav agantly wasted, must In any event be perverted from the purpose of its ex action from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the rev enue from this fund is nothing more than its proper and legitimate use. The Government thus applying a sup plus, fortunately in its treasury, to the payment of expenses not met by its current revenues, is not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his in come, and thus incurring debt or en croaching on his principal. It is not one of the functions of our Government to accumulate and make additions to a fund not needed for immediate ex penditure. With individuals it is the chief object of struggle and effort. The application of an accumulated fund by the Government to the payment of its running expenses is a duty. An indi vidual living beyond his income and embarrassing himself with debt, of drawing upon his accumulated fund of principal, is either unfortunate or im provident. The distinction is between a government charged with the duty of expending for the benefit of the peo pie and for proper purposes all the money it receives from any source and the individual who is expected to man ifest a natural desire to avoid debt, or to accumulate as much as possible and to live within the income derived from such accumulations, to the end that they may be increased, or at least re main unimpaired for the future use and enjoyment of himself and objects of his love and affection who may sur vive him. It is immeasurably better to appro priate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appro priations and extravagant expenditures. I suppose it will not be denied that under the present law our people ob tain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than form erly. This is a matter of supreme im portance, since it is the duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. The people should not be required to relin quish this privilege of cheap living, ex cept under the stress of their govern ments, necessarily made plainly mani fest. OUR 

FINANCIAL METHODS. The President Points Their Weakness and Vices. This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenue naturally sug gests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of Congress in previous Ex ecutive communications, and the inev itable danger of their continued toler ation pointed out. Without now re peating these details, I cannot refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance, and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and per plexity. Tie- terrible civil war, which shock th>- foundations of our Government more than thirty years ago, brought m its train the destruction of property, the wasting of our country's substance and the estrangement of brethren. These an- now past and forgotten. Even the distressing le>ss of life the conflict emtailed is but a sacred memory which fosters patriotic sentiment, and keeps alive a tender regard for those who no bly died. And yet there remains wdth us to-day, in lull strength as an inci dent of that tremendous struggle, a feature of its financial necessities, net emly unsuited to our present circum stances, but manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever-present agent of monetary dis tress. Because we may be enjoying a temporary relief from its depressing influence, this should not lull us into a false security nor lead us to forget the suddenness of past visitations. 

PAPER CURRENCY SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. I am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the Government cur rency obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the treasury are withdrawn from circulation and can celled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended, by legislation for long-term bonds, bearing a low rate of Interest, or by their redemption with the prex-e.-ds of such bonds. Even if only the United States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired, it is probable that the treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the Act of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded, would not cremate such disturbance as they might from time to time when received in the treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, be gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin. This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly ap pears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction if currency obliga tions redeemable in gold, whenever bo redeemed, should be cancelled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but it would improve present conditions. National banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to issue circulation to their par value of bonds deposited as security for its re demption, and the tax on their circula tion should be reduced to one-fourth of one per cent. In considering projects for the r e tirement of United States notes a n (3 of 1800. I am of the opinion that we have placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the currency and have calculated too light upon the gold that would be added to our circulation if invited to us by better and safer financial methods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency thit should be avoided ns unequal distribu tion. This might be obviated and any fear of harmful contraction at the same time removed by allowing the organi zation of smaller banks and in less populous communities than are now permitted and authorizing banks to es tablish branches in small communities under proper restriction. 

ABANDON THE BANKING BUSI- The entire rase may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial method will not dawn upon us until our Government abandons the banking business and the accumulation of funds and confines Its monetary operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for its support, and to the expenditure of such money for the people's benefit Our business interests and nil good citizens long for rest from feverish agi tation and the inauguration by the Gov ernment of a reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise anil make certain the rewards of labor and industry. TRUSTS. The President Says They Are Very Harmful to the People. Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge ag gregations of capital, the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade indus try* or commerce and so stifle whole some competition. When these are de fended it is usually on the ground that though they increase profit they also reduce prices and thus may benefit the public. It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of prices to the peo ple is not one of the real objects of these, organizations, nor is their ten dency necessarily in that direction. If it occurs in a particular case, it is only because it accords with the purpose or interest of those managing the scheme. Such occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable evils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency is to crush cut individual independence and to hin der or prevent the freer use of human i faculties and the full development of I 

FREE iBUTTQgyS! I AN ELEGANT BUTTON FREE 1 with each package of I SWEET CAPORAL I CIGARETTES B AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE I A COLLECTION OF BUTTONS H WITHOUT COST. human character. Through them the farmer, the artisan and the small trader is in danger of dislodgment from the proud position of being his own master, watchful of all that touches his country's prosperity, in which be has an individual lot and interested In all that affects the advantages of busi ness, of which he is a factor, to be rele gated to the level of a mere appurte nance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of pas sive obedience, and with little hope or opportunity of rising in the scale of re sponsible and healthful citizenship. To the instinctive belief that such is the inevitable trend of trusts and monopo lies is due the widespread and deep seated popular aversion in which they are held, and the not unreasonable in sistence that whatever may be their in cidental economic advantages, thei* general effect upon personal Oharact r, prospects and usefulness cannot be otherwise than injurious. Though Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not be cause of any lack of disposition, or at tempt to enforce them, but simply be cause the laws themselves as inter preted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the insufficiency of exist ing laws can be remedied by further legislation, it should be done. It should be recognized, however, that all finan cial legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of the complex character of our govern mental system, which, while making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by bounds which cannot be transfigured. The decision of our highest court on the precise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can be adequately treated through Federal action, unless they seek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or inter course between States or between the United States and foreign countries. It does, not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied, even though it may be found that the Federal authorities are not broad enough to fully reach the case. There can be no doubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power. THE PRESIDENT'S LAST WORDS. An Appeal to Congress for the nost Rigid Economy. In concluding this communication its last words shall be an appeal to the Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money it holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance is easy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is considered that those who can bear the burdens of taxation have no guaranty of honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants, the duty of all possible retrenchment is plainly manifest. When our differ ences are forgotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer remem bered, nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well performed, and the memory of a constant devotion to the interests of our confiding fellow-countrymen.
