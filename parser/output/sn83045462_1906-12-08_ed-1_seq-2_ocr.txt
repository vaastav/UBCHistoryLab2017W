WHITE HOUSE Timothy Woodruff Calls by Appointment. I ONLY BRIEF CONFERENCE i Made a Date Later in the Day for Hew York's Chairman. TOO MUCH LAHD WITHDRAWN TT7U-4. T)? ^1.1.: _ ? w iml xvcjuesciiiuuvc xnuiiueii ui Wyoming Says About the Public I Lands in His Locality. Timotliy Woodruff, republican state chairman of New York, called at the White House this morning; at 11 o'clock for a talk with the chief executive about New York political mutters and appointments. There Were so many people in the President's oTfices that there was no opportunity for a satisfactory conference, and the President me visu 10 a later inn'1 111 me day. Among the many other things Mr. Woodruff will take up with the President will be that of the nomination of a judge for the eastern district of New York. There are ] five strong candidates. Mr. Woodruff has stated that he does not propose to personally push either of the men in the field, but , that he w:li be contented to leave the whole thing in the hands of the President, in which event it is extremely probable t ha t the nominee will lie Thomas Chatfield. Mr. Woodruff prefers Ohatfield's appointment as well as the President. Senator Piatt paid his first visit of the i congressional season to the White House ecarly In the morning, but did i;ot remain long. When he went out he said his visit concerned "some trout!" over Cooley's appointment but it has all been settled and ( he will be appointed." The Cooley referred to was the former civil service commis- ; floner who was recently made an assistant attorney general of the Department of Justice. It was supposed that Senator Piatt Ii'oc ? W ? .. . >T - /"I ~ ~ 1 iTu.i n"i * uiisuiuii ainrui an. f a|'pokiment and wanted to know about it. Oscar Stranse of New Tork. wlio will he the next Secretary of the Department of < Commcroi' and L?abor. was another New York visitor to the White House. A Joke on Woodruff. The President had a good joke at the ex- ' pense of Chairman Woodruff. The well- J known New Yorker was accompanied to the White House by Representative Calder, who jokingly said: "Mr. President, I want 1 to introduce Timothv Woodruff " "Woodruff. Woodruff." said the President meditatively, "seems to me I have heard ' that name." "Tim Woodruff." put in Calder. < "Oh, yes," laughed the President. "Now i I remember: I believe he has something of i a local reputation over in New York." Too Much Land Withdrawn. } Representative Mondell of Wyoming dis- t f ussed with the President ' iday suggestions ' in the President's message as to coal lands in the wes:. Mr. Mondell agrees that some- ( thing should be done, but his mind is not 1 fu'.ly made up as to what it should he. He is satisfied, though, that entirely too much land, alleged to contain coal, is now withdrawn frum settlement under the recent or- . der of the President "Something like ir>.- 1 (MKt oOn acres of land, reputed to contain coal in some form, are not subject to entry," said Mr. Mondell. "although millions of this lias no semblance of coal in it. and t has been prospected over hundreds of times s without resuit. I know an instance right k n.-ar the small town I live in where acres are withdrawn ' om entry. There is not a spark of merchantable c lal upon these lands, and never has been. 1 think something should be one to resto.e much of thiS large domain to public entry." Dewey Wants Younger Men. e Admiral Dewey, whose reception at the ] White Hoh*c is always most cordial, was a a visitor to the chief executive today. Ad- ; miral Dewey is a strong advocate of younger men to command the fighting vessels of the United States, and that was the subject of Ids talk. "We must have younger men to command the ships." he declared. "How can the change be brought about?" I he was asked.. 'Well. CnrprfSS will have In nasc Hia ( necessary legislation, of course," tie sild, . "but we must retire our officers earlier. ' That's the only way to do it." , Admiral Dewey met Secretary Taft as the latter was walking into the executive of- ^ flees and they had a warm chat. Secretary Taft spent some time with the President. Half-Holiday for Navy Yard. 1 Representative Southard has secured j from the President a promise that he will issue an order granting to navy yard employes in Washington a half holiday on ( Christmas eve the same as other employes 1 of the government.

Representative Southard lias looked after the interests of T the navy yard people for a number of rj years. ^ Mark Twain visited the President today _ a to interest him in the copyright bill pend- r ing in Congress.

From the evidence elicited at the hearing it appears that- Logan was the promoter of a colored treatrical troupe, from Washington, known as the "Happy Days in Dixie,' which was to have given a performance at the opera house, under the auspices of a colored organization known as the "Minutemen," Thursday night last, and when the time came for the curtain to rise the performers .made a hasty retreat from the play house and in a few minutes thereafter there were a number clamoring for their admission fees. Judge Caton de cided that I^ogan had not obtained any , money under false pretenses and that he was simply guilty of a breach of contract, and accordingly dismissed the case and informed the officers of the club that they ] could, if they wanted, take civil action against I-ogau for breach of contract. Logan was represented by Attorney Robinson Moncure. Funeral of George G. Hendrickson. Funeral services over the remains of George G.

PERSONALITY President Roosevelt the Leadinn Wndfl Pinnro >1VXJ VI VI IU I^UI VI AUTOGfiAUC DEVELOPMENT Where Will His Seven-Lcague Boots Carry Him? A SUGGESTIVE PARALLEL Significant Quotation From the Inaugural Address of William Henry Harrison. To the Editor if The Star: It requires no vast flight of the imagina Hon for us to conjecture our magnificent and magnetic President as seeing in liis dreams a vision when the whole world in "suppliance bent, shall tremble at his power." In seven league boots has he been traveling since the first day when he mounted the throne of the While House. He has achieved a long stretch of the distance between democracy and autocracy, and unless all signs fail, it will not be long before he reaches the end of his Journey. It is singular indeed that no popular alarm is awakened in consequence. It is exactly as cne of the leading news papers or tne country said very recently: "The people think It is right because Roosevelt does it." Is it not enough to endanger the balance of the strongest and most massive intellect? No military chieftain, no statesman of whatever grasp ever took such strong hold of the affections and confidence of the people. Not insidiously, not step by step, for never has education been so rapid, have the people been brought to that point wuere iney view wiiu L,uiupwccm;j', <*nu n truth b? told, with approbation, the assumption of unelrcumscrijied individual prerogative and Individual concentration of power. It must be that public pride is an influential factor in forming such a condition. A distinguished Englishman, in a distinguished gathering in that country, said our President is the foremost character in the civilized world. So it seems to be. Certainly there is no man in the world more talked about than he, certainly no man who has more impressed his personality upon national and international affairs. To the mass of the people at home, he has become a veritable "little father." Witness the appeal just made to him by the Jew butchers of New lork city to use his good offices to settle a dispute between them and their customers over the price of beef. It Is a marvelous condition, but us every one appears to be satisfied, there would be no profit in moralizing over it. If there is anything left affecting the public or private affairs of the people of this country that the President has not indicated a disposition to regulate he can be depended upon to tackle It when he comes around to it. It would not he becoming nor perhaps fair to attribute a spectacular ambition to our President, but if it was any one else that charge would pro-bably be made. His message will keep Congress on the jump until the 4th of March, and his name will be in the mouths of men more than that of any other. Judging by the past we need not anticipate that a halo of auiet will settle around the nresl dentlal head when Congress adjourns. The President likes battleships, and he has proved he likes a sea trip. I have heard the suggestion that next spring or summer it may enter his, brain to take a great fleet of battleships and sail to ICurope. Why not? What a grand, splendid time he would have, and how his countrymen would We thrilled by the adulation,- ovation. and celebration which would encompass him! I am just looking over the inaugural address of William Henry Harrison, made March 4, 1841. Harrison had a great record and wide experience before he came to the White House. He had long been in the midst of party politics, and. as you know, party politics were exceedingly bitter in those days. Harrison was a statesman of distinction. He had been governor of the northwest teritorv when rare Qualities of prudence and judgment were called for. He had served In the state senate of Ohio and In both houses of Congress. He was also a warrior of renown, a true "man on horseback." He won splendid laurels in the war of 1812, and he was a great Indian fighter and Indian pacificator. It is most interesting and, I think, most apropos to recall at this time what this famous and idolized military chieftain, this "man on horseback," said on the subject of executive power. He premised thus: "I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it hne hppri tlinlfm?5iirn nf t Jin rion rtl a tn mit to my hands, etc." Speaking of the grants and limitations of power prescribed by the Constitution to the several departments composing the government, and the variety of constructions put upon the same, he said: "But the great danger to our institutions 3-oes not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the government of power not grant?d by the people, but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others." Touching upon the "tendency of power to increase Itself, particularly when exer- ' ised by a single individual," he advocated one term only fcr the President so that he should not forget "he is the accountable agent, not the principal, the servant, not thf? mastpr " As to the power conferred upon the . President by the Constitution, he said: "I cannot conceive that by a fair con- 1 struction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the President a. part of the legislative power." The veto power and the power to recommend measures he asserted "was not intended to make tlim the source in legislation." In conclusion, he said: "All the influence I possess shall be exerted to prevent the l formation at least of an executive party | in me nan* 01 me legislative oixiy. J wisn ; for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds his appointment." It seems as if this was pretty good reading, although It is sixty-five years old. F. A

GILLETTE WILL MOVE WOULD TAKE HIS CELL DECORATIONS TO AUBURN. S]>eoial Dispatch to Tlie Star. HERKIMER, N. Y.. December S?Chester Gillette appears to enjoy life now better than before he was convicted of murder in the first degree. The presence of tlie guards with him day and night gives him more opportunity for recreation and companlonsh'p than he had before and he tithes full advantage of it. Last night he kept his guards playing "seven up" with him far into the night and seemed to enjoy the game immensely. The guards suggested several times that it whs bed time, but Gillette insisted on continuing. and it was 1 o'clock this morning: Ix^rorc he was ready to sleep. During the evening he talked a great deal with his guards about his chances of securing a new trial, asking them questions about it and seeming somewhat worr ?l, but on the whole he was in good spirits. He sleeps soundly and his appetite certainly has not suffered in the least. To Auburn on Monday. Soon after his Incarceration in the jail here last July Gillette proceeded to transform his cell into a sort of parlor, arranging small pictures and post cards on the walls in c!ever designs, and otherwise devising little plans to mak?> his narrow quarters more inviting to the eye. Today ho asked I'lwler Sheriff Klock if when lie is taken to the death cell in Auburn prison after his sentence Monday he would be permitted to take along these small tokens to decorate his cell there. He snid he particularly desired to retain possession of several trinkets of a decorative design which his little sister had sent him. Under Sheriff Kloek informed the youthful murderer that he could carry the cards and pictures to Auburn with him, but that he could give him no assurance that the authorities there would permit him to use them in decorating his cell. Gillette will be taken to Auburn Monday immediately after sentence is imposed. He will pack h:s few belongings tomorrow, though this forenoon he suggested to his guards that he supposel he might leove them, as he was convinced he would be back in the Herkimer jali shortly to attend nis seoona m?i, wiuca ne iee:b positive vi.( be granted by the court of ajipeils.
