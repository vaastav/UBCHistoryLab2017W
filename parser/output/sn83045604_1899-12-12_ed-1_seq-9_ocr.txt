Reviewing the events of the past year •t Wardner, Idaho, President Gompers de clared that from the best sources available be learns# that the destruction or property of the Baker HUi and Sullivan mines was the act of unorganized miners. Of the corralling of 1,200 miners by the state au thorities, aided by Gen.

If, as tileged. the Imprisoned men are guilty, the)- at least should be given a fair trial before a Jury of their peers, confronted with their accusers, and, If guilty, pun- Uhed; If Innocent, they should be given their liberty and their wrongs should be redreaaed.

The killing of inno cent men upon the public highway of Lat timer, the shooting down of unarmed men at Buffalo, the Incarceration of workmen guilty of no offense In Idaho, and the out lawry of organised labor must tie frowned down upon: must be met with the con-< sclouaness of our rights, the manhood to atclare them and the -determination to achieve them."

GERMANY'S NAVAL PROGRAMME. Von Hnelow Make* a Strong Appeal for More Veaael*. BERLIN, Dec. 11.—During the debate on tbe estimates In the relchstag today Count Von Buelow. the minister of foreign affairs, reiterated the terms of the various agree ment* for partitioning Samoa between the United States and Germany, for repealing the Samoan act and for submitting to ar bitration the losses resulting from unjusti fiable military action on the part of offi cers belonging to either of the states. He said that after the assent of the United States and the hundesrath bills ratifying the treaty would be submitted. In the meanwhile he hoped the iClclutag would not discuss the matter. He added that no In crease In nert year's Imperial budget would arise from the supplemental estimates for Samoa. Prince Hohenlobe, the Imperial chancel lor, then announced that the Federal gov ernment had come to the conclusion that the present navy was insufficient for the country's needs, and that estimates for doubling the present number of warships would be submitted. He added that the period within which the Increase of the new navy would be affected was not to be ftjed by law, the number of new ships to be provided for an nually In the estimates decided In accordance with the urgency requirements. Count Von Ituelow, In supporting the proposed Increase In the navy, said: "The president of the I'nlted States in his message, expressed himself conct rninit tho good relations between the United States and ourselves with a warmth that fills us with sincere satisfaction. As far a? Great Britain Is concerned wa are willing and ready to live In peace and concord with her on the basis of full reciprocity and rectproeal consideration." Count Von Buelow also Justified the in crease In the navy from a political point of view and declared Germany's policy had nlwavs maintained an even course be tween neglecting and overdoing trans oceanic interests. Alluding to the warlike changes and rev olutions of the past few years he said: "We must be assured against surprise not only on land but at sea. We must cieit" and possess a fleet strong enough to exclude at tack bv any podfer and I emphasize attack, for in the absolute peacefulness of our pol icy It can never he other than a question of defense, German foreign pollcv ig neith er covetous, restless nor fanciful. "In the coming century the German peo ple must be either the hammer or the anvil. Tn tho name of the country's best Interest I entreat your favorable reception of the navy bill."

Except the Tgrklth Repre* aentallve General Opinion In dorse* It Aa an Able State Fa per. Special Dispatch to the Post-Intelllgenc*r. WASHINOTON, Dec. 11.—Comment on the president's message la almost wholly favorable among public men here. It la regarded as one of the Ablest state papers of recent years, and by all means the boldest declaration Mr. McKlnley has made he became president. The unusual lengtff of the document made Its reading drag tlresomely In both house and senate, and the majority of the mem bers, as Is customary, contented them selves with reading the message In Its pamphlet form Instead of listening at tentively to the voice of the clerk. There were some amusing features at tending the reading of the message, espe cially In the senate. Mr. Hanna paid no attention to the clerk, but perused his printed copy as eagerly as If he expected to And some pleasant revelation. He held the message strnlght out in front of his face nnd became apparently absorbed. Then he laid the pamphlet on his desk and leaning over followed the lines with his fore finger. Growing weary he rested his head up on one hand and shadtng his eyes he still followed the words of the printed page with his finger as he read them with absorbing Interest. Then he shifted to the first posture, and so on to the end. The funny part of it all was that Mr. Hanna had been consulted regarding the message before It left the executive man sion nnd there was probably little In the document which had not passed under his eyes before. Irreverent scamps In the gallery suggested that Mr. Hanna was examining the message so closely because he wanted tn see If the presdent had slip ped In anything unbeknown to him. Comment* of Senator*. Senator Foraker grasped the printed copy of the message eagerly and, turn ing to that part relating to foreign af fairs, read It greedily. Then he dropped the copy on his desk and paced around the hall In his customary nervous manner while the clerk droned wearily through the lengthy document. Asked afterward what he thought of the president'* com munication to congress Senator Foraker replied: "It was a very able message and I am pleased wfCh It In Its entirety. I think most all of Its recommendations will be followed by congress." Mr Hanna said: "It Is an able docu ment: forceful and Instructive." These are brief comments made by some of the other senators: Prye, Maine—l think the president's message Is a magnificent one. It touches very Important subjects In a very Intelli gent manner." Spooner, Wlsconsln—l think It Is an nble and exhaustive state paper. It Is written In the felicitous style which char acterizes all of the president's messages. . Beverldge, Indiana—lt Is remarkable for Its comprehensiveness and for the breadth of Its statesmanship. Davis, Mlnnesota—l think the message, In Its entire scope, Is most admirable. Except some little matters of detail con tained In the message It meets with my unqualified approval. Cullom, Illinois—The message contains more and treats of subjects that apper tain to Internationa! affairs of this coun try and our relations with foreign pow ers* better than-any message which has ever emanated from the White House. Burrows. Mlchigan—l regard it as a very clear state paper, covering the en tire ground of domestic and foreign af fairs. I was especially gratified at the financial portion of the document and the attitude taken regarding the treat ment to be extended to our new posses sions. Respecting trusts, I think the president said all he could say In the matter. McComas. Maryland—The message Is strong, patriotic and wise. The subject of trusts Li well treated, and the plan of uniform state legislation, supplemented by Federal statutes, as proposed, is a wise method to restrain such combinations as are dangerous to the public welfare. Galllnger, New Hampshire—l regard this message as one of the most compe tent that ever has been issued. The ques tions are deult with comprehensively, and J think the senate and house will follow its recommendations. Chilton, Texas President McKinley's declaration on the trust question Is vague. I have no doubt that the attitude of the Republican party is likewise Indistinct, so far as the Philippine question is oon cerned. It seems to me the people are en titled to know from the president Just what sort of prospective government the admin istration Intends to inaugurate. He has not made this subject quite clear enough to my satisfaction. (Mr. Chi.ton 1., a Democrat.) Warren, Wyoming—l think the presi dent has made out a policy that will be very valuable to us. and one which will be valuable to the people. Chandller, New Hampshire—lt Is a most admirable message, particularly that por tion referring to the flag In the Phlllp -1 Jones. Arkansas- "The president did not surprise me with hLs trust provision. They are with trusts as they were with bimetal lism. They elected the president on this platform and then repudiated It. So it will be with trusts; condemned for campaign purposes mil keep rlsrht on fostering and maintaining them. (Mr. Jones is chair man of the Democratic national commit tee.) Clark. Wyoming—Covers all subjects ful ly ami well: a great state paper. ' Keene. New Jersey—lt is an excellent document, verv strong, and will commend itself <o the Judgment of the people and will strengthen the administration. Thurston, Nebraska—Strong and able, presenting public nnestlons In a c'ear and concise manner. Places the future of the Philippine Islstids where It probably be longs—with congress. Pritcbard. North Carolina—A very «trong message, especially so on trusts, nri'l will nlace us in a good position before the country. , ' Fairbanks. Indiana—No questions eith er avoided or evaded. Everything is han dled on a lofty and dignified n'ane. and I regard It as one of the strongest messages of »ny president. Clerk. Montana—lt is a strong docu ment. Other senators, as TTawlev. Kentucky; T,odge Massachusetts; TTanshroueh, North Tinkota: Klklns. West Virginia; Kyle. South Dakota; Nelson. Minnesota, agree In commending the message. Senator Depew said; "It Is a st'.ing, able, conservative and statesmanlike mes sa sre." S.-nator Harris of Kansas. Ponullst, crit icises the mfssaee in these words: "It is exceedingly commonplace and rpmarkab'e otilr for its failure to outline a positive policy upon the questions-- in which the people are most interested." Members of the house who are in politi cal svmpathy with the president express substantially the name opinions respecting the message ss those which have been quoted from the senators. Opinions In th«* lloiiir. Representative Orosvenor said: "The message Is a document full of sound sense, pood logic and forceful opinion. Tt is a dear, good and powerful expression of the Republican party'? policy." Representative Cannon said: "The mes sage is a document of weight." Representative Steel of Indiana said: "It Is to my mind unequivocal and sound." AVhat Diplomat* Think. Diplomatic comment on the message Is generally commendatory. The onlv note of discord comes from the Turkish loca tion. The representative* of the Ottoman How to Cure Dyspepsia Stop Doctoring the Symptoms Whloh Aro Indigestion, Flatnleney, Nervousness, Sour Stomach and Gastritis. 

KILL THE GERMS Which Canst the Dlseaae Itelf, and ■II Thcae Will Disappear. THIS IS EASILY DONE. The New Treatment Never Pall* to Care, no Matter How Severe the Caae Mar Be. Now that It has been proven beyond all doubt that food Is not digested In the stomach, only prepared by this organ for digestion In the Intestines; and that dys pepsia Is only caused by a disease germ, the use of digestive ferments to assist digestion may be dispensed with. The same can be said of remedies given to cure Flatulency. Nervousness, Sour Stom ach, Distress after Eating, Biliousness, etc.; these are but the after effect or symptoms of the disease, not the disease Itself, consequently such remedies can only afford temporary relief.

T. empire here were surprised by the presi dent's attitude toward Turkey, and one of them said: "We certainly did not ex pect the president to comment severely upon the relations of Turkey with the United States. It Is of very recent date that the sultan nave a decided token of his friendship for the United States." This diplomat also asserted that, "upon request of the United States government the sultan of Turkey used hla Influence with the sultan of Bulu and materially aid ed In the settling of many questions aris ing out of the transfer of the sovereignty of Spain in the Sulu islands to the United States. We therefore expected from Presi dent McKlnley expressions of gratitude rather than criticism." At the British emhii*ny It was stated that the message was entirely satisfactory to Great Britain, and at the German embassy the general expression was one of entire satisfaction, the diplomats there pointing out that Germany was endeavoring by every means to respond to the growing oordlallty between the two governments.
