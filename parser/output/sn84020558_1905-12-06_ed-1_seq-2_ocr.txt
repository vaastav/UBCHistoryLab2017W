The recommendation of President Roosevent in regard to the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as one state has not come to The Republican as a surprise, though there is an un reasonable bluntness in it which was not expected. This paper has long been aware that the president favored joint statehood, if Indeed he was not the first to suggest it as a solution of the vexing statehood prob lem. Nearly two years ago former dele gate Rodey, of New Mexico, made the public statement that President Rcoseve'.t told htm that he was In favor of . jointure and this statement though repeatedly made was never denied by the presi dent or by any one qualified to speak for him. The question was brought up at a territorial convention held at Tucson for the purpose of selecting delegates to - the republican national convention of 1904. Governor Brodie, a member of the convention de nied that those were the views of the president, and he sent a telegram to him requesting him to support the de nial. That telegram wa3 never an swered. In however high respect the presi dent may be held, his opinions on the subject of statehood will b treated here with no respect at all", nor will his fre quent advocacy of the "square deal" so often reiterated as to have become commonplace, be understood to have any application to Arizona. It cannot be urged by his friends in this part of the world that his recom mendation is the expression of an hon est but mistaken opinion. The presi dent has had the subject laid before him by impartial investigators of con ditions in the territory, by men who had no material interest in Arizona, and they left him with the conclusion that the president had been impressed with the truth of their reports. Be sides, if this information had not been brought to him it might have been presumed that he would have sought the fullest knowledge of conditions before launching that characteristically dictatorial recommendation for the commission of the most flagrant poli tical outrage ever attempted or pro posed in this country. Congress, according to the terms of the recommendation of . President Roosevelt is relieved of the task of de liberation. "There is," says he, "no Justification for further delay and the advisability of making the four ter ritories into two slate3 his been clear ly established. By whom, we may ask? By Bev eridge, whose report was the most dis honestly framed document ever pre sented to congress? By the argu ments of Beveridge, whose remarks on the omnibus bill and the Hamilton bill were characterized by rancor and bit terness toward the territories? All of the many recommendations, save this, one, of the president's , unusually ; vojuml nous message, are followed by reasons more or less prolix, for their making. But no reason is assigned for this one except "Nothing has taken up more time in coigress during the past few years than the question as to the statehood to be granted to the four territories." The reasoning of Mr. Roosevelt is lacking in that enforced justice of the unjust judge, who righted the wrongs of the importunate widow: "Yet be cause this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual com ing she weary me." President RoDsevelt wearied by the importunate appeal of Arizona for the rights of statthood proposes to prevent a repetition of that appeal for all time by the con signment of the territory to perpetual servitude and by blasting the hopes forever of those who for a generation have looked hopefully forward to in dependent statehood. "There are no obligations on us," says Mr. Roosevelt in regard to any claims which the rights of the terri tories may have upon the respect of himself and the congress. That is true, there are no binding constitu tional obligations but there is a cer tain morality which the president, habitual moralizer as he is, has quite overlooked. Since his incumbency he has with a frequency amounting to a habit, been engaging in duties whose performance was not forced upon him by any legal obligation and in none of them have right and justice been more deeply involved than in that neg lected duty of saving this territory from the ruin of jointure or of at least in keeping his hand3 off. We have been authoritatively Inform ed that the president has had no deep Intense Interest in the matter but that before he knew as much of he question as he afterwards learned, he had promised Senator Beveridge his sup port in the coming struggle, and that he admitted that but for that promise he would keep silent. Here is a presen tation of weakness wholly, out of keep ing with the popular conception of President Roosevelt. The president has never entertained a sincere friendship for the west. He has patted it on the back and led it into confounding pat ronizing familiarity with friendly Inter est. The mental attitude of Mr. Roose velt toward the population of the west is hardly less contemptuous than that of former President Cleveland and is well illustrated by the following ex tract from a recent letter by Mr. W. E. Curtis: "Arizona is the range of the Rough Rider and the people of the territory are complaining that they are 'rough ridden.' Going into the president's of fice one day last winter, I found Maj or Llewellyn of the first volunteers, seated on a sofa. When I asked what he was doing in Washington he ex plained that he had come to arrange an escort of Rough Riders for the president on inaugural day. " 'Are you going to have all the reg iment here?" I asked. "The president who stood five or six feet away, talking with another caller, must have overheard our remarks, for he turned and, showing his teeth, whispered: " 'All who are not In office or in jail." n There is nothing to be expected from an appeal to President Roose velt's sense of justice In this matter. The whole reliance of Arizona must be placed upon congress. The battle is by no means lost. President Roose velt's recommendations have been fre quently ignored. We trust that this one will be disregarded. 

WHERE LIES THE LAND? ANOTHER PEACE CONFERENCE. (Wallace Irwin in Collier's.) "Come here, come here, football play ers. Ye coaches wild and tough! Why do ye slug and gouge and chug And raise a house so rough?" So up spake King Theodore In something more than bluff. The football cpaches up have come And stood them in a row With blushing cheek, and nought they speak Except, to mutter low, "O mighty one, the thing we done We done in wrath, we know!" Then loud doth roar King Theodore A-klcking up his feet, "To snarl and fight and gouge and bite Is neither meet nor meat To strew the field with vertebrae, Is this an act discreet? "Ye call it feetball that ye play. Yet this hath no avail How can ye play the ball of feet With fist and tooth and nail?" (Thrice triply groan the dour coach es, .Their blushing cheeks grown pale.) t " 'Tis my command: ye must not play With teeth and nails and fists; In evening clo'es and varnished shoes Go ye upon the lists Taste not the (oeman in the eye. But slap htm on the wrists. "Let football never be so rough - As soil a tie of lawn. As spoil the crease upon your knees Or smear your gloves of fawn Be gentle, or I'll wring your necks! Avaunt, re mutts! Begone! !" So forth they fare, and Theodore Sittith his throne so high. A Colt's revolver in hts boots, A stab-knife at his thigh, And with the sheath he picks his teeth And slgheth a kingly sigh. Where lies the land to which the ship would go? Far, far ahead, Is all Tier seamen know. And where .the land she travels from? Away, Far, far behind, is all that they can say. On sunny moons upon' the deck's smooth face. Linked arm in arm, how pleasant here to pace, Or, o'er the stern reclining, watch be low The foaming wake, far widening as we go. On stormy nights, when wild north westers rave, How proud a thing to fight with wind and wave, The dripping sailor on the reeling mast. Exults to bear, and scorns to wist it past. Where lies the land to which the ship would go? Far, far ahead, is all her seamen know. And where the land she travels from? Away, Far, far behind, it all that they can say.
