The following touching lines were sent home for preservation, by one of our soldiers who fell in the first day's battle of the Wilderness: On guard to night? 'Tis a lonely place, And for two long hours I must wearily pace To and fro 'mid the tall old pines, | Fringed with moss and clinging with vines. Scarce smiles a star through the clouds aloft, And the ocean breeze is damp and soft That fans my fevered cheek and brow While I think of home and the loved ones now. Omguard to-night 1 'Tis a lonely beat, And with heavy heart and weary feet, Amid the dark and gloom I tread— For I'm watching o'er the unburied dead. Ah, yester morn how lightly throbbed Full many a heart that death hath robbed Of its pulses warm; and the caskets lie As cold as the winter's starless sky. How sad the thought that another day Will bring again the battle's fray— And ere tbe close of the morrow's light I too may sleep like those to-night Past mid-night hour, and I try to hear A step to the soldier's heart most dear— A sound that banishes all of liis grief— The welcome tread of the next relief. Ah here they come 1 And I can keep My next four hoars in the land of sleep. And dream of home and the loved ones there Who may never know a soldier's care. Camp on the Potomac, near Belle Plain, Va., March 25, 1864. PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE, Delivered December 6, 1864. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representa tives : Again the blessings of health and abundant harvests claim our profoundest gratitude to Almighty God. The condition of our foreign affairs a reasonably ' satisfactory. Mexico continues to be a theatre of civ il war; while our politcal relations with that country ; have undergone no change, we have at the same time strictly maintained neutrality between the belligerents. " At the request of the States of Costa Rica and N'ica t raugna, a competent engineer has been authorized to „ make a survey of the river San Juan and the port of San Juan. ' It is a source of much satisfaction that the difficul ties which at one moment excited some political ap prehensions and caused a closing of the inner Ocean ic trunsit route, have been amicably adjusted, and that there is a good prospect that the route will soon be re-opened with an increase of capacity and adapta tion. We could not exaggerate either "the commer cial or the political importance of that great improve ment. The new liberal constitution of Venezuela having 0 gone into effect with the universal acquiescence of the people, the government under it has been recog nized, and diplomatic intercourse with it has opened in a cordial and friendly spirit. The long deferred Aux Island claim has been satisfactorily paid and dis charged. Mutual payments have been made of the claims awarded by the late joint committee for the settlement of claims between the United States and Peru. An earnest and cordial friendship continues to ex ist between the two countries, and such efforts as were in my power have been used to remove misun derstanding and avert a threatened war between Peru and Spain. Our relations are of the most friendly nature with 1 Chili, the Argentine Republic, Bolivia. Costa Kica, Par ' aguay, San Salvador and Hayti. During the past year no differences of any kind have arisen with aiiy of those Republics, and on the other hand, their sympa thies with the United States are constantly expressed with cordiality and earnestness. It wouid he doing injustice to an important South American State not to acknowledge the directness, frankness and cordiality with which the United States of Columbia have entered into intimate relations with this Government. A claims convention has been con stituted to complete the unfinished work of the one which closed its session in 1861. The claim arising from the seizure of the cargo of the brig Macaomau. in 1821, lias been paid in full by the government of Chili. Civil war coniiuues in the Spanish part of San Do mingo, apparently without prospect of an early close. Otticial correspondence has been freely opened with Liberia, and it gives us a pleasing view of social and political progress in that Republic. It may be expect ed to derive new vigor from American influence, un- B roved by the rapid disappearance of slavery in the uited States. I solicit your authority to furnish to the republic a gunboat at moderate cost, to be .reimbursed to the United States by instalments. Such a vessel is need ed for the safety" of that State against the native African races, and in Liberian hands it wouid lie more effect ive in arresting the African slave trade than a squad ron in our hands. The possession of the least organ ized naval force would stimulate a generous ambition in the repubic, and the confidence which we would manifest bv furnishing it, would win forbearance and favor towards the colony from all civilized nations. The proposed overland telegraph between America and Europe, bv the way of Benring's Straits and Asi atic Russia, which was sanctioned by Congress at the last session, has been undertaken under very favora ble cireumstaaees by an association of American citi zens, with the cordial good will and support as well of the Government as those of Great Britain and Russia. Assurances have been received from most of the South Atnerican States of their appreciation of the enterprise, and their readiness to co-orerate in con structing lines tributary to tftat world-encircling com munication. I learn with much satisfaction that the noble design of a telegraphic communication be tween the eastern coast of America and Great Britain has lieen renewed, with full expectation of its early accomplishment. Thus it is hoped that with the re turn of domestic peace, the country will be able to resume with energy and advantage its former high career ol commerce and civilization. Our very popular and estimable representative in Bgypt died in April last. An unpleasant altercation which arose between the temporary iucumbentof the ottice and the Government of the Pacha resulted in a suspension of intercourse. The evil was promptly corrected on the arrival of the succersor in the Con sulate, and our relations with Egypt, as well as our re lations with the Barbary Powers, are entirely satisfac tory. The rebellion which hae so long been fla-'rant in China has at last been suppressed under the co-op [ erating good offices of this Government and the other Western Commercial States. The -Judicial Consular establishment has become very difficult and onerous, and it will need legislative revision to adapt it to the extension of our commerce, and to the more intimate intercourse which has been instituted with the Government and people of that vast Empire. China seems to be accepting with hear ty good will the conventional laws which regulatecoin inercial and social intercourse among the Western nations. Owing to the peculiar situation of Japan, and the anomalous form of its government, the action of that Empire in performing treaty stipulations is inconstant I and capricious. Nevertheless good progress lias heeu effected by the Western Powers moving with enlight i eued"concert. Our own pecuniary claims have been allowed and put in course of settlement, and the in land sea has been reopened to commerce. There is reason also to believe tnat these proceedings have in creased rather than diminished the friendship of Ja prd towards the United States. The ports of Norfolk. Feruandtna and Pensacola have been opened by proclamation. It is hoped that foreign merchants will now consider whether it is not safer and more profitable to themselves, as well as just to the United States, to resort to these and other 1 open ports, titan it is to pursue through many hazards and at vast cost a contraband trade with other ports which are closed, if not by actual military occupation, at least by a lawful and efiecuve blockade. For myself, I have uo doubt of the power and duty of the Executive, under the law of nations, to exclude enemies of the human race from an asylum in the Fuited Stales. If Congress shall think that proceed ings in such cases lack the authority of law, or ought to be further regu'utsd by it, 1 recommend that pro visions be made for effectually preventing foreign slave traders from acquiring domicil and facilities for their criminal occupation in our country. It is possible that if it were a new and open ques tion, the maritime powers, with the rights they now enjoy, would not concede the privileges of a naval bel ligerent to the insurgents of the United States, desti tute as they are, and always have been, equally of ships of war and of ports and harbors. 

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1864. Disloyal emissaries have been neither less assidu- ' ous nor more successful during the last year than they were before that time in their efforts, under favor of that privilege, to embroil our country in foreign j wars. Ihe desire and determination of the govern ment of the Maritime States to defeat that design are believed to be as sincere as and cannot be more earn- j est than our own. Nevertheless unforseen political j difficulties have arisen, especially in Brazilian and j British ports, and on the northern boundary of the ' United States, which have required and are likely to continue to require the practice of constant vigilance and a just and conciliatory spirit on the part of the I United States, as well as of the nations concerned ; and their governments. Commissioners have been appointed under the treaty of Great Britain on the adjustment of the claims : of the Hudson Bay and Puget Sound Agricultural j Companies in Oregon, and are now proceeding to the : trust assigned to them. In view of the insecurity of 1 life and property in the region adjacent to the Cana dian border by reason of recent assaults and depre- ! dations committed by inimical and desperate persons who are harbored there, it has been thought proper to give notice that after the expiration of six months, i the period conditionally stipulated under the existing i arrangement with Great Britain, the United States , must hold themselves at liberty to increase their na val armament on the Lakes, if they shall find that ; proceeding necessary. The condition of the border will necessarily come into consideration ineonneetiou with the question of limiting or modifying the rights j of transit from Canada through the United States, as well as the regulation of imposts, which were tempo rarily established by the reciprocity treaty of the sth June, 1864. I desire, however, to be understood, while : making this statement, that the Colonial authorities of Canada are not deemed to be intentionally unjust or unfriendly towards the United States; but on the contrary, there is every reason to expect that, with the approval of Her Majesty's Government, they will J take the necessary measures to prevent new incur sions lo cross the borders. The act passed at the last session for the encourage ment of emigration has, so far as was possible, been put into operation. It seems to need amendment, which will enable the officers of the government to prevent the practice of frauds against the emigrants on their way and on their arrival in the ports, so as to secure them here, a free choice of avocations and places of settlement. A liberal disposition towards this great National poli cy is manifested by most of the European States, and ought to be, especially on our part, of giving the em igrants effective national protection. I regard our emigrants as one of the principal replenishing streams which are appointed by Providence to repair the lavages of internal war. and its wastes of national health and strength. All that is necessary to secure the flow of that stream in its present fulness, and to that end the Government must everywhere make it manifest, that it neither needs nor designs to impose involuntary military service upon those who come .'i 1 lands to cast their lot in our country. 1 he financial affairs of the Government have been successfully administered. During tfie last year the legislation of the last ses sion ot Congress has beneficially effected the revenue, although sufficient time has not yet elapsed to expe rience the fni! effect of several of the provisions of t 'ie A | 'ts of Congress imposing increased taxation. lhe receipts during the year from all sources upon the basis of warrants signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, including loans, and the balance in the Treasury on the Ist day of July 1863, were $1,394,796,- ot>7 62. and the aggregate disbursements upon the same basis were $1,298,656,101 89. leaving a balance in the Treasury, as shown by warrants, of $96,734,905 73. Deduct from these amounts the amounts of the prin cipal of the public debt redeemed and the amount of issues in substitution therefor, and the actual cash op erations of the Treasury were : Receipts $884,076,646 57; disbursement* $865,234,087- 86, which leaves as the cash balance in the Treasury $18,842,558 71. Of the receipts there were derived from customs $102,316,152 99 From lands. $588,332 29; lrom direct taxes. $475,648 96; frotn internal revenue, . $109,741,134 10; from miscellaneous sources, $47,511.- 448 10, and from loans,applied toactual expenditures including former balances. $623,443,929 13. There were disbursed for the civil service, $275,058,994 46; for pensions and Indians, $7.517,930 67; for the War Department. $690,791,842 97; for the Navy Department. $75,833,291 77: for interest on the public debt, $53,685,- 421 68, making an aggregate of $865,234,087 86. and leaving a balance in tne Treasury of $18,842,558 71, as before stated. For the actual receipts and disbursements from the first quarter. aßd the estimated receipts ami disburse- | ments for the three remaining quarters of the current fiscal year, and tlte general operations of the Treasu ry in detail. I refer you to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, f concur with him in the opinion j that the proportion of moneys required to meet the expenses consequent upon the war, derived from tax- i ation. should be still further increased, and 1 earnest ly invite your attention to this subject to the end that there may be such additional legislation as shall be ! required to meet the just expectations of the Secre- i turv. The public debt on the first day of July last, as ap- : pears by the books of the Secretary of the Treasury. ! amounted to one billion, seven hundred and forty j thousand millions, six hundred and ninety thousand, i four hundred and eighty-nine dollars and forty-nine ' cents. Probably, should the war continue for another year, that amount may be increased by not far from five hundred millions. Held as it is for*the most part by our own people, it has become a substantial branch j of national though private property. For obvious 1 reasons, the more nearly this property can be distrib- i uted among all the people the better. To tavor such a general distribution, greater in- 1 ducements to become owners might perhaps, with i good effect and without injury, be presenter! to per- j sous of limited means. With this view, I suggest ! whether it might not be both competent and expedi- j ent for Congress to provide that a limited amount of j some future issue ol'public securities might be held ; by any bona tide purchaser exempt from taxation and ! for seizure for debt, under such restrictions and limi- j tntions as might be necessary to guard against abuse j of so important a privilege, fnis would enable every i prudent person to set aside a small annuity against a possible day of want. Privileges like these would i render the possession of such securities, to the i amount limited, most desirable to every person of j small means who might be able to have enough for ' the purpose. The Secretary reiterates his recommendations, and ! to them the attention of Congress is invited. The liberal provisions made by Congress for paying pensions to invalid soldiers and sailors of the Repub- ; fic, and to the widows, orphans and dependent moth- ! crs of those who have fallen in battle, or died of dis- | eases contracted, or wounds received in the service of the country, have been dilligently administered. The great advantage of citizens being creditors as well as debtors with relation to the public debt is obvious. Men readily perceive that they cannot be much oppressed by a debt which they owe to them selves. The public debt on the first day of Jul v last, although somewhat exceeding the estimate of the Secretary of the Treasury made to Congress at the commence ment of the last session, falls short of the estimateof that officer made in the preceding December, as to its probable amount at the beginning of this year by a sum of $3,995,097 31. This fact exhibits a satisfactory condition and conduct of the operations of the Trea sury. The National banking system is proving to be ac ceptable to capitalists and to the people. Oil the 25th day of November 584 National Banks had been organ ized. a considerable number of which were conver sions from State Banks. Changes from State systems to the National system arc rapidly taking place, and it is hoped that very soon there will be in the United States no banks of issue not authorized by Congress, and no note circulation not secured by the Govern ment. 1 hat the Government and the people will de rive great benefit from this change m the banking system of the country cau hardly be questioned. The National system will create a permanent and reliable influence in support of the National credit, and pro tect the people against losses in the use of paper inonev. r Whether or not any further legislation is advisable lor the suppression of State bank issues, it will be for Congress to determine. It seems to be quite clear that the Treasury cannot be satisfactorily conducted unless the Government can exercise a restraining power over the bank circulation of the countrv. The report of the Secretary of War and the'accom panytng documents will detail the campaign of the Armies in the field, since the date of the last annual message, and also the operations of the several ad ministrative bureaus of the War Department during the last year. It will also specify the measures deem ed necessary tor the national defence, and to keep up and supply the requisite military force. The report of the Secretary ol the Navy presents a comprehensive and satisfactory exhibit of the officeis of that Department and of the naval service. It is a subject of congratulation and laudable pride to our countrymen that a Navy of such vast propor tions has been organized in so brief a period and con ducted with so much efficiency and success. The general exhibit of the Navy, including vessels under contract on the Ist of Deceml>er, 1864, shows a total exhibit of six hundred and seveuty-one vessels, car rying four thousand six hundred and ten guns, and of 510,396 tons, being an actual increase during the year, over and above all losses by shipment or in battle, of 83 vessels, 167 guns and 4,247 tons. The total number of men at this time in the naval service, including officers, is about fifty-one thousand. There have been captured by the Navy during the year, three hundred and twenty-four vessels, and the whole number of naval captures since hostilities com menced. is thirteen hundred and seventy-nine, of which two hundred and sixty-seven are steamers. — * ne gross proceeds arising from the sale of condeinn- P/' z . e , property thus far reported, amount to $14.- 396.-50 51. A large amount of such proceeds is still under adjudication and yet to be reported. The total | expenditure of the Naval Department, of every de seription, including the cost oi the immense squad rons that have been called into existence since the 1 fourth day ol March, 1860, to the first of November, 1864, is $238,647,262 35. I 1 our favorable consideration is invited to the va rious recommendations of the Secretary of the Navv, I especially in regard to a navy yard and suitable estab- ' lishinent for the construction and repair of iron ves- j sels, and the machinery and armature for our ships to i wbieh reference is made in my last annual message, j ] lour attention is also invited to the views expressed : < in the report in relation to the legislation of Congress ; I at its last session in respect to prizes on inland waters. < 1 cordially concur in the recommendation of the Sec- ! retary as to the propriety of creating the new rank of i i > ice Admiral in our naval service. Your attention is j i invited to the report of the Postmaster General for a I i detailed account of the operation and financial condi- j tion of the Post Office Department. The postal re- i 1 sources for the year ending June 30, 1864. amounts to ] f l2 ' 43 *- 253 a "'l the expenditures to $12,644,786 20. j < The excess of expenditures over receipts being ! i $20*5,532 -12. 1 The views presented by the Postmaster General on ' the sunieet of special grants bv the government, in ' aid of the establishment of new lines of ocean mail steamships and the policy he recommends for the de- I ' velopement of increased commercial intercourse with ! I adjacent and neighboring countries should receive ! ' tbe careful consideration of Congress. It is ot note- I ' worthy interest that the steady expansion of popula- ' * tion. improvement and governmental institutions over ! : the new and unoccupied portions of our country have i 1 scarcely been checked, much less impeded "or de stroyed by our great civil war, which, at first glance, I would seem to have absorbed almost the entire ener- I gies of the nation. The organization and admission j of the State of Nevada has been completed m confor- ! i mity with law, and thus our excellent svstem is firmlv 1 : established in the mountains which were once deem ed a barren and uninhabitable waste between the At lantic States and those which have grown up on the roast of the Pacific ocean. The territories of the Union are generally in a condition of prosperity and j rapid growth. Idaho and Monutana. by reason of j their great distance and the interruption of commu- j < nicatiou wtth them by Indian hostilities, have been only partially organized. But it is understood these ' difficulties are about to disappear, which will permit their governments, like those of the others, to go into speedy and full operation, as intimated and connected with and promotive of this material growth of the nation. I ask the attention of Congress to the valuable in formation and important recommendations relative to the public lands, Indian affairs, the Pacific railroad and mineral discoveries contained in tbe report of the Secretary of the Interior, which is herewith transmit ted. and which report also embraces tiie subjects of patents, pensions and other topics of public interest pertaining to his Department. The quantity of pub lic. land disposed of during the five quarters ending 30th December last, was 4.221.342 acres, of which 1,- 638,614 acres were entered under the Homestead law. The remainder was located with military land war rants. agricultural scrip, certified to States for railroads and sold for cash. The cash received from sales and location fees was $1,016,466. and the income froin sales during the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1864, $678.007 21, against 8130,077 95 received during the preceding year. The aggregate number of acres surveyed during tbe year, has been equal to the quanity disposed of, and there is open to settlement about 133.000.000 acres of surveyed laud. The great enterprise of connecting I the Atlantic with the Pacific States by railways and telegraph lines, has been entered upon with a vigor which gives assurance of success. Notwithstanding the embarrassment arising from the prevailing high prices of materials and laDor. the route of the main tine of the road has been definitely located for one hundred miles westward from the initial point at Oma ha city, Nebraska, and a preliminary location of the Pacific railroad of California has been made from Sac ramento to the great bend of the Trace river, iu Ne vada. Numerous discoveries of gold and silver, and simi lar mines have been added to the many already known, and the country occupied by the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains, and the suburban ranges, now teem with enterprising labor, which is richly remunerative. It is believed that the product of the mines of miner als in that region lias already reached, if not exceed ed. one hundred millions in value. It was recommended in my last annual message that our Indian system be remodelled. Congress, at its last session, acting upon the recommendation, did provide for a reorganization of the system in Califor nia, and it is believed that under the "present organiza tion tbe management of the Indians there will be at tended with considerable success. Much remains to he done to provide for the proper management of the Indians in other parts of tbe country to render it se cure for the advancing settler, and to provide for the welfare of the Indian. There has been added to the pension rolls during the year ending the 30th day of June last, the natnes of 16.770 invalid soldiers, and of 271 disabled seamen, making the present number of army invalid pension ers 22.767. aud of navy invalid pensioners 7,121. Of widows, orphans and mothers. 22.19$ have been placed on the army pension rolls, and 248 on the navy rolls. The present number of army pensioners of this class is 25.433. and of navy pensioners, 793. At the begin ning of the year the number of revolutionary pen sioners were 1,4(40. Only twelve of them were sol diers, of whom seven have since died. The remain der are those who, under the laws, receive pensions because of relationship to revolutionary soldiers. Du ring the year ending the 30th of June, 1864. $4;504,616 92 have been paid to pensioners of all classes. I cheerfully commend to your continued patronage the benevole'nt institutions of the District of Colum bia, which have hitherto been fostered by Congress, and respectfully refer for information concerning them and in relation to the Washington Acqueduct, the Capitol aud other matters of locafinterest, to the report of the Secretary of the Interior. The Agricultural Department, under the supervision | of its present energetic and faithful head, is rapidly j commending itself to the great and vital interest it | was created to advance. It is particularly the depart ; ment in which the people feel more directly concern ed than in any other. I commend it to the continued I attention and fostering care of Congress. The War continues." Since the last annual message I all the important lines and positions then occupied by our forces have been maintained, and our armies have 1 steadily advanced, thus liberating the region left in j the rear, so that Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee and i parts of other States have again produced reasonably | fair crops. j The most remarkable feature in the military opera i Hons of the year ia General Sherman's attempted : march of three hundred miles directly through the j insurgent region. It tends toshowagreatinerea.se i of our relative strength that our General-in-Chief I should teel able to confront and hold in check every i active force of the enemy, and yet to detail a well ap ; pointed large army to move on such an expedition.— The result not yet being known, conjecture In regard | to it is not here" indulged. Independent movements have also occurred during the year to the effect of modelling society fordurabil j ity in the Union. "Although it is much in the right direction that i twelve thousand citizens in each of the States of Ar kansas and Louisiana have organized loyal State gov ernments, with free constitutions, and are earnestly struggling to maintain and administer them, the inove ; merits in the same directions, more extensive though I less definite, in Missouri. Kentucky and Tennessee, ; should not be overlooked. But Maryland presents the example of complete success. Maryland is secure to Liberty and the L nion I for all the future. The genius of rebellion will no more claim Maryland. Like another foul spirit, being i driven out, it tnay seek to tear her, but it will woo her : no mote. j At the last session of Congress a proposed amend i ment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery tbrough ! out the United States, passed the Senate, but failed for lack of thd-requisite two-thirds vote in the House of Representatives. Although the present is the same Congress and nearly the same members, and without questioning the wisdom or patriotism of those who stood iu opposition, I venture to recommend the re consideration and passage of the measure at the pres ent session. Of course the abstract question is not changed, but an intervening election shows almost certainly that the next Congress will pass the measure, if tins one does not; hence it is only a question of time when the proposed amendment will go to the States for their ; action, and as it is to go at all events, may we not j agree the sooner the better. It isuotclaimeathatthe ; election has imposed a duty on members to change j their views or their votes, any further than as au ad -1 ditional element to be considered now far their judg- I ment may be effected by it. It is the voice of the peo- I pie for the first time heard upon the question. ; In a great national crisis like ours unanimity ofac ! tion among those seek lug a common end is very de ! su able, almost indispensable, and yet no approach to each unanimity is attainable unless some deference shall be paid to the will of the majority, simply be cause it ts the will of the majority. In this case the common end is the maintenance of the Union, and among the means to secure that end such will, through the election, is most clearly declared in favor of such constitutional amendment. The most reliable indica Eaffi'WaSffffi'WSJs, ECEfffIkESJ tion of public purpose in this country is derived through our popular elections. Judging by the re cent canvass and its results, the purpose of tbe people \vitliiu the lova! States to maintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unani mous than now. The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls, give strong assurance of this. Not only all those who supported the Uuion ticket, so CRiled. out a great majority of the opposing party al so, may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actu ated by the same purpose. It is an unanswerable argument to this effect, that no candidate for any office whatever, high or low, has ventured tc seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union. There has been much impugn ing of motives, and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Uuion cause, but on the distinct issue of Union or no Union, the politicians have shown their iustinetive knowl edge that there is no diversity among the people. In affording the people the"iairopportunity of show ing one to another and to the world the fairness and unanimity of purpose, the election has been of vast importance to the national cause. The election has exhibited another fact not less valuable to be known. Tbe fact that we do not ap proach exhaustion m the most important branch of our national resources—that of having inen! —while it is melancholy to reflect that the war has filled so many graves, and carried mourning to so many heart*, it is some relief to know that, compared with the sur viving, the fallen have been so few. When corps, and divisions, and brigades and regi ments have formed and fought, anu dwindled and gone out of existence, a great majority of the men who composed them are still living. The same is true of the naval service. The electiou returns prove this. So many voters could not be fouud. The States regularly holding elections, both now and four years ago, to "wit: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illi nois, Indiana, lowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland. Massachusetts, Michigan. Minnesota. Missouri. New Hampshire. New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania. Rhode Island. Vermont, West Virginia and Wisconsin, cast 3.952.9U votes now. agaiust 3,870,- 222 east then, showing an aggregate now 3,982,011. To this is to be added 33,762, east now in the new States of Kansas and Nevada, which States did not vote in 1800, thus swelling the aggregate 4.015,773, and the nett increase during the three years and a half of the war to 145,651. A table is appended showing particu lars. To this again should be added the number of ail soldiers in the field from Massachusetts, Rhode Islaud, New Jersey, Delaware Indiana. Illinois and California, who, by the laws of those States, could not vote away from their homes, and which number can not be less than 90.000. Nor yet is this all: the number in organized territories is triple now what it was four years ago. while thousands, white and black, join us as the National arms press back the insurgent lines. So much is shown affirmatively and negatively of the election. It is not material to inquire how the increase has been produced, or to show that it would have been greater for the war, which is probably true. The im portant fact remains demonstrated, wo have more men now t4ian when we began; we are not exhausted or in process of exhaustion; that we are gaining strength, and may, if need be, maintain the contest indefinitely, and thai as to men our material resour ces are now more complete and abundant than ever. The National resources, then, are unexhausted, and as we believe, inexhaustable. The public purpose to re-establish and maintain the National authorities is unchanged, and we believe.unchangeable. Thetnun ner of continuing the effort remains to choice. On careful consideration of ali the evidence accessible, it seems to me that no amicable negotiation with the insurgent leaders would result in any good. lie would accept nothing short of a severance of the Un ion. precisely what we cannot and will not give. His declarations to this effect are explicit and oft repeated. He does not attempt to deceive us, he af fords no excuse to deceive ourselves. We eauuot voluntarily yield the Union, and we will not yield. Between him and us the issue is distinct and simple, and inflexible. It is an issue which can only be tried by war and decided by victory. If we yield we are beaten. " If the Southern people fail him, he is beaten. Either wav. it would be the victory and defeat following war. ti'hat is true, bow ever, of him who heads the insurgent cause, is not necessarily true of those who follow. Although he cannot re-aeeept the Union they can. Some of them, we know, already desire peace and Union. The. number of such may increase. They can at any moment have peace simply by lay ing down their arms and submitting to ti.e National authority under the Constitution. After so much the Government could not, if it would, maintain war against them. Loyal people would not sustain or allow it. If ques tions should remain, we would adjust them by the peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts and votes, operating only in constitutional and lawful channels. Some certain and other possible questions are aud would be beyond the Executive power to ad just; as. for instance, the admissiou of members into Congress, and whatever might require the appropria tion of money. The Executive power itself wou'd lie greatly diminished by the cessation of actual war. Pardons and remissions of forfeitures, however, would still be within the Executive control. In what spirit and temper this control would be exercised, can be fairly judged by the past. A year ago a general pardon and amnesty, upon spe cific terms. were offered to all except certain desig nated classes; it was at the same time made known that the excepted classes were still within contempla tion of special clemency.' During the year many availed themselves of the general provision, and ma ny more would, only that the signs of bad faith in some led to such precautionary measures as rendered the practical procem less certain and easy. During the same time also, certain pardons have been granted to individuals of tbe excepted classes, and no voluntary application has been denied. Thus practically the door has been for a full year open to all except such as were not in condition to make free choice—that is. such as were in custody or under restraint. It is so still, open to all. But the time may come, probably will come, when public duty shall demand that it be closed, and that in lieu, more vigorous measures than heretofore be adopted. In presenting the abandonment of armed resistance to the national authority on the part of the insurgents as the only indispensable condition to the ending of the war on "the part of the Government, 1 retract noth ing heretofore said as to slavery. 1 repeat the decla ration made a year ago. that" while I remain in my present positiou, I shall not attempt to retract or mod ify the emancipation proclamation; nor shall 1 return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation, or by any act of Congress. If the people should! by whatever mode or means, make it an Executive duty to re-enslave such persons another and not 1 mast be their instrument to perform it. In stating a siugle condition of peace 1 mean simply to say that the war will cease on the part of the Gov ernment whenever it shall have ceased on the part of those who began it. (Signed)

Analysis of the Massachusetts State Assayer, January '25, 1858. When evaporated through clean linen it left no oil or offensive matter. In every res pect it is a PURE spirituous liquor. The oil which gives to this Brandy its flavor and aro ma, is wholly unlike fusil, or grain oil. Its odor partakes of both the fruit and oil of grapes With acids, it produces ethers of a high fragrance. The substitution of this Brandy lor Cognac Brandy will do away with the manufacture of fctilious spirits, sold un der this name both at home aud abroad. Respectfully, A. A. Ilayes. M D., Assayer to State Mass., 16, Boyleston St. By the same, in 1864. I have analyzed " L. Lyons' Pure Catawba Brandy," with reference to its composition and character, being the same as that pro duced in past years. A sample taken from ten casks afforded the same results with re gard to purity; a slightly increased amount of the principle on which its flavor depends was determined by comparison with former samples. The indications of analysis show that this Brandy is produced by the same process as most of the imported Brandy. Respecfully, A. A. HAYES M. D.
