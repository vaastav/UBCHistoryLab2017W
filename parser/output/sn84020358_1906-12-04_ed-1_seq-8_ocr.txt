NEW HAVEN MORNING JOtKNAL AND COURIER. TUESDAY DECEMBER 4 19uu CLOSING SCENES ARE BITTER (Continued from First Page.) thoUe five doctors, reputable men of Herkimer county, and your friends who enter your homes perhaps every day, are Hars and burglars, he says that which is not true. He doesn't ex pect by that address to reach the in telligent men on this jury. He thinks that there may be a rogue among you. Tou know some times men get on jur ied who have debts of gratitude to pay from away back years ago and they pay them by violating the rules and rendering a verdict not in accordance with the evidence. That is what is called a rogue of a jury, and he hoped there might be a rogue among you. Then they also seek to get a weak and unintelligent man on the Jury who wont be able to put an act in one town with an act in another town and so connect the evidence. They hope there might be a man of this kind in this Jury and they would try to reach him and thua effect a miscarriage of jus tice." In this strain, so excited at timels that the big audience fairly gasped, Mr. Ward brought to a spectacular close a day of steady speech malting with here and there a dramatic periud. Senator Mills contended that Grace Brown committed suicide and that his client had been unfairly dealt with. Gillette had, he said, been pitted .against the united powers of a persist ent district attorneySs department, an unscrupulous sheriff's department and 'a biased and unfair public press. The district attorney had failed to 1,-how any plausible motive for the terrible murder laid at Gillette's duor; he had failed to produce the eye witness he was expected to produce on the strungth of his opening address and he' failed to prove that Gillette had any sweetheart other than Grace Brown, as he promised to do. Mr. Mills declared that every bit of evidence introduced by the district at torney wan overdrawn and that noth ing authentic had been presented to the Jury that was consistent with the course a young man and a young woman in similar trouble would have taken in seeking relief and secrecy to shield their reputations. He said the district attorney might as well have said that Grace Brown was utruek by a ibushel basket, as with a frail tennis racquet and that the girl's head had struck the keel of the overturning 'boat as she went overboard, if there were such Injuries as the doctors had sworn to. Mr. Mills averred that IGrace 'Brown followed the wish writ ten by her in'one of the letters to Gil lette that she drowned herself hoping to be 'burled with her secret unknown by the mother whose love and respect she valued more than her own life. He ctosed with the attack on the phy sicians, whom he claimed distorted the report of their autopsy, that brought the district attorney to his feet. After declaring that counsel for the defense had sought to find a rogue dn tno jury, Mr. Ward continued: 1 hey say this young man should have been represented at that autopsy, How could he be represented when the officers were in the Adirondacks look ing for him at the time the autopsy as performed? The district attorney - himself was not there. And then be cause he was not represented Mr. Mills attempts to discredit the word of the five reputable doctors brought here, and he attempts to make a doctor of himself. He makes himself out a doc tor and tries to tell you what consti tutes drowning. He (this 'doctor') says he has studied nights and learned med icine in the past five weeks. Why, igentlemen, he couldn't learn as much about anatomy this man who never saw a lung In his life by reading nights as these doctors could learn of law by reading his books nights. "Why weren't they represented? Why, gentlemen, nobody knew but what the girl had been drowned until they found that wound under the hair and followed It to the brain. And when they found that blood-clot they knew in a minute what caused her death it was a blow on the head. "There was nothing In this post mortem to mislead or deceive anybody, and it revealed the fact that murder had been committed; that the girl had not died from drowning; that no water entered into the mouth; that no water entered into the lungs; the lungs were normal and natural. "Who does the counsel want to reach when he speaks of the doctors' testi mony? He had a learned doctor who sat by him there; it would have been competent for him to have put that doctor on the stand and sworn to things Mr. Mills testified to in summing up. He wasn't under oath. Mr. Mills told you what constitutes drowning. He would bear evidence to that, but he wasn't himself sworn. He knew if that doctor got on the stand he would tes tify as the other doctors, but Instead of taking that course he says, 'I will get up before that jury and will testify that all the other doctors are wrong.' Wasn't that nonsense? "Now, what insidious thing did he mean when he told you about graft that existed? Was there any graft when that poor girl was brought up into the woods to be murdered? Did graft cause that? What did he mean? "I charge here and now Hint that lit tle falsehood was put into the case for the purpose of prejudicing a poor, fool ish juror and to keep him from giving proper consideration to the evidence in the oase. "Then he made a great splurge on those medical notes. It was amusing to hear him say, 'I haven't got the orig inal notes.' No, of course not; there were five" doctors and only one set ot original notes, and each of them could not have it. POOR EYESIGHT may come from the use of cof fee. Before getting glasses, quit coffee and use well-made POSTU "There's a Reason" "A doctor went to a stenographer. Where there were matters that he re garded as immaterial he left them out and sent each of the physicians a copy. He (Mills) would say, 'Was there some thing left out?' 'Yes.' ' 'Was it left out on purpose?' 'Yes.' He wouldn't ask these doctors what it was. 'Now, just to contradict one state ment he has made. These doctors all agreed that the girl didn't drown. When the doctors found where that blow had been made, and found what the condition of the lungs were, they needed to seek no further for the cause of death. "This learned doctor says, 'No, it was caused by drowning.' He finds differ ently than those other five doctors, but it Isn't under oath. He says those doc tors get pay from the county. So does he, so do I, so do all the judges. There was the ruptured blood vessel, the scalp shows discoloration, the skull was open. He thought he could make peo ple believe because they didn't call it a clot, because they called it ecchymoses, that therefore they had done something wrong. "I want you to decide this case on the evidence. That means the sworn evi dence, and not this misquoted and fal sified evidence as you heard it from the learned counsel. You are sworn to take the evidence of these physicians." At this point the prosecutor stopped abruptly and court adjourned until to morrow, when the district attorney will resume his argument, occupying the forenoon session. It is expected that the case will go to the jury to-morrow afternoon. ATTORNEY CUMMINGS RETURNS. Attorney Alexander Cummings has returned after several days' visit with friends in Springfield, Mass.

Dr. Wright's salary Is increased to $2, 000 Instead of to $2,500. By request of the .board, (Mayor Stud ley occupied the floor for a few min utes, and explained the nature of the request of the board of health that that board be allowed to make a bargain for the collection of garbage, without calling for competitive bids. The mayor said that there had been only one good garbage collection in several years, and that was four years ago, when the con tract was made with Messrs. Farnham and Daley for $S,600. This is consider ably in excess of the price paid last year. The board of health proposes to give the work to thesS men this year, and Messrs. , Farnham and Daley have guaranteed to give good service for one year for '$11,000.
