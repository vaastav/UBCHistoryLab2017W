Minx Chios., Dl. Criiulre. THURSDAT, DECEMBER 13, 1861. 6$T Di our local column is an expose of certain parlies who have schemed to .swindle the Government by false invoices of lumber delivered at Cairo. gg»Thc Sumter is like the Irishman's gea—when you get where she is, ehe aint there. She was in the harbor of Martinique a few days since, and the steam frigate Iro quois crept up outside to-grab her when slie should come out - She did not come, (ur at least the Iroquois did not see her come,) and. entering the port, it was found the bird had frown \ How the escape was made, whether by magic, or by wings, or overland, is not stated. fy Nothing decisive has yet Taken place between Shoepff and Zollicoffer, on the Cumberland, but it is said that Gen. Thomas is making a movement (indepen dent of Shoepff,) to get in the rear of Zolli c offer, and that the fear of such a complica tion of affairs has caused the rebel Zolli coffer to retracehis steps a bit. We had not before heard of Gen. .Thomas in this undertaking, but it is only reasonable to suppose that be desires to retrieve his great mistake in calling off the dogs of war be fore. BRITISH CXTKEffi ES msSOUBI. The purpose of the recent exchange of his residence from this city to SL Louis of H. B. M. Consul, J. Edward "Wilkins, Esq., has been already sufficiently explained by several late occaaons that have indicated that his presence is desirable in during the present disturbances,for the bet ter protection of rights of British subjects. One case, and the latest, referred to in our special St. Lords dispatches last evening, is that of one WTieelan, who with a negro he claims as his slave, is in custody until evi dence can be produced from Canada touch ing the status of both men. From what we can make out, WTieelan’s best show is to get clear himself: he stands no chance of re taining his colored friend. 

FROM CONGRESS. The telegraph gives ns daily added proof of the fearlessness and zeal with which the Kepre&enlalives of the people at Washing * on are going into the work of investigation of the present National evils, their causes, and the errors by which their remedy has been retarded. Gen. Halleck’s Third Or der was put into the crucible yesterday. From the discussion it will appear how far our Federal officers arc influenced by “ au thorities at “Washington” as to the inter pretations of their duties and orders in cases where slavery is concerned. The friends of Humanity can thank God and Sake courage from the tone with which Congress has commenced its session, and which we trust will lie carried through un til the end. The statement is confirmed that General McClellan threatened to resign unless Secretary Cameron's Report was amended. As between the report and the commander, we should have pre ferred to sacrifice the latter.— Tribune. No doubt. Tou ‘‘preferred to sacrifice 5 ’ Missouri rather than let Fremont alone, and would niiiier break up the whole army of the Union, and let the Union, the Constitution. a:iu the Government “go to smash,” in order to carry out your extreme notions, .than to gee the war prosecuted according to military principles end the principles of the Constitu tion and common sense.— Journal. The Journal rarely rises above this spe cies of argument. It pays not the sliglitest regard to consistency, or truth, but will greedily stultify itself for the sake of gra tifying its malice towards the Tmbtjsb. Whenever it imagines it sees an opening to throw dirt at the TsiErKE, itnever fails to let fly. Self-respect forbids that we should pay more heed to its vituperation than can be conveniently avoided, and we notice it now for a different purpose than to bandy words with it. What it now denounces as‘'extreme notions,” it commended and advocated only last week. In its issue of the sth, it said: The views taken by Secretary Cameron in refer ence to the confiscation and disposition of the flavea of actual rebels, will be- read with general in- the local people of the country. Th.-bc vlen>, u< art gtad to see. agree icith the on (his gutstioh that has beta assumed in i’utpap'r. According to the reports from Washing ton, Gen. McClellan threatened to resign unless these views which the Journal so !i’llv endorsed were repudiated by the Ad ministration. It is of no earthly consequence to the country or to any human being whether the Journal was “ glad to agree ] with the position of the Secretary of War *■ ,jn the question of the confiscation and •• disposition of the slaves of rebels,’’ or dad to disagree. But it is of the highest importance to the country whether Gen. McClellan has been playing the part of mU iiary dictator to the Government. That is the point we make. He is neither the President nor Congress, but simply a Gen eral, appointed to command patriotic vol unteers, called out to put down a riavc-hold cr'.- rebellion. His duty is to obey the orders of his superiors, the President and the Sec retary of ’War: to command the soldiers, and lead them against the rebels. "What riiht, we should like to know, has an offi cer ot the army to dictate to the Govern ment its political policy? or to interfere with recommendations that a Secretary may see proper to make to the President ? or recommendations that the President may choose to make to Congress ? Hare the Journal advocate such a violation of of the Constitution? such autocratic usur pation V In its quest after subscribers, let it try that experiment and see how many it will obtain. 

«HIMXABY A KB- CEBSm,»» The New York World of the lOtli breaks the silence -which, in common with many of the Northern press, it has maintained as to criticism on military matters, with a two column article with the above caption, in which it makes some admirable points, which we present in the form of texts, ail of which loyal men will subscribe to: Tbe people have no right to dictate to their mD iiarr any particular mozemesd. for that mu*t depend upon military ' Science alone, of which tic people know nothing; but they have a right to an utterance in reference to the fond of tear they cboo%elo have prosecuted- , .... . You may know nothing of ehlp-btuldmg. but you can fitly »ay that the work upon the ship yon have ordered shall not lag. It is idle to disguise that there has been some disappointment anon" the people that oar great army on the Potomac nap remained to completely b ratio nary through the talk and. to all appearance, ib to continue so for an Indefinite period. Every one who hut- read history knows that nothing has more generally given success to rebel lions and revolutions than lack of timely and well cut valued energy upon the part «f the established Government, in its military operations. It was an opinion, too. of the Duke of Welling -lon that “ the fault with mo-t commanders, how “ c ver brave, was backwardness in taking the last *• step to bring on a battle, especially when armies were arising from deep moral anxieties, “end, after all. the uncertainties of the ipsaes. - ' Our generals cannot too well understand that delay £ inadmissible a single daybeyoad what military considerations rigorously exact. It cannot be indulged in without great injury and »-reatcr danger. The “confederacy’ - gains heart and prest Sge every hour it it able to keep our great armies at bay, Forei<m nations, too. take the failure as evidence that the confederates have great strength—a ■strength that must ultimately secure their inde pendence. Our very inactivity Is doing more than wen an occasional defeat could, to impel them to a foregone conclusion. Every man, then, who longs for the restoration <>f the Constitution as it was. has an interest m the speedy action of our commanders in the field. W hat that action shall be. we do not presume _to indicate, hliltary science nja»-t alone determine that. But action in some direction must be had. We cannot conceive that with decent Generalship any action can lead to defeat. Bui if there be risk, the risk must be incurred. Any risk i* better than the sure evil that must come from inaction. New let the reader run his eye over these few paragraphs, gleaned at .random from a sheet thrthas prid?d itself on its conservatism, and then dare to say that the people, and a press that deserves vigilantly to guard their interests, has no right thus to 

VOLUME XV. criticise military matters. It is more than a right, it is a duty. 'Will the managers of thus regard it, or Trill they wait to hear from the people in a more unmistakable manner. A SUGGESTION. Will it not be well for the public and the press to carefully forbear any theoretical or i practical teaching which shall inculcate in j our volunteers now in the field the idea that while they arc in health, and in full ! pay as soldiers, their families are any the J less dependent upon diem than wheu'they I wore at home. Many of the soldiers, as 1 well as officers, are now in the receipt of ! better wages than they have ever had be- : fore, and far better than multitudes of me chanics and laborers are receiving in this wartime. The soldier under the army rule has, or should have while in health, few and inexpensive wants to be supplied, and it is not right the money should go to the sutler which wives and children so much need at home. Let it be understood * that the soldier has, under ordinary circumstan ces, 7iii own family still to provide for, and he will be the true man and better soldier to remember and observe this duty. It is not right nor just to throw this burden up on the public, whose charities and expendi tures should not be diverted from tbe in evitable and sacred trust the care of fami lies whose protectors have fallen, or be come disabled in the service of the coun try. There will be work enough and calls enough of this class. Sanitary Matters on the Potomac, The Sanitary Commission has called GeriT McClellan's attention to the necessity of separating the small-pox patients from those suffering from less malignant diseases, smd it is expected that he •will issue an order to that effect. The public •will scarcely deem it credi ble that heretofore the poor soldiers, taken with measles, rash, mumps, orothcr infectious diseases, have been placed in the vicinity, nay, in the very with the small-pox pa tients ; and there are a number of cases on record where the patients have taken the small-pox after being cured of the measles, and spread them through the camps, causing many to die of this loathsome disease. This criminal negligence is due to the medical bu reau here, presided over by Surgeon-General Finley, which has not only permitted this thing to continue, but has in additionresented the attempt of the Sanitary Commission to have it corrected. The ravages of tliis disease are greater than is generally known. A new regiment has been infected every day for the past week, and unless immediate mcasnresare taken for removing the unfortunate patients to a separate hospital building, we may find onr noble army worse off than it would be by a dozen reverses. Gurley’s and Colouiza- turn BUI. The Eon. John A, Gurley of Cincinnati has introduced a bill into the House of Represent* ative«rtvhich declares all rebel property con fiscated, and all slaves belonging to rebels free, and provides for the appointment of Commissioners in each rebel State to cany out the confiscation of property and the liber ation of slaves in a systematic and orderly manner, and to take charge of such slaves and employ them in the service of the United Slates at reasonable wages, and in transport" ing to Florida such as may not be needed for the public service, and to apprentice them there for not more than six years at reasona ble wages to the loyal proprietors of lands; after which term of six ycars they shall be en tirely free. Florida is to be occupy by Uni ted States forces as soon and as far as practica ble, and the estates of rebels arc to be sold by Commissioners to loyal purchasers, and the slaves ef loyal citizens purchased and paid for out of the confiscation fund. It is to be governed by military law, and as a Territory, until it shall have sufficient loyal white inhab itants to entitle it to a representative in Con gress, when it may form a State Government and a Constitution excluding Slavery. The bill is carefully drawn, and provides ample safeguard against fraud, and for the compen sation of loyal creditors and sufferers by the rebellion, who arc to be paid out of the con fiscation fund. Btli Illinois Cavalry, Col. Farnsworth. Rev. Mr. Matlack, the Chaplain of Coh Farnsworth’s regiment (3th Illinois Cavalry), desires us to say that a delay, caused by the Paymaster, trill prevent his filling his appoint ments at Evanston and Crete, as recently an nounced. The messages for friends in those places will be forwarded from Chicago, as may be directed by letters he will receive there. Donations to the soldiers will he forwarded to him at Chicago from both places by the agents before named. A corrected list of the places to be visited is appended. No former dates are changed: Huntley Station, Dec. 13th; Cherry Talley, evening of loth; Rock ford, 14 th and loth; Paine’s Point, 16th; Black berry, 17th; liOdi, morning of ISth; Syca more, afternoon and evening of 18th; St. Charles, 19th; Bloomingdalc, 20th; Somo uauk, morning of 21st; Wheaton, 22d; Mor rison, 23d; Dundee and Algonquin, morning of 24th; Woodstock, evening of 24th; Chi cago, 25th. lie expects now to reach this city Thursday evening or Friday morning, Dec. 13th. Mr, Wilson’s Sutler IbolisUng BUI. The sutlers arc making great efforts to de feat Senator Wilson’s bill for the protection of soldiers against their extortion. Not satis lied with personal appeals to members of Con gress, those who have the sutlers’ pockets at heart, have prepared a printed circular for cir culation in the camps, by which every vender of gingerbread and grog is requested and re quired to contribute twenty-five dollars to a fund to be nsed to defeat the measure in Con gress. To men who charge five cents a piece for postage stamps, and two cents a piece for the commonest envelopes, this sum is a mere jagatclle. It has not occurred to the friends of the private soldier to raise money to help on the bill, but they have showered upon the Senator wbohas moved in this reform letters of thanks, and letters enumerating some of the extor tions they have suffered. Breckinridge’* Successor. Hon. Garret Davis, the Scnatorclect of Ken tucky to succeed Breckinridge, is, par excel lence, the leader in the Union movement of bis State. It is to him the State,owes the guns v. hich rendered such timely aid in preventing secession outbreaks; and from the outset he has been a rugged-issue, unconditional Union man. The election is significant of the tem per of the people. Kentucky has chosen her course, and neither War reports that she does not like, nor the inflammatory bowlings of discontented newspapers can swerve her. The voting in the Union caucus was very dose. On the first ballot there were eleven candi dates. Davis had 16 votes; Guthrie, Critten den and Bell each 15 votes; Underwood 7; Holt 3, etc. The contest narrowed to Davis, Bell and Guthrie, and the Bth ballot stood; Guthrie 40, Davis 33, Bell 27. On the 9th ballot Guthrie and Davis had each 45 votes; and on the 10th and final ballot Davis had 46 and Guthrie 45; and he was nominated. The one decisive ballot for Davis was cast by a Louisville member, who did not vote before. In the Legislature, on Tuesday, Davis was elected, receiving 84 votes, to 12 for William Johnson, secessionist, and 1 for Win. O. But ler. Mr. Davis is ill at Frankfort, but will be able to lake his scat in a few days. Senator Trumbull’* Speech* The following paragraph was unintention ally omitted in the transmission. of the re cent speech of Senator Trumbull; “Without any special act of Congress, I presume no one questions that our military commanders, in the prosecution of the war in. Insurrectionary district*, may for the time be ing seize and make use of the property of the rebels and their slaves, but on the restoration of p( ace the right of the owners would revive. jier.ee, if wc would have uniformity of action among the commanders of ourarmics, and for feit forever the property of rebels, and their claims to the service of their fellow-men, it must be done by act of Congress.” E®' At Hannibal, Mo., on Saturday last the dwelling house of Win. A. Benton was badly burned. The damage is estimated to be orcr $4,000. to Gen. William T v Sherman Insane. IFrom yesterday's Cincinnati Commercial.} The painful us in such i form that wc are not at Ig&iyTO "discredit it. i that Gen. W. T. commander of , the Department of the Cumberland, is .insane, j We leam that he at one time telegraphed to i the War Department three tames In one day j for permission to evacuate Kentucky, and. re-, j treat into Indiana. He also, on several occa- | sions, frightened the lading Union men of Louisville almost out of their wits, by the'!' most astounding representations of the over- • whelming force of Buckner, and the assertion 1 that Louisville could not be defended. The ; retreat from Cumberland Gap was one of his mad freaks. .When relieved of the command : in Kentucky, he was sent to Missouri, and { placed at the head of a brigade at Sedolia, , where the shocking fact that he was a mad man, was developed,' hy orders that his subor dinates knew to be Preposterous and refused to obey. He lias, ofeburse, been relieved al together from command. The harsh criticisms which have been lavished upon this’gentleman, provoked by his strange conduct, will now give way to feelings of “the deepest sympathy for bim’in Ms great calamity. It seems Trovl dentlahthat the country has not to mourn the loss of an army through the loss of the mind , of a general into whose hands were committed the vast responsibility of.the command in, Kentucky. [The telegraph, this morning, denies that Gen. Sherman is insane.—Ens.]- From Tipton, Ho, [Correspondence of the iliesoarl Democrat, Oth.] Gen. Pope is remoTing-.the troops under his command into winter quarters, it is said, near Otterville, while he will have Ms headquarters at Tipton. There was a scout sent out from the First Missouri cavalry, the first of last ■week, some of whom returned badly frost-bit ten ; it is said some of them may have to lose their feet. A very reckless murder was com mitted here last ’week in the camp of the First Regiment Kansas Volunteers. An Orderly directed the arrest of a man ’who had left the guard house without permission of his commander. The soldier resisted and struck the orderly, where upon the orderly fired at him and shot him through the arm, the soldier returned the fire, missed the orderly, but the ball passed through into a camp, killing a private who was reclin ing on his couch, instantly. The murderer was arrested, and will no doubt be shot, as that is the summary course taken by this regiment, under the command of Col. Deltzler, who is a gentleman and a soldier. A cood state .of feeling exists among the soldiers. They are now anxious to go forth to battle. Majors Foote, Wetherell and War mer, have been here until about all the troops are paid. They will finish their work tills week, and return to St. Louis, their headquarters. The people are anxious for the time to pass, mentioned by Mr. Seward, that is to bring so much pleasure to the friends of the Govern ment; as out here they cannot realize what is to produce it. But all arc hoping that Con gress wilijin its aggregated wisdom, fill up what the President - seems to have left out. The following instructions have just been re ceived from Lieut. CoL T. P. Andrews, which may he a guide to those interested: “No non commissioned officer of any grade can bo paid a commutation for rations by the pay depart ment.” f Gen. Halleck’s Programme, A Sedalia correspondent of the Burlington Saxek-JSyc has it from 11 reliable authority 11 that General Halleek will soon mak?a move in the right direction. He gives a programme, which, being perhaps as good aa any other mere speculation, wc give it entire: “The whole division of this department will move upon Price from five different points at the game time. Hunter, with his division from the West, to prevent a possibili ty of his going into Kansas, and prevent his devastating that State or escaping in that di rection. Generals Wyman and Asboth, from RoPa, will proceed by way of Springfield or Bolivar, to prevent his retreating South. Gen. Pope, from Svracnsc, will go m’ way of Warsaw, and Gem Steele’s division froxn Sc dnlia. These different divisions will constitute a force of about 50,000 men, with about 4,000 cavalry and two or three powerful batteries. With this programme well executed, it will be a miracle if he should escape. As to numbers —the two armies will probably be about equal ly matched. A. Rebel Major Captured. [From the St. Joseph Journal, 6th.] Last night. Major Reuben Kay, formerly of the firm of Kay *& Kay of St. Joseph, was cap tured at the residence of his uncle. Captain Kcrcheval. Information having been received that Kny was in the city, Captain Ralston, with a file of soldiers, surrounded the house, and Capt. Ralston went in and secured Kay. Major Kay has been in Price’s army since last spring, and being a graduate of the Kentucky Military Institute, was very useful in drilling the forces in Price’s army. * This is a very important ar rest, and Col. Smith deserves much credit for his capture. ‘What was Kay’s business here is not known. His friends say that he merely came to sec his parents before leaving for the South, he expressing to them, the opinion that seces sion was (lead in Missouri, and that the rebels could make no headway against the Federal forces in this Stale. We believe ourselves that Price’s army is being disbanded, for in all neighborhoods wc can hear of the return of men who have been with him, most of them being anxious to get out of the scrape, and others to avoid the rigor of a soldier’s life with the seccsh, whose food and raiment are scarce till spring time arrives, when many of them, wiliretum, if the war is not over. Major Kav has quarters at Fort Smith, and doubtless will have a trial when Gen. Prentiss arrives. » New York Central Railroad. at haxv, Dec. 11.—The annual meeting of the stockholders of the New York Central Railroad was held here to-day, and the follow ing directors were chosen by unanimous vote: Corning Albanv; Dean Richmond, Buffalo; John HT Chcdeil, Auburn; Alonzo C. Paige, Schcncctadv; John Y. L. Pruyn, AI- Boyer, Boston; Livingston Spraker, Palatine Bridge; JacobGould, Roch ester; Cornelius L. Tracy, Troy: Chas. H. Russell, New York; Richard M. Blatchfbrd, New York; Hamilton White, Syracuse; Henry H. Martin, Albany. The report of the directors, shows the coinings of the road in the month of Nov. to have been $951,120, being an increase of $220,383 over the same month last year, and the largest earnings of the Company in any one month. The surplus of the income account on the 80lh of Sept. 1861, was $3,466,852.15, investments and supplies. The annual report of the Committee of Stock holders appointed to examine into the ac counts and transactions of the Company, says: “The books and accounts of the Com pany are in good order and the system well devised,” and they show that the state ments in the report of the Company are cor rect. _ On the question of the rc-appomtmcnt of the stockholders’ Examining Committee coming up in the meeting, it was resolved, after full debate, not to again appoint such a committee, the special circumstances that gave origin to to it having passed away.. The “Anaconda” Come Again. How will the War be Conducted ?—The opinion appears to be gaining ground that the war poller of Gen. McClellan is the same as was that of Gen. Seolt—that is, to quell the rebellion by a mighty pressure, and not by a mighty slaughter.—JK i. World. Still lUsobeying. Gen. Fremont is said to have left St. Lords in violation of orders, having been directed to remain in tliat city and await further orders of the Administration. —iV. Y. World. St. Louis Items.— The Military Police on Tuesday seized at Ferguson & Glees on's foun dry a large quantity of cannon balls, concern ing: ■which there vrerc proofs of tbelrbeing des tined for rebel use. Mrs. "Walton, wife of defaulting Nicholas, has been arrested, and shares his imprisonment. Under the new order about half the civil officers have ap peared and qualified by taking the oath of alle giance.—Anew and dangerous counterfeit of City Treasury warrants has appeared. Twelve more rebel prisoners have reached St Louis from Caldwell, Boy and Clinton coun ties. a small speck of seccsh showed itself at Hannibal, Mo., on Friday last While the Illinois 26th were parading through the streets they passed a house where a diminutive rebel silk flag was flying from the gate post. One of the officers very unceremoniously ran his sword through the emblem of treason, tore it off and brought It Into camp. A spiteful she occupant of the house, who saw her “colors” thus rudely “struck,” grew very indignant, and told the officer that she should like to serve him in the same way. Illinois Teachers* Association* —Cor- rection.—We were mistaken in saying, as we did in our issue of the Bth instant, that “there has been a change of time in the meet ing of the Illinois State Teachers’ Associa tion,” and that the Association would meet on the 24th instant. No change of time has been made. The meeting called for the 24th is for another purpose—the examination of teachers. The meeting of the State Teachers’ Association will be held on the £sth, as first announced. Hon. Wm. C. Henderson, member of the last Congress from Kentucky, and now member of the State Legislature, is danger ously IU at Frankfort, with little prospect of recovery. ; • . .. |3f The wife of a famernamed 8.

The court martial is now sitting on the case of private Johnson, of the Lincoln (Mcßey nolds) Cavalry, who was taken by CoL Taylor of the 3d New Jersey, last week, when at tempting to desert to the rebels. Thecvidcncc against him is partly his own confession,-Ond is believed to be conclusive; audit is thought he will be shot. A Wisconsin regiment of McDowell’s civl sion gave the alarm last night of the enemy approaching In force. AD the divisions on the other side of the river except Smith’s were put immediately under arms, and so remained all night, and until this morning. Scouts were sent out last night, by McDowell, Hclntzel man, and Blcnkcr, who reported no enemy to be found this side of Fairfax Court House. Gen. McDowell telegraphed that a reconnoi tcring force of Blenkcr’s had been mistaken for tbe enemy. Onr troops were rapidly and fully prepared for action. Gen. Stone telegraphed this morning: Pooleville, Dec. 11,9.45 a. m. Rumors of increased force near Goose Creek, but from'personal examination from the heights, early this morning. I cannot sceas many signs ofbostile troops as before. If a large force is near Goose Creek or Leesburg, it is concealed. It is rumored that the rebels are concentra ting troops near Oceaquon, on the lower Po tomac. "Winter quarters arc now prepared for our troops, and vast quantities of lumber are go ing over tie Orange and Alexandria Railroad to Generals Franklin and Heintzelman. The soldiers arc building log huts at some points, and at others arc making their tents as com fortable as possible. Gen. Martindale was a witness in CoL Kcr rigan’s case to-day. His testimony went to prove the utter insubordination and entire lack ol discipline of bis (Kerrigan’s) regiment. Reverdy Johnson appeared as Kerrigan’s counsel. i The Star of this evening says that it is at liberty to say that if Thad, Stevens said in the caucus the other night, that McClellan threat ened to resign unless Cameron’s report was al tered, ho stated what was not true. There was a sham fight in front of the Navy Yard to-day, between boats and launches, armed with rifled howitzers. The Republican caucus re-assembled to night, and was not very lively. The debate continued on Bingham’s resolution recom mending the immediate passage of a law con fiscating rebel property and freeing their slaves. Mr, Edgerton of Ohio voted for its passage, and thought we should act and not talk. There was a desultory conversation, al most all for Bingham’s bill. Among the* speakers was Mr. Chandler of Mich, who was in favor of urging the Government with bills and resolves until there is a decisive move ment on the part of our now dormant army; Mr. Socrates N. Sherman of N. T., (Ogdens burg district,) who thought wc should strike slavery whenever we could, both as a war policy and from motives of hu manity. He believed there had been no betrayal of any secrets by the slaves, certainly none to his knowledge. He said Mc- Clellan had forbidden one New York regiment to allow 20 slaves who had come within their lines to leave them. He thought we couldn’t put down rebellion without touching property and slaves. Mr. Pomeroy of N. Y. depreca ted strife, and feared the breaking up of the Republican party. He believed In party. W c must not quarrel with the Administration. There is no longer a Republican party in Ohio, New York or Pennsylvania. Still he (Pomeroy) was in favor of the confiscation of the property of rebels, but not of loyal men. There were several other speeches, all to the same con clusion, and with apparently no great diversi ty of opinion. Senator 'Wilson’s bill gives each Congress ional District two Cadets in the Military Acad emy, which will make the whole number, even under present circumstanecs, toward four hundred- It is believed upon good authority that Arch-Bishop Hughes’s mission is to Spain, which has not behaved well toward ns of late. Since Gen.

Also, Gen. Butterfield, in honor of the bridal party, reviewedhis brigade by drill. ■ Goodrich brings to the State Department dales somewhat later than the mail, by the last steamer.

The following item relating to the action of the British Consul was handed in at the tele graph office, Monday night, but by a tempora ry derangement of the wires was delayed and then mislaid till to-day. It is still interesting: The contraband claimed at Bella by apre tended British subject, named Wheelan, has himself claimed the protection of the British Consul as a native of Canada, and the Consul has tak en the matter in hand for investigation. By : his request, Gen. Halleck has issued an order . to have the negro brought to Bt. Louis, where, evidence will be collected from Canada and elsewhere, to prove his birth-right. Wheelan says the negro was bom on the farm of Judge Goode, in St. Louis county, and Goode en dorses thp statement. Gen. Halleck promises Consul Wilkins that the negro shall be sur rendered to him if proved a British subject, and if not, an effort will be made to show that Wheelan bn& violated his neutrality by encourogingthe rebellion, and if he loses the negro the British Consul will afford him no assistance to recover the same. A rebel militaiy band of musicians, captur ed by scouts from thclTth regiment, has been brought to Sedalia and pressed into the ser vice of playing Yankee Doodle for the Union boys. The river has risen nine inches in twenty four hours, and is still rising. Probably the gunboats Benton and Essex, aground at Cape Girardeau, will reach Cairo .to-night or to morrow. Since the seizure of the books of Child, Pratt <fe Fox, of the Oak Hall clothing estab lishment, there are rumors of various other seizures by the Provost Marshal, which, how ever, lack confirmation. Tiic Evening Ifcvrs complains that a Union city officer who wrote to ascertain whether the oath of allegiance was to be taken by city officers, has been presented by his secession associates, who are trying to procure his re moval for alleged officiousness. Another batch of prisoners arrived to-day by the North Missouri railroad- Two spies, lately arrested, have been order ed by Gen. Hnlleck to be tried for their lives. A Military Commission has been appointed for that purpose. The reported insanity' of General Sherman is a humbug. His. difficulties are of a less se rious nature. The reported expulsion of John W. Noeli, member of Congress from this State, is erro neous. He was one of the first to protest against secession, and is Captain of a Union company in Perry county. John W. Reid was doubtless meant.

Nett York, Dec. 11.—A private letter from on board the steamer Richmond, -which took part in the fight at Fort Pickens, dated Nov. §3d, states that the vessel commenced bom barding Fort Mcßae at ten o’clock on the 22d. The wntcr states that he had been compli menting the Captain of one of the guns on the accuracy of his aim, when a shell bounded thron ,r h onr bulwarks, tookhis (theCaptain’s) head off, and wounded six more men. This shell, on exploding, raised the ship oat of waterandmade heritaggerlike a drunken man. Another shell burst six'feet below the water line, causing a badleak. but the steam pumps kept the vessel free. The firing continued all dav, and was resumed by the enemy next morning, when we moved out of his range. : The frigate Niagara stdl kept at them, but being outside the bar, she cannot be much driTTPg™* Fort Pickens had, up to date, lost but one man killed and seven wounded. Fort Mcßae is much damaged, but we can not destrov it with our smooth-bore guns, as thev are no match for the enemy’s rifled can non. The bombardment was to be renewed the next day, 2sd, with the determination to Tvilip or be Whipped, . Since leaving the passes of the Mississippi several vessels had managed to escape. A Spanish vessel had come down with a number of fugitive Spaniards, to escape impressment, who report that the rebels had three iron-clad steam battering rams ready to repel attack, each carrying eighteen to twenty of the heavi est gunsj and additional steam rams and fire rafts were being constructed. Skinnlsh near Russellville, Kf. • r LorisvnxE, Dee. 11.—The report that Capt Nevltt, with forty men of CoL Burbridge’B regiment, burned the bridge at Whippenville, five miles from Rus ellviUe, on the Memphis Branch Road, is confirmed.

THE PROCEEDINGS OF COSGKESS. • Washisgton, Dec. 11,1861. SENATE, Mr. SUMNER of Massachusetts presented a petition for the emancipation of the slaves; those of the rebels without compensation, and those of Union men to be paid for. Mr. WILSON of Massachusetts offered a resolution that .the Committee on Military Affairs be instructed to inquire and report to the Senate what reduction may be made in the expenses of the army. Agreed to. Mr. CHANDLER of Michigan offered a resolution instructing the ifililaiy Committee to inquire into the expediency of appointing a joint committee of the two Houses of Con gress, who shall have power to retire any im proper officer of the army or navy. Agreed' to. : Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, introduced a joint resolution for the confiscation of the property of rebels* and for the satisfaction of the claims of loyal men. Mr. H averts of N. Y. introduced a bill establishing a new mihtaiy and mail route to Baltimore. Referred to the Military Comxoit- tec. Mr. WILSON of Mass.' introduced a bill to increase the number, of Cadets at-Wcst Point. Refereed to the Military Committee. Mr. NESMITH of Oregon announced the death of his late colleague, Edward Dickinsou Baker, U. S. Senator from Oregon, and paid a brief and feeiipg tribute to his worth and bravery, and offered the usual resolutions of respect to his memory. Mr. HcDOUGALL of Cal. followed, refer ring to the decease of two distinguished Senators, Messrs. Douglas and Baker. Messrs. BROWNING and COWAN fol lowed. Mr. LATHAM of Cal. closed with a most beautiful, eloquent and touching eulogy on the deceased, when the Senate adjourned. ___ house of representatives. On motion of Mr. HOLMAN of Indiana it was resolved that the Committee on Public Lands should report what railroad company had received donations of lands on condition of transporting troops and munitions of war free of charge, and whether the Government has the unqualified right of such transporta tion. Mr. LOVEJOT of Illinois offered a resolu tion instructing the Committee on Foreign Affairs to report a hill establishing diplomatic relations between the United States and Havti and Liberia. The resolution lies over. Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, offered a resolu tion declaring it just to recognize the eminent and patriotic services of the late Gen. Lyon, and tendering the thanks of Congress to the brave officers and soldiers under his command who sustained the honor of the flag and achieved a victory at Springfield, Mo.; and in order to commemorate tlic event, each regi ment engaged on that occasion bear on its colors the word “Springfield,” in letters of gold, and that these resolutions be read at the head of the different regiments of the army of the United States. Mr. Blair believed the Government had taken no notice at all of the death of Gen. Lyon, and hence the propriety of the passage of the rcsolntion. He knew the man well. One never lived who could do more for his country and less for himself. The resolution was adopted. Mr. Lansing’s preamble and resolution of fered on Monday came up. Mr. THAD. STEVENS, of Pa., said if the passage of the resolution is to have a good effect, especially in the "West, the sooner it is passed the better. The allegation of Gen. Halleck as an excuse for his order that fugi tive slaves whom hcjproposcs to exclude from his lines, gives information to the euemy, is too bald a pretext to justify him. The return of fugitive slaves was Initiated by Gen. McClellan, and had been followed by Gens. Dix, Kelly and others. All these cases are a disgrace to the profession of arms. If such returns of fugitives have been made by orders of the commanding Generals, they deserve to have their epaulettes stripped from their shoulders; and if it Las been done by higher authority, then God forgive them, for they know not what they do. Mr. LOVE JOY of Illinois expressed his hon est conviction that such orders were issued by the Commanding Generals of the Army with out orders from the President. He was satis fied of this fact. While the President does uot remove and cashier them, as he (Lovejoy) would, he did not believe the Commanding Generals had power for such inhuman and shameful measures. Mr. 

BLAIR of Missouri said Mr. Stevens had evidently misunderstood Gen. Hallcck’s order. The ’latter (Halleck) informed him that he had no idea of doing anything contrary to the law of the last Congress and the policy of the Government. A debate ensued between Messrs. Blair and LOVEJOY, on the subject of Geu.Halleck's re cent order about slaves. Mr. JULIAN ot lad. referred to the case of Col. Brown, of an Indiana regiment, who refused to deliver up fugitives until so ordered by Secretary Cameron. "He presumed the Ad ministration sanctioned such proceedings. Mr. KELLOGG assumed to say the Admin istration laid nothing to do with that order, and would not indicate such policy to the army. The resolution which caused this debate was finally tabled, 78 to 64. The resolution looking to the recognition of the independence of Havti and Liberia was adopted, with an amendment that the Com mittee on Foreign Affairs inquire into the ex pediency of doing so. The subject of abolishing the franking sys tem came up,when Mr.COLPAX remarked that the Committee on Post-Offices had framed a bill to abolish it. Tho hill also requires mem bers to show the absolute necessity of new Post routes. Adjourned.

From Vera Cm*—Mexican Feeling about tlie Allied Intervention—Es capeof Charles Andersonfrom Texas, New York, Dec.Yl.—The steamer Colum bia, from Havana 6th, has arrived. The rebel steamer YanderbuiL 393 tons, ar rived at Havana on the 3d, five days from New Orleans. „ . , ~ filing. Anderson and family arrived on the Columbia from Havana. He is a brother of Gen. Robert Anderson, and escaped from the hands of the rebels at San Antonio, Texas, and walked to Monterey, Mexico. He was treated with great kindness by the Mexicans. He sailed on Die British steamer Clyde to Ha vana. He reports that, though British sub jects whom he met were violently indignant at the seizure of Mason and Slidell- on the Trent, he and family were treated with kind ness, Anderson’s family was originally sent to the Mexican frontier, while he was held a prisoner of war. The Clvde met the Spanish .fleet and army within SO hours sail ofvera Cruz, with fine weather. The Mexicans were daily expecting the allied fleet. The general feeling appeared to be hatred of Spain. All fends were giving way to a sentiment of united resistance to the common enemy, and the frequent remark was, if the Spaniards come alone, they will be heart ily welcomed. No resistance, however, was to he made at Yera Cruz or Tampico. The gnus of the Castle of San Juan de UUoa were icing carried inward. If Mexican symptoms can Be trusted, a determined resistance to any Spanish invasion will he made. From Calr<s— eklrmUh* ' Cairo, HL, Dec. li.—Two companies of infantrv, nnder command of Lieut.

Somer set is six miles this Vide of the river, and has never" .been'in possession, of thc.-rebels,]fts heretofore reported. The letters were receiv ed by Ifc SafiKil,.proprietor of the stage line to Somerset, and are reliable. " '■’ . i w . - . s& yj : ' Prom Washington,- WAsarxGTON, Dec. EL—The question of the exchange of pnioners seems to be fairly set tled. The New York Executive Committee bad several lengthy snd interesting interviews with the President, Gen. Mcdellan, and Sena tors and members of the House, all of whom: favor it. The Committee 7 s interview with Gen. McClellan was especially gratifying. He spoke of the subject briefly but warmly, and from Ha conversation had evidently given the subject much study. The Military Committee in both Souses have reported favorably on the subject, and a- joint resolution, which passed the House, requesting the President to make an exchange, will pass the Senate. An ex change has been practically going on. Thirty prisoners were sent from here yesterday to Fort Monroc r and large numbers have been releasefffrom Fort Warren, Our Government has replied to the invita tion of England, France and SjSiia to take part in the expedition against Mexico', declin ing to have anything to do with it. A letter from a dozen in the western part of North Carolina, to a friend in Washington, has passed the rebel lines, and was to-night placed in the hands of General McClellan. It brings the clearest confirmation yet received that there is a large and* determined organiza tion ofUnionists In that State. They are put ting themselves in communication with the Unionists in East Tennessee, and await only the dawn of hope for a general uprising. They expect Brownlow to be reinforced by Govern ment, and will accept that movement as the si<rnal for their own action. It is currently stated that the Military Com mittee of the House favor the treatment of the privateers captured by 'our vessels as pris oners of war. A dispatch was received at headquarters laic last evening, stating that two regiments of In fantry and “one of cavalry, of the rebels, had made their appearance in front of General Blenker’s division. It was reported also that a pretty largo rebel force had taken of Springfield, a place which had been aban doned by them some time ago. The rebels have been advancing quietly in the direction of our lines for some days in several direc tions, evidently with a view of ascertaining onr position. Ail the small sloops and schooners that were below the blockade have succeeded in running 1 up safely. The echo of rebel artEllciy has been heard all to-day near Fall’s Church, probably prac ticing at CentreviUc. Near Alexandria there could be heard all the afternoon heavy and steady firing down the Potomac, supposed to be near Freestone Point. The regular troops surrendered to the rebels in New Mexico by Major Lynde and released on parole, consisting of one company of the 3d Cavabw and fire companies of the-7th infantry, are to be stationed on the Northern frontier, and will probably garrison the posts of Detroit, Fort Niagara, Fort Ontario, Sack ett’s Harbor and Rouse’s Point. CoL C. A. Waite, of the Ist Infantry, is assigned to the command of a District, embracing the above named posts. Washington, Dec. 11.—The President has declined to communicate to Congress any communications addressed by the Govern ments of England, France and Spain in regard to the armed' Intervention proposed by them in the affairs of Mexico. He deems it inexpe dient at this exigency to do so. The select committee appointed by the Speaker of the House on that branch of the President’s Message relating to the defence of the Northern lakes and rivers, consists of Messrs. Arnold of Illinois, Ashley of Ohio, Noel of Missouri, Aldrich of Minnesota, Bab bitt of Pennsylvania, Spaulding of New York, Granger of Michigan, Wheeler of New York, and Potter of Wisconsin. Washington, Dec. 11.—European letters state that Russell writes that the Administra tion is becoming disposed to accept foreign mediation with a view to compromise on the basis of separation. Scoutsreport the rebelforcc at- Fairfax Court House very light, but between there and Vi enna there is an increased force. The Republican members hold an adjourned caucus to-night. Price Near Osceola and Stationary— Sickness in his Camp—Movement of tho Brigade—Rebel marauders. [Correspondence of the Leavenworth Conser vative.] Oss.vwatamie, Dec. 4. —The report of Price’s northern movement, together with the an nouncement that we were to be paid off, in duced Col. Montgomery to move the Brigade to this place. The sensations from Price have been fully sifted, and amount to this: He does not in tend coming io Kansas, and docs not dare cross the Osage. Our troops at Rolla, Sodjdia,. Jefferson and Tipton desire nothing more than to have Price cross the Osage. Our scout system, as you are aware, is near ly perfect. We have been through Missouri so often that we know every locality, almost every prominent man. When the Kansas men fail to get correct news of the position-and strength of the enemy, then the best right hands will cease to have cunning. Price is encamped a short distance below Osceola with 12,000 men, and is in no condi tion to move. His men arc poorly clad, and have not half the tents they need. The result is a greater amount of sickness than was ever known in a camp of that size. In a proclama tion published bv him on the 22d of Novem ber, lie says he has lost three men by sickness where he has lost one by bullets. That pro clamation is a most painful and humiliating appeal for help. Heaskii for 50,000 men, and a dozen times over the demand is reiterated. He save boys have done the fighting, while men of vigor and health have remained safely at home, and says the cause is lost unless he can have more and better aid. In short, Price is despondent, and if Halleck and Hunter half do their dutv he can be speedily played out. A disturbance has arisen in CoL Ritchie’s regiment. The men have elected a new set of officers, and CoL Ritchie has resigned. Wc all regret tho rupture, but hope it may be amica ble settled. Col. Weeris regiment moves up to Wyan dotte, and we go back to Fort Scott for winter quarters. Gone to Exchange Himself, Boston, Dec. 11.— Ex-Minister Faulkner, released from Fort Warren on parole, has gone to Richmond to endeavor to exchange nun self for Congressman Ely. Nriu abberUscments.

There arc periads In the world’s historv marked by extraordinary and violent wins, enddea as the break ing forth of a volcano, or the bursting of a storm oa the ocean. These crises-sweeo away ins moment the landmarks of generations. Thev call out fresh talent, and give to the old a new direction, it is then that new‘ldeas are horn, new theories- developed. Such periods demand fresh exponents, and new men tor ex pounders. This Continent baa lately been convulsed by an up heaving so sadden and terrible that the relations of all men and all classes to each other are violently dis turbed, and people look about for the elements with which to sway tbe storm and direct the whirlwind. Just at present, wc do not know what all this 15 to bring lortb: but we do know that great results MCST flow from such extraordinary commotions. Ataiußcture so solemn and so important, there 15 a special need that the intellectual force of the country snonld be active and efficient. It is a time for great minds to speak their thoughts boldly, and to take posi tion as the advance guard. To this end, there Is a spe cial want nnsnpplied. It is that of an IMDEPENDEHT BIAGAMWE, Which shall be open to the first intellects of the land, and which shall treat the Issues presented, and to be presented to the country, in atone nowaytemperedhy partisanship, orinflaencedbyftear.CiTor, or the hope of reward: which shall seize and grapple with the mo mentous subjects that the present disturbed suite of affairs heave to the surface, and which CAN NOT be laid aside or neglected. To meet this want, theundersinnedhave commenced, under the editorial charge of
