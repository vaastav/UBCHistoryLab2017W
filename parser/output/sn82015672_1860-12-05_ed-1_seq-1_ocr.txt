Messrs Gwin, 'larlan, Johnson of Tenn., Thomp son and Wilkinson appeared in their seats. Prayer was offered up by the Chaplain. Mr. Rigler, in behalf of the Committee to wait upon the President, reported that it ha. I performed its duty. The President's mes sage was delivered by A. J. tilof sbreuner, his private Secretary. After the reading of the Message, Cling tu in moved lo have it published, lie thought it fell short of investigating the crisis. The. President elect is known to tie a dangerous man, and bis party would eventually control the ( iovernmeiii, the Su preme Court included, lie did not think the Stales had acted precipitately. In his judgment a number of the States would se cede within sixty days. In South Carolina J tho submission party is small. The wisest j thing Congress can do is to divide the pub- I lie property, as fairly as possible, after pay- . ing Ihe public debts. j Crittenden replied, hoping the example, j of tho gentlemen would not be followed. j Better not come here at all. The Union was wortlivot ;reat saenlicc ami conces sions. He looked forward to disunion with fear, dismay, and trembling. Tiny must search for means of reconciliation and har mony. He hoped there would be no angry debates. North Carolina always had carried the olive branch of peace. Clingnian approved of the desire to pre serve the Union. When the Union ceases to protect North Carolina she w ill bid it good bye. The usual copies were ordered priuted and the Senate adjourned. Nkw Yohk, Dec. 4. The Times's Wash ington correspondent says that reliable in formation from Texas, reports the peo ple of Texas on the eve of f revolution against the State Government. Gov. HoHston refuses to call the Legislature lor the purpose of calling a Convention. It is believed that Senator Clingnian will soon offer a proposition for peaceable separation of the States and a fair division of assets and liabilities. It is rumored that Secretary Thompson resigns on Thursday, and will lie succeeded by Gov. Pratt of Maryland. The President has dispatched Mr. Pres cottj assistant Secretary of State, to South Carolina, with copies of the message to Gov.

The President re j views the history of the nnti-slavery rnove ' ment, and says all that is necessary to ae ! compiish the object of peace is for the slave hoi iing States to be'let alone to manage their domestic institutions in tLcir own way. The I mere election of any man to office ia not a just measure for a dissolution of the Union. The antecedents of th President elect are calculated to excite fears iu South Carolina, but is the question of contingent danger sufficient to justify (he destruction of the government, lie reviews the acts of the different northern States in the passage of personal liberty bills, aud pronounces them iiucotislil'.itional. lie says that it should not lx presumed in advance that the Presi dent elect will fail fo enforce the Fugitive Slave Law, us this would be unjust and con trary to Christian charily. Let us wait for the overt net. He then declares against the right of Secession, aud says to admit it the U uion might be broken into fragments in les than two weeks. He quotes the lan guage of Jackson and Madison. Secession is altogether founded on an in ference not in the Constitution. The Union was designed to be perpetual. He then quotes the Constitution in support of this j view. Ihe I miners ot tins Constitution never intended to plant in its bosom seeds for its own destruction. They were not guilty of tin' absurdity of providing for its own dissolution. The right of resistance against tyranny and op iression, however, cannot be denied. This right i.j asserted iu the Declaration of Independence. Rut se cession is neither more nor less than revolu tion. He speaks of the affairs of South Carolina, lie docs not apprehend that an attempt will be made to seize the forts, but if he is mistaken in this the officers have orders to act strictly on tho defensive; let the responsibility rest on the heads of those who provoke the contest. He invokes his country uienjto pause before attempting tode stroy the Union which has conferred so many benefits. He argues that Congress can do much to restore peace by preparing and recommending an amendment to the Constitution for "remedying the existing evils. The very course lie recommends is to have an cpHnatory clause or amend ment on the i;lavt:y question 1st. Expre-vdy recognizing the tight of property iu slaves in States where slavery now exists, or may hereafter exist. 2nd. The duty of protecting such right3 in all the common Territories until the latter are admitted as States into the Union. ::rd. A like recog'v ' ion Here the report livkc off. Ei:. Joi n. Should this apprehension of domestic dan ger extend and intensify until it shall pervade the masses of the Southern people, then dis union will become inevitable. Self-preservation in ihe first law of nature, and no po litical union, however fraught with bless ings and benefits iu all other respects, can be lo.'.t; continued if the necessary conse quence be to render the homes aud firesides of neai-i y .If the parties to it, habitu&lly and hop. s.-l v insecure. Sooner or later the bond of such n union must be severed. It is my coiivictioii that this fatal period has mil yet arrived. Alter relet ing to the incessant agitation against slavery at the North for the last twenty-live y ears, both by the press and 111. people, and asserting that the time of Congress was occupied with violent speech es on this tiovor-ciiiling subject, he remarks : How easy would it le lor the American people to settle the slavery que''ioii forever and restore pence ami harmony to this dis tracted country, which cci be done by lc' ling the slave Slates alone and permitting Ihem to manage their own State affairs, as they only are responsible before God for slavery existing among them, and with which the North has no more right to in terfere than wiih similar institutions in Rus sia or Brazil. The President relics ort the .rood Sense and ihe forbearance of" the peo ple, alleging it is out of Ihe power of any President lo accomplish but little; which leads him to observe that Ihe election of any one of our fellow-citizens to- the oflice of President docs not of itself rOord just cause for dissolving the Union. The late election having been held in strict conformity with the provisions of the Constitit ion, does not justify a revolution to destroy this very Constitution. Reason, justice, find a it gard for ihe Constitution all require Cat we shall wait for some overt and dangerou? t on the part of the President elect before re sorting to such a remedy. Mr. Buchanan refers to the fact that tho President's province is not to Miake but to execute the laws. It is alleged as one cause for immediate secession, that tin? Southern Stales are denied equal rights with the other Slates in the Common territories. Rut l.y u hat. authority are these denied ? Not by Congress, which has never passed, aud which I believe never will pass, any act to exclude slavery from these territories ; nnd certainly not by the Supreme Court, which has solemnly acceded that slaves are prop erly, and like all oilier property, their own ers have a ri;:ht to take them into the Com mon territories and hold them under the protection of the Constitution. The antici pation that Congress may pass some law obnoxious is not a good reason for dissolu tion. The President re-asserts the power of Congress over property in the territories, and the sacred rights of property are rec ognized by the Constitution. The tuosl palpable violations ut Consti tutional duty which have been committed consists iu the acts of different State Legis latures to defeat the execution of the Fngi tive Slave Law. It ought to be remember ed, however, that for these acts, neither Congress nor any President can justly be held responsible, having been passed iu vio lation of the Federal Constitution. It will l the duly of the next President, as it has been my own, to act with vigor in execut ing the Fugitive Slave Law against conflict ing enactments of State Legislatures. We are not to presume in advance that he will violate his duty, which would be at war with every principle of justic. Let us wait for the overt act. The Fugitive Slave Law has been carried into execution in every contested case since the commencement ot the present adminis tration. IjcI ns trust that the State legisla tures will repeal their unconstitutional and obnoxious enactments. Unless this snail be done without unnecessary delay, it is im possible for any human, power to save the L'nion ; and the Southern States have a right to demand this act of justice from the Northern States. Should this be refused, the injured States, after having first used nil peaceful means to obtain redress, would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the government of the Union. The alleged principle that as each State became a party to the Cnioa by the votes of ita own peo ple .assembled in Convention, so any one of them may retire from the Union in n similar manner by the vote of such Con vention, is wholly inconsistent with the history as well as tho character of the Fed eral Constitution. lie then rehearses a portion of Gen. Jackson's message of 1833 relative to the nullifying ordinance of South Carolina avd says : This government was inti tul' i! by its founders to be perpetual and not to be annulled at the pleasure of any one of the contracting parties. The President enu merates the powers conferred on Congress by the Federal Government.
