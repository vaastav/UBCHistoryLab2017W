17000 trees planted for shelter we find that during a number of years the ash and black locust stanl close planting best The black locust has long been disregarded because it was not understood and was planted closely and by itself Under these cir cumstances it will fall a prey to borers will rootsprout badly and become a nuisance Planted with heavy foliage trees in the grove however borers will not trouble it and while it makes an exceedingly rapid growth yet it will yield valuable timber In rapidity o growth it equals the willow cotton wood and poplar and yet it will not impoverish the soil and other trees will grow well with it It is of the same family as the clovers that feed instead of rob the soil Iron Visiting Cards Among the curious uses to which iron has been placed is that of visiting cards Many great iron manufacturers have had the metal rolled in sheets so thin that it has been successfully employed for this social use It Is interesting to know that the cards of Count

SECRETS OF SUCCESS The secrets of success are many but one of them doubtless is the doing of whatever is to be done a little better than others do it The Sunlight gives the following instance in illustration of this for the benefit of its readers and it is one by which those who are forming habits can well profit and at the same time the boys of older growth may take it to heart with ad vantage Upward of 30 years ago when David Maydole was a roadside blacksmith at Norwich N Y six carpenters came to the village from the next county to work on a new church One of them having left his hammer behind came to the blacksmiths to get one made there being none which gave satisfac tion in the village store Make me a good one said ttte carpenter as good as you know howM But said the young blacksmith who had al ready considered hammers and had arrived at some notion of what a ham mer ought to be and had a proper contempt for cheapness in all its forms Perhaps you dont want to pay for as good a hammer as I can make Yes I do I want a good hammer And so David Maydole made a good ham mer that perfectly satisfied the car penter The next day the mans five com panions came and each of them wanted just such a hammer and when they were done the employer came and ordered two more Next the store keeper ordered two dozen which were bought by a New York tool merchant who left standing orders for as many such hammers as David Maydole could make And from that day to this he has gone on making hammers until now he has 115 men at work He has never nushed never borrowed never tried to comoetp with others in price because other men had done so His only care has been to make a oerfect hammer to make as many such as people wanted and no more and to sell them at a fair price SYSTEM ox TUB FARM In every department of labor the essential to success is a systematic method System is especially needed in farm work because thrift of so many living things is in the power of the farmer There should be a regular hour for feedin stock Animals soon learn the hour for their meals when given regularly and are impatient of delay Bawling bleating or squealing ai for an hour berore each meal aces not A hasten the development of fat in calves lambs or Digs At other times the food is given too soon the animal rot being hungry and not prepared to make the best use of it There should fce a certain time to begin feeding in the mornin = and a time at which to quit feeding at night or rather even ing for we dont believe in feeding after dark except in the shortest December days The farmer who feeds his stock by lantern light during spring and fall months will be apt to get crops in late and pick corn till holidays The family meals should not vary ten min utes from the specified time neither should the men ever keep meals wait ins Children should be off to school on time neither too late nor too early They will be more apt to have their lessons on time if everything is regular at home The work is so much easier to do when every one knows his time and place life is more pleasant and happy times come oftener System 1 preserves health for we know that worry kills more persons than disease Good Idea of a Wealthy Miser Haunted with the Idea that he had only j a short time to live Stephen Langford a wealthy miser of White Hall near Rich mond Ky sent for his nephew W A Langford and made him a present of 5000 in cash and a fine blue grass farm his idea being to avoid possible litgatlon after his death Some time ago the old gentleman had his coffin made and a tombstone prepared and now says he is ready for the death angels summons
