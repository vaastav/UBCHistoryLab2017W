ft! PEACE WITH Ml NATIONS President Taft Sends in Special Message Reviewing Our Relations With Other Countries. L Important General Movement for Broader Arbitration On Part of Powers is Noted—Mexican War Dis cussed-Merchant Marine Needed. Washington. Dec:. 7.—The first of Pres’- dent Taft's promised special messages was read in congress today. It deals en tirely with foreign affairs. The message In part follows; The relations of the United States with other countries have continued during the past twelve months upon a basis of the usual good will and friendly intercourse. Arbitration. The year just passed marks an Im portant general movement on the part of the powers for broader arbitration. In the recognition of the manifold benefits to mankind in the extension of the policy of the settlement of International dis putes by arbitration rather than by war, and In response to a widespread demand for an advance In that direction on the part of the people of the United States and of Great Britain and of France, new arbitration treaties were negotiated last spring with Great Britain and France, the terms of which were designed, as expressed in the preamble of these treat ies. to extend the scope and obligations of the policy of arbitration adopted in our present treaties with those governments. To pave the way for this treaty with the United States, Great Britain negotiated an important modification in Its alliance with Japan and the French government also expedited the negotiations with sig nal good will. The new treaties have been submitted to the senate and are awaiting its advice and consent to their ratification. All the essentials of these Important treaties have long been known, and it is my earnest hope that they will receive prompt and favorable action. Claim of Alsop & Cos. Settled. I am glad to report that on July 5 last the American claim of Alsop & Cos. against the government of Chile w. s finally disposed of by the decision of his Britannic majesty George V., to whom, as amiable compositeur, the matter had been referred for determination. His majesty made an award of nearly $1,000,- 300 to the claimants, which was promptly paid by Chile. The settlement of this controversy has happily eliminated from the relations between the republic of Chile and the United States the only question which for two decades had giv sn the two foreign offices an> serious concern ami makes possible the unob structed development of the relations of friendship which It has been the aim of this government in every possible way to further and cultivate. Arbitrations. In further Illustration of the practical and beneficent application of the princi ple of arbitration and the underlying broad spirit of conciliation, I am happy to advert to the part of the United States In faoiliating amicable settlement of dis putes which menaced the peace between Panama and Costa Rica and between Haiti and the Dominican republic. Since the date of their Independence, Colombia and Costa Rica had been seek ing a solution of a boundary dispute, which came as a heritage from Colombia to the new republic of Panama, upon its beginning iife as an independent na tion. In January, 1910, at the request of both governments the agents represent ing them met In conference at the depart ment of state and subsequently conclud ed a protocol submitting tills long-pend ing controversy to the arbitral judgment of the chief Justice of the United States, who consented to act in this capacity. A boundary commission, according to the International agreement, has now been appointed, and it is expected that the ar guments will shortly proceed and that this tong-standing dispute will be honor ably and satisfactorily terminated. Again, a few months ago it appeared that the Dominican republic and Haiti were about to enter upon hostilities be cause of complications growing out of an acrimonious boundary dispute which the efforts of many years had failed to solve. The government of the United States, by a friendly interposition of good offices, succeeded in prevailing upon the parties to place their reliance upon some form of pacific settlement. Mexico. The recent political events in Mexico received attention from this government because of the exceedingly delicate and difficult situation created along our south sm border and the necessity for taking measures properly to safeguard Amerl -an interests. The government of the United States, in its desire to secure a proper observance and enforcement of the so-called neutrality statutes of the federal government, issued directions to the appropriate officers to exercise a dili gent and vigilant regard tor the require ments of such rules and laws. Although a condition of actual armed conflict ex isted, there was no official recognition of belligerency involving the technical neu trality obligations of international law. On the 6th of March last, in the ab sence of the secretary of state. I had a personal interview with Mr. Wilson, the ambassador of the United States to Mex ico In which he reported to me that the jondltions in Mexico were much more critical than the press dispatches dis posed; that President Diaz was on a vol iano of popular uprising; that the small SUtbreaks which had occurred vv°re only symptomatic of the whole condition; that a very large per cent, of the people were in sympathy with the Insurrection; that a general explosion was probable at any ame, in which case ho feared that the 

MO,OOO or more American residents in Mexico might he assailed, and that the very large American Investments might be Injured or destroyed. After a conference with the secretary of war and the secretary of the navy. I thought it wise to assemble an army division of full strength at San Antonio, Tex a brigade of three regiments at Galveston, a brigade of intantry in the Los Angeles district of southern Cali fornia. together with a squadron of bat tleships and cruisers and transports at Galveston, and a small squadron of ships at San Diego. At the same time, through our representative at the City of Mexico I expressed to President Diaz the hope that no apprehensions might result from unfounded conjectures us to these mili tary maneuvers, and assured him that they had no significance which should cause concern to his government. I am more than nappy to here record the fact that all apprehensions as to the effect of the presence of so large a mili tary force in Texas proved groundless; no disturbances occurred. From time to time communications were received from Ambassador Wilson, who had returned to Mexico, confirming the view that the massing of American troops in the neighborhood had had good effect. The insurrection continued and resulted In engagements between the regular Mexican troops and the insurgents, and this along the border, so that in several Instances bullets from the contending forces struck American citizens engaged In their lawful occupations on American soil. Proper protests were made against these invasions of American rights to the Mexican authorities. The presence of a large military and naval force available for prompt action, near the Mexican border, proved to be the most fortunate under the somewhat trying conditions presented by this inva sion of American rights. The policy and action of this govern ment were based upon an earnest friend liness for the Mexican people as a whole, and it is r. matter of gratification to note that this attitude of strict impartiality as to all factions in Mexico and of sincere Works Splendidly. “How do you like your ‘nickel- Arsf phone?” “Well, sir.

"It dis couraged the ticket speculators.” friendship for the neighboring nation, without regard for party allegiance, has been generally recognized and has re sulted in an even closer and more sym pathetic understanding between the two republics and a warmer regard one for the other. Action to suppress violence and restore tranquility throughout the Mexican republic was of peculiar inter est to this government, in that it con cerned the safeguarding of American life and property In that country. On May 25, 1911. President Diaz resigned. Senor de la Barra was chosen provisional presi dent. Elections for president and vice president were thereafter held through out the republic, and Senor Francisco I. Madero was formally declared elected on October 15, to the chief magistracy. On November 5 President Madero entered upon the duties of his office. Honduras and Nicaragua Treaties Proposed. ■^ s t * le situation In Central America, i “ a Y taken, occasion in the past to em phasize most strongly the importance that snould be attributed to the consumma tion of the conventions between the re publics of Nicaragua and of Honduras and this country, and I again earnestly recommend that the necessary advice and consent of the senate be accorded to these treaties, which will make It possi ble for these Central American repub lics to enter upon an era of genuine eco nomic national development. Our relations with the Republic of Panama, peculiarly important, due to mu tual obligations and the vast interests created by the canal, have continued in the usual friendly manner, and we have been glad to make appropriate expres sion of our attitude of sympathetic in terest in the endeavors of our neighbor In undertaking the development of the rich resources of the country. The Chinese Loans. The past year has been marked in our relations with China by the conclusion of two Important international loans, one if r the construction of the Hukuang rail ways. the other for the carrying out of the currency reform to which China was pledged, by treaties with the United States, Great Britain and Japan, of which mention was made in my last an nua! message. Especially important at the present, when the ancient Chinese empire Is shak en by civil war incidental to its awaken ing to the many influences and activity of moderization. are the co-operative pol icy of good understanding which has been fostered by the international projects re ferred to above and the general sym pathy of view among all the powers in terested in the far east. New Japanese Treaty. The treaty of commerce and navigation between the United States and Japan, signed in 1894, would by a strict Inter pretation of its provisions have terminat ed on July 17. 1912. Japan’s general treaties with the other powers, however, terminated in 1911. and the Japanese gov ernment expressed an earnest desire to conduct the negotiations for anew treaty with the United States simultaneously with Its negotiations with the other pow ers. There were a number of important questions involved in the treaty, includ ing the immigration of laborers, revision of the customs tariff and the right of Americans to hold real estate in Japan. The United States consented to waive all technicalities and to enter at once upon negotiations for anew treaty on the un derstanding that there should be a con tinuance throughout the life of the treaty of the same effective measures for the restriction of immigration of laborers to American territory which had been in operation with entire satisfaction to both governments since 1908. The Japanese gov'i.-nment accepted this basis of nego tiation, and anew treaty was quickly concluded, resulting in a highly satisfac tory settlement of the other questions re ferred to. Europe and the Near East. In Europe and the near east, during the past twelve-month, there has been at times considerable political unrest. The Moroccan question, which for some months was the cause of great anxiety, happily appears to have reached a stage at which it need no longer be regarded with concern. The Ottoman empire was occupied for a period by strife in Al bania and is now at war with Italy. In Greece arid the Balkan countries the disquieting potentialities of this situation have been more or less felt. Persia has been the scene of a long internal strug gle. These conditions have been the cause of uneasiness in European diplo macy. but thus far without direct politi cal concern to the United States. In the war which unhappily exists be tween Italy and Turkey this government has no direct political interest, and I took occasion at the suitable time to is sue a proclamation of neutrality in that conflict. At the same time all necessary steps have been taken to safeguard the personal interests of American citizens and organizations in so far as affected by the war. In spite of the attendant economic un certainties and detriments to commerce, the United States has gained markedly In Its commercial standing with certain of the nations of the near east. Coronation of King George V. The 22d of June of the present year marked the coronation of his Britannic majesty. King George V. In honor of this auspicious occasion I sent a special embassy to London. The courteous and cordial welcome extended to this gov ernment’s representatives by his majesty and the people of Great Britain has fur ther emphasized the strong bonds of friendship happily existing between the two nations. Settlement of Differences With Great Britain. As the result of a determined effort on the part of both Great Britain and the United States to settle al! of their out standing differences a number of treat ies have been entered into between the two countries in recent years, by which nearly all of the unsettled questions be tween them of any Importance have been adjusted by agrement or arrangements made for their settlement by arbitration. Recognition of Portuguese Republic. The National Constituent assembly, reg ularly elected by the vote of the Portu guese people, having on Ji>t> 19 last unanimously proclaimed a republican gov ernment. the official recognition of "the government of the United States was given to the new republic In the after noon of the same day. International Conventions and Confer ences. The supplementary protocol to The Hague convention for the establishment of an international prize court, mentioned in my last annua! message, embodying stipulations providing for an alternative procudure which would remove the con stitutional objection to that part of The Hague convention which provides that there may be an appeal to the proposed court from the decisions of national courts, has received the signature of the governments parties to th original convention and has been ratified by the government of the United States, togeth er with the prize court convention. The deposit of the ratifications with the government of the Netherlands awaits action by the powers on the dec laration, signed at London on February A Trying Role. “Poor fellow.

The fur-seal controversy, which for nearly twenty-five years has been the source of serious friction between the United States and the powers bordering upon the north Pacific ocean, whose sub jects have been permitted to engage lr. pelagic sealing against the fur-seal herds having their breeding grounds within the jurisdiction of the United States, has at last been satisfactorily adjusted by the conclusion of the North Pacific sealing convention entsrad mto beWeffla the t nited Slates, Great firlt'in, Japan and Hussia on the seventh of July lash The addition of congress is especially called (dr the necessity for legislation or tn- par>. of the United'States for the ptlf pose of i ’inning the obligations assumes ypdcjr this convention, to Which the sen ate gave its advice and consent on th twenty-fourth day of July last. international Opium Commission, In a special message transmitted to the congress on the seventh of January. 1911, m which I concurred in the recommenda tions made by the secretary of state in regard to certain needful legislation for tne control of our interstate and foreign traffic in opium and other menacing drugs, I quoted from my annual mes sage of December 7. 1909, In which I an nounced that the results of the Interna tional Opium commission held at Shang hai in February. 1909. at the invitation of the United States, had been laid before this government; that the report of that commission showed that China was mak ing remarkable progress and admirable efforts toward the eradication of the opium evil; that the interested govern ments had not permitted their commer cial Interest'llo prevent their co-onera tion In this reform; and. as a result of callatera! investigations of the opium ouestion in this country. I recommended that the manufacture, sale and use of opium in the United States should be more rigorously controlled by legislation. Prior to that time and In continuation of the policy of this government to se cure the co-operation of the interested nations, the United States proposed an international opium conference with full powers for the purpose of cloti.'ng with the force of international law the reso lutions adopted bv the above-mentioned commission, together with their essen tia! corollories. The other powers con cerned cordially responded to the pro posal of this government, and. I am glad to be able to announce, representatives of all tb® powers assembled in conference at The Hague on the first of this month. Foreign Trade Relations of the United States. In my last annual message I referred to the tariff negotiations of the depart ment of state with foreign countries in connection with the application, bv a se ries of proclamations, of the minimum tariff of the United States to importa tions from the several countries, and I stated that, in its general operation, sec tion 2 of the new tariff law had proved a guaranty of continued commercial oeace. although there were, unfortunate ly, instances where foreign governments dealt arbitrarily with American interests within their Jurisdiction in a manner in jurious and inequitable. During the past year some instances of discriminatory treatment have been removed, but I re gret to say that there remain a few cases of differentia! treatment adverse to the commerce of the United States. While none of these instances now appears to amount to undue discrimination in the sense of section 2 of the tariff law of August 5. 1909, thev are all exceptions to that complete degree of equalitv of tar iff treatment that the department of state has consistently sought to obtain for American commerce abroad. While the double tariff feature of the tariff law of 1909 has been amply Justi 'fied by the results achieved in removing former and preventing new, undue dis criminations against American commerce, it is believed that the time has come for the amendment of this feature of the law in such way as to provide a graduated poeans of meeting varying degrees of discriminatory treatment of American commerce in foreign countries as well as, to protect the financial interests abroad of American citizens agains*: arbitrary and injurious treatment on the part of foreign governments through either leg islative or administrative measures. It would seem desirable that the maxi mum tariff of the United States should embrace within its purview the free list, which is not the case at the present time, in order that it mieht have reasonable significance to the governments of those countries from which the importations Into the United States are confined vir tually to articles on the free list The fiscal year ended June 30. 1911. shows great progress in the development of American trade. It was noteworthy as marking the highest record of exports of American products to foreign coun tries. the valuation being in excess of $2,000,000,000. These exports showed a gain over t’’e preceding year of more than $300,000,000. Crying Need for American Merchant Marine. I need hardly reiterate the conviction that there should speedily be built up an American merchant marin". This Is nec essary to assure favorable transporta tion facilities to our great ocean-borne commerce as well as to supplement the navy with an odeauate reserve of ships and men. It would have the economic ad vantage of keeping at home part of the vast sums now paid foreign shipping for carrying American goods. All the gr-at commercial nations pay heavy subsidies to tbeir merchant marine, so that it is obvious that without some wise aid from the congress the United Stater must lag behind in the matter of merchant marine in its present anomalous position. ■Legislation to facilitate the extension of American banks to foreign countries is another nutter in which our foreign trade needs assistance. With these factors and the continuance of the foreign-service established (depart mental. dinlomatic and consular) upon the high plane where it has been placed by the recent rearoganization this gov ernment would be abreast of the times in fostering the Interests of its foreign trade, and the rest must be left to the energy and enterprise of our business men. Improvement of the Foreign Service. The entire foreign-service organization is being improved and developed with especial regard to the requirements of the commercial interests of the country. The rapid growth of our foreign trade makes It of the utmost importance that governmental agencies through which that trade is to be aided and protected should possess a high degree of effi ciency. Not only should the foreign rep resentatives be maintained upon a gen erous scale in so far as salaries and es tablishments are concerned, but the se lection and advancement of officers should be definitely and permanently reg ulated by law. so that the service shall not fail to attract men of high character and ability. The experience of the past few years with a partial application of civil service rules to the diplomatic and consular service leaves no doubt in my mind of the wisdom of a wider and more permanent extension of those principles to both branches of the foreign service. I therefore again commend to the fa vorable action of the congress the enact ment of a law applying to the diplomatic and consular service the principles em bodied In section 1733 of the Revised Stat utes of the United States, in the olvil service act of January 16. 1883. and the executive orders of June 27. 1906, and of November 26. 1909. In its consideration of this important subject I desire to recall to the attention of the congress the very favorable report made on the Lowden bill for the improvement of the foreign service by the foreign affairs committee of the house of repre sentatives. Available statist'es show that the strictness with which the merit sys tem has ben applied to the foreign serv ice during recent years and the absolute non-partisan selection of consuls and diplomatic service secretaries who Indeed far from being selected with any view to political consideration have actually been chosen to a disproportionate extent fron states which would have been un represented in the foreign service under the avstem wihch it is to be hoped is now permanently obsolete. Some legislator for the perpetuation of the present sys tem of examinations and promotions upon merit and efficiency would be of greatest value to our commercial and internation al interests.

MAINE BLOWN UP FROM THE OUTSIDE Vreeland Naval Board Gives Out Its Findings. ALL SIGNS POINT TO MINE Report Declares injuries to Bottom of Sunken Battleship Were Caused by Exterior Explosion, Confirm ing Original Investigations, Washington.—The United States battleship Maine, which was sunk in Havana harbor in February, 1898, as the result of an explosion, wa,s blowm up from the outside. This was am nounced by the Vreeianu board, which has been examining the wrecx lor several months, in a statement given out by the navy department. The statement given out by the navy department is brief. Secretary Meyer does not believe it necessary to issue an extended explanation of the board’s conclusions, beyond the flat statement that an exterior explosion was re sponsible fur the loss of the warship and the lives of many men. The statement follows; “The injuries to the bottom of the Maine were caused by the explosion of a charge of a low form of explosive ex terior to the ship, between frames 28 and 31, strake B. port side. This re sulted in igniting and exploding the contents of the six-inch reserve maga zine, A-14-M, said contents including a large quantity of black powder The more or less complete explosion of the contents of the remaining forward magazine followed. The magazine ex plosions resulted in the destruction of the vessel.” Secretary Meyer announced that there might be a further statement on the report of the board after it had been considered by the president. One member of the board was of the opin ion that the report never w’ould be published In full, bu* would be kept in the confidential archives of the navy department. The declaration that “a low form of explosive” was used in the outside ex plosion Indicates a belief that a mine and not a dirigible torpedo was the in strument of destruction. This deepens the mystery of the de struction of the Maine. A mine, charged with sufficient gunpowder to blow in the bottom of the ship, must have weighed several hundred pounds. To plant such a mine and lay the elec tric connections necessary for its dis charge would have required the serv ices of a number of men.

The United States Supreme court refused to grant a stay of proceedings to the packers under indictment in Chicago on charges of violating the criminal sec tions of the Sherman anti trust act. This means that the ten packers must go to trial at Chicago. The court’s decision was the final step in a long legal contest to avoid trial at this time. Shortly before they were first cited for trial on November 20 nine of the indicted packers sought to have the United States circuit court at Chicago release them from on the ground that the Sher man anti-trust law, under which they were indicted, was unconstitutional as a criminal measure, particularly in view of the recent interpretation of the law in the Standard Oil decision. Chief Justice White announced the decision of the court. No opinion was handed down, the chief justice con tenting himself with the mere state ment that the packers’ motion was re fused.

BLACK DAMP DELAYS WORK Nine Mangled Bodies Recovered by Rescuers After Thirty-Six Hours of Unceasing Toil—May Require Many Days to Reach Others. Briceville, Tenn.—Somewhere in the depth of the Cross Mountain coal mine probably 100 men lie dead, while their stricken families keep vigil at the mouth of their tomb, hoping against hope that their lo ,T -3d ones may be alive when rescuers reach them. Eight torn anti mangled bodies had been brought forth after thirty-six hours of un ceasing toil by every surviving miner in this region. Outside of the im mediate families of the entombed men, no one in this little mountain village believes that any living crea ture in the mine has survived the terriffic explosion of coal dust that wrecked the workings. The work of rescue has moved slowly and its progress repeatedly stopped because of black damp. Mine experts say it may be many days before each lateral has been penetrated and all the bodies recov ered. The corpses found in the mine in every instance were bruised as if they had been thrown violently against the ceiling of the mine or the timbers on the side walls.

Last winter Wheeler was a prize winner at the provincial seed fair in Regina.
