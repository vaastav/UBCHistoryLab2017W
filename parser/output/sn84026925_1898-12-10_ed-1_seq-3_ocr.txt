Rock Hill Herald, Wednesday : A scaffold 140 feet long and 14 feet high, which had been erected on the first floor of the new store of A. Friedheim & Bro., fell with an alarming crash on Monday while a number of men were on it at work ; but fortunately none were seriously hurt, notwithstanding the scaffold was covered with heavy plank, which fell upon and covered nearly all the men. Mr. Hugh White was more painfully hurt thau anyone else, and yet bis injuries are not serious. Messrs. S. T. Frew, Louis Friedheim and J. S. Underwood, George Mobley, Sara Jackson, Jr., Randall Douglass and Charlie Foster were also on the structure, and all but the last two named received slight injuries. It is a miracle that someone of the number did not sustain serious wounds. Martin Massey was also on the platfonn ; but he clutched a strip nailed on the sleepers and swung there until he found a way to reach the flour unhurt. SalettJay In Cherokee.

Representative Hull, chairman o the house committee on military af fairs, on Tuesday, introduced a hill in creasing the regular army to upproxi mately 100,000 men. The bill was framed at the war department, am has the approval of the secietary o war. It is not the bill framed by Gen eral Miles,as this measure has not tin high rank proposed by the Miles bill and some of the appointments an open to officers of the .volunteer arnn or from civil life. It provides for i lieutenaut geueral and what is consid e ered a sufficient, increase of major and i 3 brigadier generals to commaud an I r army of 100,000 men scattered from < j Puerto Rico to Mauila. I The artillery arm is reorganized, sep* arating them into coast and field ar3 tillery, but promotion to be by senioti- t - ty of the whole arm. A decrease of en- ( f listed men is made, so that arm can j be increased by recruits in case of war > to full strength. The enlisted strength \ of an infantry company is not tc ex- t " ceed 145, so that iu case of war new j ' regiments would have to be formed, ( . probably all of which would be volun- t 3 teer; but the regular army would f , make a substantial first line.

Under the immediate control of the ' president, inhabitants of the new countries may be enlisted in the organiza( tions there serving. , The bill gives a total of fourteen ( regiments of artillery, twelve of cavalry and thirty of infantry. 

MERE-MENTION. Four men were killed and several 1 were seriously injured on Castle Island, in Boston harbor, last Tuesday afternoon, by the explosion of a mine which the men were removing from the bottom of the channel. The cause of the explosion is unknown. Senator Hale, chairman of the committee on naval affairs, has introduced a bill providing for the revival of the grades 8 of admiral and vice admiral in the ; i navy. The Spanish newspapers characterize President McKinley'e message as discourteous. The grand lodge of Maryland has followed that s of Kentucky in refusing to acknowl- 1 edge Negro Masons.

The report of Attorney General Griggs to congress, shows that during the recent war with Spain, the United ? States captured 56 prizes and realized 7 from them the sum of $701,034 net. The flagship New York arrived at Havana on last Wednesday. I The president has nominated Brigadier a Generals Guy V. Henry and Leonard Wood to be major generals. General Wood entered the service as colonel of Roosevelt's Rough Riders.

SOUTH CAROLINA NEWS. n Three Ex-Governorg. \ Columbia correspondence News and a Courier, Tuesday : There was a rather a remarkable meeting in the Columbia tl club this morning. It was by the merest a chance that three ex-governors of ^ the stale met aud talked about old ^ times. The party might have been in- * creased to the fourth ex-governor by the presence of Ex Governor Richard- 81 son, who frequently meets with hisdistinguisbed friends at the Columbia t] club, of which he was president for so q long a time. The three ex-governors who met and chatted pleasantly this morning in the parlors of the club were: Governor Wade Hampton, Governor Hueh S. Thompson and Govern or Jobn C. Sheppard. Another distin- guished member of the party was General E. P. Alexander, who was on his way to Nicaragua, where he goes on business. o State Immigration Committee. ^ Columbia Record : At the forth com- \ ing meeting of the legislature, Mr. . Francis H. Westou will introduce a bill which, if passed, will be of great _ benefit to the state. His measure 7 contemplates the establishment of an ( office to be known as that of the slate I immigration commissioner. As the ? name implies, the duty of the commisj-ioner will be to induce desirable im- " migrants to settle in this state. North Carolina, Georgia and some other j southern states have such an official, p and statistics show that they have been very succes>ful iu inducing desirable settlers to come to those states. Gen- J erally the duties will be to keep well ^ posted as to suitable lands in the state e which may be bought, the price of the lauds, what they are adapted to growing, and to be able to give general -i information as to the resources of the J state. It is contemplated that he <' should correspond with emigrants from r Europe and states of the Union, and possibly spend much of his time in New York, where he could meet emi- .. grauts face to face and turn them to J his state. There is plenty of room in ^ the state for more white people, and it ^ can be easily seeu that Mr. Weston's ^ ' idea is a good one. l ne question may ; come up as to the expense of such an office; but the bill will not likely pro s vide for more than $2,000 or $2,500 for J ' the expense of the office. This is a e ' mere bagatelle compared to the good ! the state would derive from it in having a desirable addition to its citizenship, which would materially develop ' her resources. ? ?-?- 8 5 General and Congressman ? J Major General Wheeler probably ha< , f seen his last service in the army, says t a Washington dispatch. He was at 1 the war department last Wednesday - and had a talk with Secretary Alger > and Adjutant General Corbiu. It is * 1 understood that he will be relieved t f from further active duty unless there t - is a recurrence of war; but that he " will reinuin on the active list of the . , United States volunteer army until f that army is mustered out of the ser- i f vice by the declaration of peace. This 1 i privilege is accorded to him in recog- j nitiou of his distinguished services, tnd will leave General Wheeler frei ;o exercise his functions as a membe )f the house of representatives durinj bis session.
