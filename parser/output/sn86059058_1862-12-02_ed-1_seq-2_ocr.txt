Those failing to receive their paper will thus know what is the matter. Many, no doubt all, of our sub scribers are good, but the trouble of collecting small amounts scattered through the country is such as to ren der the credit system terri bly unprofitable. Those in arrears for the Journal will please forward the amount due AT ONCE, thereby sav ing trouble. The President's Message. We confidently expected to famish our readers with the President s Mes sage this morning, or at least with an abstract of it Owing, however, to some trouble with the "repeater'' at Vin cennes, our expectations were disap pointed. The failure to get the Message is our apology for a " short" paper. US' The Charley Bowen came in on Sunday covered with American flags from stem to stern. The Charley has a passion for the American flag. The boat left yesterday with a fine trip. The Bowen is now, one of the neatest packets on the river, having been thoroughly overhauled, reuovated and painted. Ev erything about her is as neat and hand some as a woman.

Having thoroughly renovated their large warehouse on Lo cust St near the Canal, Geo. Foster k Co., are now engaged in cutting and packing pork quite extensively. They are also "trying out" large quantities of lard daily. Of course, there is quite a rush to seenre "tender loins," bones, &c, and a stream of baskets is kept going to aud from the warehouse, at almost all hours of the Uav. 19 If the following named persons will call at the Medical Director's office, they will receive the pay due them for services rendered at Hospital No. 5: Esther Phebus, Francis Irwen, Caroline Caldwell, Sophia Heller, Catherine Min amen, Eliza Johnson, Elizabeth Orton. Oow Richmond is to be Taken. From the l'Mlad-lpM rrese, Not. 27,1 Our advices from the Army of the Po tomac to-day indicate a heavy increase and continued re-enforcement of the reb el army on the Ilappahannock about Fredericksburg, and this fact will, no doubt, be used as an alarm signal by the enemies of the Government to create di visions among the people, and detract from that confidence in our military lead ers which has been gaowing in every State rapidly for the past few weeks. In view of this cruel and most unpatriotic action on the part of our real malcon tents, it is only necessary for us to say that General Burnside's private dispatch es have created a hopeful feeling among those who have the destinies of the coun try in charge for the time. The move ment of then rny has been very satisfac tory in its conception and execution; and while its results are already partial lv opparent, and will be creditable, no one can look at the histoay of the present week and say that this concentration of the rebels has not been one of the results of this movement The rebels, in making a stand at Fred ericksburg, are only defendini? their capi tal, depot of supplies, fortified base, and entire Southern communication. The Rappahannock River is the main line of defense before Richmond. To cross it with our array, in force, Bumside is now ordered; in the event of which the rebels must fall back behind the James River, their second line of defense. Appre ciating the importance of the strategy evinced in our movement to the Rappa hannock, the rebels are concentrating about Fredericksburg, and Gen. Lee s army is now defending Richmond. We could do nothing better than meet the enemy in an extensive pitched battle just where he is. We believe that Gene rals Bumside, Sumner, Hooker, and Franklin are anxious and able to "try conclusions" with Lee, Longstreet, Jack son, and Hill, right upon that beautiful series of slopes between the Rappahan- nock and Massaponnax, in eight of the ancient town now beleaguered fcy the opposing armies of the Umon .-.nd rebel States. . That a battle will be fewght near this spot we have no doabt, aad the heavier it is, the worse witt be the result for the rebels. Lee's army is the sole defense and life of the Southern cause a defeat nfttiBt nrv would be death to the re The overthrow of this army of bellion. the Potomac during the coming month, J That it is competent to the task no one ' n doubt.

The Falmouth correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer, under date of the 2utli, says: The presumption is that in a very few days we will have a battle in this vicinity that will 'eclipse all others of this war in regard to ferocity and fierceness. There is not the slightest doubt but thnt the enemv is in creat force on the other side of the river eqnnl if not su perior to our own in point of nnmbers. I have reason to believe that General Lee is in command, in person, of the whole rebel army of the Potomac ex ceeding without doubt. 125,000 men. Their camp fires can be seen extend ing at least ten miles along the river, and from observation five miles back into the country. This is no fancy of the brain. This is a powerful army to intercept another army in crossing a riv er. Although neither as wide nor deep as the Schuylkill, yet it is an almost im passible barrier to' artillery. There are fords that can be waded by infantry, yet a caisson would be floated if an attempt was made to get it over, except by a bridge. The enemy, as usual, have picked out an almost impregnable position, and have been for a few days past working like beaver3in throwing up fortifications. Morniti". noon and night they are hard at it with spade and pick, the dirt flying until the walls or rifle-p:ts are com pleted. Their prese.it position is on the brow ot a range oi nign uhim. some ui tmnm hack of the river, with a heavy wood in their rear, and very probably some of their works have been erected in the timber, as this is their usual cus tom. They have invariably Uk)B ad vantage of hilly and wooded positions places that nature has already made se cure from assault It is my opinion that back of the pres ent range of hills where their works are now erected, there is another range which they will occupy if driven from their strong position. The railroads will, very likely, be fin ished this morning sometime. This will be the means of supplying the troops with rations in abundance. As it now is, with the wagons, it is an utter impos sibility to get rations accumulated two days ahead. Our army should at least have twelve days rations ahead, so as to meet an emergency at any time. ' thnt) Tny. T, .. T : . 1 . .

The intelligence from West Tennessee and from Mississippi is exciting, and we may expect it to be more so very soon. On Wednesday Gen. Sherman left. Mem phis with his forces, and on Friday Gen. Grant's army struck their tents at day light and marched off upon the Holfy Springs road with seven days' rations and but one tent to twenty men and only six wagons to a regiment Without hav ing any special knowledge upon the sub ject, we suppose that Gen. Sherman, who, we may be sure, is destined for some theatre where hard fighting is looked for. is to bear a part in the great land and river expedition for the taking of Vicks burg and the opening of the Mississippi, wlnle Geu. Grant, there can hardly be a doobt, is moving with the utmost energy upon Van Dorn s army wherever it may be, intending either to capture, destroy, or disperse it, and then to hasten on to V lcksburg or to any other point where the services of his victorious cohorts may be needed. The rebels may perhaps give him battle at Holly Springs or Jackson or elsewhere, but it seems evident that they cannot maintain themselves in that section, and that they are themselves aware of it We are entirely confident, that, at the end of a very few weeks, all formidable rebel opposition will be at an end in Western Tennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, and that the gieat river will be opeu to the nation's commerce throughout its whole extent And there are unmistakable signs of equally vigorous work in other quarters.

Journal. Thanksgiving Day at Crescent City Sabbath School. Mb. Editor . It was our privilege to wituess the fifth anniversary exercises of this school, held on Tuesday, 27th ult. It occurred to us that more than a nassmff nonce is notice is due this interesting Sabbath School. There were over six hundred officers, teachers, and children present, besides a large representation of our good citizens, among whom we were pleased to notice Mayor laker, Messrs. Samuel Orr, M. A. Lawrence, Win. P. Iglehart, Dr. Jones, Ashby, S. E. Gilbert, with many others. The military was well represented by Col. Baker, Col. Foster, Capt. Hurd, and quite a number of other military gentle men whose names we did not icarn. After a number of "voluntaries" sung as only the boys and girls of this school do sing, led by the renowned Tileston, the programme was opened by Rev. Mr. Blythe, chaplain of Hospitals Nos. 1 and 4, who led in prayer. The assembly was then addressed severally by Rev. W. H. McCarer, Col. Foster, Capt Hurd, and John Glover, Esq., a song intervening be tween each speech. The teachers had prepared ample refreshments, including lots of " goodies," which were distributed amongst the children by the teachers and citizeni. We never in our life saw a more smil ing, laughing, happy set of young folks, than we met on this occasion. Col. John W. Foster assisted in the organization of this school, and was for years its very popular aud efficient superintendent. When the Col. volunteered in the service of his country, and exchanged his office in this school for one in the 2oth Regi ment Indiana Volunteers, we entertained great fears that this excellent institution would suffer by the change, and perhaps " go under." But we are. happy to know that our fears have not been realized. Mr. H. F. Blount, who succeeded Co!. Foster in its management, tills the bill, and is perfect ly at home at the head of this Division of the great S. S. army. ini-Jaii! 4Vi ' he, J,ae jovial almost worship their teacher. The fe male division is taught by two very nice young ladies. In his arduous duties, Mr. Blount is assisted by many of our prominent busi ness men and a host of good ladies who serve most faithfully as teachers. Our youngjfriend De Witt Lanphere is Secre tary, and furnishes each child every Sab bath with a beautiful S. S. paper. From his annual report, we learn that no less than fourteen thousand nine hundred and seventy-six numbers of this paper were distributed amongst the scholars of this school during the year ending on Thanksgiving day. Infidels and scoffers may look upon these things with contempt, and endeav or to "laugh them to scorn," but no branch of christian enterprise has been more signally owned and blessed of God than the Sabbath School. We never enter this hall that we do not in our imagination meet the full round pleasant countenance of a boy who now sleeps in death. (. Uarles Canstadt was a German lad, of over sixteen summers, was a good boy naturally, but the religion of Christ. which hejhad embraced, made him better. He was a "regular" in this School al ways when well to be found in his class. We knew Charley well and had witness ed the trial of his virtue and honesty. He was also a patriot and when his country called for help in the hour of her danger and humiliation. ClinrW , j responded and joined Captain Willard's Company, 14th Regiment, Indiana Vol. unteers. For months he served his but countryjfaithfully in Western Virginia, contracted camp fever and died. Capt Willard (who brought his remains home) in reply to our inquiries about the gen eral conduct of the boy soldier, said " he was one of the best boys I ever knew I loved him as my own son."
