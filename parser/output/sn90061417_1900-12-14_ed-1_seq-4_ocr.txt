The Message. Inevitably the annual message of the President contains much that is of only special interest and the public attention turns first 10 the treatment of those subjects which are uppermost in gen- j eral thought and esteemed of the great- j est public interest. The President him self yields to this sentiment and opens his message with a complete review of the Chinese complication, its historical sources the course of events from the uprising to the relief of the legations in Pekin; the policy pursued by this gov ernment and the sueces-ful efforts to secure unanimity of action by all the governments interested Little is stated that was not known, but it gives the stamp of authenticity to what had rested in unoflicial statement, while it disposes of much that was unauthentic rumor. The next topic to which readers will turn for information, lwtli8 as to what has been done and what is intended or recommended to be done, is the treat ment of the affairs in the Philippines. The President takes occasion to eail "the wards of the nation," and Fays our obligations as guardian was not lightly assumed; that it must not be otherwise than honestly fulfilled, aiming first or all to benefit those who have come un der our fostering care It is our duty so to treat them that our tlag may ha no less beloved in the mountains of Luzon than it is at home: there, as here, it shall be the revered symbol of liberty enlightenment and progress in every avenue of development. Uncle Sam's Exchequer. The provisions cf law that requires the Secretary of the Treasury to make annual report directly to congress dis tinguishes that department from others which report to the President, who com municates their rejwrts to the congress, and expresses the importance attached to the fiscal affairs of the government. The relation of outgo to income is quite as important to a nation as it is to each individual in it. So after the Presidential message we turn to the re port of the treasury to ascertain what government has cost us and whence the money came with which to defray the expenses, and whether the balance is on the right or the wrong side of the ledger. One gains some more accurate con ception of the magnitude of tho nation and its affairs when told that from all the various sources of revenuo there came into the treasury in the fiscal year that closed with last year June, the sum of G69,5P5,4.11. a sum equal, if it were evenly distributed among the pop ulation, to 83.77 a head. The outgo during the same period amounted to $590,003,371, leaving the comfortable balance on the right side of $70)97,000: a surplus that, as Col. Fred Grant once said, is much easier to handle than a deficit. There are three sources of in come whose amounts require nine fig ures for their statement: the internal revenue at the head with 6295,327,920 to its credit; the customs bringing in S233, 101,871, and the post with its $102,.T54, 579, tho three supplying all but about 840,000,000 of the entire receipts. Cus toms, that always held first place, yields precedence to internal re-enue. It is comforting to be told that while re ceipts have increased 8o8,C13,42(, ex penditures have diminished Si 17559,388.

The hot of the regular terms of our comity court for the year was held last week, and a large amount of routine business was disposed of. It will be the last term in which Judges Wise and Morgan will participate, they retiring on January 1st, and will be succeeded by Judges elect Norman and Pullen. We have the utmost confidence in the new judges elect, but we must say that if they but show the ability, and con servatism of their predecessors, then will their official duties be up to a very high standard indeed. Messrs. Wise and .Morgan have made most capable judg-s. They have shown themselves to be i-vety way fitted for their position, and in all matters have pursued a wise, cautious anil impartial course, and in our judgment it will be a long time be fore Holt count will have a more cap able set of district judges.

Every farmer should have an interest in such I organizations, and should attend this meeting. The following from the Worth County Times of last week is along the line of some suggestions of The Sf.nti- nkl heretofore made on tho same sub ject: "If the leg slature will pass a law this winter providing for the assessment and collection of the taxes within the same year, it will be the means of larco ly augmenting the state and county revenues. Missouri is ono of the few states that assesses personal property and then gives a man la months in which to leave the state with his be longings. Assessments should beirin in March and be completed by July. That will give the assessor plenty of time to make out his 1kk's and the county cl-rk to ext-nd the taxei so as to nut the Ixxiks into the hands of tho collector by November 1st. Then make a five per cent penally alter January i. 'lhat will increase revenuo receipts all over the state by very largely decreasing tho de linquent tax last." Public Ailministrat'ir's Notice.

"I am very suiierstitious," said Vine llovey, the Forest City Burlington agent, to us the other day, and I have frequently ridiculed those peopio who consider Friday an unlucky day. But am beginning to think that I owe those people an apology. I am inclined to be lieve now that thpre is something bad ab mt Friday. I know there is in the railroad business. I have been watching it for a long time and, you may take my word for it, that Friday always hoodoos the railroad business. At least it hoo doos the passenger business. I don't know so much aliout the freight end of the business "I have noticed for a long time that our business alwas drops off on Friday. Sometimes we do a rushing business right up to Friday and then do nothing that day. But Saturday business will go on as rush iDgly as before. Then I have noticed .that no matter how dull other days are. 'Friday is always 'a degree duller. I have puzzled my braiu trying t3 find a rational solution, but I can't do it, and so have unwillingly concluded that Fri day is simply a hoodoo for the passenger department.

Will Polk and others for a while thought they had struck a veritible Klondike one day last week. While tearing down the old barn on the Laugh lin pro)erty, preparatory to building a new one. they found underneath the sill, an old box in which was found what seemed to be a gold watch and other articles. Tho watch was short a few of its insides, but tho case was in good condition. The other arlicli-s wpro of no value whatever, and tho watch isn't supposed to be of any vhIuc either. Polk and his other helpers continued the search for a while, then came to the conclusion that they were in Ore gon and not the Klondike.
