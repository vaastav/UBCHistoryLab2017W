AT THE WHITE HOUSE Senator Perkins Discusses Japanese With the President. MIGHT MODIFY THE TREATY Thinks Orientals Would. Have Ho Cause for Offense. CALLS OF NEW YOBKEBS Two Special Messages to Be Sent to r*r?ao finiriA Tltnft TVlla Month. Senator Perkins of California after calling cn the President today uxprt-faed the bellof that the President would bow to ?entlment on the Pacific coast and shortly enter Into negotiations with Japan for the exclusion from the United States of peons and coolies of that country. "I am perfectly satisfied that the Preal aoni, wno is a patriotic Amfntan, wui awn bo found opening negotiations with Japan for the modification of the existing treaty (13 to the admission of Japanese to this country, and that this treaty, like that with China, will provide that peons and coolies cannot come Into the United States," said Benator Perkins. "Would Japan become offended If such a request should be made by this oountry?" he was asked. "I cannot see how. The Japanese gov cm men i claims mm it uues uvi want nese laborers to come to this country. It Is absolutely certain that we do not want thorn and that we will not have them. The Japanese claim ttiat they prefer that their people shall go to Korea and Manchuria. If that Is true that country could have no ?L ? - - *? /looUa UUJfVlJVIH lu VUi uc^il c w 

??MWUV v?v.v people." "Did you talk to the President about the reference In his message to the use of the armed forces of the United States?" "No. I did not. and he did not make any mention of It to me. but I am satisfied that he meant It In case the Japanese needed protection. The President means to do what Is light, and I believe this thine will come out all rlsrht. He will learn that the Pacific coast is unanimous In Its sentiment, and he will not resist that sentiment. "More fuss has been made about It east than out west. The truth Is that there ere not forty Japanese children of school ftgp In the city of San Prancl9co, and probably not 100 in the whole state. Therefore it seems to me that the small nun*foer of children should make no objection to attending the schools set aside for them and maintained by taxation of white taxpayers. Here In Washington there are separate scnoois ror wnue ana coiorea cnudren. In California we have a law forbidding any minister to marry a Caucasian and a Mongolian. There has never been ny rumpus about that. 80 why should there be about separation of the school children? Kclaim that we hare not violated the treaty with Japan In letter or In plilt. If the courts see fit to uphold the contention that the treaty U violated we will see that a new treaty la made that will not give aueh rights." Another Strained Situation. Senator I<a Kollette of Wisconsin this morning visited the President to Introduce Representative Nelson of Wisconsin. Aa he was about to leave to go to the Capitol he came faos to f*e? with Senator Bpooner, who had coma to call on the President with Senator Du Pont of Delaware. There was not the ghost of a smile on olther side; not the slightest nod Mr. ffpooner passed on Inta the executive offices. while Mr. La Toilette went on his way. In the last session of Congress. or until near the close at least, these two Inveterate political enemies exchanged frigid greetings when they met and actually had several conferences about pat ronage. To all appearances now they will not confer ajfaln. The President must decide between the recommendations of the two men as to patronage, and tt will not be long before he will be put to the test. New York Political Visitors. New York republicans were prominent at the White House today, but the calls on the same day seem to have been a mere coincidence. Senator Depew, Representatives Parsons. Olcott, Bennett. Cocks, Law and Calder all saw the President, but their calls were brief and not collective. Later In the day William Barnes, Jr., of Albany, generally credited with being the shrewdest republican politician outside of New York city and enjoying close relations at the Whits House, called on the President and had a long talk with htm. Mr. Barnes would not discuss the object of his call. Timothy WoodrufT will oe here Saturday morning in conference with the President, and this will be followed by a visit next Wednesday by Governor-elect Hughes. There was a rumor that Governor Higgins was In the city, but this was denied at the White House. Tariff and New Taxation. 'T think It has escaped the attention of most people." said representative Boutell of Chicago, "thai in the recommendations of the President as to an Inheritance and Income tax he suggests that these questions be considered 'when next our system of taxation is revised.' Although I have not talked with the President on this subject. It is plain to inv mind that he Keans that the tariff should be revised and Inheritance and Income legislation all enacted at the same time, together with any other revision of uw taxation system tnai may be necessary. Just how long this will delay the new repositions of the President or how soon It will brim forward revision of the tariff 1 cannot say. It la really appropriate, though, that all these things should be considered together. If they are considered at all. The government Is getting an enormous revenue now, and the pnssage of Inheritance and income tax laws would greatly swell the revenues. If the collections should b< ? n1 nuu.u u*3 CAin-tim lue KUVt'rn ment would be compelled to reduce ltf revenues no as to prevent taking out of Circulation too much money." Watson on Ship Subsidy. Representative Watson of Indiana, republican whip of the House, has accepted the idea of a ship subsidy in a partial manner When asked for expressions of his pinion on this subject today he said: "I am against the ship subsidy proposition as It stands; decidedly against it. but 1 am Willing to vote for a measure that will giv? subsidy to South American ship lines, and not to exceed two lines to tbe Philippines."

PANAMA ROAD CONTROL MOBGAN WOULD VEST IT IN THE CANAL COMMISSION. In accordance with the notice flven yesterday Senator Morgan today addressed the Senate on his resolution looking to glvIng to the Panama canal commission con trol of the Panama railway. In reply to a question from Senator Hale he said that he would not seek today to secure action on the resolution. In making the inquiry Mr. Hale mentioned the probability of an early message from the President on the canal question and suggested the wisdom of deferring all action until it shall be received. Mr. Morgan spoke of the Panama road as "a legal fiction or an artificial entity to enable this country to avoid its responsibility as a common carrier." T# oVi/tnM nn? n laflf VA/lllMnff Ai. 

VUIIIJIOOO S11UU1U cuav/l MTT >OA(W**<tm the tearing up of the Panama railroad, Mr. Morgan said, no creditor could enjoin such & destruction. Mr. Morgan maintained that Mr. Cromwell, whose several connection* with the Panama government and the canal commission he enumerated, was the only one who benefited by this manner of managing the road. "It gives Cromwell absolute control of the road as if he was Its sole owner," he declared. Mr. Morgan advocated putting the railroad under the control of the canal commission, although with the control which the President exercised over this commission, he said, "any wild, arrogant man, who happens to be President, could inflict Incalculable Injury on the country." The blind confidence of the Secretary of War in the management of the road, he said, saved that official much trouble In superintending railroad matters. Mr. Morgan spoke for nearly two hours. He concluded with a statement that the Panama railway was the most reckless agency that ever assailed the treasury or the commercial interests of the United States. "Let the government of the United States no longer continue in the shipping business under the sea flag of a dummy corporation." He did not believe, he said, that the canal would be constructed in twenty-five years. When Senator Morgan concluded Senator Foraker immediately took the floor to call up his resolution regarding the discharge of negro troops, and he and Senator Penrose again engaged in a controversy over tha right of precedence on their respective resolutions.

Vice President Clark admitted en the stand that through him the railroad company furnished the money to men who bought the land and that they understood they were obtaining it from the government for the purpose of conveying it to the coal company. This proceeding, according to the decision In the case of the United States against the Trinidad Coal Company, was a direct violation of the law. Although taese transactions took place two rears ago, the deeds have not yet been placed on record. Upon thla showing It ia expected that proceedings will be Instituted to recover from the Union Pacific all of the lands thus fraudulently obtained from the govam m on Many Witnesses Called. The commission has been greatly assisted in its work by Independent coal operators who have suffered from the methods employed by the company. After meeting with defeat in their contests before the land department these operators turned over to the commission the evidence they had already presented to the land department. Following out the lines of inquiry suggested by this evidence, the counsel for trie commission nave put upon the rack many of the railroad employes concerned In the alleged conspiracy and dozens of the hirelings and tools used In the working out of the land grabbing scheme. To develop the disclosures concerning the methods by which the company secured declaratory statements the commission called a number of witnesses at Its hearing In Denver. One of these was Henry D. Teller an attorney and the notary public who took acknowledgment of persons signing most of the declarations. He Broke the Law. Teller was at the time chief clerk for Dorsey and Hodges, the senior partner of Which firm was attorney for the Union Pa clflo Railroad Company. Practically all of the acknowledgments were taken at the Union Paclftc depot In Denver in the office of the sales agent of the Union Pacific Coal Company, the coal company being owned by the railroad. Teller admitted that he did not awear any of the signers as the la-vf requires. He also admitted that the acknowledgments of the relinquishment*, which the men signed were left blank and were filled in later when they were placed on record at the land office at Evanston.

Some of the testimony follows: Q. Did not all the men sign relinquishments? A. I think they did. Q. They signed relinquishment* In blank? A. I think so. Q. And those blanks ars furnished by the land office here, are they not? A. I presume so. Q. All these men did In respect to the relinquishments was to sign at the bottom? A. Yes, sir. n Vnn trvr?

But subsequently wrpte In the 1st of July, lttOt? A. I wrote a subsequent date. O While the rettnaiiishment and ment were made on the same day, you certified that one was made on one day and the other on another day? A. Tea, str. Contrary to Law. Q. That act or yours was contrary to law, was It not? A. Tes, now I know It was. At the time I did not think anything about it. Since then I see it was a big mistake. Q. You were then a lawyer? A. Well, I had just been admitted to practice. Q You did not swear any of these men to the full declaratory statements? A. I do not remember swearing any. I just asked If they signed it of their own free wlU and accord. Q. Suppose, about any of these papers, that your certificate shows that you swore a man. what would be the fact as to what you did? A. The fact would be as I said. I do not remember that I gave any man the oath. Most of the declarations were taken In December, 1002, and the early months of 1603.

Many of them were Induced to sign by George Mossholder. a policy writer, and were taken to the depot in squads of from ten to twenty at a time. Mossholder and most of the others have drifted away from the city and cannot be found. In all about 160 signatures were secured. About a dozen signers were produced as witnesses before the commission. All of thesa continued Teller's statement that they were not sworn. Nearly all declared they did not know what they were signing. Thomas G-rigler said he thought he was signing a petition for some coal company's beneflt. Didn't Know What Her Signed. "I thought I was signing a petition to go to Washington." he said. Q. If a railroad wanted to get Into th? town they would have a petition signed, or If It wanted an office T A.

Did the whole twelve of you do the same thing when at the offloe of the coal company? A. I would not sit. but I thinir so. "We &11 went through the same form. Q.

The various witnesses Questioned regarding the declarations told practically the same story. Money Came From Black. J. W.

Black also made the sale to Clark for him, be entering Into an agreement through Judge Beard that when the land was transferred the debt to Black would be aettled. Vkoe President Clark, whan called as a witness, admitted frankly that persons who mad* cuh entry for the company did so with the understanding that the property was to be deeded to the company.

SANDING THE STREETS. Suggestions for Safety to Kan and Beast in Freezing Weather. Mr. C. A. Snow, president of the Humane Society of the District, has forwarded a letter to the Commissioners, In which he recites that "at a recent meeting of the executive committee of the Washington Hu- 1 mane Society a resolution was passed to petition the Commissioners to consider the reasiointy or sanding tne sireeto 01 vvaonlngton In sleety or Icy weather, and especially inviting your attention to the steeper hills of 14th and 16th streets, Connecticut avenue northwest and Capitol Hill." "It li well known, said Mr. 8now, "that there Is frequently during the winter season a sudden fall of sleet or of rain which freezes when it falls on the colder surface of the streets, making them dangerous and almost impassable for draft horses, eepecially for those that have not been recently or specially shod. This condition often catches the delivery wagons of milkmen, butdhers and grocers en route, when it would hurt their business and seriously Inoommode their patrons to attempt to have the shoee of their horses sharpened or roughed before completing their deliveries. Moreover, on these occasions the smlthshopa *re overcrowded with horses waiting to be treated, thus greatly increasing the delay. 'T? ? nif. 11m ' A.-M 4k. ? Xfc l? 0UgBt3Olt?U

This would certainly be a humane and probably an economical expedient. It would in a measure prevent the wear of the streets from the chipping by the toes and calks of sharpened and hardened horse shoes. The streets of the city would doubtiees wear longer If It were not for the custom of sharpening horseshoes In order that the animal may gat a hold on the street, which he. of course, cannot do without Indenting and abrading the surface."

OPPOSED TO SECRECY SPOOHSB WANTS ALL FACTS AS TO BLAHKET DISCHARGE. Lata this afternoon the resolutions calling for information regarding the recant dismissal of a negro battalion from the army cam* up In the Senate. Immediately there was rivalry between Senator Penrose and Senator ForaJter aa to the character of the reeolutlon to be adopted. Senator Penrose's resolution merely request! the President to submit to the Senate information, leaving it to the discretion of the President to send aa little or aa nuiKh h* fit Senator Foraker's resolution on the other hand directs the Secretary of War to send to the Senate all Information and correspondence as well as all laws bearing on the case. Senator Spooner first addressed the Senate. He said his remarks would be directed entirely to the form of the resolution. He declared that he would be much disappointed if the Senate should pass the Penrose resolution, which might give the impression that thn Senate was approaching mr ituujwi m ir n aia noi nave a ngnt to know all about It. He said it was apparent, of course, ttiat In addressing a resolution to the State Department, dealing with International questions, it might be left to the discretion of the executive branch to transmit to the legislative branch such information as thought discreet to send. In time of war the fame thing would apply to the War and Navy departments. He realised also that the Department of Justice should be given discretion as to sending the results of Its legal investigations to be made public. But in the case under discussion there should be no secrocy whatever. The question is altogether one of the organization of the army In time of peace, one of purely domestic business, about which Congress has a perfect right to be fully informed. Senator Bpooner stated that ho was opposed to the resolution In the form In which it had been offered by Senator Penrose because it was a domestic matter, and he did not think it necessary to Include the words "If not incompatible with the public Interests" in such a resolution. For that reason he was opposed to the Penrose resolution.vat Id iavor of the Foraker resolution. Senator Foraker' explained that his own resolution calls upon the Secretary of War only for Information which the resolution specifically described.

TUs iiMUctruont was read by the district ntti>rn?v nn.l fr? a cool, deliberate voice, but with eye* flashing deflnanee at the array of counsel for the prosecution, Mrs. Blrdsong replied: "Not guilty." Two days were consumed In selecting twelve men who will decide whether Mra. Blrdsong was Justified In slaying her former physician and Intimate frleVui. Thin attorneys, among them being the ablest counsel In the commonwealth, battled twenty hour* over the selection of the Jury. Judge Miller announced adjournment of tuuri unxu tomorrow morning, WUen lha state will open Its case. A woman of striking beauty,, refined and accomplished. Mrs. Blrdsong presented an unusual picture as she ent?r?d tine court room yesterday and took a seat among the brilliant lawyers retained for- the defense. She was quietly but stylishly dressed and her air of calmness and self-possession astonished the crowd. On the right sat her uncle. United States Senator A. J. McLaurln, who Is directing fh..

They all will tak? an active part In the defense. Assistant District Attorney Greaves, A. H. Longino, a cousin of the murdered man; A. C. McNalr of Brookhaven; K. P.

Much spirit and bitterness will be added to the fight by reason of tlie fact that nearly all the attorneys are blood relatives of the accused woman and the man she killed. Spirit Not Broken. While her spirit has not been broken by the nervous ordeal through which she has passed alnce the tragedy In the little village of Montlcello one year ago. Mr*. Birdsong has the appearance of a woman who has endured much mental suffering. Her complexion has lost Its rosy tint. and. although only twenty-two years of aire, she has the look of a woman tn the thirties. Her two children, aged six and four year*, accompanied her Into the court room and took seats at her side. Her husband. Dr. E. H. Blrdsong, under lndlotraent for complicity In the killing, oocuplel a seat with the group of attorneys. The facta of the killing are not In dispute.

Two shots were fired Inside the office, Mrs. Blrdsong retreating to the street and her victim following. As he staggered to the little gallery In front of the office the - , third shqt was flred and the physician fell desLd on the pavement. Mrs. Blrdsong then handed her weapon to a passerby and calmly returned home. Two Versions of Affair. Sixty witnesses have been summoned, a majority of the number for the purpose of giving testimony concerning the relations that had existed between Or. Butler and Mrs. Blrdsong. The prosecution win endeavor to show thai Intimacy had been one of long standing and that Mrs. Bird- ? song had tr!?->d to persuade the physician to ?lope with her. which he refused to do. On the other hand, the defense will seek to prove that Dr. Butler placed her under the influence of morphine and seduced her; that when she recovered from the effects >f the drug and realized what had happened, without consultation with husband Dr friends she went Immediately to Dr. Butler's office for tho purpose of killing him. Dr. Butler was about forty years of age. a. bachelor, enjoyed a large practice and liijjii siiiii'jiuK in ins prott-asiun. rcis family. like the Blrdsongs, 1b extensively connected by blood and marriage with the foremost families of the state.

She Is an accomplished horsewoman. of splendid marksmanship and fond of all outdoor sports. In event of a conviction and appeal to the " ' supreme court a peculiar complication will result, as Attorney General Williams, who Is required to conduct prosecutions before that tribunal, is also a cousin of Mrs Blrdsong. He will be compelled to conduct the case himself or yield his duties to the special counsel employed. 3ENERAL AND PERSONAL NEWS OF GEORGETOWN ????
