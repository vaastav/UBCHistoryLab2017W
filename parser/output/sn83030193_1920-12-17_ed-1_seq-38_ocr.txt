UNTERMYER 'AND MR. GRACE. A STRIKING SCENE in the world drama of industrialism was staged in the Aldermanic Chamber Wednesday when Samuel Untcrmycr in terroaied Eugene P. Grace. .Mr. Grace is President of "Bethlehem." Mr. Untermyer is the largest single stockholder. Mr. Untsrmyer advocated collective bargaining ' and unionization of workmen. Mr. Grace is willing to go to any length in op position to these principles. In this conflict of opinion, if we go beneath the surface, we find one of the great basic factors of modern industrial life. Mr. Untermyer typifies ownership of industry. Mr. Grace typifies man agement. The two do not always agree. If Mr. Untermyer owned and managed one or more of the Bethlehem plants or subsidiaries, it is fair to suppose that he would put into effect the policies lie advocates. He would be in touch with his labor forces, would know what his workers wanted and would probably grant what was asked without the need of an elaborate union organization. Instead, Mr. Untermyer merely owns a fraction of all the. plants. He manages none. If he disap proves of Mr. Grace's- management he is helpless uness he can persuade a majority of the ownership to cither discharge Mr. Grace or force him to change his policy. Mr. Grace is the representative of a union of employing capitalists. These capitalists are out of touch with the labor they employ. Hie workers have no avenue to reach the humanitarian instincts of the real employers, such as Mr. Untermyer. Mr. Grace stand's in- the way. When every owner was his own employment manager there was real competition in employment Each owner had to treat his employees fairly or they would go to a competitor. He was In pos ' tion to know whether the treatment was fair. The corporation the union of capitalist employ ersmade the union of employees essential. 'Hie Very conflict between Mr. Untermyer and his Hired Man, Mr. Grace, is itself one of the best reasons a labor organizer could advance to justify the unionization 8f labor for 'the purpose of collect ive bargaining.

BURGLARY AND BANDITRY. BURGLARY and banditry have flouiished this week. So much so thait seems evident no working agreement between the police and the un derworld exists. Of late we have heard frequently, that the "crime .wave" is a pure figment of the Imagination. If burglars and bandits were friendly with Com missioner Enright, they would have taken a short holiday to help him prove his contention. But they have not. Instead, the crime record forms an almost ironi cal commentary on the 'Enright statement. The burglars and bandits seem bent on proving the Commissioner in error. i' According to Commissioner K.nrlslit'B own BUtMiyoat, moro than oiie-sovenlh of tho pollcotnou voted "No'' on tho pollen hospital question In splto of "orders from Headquar ter." Thin Is a striking commentary on olthor . the courage or tho acumen a( the foreo. KltUer this minority could not ho Intimidated or olse they decided that Enright In no nearly "through" that his disapproval will not amount to much. NAILING ANOTHER. DA-' l-J tAiy tit iconoclastic statesmen at Geneva cotttiniK to tear down the structure of false hood laboriously built up by Chairman Hays and . nb anii-League propagandists. Hr.'t, a committee of the Assembly officially ex posed the baseless fabrication about Article X. that, villy-nilly, .our country would be dragged into esajy back aljey row in Europe. Tr.en, by tlieir independence, the British domln Ions torpedoed the "six to one" lie that had sailed so serenely through the campaign, piloted by Chief .Navigator Johnson or was it Mariner Reed? As for the wny the League would conspire to suppress Irish"fre;dom, the correspondents in Switz erland must have been remiss, for they have not yet reported any retolution calling on member nations hW io wiana'saM in quel irur the rish revolt. 1 laisenqoasnone more bnuenly outraged truth and decency than the asser tion that the League condoned and even sponsored the white slave traffic. And now the Asiembly has unanimously voted to summon an international conference to draft a world-wide convention looking to the prevention of the traffic in women. One more Anti-League lie nailed and clinched.. PENROSE POINTS TO THE SOURCE! SENATOR BOIES PENROSE, one of the big gest Republican bosses that ever dictated party policy in or'but of Congress, now steps forward to warn the country against impending doom. "The situation," declares the Senator, "is appall ing. It cannot be exaggerated. We are rapidly reaching the point where men must sit down in the cold light of reason, without any illusions, and reach a solid basis. We cannot continue for, many months to go on as we have been doing." "Perhaps tho principal source of all the Ills which are llkoly soon to break, over the country Is overtaxation.- "Prompt reltet must be afforded by Con gress." Is Senator Penrose prepared to explain why a Republican Congress could not have afforded some of this relief during the past two years? If the country was being overtaxed, the remedy wuld come only from Congress, and Congress was controlled by Senator Penrose's party. Why didn'i'the Senator from Pennsylvania and his Republican confreres sit down "in the cold light of reason, and without any illusions," to determine how they might best serve their country when tliis Sixty-sixth Congress met a year ago? Why didn't they listen in a spirit of patriotic help fulness to the President's message to Congress in December, 1919, in which lie laid stress on the "immediate necessity" for tax revision and on the peril of continuing taxes which "discourage energy ( and remove the incentive to new enterprise"? Senator Penrose lays the present ills of business to overtaxation. Who is to blame for the overtaxation if not Sen ator Penrose and oilier dictators of the Republican Party who refused to sanction any programme of tax relief until they had capitalized their country's need to help elect a Republican President? That is the Republican record of patriotism dur ing the period when the American people were suf fering for want of reconstructive aid from their National Legislature. It is "a record which Senator Penrose cannot blot out, though he shed rivers of crocodile tears over perils that now threaten.. All these months of vain wailing for tax revision in order that a' Penrose may mount the platform of secure Republican victory, tell the Nation it is over taxedand try to persuade it Us best hope lies in a new protective tariff I The hypocrisy of It I - 

TWICE OVERS. i C TAN UARY 9th, 1857. After three years of ex J penstee mar the balance-sheet exhibited such a state of wealth and prosperity as may Well make us 'the enty of surrounding nations'; but while we hate recoc ' ered the great blessing of peace, wehatelolookbackupon a year stained bcyoiiS all precedent with frightful crimes of eeery sort and kind; horrible murders, enormous frauds, and scandalous robberies and defalcations. The whole attention of the country Is now drawn to the social questions which press upon us with appalling urgency, and the next session of Parliament, which Is rapidly advancing, must be principally engaged In the endeavor to find remedies for the cells and dangers Incident to our corrupted population, and our erroneous and Inade quate penal system, the cells and dangers of which threaten to become greater and more difficult to remedy etery day."
