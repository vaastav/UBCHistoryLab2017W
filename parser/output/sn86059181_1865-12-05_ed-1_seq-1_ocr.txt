On motion, a Committee of Seven was appointed, consisting of Mr. Stevens of Pennsylvania, Kaymond of New York, Spaulding of Ohio, Wasbbarne of llli nois, Payne of Wisconsin, Boutwell of Massachusetts, and Blair of Maine, who reported tbe following resolution: Raolved, By the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States, in Congress assembled, that a committee of fifteen members shall be appointed, nine of whom shall be members of the House and six of tbe Senate, who shall inquire into the condition of the States which formed the so called Confederate States of America, and report whether tbey or any of them are entitled to be represented in either House of Congress, with leave to report at any time, by bill or otherwise; and nntil such report shall have been made and nnally acted on by Congress, no member shall be received into either House from any so-called Confederate States, and all papers re lating to Representatives of said States shall be referred to said committee with out debate.

The vote for Doorkeeper was: Goode now, of New York, sixty six; and for Hawkins Taylor, of Kansas, fifty-eight Mr. Goodenow having received the high est number of votes, his nomination was made unanimous. CcL Gavin, of Ohio, was selected as a candidate for Postmaster, in the place of tbe present Incumbent, Mr. King.

Tbe Democratic members of Congress, to the number of twenty-five or thirtv. held a caucus to-night in the room of the Committee on the Judiciary. Hon. Mr. Winfield wis President, and Hon. Samuel J. Randall was chosen Secretarv They had an interchange of views, and decided to hold an adjourned meeting? on Monday morning, at ten o'clock, to nominate candidates in opposition to those of the Republicans. : k Snort Speech by Mr- Colfax Hon. Mr. Cessna, Chairman of the Pennsylvania Union State Committee, in company with about twenty members of it, called upon Hon. Schuyler Colfax to night, and presented tbe resolutions which had been vnanimously adopted by the committee, approving the sentiments enunciated in bis speecn ueiiverea in Washington three weeks ago. . . , Mr. Cessna, in tbe eourse of his re marks, said they had watched the course of Mr. Colfax in Congress with a great deal of interest and confidence, and ex pressed gratification that it was indorsed by his fellow members, and that be was destined again to fill the Speaker's chair, the duties of which he bad dis charged with so much efficiency and noDularitv.. Mr. Colfax, in reply, said the regard and confidence of his own constituents were always highly prized and appre ciated bv bim: but when the represent atives of the Union party of a' great State like that of Pennsylvania tendered such hearty manifestations of approval, there was additional canse of gratitude and thankfulness. In 1564. at tbe time the soil of the Republic was shaken by tbe tread of contending armies, and tbe defenders of tbe Union cause encoun tered all the prejudices growing out of taxation, accumulating debt, and tbe draft filled the hearts of every person: when the great State of Pennsylvania gave ber electoral votes for tbe distin guished patriots, Lincoln and Johnson, and again this morning, when Pennsyl vania, with the adjoining States cf New York and New Jersey, re-affirmed so decisively their attachment to the great cause, it gave renewed hope to all those who had been faithful to the Union in its peril. Mr. Colfax said in conclusion that the soldiers of the Republic had done their share in the great work of putting down the rebellion, and the spirit which ani mated it now remained for the Senators and Representatives of the people with statesmanship and fileiity to the Union and to tbe principles of liberty and hu manity to complete tbe work now in trusted to their bands. He rejoiced that every indication gave promise that they would shoulder to shoulder unite inflexibly in tbs path of du ty.
