To the Senate and House of Representa tives : In transmitting to you rov fourth annua] message, it ie with thankfulness to the Giver ot all good that as a na tion we have been blessed for the last year with peace at home and abroad and a general prosperity vouchsa'ed to but few people. With the exception of the recent devastating fire which swept Irom earth with a breath, as it were, million* of accumulated wealth in the city of Boston, there has been no over shadowing calamity within the year to record. It is gratifying to note how, like i heir tellow citizens of the city of Chicago under similar circumstances a year earlier, the citizens of Boston are rallying under their misfortunes, arul the prospect is that their energy and pei severance will overcome all obsta cles and show the same prosperity soon that they would have shown had no disaster befallen them. Otherwise we have been free front pesilet.ce, war and calamity which olten overtake nations, and as tar as known judgment can penetrate the luture no cause seems to fX'st to threaten our present peace.

ALABAMA CLAIMS. When Congress adjourned in .Tune last a question had been raised by Great Britain and was pending, which tor a time seriously imperilled a settlement by friendly arbtration. Tne difference existing between this Government and tLat ot Her Britaniv Maj*?iv by the treatv of Washington, had been refrred to the tribunal of arbitra tion which had met at Geneva, in Switz erland. The arbitrators, however, dis posed ot the question which hud jeop ardize! the whole of the treaty and threatened to involve the two nations in unfriendly relations, in a manner en tirely satisfactory to this Government and in a coincidence wiih the views and the policy which it had maintained The tribunal which convened in Geneva in December concluded i's laborious session on the 14 h day of September la?t, on which day, having availed it sell of the discretionary power given to it by the treaty to award a sum in gross, it made i s decision, whereby it awarded the sum of f 15,51)0,000 in gold as the in den.nity to be i>aid by Great Britain to the United States, for the satislactiou Ot all claims referred to its consider ation. This decision happily disposes of a long standing diflerence between she two Governments, and in connec t'ou with another award by t!>e German Emperor, under a re'erence to him by the same treaty, leaves these two Gov ernments without a shadow upon the riendly relations which, it ie my sin cere hope, mav tor everremam equally unclouded. Ti e report of the agent o' the United States, appointed to attend the German tribunal, accompanied by the protocol of the proceedings of the arbitrators, the argument of ihe counsel ot both Governments, the award ot the tribunal, ai d opinion given by the sev eral arbitrators, is trai smuted here with I have caused to be communi cated to the heads of the friendly pow ers, who complied with the joint request made to them under the treaty the ihanks of this Government for the appointment of arbitrators made bv them respectively, and also my thanks to th?f eminent personages named by them and my thanks for the dignity, rft'ience, impartiality and great ability with which they discha ged their arduous and high functions, lier Mai' sty's Government has communi cated to me its appreciation by Her Majesty of the ability and ltide'atigable industry displayed by Mr. Adams, the arbitrator, named on the part ot this Government during the protracted in quiries and discuss ons of the tribunal. I cordially unite with Her Majesty in this appreciation. It is due to the aoentot the United States before the tribunal to record my high appreciation (,f the marked ability, unwearied pa tience and the prudence and discretion with w'lich be has conducted the very responsible and delicate dufes com mitted to him, as it is also due to the learned and eminent rcunsel who attended the tribunal on the part of this government, to express inv sense of tne talents and wisdom which thev- brought to bear ;n the ar gument o' the result so happily reach ed It will be the province ot ' -on*re*e ,o provide for the distribution, among those who may be ent tied to tt of their shares of money to be ptid, although the sum awarded is not payable until a vear from the date ot the award It is deemed advisable that no time be lost in making a proper examination of hr several cases in which indemnity may be due, and I consequently recommend the creation of a bovrdot commission ers for the purpose, bv tourth articles ot the Treaty of Wash ington. TI1B SAN JCAK BOCNDABT. The respective c'aims of the Uuiled Stales and Great Britain in their con struction of the treaty of the loih ol ?June, defining the bou:idarv line between their respective territories w?-re submitted to the arbitration and award of His Majesty theEmperorof Ger many to decide which of tho^e claims is moat in accordance with the true in terpretation of the treaty of 1846 Hi* Majesty the Emperor of Germany hav in>r been pleaded to uodertake the ar bitration , has the earnest thanks of this irovemment and of the people of the United States lor th? labor, pains and care which be Las devoted to the consideration of thia long pending dif ference. I have caused an expression of my earnest thank* to be communica ted to his Majesty. Mr. Bancroft, the representative of this government at Berlin, conducted the case and pre pnrrd the statement on the pari of the United States with the ability that bis pisi services justified the public in ex pectin* at hia bands Am a member of the Cabinet at the data o/ the treaty which has given rife to the discussion between the two government''; as the Minister to Great Britain when the construction now pronounced un'ounded was first advanced and as the agent and representative of the- government to prosecute the case and receive the award, he has been associated with the queston in ail its phases, and in everJ stage lias manifested a patriotic zeal and earnestness in the maintenance of the claim of the Uuited States. He is en* tit led to much credit for euch untiring attention. Alter a patient investigation of the case and of the statements of eat h party, his Majesty the E-nperor of Germany, on the 21st of October last, t-igned his award in writ ing, deciding that the claim of the Gov ernment of the United States that the boum'a^y 1 y i i ? g bitween the territories of tier Britanic Majesty and the United States should be drawn through the Hnro channel, is most in accordance with the true interpreta'ion of '.he treaty concluded on the 15th' o* June, between the a^ent of her Majesty, and ttie United States Copies, ot the case were presented on behalf of each gov efnment, and a statement in reply of each, and notations of the award are transmitted herewith. This award con firms the United States in the claim to the imp. riant archipelatro of islands lying between the continent and Van couvers Island, whicti 'or twenty-S'X years since t ii c ratification of the "trea-y, Great Britain has contested, and ieaves us 'or the first time in the history of the United States as a na tion without a question of disputed territory. It is a uratelul duty to ac knowledge the prompt and spontaneous action o: Her Majesty'? Government in giving effect to the award in antici pation ot anv request from this Gov trnment, ami belure the reception in the United States of the award signed by the Emperor, Her Majesty had given instructions for the removal ot the troop? which had been stationed there, and for the cessation o! all exercise or claim o< jurisdiction, so a- to leave the United States in exclu sive possession of the lately dispute territory. 1 am grateful to be aols to announce that the orders for the re moval of troops have been executed, and the military joint occupation of ?an Juan has ceased. The Islands are now in the exclusive pisses-ion of the U mted States. It tow becomes neceesiry to complete the eurvev and determination of thai pjrt-on ot the boundary line through the Hani Channel, upon w-ich the Commission which determined the remaining part of the line were unable to at;ree. 1 recommend the appoint ment of a Commission to act j .ii.tiy with one which may be name i '.v Her Majesty for that purpose, Ex perience of the difficulties attending the determination ot our admitted line c I boundary a'ter the occupation of the territot v and its settlement by those owing allegiance to the respective Gov ernments. points to the importance of est*b isliing, bv natural objects or other territory acquired by purcnase from Russia and the adjoining pas-essions o Her Majesty. The region is now so sparsely occupied that no conflicting interests of individuals or o jurisdict o-. is likelv to interfere to the delay or em - hanassment of the actual ;|>canon of the line It deferred until popula tion shall enter and occupv the lern torv, some trivial contest of neighbors may again array the two Governments in antagonism. I therefore recommend the appointment of a jointly with ore that may be appointed on the part of Great Britaiu to deter mine the line between our territory ^f Alaska and the coterminous possession of Great Br tain. THK FISI1RRY QUESTION. In my las'. message 1 recommended the legislation nece sary on the part of ihe United States to bring into opera tion tbe aricles of the treaty of Wash ington of May, 1871, relating to the fisheries and to other matters touching tbe rela'ions of the United States toward the British North American possessions, to become operative so soon as I lie proper legislation should be bad on the part o) Great Britain and her possessions, wh ch bad not then been i>ad. Dumi g the session of Congress a question was raised, which, for the first time, created a doubt whether any ac? tion by Congress in this direction indi cated would become imperative This question bas since been disposed o', and I have received notice that the Imperial Parliament and Legislature of the Provincial Government have passed laws to carrv these provision of the treaty ou this matters relerred to into operation. I therefore recommend your early adoption of the legislature in the same direction necessary on the part of this Government. THE BOUNDARY COMMISSION. The Government Tom mission for determining the boundary line between the Unite.! .States ami the British Pro vince between the Lake of the Wools and the Rooky Mountains have organ ized and entered upon its work, h is desirable that the foroe be increased in order that tiie completion o. thesurvev and the determination ol the line may be reached. To that end I recommend a sufficient appropriation be made. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. With France, our earliest ally, and Russia, the constant and steady frierd j of this government and people, we have many causes oi friendship and many common sympathies, and with the other powers ol Europe our relations are maintained on the most friendly terms Since my last message the an nouncement has been made ol the rati fi ation of a treaty with the Austrian and Hungarian Empire relating to nat uralization, also of a treaty with the German Empire respecting Consuls and trade marks, also of a treaty with Sweden relating to na'uraliz ition, all of which trraties have been duly pro claimed.

A large number of people visited the house all day yesterday expecting the body would be laid in state, but none were admitted pave a few frie&d* and relations. The remains of the dead philosopher reclined in the black cloth covered casket, in the rear part of the house, with a temple of white flowers at the head and fljwerv testimonials of loving hands scattered ever the pal. The tace looked as noble and gentle as in life; the eyes were closed as calmly and the lines about the mouth were drawn as peacefully as in sleep. The broad forehead was smooth and polinh ed. As in most cases, the face is as yet unpinched. The coffin is of solid chest nut wood, covered with Mack cloth. The trustees of the Tribune have ar ranged lor the funeral to take place on Wednesday, at eleven o'clock, from the the Church of the Divine Paternity, corner of Fourth and Sixth streets. No special iuvitations will be sent out, but it is known that organizations o' various kinds are taking formal steps for attending in a body. The remains will lie in siate throughout to-morrow at such place as shall be announced in to-morrow morning's papers.

Special Telegram to the Commercial.] New Yokk, December 1. ? Mr. Gree lev's remains were brought to the city last night, accompanied bj hishtflcted (laughters, and deposited in Mr. Sin clair's residence, West Forty-ninth street. II undreds of old friends applied for admittance to day, but a policeman at the door allowed no visitors to pass A large number of societies have resolved to attend the funeral, and others meet to-morrow to take similar action. If the Common Council to-morrow desire that the remains shall lie in state in City Hall, they will be conveyed there, and thence on Tuesday to Dr Chapin's Church. Otherwise they will be taken to the church to morrow from Mr. Sinclair's hou?e. and l<e in state there, with a guard of honor Mr. Greeley will be burieH in Green wood, where his wife, two little bojs, aged respectively six and five years, and bis intant daughter art interred. Toe orphan daughters are at Mr. S nclair's he use, cared for by affectionate friends They are as well in health as could be hoped for considering tbeir at most crushing sorrows. Dr. Cbapin preached an eloquent sermon this moraine on the subject o' Mr Greeley's lite, taking his text from St. Jobn xvii, 9. Speaking of Mr. Greeley's connection with that churcb, he said: "Deceased was not a mere fair-weather Christian, but a sympa thetic laborer and active in charitable and denominational work." Every aeat in the church was occupied except Mr. Greeley's pew. During the die course the congregation repeatedly gave way to tears. At Stein way Hall Bar. Or. Hepwortk delivered a eulogy on Mr. Greeley's i e&reer u * public man. He said the great editor desired 'o be President only to reform glaring evils that have ap peared in our form of govern merit. Henry Ward Beecher preached to night about Mr. Greeley's death, to an immense congregation, which was deep ly and visibly affected. His text was [ Lake xvi, 8. Mr. Beecher praised Mr. Greeley's noble traits of character, and avowed that he had always love J the illustrious editor. In his old age he bad fallen upon stormy days, and ; die4 literally of a broken heart. Hon. Isaiah T. Williams, Mr. Gree ley's Iriend and counsel, gives the fol lowing history of his mental condition j after the first great reverse to the Union army in 1861 : "It was on Sunday morning, after the j first battle of Bull Run. 1 was then j living at 48 West Sixteenth street, New ) York. Mr. Greeley called at my house j very early in the morning. I opened j the door and he walked into the parlor. I noticed that he was very melancholy. There was Done of his usual vivacity. I knew what the trouble wa?, and re strained from mentioning our defeat, hoping fo distract his thoughts He said little or nothing; he seemed ab sorbed in thought. In about an hour the breakfast bell rang, and we walked into breakfast. The same depression continued ; he sat with his head bowed and said nothing, refusing to eat for about ten minutes. Then he sail, in bis usual pleasant voice, 'Can I go to vour study ami lie down.' I re plied yes. And he went out I found him there a few minutes later, and saw that he was suffering intense mental anguish. I rallied him on his melan choly, and he looked up at me, and eaid, 'I fear al! is lost The country is gone.' I endeavored to cheer hi in, bat it Feemed impossible to rally him 1 felt that his heart had been crushed Once in a while he exclaitmd, 'On, oh, oh, the country is gone.' I agiin en deavored to console him and to distract his thoughts. I sent for I-aac Sher man, also a personal Iriend of Mr. Greeley, ami we converged cheer fully in h's presence about the defeat, taking the most hop-'ul view of affairs until dinner time. We ail went to dinner, but Mr Greeley ate nothing. I advised bim to take a cup of tea, but he refused. Sometimes when weak and nervous he would drink a cup of weak tea, and felt better a terward He left the table before dinner was over, and sat in the parlor. In thp afternoon sune more'oi his friends called, and I called a coach and we took a ride through the Park. That night Mr. Greeley went to his lodgings. I called on him next day and found him little ilanv better. I advised him togotoChappaqua and takecountry air. He went up there and remained three weeks. John C. Ferguson went with him. For several d.*ys he did not sleep fiiteen mirutes at a time. Mr. Ferguson would walk out with him and kepp him out until he became exhaust ed, then he would ;!eep a few minutes, and in thet way he finally regained his normal condition. On the seventeenth da_v he returned to New York, greatly benefited, and peopleof the city thought Mr Greeley had been only ordinarily ill." ThpFntnrr of llix Mhi-rnl Rrpnhll rnn Parly? l.fllrr from ih?> mill of the .NhiIuohi Commit Ire. The following letter in reg trd to the futare of the Liberal Republican party, addressed to Jacob R. Ree^e, editor ot the Trenton (X. J ) State Sentinel haw juat been received ; "New York, Not. 23, 1872. "Mt Dear Sir : ? I have your* of the 8th inst.. asking from me the intention* of the 'National Committee' with refer ence to the future of the Liberal Re publican party. It Heeros to me that time onlv can fully answer your ques tion. Circumstance* must deiermine our future. Id my own judgment we have made a gallant fi_?ht, which miv yet prove to be the skirmish preceding a great victory. W e were de'eat-d be cauee no great issues divided the political parties, a"d mere personal arguments were not sufficient to bring out the pop u!ar vote or to cau*e a change of ail ministration. We made a platform at Cincinnati looking to certain reform*. At Philadelphia the Republicans adopted substantially the same plat form and narrowed tile fight to one of men, not principles. There being then nothing more important than individual political inteiests at stake the moneyed interests of the country were thrown with the party in powpr and against any change, and thus at the beginning the heaviest artillery was placed against us. United to this the Democracy were apathetic; at first, because no vital principle awakened an interest in the contest, and, second, because years of hostility to Mr. Greeley begat indifference in an encounter merely personal between him and General Grant. We did not fail be cause our nominee whs unpopular, for I to-day believe that no man in the United Sta'es can boast of so many personal friends as Horace Oreelev, and no one lives who is more beloved or es teemed than he for a character princely in its unse'fish regard and its loyalty to every moral law wnich governs human conduct It is true thai in the heat ot an angry contest he was calumniated and misrepresented, but all such at? tacks were made only by the miserable gadflies that skim over the sound and healthy flesh of the body to find some festering pimple to assiil and feed uf-on We failed because we were engage! in a combat not vitalized by any is.-ue suf ficient to mhke a distinct line bttween friend and foe. "It is yet too sood to deiermine as to the future. It General Grant tathfully carries oat the pledges of his party, which are substantially the same a* those made br the Liberals at Cincin nati, be may be the real, thon.'b not to as the accepted, agent of re'orm. It Gene/al Grant carries out the roea-ures of our party, consistency. ?( nothing else, nay compel oar approval. We cannot bosestly a-sail him it he doc tor the nation that which we claim to be right. It remains to be seen what General Grant will do in this direction. He has began well in the civil serv ce line in Philadelphia. Will he continue on this road ot reform ? If so, we mast ftpplaad kirn. If be dot* not, we mail resist like honest men who claim to battle for the public good. "When Congress meet* I presume 'the leadeisof our party ? Messrs. Sum ; ner, Trumbull, S'huri, Tipton, and the many others in the two bouses ? will 'point the way' before us. It would be I premature and imorudent to indicate ( any course till these able and honest , men have had lime and opportunity to I speak. The Liberal Republicans can : do no better than to be passive (or the j | present and to watch events. If we ; hare forced the enemy, in self-defense, I to adopt our own code of political , I morals, then we have alreadv won the j victory, even tboagh other hands than those which we would have chosen exe cute the reform. But if the party in power prove by their recreancy that the vows made in the storm are to be broken in the sunshine, then it will be in order to send every Liberal Republican again to his proper place to prove by future efforts that the Liberal victory has in truth been only postponed.
