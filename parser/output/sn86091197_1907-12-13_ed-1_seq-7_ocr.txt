F» tSl S i i il tffc lia g B. (The flotmlter.) | President Roosevelt's annual mee page to Congress, delivered last * TJuesday, epvera so much space that Rn can be digested by piecemeal and the painstaking reviewer, will give time to the task. It contains about >; 40,000 words, some of the topics be . lng elaborated upon through quota tions from previous public messages | by the President. 1 money stringency is referred to and . the people are expostulated with for ^hoarding their money, Instead of Rplacing it In sound banks. The Presl If.dent says it "is hoarding that is the ^Immediate cause of the money strin glgency." He admits that there are 'gome dishonest men at the bottom of '■'The trouble, some unscrupulous and l^reckleBB men, and he still believes igjthat they ought to be punished. It is the opinion of the President Vihat the country has not departed S*rom its period of prosperity. vMils connection he discusses the sub feet of swollen fortunes, amassed through corporate organizations, and (repeats his recommendations of a fl»ear ago in relation to their regula : cion and control by the general gov ■ -fcTnment. g| Again he says nothing can be done ^through the action of the States to Rbate the evils of corporate exist ence—the sovreignty of the general wgovernment must be asserted. The ^control of Interstate commerce, too, he declares, is a function of the gen eral government, designated as such J>y the founders of the Constitution, who made ample provision for cen tralized supervision. Mr. Roosevelt does not look upon himself as an ad vocate of centralization. As to the railroads, it is his judg ment that there should be created a National incorporation act or a law authorizing the general government to license the railroad corporations. "Unless the National Government as sumes proper control of Interstate commerce In the exercise of the au thority it already possesses," he says, "it will be well nigh impossible gither to give or to get from the .railroad full justice." The President asks for additional legislation for the control of busi ness corporations engaged in inter state commerce, repeating what he has said before, that it unwise and futile to attempt to destroy combina tions in trade or production. Cor porations and labor unions have come to stay and it remains only to provide adequately for their manage ment. He says there are combina tions that do good and combinations ■ that do evil. The bad ones should ■ be regulated and the good ones en ■ couraged. I £ He asks for necessary amendments to the anti-trust law. It should not be repealed, he says, but it should be made "more efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions." He frowns upon the monopolistic corporations and declares that they .ought not to be permitted to engage in business. A National charter sys tem and publicity are his remedies, and these, he believes, do not con template centralization. ITr. Roosevelt deplores the cur rency system and says there are de fects in the laws that cause all com mercial interests to suffer, especial ly during the recurring crop moving periods. Like other economists, he f recognizes the greater need of elas ticity, but does not urge any special plan. Bankers' associations, he says have made suggestions that may be worthy of consideration. Altogether, the President offers no solution of the problem, but says something must be done . To the protective tariff principle he again commits himself and his party and says no change in principle he made with wisdom.* Still he is of the opinion that, once in about a dozen years, the tariff law should he carefully th .Ai-Ur-** • % The existing In - <*,an scrutinized to se^* if ere is anything injurious in their This should be done, he a Presidential operation. argues, not before election, but imemdiately after such Until 1908-9 he is a Stand Then the subject may be election, patter. judiciously delt with, by his permis sion. The President declares in favor of incom tax and an inheritance tax, "In my judgment both of taxes should be part of our an saying, these system of Federal taxation. On the subject of the abuse of the injunction in connection with labor troubles, the President indicates he has nearly caught up with that advanced thought, in spite of his partisan environment. "I earnestly commend to the atten tion of Congress this matter, so that some way may be devised which will limit the abuse of injunctions and protect those rights which it from to time unwarrantly invades." As Mr. Taft, charged with being one fathers of the abuse, is far He says: time , of the away, he cannot immediately pro tost* In connection with the labor sub ject, he advises Congress to extend the provisions of the eight- hour law and r dfiW s his rsoommeiidittoa that Congress provide for tho oompulsory Investigate* q( Industrial eontrover sides in (mn whore mod lotion folia and arbitration la refected. The work of the Agricultural De partment of the Government la strongly commended, discussed at considerable length and the mission of the soll-tlller given the recogni tion that his importance demands. All that is said in lta favor the de partment baa earned. Inland waterways, forest conser vation, reclamation, the protection of agricultural and mineral lands, the rights of home-seekers over specula tors and the many abuses that have reduced the public domain are treat ed exhaustively and in the right spirit and there are no more impor tant topics within the purview of his recommendations. The message advises the creation of postal savings banks and the ex tension of parcel post privilege to rural routes, which, It says, serve 15,000,000 people. • On the subject of funds for cam paign expenses, the President makes a new suggestion. He believes that Congress might with propriety ap propriate enough money for the le gitimate expenses of each of the great National parties, enough mon ey to meet the cost of organization, with the stipulation that the party receiving money from the National treasury should accept no more than a fixed amount from any individual All receipts and expendi donor. tures to be made public and corpo rations prohibited from contribut ing. Recommendations in relation to a greater army and a greater navy oc cupy a considerable portion of the mesage and arguments not at all new are advanced in favor of the re commendations made. The balance of the document is devoted to a tame discussion of foreign affairs. There is nothing particularly ex citing in the message of President Roosevelt and it could have been ab breviated to at least one-half its di mensions without injury to the country and without depriving the public of any knowledge It might care to acquire.

SAGE-BRUSH FIESTA. The Death of the Desert to be Cele brated in Idaho. (Collier's.) Festivals to celebrate the creation of something are familiar, but a fes tival to celebrate a disappearance is something new. That is what Idaho proposes to have. The sage-brush is retreating from the Arid West be fore the advance of irrigation, and the Pocatello "Tribune" has suggest ed that its parting should be speeded by a "sage-brush fiesta," to mark the 1*1 G ^BUTU (rai) J j'?' m a j M| ^MAP'OF^ IIEMHI COUNTS 1 A H I is !.

They might have celebrated the work of the Reclamation Service in a literal and commonplace way, but the idea of attaching the celebration to the passing of the sage gives oc casion a touch of the poetic. Looking out over the deeert, "silent, sombre, tremendous, lone, austere," the Poc atello "Tribune" sees how "its army —massed ranks of sage-brush, un countable millions In serrlated col umns and files—awaits, leaderless, its annihilation." It asks: "Why not, then, a fiesta de salvia to mark the passing of the sage? Why not a fete, to honor the death of the desert?" The West answers: "Why not?" and the fiesta Is to be held. Adams Admitted to Bail. Steve Adams was admitted to bail in the district court Monday morn ing, the bond being fixed at $20, 000.00. Attorney Darrow stated that bond would be forthcoming within a few days. When the district court was open ed Monday morning Steve Adams was again brought on, and Mr. Darrow, his attorney, at once made a motion to have his client admitted on bail. Mr. Hawley made only slight objec tion and after brief argument Judge Woods admitted Adams to bail in the sum of $20,000.00. Mr. Darrow stated that the bond would be forth coming within a few days. It is now expected that as soon as Adams is released he will be rearrested on the charge of the murder of Arthur Col lins at Telluride Colorado, in 1902, and will be taken at once to that state. Dawn of New Era That the country is already begin ning to recover from the severe shock received in the recent panic is the opinion of E. H. Harriman, as expressed in an Interview published in New York Wednesday. Mr. Har riman said: "There will be no falling back, Each step that we are taking is firm, Underneath the whole situation there is industrial stability. There is too much work to be done and too great capacity for doing it to allow a long drawn out depression, There are indications everywhere that confidence is being restored, The country is too big and the pe opfe too ooaofblo to allow the acta a fow man to shako their faith in tho integrity of our great financiers and hualnoso men na a whole. Notur ally, there was a little scare at first, but when the people saw that there were rotten spots only here and there, they quickly recovered from their fright. The dawn of a new era ot prosperity is here, strain on cash is being relieved and credit is once more being allowed to perform Its normal work. But we must not at once expect to see every line of commercial business as active The over as it baB been during the past two years. Perhaps it is better for the country that It should be so. We have a presidential campaign in front of us. It is only natural that we should feel our way cautiously for some time. When I say cauti ously, however, I do not mean hesi tatingly, but rather conservatively." Mr. Harrlman speaks for his kind —for the big financiers. It may be true, and probably is, that the big fellows Intend to feel their way cau tiously until after election: but that very caution will have a good effect. Any cause which will bring about a cessation of reckless investment and stock gambling—which has been the real cause of the prevailing stringen cy—is good for the financial health of the nation. If such a condition can obtain permanently, one might be pardoned for wishing for a pre sidential election every year.—Poc atello Tribune. Sagebrusli Fiesta. That the Tribune's Sagebrush Fiesta idea has caught the popular fancy not only of the people of the west but of the east as well is at tested by the fact that Collier's Weekly in its last issue editorially places its stamp of approval on the plan. Collier's says: "Festivals to celebrate the crea tion of something are familiar, but a festival to celebrate a disappearance is something new. That is what Ida ho proposes to have. The sage-brush is retreating from the arid west be fore the advance of irrigation, and the Pocatello 'Tribune' has suggest ed that its parting be speeded by a 'sage-brush fiesta,' transformation of the desert into a region of farms and homes, idea has struck root, and the fiesta is to be held at Pocatello next year. "Of course, it is not Idaho alone that is interested in the shrinkage of the desert.

When the education of the mlddfe age* had accomplished lta work, when the barbarian and .pagan had been Christianised, whea from Mm various dialects and Latin had come the romance languages, monastic teaching ceased to be a power, tt still lingers with us, but as an in fluence it long ago came to an end. The conquest of Constantinople forced the learned scholars of that city westward and naturally they came to Italy. They brought with them the learning of the ancients, the beginning of Hermonlstic edu cation. These scholars came to the great cities of Italy, and soon became mem bers of the households of the power ful merchants and newly-created These, fearing their new nobles. honors would melt away and posteri ty would never hear of them, glad ly welcomed the newcomers. They hoped through the Influence of these educators they might live, much similar do we find conditions Look at our great public How today! benefactors! Istn't there a similar feeling present today? These scholars learned the native tongue, because their own beloved Greek was unknown to the western mind. This was the greatest gift to education. Previously men had to learn Latin to become educated. Much time was lost in this acquisi tion. Now men could learn all in their own tongue. The men of the East opened to western Europe the ancient authors. They unfolded to an awe stricken people the wonders of Odyssey, the Iliad, the works of Plato, Socrates, Aristotle. "Go to the ancients," said they, "they knew all things." So back to the glorious days of Greece and Rome they carried the people. The effects were felt in the arts, literature, and buildings, es pecially the latter. Instead of cita dels and armed camps came grace ful buildings. Instead of a harsh, hard way of living came ease and even luxury. This luxury was the "stubble sown with the seed." It grew up and gave as Its fruits "only thorns and thistles..'' To another generation this stubble was given as a legacy for eradication. Released from church ifluence men broadened their outlook. They began to study how to live well rather than how to die well. It re mained for our times to learn how to live well so we may die well. For the first time men thought of their bodies as well as of their souls. The study of anatomy produced in terest in the science of medicine. From stilted prose men turned by invitation to limpid poetry. Witness the works of Dante in his Divine Comedy. Men suddenly thrown in to new conditions, unprepared, naturally drift into abuse of these now conditions. The way from lux ury to voluptuousness was easy; from medicine, the preserver; to poison, the destroyer. Read the pages of the history of Florence and this retrogression is evident to all. Had the now education done good Had mankind been im proved or retrograded ubder ii? These are the questions that are al ways asked when any now movement 1 b in sway. Yes, men were improv ed by this movement. Life was made easier. Men could enjoy more gifts of God. The world was better be cause men were broader. It was the restoration of u gift retarded because of conditions. We place away in safe keeping some present to our child until he Is older and may ap preciate it. From tho monastic li braries came these hoarded treasu harm ? or res when the world was ready for The had results were by an eradicated. them. other generation other education came to correct the An evils. A new plowing was necessary -new seed must be sown and to the next generation this duty was given.
