TO ALL Auditor Searle Estimates that It Will Be Paid in Full by July 1st 1909. Receipts of the Biennium. The estimated reccits for the hi. ennium made by State Auditor Searle. including receipts of the temporary school fund, amount to $0,654,392.18, and the expenditures estimated tor the biennium amount to $G,499,9S7 03, leaving a surplus .of $154,405.23. Tho receipts are estimated on a collection of 95 per cent of the general funi levy and on other funds actual col oc tions. According to Mr. Searle the floating debt of the state will be wiped out by July 1, 1909. At the close of the last biennium, November 30, 1906, the floating interest-bearing debt of the state amount ed to $1,916,671.31. At the close of the biennium ending November 30, 1908, the same amounted to $768,478. 72, showing a decrease of $1,148,192.59 for the period. The special levy pro vided by the Sheldon bill has retired. $636,123.95 of the debt, and the bal ance of the decrease, or $512,068.64, arose from increased valuations and new property listed. This has been brought about by the operation of the new revenue law. A large majority of te county treasurers report that under the present system over 99 per cent of the tax Itv'.ed is collected. The total income of the general fund for the fiscal period commencing April 1, 1909, and ending March 31, 1911, is $4,389,928.64. This estimate Is based on 95 per cent of the prob able levies of 1910 and 1909 assum ing that the assessments and levies for these years will not differ materi ally from the total assessments and' levies for the year 1908. This estimate, being based so nearly on a 100 per cent basis, necessitates no estimate on that basis. The reports heretofore have been based on 85 per cent in stead of 95 per cent, but we have done away with that basis owing to the pro visions made under he new revenue law for the collection of the total amount levied, although 85 per cent was a good average under the old law.
