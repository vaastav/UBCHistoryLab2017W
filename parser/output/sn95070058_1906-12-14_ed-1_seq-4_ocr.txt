All bankers are awaiting inoro detailed Information on the subject , with con siderable Interest , and will hope for restrictions stringent enough to safe guard the measure In every way. TUB SUGAR FACTORY. Tlio Norfolk Industrial company has decided that a sugar factory could bo made to pay hero. The president of the company now holding the old sugar factory property believes this and would , under certain conditions , bo willing to organize ft company to es tablish a sugar factory bore. There nro no doubt others In the country who would bo Interested If their attention were brought "to the nmttor. If n local company could bo orga nised under conditions , an opportunity Is presented to the Commercial club to try and arrange the necessary con ditions. If no local company could bo organized , then the chance Is given to the Commercial club to advertise the possibilities. 

CONVENTIONS FOR NORFOLK. The efforts of tlio Madison county commissioners to Madison county and Norfolk , are 'along the right line and will meet with the hearty co-operation , In Interest at least , of this section. It Is a line nlong which the Norfolk Commercial club ought to have been working for some tlmo past and would , no doubt , with an active head. Secretary Hanson of the Fremont club pointed out to Norfolk the value of state conventions , especially con ventions of hard-headed , thinking men. County commissioners nro specially qualified as guests because they are shrewd business men , picked in their several communities by virtue of their good business judgment. They would readily see the good points of the city they visit , and would go homo and talk about these good points. It Is good advertising , cheaply gained. There are many other state conven tions which could bo secured for Nor folk during the year , and they are all worth while. The Commercial club lias funds and If the president were to outline a campaign of this sort , many such assemblies could no doubt bo gained. This is ono of the many reasons why Norfolk should own n good active Commercial club. THE 

STOUER AFFAIR. President Roosevelt will have the country's sympathy in the Storor mix- up. The president , It appears from the Vatican's semi-ofllclnl statement that several persons appeared before the pope representing to como from the head of the American government , did lot abuse bis position in connection vlth tlio appointment of a cardinal , resident Roosevelt will generally bo olioved when he says that ho refused i > meddle in the matter and that ho omoved the Storors because Mrs. \orer was too much interested in af- irs that wcro outside the otllclal Opacity of herself and husband. President Roosevelt has been sub- l ! ted by the Storers to a violation of unwritten law of fair play , which s that no private letter shall bo dished" without the consent and j iwledgo of the writer. President yjsevelt had been a. friend to the yers , both politically and personal- paj For this reason , in his communl- olipn to the Storors , ho blended the thoonal with the ofllclal , which wns Bennder that he now appreciates. It Tell enough always to keo'p busl- onteseparatcd from personal relations Weasbarp lino. Tl Roosevelt has been ruflled by torta Wed ) | this broach of confldi'iicu to no Incon siderable degree. Ho has given out words that fairly slzzlo In hln retort to the Storors. Ho lost patience , and none will blame him. There como moments when human patlonco snaps , for It IB pofislblo to "egg on" the most dc'llbcrato of men to a point of danger. The SlororB , not the president , have suffered from this attack on their part. 

CORTELYOU'S REPORT. Postmaster ( Jonernl Cortelyou , In his annual leport , brings out the same point mink1 In Ihosn coliimiiH several days ago with regard to the Inslgnlll- canrn of the postal dollclt. Elllcloncy. not money piollt , according to Mr. Cor- telyou. In what Is needed first of all , and the government ought to look at this plume of the sorvlco rather than at the necessity of playing oven. To leduro postage rat her than to Increase It , Is the high Ideal set by the post master general. In discussing the railroad contracts , ho declares that while II Is his Impression that too much money Is being spent for trans portation , he Is not ready to make a statement to this effect , nor Is ho will ing to recommend legislation covering the point. The recommendation In this report for better roads throughout the nation will bo met with enthusiasm by farm ers of the tuition as well as by people living In small towns In the rural dis tricts. All of the departments of the federal government are seeking to get national funds laid aside for better roads , but thus far they have failed to Interest President Roosevelt In the movement and ho hns declared , ac cording to some of the friends of good rends , that the subject bores him. The general tendency of the govern ment Is toward benefiting the farmers and the rural districts. The country Is awaking to the fact that the coun try's prosperity depends upon the soli and its products and the sentiment of James J. Hill for federal experi ment farms , as well ns the expressions of all of fie various departments of the government for bettor roads , are outgrowths of this recognition which Is now being given to the American farmer. 

VOLUNTEER FIREMEN. Three volunteer Ilromon , all of them prominent business men of Ithaca , Now York , are dead as n result of their efforts to save the burning Chi Pal fraternity house , In which , besides these men , four students lost their lives. The heroism of those volun teer firemen , and their sacrifice , is slgnltlcant of the spirit that Is shown by all volunteer firemen and should cause the small towns of this country to stop and think over for a. moment the deeds which their own neighbors , volunteer firemen , are over ready to do in case of emergency. Norfolk has a lire department that would give up Just as much as did the volunteers at Hhaca , should occasion demand. It Is a protection that should be appre ciated In the fullest sense by any com munity. Out in the cold night , tlmo after tlmo , the Norfolk lire boys have gone to fight against flames that threatened destruction to whole blocks of the business portion of the city. Only last week a case of this sort occurred. The keen north wind came down with biting force and drove the chill through and through the firemen who had responded in the early morning hours to that alarm. Water from three streams of hose soon sprayed over all of the fire fighters and still they clung to the struggle , soaking to the skin. And , best of all , they re stricted llnmes which scorned suroof spreading Into adjoining structures , to the ono building In which it originat ed. ed.Wo Wo seldom stop long enough to ap preciate the work that the volunteers in flro sorvlco are performing for a community. The sacrifice of three lives in Ithaca shows to what limits they will go if necessary. COLLEGE SPIRIT. Four students perished In the fra ternity house lire at Cornell. Seven others wore injured , of whom at least oio , it was thought , must die. Among the dead and Injured were bravo young fellows who faced the flames with de liberate risk , that they might help res cue their fellow students. Ono young Cornell undergraduate re-entered the burning building after it had been cre ated into an Inferno , in a futile effort to rescue his room mate. Ho was so badly burned that ho , too , died within an hour. Football players who have earned sweaters on the Cornell team and whoso nerve on the gridiron had made them favorites , responded to the call of danger In this flro ns though it were n football signal , and fought against these flames just as courage ously ns though they hnd been an op posing Princeton lino. Hero It was that the manhood and Iron nerve and unselfishness wrought out in football training , made Itself apparent to good advantage. Hero it was that gridiron heroes , acting on In stinct gained In inter-collegiate bat tles , leaped Into the perilous situation for the sake of their comrades and died for them. Seven lives , lives of extraordinary value ) were glvoii up In ( hat ftro and the beautiful Chi Psl lodge , built at a cost of $130,000 , IH n heap of'nslies , but the action brought out In tb'at aw ful hour will stand as n long-time monument to the memory of the dnad. It was a beautiful Illustration of the nobleness of heart that seems to bo In the very air of the great universities of this country. It was a splendid picture of thu depth of feeling that those college boys hold down In their hearts for their mates their frater nity brothers. It was a sad day on the campus of old Cornell , but n day replete with truest heroism a heroism that shnll llvo forever In college annals around that campus. INSANE HOSPITAL NEEDS. The report made by Dr. Young , su perintendent at the Nebraska state hospital for the Insane , shows that the Institution Is very much over crowded and that more room Is needed as a matter of economy on the part of the stnto. Nobrankn owns the Institution niul will take care of It In the most economical way. For tills reason It Is believed that the coming legislature will bo glad to make an appropriation of at least $90,000 , asked for by Dr. Young , for ropnlrs nnd nddcd build ings. It Is snld Hint the death rnto hns bocn high because of the cramped con dition. Every family who has an un fortunate kin in the Institution will bo anxious for the added room and will help toward gaining that added room by bringing to the notice of va rious state senators and representa tives , the pressing need. It has been said that , from the con stantly Increasing number of patients for Insane hospitals In Nebraska , the Norfolk institution will require addi tional room every year for ton years to como , before the demand for room is properly filled. SHAW'S ELASTIC CURRENCY. Secretary Shaw has como forth with a form of elastic currency that Is all his own. Ho will deposit $10,000,000 in various banks of the largo cities , half of the loan to bo returned Janu ary 20 and half on February 1. Ho discusses money stringency from a viewpoint that can not bo sympathized with by the west. Nebraska bankers recently took action Just opposed to the lonn which Is to bo mndo by'tho sccrotnry of the trensury , when they voted solidly against the proposed cur rency reform. Secretary Shaw says , speaking of his plan : "There Is no occasion for alarm , but I believe there is occasion tor relief. "This I have decided to grant in' ' the following manner : "I will deposit $10.000.000 In exist ing depositaries in tlio cities designat ed below , to ho secured by bonds ac ceptable for savings bank Investment under the laws of Now York and Mas sachusetts , taken at DO per cent , of their value , those deposits to be re turned one-half on the 20th of January nnd the remainder on the 1st of Febru ary. I will also buy $10,000,000 of the bonds of 1907 at the following prices : Registered bonds , ox-Interest , nt 101 nnd coupon bonds at 102. In the event that the bonds purchased are now held as security of the character above In dicated will bo accepted in lieu there of. Not more than $1-000,000 worth , however , will bo purchased from any single institution under these condi tions. The deposits will bo mndo as follows : "Now York and New Orleans , $1- 500,000 each ; Uoston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Chicago and St. Louis , $1- 000,000 each ; Cincinnati. Louisville , Atlanta and Memphis , $500,000 each. " The following explanation of the nlleged situation will not particularly appeal to the western farmers , be cause they have enough money of their own to get along on : "From the best Information I can got I think the following describes the situation fairly well : "Our blessings are the real cause of the actual stringency In money recog nized everywhere. An unexpectedly largo crop and industrial activity have caused an unprecedented demand for monoy. The world is everywhere pros perous nnd money is in great dcmnnd throughout Europe ns well ns in the United States. Wo never had such n volume of credits , and they are based on an unequnled volume of assets. The manufacturers of cotton are buy ing that staple by the train load. The cotton planter , unlike the western farmers , demands actual cash and carries It homo In his pocket. The western fanner Is paid In checks , which ho deposits in the bunk to his credit , nnd therefore does not nbhorb actual money as does the cotton plant er. This money should bo returned to the banks when the planter settles with his merchant soon after the first of Januaryt but between now and then the cotton consuming country as well as the cotton producing country Is short of money. Now England has sent millions to the south and the manufacturers of cotton throughout the south have ex hausted the capacity of local banks and nro trying to borrow elsewhere. BRYAN AND OWNERSHIP. The announcement made by Mr. Harrington of O'Neill In Norfolk that n convention of government owner- * ' " r i * ship clnba In Nebraska will bo hold nt Southi Omnhft on December 31 , brings northern Nebraska prominent ly Into national politics , so far as the presidential nomination In the demo cratic party Is concerned. Mr. Bryan has apparently selected three northern Nebraska men to launch his candidacy and It Is not two much to assume from this announcement that government ownership will become the paramount Issue , so far as Mr. Brynn is concerned - corned , In 1908. From the present In dications , It would appear that Mr. Bryan will carry his ownership slogan with him Into the democratic national convention and It Is to bo expected that ho will cling to the Idea , regard less of the south with Its .Tim Crow cars , regardless of the conservative element In democracy , nnd carry It with him Into the race. The fact that Senator Allen , Mr. Harrington and Judge Edgar Howard have united In the plan looks ns though Mr. Brynn has hoped to unite In a national fusion the populist and democratic parties for his race. Mr. Bryan has been comparatively silent silent for him since election with the exception of expressing his opinion upon the president's message , nnd It Is believed thnt this meeting which Is to be pulled off at South Omahn on the thirty-first of this month , behind which are prominent northern Nebraska political leaders , will carry more significance than the mere announcement might Indicate. The ropubllcnn pnrty could hope for nothing better than the adoption of this wnr cry of Mr. Brynn In 1908. In the first plnco it would furnish a paramount - mount issue. Paramount issues hnvo become highly essential to the presi dential campaigns In which Mr. Bryan takes part , and it is anticipated that ho will work the battlecry to the limit. But the1 south , the solid , democratic south , with Its Jim Crow car tp give it personal Interest in the contest , will fight the head of the ticket on such a movement. Mr. Brynn at ono time , after his Madison Square speech , de clared down In Georgia that ho wns no more In fnvor of government own ership of railroads than President Roosevelt , and thnt he did not believe the people would over force the Issue. Yet here In his own state , and prob ably not without his knowledge , the Issue Is to bo forced. The government ownership fallacy hns been receiving jolts of late thnt promise to mnko It n hnrd bnnner to cnrry. A prlvnto publisher , highly re sponsible becnu&e he is n man of many millions , has recently guaranteed to take over the postolllco department nnd run it more economically than it Is now being operated. Yet the post- office stands ns n high typo of federal ownership utility. Omaha has had a sorry experience witli government ownership on a large scnlo. The water plnnt built there wns appraised at six million dollars after the city hnd determined to contlscnto the institution nnd opernto It. The nctunl value Is said to bo about three million. And now the ownership fad dists In that town hnvo determined to build n now plnnt and operate it under municipal ownership , so that the city may have two water plants instead of one , nnd with n prospect of getting , in the end , none Instead of two. It Is a question whether the present water board in that city can legally annul the former decision to buy the old water plant , so that the plot has merely thickened , nnd the taxpayers are growing tired of the game. For the sake of republican success In 1908 , It Is to bo hoped thnt the con vention of "ownership clubs" to beheld held In South Omnha on December 31 , will hnvo a nntlonal slgnlficnnce. 

AROUND TOWN. You never know how n law suit is coming out until the verdict Is ren dered. A little boy visiting In Norfolk the other day , from California , and who had never seen snow , was amazed when a flurry of flakes nppenred. "Grnndmn , " ho cried. "The snow Is downing. " Chrlstmns rudely Interferes with hu man comfort. Ono man In Norfolk the other day asked his wife to give him buckwheat cakes for breakfast. "I'm too busy with Chrlstmns things to stop now , " she said. "After Christmas I'll do it. " The Norfolk bar has taken Madison by storm this week. Eggs are so high that the public can hardly roach them , though standing on tip-toe. Norfolk today can almost hear the slelghbells of Santa Clans as they Jingle - glo toward this town center of the universe at Christmas time. The mlllenium is approaching. Young women are beginning to assume re sponsibility over the furnaces At a party In Norfolk the other dny a young lady , right in the middle of a hand at whist , called to her father , some ta- 1 'ile ' away , nnd nsked If ho hnd attended - od to the air check ngnln. | "You pay your money and take your choice , " has hidden Its head nt a mot- 'to this year. "You pay your money and thko what's loft ? ' Is the Christmas shopping cry of 1900 , Oncu more Norfolk's luck kept off the snow storm. The Ice box has lost Its appetite , but the furnace has n good stomach. School boys enjoyed the visit of Norfolk teachers to Omaha , very much. At the present price of eggs , bar bers ought to raise their rates on an egg shampoo. How would you llko to bo n boy again , with prospects of getting a real steam engine that would run , for Christmas ? Most boys have wondered whether Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer" ever grew up and got married . The puzzle Is solved. "Mrs. Tom Sawyer , " whoso homo Is in Iowa , passed through Nor folk last week to visit friends in Now- mnn Grove. Certain "Knignts 01 Norfolk" hav ing been criticised by the "Fnlro Ln- dyes" for omitting the snld falro la- dyes from sundry entertainments , the knights last Saturdny eve refrained from mingling In a quiet party and comforted themselves with the thought that now nil would be fnlr snlllng butte to their dismay , they found the falro ladyes had taken reproof into their owns hands by going onmasso to the said festivities. The Holy Sabbath day wns largely given up to negotln- tions , embassies and secluded confer ences. At times It seemed the irrec- oncilables would raise the ensign of revolt. But diplomacy worthy of n Macchlavelll prevented a cessation of amicable relations nnd now , though the situation Is somewhat strained It Is believed by these most conversant with affairs , thnt n crisis has been averted. Encircled by the sentinel trees in a bend of the Elkhorn Is n rise of ground upon which , screened from the railroad by a grove , stand the farm buildings just as they stood nineteen years ago , when a fifteen-year-old boy , in felt boots and a hallowe'en cap , was picking up cobs , which the hogs , ac- commldntlng creatures , had shelled out of their wrapping of grain. The vision thnt hnd nil day been be tween John and his "flggers" at school still danced before his eyes in the snow. It wns no black-eyed Susan nor blue-eyed Bessie , but a Cndy lint nnd pntont leather shoes of a spruce young man whose manner had made It n pleasure for the youth's father to pass over $105 as part payment for a bind er that had stood out by the granary for a couple of winters. After the chores and supper were over the "kid" bundled himself up and floundered through the snow , alternate layers of "Annie Rooney" and "The Flowers That Bloom in the Spring" freezing to the straggling down on his wenther-benten face , till It shone like Moses In the wilderness , but when ho reached his thresher neighbor's , he got the job of tanking for him the next fall. fall.And And that was his first encounter with the busy outside world. Soon , John was In the shops in Minneapolis , then in some knitting establishment , but the microbe of electrical science had fastened upon him , and now after carrying a half dozen trunks of knit goods over the country for years , ho will at almost every stopping place , unless his appartment is in the sky parlor in the summertime or in the shed room in thp winter , spend every moment his business will allow with a miniature electrical laboratory , that travels everywhere with him in an Innocent looking grip , and ho may one day tell the world where electricity comes from and maybe what it is , and then true progress In the world's his tory will begin. In passing the old farm house , he Is usually recognized by the mother and young brothers , so a greeting is ex changed far oftener than ho can stop to visit John is only ono kind of traveling man. Some of the others another time.
