Washington. D. C, Representa tive Perkins of New Tork spoke to the house on the resolution appoint ing a committee to take the secret service paragraph In the president's message Into consideration. In the midst of a silence and an attention that were both strained and dramatic. The applause that greeted the end of the apeerh waa subdued.

The resolution waa adopted by a unanimous vote, and these members pore appointed by the apeaker to mem bership on the committee: Representative Perkins of New York. Denby of Michigan, Lloyd of Missouri, Williams of Mississippi snd Weeks of Massachusetts. Text of Resolution. This I the text of the resolution: 'Wheress, There was contained In the sundry civil appropriation bill, and which passed congress at Its last session and became a law, a provision In reference to the employment of the secret service In the treasury depart ment; and, "Whereas, In the message of the President of the I'nlted States to the two Houses of Congress, It was stated In reference to that provision: 'It Is not too much to say that this amend ment has been of benefit only, and could be of benefit only to the crim inal classes only,' and it was further stated, 'The chief argument in favor of the provision was that congress men did not themselves wish to be In vestigated by secret service men,' and It was further stated. 'Dut If this is not considered desirable, a special provision could be made In the law, prohibiting the use of the secret ser vice force In Investigating members of congresa. It would be far better to do thla, than to do what actually was done, and strive to prevent, or at least to hamper action against criminals by the executive branch of the govern ment.' "Now. therefore, be It "Resolved. That a committee of five member of this house be appointed by the speaker to consider the state ments contained in the message, of the president and report to the house what action. If any. should be taken In reference thereto." Perkins Take Floor. In presenting the resolution, Mr. Perkins said: 'I arise to a question of the privi lege of the house. "I do not believe in oversensltlve- ness to unfavorable criticism, whether upon an it.dlvldual or upon a public body. But. while there may be undue sensitiveness, si also there may be undue obtuseness, which might argue a lack of propet self-respect. "It Is of Importance to the republic that all of the co-ordinate branches of the government should possess. In a high degree the confidence snd re spect of the people. "I yield to no one in my respect fot the chief executive of the Cnltcd States, snd I yield to no one In my respect for the congress of the United States. To the congress is granted great power, and upon it are Imposed great responsibilities. "The dignity of this body should not be punctiliously Insisted upon, but it should be properly maintained. "The statements made by the presi dent of the I'nlted States cannot be lightly disregarded. These may be so construed by the public aa to lessen the dignity and thereby Impair the uaefulness of the congress of the United Slates It can be justly said. I think, that those expressions were unfortunate. "Whether it is enough to ssy this or whether some more formal action should be taken. It will b for con gress, exercising a wise and discreet judgment to decide." Women Indicted for Murder. Washington, D.
