JOHN BROADHEAD DEAD- End of Pioneer Business Man of This City Comes Peacefully. Within twenty-four days of his 82 birthday, John Broadhead died at the home of his daughter, Mrs. H. V. Speers, at 5 o'clock this morning. The end came to him quietly without pain and without a struggle. He was at tended by his daughter, Miss Martha Broadhead, who, while attempting to assist him to rise from the bed, felt him relax in death in her arms. Mr. Broadhead had been troubled with asthma all of his life, the afflic tion disqualifying him for military service in the civil war times. Some ten years ago he suffered a stroke of paralysis, from which he only parti ally recovered, and which l£?ft his vo cal chords badly paralyzed ever since, altho he has been able to be about the house and on the streets. Mr. Broadhead leaves four daughters and one son, Charles Broadhead, of Dallas, Texas Mrs. S. R. McLaren, of Boise, Idaho Mrs. H. V. Speers, Mrs. T. I. Wasson and Miss Martha Broad head, of this city. John Broadhead was a jeweler in an early day ih Marshalltown, many grandfathers of today having pur chased wedding rings of him in their vsae* to Chicago to Hear Mr. McGee in Pulpit, and is Greatly Pleased—Was Not Applicant, But Call Was Unani­ mous—Other Churches Wanted Him. At the mid-week meeting of the First Baptist church Thursday night, Kev. James McGee, pastor of the Western avenue Baptist church of Chicago, was tendered a unanimous call and ac cepted. Ho will assume pastoral re lations on tihe last Sunday of the month, December 29. Mr. Ale v*?r ^w Gee was not an applicant for the pastorate of the church here, but a committee that went to Chicago to hear hiin preach last Sunday believed that ho was tlie man the local church was looking for. Mr. McGee was invited to visit the city, and was here at the meeting Thursday night. While Mr. MoGee was not particular ly anxious to leave Chicago, he was willing to consider a change by reason of the great influx of non-KnglUh speaking people into the metropolis His church, like ipany others in large cities, is on the verge thi of con- Timcs-llBjinblixHtt, ^tforstelltam toxa REV.

Iowa Churches Wanted Him. Had not the committee from this city heard of Rev. Mr. McGee and decided to recommend him as pastor at Marshalltown, the chances are Mr. Mc Gee would have come to Iowa anyway. The Iowa City church had extended him a call, as had also the church at Shenandoah. The Fourth church at Minneapolis, had invited Mr. McGee to visit them and preach next Sunday, with a view of considering extending him a call. McGee a Young Man. Mr. McGee is a young man, 35 years old. His family consists of a wife and •little daughter of 4. Mr. McGee was educated at Kalamazoo College, a Baptist school at Kalamazoo, Mich. Colgate University, Hamilton, I£.

Mr. Cooper believes that internal parasites, or tapeworms, are respon sible for much ill health, and it is an undoubted fact that his medicine has expelled immense numbers of these creatures in various citics visited by him. The young man also believes that stomach trouble is the main cause of all ill health. Ho claims that few can have poor health with a good di gestion. He further claims that his New Discovery medicine does nothing ljut tone up the stomach, yet :it not only expels the parasites, but relieves many other ailments not as a rule as sociated with stomach trouble. Little Jessie Birdsall, daughter of Mrs. Ida Birdsall, living at 2138 Car roll Avenue, Chicago, is among many relieved of a large parasite by Mr. Cooper's preparation during his stay in that city. In speaking of the mat ter to Mr. Cooper, the mother said: "My child Jessie, who is fourteen years old, has been suffering with this trouble for over seven years.
