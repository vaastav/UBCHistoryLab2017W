Jackson count 's prosecutor jestcrday made another of his remarkable bargains with professional crooks. In this case the other party to the contract was "Jimmy ' Considlne, one of the smoothest and most notorious burglars, diamond thieves and confidence men known to the police, who is wanted In a half dozen cities for daring crimes. The particular offense for which he was held In this city was robbing a Grand avc nue Jeweler of two -valuable diamonds, lie was pursued and captured by the mer chant, and in the struggle placed his re volver ngtilnst the breast of the man ho had robbed and snapped It twice, but the weapon was not discharged. Like the three porch climbers who were Riven light sentences last week by an ar rangement with Prosecutor Lowe, Consl dine is a professional crook, and one, fur thermore, of unusual accomplishments. He should hnve hud the full limits of the law. But Mr. Lowe arranged with this thief and would-be murderer and his attorney to ad mit a plea of guilty and make the sen tence the paltry service of three years in the penitentiary. No one thought Frank M. Lowe would make a particularly competent prosecuting attorney, but even his political opponents believed that he would be conscientious. The disgrace he Is bringing upon Kansas City and Jackson county by his com promises with professional crooks must bo astounding to even his most indulgent friends, Mr. Lowo could not have served tho porch climbers and this last scoundrel more effectively if he had been engaged as their attorney instead fef being in the posi tion of their prosecutor. piummy election nnroiom. The movement to hold a national con vention of political reformers with a view to securing the adoption in various states of laws more i-trlctly to regulate and pro tect caucuses and primary elections should be encouraged in every possible way by the high principled people of all parties. It Is not a new diagnosis to say that the fundamental evils of our political sy stems lie in the primaries. These are too frequent ly governed and used by gang politicians whom the reputable -voters allow- to run things to suit themselves. If stricter laws were enacted for the regulation of prima ries and greater encouragement were thereby given to the better daises to par ticipate in the preliminary proce-ses of se lecting candidates for public office, great reform might he achieved. At any rate a national movement in this direction is a good sign. It is apparent that something mut be done to give great er protection to society against disreputa ble politicians who manage to get into of fice through a successful manipulation of the too much neglected primaries. GOVERNOR STEPHENS OX I'lSIOV. The Populists nnd free silver Republicans of Missouri must feel highly complimented by the estimates placed upon their worth and influence by Gov crnor Stephens In the interview he had with himself at the state capital the other day. Kvcn the governor must have been considerably surprised by this interview, for he gave utterance to many things he hid never heard himsqlf mv before He frankly advises against fusion -with tho Pops and "llver Republic ans where fusion Is not necessary, but urges combinations where it is necessary to overcome Republicanism. He wants fu sion In national politics, but wants none of It in Missouri affairs. In other words, he advises Democrats to be holy when they can be so without danger to the party's success, but when such success is imperiled to be as unholv- as the circumstances seem to make necessary to insure Ictory. This is perhaps the frankest recognition of "necessary evil" that has jet been made by a piomlnent Democrat, but it Is pre cisely the spirit in which the -various al lies of the Democratic party are re garded by Democrats, if it were not tho plain, unvarnished ttutli, it would be a gross Insult to the representatives of the vagarious creeds, but being the truth It must be taken as other disagreeable facts are taken. But the governor Is unneccssirily severe upon the friends and allies of the Demo cratic partv. He says tlj it "but few of the Populists who returned to the Democratic partv last year came for oflice." What a willful, direct and colnssii affront to the principles of Popocracj ! Jlriiti he snjs that "no honest Populist could be bought with the promise of a Democratic nomination." But whit in tho name of the nnk and file has that to do with the hosts that are not honest? Governor Stephens refers to Brj in as "our admiration rnd our gloij," predicts tho Nebiaska man's renominatlon, ndvisrs a trcatv with the Pops and other sllverltes and adds tint "in the event of n ition il success they would le treated without pre judice by our president when ho goes to reward his servants, as I have trietl to treit them and propose to treat them dur ing my administration." Herein Missouri's governor has revealed what he seems to regard as the primary mission of the successful politician. We hnve been accustomed to look upon the induction intOjOflicc as the assumption of the solemn obligations of Mite bv a pre ferred citlzen.Jbut Mr. Stephens calmly re fers tei it as ''going to reward his serv ants." If oui enigmatical governor has misquot ed himself in this interview he should tako himself to task and administer to himself a wholesome rebuke but If he has not misrepresented himself, the Pops and silver Republicans must regard themselves as the component parts of the governors doormat IS 

1IV1VII I.EPItOSY TO nu rmituo; In reciting yesterdiy the list of objections which have been raised against the annexa tion of the Sandwich Islands, we purposely emitted one with the view of giving it more extended mention than was then possible. Ave refer to the prevalence of leprosy upon th islands and the fear that it may spread to the United States It is not made clear by those who ad vance this objection how there would be any more danger of the disease spreading rftcr annexation than before. It is true, perhaps, tint after annexation the commu nications between the two lands will be come more frequent, but first it will be nec essary to show th it communications of anv sort or frequeno are beset with danger. Ever since the United States has had set tlements upon the Pacific coast, intercourse between this country and the blinds has gene on uninterruptedly, and jtt it is doubtful if a single case of leprosy can be authenticated that was carried across the intervening water. San Trancisco has had, and still has, leprosy within her gates, but it carao from China, and is confined to the CI inese who brought it over. Occasion lib one may read accounts of some white man who has become inoculated with the dis ease, but they are never authenticated by attending physician. In New Orleans there 1, is been some leprosy among the w lute people, and in New Brunswick there is a lazaretto which has not been free from leprosy for fifty years, but in neither case can tho plague be traced to tho Sandwich Islands. We are Indebted to Professor A. F. Cor vin, who recently published an article In the Yale Scientific Monthly, for some ac count of the development of leprosy In Ha waii. It is not possible to fixe the date of its first appearance there. The period be tween ls23-30 is approximately the correct time, though it may have existed for cen turies before. It is raid that several of the ancient chiefs had a disease closely resem bling leprosy, if not leprosy itself, but Pro fessor Corwin Is of tho opinion, along witn most authorities, that this was not leprosy, but a disease caused by high living. Tho native islanders believe that the dis ease was brought to them by the Chinese, and they call it "mal pake." or Chinese disease. Many theories have been ad vanced as to tho cause of the spread of the disease after it once had gained a foothold Some have laid it to the fish diet of the people, others to the lack of salt, but others still to a contagion very easily spread by the filthy habits of the early -day natives, v ho ate from the same dish and smoked from the same pipe. At the same time the authorities all agree that the natives had a peculiar susceptibility to the disease, just as a negro has to consumption and a white man to malaria. This susceptibility Is am p'y proved by the fact that the white resi dents of Hawaii are practically exempt from leprosy. Out of the 1.0S7 lepers now In Hawaii, no less than 971 are natives Up to 1SG3 the disease was not considered contagious, but its alarming spread led the Hawaiian government to pass an official act in that jear entitled, "An act to pre vent the spread of leprosy." The system, employed was similar in principle to the successful measures ued In ancient times, except that It was much more humane. In olden limes If a man was found to be a leper, whatever property he had was wrest ed from him, his wlfo was declared di vorced, end he became a despised out cast. In Hawaii all lepers are sent to Molokai. an island about thirty miles from Honolulu, on which a tract of 3,000 acres Is given over to their use. Sajs Professor Corwin: "It is a broad and fertile domain, bor dered on tlirco sides by the ocean and on tho land side by a towering rampart of precipitous bluffs 2 000 feet high. The broad plain, thus enclosed and rendered inaccessible, presents a picturesque surf.ico and is ever covered with a luxuriant ver dure. Under these delightful conditions Hawaii's lepers live. Here they are at tended by eminent physicians on leprosy from many countries, and by skilled nurses The settlement at Molokai is a little -world by Itself, where men give and take in mar riage, rear families, have schools and churches, and, in fact, are governed by laws enacted by themselves. Their physical wants are abundantly satisfied by Hawaii's large anil annual appropriation There arc certain hours each diy whpn they may see their friends, separated from them only by a fence, so that infection is impossible. The one possible flaw in tho system is that children of leprous parents, though they themselves may not be lepers, are obliged to stay upon the Island " Tho disease Is steadily decreasing un der this sjstem. Last jear the number of lepers was reduced ncarlj one hundred and the jear before about sixtj-five. There are now 1.0S7 cases all told. Had not politics interfered, it Is believed that tho lepers would not count half their present! num ber. Under King Kalakaua the segrega tion laws were not stringently enforced, the king thereby gaining favor among a strong fiction of the natives. Under Queen Liliuokalml, however, and since her reign, these laws hive been carefully enforced and it is now a certainty that in time tho disease can be entirely eradicated. Hawaii annually expends $130 OX) in the support nnd caro of lepers This requires a tax of $1 30 on everj Inhabitant of the island, but It is said that no one begrudges It as all are imbued with the necessity of stamping out this plague ontlrelj". EDITOItl II, "NOTES. The Democratic orpins hive finally found the structural weakness in tint message. The president splits his infinitives. It will be noticed that General Grovenor is not bulletlng the majorities bv which he expects to overthrow the civil service liw.

Our town Is getting dreadfully behind the procession in this mittcr.

Governor OTerrall, of Virginia, is mak ing an earnest crusade against ljnching, and thus far his record Is consistent. He has not vetoed a bill to suppress foot ball. People who refuse to follow the leader ship of G. C. Clemens and old man Waite would object to jumping off a precipice. Still there are men in the world Jut that unreasonable.

Ex-Gov ernor "Waite declares that the rec ord of the Democratic parti- is as bad as that of the Republican party. If Waite's wheels keep revolving he will bj and bj discover that pitch Is as black as snow. General Grosvenor's position that It is undemocratic to build up an office-holding class In this countrj is sound enough, but General Grosvenor is likely to come oft second best in his fight on the civil ser vice law, nevertheless. It maj- be proper to explain that Mr. Frank M. Lowe is the prosecuting attor ney for Jackson countj, not the attorney for tho thieves and thugs brought before tho criminal court. This is the f.ict, how ever much Mi1. Lowe's settlements of crim inal cases may indicate the contrarj. It is chnrzed against Mr. Tilley that as a delegate in the Republican convention of '61 he voted against the renominatlon of Abraham Lincoln. It Is not necessary to go back thirtj -three jears, however, to con vict Mr. rilley of political blundering. His recent outrageous assaults on the Republic an partj-, in letters to Democratic pipers, are abundantlj- sulllcient to condemn him. The Travelers' lnsurai.ee Companj, which is being harassed by Superintendent Webb McNall, can learn something to its advantage bj communicating in confidence with the New- York Life Company. It is not necessarj- to pay the Hillmon claim or even a license fee in order to conduct insurance business peacefully in Kmsas, if a companj- has plentj of enterprise and few scruples President McKinleej- declares that all the great questions now before congress rise above partisanship There is no assur ance, however, that Democratic and Popu list congressmen will rise above partisan ship. The indications are that m iny of them will be for whatever will embarrass the administration. That is their customa ry rule of action. The good people wjho secured commuta tion of the negro Williams' sentence on the ground that he is innocent should not rest with that. It is an awful thing for an in nocent man to be locked up in the peni tentiary for fifty jears. If Williams did not commit the crime of which he was con victed he is entitled to his liberty and the restoration of his good name and citizen ship. Are tho good people who have in terested themselves in Williams' behalf go ing to permit this greit wrong? KAMjAS

While tho colored brother, ns a rule, is exceedingly- amiible, there still remains tho case of Mr. Frank Fussnigger, of Han over, to account for. The announcement is authoritativelj made that Mr. W.

For fifteen jears people have been predict ing that ho would receive some high olfice in recognition of his line abilities, but ho has never landed anj-where. A new candidate for the Republican nom ination for governor has made his appear ance in the person of Georgo O. Parr, of Rooks county. Tho Stockton News sijs that while Mr. Farr has never been an as pirant for anj- offlce he possesses the qual ifications to make a governor. If the News regarded it3 candidate as an able man It ought to havo said so outright and not stopped at the half waj- point.

Mr. Thomp son says: "As a result, the publisher finds himself with an expensive festival num ber of the magazine readv for the press and the printer naturally- unwilling to Is sue the work The publisher feels the failure of the venture all the more keenly because of the fact that the subscription list consists lirgely of the names of friends willing and anxious to aid To these, as well as all other subscribers, the thanks of the publisher are due, and they are assured that the sums set opposite their names will be refunded as soon as his earnings in other business, jet to be determined, will permit."

"The greatest speech I ever heard Henry Clay Dean make," said a well known Mis souri official the other day, "was to an au dience of two, my wife and myself. It was at my farm house in Schuv Ier county. Dean lived about three miles away. He had been inj Iowa delivering his great lecture upon the 'Mistakes of Ingersoll.' As was his habit he stopped at my house on his way home My wife had just started out of the room to prepare a lunch when I asked Dean what ho had been talking about up in Iowa. He did not answer my question but getting up from his chair ho proceeded to tell us My wife stopped on her way out of the room and there for two hours Dean gave us the most profound, most pictur esque, most eloquent address I ever heard from the lips of any man. It had the fire of genuine oratory- in it. Mv wife stood like one entranced, while I sat with mouth open, hanging on his words.

With tho unveiling of the now sheeted statues of Benton and Blair in Statuary hall at the capitol, Missouri will enjoy a peculiar distinction, writes Walter Stevens from Washington to the Globe-Democrat. By tho terms under w hich the hall is grad ually filling with figures in marble and bronze of eminent Americans, each jstate iu the Union is allowed two representatives in the collection. But, with Benton and Blair added, Missouri will have three ex senators in the hall. The bronze figure of General James Shields Is already in posi tion, put there by another state. Yet the last public service of the gallant Irishman, "hero of two wars and senator from three states," was for Missouri in the senate chamber. He died a Mis&ourian. The stat ues of Benton and Blair stand on the east side of the hall, and that of Shields is im mediately facing them on the west gide. The memory of Shields Is perpetuated not alone in bronze. The figure has its con spicuous place in the great historical paint ing of the battle of Chapultepec which hangs in ono of the grand staircases of the senate wing. In his shirt sleeves, sword in rand, tho general stands in the foreground diiecting the movements of the American tioops on that most picturesque of the Mexican battlefields. When the pedestal of the statue of Blair, which Missouri has presented to Statuary hall, was standing in that hall the other day awaiting its bronze figure, someone no tlceel, tho Washington Post says, that In the center of the stone block was a small square hole. The Missouri delegation was piesent to watch the placing of the statue, and one of the congressmen, fishing through his pockets, found a cent. He put the coin in the square hole, and also deposited a bit of paper with his autograph. Tho example was contagious. Every member of the dele gation put in a cent and his name, some curious bystanders did likewise, and by the time that the statue was placed in position there was almost enough copper in the pedestal to sheathe a ship. Prefrcs nnil Povertv. From the Boston Globe. A writer in the Arena makes the ven erable Lafayette say In 1S2", from the balcony of an old house, still standing at the corner of Park and Beacon streets in this city, "Where are your poor? Where are your poor? In this assembly I see them not. Why have they not come also?" Then some one in the crowd replied. "We are all here.rlch and poor together." But with true French gallantry the ven erable Frenchman responded: "No; the poor are not here. They are not anywhere in America. They arc In Europe." Upon the basis of this little scene the writer remarks: "And that makes the dif ference between an assembly of free men in 125 and an assembly of Inchoate pau pers in 3197." In a native tribe of barbarians there are no poor and no rich. In the tribal stage of civilization members of the tribe all share alike henco there is no poverty. But it does not follow tint this is the most desirable condition of existence. There are very few men living who can remember how an average crowd on the streets of Boston looked in 1S23. That they looked better fed, better dressed, or carried mere chinge In their pockets, few believe That there was more equ ility is due partly to the more elementary chir acter of trade and industry. It is always so. from the original tribe up to the most complex civilization But it is these complex conditions that call out the displavs of philanthropy tint we see on Thanksgiving d iv nnd in the holld ty season In saying that there were no poor In Boston in 1S23 (if he said it). Lifayette was bound to be polite, but we all know better. Inequality Increases as society nelvinces from the elementary to the complex. And so does pliil inthropy. But because of this are we prepired to return to the original tribil condition? Hardly. It is in the ef fort to remove inequility nnd ameliorate its effect that should engage every good citizen, th it the whole moral nature of the community is advanced with the increase of its material wealth. A Point of Theater Manner. From the Chicago Record If any inspired lawmikcr ever feels moved to emulate the celebrated Plotke of theatrical fame ho may perform a val uable service by- directing legislation against a custom th it is altogether too common among American thatergoers. It is the practice of trying to Ieuve the the ater just before the performance closes. The habit flourishes in all American cities alike. With n trained instinct the theiter goer recognizes that the end of tho plij Is at hand. It matters not what the chir acter of the perform mco. It maj- be comic opera or tragedy, the comedian may be reciting his epilogue or Juliet may- be breathing her last on Romeo's cadaver. Tho fact which impresses itself upon the theatergoer is that the curtain will fall In a moment nnd that unless he is out in the aisle, coated gloved and hat in hand he may lose as much as two whole minutes In getting to the street. The fact that he is supposed to be giving the evening to leisurely pleasure and th it if the perform ance were to last half an hour longer he would probibly remain and cheerfully- sac rifice the time does not deter him. The idea thit at worst he can be detained only five minutes Is not to be considered. The one urgent necessity- is that he be out on the street three or four minutes before any one else. Once there, he mav- piss fifteen minutes waiting for a car or devote an hour or more to a late supper. He saves time, no doubt, but the effect of his anxious haste Is a confuseil rustle of preparation which sweeps over the audi ence in the last moments of the perform ance, disconcerting the performers and an noying people who are less feirful of losing a few seconds in getting to the doors. Now thit the big hat has been suppressed, theater mamgers might turn their atten tion to discouraging the hasty exit practice. ;i)cerinnecl Xne-clne- I,j mpli. From the Chicago Tribune. The foreign dispatches recently containeil an announcement from London that Dr. Monkton Copeman. inspector of the Eng lish local government boirel. had discov ered a means of sterilizing vaccine Ivmph by mixing glycerine with It. which not only destroys bacteria but increases the efficacy of the lymph. It was further stateel that Lord Lister, an eminent surgeon of antiseptic fime, had informed the Royal Socletv "tint the government is likely to propose legislation to give the public the full benefit of the discovery." It now appears, however, from the bi ennial report of the Chicago health depart ment forlsy-C as well as from the report for May. 1SJ7. tint the glycerinated vac cine Ivmph has not onlv been used with success in this citv. but was dlscov creel here during July, 1SS3. bv Dr. Frank W. Reillv. assistant commissioner of the heilth dep irtment. who began using it in August of tint yeir. and thit snce that date more than ifiono vaccinations have been performed. Dr. Garrett, the vaccina tor of the department, savs of it: "I have noted in using this glycerine Ivmph a dim inution of the usu il inll imm ition sur rounding the vaccine xeslcle; lps fever and constitutional disturbance: entire free dom from abscesses, ulcers, swollen gl mils, and inflamed Ivmph vessels The dreaded 'sore arm of vicclnation is a thing of the past in Chicago. The use of the liquid lymph has revolutionized the practice of vaccination in this city, and it is due to this that our population is now the best protected against smallpox of any in the world." It thus appears from Indubitable testimony that the English doctor. Monk ton Copeman. Is not the discoverer of the glycerinated vaccine at all nnd that the English medical profession is claiming a discovery which belongs to Chicago. Dr. Reilly must be credited with being the first to apply this admixture, which not only has eliminated all danger from vaccination, as to its immediate or after results, but has proved an Invaluable preventive of the disease, as well as a modifying agent. Dr. Reilly- has been altogether too modest In not announcing the discovery and its ap plication in a more public manner than through the reports of his department. If he had done nothing else during his career as a physician nnd sanitarian this alone would have made his record a notable one. Vindication for Spofforil. From the Chicago Post. Time rarely bring3 to a man accused, so perfect a vindication as that which, nfter much criticism, comes to Ainsworth R. Spofford, formerly- librarian of congress. He was 72 years old when it was an nounced In public that he was short In his accounts. There was some $30 000 for which it was Impossible to account. Since 1SG3 he had been librarian of congress. Through all that .time he was known as a student, ns a scholar, as a man peculiarly unresponsive to the blandishments of so ciety and indifferent to that temptation for display which moves manj- men at a nation's capital. Yet the money had come to him. and he had not accounted for It. Where had it gone? Was this hut another Mr. Hjde to discourage and dishearten all who believed in Dr. Jekjll? The gentle, absorbed, studious old man seemed to have lived too long. Yet he had not lived long enough. Less than a. jear from the time his alleged "shortage" was announced his successor In offlce finds the first solution of the puz zle. Closed in a book here, wrapped up Rith papers there, tucked awaj- in un used pigeon-holes everj where, are monej' orders delivered to Mr. Spofford, but un cashed. Somn of them are-, twenty-two y ears old. Some are for considerable sums of money. And taken altogether they rep resented the sum for which he had been unable to account. Devoted to books, he knew nothing of bookkeeping. Interested in study, he for got the trifling vouchers which meint so much that he could not realize. Absorbed in a mighty- task, he had left uncompleted what seemed to him the least Important thing, and had forgotten to count tho money. Of course he instantly- squared the account from his own pocket; but he did not understand how it had happened. It Is most gratifying to know that Mr. Spofford has lived to see his vindication. It would have been a grave misfortune hid he passed awav with even the ghost of a shadow upon his name. ('nnnlp at the CInb. From the Cleveland Leader.
