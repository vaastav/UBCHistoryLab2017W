The interests involved are of great importance to the 'American fishing industry, and the final settlement .of the controversy, will President William H. Taft, Whose First Message Was Read in Congress Today. remove a source of constant Irritation ' and complaint. This is the first case Involving such great international questions which has been submitted to Jthe permanent court of arbitration at J, The Hague. ! The treaty between the United States . and Great Britain concerning the Ca nadian international boundary, con- "cluded April 11, 1908, authorizes the appointment of two commissioners to define and mark accurately the inter national boundary line between the ; i United States and the Dominion of Canada in the waters of the Passama Jquoddy bay and provides for the ex- ' change of briefs within the period of ' six months. The briefs were duly pre iffiented within the prescribed period, but as the commissioners failed to agree within six months after the ex change of the printed statements, as 'required by the treaty, it has now be- ' ficome necessary to resort to the arbl litraticn provided for in the article. The, international fisheries commls- -Elon appointed pursuant to and under ;the authority of the convention of JAprll 11, 1908, between the United J States and Great Britain has com- . 'pleted a system of uniform and com- Jmon international regulations for the '. 'protection and preservation of the food j Joshes in international boundary wa ' ,"ters of the United States and Canada. :j The regulations will be duly submit ted to congress with a view to the enactment of such legislation as will I be necessary under the convention to ' ipnt them into operation. ! j: The convention providing for the set- Uoment of International differences be- j tween the United States and Canada, jineluling the apportionment between the two countries of certain of the 5 iiboundary waters and the appointment c'of commissioners to adjust . certain ' 'other questions, signed en the 11th day ,';of January, 1909, a ad to the ratifica Httion of which the. senate gave its ad- vice and consent on March 8, 1909, has not yet been ratified on the part of Great Britain. ijfefe? Never kj Commissioners have been appointed on the part of the United States to act Jointly with commissioners on the part of Canada in examining into the ques tion of obstructions in the St John river-between Maine and New Brunswick- and to make recommendations for' the regulation of the uses thereof and are now engaged in this work. Protecting the Seals, j Negotiations for an International conference to consider and reach an arrangement providing for the preser vation and protectiotr of the fur seals In the" north ; Pacific are in progress with the governments of Great Britain, Japan and Russia. The attitude, of ,the" governraehts Interested"' leads " ine to hope for aatlsfactory settlement of this question as the ultimate outcome of the negotiations. The second peace conference recent-, lyheld at .The. Hague adopteda con vention ,fortte- establishment of an in ternatlonalyprize court upon the joint proposal of delegations of the United States, France, Germany and Great Britain, The law to be observed by the tribunal in the decision of prize cases was, however, left in an uncer tain and therefore unsatisfactory state. Article 7 of the convention provided that the court was to be governed by the provisions of treaties existing be tween the belligerents, but that "In the absence of such ' provisions the court shall apply the rules' of inter nation . law. If no .generally, recog- wax nized rule exists the court shall give judgment in, accordance with the gen eral principles of justice and equity." As, however, many questions In Inter national maritime law are understood differently and therefore interpreted differently in various countries, it was deemed advisable, not to Intrust legis lative powers to" the proposed court, but to determine the rules of law prop erly applicable lh a conference of the representative maritime nations. Pur suant to an invitation of Great Britain a conference was held at London from Dec. 2, 190S, to Feb. 23, 3909, in which the following powers participated: The United States, Au?trla-nungary, France Germany.. Great Britain. Italy. Japan, : the" ' Netherlands. "Kussia and Spain. The conference resulted m the declaration of London, unanimously agreed to and signed by the participat ing powers, concerning, among other I matters, the highly important subjects or Diocnaae, contra oauu, tue uesuue tlon of neutral prizes and continuous voyages. The declaration of London Is an emi nently satisfactory codification of, the international maritime law, and It is hoped that Its reasonableness and fair ness will secure lt3 general adoption, as well as remove one of the difficul ties standing in the way of the estab lishment of an international prize court. Under the authority given in the sundry civil appropriation act, ap proved March 4, 1909, the United States was represented at the inter national conference on maritime law at Brussels. The conference met on the 2Sth of September last and result ed In the signature ad referendum of a convention for the unification of cer tain regulations with regard to mari time assistance and salvage and a con vention for the unification of certain rules with regard to collisions at sea. Two new projects of conventions which have not heretofore been con sidered In a diplomatic conference namely, one concerning the limitation of the rej ponsibility of shipowners and the other concerning marine mort gages and privileges have been sub mitted by the conference to the dif ferent governments. The conference adjourned to meet gain on April 11. 1910. The international conference for the purpose of promoting uniform legisla tion concerning letters of exchange, which was called by the government of the Netherlands to meet at The nague In September, 1909, has been postponed to meet at that capital In June, 1910. The United States will be appropriately represented In this con ference under the provision therefor already made by conarress. The cordial Invitation of Belgium to be represented by a fitting display of American progress in the useful arts and Inventions at the world's fair to be held at Brussels In 1910 remains to be acted upon by the congress. Mind ful of the advantages to accrue to our artisans and producers in competition with their continental rivals, I renew the recommendation heretofore made that provision be made for acceptance of the invitation and adequate repre sentation in the exposition. 

REFORMS li! THE KONGO. Attitude of the United States One ef Benevolemt Encouragement. The question arising out of the Bel gian annexation of the Independent State of the Kongo, which has so long and earnestly preoccupied the atten tion of this government and enlisted the sympathy of our best citizens, is still open, but in a more hopeful stage. This government was among the fore most In the great work of uplifting the uncivilized regions of Africa and urging the extension of the benefits of civilization, education and fruitful open commerce to that vast domain and Is a party to treaty engagements of all the Interested powers designed to carry out that great duty to human ity. The way to better the original and adventitious conditions, so bur densome to the natives and so de structive to their development, has been pointed out, by observation and experience, not alone of American rep resentatives, but by cumulative evi dence from nil quarters and by the In vestigations of Belgian agents. The announced programs of reform?, striking at many of the evlla know to exist, are an augury of better things. The attitude of the United States is one of benevolent encourage ment, coupled with a hopeful trust that the good work, responsibly under taken and zealously perfected to the accomplishment of the results so ardently desired, will soon justify the wisdom that inspires them and satisfy the demands of humane sentiment throughout the world. German Patent. A convention between the United States and Germany, under which the nonworking provisions of the German patent law are made inapplicable to the patents of American citizens, was concluded on Feb. 23, 1909, and Is now in force. Negotiations for similar con ventions looking to the placing of American inventors on the s..' foot ing as nationals have recently been initiated with other European govern ments whose laws require the local working of foreign patents. Under an appropriation made at the last session of the congress a commis sion rvas sent on American cruisers to Mourovia to Investigate the interests of the United States and its citizens In Liberia. Upon its arrival at Monrovia the commission was enthusiastically received and during it3 stay in Li beria was everywhere met with the heartiest expressions of good will for the American government and people, and the hope was repeatedly expressed on all sides that this government might see its way clear to do some thing to relieve the critical position of the republic arising in a measure from external as well as internal and finan cial embarrassments. The Liberian government afforded every facility to the commission for ascertaining the true state of affairs. The commission also had conferences with representative citizens, interest ed foreigners and the representatives of foreign governments In Monrovia. Visits were made to various parts of the republic and to the neighboring British colony of Sierra Leone, where the commission was received by and conferred with the governor. Helping Liberia. It will be remembered that the In terest of the United States in the re public of Liberia springs from the his torical fact of the foundation of the republic by the colonization of Ameri can citizens of the African race. In an early treaty with Liberia there Is a provision under which the United States may be called upon for advice or assistance. Pursuant to this provi sion and in the spirit of the moral re lationship of the United States to Liberia that republic last year asked this government to lend assistance in the solution of certain of their national problems, and hence the commission was sent. The report of our commissioners has just been completed and is now under examination by the department of 6tate. It is hoped that there may re sult some helpful measures, in which case it may be my duty again to invite your attention to this subject. The Norwegian government, by a note addressed on Jan. 23, 1909, to the department of state, conveyed an Invi tation to the government of the United States to take part in a conference which it is understood will be held In February or March, 1910, for the pur pose of devising means to remedy ex isting conditions in the Spitzbergen islands. This invitation was conveyed under the reservation that the question of, altering the status of the Islands as countries belonging to no particular state and as equally open to the citi zens and subjects of all states should not be raised. The European powersi invited to this conference by the government of Nor way were Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia, Swe den and the Netherlands. The department of state, in view of proofs filed with it in 1906, showing the American possession, occupation and working of certain coal bearing lands in Spitzbergen, accepted the in vitation under the reservation above stated and under the further reserva tion that all interests in those Islands already vested should be protected and that there should be equality, of ODDortunity for the future. It was further pointed ' out that" membership in the conference on the part of the United States was qualified by the consideration that this government would not become a signatory to any conventional arrangement concluded by the European members of the con ference which would imply , contribu tory participation by the United States in any obligation or responsibility for the enforcement of any scheme of ad ministration which might be devised by the conference for the Islands. The Nr East. His maJesfMehmud V., sultan o2 Turkey, recently sent to this country a special embassy to announce hia ac cession. The quick transition of the government of the Ottoman empire from one of retrograde tendeneVs to a constitutional government with a par liament and with progressive modern policies of reform and public improve ment is one of the Important phenome na of our times. Constitutional gov ernment seems also to have made further advance in Persia. These events have turned the eyes of the world upon the near east. In that quarter the prestige of the United States has spread widely through the peaceful influence of American schools, universities and missionaries. There is every reason why we should obtain a greater share of the commerce of the near east since the conditions are more favorable now than ever before, Latin America. One of the happiest events In recent pan-American diplomacy was the pa cific, Independent settlement by the governments of Bolivia and Peru of a boundary difference between them, which for some weeks threatened to cause war and even to entrain lm bitterments affecting other republics less directly concerned. From various quarters, directly or indirectly con cerned, the Intermediation of the United States was sought to assist In g solution of the controversy. Desir ing at all times to abstain from any undue mingling in the affairs of sister republics and having faith in the abil ity of the governments of Peru and Bolivia themselves to settle their dif ference in a manner satisfactory to themselves which, viewed with mag nanimity, would assuage all lmbitter ment, this government steadily ab stained from being drawn into the controversy and was much gratified to find its confidence justified by events. On the 9th of July next there will open at Buenos Aires the fourth pan American conference. This conference will have a special meaning to the hearts of all Americans because around its date are clustered the anni versaries of the Independence of so many of the American republics. It is not necessary for me to remind the congress of the political, social and commercial importance of these gath erings. You are asked to make liberal appropriation for our participation. If this be granted it is my purpose to appoint a distinguished and representa tive delegation qualified - fittingly to represent this country and.to deal with 1 the problems of Intercontinental In terest which will there be discussed. The Argentine Republic will also hold from May to November, 1910, at Buenos Aires a grnt International agricultural exhibition, in which the United States lias been invited to par ticipate. Considering the rapid growth of the trade of the United States with the Argentine Republic and the cor- j dial relations existing between the two nations, together with the fact that It provides an opportunity to show def erence to a sister republic on the oc casion of the celebration of its national independence, the proper departments of this government are taking steps to apprise the Interests concerned of the opportunity .afforded by this exhibi tion, in which apprepriate participa tion by this country is so desirable. The designation of an official repre sentative is also receiving considera tion. PAN-AMERICAN POLICY. Monroe Doctrine Not For Perpetua tion of Irresponsible Government. Today more than ever before Amer ican capital is seeking Investment in foreign countries, and American prod ucts are more and more generally seek ing foreign markets. As a conse quence in all countries there are Amer ican citrtens and American interests to be protected on occasion by their government. These movements of men, of capital and of commodities bring peoples and governments closer togeth er and so form bonds of peace and mu tual dependency, as they must also naturally sometimes make passing points of friction. The resultant sit uation inevitably Imposes upon this government vastly increased responsi bilities. This administration, through the department of state and the. for eign service, is lending all proper sup port to legitimate and beneficial Amer ican enterprises in foreign countries, the degree of such support being meas ured by the national advantages to be expected. A citizen himself cannot by contract or otherwise divest hlm eelf of the right, nor can this govern ment escape the obligation, of his pro tection in his personal and property rights when these are unjustly in fringed in a foreign country. To avoid ceaseless vexations it is proper that In considering whether American enter prise should be encouraged or support ed in a particular country the govern ment should give full weight not only to the national as opposed to the indi vidual benefits to accrue, but also to the fact whether or not the govern ment' of the country in question is in Its administration and in its diplomacy faithful to the principles of modera tion, equity and justice upon which alone depends international credit In diplomacy as well as in finance. The pan-American policy of this government has long been fixed In its principles and remains unchanged. With the changed circumstances of the United States and of the republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable govern ment and .progressive Ideals, the ap prehension which gave rise to the Monroe doctrine may be said to have nearly disappeared, and neither the doctrine as it exists nor any other doc trine of American policy should be permitted to operate for the perpetua tion of irresponsible government, the escape of Just obligations or the lnsidi ous allegation of dominating ambitions on the part of the United States. Beside the fundamental doctrines of our pan-American policy there have grown up a realization of political in terests, community of Institutions and Ideals and a flourishing commerce. All these bonds will be greatly strength ened as time goes on and increased facilities, such as the great bank soon to be established in Latin America. supply the means for bnilding up the colossal intercontinental commerce of rthe future. My meeting with President Diaz and the greeting exchanged on both Amer ican and Mexlean soil served, I hope, to signalize the close and cordial rela tions which so well bind together this republic and the great republic Imme diately to the south, between which there Is so vast a network of material interests. I am happy to say that all but one of the cases which for so long vexed our relations with Venezuela have been settled within the past few months and that, under the enlight ened regime now directing the govern ment of Venezuela, provision has been made for arbitration of the remaining case before The Hague tribunal. On July 30, 1909, the government of Panama agreed, after considerable ne gotiation, to indemnify the relatives of the American officers and Bailors who were brutally treated, one of them having. Indeed, been killed, by the Tanaman police this year. The sincere desire of the government of Panama to do away with a situation where such an accident could occur Is manifest In the recent request in com pliance with which this government has lent the services of an officer of the army to be employed by the gov ernment of Panama as Instructor of police. The sanitary Improvements and pub lic works undertaken In Cuba prior to the present administration of that gov ernment, in the success of which the United States is Interested under the treaty, are reported to be making good progress, and since the congress pro vided for the continuance of the recip rocal commercial arrangement be tween Cuba and the United States assurance has been received that no negotiations injuriously affecting the situation will be undertaken without consultation. The collection of the customs of the Dominican Republic through the gen eral receiver of customs appointed bj the president of the United States in accordance with the convention of Feb. 8. K.I07, has proceeded In an un eventful and satisfactory manner. The customs receipts have decreased owinsr to disturbed political and economic conditions and to a very natural cur tailment of Imports In view of the an ticipated revision of the Dominican tariff schedule. The payments to the fiscal agency fund for the service of the bonded debt of the republic, as provided by the convention, have been regularly and promptly made, and sat isfactory progress has been made In carrying out the provisions of the con vention looking toward the completion of the adjustment of the debt and the acquirement by the Dominican govern mentof certain concessions and mo nopolies which hava been a burden to the commerce of the couutry. In short, the receivership has demonstrated Its ability, even under unfavorable eco nomic and political conditions, to do the work for which it was intended. This government was obliged to In tervene diplomatically to bring about arbitration or settlement of the claim of the Emery company against Nica ragua, which it had long before been agreed should be arbitrated. A settle ment of this troublesome case was reached by the signature of a protocol on Sept 18, 1909. Claim Against Chile. Many years ago diplomatic interven tion became necessary to the protec tion of the interests in the American claim of AIsop & Co. against the government of Chile. The govern ment of Chile had frequently admitted obligation in the case and had prom ised this government to settle it. There had been two abortive attempts to do so through arbitral commissions, which failed through lack of jurisdiction. Now, happily, as the result of the re cent diplomatic negotiations, the gov ernments of the United States and of Chile, actuated by the sincere desire to free from any strain those cordial and friendly relations upon which both st such store, have agreed by a proto col to submit the controversy to defini tive settlement by his Britannic majes ty Edward VII.
