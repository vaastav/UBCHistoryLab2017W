change In the speclflcations cations of the contract according t anI I explanation of the details tonight Is thereduction reduction of the bond re < ulrod from 3000 000 t I 2000000 Chairman ShonU and

bidders cutlet have 1 capital of 5000000Another Tt bond however Is a part of the capialnothlr Another Important change concerns material forbid which the contractor believes to bedefective defective The altered form of controtprvld provide that if tho contractor finds anymaterial material which he believes defective honhall nhall notify the chief engineer of the commiHsion miHsion who i tho Government superwritten visor 01 the work and cal upon him forwrtten written approval of tho material Ihenif if after tho material is used it proves defective feotive and ban to b replaced or

posMibilityof of thewage scale on the IfthmiiM fluctuatingThe The compensation of the bidder who getsthe the contract depends upon tho total rootof of tho work and the length of time it takesto to

I basa UK estimates of the proper cost andttio ttio proper length of time for completion ofthe the work They declared that some of theIJrings I wrings that have been made might proveerroneous

hi providedthat that tho President under such circumstances stances may assemble the engineeringcommittee committee or a new one In case the original nal body in not available and direct themto to revise the estimates of cost and timefor for completion of the work in accordancewith with the new facts concerning the physicalcharacter character of work to be done This provision vision will work
