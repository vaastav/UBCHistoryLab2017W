FRANCE HAS NO KLONDIKE Alexandra Itibat Oeclnrca That She 3Iust Cut Mown Her Expenses. Paris, 'Dec. 5. The last three sittings of the chamber of deputies have been devoted to a consideration of the budget. The discussions on the whole were unin teresting until today, when Alexandre Rlbot (Republican), made a slashing crit icism of the bOI. M. Ribot argued that the present budget was higher by 250,090, 000 francs than that of 1S98; that ail the nations of Europo were reducing ex penses, and that France must imitate their example, as she cannot risk com mitting further faults. The only way to assure the moral and material strength of the nation, argued tho speaker, is to prevent the expenditures from exceeding the receipts. M R'bot criticised the at tempts to effect economy by abolishing the sugar bounties and the appropriations for public worship. He declared that most of the economics proposed were more fictious than real; that the deficit at the end of the year would be 144 mil lion francs, and thai the government owed ihe country the truth concerning the condition of its finances at RIbot's speech made a great im pression upon the chamber, and he re ceived an ovation when he concluded.

CLASHES BETWEEN ORDERS Are Settled Satisfactorily to All Disputants, Scranton, Pa., Dec 5. Two hundred and elghty-flve delegates, representing more than a million and a half work men, responded to the rollcal! at the opening session of the twenty-first an nual convention of the American Federa tion of Labor, which was called to order by President Samuel Gompers, in St. Thomas College Hall at 10:30 o'clock this morning. The convention is said to be the largest congress of workmen ever held in this country. Organization, set tlement of questions Involving contested seats, and the reading of the annual re port of the president, secretary and treasurer, took up the entire time of the convention. During the course of tho day there was one surprise sprung on the delegates and one important decision was also made. The surprise came in the form of an objection to the seating of the United Mine "Workers' delegates be cause of an alleged arrearage on their percapita tax. The objection was over ruled by an almost unanimous vote of tho dplegates. The important question decided related to the contested seat of the delegates from the Central Labor Union of Richmond, Va., which body refused to admit a negro workman to its organization. The dispute was ad justed by seating the Contral Labor the executive board of the American Union representative and instructing tho executive board of the American Federation of Labor to form a separate Central Union for the colored men. When tho names of the delegates rep resenting the United Mino "Workers of America were reached tho roll call, a stir was caused by C. L. Shamp, of Chicago. International Secretary-Treasurer of the Brotherhood of Stationary Firemen, ob jecting to their being seated. He main tained that the Mine Workers were not entitled to representation in the con vention because the percapita tax of f 1,000 1 had not been paid to the federation. President Mitchell, of the Mine Workers, replied that his organization was not asking for special privileges. Several thousand of its members were, on a strike almost continually for th past two years and he said he had asktd the execute.- board to.remlt the ley because the min ers had paid an as. ssment of .' f'-r j the aid of the machinists. He saH if ' the committee decid'-d that hi? orsraniza- J tion was in arrears, he would lmmedi- , ately draw a check for th- amount da.. The matter went no furtht r. and bv ." almost unanimous vote the coal min.i-' representatives were seated. The negro question came before the convention in the shape of a report from the committee on rr- -let Mal 'A'.l liam E.

The report notes a grawing tendency to agreements in industry.. To create a defense fund it recommends changing the Federatfrm's constitution so as to admit of a larger assessment and the levy by the executive council early in the year of a portion of the assessment provided so that a fund mal be at the disposition at any time in the interests of any of tho affiftated organisations engaged In a practical struggle which they could not singly support. It also recommends authorizing a commltte! with representatives of the Western Fed oration of Miners looking to their affilia tion. The report denounces the employ ment of young children, and contends for greater organization among women workers. Mr. Gompers says he has arranged an active campaign for the reenactment of the Chinese exclusion act, and expresses surprise at the 'patience of the Pacific coast citizens in submitting to a state of affairs so horrible and degrading." He arraigns Chinese immigrants as low cring American standards. Treasurer Lennon's report showed an Increase of $126,522; expenses, ?11S,70S; total funds at hand,

LESSON WELL Chamberlain Talks at Recep tion Given Prince and Wife. DOESN'T MENTION NATION Prince Himself Addresses a Notable Gathering on Trip. LOVE OF THE COLONIES For Motherland Subject, Fon died by Englishmen. London, Dec 5. The city entertained the Prince and Princess of Wales today at a luncheon given In the Guild hall, and presented them with an address of con gratulation on their successful tour of the British empire. The Royal party drove from York house to the Guild hall in an open four horse landau, escorted by life guards. They were met everywhere with the heartiest reception from the sightseers lining the brilliantly bedecked and troop ing guards on the route. The scene In the library of the corporation's historic puarters where their royal highnesses were received by the lord mayor. Sir Joseph C. Dimsdale, and the corporation was picturesque. Levee or diplomatic dress, uniforms or judicial robes were worn by the majority of the guests, among whom were the agents general of the colonies. Prominent among the other notables present were Lord Salisbury, Lord Roseberry and Mr. and Mrs. Cham berlain. Tho reception was made the occasion of a demonstration in favor of the gov ernment and of Mr. Chamberlain, the colonial secretary, as well as of empha sizing the loyalty of the colonies and their devotion to Great Britain. It was a purely family affair, no foreign diplo mats being invited, but the Englishmen present Include most of tho notables of country. The Prince of "Wales wore tho full uniform of a rear admiral The Princess was dressed In black brocade velvet, relieved by a long chain of dia monds. The lord mayor and aldermen wore their state robes. Seated in the vicinity of the Prince and Princess of Wales were Lord Salisbury. In the Wind sor uniform, and Lord Roseberry and the Duke of Devonshire, in the same uniform, with the broad ribbon of the Garter, and Mr. Chamberlain in court uniform. The Prince of Wales seized tho oppor tunity to make a speech on the relations between the motherland and the colonies, re-viewing the experience of his tour and emphasizing the lessons to be learned from it. He referred to each colony he had visited, and in speaking about the dominion said: "To Canada was borne the message already conveyed to Austra lia aid New Zealand of the motherland's loving appreciation of the services ren dered by its gallant sons. In the journey lrom ocean to ocean, marvelous in its comfort and organization, wo were en ni . to toe something of Its matrhless s-eenery, the rhhness of Its soil and the toundless pessih. lilies t that vast and 1 'it partly exjlorod territory." The pri. ice's-ad !r?ss made a most fa vor iMe inipr-'Ss:o:! upon the audience. Mr. Chamberlain was accorded a tre ner.dous rc pt'on hen he rcse to r-f-pond to Lord Koseberry's toast to the colonies, hut neither he nor Lord Rcse Vcrry raid anything of international lm- ort.tt.ee. Lord Roseb"rry alone referred to the t .pic of which e-. ery cne was thinking, namely. England's unpopularity abr&ad. He nai.l: ".No doubt it is true.
