We iuert on another page tho prospectus fthe "tVhukly KKPunLicAN, which, tu U therein set forth, will be Issued on Thurs day, the 3d of January, 1878, on a niam mouth aheet of eight page. This publica tion will contain a great tariely of political end mUoellancous reading matter, and In politics it will be thoroughly and decidedly (Republican according to the most orthodox tenets of the faith. The 1'rMldcnt'a M engage. We give tho full text of the President's Annual message to Congress to the readers if The National IUpudlican this morn ing. "We commend It to tho candid perusal ef every intelligent American citizen. It Is an Important and well-composed public document, which presents In t main a Yry candid and explicit tIow otTthe part f the Executive of the condition of the wintry, accompanied by such suggestions and recommendations to the law-making ower as In his Judgment Is demanded by te circumstances of the occasion. We are not prepared at this moment, owing to a want of time and room, to treat of the Tarious questions involved In this document much at length. We see in It at a glance some things to commend and others to dissent from ; but, u a whole, the document Is highly creditable to the states manship and the literary culture of the Executive. It Is not without its merits and Its fallacies, all of which we may take time and occasion to discuss in the future In a fearleas and frank manner, under a de termination to "render unto Cceaar the things that are Cesar's," and unto the popu lar Interests of the country the things that properly belong to them. Our sense of Jus tice to the national welfare will not permit us to commend with partisan partiality much that Is suggested and recommended, for we think it in consistent with the material interests of the country; but we- hope to temper our criti cisms with a spirit of candor which will how that while we disagree with some of the propositions put forth on the questions of Internal policy taking, for instance, the practical workingsof the so-called Southern policy, the civil service reform, and the problems of finance we ore disposed to urge our views, and then so far to agree to disagree. It affords as plcasnre to notice that the Fresldent discusses the duties of the Government- toward the District of Columbia In an Intelligent, liberal, and catholic spirit, lie holds to n Just appreciation of the ex isting relations between the Government and the District, and what is due to its people from Congress. His suggestions and recommcrfdatfons are wise and jnst, and do credit both to his head and heart, and we trust will bear with proper weight upon tho future action of the law-making power. When Did It Hcstn? It Is difficult to decide Just when tho conspiracy which has engaged so much pub lic attention recently did begin, and hence its begiuning and ending are neither clearly defined in the mists of history. h 1875 the affairs in Louisiana had become so tur bulent and alarming ns to call for tntestl- ' gal ion, and a sub-corn ml ttee, consisting of Memrs. Phkuti, Foster, and Vari er, was sent there for that purpose. These gtmtle- men were at once captured by the Demo crats, who plied them with generous atten tlons and other seductive influences to an extent that greatly dimmed their visions and interfered with a clearness of ight In looking Into matters. Their report was strongly tinted with Democratic coloring, and did not provo satisfactory to the aver age intelligence of the Kepublicnn party.

We hire Wen tlins exptkit In regard to the public services and stauding of our cor rerondent that those who are not acquainted with him and his history may havo a better appreciation of the weight that attaches to his views and opinions, which are outspoken and manly, and we think eminently perti nent to the hour: Little Kocx, Axr., Nor. 39, 1577. lion, A.M. Clappt Dear Six: In the National Kepublican of the SUt instant you comment upon the question, "Who is responsible for tho crushing out of tho Republican party at the South?' and your view of tho sltuatlou will be accepted as the truth by ninety-nine one hundredths of sllSonthern BepubHiatu, whether they hold 0 nice or not. In the present anomalou condition of affairs this latter class wttl preserve tho silence that profound respect for their salarlos demands; but at he Jit tbey proUbty think as little or the President's blunder as the rest of us. To cure a disease Is one thing, to kill the pa tient another ; and this particular attempt to emancipate voters from an alleged control by office holders will be tha greatest btlure In American politics. Jt would be a misnomer to call It statesmanship. Here In Arkansas, as elsewhere In the South, we have sufferod from the misconduct of offi cials, and the confidence of the masses has been given to soma Republicans who have not proven to be worthy of it; put, nevertheless, no one thinks of operating a party without the general aid of those who receive the honors and enjoy the emoluments of public station. 'That order" has accomplished all you charge to It, and, Instead of resulting la the 'emancipation of tho action of voters from the control of office-holders," it has operated In the South at least like a dcath-darap. and down here Republicans stand aghast at the future, and fcol that uutoss the high chiefs of the party at Washington and throughout the North protest against this surrender to the Democracy, (for this Is practically whtt It Is,) and unless there shall be a change of front by the administration, it will be a hopeless un dertaking, for two years at least, to revive the Republican party in the South, And yet whatever may be true of other Southern States, there are 40,000 Republican voters In this. The colored citizens, as a class, are disposed to be true to the Republican party. There are many Northern men scattered through the State who are true to It, and there are Southern Republicans who were ,llving here when the war broke out who are true to it. Bat tbe President seems to set as though the Northern men especially who are here are all of the speculative, good-for-nothing, dishonest clacs, and unworthy of his confidence. Yet It should never be forgotten that not only in Ar kansas, but all through the South, the close of the war left in the territory that they had aided to conquer, thousands of men, who per iled everything for the sake of their country, who abandoned their callings to defend the flag, and are now In the South In the most per fect good faith, and striving, each In his own way, to live and let live. " A pronounced Republican In the Southern States Is politically as obnoxious now as ever, and If he thinks proper to be active In a politi cal campaign he Is a radical'1 in what is attempted to be made an opprobrious senso of the term, aud no distinction Is drawn between thwe whose personal conduct Is above reproach and some men who unfortunately have once been trusted by their party, but never wilt be again. Party strife Is bitter, end those Democrats whose Confederate record is the clearest are the most trusted. The ruling element In the South believes, as It always has believed, that the American Union la simply a confed eracy of co equal States, and not a great and Indivisible nationality, and conciliation from this element In a party sense there Is not, from present Indications, the slightest hope to oxpect, and yet tho country Is witnessing an attempt by a Republican national ad minis tra tratlon to placate an adversary by methods that are as unwise In theory as they will pnn e to be utterly deceptive In practice, for the President's "policy," If It be a "policy," has now been fairly tried, and in this connec tion the New York Itmet docs Indeed present an accurate review of this overture to South ern Democrats, on tho one hand, and of tho collapsoof Southern Republicanism In certain of the cotton States on the other, Arkansas, moreover, can bo added to thellst, and when the Wellington correspondent of the Cincinnati Oatttte asks, What has Hwcs done to change the political situation n Ten- n!e'"r "'"'"'Pj!

JLMVSEMEXT3, The National. If aver folks enjoyed themselves the audi ence at the National last night did. If one may judge from the fact that they laughed and screamed and roared and applauded from the time the curtain went upon the first aot till thenas of the play, " Forbidden Fruit" Is without doubt Bond canity best comedy. It Is replete with fun and laughable situations throughout The comedians, William H. Crane and Stuart Rob eovrhave made this comedy the best that is now presented on the American stage. Crane as Sergeant Butter and EoUou as Giro Dove are young married men and ftreat frieuds. They dotermlne to have a frolic without the knowledge of their better halve, and then tho fun commences and goes on till the end. No harm Is done; no Immorality Is committed, and the most fastidious foil to find fault with any action or word of tho play. Crane and Kobson were never more funny than thoy were last evening. They are comedians of tho very first order, and richly deserveded the graud ovation with which they were received lat evening. Mrs. Uermon, Blanche Ford. Laura Joyce, Alccla Bolson, all did remarkably well, while the remainder of the company were well up In their lines for the first representation. If the renders of the BaruBUCAN really de sire te enjoy a hearty laugh, and drive dull care awar for an evening, they should by all means see Crane and Bolson, the Oherubt In ' Forbidden Fruit."
