York Tribunt proposes the liberated s'avet to Florida, there to be colonized and made useful, prosperous and happy. If the slates are to be colonized at 11, it is probable Florida ia as eood a place to send them as conld be selected. It has a fine climate, a rich soil, and can grow all kinds of tropical product, from oranges to cotton the rery artioles that the negro would prefer to raise to all others. Florida contains sixty -six thousand square miles, which makes it larger than Eng land and Wales. It has fewer white in habitants than Hamilton County, and could no doubt be colonized with colored people with fewer drawbacks than any other portion of our country. But the Albany Kniclttrbotlctr is opposed to the colonization scheme, and asks, Why should we colonize the slaves at all ? Why not let them be where they are? Their labor is as much needed in Georgia and South Carolina aa it ever was. Why, then, take the slave from tie land of his birth and ship him off to Florida or any other place? If we confiscate the plantations of those engaged in the re bellion, we confiscate the very laid which the confiscated slaves might and should till. The plantations referred to should bo divided up among lojal men in the army and ntfvy, and the slaves hired for eo much per month to work the eaid plantations. This is the beet and cheapest plan that cm be adopted. The colonization platform will be highly ex pensive, and never popular with the negroes. No man's love of home is stronger than the African's. This fact should be remembered by the Government, and nothing done which will cause this sentiment to render the move ment abortive. If we send the slaves to Florida, they will be unproductive for the first year at lec.st This would be a great expense to the Government, and highly de moralizing to the negroes. Let them remain on the confiscated plantations, and they be come a self-sustaining institution at once. On these plantations are the houses, tools, horses, mules and machinery to do up the year's work without expending a single dol lar. The Government should recollect the motto of Davy Crockett "Be sure you're right, then go ahead." A Present from a Cincinnatian to Illinois. Mr. L. C. Hopkins, of the firm of Cole & Hopkins of this city, has made the State of Illinois a present of a magnificent national flag, of full regulation sizo, twenty by thirty feet It is made ot the very best bunting, and will float proudly over the capital upon the next Union victory. In making mention cf this present the Illinois Slate Journal says that the above firm have filled large con tracts with that State for clothing, -Ac, for the troops, and that "honesty and fidelity has invariably characterized their dealings. Every thing they have furnished has been manufactured in the best manner, and of the beat material, and has been fully up to the standard they agreed to observe. They have given the Quartermaster no cause of com plaint in any respect, and their articles have lean furnished at much lower prices than have been paid in some other States. It is a fortunate circumstance, both for the treasury and for the troops, that the contracts for sup plies were awarded to this firm." Steam Fire Engines for Washington. The Government has determined' to order two steam fire engines for the City of Wash ington, each to be accompanied with several experienced men to operate and take care of it. The Fire Department in Washington has become disorganized, and this wise action is taken for the protection of the public buil dings. Had there been only one steam fire engine on band, it is stated the Infirmary, which was lately burned down in that city, would hare been saved. Why should not some of our mechanics have the contract for furnishing tht.se engines? Cincinnati has been somewhat overlooked in giving out Government work. Mittens. The knitting mania is general and should be kept up, and we have directions, and pat terns and diagrams. A lady friend says it is Strange some one does not suggest how easy it if, and how much better it is for those who understand It, to crochet the mittens. Many young ladies can crochet rapidly, who knit with painful slowness and slow painfullness, and then it is so much mote quick and easy. No taking off of stitches, no changing needles and knitting gores, but straight forward work. It is easy to crochet a pair in a day, and not as easy to knit a pair the same time. Please pass on the word crochet mittens! A Noble Work. The Ameiican Bible Society has done great work for the army and navy. It baa distributed, in these two branches ot the national service, about half a million copies of the Scriptures, mostly of the New Testa ment, and is now issuing seven thousand copiea a day. Every man in our volunteer regiments, who would receive one, has been furnished, as we are informed, with a very neat and portable copy of the New Testa ment ; and the lime good work is to be done for the other regiments that may yet volun teer in the . service of their country to the end of the war. So noble an object is worthy of every body's sympathy and co-operation. Important Law in Prospect. in Cotgress to the effect that no person can claim reimbursement from the Government for damages occasioned by the Federal troops in occupation ei land or otherwise, except anon as earnestly assist the Government putting down the rebellion. Many persons who have done all they could for the Con federate etuie, now that the Union is tri umphing again, are coming forward with heavy claim for damages. Some well known rebels are trying to dispose of their property clandestinely to avoid its confisca tion. - - - - ' Wa understand that engineers are now Surveying a railroad line from Covington, the Columbus and Piqua Road, to Richmond, led. !

The war has not drawn so largely upon the resources of the country as to shut out sympathy for suffering in other lands. In Ireland the crops have been so bad that the people are threatened with another famine, and the suffering is already very great. The Archbishop of Tuam has earnestly called the attention ot the British Government to the fact, but as yet measures of relief do not ap pear to be adopted. It is proposed in Mas sachusetts to send out a ship-load of food to the relief of those sufferers who have so many of their friends and relatives in this country. A retired sea-captain offers to give one hundred barrels of flour, and gratuitously command the vessel which will take the Paying Volunteers. Senator Wilson introduced a bill on Mon day, by one section of which the Paymaster General is authorized and required to detail an Assistant Paymaster to reside in each loyal State for the purpose of paying the families of the volunteers from that State their allotment, as it falls due. By another section, the President is authorized to ap point three persons from each State, to serve without pay, whose duty it shall be to visit the troops from their respective States and obtain the signatures of soldiers to allotment rolls. Cloaks and Dry Goods. Messrs. Deland & Gossage, who have one of the most extensive dry goods establish ments in the Western country, throw their banner to the world to-day in the columns of the Pm:ss. A continuous Btream of ladies in and out of their establishment establishes the fact that it is popular. And as evidence that they are liberal dealers, we may remark that they are among the most liberal adver tisers in the city. Revolutionary Soldiers. On the 1st of June last, according to the report of theCommissioner of Pensions, there were but sixty-three Revolutionary patriots on the "pension rolls, and that number by this time has no doubt been reduced to less than fifty. A few years more and the last of these old veterans will have been gathered with his patriotic brothers in the spirit land. We hope the last one, at least, will live to see the country again united and happy. The Confederate Capital. It is now reported that Richmond is still the rebel Capital, though bow long it will remain so ia uncertain. The report of a vote to remove it to Nashville, which came from rebel Ecurces, rj ay be explained, by the fact that the rebel Congress sits with closed doots, so that the world outside is sometimes wholly in the dark as to its action, and the rebels themselves are often deceived. Opposition to the President. A letter-writer in Washington states a movement is on foot among the ultra anti slavery party in Congress to organize an op position to President Lincoln's Administra tion. The President is fully advised and prepared for the onset. Tbi Union papers in Kentucky, including the Louisville Journal and Democrat, are very severe iu their denunciation of the President's Message and Secretary Came ron's Report. They object especially to the slavery portions of those documents to what they regard as a wink at emancipa tion from the President, and to the Secreta ry's proposition to arm the slaves. of in a in on to Tbb Secretary of the Navy, in his report just transmitted to Congress, states that we have 264 vessels, 2,557 guns, and 22,000 sea men, but he includes, in his list, receiving- ships and ships of the line that have been on the stocks since 1818. Mbb. Lincols has received a present ef a very contly bonnet from the ladies of New York. On the strings there is a likeness of old Abe, surrounded by wreaths and sur mounted by national emblems. Gehkbal Pbsntibs, in command at St, Joseph, Mo., has announced that every Se cessionist shall either take the oath of alle giance or be set at work on Federal fortifica tions. Asr order has been issued from the War Department, directing Adams & Co. to es tablish a depot at Port Royal, S. C, for the package express business. Tbi Logan Gazette says Fremont has divided the Republican party in the middle. It will be remembered that he parts his hair in the same manner. Anthony L. K.napp, Union Democrat, has been elected to Congress from the Sixth Illi nois District, in place of General McClernand, resigned. Rev. Dr. Michael!, of Covington, Ky has been appointed Chaplain of the Fifth Regi ment of United States Cavalry. Mobs Diabolical Wobk. We find this lUra in the Baltimore Clipper of yesterday We Irarn from one of the Lieutenants the Fifth Repiment New York Zouaves, that an attempt was made to poison with strrch- nine some, if not all their men, while in the neighborhood of Bellbaven. The Lieuten ant eeys the citizens had prepared about thiee hundred pies, in which they bad placed the poifon, and, had it not been for some of the negroes, the privates would hare eaten fieely of them, as they were short of pro visions just at that particular time, owing to their having to keep on the march. After it became known in their camp, (about two miles distant from foe town,) it was with the gieateBt difficulty that the Colonel and the respective Captains could control the men and prevent them from returning and burn ing the town; but after taking and keeping a strict watch over them, they finally suc ceeded in pacifying tbem.

Opposition to the President. A Chapter on Contrabands. The Virginia contrabands at Old Point Comfort are housed and fed at the expense of the Government, and lead a very con tented life; bot, if we may Judge by the statements of a correspondent of the National Intelligencer, they are too much engrossed in the enjoyment of the novel sensation of free dom to give any serious attention to hard labor. The Intelligencer' correspondent draws this picture of 

CONTRABANDS AT WORK. certainly very amusing to these contrabands engaged at what, in a measure, has been misnamed "work." In order to transport a bale ot bay a distance of from twenty to thirty yards it takes about eighteen or twenty laborers, men and boys, who perform the operation somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty minutes. First, one will give it a turn over, roll his body on it, drop down on his elbows, and have a quiet grin for several seconds. Then it will be passed to tbe next one, who proves to be a perfect genius in the art of imitation; and so on it goes through the whole gang. At times the gangs will suddenly grow small and beautifully less in consequence of some of tbe laborers having decided to amuse themselves a la Heenan, others having started off on a foot race, and more resolved on get ting np an impromptu circus. just atwut tins juncture a sergeant may oe seen recollecting the scapegoats by dint of a resort to his lungs. Not unfrenuently Mr. Contraband is made aware of the fact that there is an "all-seeing" eye, by having a brick pass his leg with considerable rapidity at a distance ratner too close tor personal comfort. When I describe how a bale of bay is unloaded, tbe description will serve as a very safe criterion by which to judge the manner in which every thing elBe iB removed ana Bioreu away, it is not unusual to sse bait a dczen negroes wheoling a band-cart gen erally with nothing in it; a coal cart backed up to a heap of lumber almost off the dock-, or into some other cart or wagon, rather than where it is wanted; eight or ten "darkeys" removing a stick of lumber, while the same number are engaged in warming their feet or dancing a jig; little ebonies hurrahing for some notability in the hope of getting a penny from a passing officer; more little blacks playing soldier, scampering after a band of music, or throwing; dust: and wenches swaggering:, grinning and canerine by tbe roadside, or coquetting with their lellows. The same, writer, however, admits that many of the negroes are intelligent and will ing. He gives this interesting account of the ABSURD STORIES TOLD TO SLAVES. One party, with which I entered into con versation, stated that their masters bad told them tbat, in tbe tventof their running away, tbey would be sold to the white female abo litionists of tbe IvoitQ tor husbands, and their wenches taken away from them and trans ferred to the men abolitionists for wives. On asking one of the party what he thought of such a story, he replied "that be bad not as yet seen any one sold, but tbat, if such should prove to be a fact, he did not know but that be could live just as well North as South. I conversed wiih 'varioiiB other parties, both free and bond, and almost all of tbem were well stored with absurd stories not at all dis similar to the one given above. Secretary Cameron's Report. The Washington correspondent of the Bos ton Journal gives the following as the way in which Secretary Cameron's report was changed. It may be gossip or fact, we know not which, but it is generally conceded tbat the Deport was changed: It is now known tbat when Secretary Seward read the wer report he objected to its treatment of tbe contraband question, and insisted on having tbe paragraphs ex putgfd. This Secretary Cameron at first refused to do, and it was not until eleven o'clock on Tuesday night that he consented, after having been told distinctly by the President that be must make tbe changes or resign. He then submitted to the emascula tion of his report, but with the knowledge tbat several hundred copies bad been sout to the principal cities, and that the terrors of imprisonment at rort warren or Lafayette would not muzzie toe press, -lccordiugiy. we have tbe report Simon pure, and the came document edited by Seward. The Stcretary of State played a hih game and won, but tbe Secretary ot War held the trick ai.d has tbe honor. It is also said tbat the President's messacw. as sent into Congress, was to some extent worked over by the secretary of State, and that he was virtually sustained by all of the Uabtnet except secretaries Cameron and Chase, Secretary Welles siding witn these gentlemen, but not wishing to enter into any controversy on a matter which the President couio decide. A promulgation of these facts has caused an advance iu conservative stock, but the more progressive Republicans are only tbe more earnest to carry their points, and tbey declare tbat Congiefs will adopt Cameron's policy. So we may expect a stormy session, but it is to be hoped tbat ere long there will be a harmonious concert of action, tor a di vided North iB just what tbe rebels have ever piayed for. A New Orleans Suggestion. of The New Orleans Cretccnt makes this sug gestion: "It Ib high time this city was purged of an persons woo express nortnern sympa thies, or who manifest joy at any trifling success of our enemies. If tbe forcible ar rest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell be not re eented forthwith by Great Britain, the Brit ish Consulate should be required to be closed in this city mstanter. The British Government has not sent a Consul to the Confederate States, and it is derocatorr on tbe part of tbe Confederate Government to 1 permit tbe residence among us of a British otnciai accredited to the Lincoln Uovern ment." In other words, if the rebels can not ob tain a recognition from England in any o'her way, they are ready to go to war with ber on their own account. in at be to Till Monboe Doctbini. As people at heme and abroad are continually mistaking tbe purport of this famous doctrine, we copy an accurate statement of it from tbe National Intelligencer, as follows: President Monroe never arrogated to tbe United States a monopoly of political con trol in the affairs of the American Conti nents. What he said was, tbat no part of their surface ot that date (in tbe year 1823), was open to tbe colonization of European powers by tbe right of discovery and settle ment, as formerly applied to waste and un occupied territory. To which "doctrine" of public law, as being due to the existing con dition of tbe New World, be added a caveat against the alleged designs of tbe Holy Alli ance, whicb, it was reprtsentdd, after putting don rebellion at borne, proposed to extend iu political system to the American Conti nents, for tbe purpose of suppressing all free institutions beie as well as in Europe. The right of European powers to wage war with Ameiican States, or to acquire their teiritory by purchase or conquest, was never questioned by Mr. Monroe. Wbolisali Promotions. Sute Librarian Brown informed us on Saturday tbat it was bis opinion tbat President L ncola woald remove Mr. Secretary of War Citweron and substitute in hia place-Governor M or too, Indiana.. In that event, R.

[Abstract by Telegraph.] NEW 

YORK, Monday, December 9. The Secretary of the Treasury's report, after referring to the recommendations contained in his July report, gives the manner in which he ob'alned loans for various purposes of Govern ment. The immediate exigencies were pro vided for by Issuing $4,019,034 in 0 per cent, two-years Treasury-notes, and $12,677,760 in rams notes payable In sixty days. His next rare was to provide for disbursements for the war. andTie adopted the plan to engage the bank- ilea? Institutions of the three commercial oltiee of the seaboard to advance tne amount nseaea, in j loans for three years 7 8 10 bonds, to be reim bursed from proceeds of similar bonds, sub scribed for by the people, hoping thus to oom bine the capital of the banks and the people with tbe oredit of the Government, se as to give efficiency to administrative action, and competent support to publis credit, and the result has fulfilled tbe hope. He then rehearses the argument entered into between the banks and himself, by which the former agreed to take the loans. The history of the first two loans has been made public. The second loan wasnegotleted with the Dinks on the 10th of November, by which he agreed to issue to them $50,000,000 in 9 per oent bonds at par for the bonds bearing 7 per cent, inter est. This agreement was coupled with no ar rangement tor reimbursement, and entailed no txpense, exeept the prepaying and issuing of tbe bonds. Tbis was also complied with the option to tbe banks, that on or after tha 1st of January ,a fourth advance of $50,009,000 should be made on tbe same terms as first or second, if required. In addition to these loans $21,145,220, np to the 30th of November, were issued in Treasury-notes of $5's $10's and $20'a, payable on demand, and $3,385,105 remained iu the Treat uty. This amount may be regarded as a loan from tbe people. The aggregate realized from loans in various forms is $197,742 .688. The revenue receipts have not fulfilled his expecta tions. He says an act modifying the rites of duties dlfTored from the measure be submitted to Congress. In most of these particulars, es pecially in diminished duties on tea, ooffes and sugar, and exempting goods in warehouse and on shipboard, the difference was disadvanta geous to the revenue, while a potential cause of reduced receipts may be found in the changed circumstances of the country proving unfavor- ab'e to foreign commeroe. These circumstances compel him to reduce his estimates for 1862 from the revenue from $fi7,000,000 to $32,198,602. Tbe estimates from receipts from lands and miscellaneous tfouroes he reduces from $3,000,000 to $2,304, 062. Tbe only other source of revenue is a direct tax authorised by Congress, which, if increased to the limit proposed by tne Secre tary and assumed by States, the further sum of $20,000,000 may be expected. The aggre gate of revenue may be thus estimated at $54,552,060, whlnh iB $25,417,334 less than the estimate of July. Tbe Secretary states the estimates for July were baed on tbe raising of 250,000 vntua teeis, and an increase of tbe Regular Army by 11 regiments, but after that report bad been olosed Congress au'horlied the accep'anoe by tbe President of 6tiU,l)mi men, Besides addi tional companies and outers. Tbis larfe in crease has and must necessarily augment the expenditures far beyond the limit indicated by the original estimates, which will be still fur ther extended by the increase of tbe Nivy, siid additional appropriations are esked for. Of these additional appropriations $47,985,566 wee authorized by acts of last session, and $143,130,927 are now akod for, making an ag- sreea-e, including: $22,787,933 for indefinite appropriations, of $213,904,427. To provide these large sums, retrenchment and refuim are indispensable. Contracts should be subjected to strict supervision, and con tractors rleorous responsibility. All unneces sary offices ihnuld be abolished and salaries and pay materially reduced. While thus reoom mending retrenchment, be fee s himself con S'rained to review suggestions heretofore sub mitted bv him. that property of rebels should be made to pay, in part at least, the cost of rebellion. Property of great value in loyal States is held by proprietors virtually engaged in cuilty attempts to break up the Union, wbioh Is justly mifeittd to the people, which should be suHec'ed to sequestration or confiscation, and the proceeds applied to the satisfaction of claims arising from tne war. Pioperty of rebels in rebel States should be treated in the same mauner. Ruhts to ser- victs nnder State laws must, of necessity, form an exception to any rule of confiscation. Per sons beld by rebels, under such laws, to service as slaves, may. however, be justly liberated from their constraint, and made more valuable in various employment, through voluntary and compensated services, than if confiscated aa sonncs or property. The Secretary says 'ha most sacred duty the American people now requires tne consecra tion of all their energies and resources to tho etablUbment of tbe Union, and sound polioy would seem to suggest no extension of ireiga ttade, but more absr lute reliance on American libor. American skill and American soil. Be recrmmends duties on tea, coffee and su gar, be increat-ed to 2o. per pound on brown, 3d. on clayed, ZOo on green tea, oe on oolite, and tbat no oiber al'eritiom of tariff ba made unless further txperienite shall demonstrate the necessity. He deems it necessary to increase tbe direct tax so as to produce from loyal Sta'es a revenue ot at leat $20,000,000, esti mating such duties on stills, distilled liquors, tobacco, bmk notes, carriages, legacies on paper evidences of debt, and conveyances property and other like property as will pro duce an equal additional sum. The loorease tax will probably produce $10,000,000 more, making an aggregate of $50,000,000. The secretary is aware tbat the sum is large, but seeing no probability of revenue exoeeding 4tt,UUU,U(iu during tne current year, be t-eta that be must not tbrink trotn a plain state ment of actual necessities of the situation. Two fifths of one per cent, on real and personal property of lojal states will produce $44,d0. POO, tbe proposed Income adding $10,000,000 7 be becretary recommends a plan for a Na ticnal circu ia ion of notes, the features of which are a creulBtn of notes bearing a common Impirsslon, at d authenticated by oomtuoa au tbority. Tbe redemption of these notes aeeocianons andinatitutions to which thry may be delivered for issue and the security of that redemption by pledge of United States Stocks aid an adrquate provision of specie. An important advantage to the peon'e this plan wou'd be in tbe iacreastd security tbe Union, springing from common interests its preservation, created by the distribution i s stocks to asroeiaiions throughout the coun try as lbs basis of their circulation; anl tntntains the opinion if a rredit circulation desirable, it is most desirable to tbis torm. s ates it is earnestly booed, not without sutfi cient grounds, tbat tbe present war be brought to an auFpleious termination before midsum mer, and that in that event the provision revttue by taxation leoomaiended, mil mpi suffice for all financial nigenoies without a l ats, ard enable the Government once to begin a reduotion of the existing debt.
