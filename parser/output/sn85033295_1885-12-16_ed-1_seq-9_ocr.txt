TRIBUTE TO MB. HENDRICKS. To the Congress of the United States: Y o’T assembly is clouded by a sense of public bereavement caused by the recent and sudden death of Thomas A. H< ndricks, Vice President of the United States. His distinguished public services, his complete integrity and devotion to every duty, and his personal virtues, will find honorable room'd in his country’s history. Ample and repeated proofs of the esteem and confi dence in which he was held by his fellow-coun trymen were manifested by his election to of fices of the most important trust and highest dignity, and, at length, full of years and honors, he has been laid at rest amidst general sorrow and benediction. 

CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY. The Constitution, which requires those chosen to legislate for the people to annually meet in the discharge of their solemn trust, also re quires the President to give to Congress infor mation of the state of the Union and recom mend to its consideration such measures as he shall deem necessary and expedient. At the threshold of a compliance with these constitu tional directions, it is well for us to bear in mind that our usefulness to the people’s interests will be promoted by a constant appreciation of the scope and character of,our respective duties as they relate to Federal legislation. While the Executive may recommend such measures as he shall deem expedient, the responsibility for legislative action must and should rest upon those selected by the people to make their laws. Contemplation of the grave and responsible functions assigned to the.executive branches of the Government under the Constitution will dis close the partition of power between our re spective departments, and their necessary inde pendence, and also the need for the exercise of all the power entrusted to each, in that spirit of comity and co-operution which is essential to the proper fulfillment of the patriotic obliga tions wnich rest upon us as faithful servants of the people. The jealous watchfulness of our constituencies, great and small, supplements their suffrage; and. therefore, in the tribunal they establish every public servant should be judged. 

FOREIGN RELATIONS. It is gratifying to announce that the relations of the United States with all foreign powers continue to be friendly. Our position, after nearly a century of successful constitutional government, maintenance of good faith in all of our engagements, the avoidauce of complica tions with other nations, and consistent and amicable attitude toward the strong and weak alike, furnish proof of a political disposition which renders professions of good-will unneces sary. There are no questions of difficulty pend ing with any foreign Government. THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT has revived the long dormant question of the Falkland Islands, by claiming from the United States indemnity for their loss, attributed to the action of the commander of the sloop-of-war Lexington in breaking up a piratical colony on those islands in 1831, ana their subs oquent occu pation by Great Britain. In view of the ample justification for the act of the Lexington, and derelict condition of the islands before and after their alleged occupation by Argentine colonists, this Government considers the claim as wholly groundless. AUSTRIA-HUNGARY. The question has arisen with the Government of Austria-Hungary touching the representation of the United States at Vienna. Having under my constitutional prerogative appointed an es timable citizen of unimpeached probity and competence as Minister to that court, the Gov ernment of Austria-Hungary invited this Gov ernment to the cognizance of certain exceptions, based upon allegations against the personal acceptibility of Mr. Keiley, the appointed envoy, asking that in view thereof the appointment should be withdrawn. The reasons advanced were such as could not be acquiesced in without violation of my oath of office end the precepts 3f the Constitution, since they necessarily involve a limitation in favor of a foreign Government upon the right of selec tion by the Executive, and require such an ap plication of a religious test as a qualification for office under the United States as would have resulted in the practical disfranchisement of a large class of our citizens and the abandonment of a vital principle of our Government. The Austro-Hungarian Government finally decided not to receive Mr. Keiley as the Envoy of the United States, and that gentleman since re signed his commission, leaving the pcs': vacant. I have made no new nominations, and the inter ests of tills Governin' nt at Vienna are nowin the c _re of the Secretary of Legation, acting as charge d’affaires ad interim. GUATEMALA. Early in March last war broke out in Central America, caused by the attempt of Guatemala to consolidate the several States into a single government. In these contests betv eon our nt ighboriug States the United States forebore to int. rfore actively, but lent the aid of their friendly offices in deprecation of war and to pro mote peace and concord among the belligerents, and Ly trach council contributed importantly to the restoration of tranquillity in that locality. UNITED STATES OP COLOMBIA. Emergencies growing out of civil war in the United States of Colombia demanded of the Government at the beginning of the adminis tration of the employment of an armed force to fiulfill its guarantees, under the thirty-fifth article of thfi treaty of 1846, in order to keep the transit open across the Isthmus of Panama. Desirous of exercising only the powers express ly reserved to us by the treaty, and mindful of tlbe rights of Colombia, the forces sent to the Isthmus were instructed to confine their action to “positively and efficaciously” preventing the transit, aud its accessories from being “inter rupted or embarrassed.” The execution of this delicate and responsi ble task necessarily involved police control where the local authority was temporarily pow erless, but always in aid of the sovereignity of Colombia. The”prompt and successful fulfill ment of its duty by this Government was highly appreciated by the Government of Colombia, and has been followed by the express,"on of its satisfaction. High praise is due to tho officers and men engaged in this service. The restora tion of peace on the Isthmus by the re-establish mi nt of ti e constitutional Government there, being thus accomplished the forces of the Unit ed S.ates were withdrawn. Pending these occurrences, a question of much inporlance was presented by decrees of the I olombian Government proclaiming the closi re of certain ports then in the hands of insurgents, end declaring vessels held by the revolutionists to be piratical and liable to cap ture by any Power. To neither of these propo sitions could the United States assent. An ef fective closure of ports, not in the possession of the Government, but held by the hos tiles partisans, could not be recognized. 2seither could the vessels of the insurgents against the legitimate sovereignty bo deemed jiosUs huno'ui generis, w" mu the precepts of in ternational law. Whatever might be the defini tion and penalty of their acts under tho muni cipal law of the State against whose authority they were in revolt, the denial by this Govem- ment of the Colombian proposition did not, how- ' ever, imply the admission of a belligerent status on the part of the insurgents. The Colombian Government has expressed its willingness to negotiate a convention for the adjustment, by arbitration, of the claims of foreign citizens arising out of the destruction of the city of xVs pinwall by the insurrectionary forces. THE ISTHMUS CANAL. The interest of the United States in a prac ticable transit for ships across the strip of land separating the Atlantic from the Pacific has been repeatedly manifested during the last half century. My immediate predecessors caused to be negotiated with Nicaragua a treaty for the construction, by and at the sole cost of the United States, of a canal 1 ■Trough Nicaraguan territory, and laid before the Senate. Pending the action of that body thereon, I withdrew the treaty for re-examination. Attentive considera tion of its provisions leads me to withhold it from resubmission to the Senate. Maintaining as I do the policy of the Presi dents from Washington’s day, which proscribe enlarging entangling alliances with foreign states, I do not favor a policy of acquisition of new and distant territory, or the incorporation of remote interests with our own. The laws of progress are vital and organic, and we must be conscious of that irresistible tide of commercial expansion which, r.s the concomitant of onr active civilization, day by day, is being urged on ward by those increasing facilities of production, transportation, and communication to which steam and electricity have given birth. But our duty in the present instructs us to address ourselves mainly to the development of the vast resources of the great area com mitted to our charge, and to the cultivation of the arts of peace within our borders, though jealously alert in preventing the American Hemisphere from being involved in the politi cal problems and complications of distant gov ernments. Therefore 1 am unable to recom mend propositions involving paramount privi leges of ownership or rights outside of our own territory, when coupled with absolute and un limited engagements to defend territorial in tegrity of the state where such interests lie. 

SHIP RAILWAY. While the general project of connecting the two oceans by means of a canal is to be encour aged, I am of opinion that any scheme to that end. to be considered with favor, shall be free from the features alluded to. Tho Tehuantepec route is declared by engineers of the highest re pute and by competent scientists to afford an entirely practical transit for vessels and car goes by means of a ship railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The obvious advantages of such a route, if feasible, over others more remote from the axial lines of traffic between Europe and the Pacific, and particularly be tween the valley of tho Mississippi and tho western coast of North and Sf * th America, are deserving of consideration. Whatever highway may be constructed across the barrier dividing the two greatest maritime areas of the world, must be for tho world’s ben efit—a trust for mankind, to be removed from the chance of domination by any single power, ncr become a point of invitation of hostilities or a prize for warlike ambition. An engagement combining the construction, ownership, and oper ation of such a work by this Government, with an offensive and defensive alliance for its protection with the foreign states whose responsibilities and rights we would share, is, in my judgment, inconsistent with such dedication to universal and neutral use, and would, moreover, entail measures for its realization beyond this scope of our national policy or present means. The lapse of years has abundantly confirmed the wisdom and foresight of those earlier ad ministrations, which, long before the conditions of maritime intercourse were changed and en larged by the progress of tho age, proclaimed the vital need of inter-oceanic traffic across tho commercial isthmus and consecrated it in ad vance to the common use of mankind by their positive declaration and through the formal obligation of trade. Toward such realization the efforts of my administration will be applied, ever bearing in mind tho principles on which it must rest, and which were declared in no un certain tones by Mr. Cass, who, while Secretary of State in 18. IS, announced that “what the United States want in Central America, next to the happiness of the people, is the security and neutrality of the inter-oceanic routes which may be laid through it. ” 

TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAYS The construction of three transcontinental lines of railway, all in successful operation, wholly within our territory, and uniting tho Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans, has been accompanied by results of a most interesting and impressive nature, and has created new conditions, not in the routes of commerce only, but in political geography, which powerfully affect our relations toward, and necessarily increase our interests in, any transishthmian route which may be opened and employed for the ends of peace and traffic, or in other contingencies, for uses inim ical to both. Transportation is a factor in the cost of com modities scarcely second to that of their produc tion. and weighs as heavily upon tho consumer. Our existence already has proven the great im portance of having the competition between land carriage and water carriage fully devel oped. each acting as a protection to the public against the tendencies of monopoly, which is in herent in the consolidation of wealth and power in the hands of vast corporations. These sug gestions may serve to emphasize what I have already said on the score of the necessity of a neutralization of any inter-oceanic transit, and this can only be accomplished by making the uses of the route open to all nations and sub ject to the ambitions and warlike necessities of none. The drawings and report of a recent survey of the Nicaragua Canal route, made by Chief En gineer Menocal, will be communicated for your information. CHILI, PERU AND BOLIritA. The claims of citizens of the United States for losses by reason of the late military operations of Chili in Pern and Bolivia} are the subject of negotiation for a Claims Convention with Chili, providing for their submission to arbitration. CHINA AND THE CHINESE QUESTION. The harmony of our relations with China is fully sustained in the application of the acts lately passed to execute the treaty of 1880, re strictive of the immigration of Chinese laborers into the United States. Individual cases of hard ship have occurred beyond the power of the Ex ecutive to remedy, and calling for judicial de termination. The condition of the Chinese question in the Western States and Territories 3s, despite this restrict ve legislation, far from being satisfac tory. The recent outbreak in Wyoming Terri tory, where numbers of unoffending Chinamen, undisputably within the protection of the trea ties and the law, were murdered by a mob, and the still more recent threatened outbreak of the same character in Washington Territory, are still fresh in the minds of all, and there is ap prehension lest the bitterness of feeling against the Mongolian race on the Pacific slope may find vent to similar lawless demonstration. All the power of this Government should be ex erted to maintain the amplest good faith toward China in the treatment of these men and the in flexible sternness of the law in bringing the wrong-doers to justice should be insisted upon. Every effort has been made by this Government to prevent these violent outbreaks and to aid the representatives of China in their investigation of these outrages, and it is but just to say that they are traceable to the lawlessness of men not citi zens of the United States engaged in competi tion with Chinese laborers. Kace prejudice is the chief factor in originat ing these disturbances, and it exists in a large part of our domain, jeopardizing our peace and the good relationship we try to maintain with China. The admitted rights of a Government to prevent the influx of elements hostile to its internal peace and security may not be ques tioned, even where there is no treaty stipula tion on the subject. That the exclusion of Chinese labor is demanded in other countries where like conditions prevail, is strongly evidenced in the Dominion of Canada, where Chinese immigration is now regulated by laws more exclusive than our own. If existing laws are inadequate to compass the end in view, I shall be prepared to give earnest consideration to any further remedial measures within the treaty limits which the wisdom of Congress may devise. THE CONGO STATE. The independent state of the Congo has been organized as a government under the sov ereignty of his Majesty the King of the Belgians, who assumes its chi°f magistracy in his per sonal character only, without making the new state a dependency on Belgium. It is for tunate that a benighted region, owing all it has of quickening civilization to the beneficence of the philanthropic spirit of this monarch, should have the advantages and security of his benevo lent super l , i don. The action taken by this Government last year in being the first to recognize the flag of tho In ternational Association of the Congo has been followed by formal recognition of the now nationality which succeeds to its sovereign pow ers. A conference of delegates of the principal commercial nations was held at Berlin last win ter to discuss methods whereby the Congo be sin might be kept open to the world’s trade. Dele gates attended on behalf of the United States on the understanding that its part should be merely deliberative, or without imparting to the result any binding character, so far as the United State were concerned. Tiiis reserve was due to the indisposition of this Government to share in any disposal by the International Congress of jurisdictional questions in remote foreign territories. The results of the conference were embodied in a formal act of the nature of an International Convention, which laid down certain obligations purporting to be binding on the signatories, subject to ratification within one year. Not withstanding the reservation under which the delegates of the United States attended, their signatures were attached to the general act in the same manner as those of the plenipotentiaries of other governments, PRESIDENT’S MESSAGE—SUPPLEMENT. thus making the United States appear, without reserve or qualification, as signatories to a joint international engagement imposing on the sign ers the conservation of the territorial integrity of distant regions, where we have no established interests or control. This government does not, however, regard its reservation of liberty of action in the premises as at all impaired, and holding that an engagement to those in the obli gation of enforcing neutrality in the remote val ley of the Congo would be an alliance whose responsibilities we are not in a position to assume, I abstain from asking the sanc tion of the Senate to that general net. The correspondence will be laid before you, end the instructive and interesting report of the agent sent by this government to the Congo country, and his recommendations for the estab lishment of commercial agencies on the African coast, are also submitted for your consideration. THE 

COMMERCIAL COMMISSION. The commission appointed by my predecessor last winter to visit the Central and South Amer ican countries and report on the methods of en larging the commercial relations of the United States therewith, has submitted reports which will he laid before you. COREA. No opportunity has been omitted to testif y the friendliness of this government toward Corea, whoso entrance into the family of treaty pow ers the United States were the first to recognize. AMERICAN OFFICERS IN COREA. I regard with favor the application made by the Coroan Government to bo allowed to employ American officers as military instructors, to which the assent of Congress becomes necessa ry, and I am happy to say this request has the concurrent sanction of China and Japan. THE SANTOS CASE. The arrest and imprisonment of Julio R. San tos, a citizen of the United States, by the author ities of Ecuador, gave rise to a contention with that Government, in which his right to be re leased or to have a speedy and impartial trial on announced charges, ami witli all guarantees of defense stipulated by treaty, was insisted upon by United States. After an elaborate correspondence and repeated and earnest representations on our part, Mr. Santos was, after an alleged trial and convic tion, eventually included in a general decree of amnesty and pardon by the Ecuadorian execu tive and released, declaring the question of his American citizenship denied by the Ecuadorian Government, hut insisted upon by our own. FRENCH CLAIMS PAID. The amount adjudged by the late French and American Claims Commission to be due from the United States to the French claimants on account of injuries suffered by them during the war of secession having been appropriated by the last Congress, has been duly paid to the French Government. AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST THE FRENCH. The act of Fob. 2.5, 1885, provided for a pre liminary search of the records of the French Tri/jC Court for the evidence hearing on the claims of Amo: i -an citizens against Franco for spoliations committed prior to 1801, The duty has been performed, and the report of the agent will be laid before you. AMERICAN PORK ABROAD. I regret to say that the restrictions upon the importation of our pork into France continue, not withstanding the abundant demonstrations of safety from danger in its use; but I entertain strong hopes that, with a hotter understanding of the matter, this vexatious prohibition will he re moved. It would be pleasing to be able to say as much with regard to Germany, Austria and other countries where such food products arc ab solutely excluded without present prospect of reasonable change. THE 

GERMAN GOVERNMENT AND NATUALIZED AMERICANS. The interpretation of our existing treaties of naturalization by Germany during the past year has attracted attention by reason of an apparent tendency on the paid of the Imperial Govern ment to extend the scope of the residential re strictions to which returning naturalized citizens of German origin are asserted to be liable under the laws of the empire/ The temperate and just attitude taken by this Government with re gard to these questions, will doubtless lead to a satisfactory understanding. THE CAROLINE ISLANDS DISPUTE. The dispute of Germany and Spain relative to the domination of the Caroline Islands has at tracted the attention of this Government, by reason of extensive interests of American citi zens having grown up in those ports during the last thirty-nine years, and because the question of ownership involves jurisdiction of matters affecting the status of our citizens under civil and criminal law. Whilst standing wholly aloof from the proprietary issues raised between powers to both of which the United States are friendly, this Government expects that nothing in the present contention shall unfavorably af fect our citizens carrying on a peaceful com merce on their domicile, and has so informed the Governments of Spain and Germany. 

GREAT BRITAIN. The marked good will between the United States and Great Britain has been maintained during the past year. THE BRITISH-AM ERIC AN FISHERIES. The termination of the fishing clauses of the Treaty of Washington, in pursuance of the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, must have resulted in the abrupt cessation on the Ist of July of this year, in the midst of their ventures, of the oper ations of citizens of the United States engaged in fishing in Britisb-American waters, but for a diplomatic understanding reached with her Majesty’s Government in Juno last, whereby assurance was obtained that no interruption of those operations should take place during the current fishing season. in the intei-est of good neighborhood and the commercial intercourse of adjacent communi ties. A COMMISSION RECOMMENDED. The question of the Nortli American fisheries is one of much importance. Following out the intimation given by me when the extensive ar rangements above described were negotiated, I recommend that Congress provide for the ap pointment of a commission, in which the Gov ernments of the United States and Great Britain shall be respectively represented, charged with the consideration and settlement upon a just, equitable, and honorable basis of the entire question of the fishing rights of the two Gov ernments and their respective citizens on the coast of the United States and British North America. The fishing interests being intimately related to other general questions dependent upon con tiguity and intercourse, consideration thereof in all their equities might also properly come within the purview of such commission, and the fullest latitude of expression on both sides should be permitted. The corresp ndence in relation to the fishing rights will be submitted. THE ALERT. The Arctic exploring steamer Alert, which was generously given by Her Majesty’s Govern ment to aid in the relief of the Greely expedi tion, was, after the successful attainment of that humane purpose, returned to Great Britain in pursuance of the authority conferred by the act of March 3, 188:1. EXTRADITION WITH GREAT BRITAIN. The inadequacy of the existing engagements for extradition between the United States and Great Britain has been long apparent. The fourth article of the treaty of 1842, one of the earliest compacts in this regard entered into by us, stipulated for surrender in respect of a limited number of offenses. Other crimes, no less inimical to the social welfare, should’ bo embraced, and the procedure of extradition brought in harmony with present international practices. Negotiations with Her Majesty’s Government for an enlarged treaty of extradition have been pending since 1870, and I entertain strong hopes that a satisfactory result may be soon attained. THE B iUNDARIES OP 

ALASKA. The frontier line between Alaska and British Columbia, which was defined by the treaty of cessation with Russia, follows the demarkation assigned in a prior treaty between Great Britain and Russia. Modem exploration discloses that this ancient boundary is impracticable as a geo graphical fact. In the unsettled condition of that region the question has lacked importance, but the discovery of mineral wealth in the territory the line is supposed to traverse ad monishes that the time has come when an accu rate knowledge of the boundary is needed to avoid jurisdictional complications. I recommend, therefore, that provision bo made for a preliminary reconnoissance by officers of the United States to the end of acquiring more precise information on the subject. I have invited the Russian Government to con sider with us the adoption of a more convenient lino to be established by meridian observations or by known geographical features without the necessity of an expensive survey of the whole. AMICABLE RELATIONS WITH HAYTI. The late insurrectionary movements iii Hayti having been quelled, tho Government of that republic has made prompt provision for adjudi cating the losses suffered by foreigners because of hostilities there, and the claims of certain citizens of the United States will be in this manner determined. The long pending claims of two citizens of the United S fates, Pelletier and Lazara, have been disposed of by arbitration, and an award, in favor of each claimant, has been made, which by the terms of the engagement is final. ’ It re mains for Congress to provide for the payment of the svixmlat. and amount of the expenses. A question arose with Hayti during the past yt ar, by reason of the exceptional treatment of an American citizen, Mr. Van Bokkelen, a resident of Port Au Prince, who on suit by creditors residing in the Uuiteo States was sentenced to imprisonment, and under the operation of Haytian statutes was denied the relief secured to a native Haytian. This Gov ernment asserted his treaty right to equal treat ment with natives of Hayti in all Suits at law. Our contention was denied by tho Haytian Gov ernment, which, however, while still professing to maintain the ground taken against Mr. Van Bokkelen’s right, terminates the controversy by setting him at liberty without explanation 

CHOLERA AND EPIDEMIC DISEASES. An International Conference to consider the means of arresting the spread of cholera and other epidemic diseases, was held at Rome in May last, and adjourned to meet again on fur ther notice. An expert delegate in behalf of tho United States litis attended, and will submit a report. FRATERNAL RELATIONS WITH MEXICO. Onr relations with Mexico continue to be most cordial as befits those of neighbors between whom tho strongest tics of friendship and inti macy exist as the natural and growing consequence of tho similarity of onr institutions and geographical propinquity The relocation of the boundary line between the United States and Mexico eastward of the Rio Grande, under the convention of July 29, 1882, has been unavoidably delayed, but I see no diffi culty in securing a prolongation of the period fru its accomplishment. The lately concluded com mercial treaty with Mexico still awaits the stipule,ted legislation to carry its provisions into effect, for which one year’s additional time has been secured by a supplementary article signed in February last, and since ratified on both sides. As this convention, so important to the com mercial welfare of the two adjoining countries, has been constitutionally confirmed by the treaty-making branch, I express tho hope that legislation to make it effective may not bo long delayed. The large influx of capital and enter prise to Mexico from tho United States contin ues to aid in tho development of the resources and in augmenting the material well-being of our sister Republic. Lines of railway, penetrat ing to the heart and capital of tho country, are bringing tho two people into mutually beneficial intercourse, and enlarged facilities of tran sit .add to profitable commerce, create new markets, and furnish avenues to otherwise isolated communities. I have already adverted to the suggested con struction of a ship railway across tho narrow formation of tho Territory of Mexico at Tehu antepec. THE PERUVIAN WAR CLAIMS. With the gradual recovery of Peru from tho effects of her late disastrous conflict with Chili, and with the restoration of civil authority in that distracted country, it is hoped that tho pending war claims of our citizens w’l ho adjusted. In conformity with tho notification given by tho Government of Peru, the existing treaties of commerce and extradition between tho United States and that country will terminate March 31, 1880. RUSSIA AND THE JEANNETTE. Oar good relationship with Russia continues. An officer of tho navy, detailed for the purpose, is now on his way to Siberia, hearing the testi monials voted by Congress to those who gener ously succored the survivors of tho unfortunate Jeannette expedition. CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH SPAIN. It is gratifying to advert to tho cordiality of onr intercourse with Spain. Tho long-pending claim of tho owners of the ship Masonic, for loss suffered through tho admitted dereliction of tho Spanish authorities in the Phillippine Islands, has boon adjusted by arbitration and an indemnity awarded. Tho principle of arbitration in such eases, to which tho United States have long and consis tently adhered, thus receives a fresh and grati fying confirmation. Other questions with Spain have been disposed of or are under diplomatic consideration with a vi wto a just and honor able settlement. Tho operation of tho commer cial agreement with Spain of Jan. 2 and Feb. 13, 1884, has been found inadequate to the commer cial needs of tho United States and the Spanish Antilles, and tho terms of tho agreement nro subjected to conflicting interpretations in those islands. Negotiations have been instituted at Madrid for a full treaty, not open to these objections, and in the line of the general policy tracing tho neighborly intorc urse of proximate communi ties to which I olsewTiere advert, and aiming moreover at tho removal of existing burdens and annoying restricts.) jh ; and, although a sat isfactory termination is promised, I am com pelled to delay its announcement'. INTERNATIONAL COPYRIGHT. An International Copyright Convention was held at Berne in September, on the invitation of the Swiss Government. The Envoy of the United States attended as a delegate, but re frained from committing the Government to tho results even by signing tho recommendatory protocol adopted. The interesting and important subject of International Copyright has been be fore you for several years. Action is desirable to effect the object in vie w', and while there may he a question as to tho relative advantage of treating it by legislation or specific treatment, tho matured views of the Berne conference can not fail to aid your consideration of the subject. COMPLI ’ATIONS WITH TURKEY. The termination of tho commercial treaty of 18G2 between the United States and Turkey has been sought that government. While there is question as to tho sufficiency of the notice of termination given, yet as the commercial rights of our citizens in Turkey come under “the favored nation guarantees” of the prior treaty of 1830, and us equal treatment is admitted by the Porte, no inconvenience can result from the assent of this Government to the revision of the Ottoman tariffs, in which tho treaty powers have been invited to join. Questions concerning our citizens in Turkey may be affected by the Porte’s non-aquiescence in the right of expatriation and by the imposi tion of religions tests as a condition of residence in which this Government cannot concur. AMERICAN CITIZENS MUST BE RESPECTED. The United States must hold, in their inter course with every power, that the status of their citizens is to bo respected and equal privileges accorded to them w ithout regard to creed, and affected by no considerations save those grow ing out of domiciliary return to the land of their original allegiance or of unfulfilled personal obli gations which may survive under municipal laws after such voluntary return. THE VENEZUELAN AWARDS. The negotiation with Venezuela relative to the rehearing of the awards of the Mixed Com mission, constituted under the treaty of 1866, was resumed in view of the recent acquiescence of the Venezuelan Envoy in the principal point advanced by this Government, that the effects of the old treaty could only be sot aside by the operation of anew convention. A result in sub stantial accord with tho advisory suggestions contained in the joint resolution of March 3, 1883, has been agreed upon, and will shortly be submitted to the Senate for ratification. UNITED STATES TRUST FUNDS. Under section 3659 of the Revised Statutes, all funds held in trust by the United States, and the annual interest accruing thereon, when not oth ei-wise required by treaty, are to bo invested in stocks of the United States, bearing a rate of interest not less than 5 per centum per annum. There being now no procurable stocks paying so high a rate of interest, the letter of the statute is at present inapplicable, hut its spirit is sub served by continuing to make investments of this nature in current stocks bearing tho highest interest now paid. The statute, however, makes no provision for the disposal of such accretions. It being con trary to the general rule of this Government to allow interest on claims, I recommend the repeal of the provision in question. 

CITIZENSHIP AND NATURALIZATION. The inadequacy of existing legislation touch ing citizenship and naturalization demands your consideration. While recognizing the right of expatriation, no statutory provision exists pro viding means for renouncing citizenship by an American citizen, native-born or naturalized, nor for terminating and vacating Improved ac quisition of citizenship. Even a fraudulent de cree of naturalization cannot now bo canceled. The privilege and franchise of American citi zenship should be granted with care and ex tended to those only who intend in good faith to assume its duties and responsibilities when at taining its privileges. It should be withheld from those who merely go through tho forms of naturalization with intent of escaping duties with their original allegiance, without taking upon themselves those of the now status, or who may acquire tho rights of American citizen ship for no other than a hostile purpose toward their original government. These evils have had many flagrant illucdrations. I regard with favor tho suggestion put forth by one of my predecessors, that provision may be made for a central bureau of record of * the decrees of naturalization granted by the various courts throughout tho United States, now in vested with that power. Thu rights which spring from domicile in the United States, especially when coupled with a declaration of intention to become a citizen, are worthy 7 of definition by statute. The stranger coming hither with intent to r emain, establish-, ing his residence in our midst, contributing to tho general welfare, and by his voluntary act declaring his purpose to assume the responsibil ity of citizenship, thereby gains an inchoate status which login ation may properl v define. The laws of certain States and Territories ad mit a domiciled alien to the local franchise conferring on him the rights of citizenship to a degree which places him in the anomalous position of being a citizen of a State and yet not of the United States within tho purview of Federal and international laws. It is important within the scope of national legislation to de fine this right of alien domicile us distinguished from Federal naturalization. OUR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS. The commercial relations of tiie United States with their immediate neighbors and with impor tant areas of traffic near our shores, suggest es pecially liberal intercourse between them and us. Following tho treaty of 1883 with Mexico, which rested on the basis of reciprocal exemp tion from custom duties, other similar treaties were iuitatod by my predecessor. Recognizing the need of less obstructed traffic with Cuba and Port Rico, and met by the desire of Spain to succor languishing interest in the Antilles, steps were taken to attain those ends by a treaty of commerce. A similar treaty was afterward signed by the Dominican Republic. Subsequently overtures were made by her Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment for a like mutual extension of commercial intercourse with the British West Indian and South American dependencies, but without re sult. SPAIN AND SAN DOMINGO. On taking office I withdrew for re-examina tion the treaties signed with Spain and Santo Domingo, then pending before the Senate. The result has been to satisfy mo of the inexped iency of ent ring into engagements of this character not covering the entire traffic. These treaties contemplated the surrender by the United States of large revenues for inade quate considerations. Upon sugar alone duties were surrendered to an amount far exceeding all the advantages offered in exchange. Even were it intended to relieve our consumers, it was evident that so long as the exemption hut partially covered onr importation, such relief would be illusory. To relinquish a revenue so essential seemed highly iinjirovident at a time when now and large drains npen the treasury were contemplated. Moreover, embarrassing questions would have arisen under the favored nation clauses of treaties with other nations. Asa further objection, it is evident that tariff regulation by treaty diminishes that independ ent control over its own revenues which is "essential for the safety and welfare of any Government. An emergency calling for an in crease of taxation may at any time arise, and no engagement with a foreign power should exist to hamper the action of the Government. TUNNAGE DUES. By the fourteenth section of the shipping act, approved Juno ‘2O, 1881, certain reductions and contingent exemptions from tunnage dues were made as to vessels entering ports of tho United States from any foreign port in North and Central America. The West India Islands, tho Bahamas and Ber mudas, Mexico and the Isthmus as far as Aopin wall and Panama ; the Governments of Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Portugal and Sweden and Norway, have asserted under the favored-nation clause in their treaties with the United States, a claim to like treatment in respect to vessels coining to the United States from their homo ports. This Government, however, holds that tho privilege grunted by tho act is jmrely geo graphical, inuring to any vessel of any foreign power that may choose to engage in traffic between this country and any port within the defined zone, and no warrant exists under tho most-favored nation clause for tho extension of tho privileges in question to vessels sailing to this country from ports outside the limitation of the act. Undoubtedly tho relations of com merce with our near neighbors, whose terri tories form so long a frontier line difficult to be guarded, and who find in our country and equally offer to ns natural markets, demand special and considerate treatment. It rests with Congress to consider what legislative action may increase facilities of intercourse which contiguity makes natural and desirable. DIPLOMATIC AND CONSULAR SERVICE. I earnestly urge that Congress recast the ap propriation for tho maintenance of tho diplo matic and consular service on a footing com mensurate with the importance of our national interests. At every post where a representative i., necessary, the salary should be so graded as to permit him to live with comfort. With the assignment of adequate salaries, the so-called notarial extra-official fees, which our ( ffijers abroad are now permitted to treat as personal perquisites, should he done away with. Every act requiring the certification and seal of tho officer should he taxable at schedule rates, and the feo therefor returned to tho treasury. By restoring these revenues to the public use tho Consular service would bo self-supporting, even with a liberal increase of the present low salaries. In further prevention of abuses a system of consular inspection should bo in stituted. The appointment of a limited number of secretaries of legation at large, to be assigned to duty wherever necessary, and in particular for temporary service at missions which for many causes may bo without a head, should also be authorized. I favor also authorization for the detail of offi cers of the regular service, as military or naval attaches at legations. Home foreign Governments do not recognize the union of consular with diplomatic functions. Italy and Venezuela will only .receive tno ap pointee in one of his two capacities, but this does not prevent the requirement of a bond and submission to the responsibilities of an office whose duties he cannot discharge. Tho super added title of Consul General should be aban doned. 

EXTRA TERRITORIAL COURTS. I deem it expedient that a well-devised meas ure for the reorganization of the extra territorial courts in Oriental countries should replace the present system, which labors under the disad vantage of combining judicial and executive functions in the same office. LEGATION PREMISES. In several Oriental countries generous offers have been made of premises for housing the legations of the United States. A grant of land for that purpose was made some years since by Japan, and has been referred to in the annual messages of my predecessor. The Siamese Government has made a gift to the United States of commodious quarters in Bangkok. In Corea the latr Minister was permitted to purchase a building from the Government for legation use. In China the premises rented for the legation are favored as to local charges. At Tangier the house occupied by our repre sentative has been for many years the prop erty of this Government, having been given for that purpose in 1822 by the Sultan of Morocco. I approve the suggestion heretofore made, that in view of the condition of life and the administration in the Kastem countries, the legation buildings in China, Japan, Corea, Siam, and perhaps Persia, should be owned and furnished by the Government, with a view to permanency and security. To this end I recommend that authority be given to accept the gift j adverted to in Japan and Siam, and to purchase in the other countries named, with provision for furniture and repairs. A considerable saving in rentals would result. THE NEW 

ORLEANS EXPOSITION. The World’s Industrial Exposition, held at New Orleans last winter with the assistance of the Federal Government, attracted a large num ber of foreign exports, and proved of great value in spreading among the great concourse of vis itors from Mexico and Central and South Amer ica a wider knowledge of the various manu factures and productions of this country, and their availability in exchange for the products of those regions' TARIFF ON WORKS OF ART. Past Congresses have had under consideration the advisability of abolishing the discrimination made by the tariff laws in favor of the works of American artists. The odium of the policy which subjects to a high rate of duty the paint ings of foreign artists, and exempts the produc tions of American artists residing abroad, and who receive gratuitously advantages and in struction, is visited njion our citizens engaged in art culture in Europe, and has caused them, with practical unanimity, to favor the abolition of such an ungracious distinction, and in their interest and lor other obvious reasons, I strongly recommend it. THE GOVERNMENT FINANCES. The report of the Sacretary of the Treasury fully exhibits the condition of the public finan ces, and of the seyeral branches of the Govern ment connected with his department. The sug gestions of the Secretary relating to practical operations of this important department, and his recommendations in direction of simplifica tion and economy, particularly in the work of collecting customs duties, are especially urged upon the attention of Congress. LAST YEAR’S REVENUE. The ordinary receipts from all sources for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1885, were §322,690,- 700.38. Of this sum §181,474,930.31 was received from customs and §115,498,725.54 from internal revenue. The total receipts as given above were §24,829,103.54 less than those for the year ending June 30, This dimunition embraces a fall ing off of §13.595,550.42 in the receipts from cus toms and §9,087,846.97 in the receipts from inter nal revenue. EXPENDITURES. The total ordinary expenditures of the Gov ernment for the fiscal year were §260,220,935.50, leaving a surplus in the'treasurv at the close of the year of §63,463,771,27. This is §40,929,854.32 less than the surplus reported at the close of the previous year. The expenditures are classi fied as follows: For civil expenses, §23.826,942.11; for foreign intercourse, §5,439,909.11; for Indians. §6,552,494.63; for pensions, §56,102,267.49; for the military, in cluding river and harbor improvements' and arsenals, §42,670,578.47; for the navy, including vessels, machinery, and improvements of navy yards, §16,021,079.69; for interest on the public debt, §51,386,256.47; for the District of Columbia, §3,499,650.95; for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light-houses, and collecting the revenue, §54,728,054.21. REDUCTION OP DEBT. The amount paid on the public debt during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1835, was §45,993,- 245.43, and there has been paid since that date and up to Nov. 1, 1835, the sum of §366,828, leav ing the amount of tho debt at the last named date §1,514,475,860.47. There was, however, at that time in the Treasury applicable to the gener al nurposes of the Government the sum of §66,- 818,292.33. THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES FOR TEE CURRENT YEAR. The total receipts for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1886, ascertained to October 1, 1335, and estimated for the remainder of the year, are §315,000,000. The expenditures, ascertained and estimated for the same time, are §245,000,000, leaving a sur plus at the close of tho year estimated at §70,000,000. VALUE OF EXT OUTS. The value of exports from the United States to foreign countries during the last fiscal year was as follows: Domestic merchandise §726,682,946 Foreign merchandise 15,5 6,809 Gold 8,477.892 Silver 33,753,633 T0ta1.... §784,421,280 Some of the principal exports, with their va!-< ues and the percentage they respectively bead to the total exportation, are given as follows : Per j ~ , Value. centage.'< Cotton and cotton manu factures £213,793,049 29.43, Manufactures 150,370,820 22 07’ Breadstulls—provisions 107,332.456 14 77 Oils—mineral, vegetable. and animal 54,326,202 7 43 Tobacco and its manufact ures 24,767,305 3.41' Wood and its manufactures 21,404,322 2.95 our.

The fact that our revenues ore in excess of the actual needs of an economical administra tion of the Government justifies a reduction in the amount expected from the people for its sup port. Our Government is but the means estab lished by the will of a free people by which cer tain principles are applied which they have adopted for their benefit and protection. ' And it is never better administered and its truer spirit is never better observed than when the people’s taxation for its support is scrupulously limited to the actual necessity of expenditures and dis tributed according to a just and equitable plan. I The proposition with which we have to deal is.' the reduction of the revenue received by th® Government and indirectly paid by the people from customs duties. The question of free trade is not Involved nor is there now any occasion for the general discus sion of the wisdom or expediency of a protec tive system. Justice and fairness dictate that in any modification of the present laws relating to revenue, the industries and interest which, have been encouraged by such laws, and in. which our citizens havt largo investments.should not be ruthlessly injured or destroyed. Wo should deal with the subject in such man ner as to protect the interests of American labor, winch is the capital of our workingman. Its stability and proper remuneration furnish the most justifiable pretext for a protective policy. 'A ithin these limitations a certain reduction should be made in our customs revenue. The amount of such reduction having been deter mined, the inquiry follows • Where can it best be remitted, and what articles can best be re leased from duty in the interest of our citizens? I think the reduction should be made in tho revenue derived from a tax upon the imported necessaries of life. We thus directly lessen tho cost of living in every family of the land, and release to the public in every humble home a larger measure of the rewards of frugal indastr THE 

NATIONAL, BANK CIRCULATION. During the year ended Nov. 1, 1885, 145 nation al banks were organized, with an aggregate cap ital of $10,938,000, and circulating notes have been issued to them amounting to $4,274,910. The whole number of these ba-nks in existence on tho day above mentioned was 2,727. The very limited amount of circulating notes issued by our national banks compared with the amount the law permits them to issue, upon a deposit of bonds for their redemption, indicates that tho volume of our circulating medium may bo largely increased through this instrumental ity. THE SILVER QUESTION. Since February, 1878, the Government has, un der the compfllsory provisions of law, purchased silver bullion and coined the same at the rate of more than 2,000,000 of dollars everv month. By this process up to the present date. 215,759,431 silver dollars have been coined. A reasonable appreciation of a delegation of power to the General Government would limit its exercise, without express restrictive words, to the people’s needs and the requirements of the public welfare. Upon this theory the authority “to coin money” given Congress by the Constitution, if it permits the purchase by the Government of bullion for coinage in any event, does not justify such pur chase and coinage to an extent beyond tho amount needed for sufficient circulating medium. The desire to utilize the silver pro duct of the country should not lead to a misuse or the perversion of this power. The necessity for such an addition to the sil ver currency of the nation as is compelled by the silver coinage act is negatived by the fact + hat up to the present time only about fifty millions of silver dollars so coined have act ually found their way into circulation, leaving more than one hundred and sixty-five millions in possession of the Government, the custody of which has entaiUl a considerable expense for construction of vaults for its deposit. Against this latter amount there are outstanding silver certificates amounting to about 93,000,000 of dol lars. Every mouth $2,000,000 of gold in the public i Treasury are paid out for £2,030,000 or more of silver dollars, to be added to the idle mass al-‘ ready accumulated. If continued long enough' this operation will result in the substitution ofi silver for all the gold the Government owns ap-l plicable to its general purposes. It will not do to rely upon the receipts of the Government to make good this drain of gold, because the silver thus coined, having been made legal tendtr for all debts and dues, public and private at times during the past six months fifty per cent, of the receipts for duties have been in silver or silver certificates, while the average within that period has been twenty ner cent. The proportion of silver and its certificates received by the Government will probably increase a®' time goes on, for the reason that the nearer the! period approaches when it will be obliged to offer silver in payment of its obligations, the greater inducement there will be to hoard gold against dejireciation in the value of silver, or for tho purpose of speculation. This hoarding of gold has already begun. When the time cornea that gold has been withdrawn from circulation, then will be apparent the difference between tho real value of the silver dollar and a dollar ja gold, and the two coins will part company. Gold, still the standard of value and neces sary in our dealings with other countries, will be at a premium over silver. Banks which have substituted gold for the deposits of their cus tomers may pay them with silver bought with such gold, thus making a handsome profit. Rich, speculators will sell their hoarded gold to their neighbors who need it to liquidate their foreign debts at a ruinous premium over silver, and the laboring men and women of the land, most de fenseless of all, will find that the dollar received for the wages of their toil has sadly shrunk in its purchasing power. It may be said that the latter result will be but temporary, and that ultimately tne price of la bor will lie adjusted to the change, but even if this takes place tho wage-worker cannot possi bly gain, but must inevitably lose, since the price he is compelled fo pay for his living will not only be measured in coin heavily depreci ated, and fluctuating, and uncertain in its value, but this uncertainty in the value of the purchasing medium will be made the pretext for an advance in prices beyond that justified by actual depreciation. The words uttered in 1834, by Daniel Webster, in the Senate of the United States, are true to day : “The very man of all others who has the deepest interest in a sound currency, and who suffers most by mischievous legislation in money matters, is the man who earns his daily bread by his daily toil.” Tho most distinguished advocate of bimetalism, dis cussing our silver coinage, has lately written: “No American citizen’s hand has yet felt the sensation of cheapness, either in re ceiving or expending, the silver-act dollars,” and those who live by labor or legitimate trade never will feel that sensation of cheapness. However plenty silver dollars may become, they will not be distributed as gifts among the peo ple, and if the laboring man should receive f jvx silver dollars where he now receives but two, he Avill pay in the depreciated coin more than double the price he now pavs for all the necessaries and comforts' of life. Those who do not fear any disastrous con sequences arising from the continued compul sory coinage of silver as now directed by law, and who suppose that the addition to the ci r rency of the country, intended as its result v'U boa public benefit, are reminded that history demonstrates that the point is easily reached in tho attempt to float at the same time two sorts of money of different excellence, when the bet ter will cease to be in circulation. The hoard ing of gold which has already taken place indicates that we shall not escape the usual experience in such cases. So, if this silver coinage be continued, we may reasonably expect that gold and its equivalent will abandon tho field of circulation to silver alone. This, of course, must produce a severe contraction of our circulating medium instead of adding to it. It will not be disputed that any attempt cm tho part of the Government to cause the circulation of silver dollars worth 80 cents side by side with gold dollars worth 100 cents, even with the limit that legislation does not run contrary to laws of trade, to be successful must be seconded bv the confidence of the people that both coins will re tain the same pure basing power and bo inter changeable at will. Special effort has been made bv the Secretary of the Treasury to increase the amount of out
