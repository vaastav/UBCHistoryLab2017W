MAY PROD IT ... -y^ 5v--V-: Menage Counted on to Put Some Life Into the Session—Some of the Dere lict* of Recent Storm Anxious Noth ing Should Be Done—Lobbyists Are Hopeful. i. {John Callan O'Laughlin in Chicago Tribune.] Wtashington, D. C., Dec. 3.—It is a battered congress which will meet at noon today at the capltol. (Many of its members have suffered shipwreck and are drifting aimlessly on the sea of politics In search of a haven which has an official salary. •Derelicts like Piatt and Depew float With the tide, awaiting the certain fate of retirement from public life. Others who weathered the storm of the recent elections look with wearied eye upon the three months of the coming session. There is no united purpose to do more than absolutely necessary, nothing like the energetic determina tion which marked the assemblage a year ago and which resulted in the passage of the railroad rate, meat in spection, pure food, and other laws. There are no high hopes save among the lobbyists. The session like the last of those of past congresses will be as lifeless as the leaders in the senate and house can make it. But weary as .congress is It will have to reckoij with the man at the white houHe. His message, which will be transmitted on Tuesday, will give thi senators and representatives game solid material for legislative digestion. The Income and inheritance tax proposition easily will take first place in public es timation. The relations of capital and labor, national licensing of corporations doing an interstate business, and the relief of labor thru a more stringent eight hour law on all government work, the limitation of the hours oi' labor of railroad employes, and the anii-injunc-, tion question will be second. The currency legislation, tariff legis lation in behalf of the Philippines, a ship subsidy and immigration will be among the other important matters the president will call to the attention of the legislative branch of the govern ment. These are by no means all the recom mendations the president will, make in his message, but they are the ones which will appeal to congress in all probability above anything elsse he may say. Japan, Cuba, and Secretary Root'* South American trip and the presi dent's views on the negro problem will be interesting, but will not call for any^ special action. Rather will what he says regarding Japan tend to discour age any agitation of the Japanese ex clusion question. Tho It is generally recognized that the annexation of Cuba is a certain consequence of American intervention in the island, there is no likelihood of any change thru congressional action of the relations which this government maintains toward the queen of the Antilles. Secretary Root's visit to South Arfa« erica will point the way to the presi dent's recommendation for a ship sub sidy bill and it may be stated author itatively that the president's views on this subject have been strengthened by what the secretary of state told him about the condition of the American' merchant marine in southern waters. As to the negro question, it is like ly some fclnd bf an investigation will be made by one of the two houses, not of a race aspect, but of the action 'of the president in dismissing 200 soldiers of the Twenty-fifth Infantry. It is un derstood that Senator Foraker' of Ohio Intends to introduce a resolution on the subject if no one else has the temerity to do eo. The senator is not concern ed so much about the race feature as about the« degradation of veteran sol diers without trial. Such a resolution of inquiry probably will be adopted and the senate committee on military affairs play be charged to look into the mat ter. The message 6f the president will not be all the work the executive has cut out for the legislators. As to congress, there will be the us ual'grist of bills turned Into the legis lative mill, with little chance of any getting thru. It is too shore a session for acnon on any measures save those imperatively demanded by the people, and in the past even these sometimes have failed. Besides the appropriation bills which must be passed, congress will dispose of the following measures: Appropriations for the Improvement rivers and harbors. Restricting immigration. Defining the extent of the application of writs of injunction in labor dis putes. •Granting tariff reductions to the Phil-' ippines. Providing for the establishment of a.i elastic currency. Investigation of the child labor and women employment questions. Appropriations for the enforcement tOf the pure food law. Granting a subsidy in behalf of the merchant marine. 

FORGED CHECK TO JOIN LOVER. Des Moines Girl Smitten With Soldier Boy Under Arrest Des Moines, Dec. 1.—To obtain the funds which would enable her-to join her lover, a soldier In the Eleventh cavalry, no\^ in Cuba, pretty 19-year old Grace McCord, it is alleged, forged the name of John McCord, her father, a wealthy farmer near Bayard, to a check for $400. She collected the mon ey, purchased tickets for herself and two friends from Des Moines to New Orleans, and was arrested at New Or leans just as she was embarking on a Southern Pacific steamer for Havana. Local detectives left for that city to return with the you'ng girl to the un relenting father. The two young women whoin Miss McCord so philanthropically aided are Mrs. Abie Rice and Mrs. Hannah Smith, both of whom married soldiers flft the Eleventh and were anxious to v-A. it,• join their husbands.. -. Miss McCord is engaged to marry John Kuhn, a cavalryman in Troop She had anticipated marrying him up on her arrival in Cuba. The story of Miss MeCord's alleged waywardness Is romantic to suy the least. She learned to love her soldier sweetheart passionately and was brok en hearted when he was sent to Cuba. Last Tuesday morning Miss McCord went from her father's home to Guthrie Center and there presented herself be fore the superintendent of schools with a check for J400 upon the bank at that place. The check was properly signed by John McCord, who has a 600 acre farm in Guthrie county and plenty of ready cash. The cashier of the bank looked over the check, recognized the signature and accepted the endorse ment of the man who Identified the girl. Several hours later Mr. McCord was in Guthrie Center. He denied having issued the chock and insisted that the bank run down the girl. T-h« Iowa National bank of Des Moines was communicated with and the case placed in charge of Detectives Me Nutt and Ed Johnston, who learned that Miss McCord with two other young women had been booked to New Orleans via Kansas City. The chief of police at New Orleans was notified and he captured the party last even ing just as they were about to etn •bark for Cuba. It is claimed that Miss McCord money bought tickets for all the girls, tho this has not been proved beyond yond a* doubt as yet. The girls worn very indignant at the arrest last even ing and Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Smith in sisted that they had done nothing wrong and could not be arrested. In connection with the investigation of the Miss McCord escapade the po lice learned ihat on the same day of her departure eleven Des Moines young women and girls left this city for Ha vana to rejoin either soldier husbands or lovers. The* went by various routes, some by Newport News, some by Pitts burg and some by New Orleans. It Is thought, however, that Miss McCord did not contribute to the expenses of any of these save the three in her par ticular party. ASSASSIN IS ARRESTED.
