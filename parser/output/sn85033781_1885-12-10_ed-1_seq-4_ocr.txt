TRUE NORTHERNER. Published Every Thursday. FAW PAW, MICHIGAN, DECEMBKU 10 The tboublk has began Again. Congress ftisenibled last Monday. Aix talk about rich men and "boodle candidates for governor of Michigan, is the sheerest kind of nonsense. As long as our etato maintains its penurious system of pay ing its governor a salary of only a thousand dollars per year, no poor man need apply. No one but a wealthy man can afford to ac cept the office. Geneiul Kohkciuks has written a labored article on the "Mistakes of Grant," which was published in the Xorth American lie viae. "Old Ilosy" has a good many friends among the old soldiers and among the people in general, but he will find it a hard matter to prove that he is a biger man than old Grant," or that he knows more about the late war than did the deceased general. Not onit has the present domocratio ad ministration not paid a single dollar of the public debt during all the time it has been in power, but during the month of Novem ber, according to the statement of the secre tary of the treasury, there was an actual in crease of nearly five millions of dollars. The party in power was never noted for its suc cessful management of the finances of the government, and the result of the first nine months of President Cleveland's administra tion is pretty fair evidence that the party has not improved much with age. When, in 18C1, the democrats surrendered control of the government to the republican party, tho Na tion was practicdly bankrupt. In this respect, the indications are that, if sufficient time be allowed, history will repeat itself. Wiixiam II. Vanderbilt, the groat railroad magnate, dropped dead at his residence in New York, on Tuesday last at 2:30 p. m.The cause of his death is supposed to have been paralysis. lie loaves a family of j fosr eons and four daughters, all the latter all married, and who will, probably, inherit his great wealth which is estimated at $200, 000,000. On the death of his father, the Commodore, William II. inherited $100,000, 000, to which, by economy and frugality he had added 100 per cent, besides enjoying a tolerably good living. He was sixty-four years of ago at the time he was called to part with his competency of this world's goods. His death creates considerable excitement in financial circles but it is yet too early to judge what will be the result. Ketublican senators made a wise choice when they selected Hon. John Sherman of Ohio, as the presiding oflloer of the senate and acting vice-president of the United States. Mr. Sherman is one the ablest and foremost statesmen of our country, and will, no doubt, fill tho office of vice-president with credit to himself and honor to the people. Had ho desired it, wo would rather have seen John A. Logan elected to the office, than any other man, but for good reasons ho declined the honor which his republican associates ten dered him. And he was probably correct in his judgment, as thero is no doubt that he can bo of greater service to tho country cn the floor of the senate than m its presiding officer, and tho work will be far more cot genial to him than would be his duties as president of the senate. Gekexcackkiw used to complain bitterly that tho republican party did not pay the public debt as fast as it ought. To remedy thi3 state of affairs they assisted, as best they could, in putting tho democratic party into power. That party has run the government nine months, and has not paid a singlo dollar of the bonded debt. On tho contrary, it has begun to report a monthly increase, instead of decrease. It has withdrawn nearly a hundred millions of dollars from the circulating me dium of tho country, and piled it np in the United States treasury where it does no good to anybody, and which, as far as any present practical uso is concerned, might as well have been destroyed. How much havo we gained by our alliance with the democracy? is a question that honest, intelligent, practical men of the geeenback faith, are now asking of themselves. Tub South Haven Sentinel and the Paw Paw Courier should bo ablo to find enough to do in minding their own business. That immense jobbing and advertising patronage, of which the Courier boasts sojrauch, must surely bo all one democratic editor ought to attend to, in addition to the dischargo of the lalor incident to his position as editor of the organ of the party of his recent choice. However, bo that as it may, the Nortitehnkb n not yet ready to perform tho grand trans formation act and will not go over to the democracy a i did the Courier man, nor-yet half way over as did tho Sentinel man. It has no aspiration nor intontioa af belonging to tho party of Cleveland and Yaple. Uy tho way, what has become of Yaplo anyhow? It is currently reported that he has lost his grip, and that a Kalamazoo man, and an old lino democrat at that, is the power behind the throne, and the dispenser of patronage for .tho 4th congressional district. We ruBLisn in another column, a commu nication from our esteemed friend Join Kcowles Esq., of Durango, Colorado, on the silver question. Wo will say right bore, that we did not intend, in the previous article mentioning his name, to intimate that his views on this matter were induced by selfish motives, or that he was not perfectly honest in the opinions he entertained. Mr. Knowles has displayed his well known ability and ingenuity in compiling and arranging statis tics to support his argument and theory, and has written sonn things with which we are in full aooord. The Nobtiieunib, as we have repeatedly stated, does not believe in a gold itaalard alone, but is an advocate of a double stands rd both gold and silveronly it wants tho silver dollar to be as valuable, intrinsica'ly, as a gold dollar, and it desires tho coinage of silver dollars, containing 100 cents worth of silver, to bo placed upon tho Barco basis as the coinage of gold free and untrammeled. We do not believe, however, that tha demonetization of the silver dollar in 1873, was at all responsible for tho decline in tho price of that metal. During the en tire sixty years preceding such demonetiza tion, this government had ooinod but $8,045, 833 silver dollars, while since the passage of tho Bland bill, in February, 1878, less than eight years ago, it has coined over $200,000, 000 twenty-five times as many as during all the previous years and yet silver has not appreciated in value, but, on the contrary, has steadily declinod. When the weight of the silver dollar was fiied at 4 12 grains, it wa.i equal in value to a gold dollar, but in 1873 it had appreciated, or gold had depreci ated, if that way of putting it is preferred, until silver dollars were worth about 103 cents and no longer circulated as currency, to any great extent, but were bought and sold as merchandise. The great argument of the advocates of the "buzzard dollar" was that its coinage would raise tho price of sil ver to its former standard, but the argument has been proven, by the logio of events, to be a fallacious ono, and now, in all fairness, if they demand free coinage, they ought to be willing to have the weight of the dollar increased bo that it shall be what it purports to be, a dollar in fact as well as in name. It has often been remarked that thero was no more effective method of politically killing a publio man, than to elect him to tho vice presi Jtncy. Not one man in a hundred can correctly namo tho different men who have occupied that office. The recent death of Vice-President Hendricks has brought this mattor prominently into notice, and the fact that most men who havo heretofore filled that office havo sunk into oblivion and are nnremembered and their very names almost forgotten, is emphasizod by tho conflicting statements made in the public press concern ing the number of vice-presidents who have died in office. Tho number has been various ly stated by leading and influential newspa pers at from two to five. The latter number is the correct one. The first vice-president who died before the expiration of his term of office was George Clinton, who died in 1812, the last year of his second term. The second was Elbridge Gerry, whose namo is perpetuated in the word gerrymander, the political term for notoriously unfair division of a state into congressional or representative districts. Mr. Gerry was elected in 1812 and died in 1814. The third was William llufus King who was elected in 1852 and who died during the first year of his term of office. The fourth was Henry Wilson who was elec ted in 1872 and died in 1875, and fifth and last, Thomas A. Hendricks, over whose sud den and unexpected death the people aro now mourning. Twenty-ono different indi viduals have been elected to this, tho second office in the gift of the people. Four of the number. John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, An drew Johnson and Chester A. Arthur, suc ceeded to tho presidency, by reason of a vacancy in that office. Tho mortality in the vice-presidential office has been somewhat greater than in tho office of chief magistrate, notwithstanding tho fact that two of our pre sidents met their death at tho hands of an assassin. Twenty-two different men have filled the ofllco of president, of whom Win. H. Harrison, Zachary Taylor. Abrhaara Lincoln and James A. Garfield died before tho expiration of their terms. Of all the men who have been honored with an election to either of tho two principal offices iu our gov. ernmont but five are now living: Rutherford B. Hayes, Chester A. Arthur, G rover Clove land, Hannibal Hamlin and William A. Wheoler. The President's Message. President Cleveland's mo3sago is tho long est ever laid before the National legislature, and may be looked upon as a successful at tempt of "how not to say it." Owing to its extreme length, it will be read by only a com paratively small number of people. He re views at length the relationship between the United States and foreign countries and finds it to be, as a general thing, quite satisfactory. With reference to the tariff question, he thinks our rovenuo is excessive, greater than the necessities of the government demand, and rocommsnds a reduction of duties on the necessaries of life. He carefully avoids any thing looking toward free-trade, and remarks thit such ro Juctions should bo made ho as not to injuro or destroy American industries, and so as to avoid injury to American labor. la view, however, of tho fact of tho increaso of tho estimates for governmental expendi tures and of the increase of tho public debt, it is difficult to understand why tho reveuuo should bo reduced. Tho present democratic administration, if it can be correctly judged by tho record of tho past nine months, may bo trusted to safely get away with all the revenue that will come into tho public treas ury, without any reduction of duties. He thinks tho ceaseless flow of "buzzard dollars' from the mint, at the rate of $2,000,000 a month depreciated as they are will prove disastrous to tho best interests of tho people, and in this opinion ho is, doubtless, correct. Ho deprecates tho fact that tho United States has no navy, not even a single war veasel that could keep tho seas against a first class vessel of any important power, and says that such a condition of things ought not to con tinue. A very largo portion of the message ia devoted to tho Indian question. He thinks tho truo solution of that question is to bo found in the educatiou of tho red man. Many of hU western constituents will disa gree with this plan. They think tho Indian is already too highly educated, especially in the art of war, and in the practice of murder and rapine, and that as there aro not, and aro not likely to be, any good Indiana but dead onos, tho sooner they are exterminated tho better it will be for civilization and for the country. He favors the holding of the publio lands for actual settlers, and condemns wholesale land-grabbing. Ou the Mormon question, ho takes a decided stand, and re commends that a statuto be enacted forbidding the immigration of Mormon converts. His views on this question should receive tho hearty support of the people, re gardless of all party predilections or partisan considerations. On tho question of civil service reform ho presents a well written essay showing the beauties of the theory of reform in the civil service, from read ing which & person might reasonably supposo that we had at last struck the pana cea that would effect n permanent cure for all governmental ills. But when Mr. Cleveland's theory on this important question, is con trasted with Mr. Cleveland's practice, the matter assumes somewhat of a ludicrous aspect. As a theoretical reformer Mr. Cleve land is a grand success, but as a practical re former, he may be bafely trusted to renovate tho civil service by turning out all republi cans on tho hypocritical pretense that they aro "offensive partisans" and filling their places with partisan democrats. The result of this method of reforming the civil service must of course be vastly more beneficial (?) to tho country than it would bo to tako the more manly and honorablo position and say "republican officials must go been use they are republicans, and their places must bo filled by democrats because they aro democrats. On tho whole, tho message, while it contains some good recommendations it could not well be otherwise in a document of such ex trenio length will not take rank among the really great and important state papera of tho Nat'.on.
