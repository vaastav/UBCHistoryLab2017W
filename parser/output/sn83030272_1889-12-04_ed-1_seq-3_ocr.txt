Th attention pi tha Inter-btate Commarea Oommliwion has been called to tba urgent need if Congressional legislation for the batter pro tJetlon of the lives and limbs of those engaged IToperatlng tbe great inter-BUte f night lines 3 the country, and espoelallv of the yard. SiVn and brakoraen. A petition, slgnod by Marly 10.000 railway brnkemen, was presented m the Commies ion. asking Uint stopa might be Sien to brlnir about tho uso of outoruntio Erikes nnd couplers on freight cars. At a meeting of Htnte llallroad Commission ers and their accredited representatives, held, tftashlngton In March last, upon tba lavlta Son of thelnter-Htate Commerce Commission, irosolution was unanimously adopted urging the Commission " to consider what ctm bo dono S prevent the loss of Itfo and limb .In .coupling andnncounllng freight cars, and in handling the brnkos of such cars." During the year dlng June 3d. 1889. ovor 2.000 railroad em. Sieves were killed in bervlco. ami rnore than K injured. It is competent, I think, for . congress to require uniformity In tbo con atroctlon of cnrs tisod in Inter-8tato commerce, and the uso of improved .safety appliances BDon Biioh trains. Tlmo will bo neoessaryto make tbo needed ohnngoB. but an oarnost and lHtelllcent bfCitinlng should be made at once. It iso ronrwica to our civilization Uint any riasi of American workmen should, in tho pur suit of a ncossnry and usotul vocation, bo ubleotod to n peril of life and limb na great as that of a soldlor In timoof war. Tho creation of an Executive Department, to be known na tho Departmantof Agriculture, Si the net of Feb. 0, lost, was a wlso ntflt timely rasnonse to a reonost which bad lone boen ro ipcittullyurgod by the farm ore of tbo country. Hut much remains to bo dono to perfaot tho orcanl7atlon of tho Department so, that It may fairly re-tllzo tho expectations which its crea tion excltort. In this connection attention is filled to lbs suggestions contalnod in tho ro iortof tbo Heerotnry. which is herewith sub milled. The need of nlaw ofllccr for tha Do rVartmont. such as is provided for the other (J-'iecutHo Departments, la manifest. Tho fall ore ot the last Congress to make the usual pro Tblon for tho publication ol tho annual report should bo promptly remedied. . Tho publlo In terest In the report nnd its vnluo to tho farm ing community I nm turo will not bo dimin ished under tbo now organization ot tho Do- 'recommend that the 'Weather Forvlce ba aopara'ed irom tha War Department nnd ostob llslio I as a lluroiui In tbo Department of Agri culture. This will involve an ontlro reorgani zation both of tho Weathor Bureau and of the fcienni Coriis, making ol tho Drat n purely civil organization nud of tha other a purely military smlT corps. Tho report of the Chief blcn.il Ofllcer shows that tbe work ot tho corps on its military sklo has tven deteriorating. , The interests of tho people ot tbe District ot Columbia should not be lost sight ot in tho tresture for consideration of measures affect dc tbo whole country. Having no legislature of Its own. either municipal or general. Its poo rlo mut look to Congress for the regulation ot all theeo concerns that. In tho States, are tbo Subject of local control Our whole poople ave an interest that the National Capital should be made attractive and beautiful, and above all that its repute for social ordershould be veil maintained. Tho laws regulating the sals ot Intoxicating drinks in the District should be revised with a view to bringing the traffic nnder stringent limitations ana control. In execution of the power conferred upon me by tho act making appropriations for the ex penses of the District of Columbia for the year ending June SO. 1880, 1 did. on Aug. 17 last ap point lludolph Horing of New York, Samuel lit Grny of llhodo Island. ondFrodorlckP. Stearns of Massachusetts, three eminent sanitary en gineers, to examlno and report upon the evs tern of sewernge existing in the District of Co lumbia. Their report, whloh Is not yet com pleted, will bo in due course submitted to Con gress. Tbo report ot the Commissioners ot the Dis trict is herewith transmitted, and the attention ot Congress Is oalled to tho suggestions con tained thoreln. The proposition to observe the 400th ' anniversary ot the discovery ot Amer- lea by tho opening of a worlds fair or exposition In some ono ot our great cities will 1 be presented for the consideration of Congress. Tbo value and Interest of such on exposition may well claim the promotion ot tho General Government On March 4 last the Civil Service Commis sion hod bnt a single member. The vacancies were filled on May 7. and since then the Com missioners have been industriously, though with an lnadeauato force, engaged in executing the law. They ware assured by me that a cor dial support would be given them in tho faith ful aud Impartial enforcement of tho statute, and of the rules and regulations adopted in aid MIL Heretofore the book of ellgibles has boen closed 'to everyone, except as certifications were made upon tbo requisition of tbe appointing- otilcera This secrecy was tho source of much suspicion, and of many charges of fa voritism in the administration of tho law. what is eecrof 'B always suspected: what is open an be judged. The Commission, with the full approval of all its members, has now oponod the list of ellgibles to the public. The ellgtblo lists for the classified post offices and custom houses ore now publicly posted in the respective offices, as are also the certllllcatlons for appointments. Tiie purpose ot tho CItII bervlco lawwas absolutely tooiolndenny other consideration In connection with appointments under it than that of merit as tested by tho examinations. The business proceeds upon the theory that both tha Examining Boards and tho appointing officers are absolutely ig norant as to tbo political views and associa tions ot all persons on the civil service lists. It is not too much to say. however, that some recent Congressional lntestlgntions have somewhat shaken public conlldonce in tho im partiality of the selections for appointment I Tbo reform of the civil service will make no safe or satisfactory advance until the present law and Uh onual administration are well es tablished In the contldence ot the people. It will be my pleasure, as It is my duty, to toe that tbe law Is executed with firmness and Im partiality. If some ot its provisions have boon fraudulently ovudnd by uppolntlng officers, our retenlinent should not suggojt the repeal ot the law, but reform in its administration. Wo should have ono view ot the matter, and hold it with a sincerity that is not affeotcd by tbe consideration thnt the party to which we be long is for tbe tlmo in power. JJly predecessor, ou tbo 4th day of January. 6t'J. by an Uxocutlve order to take effect lnrch 15, brought tho Hallway Mall Horvlto undortbo operation of the Civil Senlco law. Provision was made that tbe order should tako effect soonor in any State where an eligible list was sooner obtained. On the 11th day of March. Mr. Lyman, then the only member of tbo Commission, roport ol to mo in writing that it would not bo, posiblo to havo tbe list ot ellgibles ready before May 1. and requested that the tn icing effect of the order be postponed until that tlmo, which was done, subject to tho same provision odntalned in tho original ordor a-t to States in which an eligible list n as sooner obiainod.

I recoinmond that tbo nddliionol clwrks naked by tho Commission be appropriated lor. Tho duty of uppolntment lndetolvod by tbo Constitution or by the law, and the appointing olllceru aro properly hold to a high responsi bility in its excrclau.

Dut, on thoother haud.it is not true that lucuni benoyis a conclu!vo argument for u contin uance in office. Impartiality, njodorutlon. fidelity to public duty, and n good attainment in tho discharge of It must be added belorotlie nrgumont is uuinnleto. Wliou thofo holding administrative otllcejt so conduct theinsoles us to convince just riolltlcnl opponents that no party consideration or bias atTocttt in any way tho discbarge of tholr public duties, we can more ousllv stay the demand for removals. I am satlsilad that both in and nut of the classified son Ice Grout benefit would accrue from tho adoption of somo systum by which tho officer would receive the distinction and benollt that in all private employments, comes from oxctiiitlrtml inltlifulnuauund efficiency In In tho performance of duty. Ihnvo suggested lo tho heads of the execu tive departments that thiy consider vt nether n record irflgbt not be kopt in ouch bureau of nil thoi-e elements thnt uro covered by the terms 'faithfulness" und "efficiency." and a rating made showing fhurolatlu mortis of thaclerl:s of each class, this rating lo lo rogurdodusa teH of merit in ranking promotions. ' 1 have also buggealod to thn l'ostmnslor Cenonil that ha mlopt eome plan by which he can, upon tho basis of tlio reports to tbo de partment uud of frequent Inspections, indicate tlie relative merit of rostniastera ol each class. Tl.ey will bo appropriately indicated in tlio official riiL-lBtor and In tho report of tbe depart ment. That u groat stimulus would thus bo. elien to the wliolo eervicu I do not doubt and such a rocoid would be the host defence aetlnst Inconsldornte removals from office. 1 he Interest of the general Government In tho education of tho people lound nn early ex preMion, not only In the thoughtful nndromo times warning utterances of our ablest states men, but In liberal appropriations from the common resources for the support of educa tion in tint new States. No one will deny that it is of the, gravest national oonoern that those Jho hold tha ultimate control of all tiubliunf Jflrs should have tbe necessary Intelligence wlielr to direct nnd determine them. National aid to education hns heretofore taken tbo form or mud grunts, and in that form the constitu tional power of Congress to promote tho edu cation of the people Is not sertonsly ques tioned. I do not think it can be successfully Questioned when the form Is changed to that ota direct grant ot money from tbe publlo vreasurr. ouch aid- should be,-as It always has bean. suggested br some exceptional .conditions. Tha sudden emancipation of tha alaves of the South, the bestowal of the suffrage, which soon followed, and the Impairment ol the ability of the Statee where these new citizens war ohleffr found to adequately provide educa tional facilities, presented not only exceptional but unoiamrled conditions. That tha situa tion has been much ameliorated there la no doubt The ability and interest ot the 8tates have happily lnorensed. lint a grent work remains to be done, and I think the general Government should lend Its aid. As tho suggestion of n national grant In aid of education grows oblefly out ot tbe con dition and needs ot the emancipated slavo and his descendants, tbo relief should, as far ns possible while necessarily proceeding upon some general linos, bo applied' to the need that anggested It , It is essential. It mueh good la to bo accomplished, that tbe sympathy and ac tive Interest ot the people ot tho States should be enlisted, nnd that tbe methods adopted should bo such as to stimulate nnd not to sup plant local taxation for school purposes. As ono Congress can not bind a succeeding onolnsuchacaso, and as tho effort must iu some degree be experimental. I recommend that any appropriation made for thlscurposo bo so limited In annual amount nnd as to the time oer which It Is toextond nswill, on tho ono hand, give tho local school authorities op portunity to mako tho boat ute of tho first year's allowance, and on the othor dollvor thorn from thn tomptntlon to unduly postpone tho assumption o: tbo whole burdon tboni selves. Tho colored people did not Intrude them solvos upon un: thoy woro brought here in chains aud held In tho communities whoro they are now chiefly found, by a cruel slavo code. Happily for both racos thoy are now free. They have, from n standpoint of Ignor ance and poverty, which was our shame, not tholrs. mado romarkAhlo advances in educa tion and in tho acquisition of property. Thoy have, as a people, shown thomsolvos to bo frlondly nnd faithful toward the white raco. under temptations of tremendous strength. Thoyhnvetbrirroprosentatlvesln tho national cemeteries where u grateful Government hat athored tho ashes ot thoso who died In Us efence. Thoy ,hae furnished to our reg ulsr army regiments that havo won high prnlso from their commanding ortlccrs for oourngo and soldierly qusllllos. and for Udellty to the enlistment oath. In civil life they are now the tollers of thoir communities, making tholr full contribution to tho widening streams of prosperity which these communities are re coiling. Tholr nudden withdrawal would stop production and bring dlsordor Into tho house hold as woll as tbo shop. Generally thoy do notdeslroto quit tholr bomos, and thoir em ployers resent tho interference of tho emigra tion agonts who Boek to stimulate such a de sire But. notwithstanding all thU, In many parts of our couutry whore the colored population Is Inrgo the poople of that raco aro, by various dc vlroR. deprived ot anrolTccthooxercUeo! tholr political rights and of many of thoir civil richt. The wrong does not expond ltrolf uponthoo whose vote ore supproseil. Every constitu ency in tho Union is wronged. It has boen tho hope of every patriot that a so nso of justlco and of tespeot for the lnw would work a gradual euro of those llugrnnt eviln. Surely no one supposes that thepresont pan be nccopted as a permanont condition. If It Is said thnt those communities must work out this problem for themselves, wo have a right to ask whether they are at work upon it. Do they, BUggest any BOlutlonV When and under what conditions is tho black man to havo a free ballot? when Is he. In lact iohao thoso full civil rights which have so long been his in law? Whon Is that equnlity ot fnfluoneo whloh our form ot government was Intended to secure to tho electors to be restored ? This generation should courageously faco thoso grave questions, and not leavo them as a heritage of woe to tbo noxt. Tbo consultation should proceed with candor, calmness and great patience: upon tbe lines of justice and humanity, not ot prejudice and cruelty. No question in our country can bo at rest except upon the firm base ot justice and of the law. f .1 earnestly Invoke tbe attention ot Congress to tho consideration of such measures within Its well-defined constitutional powers as will secure to all our pooplo a rreo ciorclse of tho right of suffrage and every otbor civil right under the Constitution nnd laws of the United States. No evil, however deplorable, can justify ihe assumption, either on tho part ot tha jxocutlvo or of Congress, of powers not granted; bnt both will bo highly blninablo If all the powers granted aro not wisely but firmly used to correct theso ovlls. The power to tnke the wholo direction and control ot tho election of membors of tbe House of Representatives is clearly given to the General Government. A partial nnd qualified supervision ot theso elections is now provldod for by law. and In my opinion this law may be so strcugtbened and extended ns to secure, on the wholo. bettor results than can be attained by a law taking all tbe processes of such election Into Federal control. The colored man should be protected In all of his relations to tho Federal Govern ment whether, ns litigant juror or witness In our courts, as an elector for membors of Con gress, or as n peaceful tra eller upon our inter Btato railways. Thore is nothing more jUBtly humiliating to the national pride, and nothing more hurtful to the national prosperity, than tho Inferiority of our merchant mnrlno compared with thatot other nations whoso general resources, wealth, and sea-coast linos do not suggest any reason for their supremacy on tho soa. It vt uh not always so, and our peoplo are agreed, I think, that It shall not continue to bo so. It Is not possible In this communication to discuss the causos of tho decay of our shipping interests or the different methods by which It Is proposed to restore them. The statement ot a few well authenticated facts and some general suggestions as to legislation is nil that Is practicable, 'i hat tho great steam ship lines sailing under tbo tings ot England, franco. Germany, Spain, and Italy, and en gaged in foreign commerce, were promoted, and havo since beon and now nro liberally aided, by grants ot publlo money. In ono form or nnother. is genornlly known. That tbe American lines of steamships have been abandoned by us to an unequnl contest with tbe aided lines of other nations until they havo been withdrawn, or. In tbe fow ensea where thoy are still maintained, aro subject tosorious disadvantages, is matter ot common knowl edge. The present situation Is such that travellers and merchandise find Liverpool o.ten a neces sary intermediate port botweon Now York nnd some ot the South American capitals. The fact that somo ot the delegates from South American fctatos to the Conference of Ameri can Nations, now In tesslon at Washington, reached our shores by reversing that lino of travel, Is vory conclusive of the need of such a conference and very suggestive as to tho first and most necessary stop in tbe direction ot fuller and more beneficial Intercourse with nations that (ire now our neighbors upon tho lines of latitude, but not upon tho Hues of established commercial intercourse. I recommend that such appropriations be mado for ocoan mall service, iu American steamships, between our ports and those of Central and South America. China. Japan, and tbo Important Islands in both of the grent ocenns as will be liberally remunerative forthe service lenderod. and ns will encourage the establishment nnd In somo fair degt oo equalize tbo chances of Aworlcnn bteamshlp lines In tho competitions which they must meet Thnt tho Amorican States lying south of us will cordially co-operate in establishing and main taining such lines of steamships to tholr prin cipal ports I do not doubt Yo should nlso mako provision for a naval reservo to consist of such merchant shins, ot American construction and of n specifiod ton nagoand spood, ns tha owners will consent to plnco nt tho uso of tlio Goyei biri?nt. In . mj of need us nrmod cruisers. England has adopted this pollny, and an a result can now. upon ne cessity, at once plnco upon her naval list some of tho fastest steamships In tho world. A proper supervision of tbo construction of r.uch vessels would mako their conversion Into effective ships of war ory easy. 1 am an advocate oi economy in our national expenditures, but It Is a misuse of terms to make this word describe a policy that with holds an expenditure for the purpose of ex toiiding our foreign commerce. The enlarge ment and Improvement of our merchant mu rine, tlio development of a sufficient body of trained American sonmen. tbo promotion of rapid and regulur moll communication be tween the rorts of other countries nnd our own. ffnd the nrtnotution of largo andswllt American merchant hlenmelilps to ninaluses, In tlmo of war. are publlo pun osiBOf tbe high est concorn. , , .

WABiUKcnoN, Dec. 4. Tho proceedings of tha Senate begun promptly at 13 o'clock. Tha galleries presented a bare appearance oom ' pared with that of tha previous day. Tha backs of the seats could be seen in a number ot places. The publlo gallery contalnod tha most people, whllo tha mombara' gallary had a very sparse population. There ware but four persons In the dlplomatlo section. President Morton entered the chamber with a smiling countenance and stood dovoutly at the desk while the Chaplain prayed. Forty-throe Sena tors stood up during the prayer. Secretary McCook was then calltd on to rond what had boen written about the previous day's session. It soemod to be satisfactory, for none ot the Senators objoctod to It, and the President an nounced that It had been accepted. During the time occupied in reading it the Sonators began to talk too much for President Morton, and a sharp rap of tho gavel brought them to order. Capt. jlassett watched Beoretary MaCook's manuscript Intently. When It became evident that It was about exhausted tbo venerable offi cial ot tho Senate almost skipped to tho rear of thecbambor. Just tho mlnuto McCook fin ished, TJassott, in n voice somewhat broken by age, said: "Mr, President, a message from the liouso ot Itopresentathes." And thon Sena tors Edmunds of Vermont and Harris of Ten nessoo stood side by side while tbe statesman from Vermont told the Senate thatia quorum ot the liouso was present He added the in formation that Thomas B. Reed, a citizen of Maine, had been chosen Speaker, and Edward McPhorson, a citizen ot Pennsylvania, had been elected Clerk. lie concludod by announc ing that the Prostdont of tbe United States de sired to communicate with tbe Sonate Immedi ately. Senator Edmunds has mado this speoch so many tlmos that It rolls out without effort on his part Ho always puts it In exactly the Bnrao words. Cant ilasbott tho. mnstor of ceremonies, beckonod to Exocutlvo Secretary Pruden. He looked Innocently at tho man from tbo White Uoaeo. just as It he did not know what he had, and alter he had bowod gracofully ho concen trated nil his dignity in the words "A Message from the President of tbe United States," Soaring tho huge onvelope in ono hand, he marched down the aisle and gave it to Presi dent Morton. Then President Morton bowod while ho snlaamod. The Executive Secretary made a very jerky sort ot obeisance, which the President returned, and tho message was Anal ly in tho possession ot the Senate. Tho big red soal on the back of the envelopo was broken by tbe President and tbe pamphlet was hand ed to Secretary MoCook. who bogan to read it Senator Beaganot Texas soemed at first to be tho most interested In its contents. Ho loaned nnxionsly forward, put one hand bohtnd his ear. and was Intent on catching every word. He soon relapsed, however, and looked as if he was very drowsy. Senator Vance of North Carolina continued to write lottcrs. Sonntor Hlscock of Now York ran his lingers through bis hair, looked dreamily at the Secretary, and thon turned to his mall. Senator Allison ot Iowa let his eyes wander about the hall, and appeared as It ho was porfectly content with hlmsolf and all tho world. Tho great Quay, the only Senator who wears a gray suit on tho Senato floor, looked as if he know overy word ot it He was so confldont of it that bo retired to n lounge to hold a conference with Congressman Darlington. The boltd and substantial Sonator Sawyer of Wiscon sin stroked his beard and gazed hard at the celling. Tho Itcpubllcun loader. Senator Edmunds of Vormont. sunk down Into his ohalr and began to cur) tho ends of his hnarn around his flncors. Senator Sher man ofJ Ohio folded bis nands in his lap and his Intellectual face nover lighted up bnt once that was when tbo messagu alluded to tbe sliver question. Ho seemod to be much more engrossed In tbe actions of Congressman Seney, who had jusi ontored the room. Tho Congressman is a candidate for Senator, and good judges of political ability say he will bo elected. Senntor Chandler of New Hampshire left his seat and went to tho Clerk's desk, where ho could hear every word, and bo followed Secretary McCook's every act witb his eyes. Senators ost of Mis souri. Voorhees of Indiana, Dock ot Kentucky, and Hoar of Massachusetts had a conlurenca nbout something. They wero deeply engross ed in it nround oorheas's desk, and the major part ot the message was lost to them. When that portion which alludes to tho tariff was rouched several of tho Senators brightened up and attempted to listen. Tbo effort was too much and tbe Isomnolont condition soon obtained. Even tbe President seemed to be ludlfferent, for he toyed with a penknife and gazed dreamily at the big golden Inkstand on is desk. Tho only event which broke tho monotony was tbe appearance of tho pages bearing Moral designs. Tho benators looked dreamily at them, and watched tbe boys as they placod the flowers on the contiguous desks of benators Pettlsrew and Moody. One was mndo to rep resent a fish, on which wero tbo words " Pick are) Statesman." That is tbo political namo for Senator l'ottlgrow in South Dakota. The other was a floral lvre two feet high. Several of tho Senators gathered to look at tbe flowers, and a correspondent in the gallery said some thing about fishermen and llnrn. It was evi dent the remark was not board below for not a Senator smiled. Tbo sceno beoame drowsy again until Senator l'ottlgrow opened the lid ot his doBk. He had not opened it often enouelt to learn how it worked, and as a result the floral pickerel made a dash for the floor. Not a benator relaxed. The new member from Soutn Dakota looked very sad. and after some time railed n page, who caught tbo pickerel and put It back on tho desk where the poople in tbe galleries could seo it He did not Boom to want any thing In his desk alter that . , As soon as Secretary McCook uttored tbe words " Benjamin Harrison," tho last in the message. Senator Sherman was on his feet. He wanted tbo message to lie on tho table, aud he also wanted 10,000 extra copies printed for tho use or the Senate. The rest of tho Sen ators seomed to want tho same thing, and President Morton said It would be dono. benator Hale of Maine thought It was tlmo to adjourn, and so moved. Senator Iliscock of New York desired to introduce a rosnlutlon providing n clerk for his committee on tbo organization, condtilon. and expenditures of the executive departments. Senator Halo wlthdiewhls motion, and Senntor Hlscock wns told tnat his resolution would go to the Commit tee on Contingent Expensos. As no one else appeared to bo nnxlous to say anything. Son ator Hale renewed his motion, and it was coi ned. It took just one hour and thirty minutes to do tbe business. One hour and twenty min utes was consumed In reading tho message. And so closed the second day nt the session In the solemn and somnolent Sonate ot tbe United States. Uomciix J. Vasck. House of Representatives. WAsniHOTON. Deo. a. The Capitol was again thronged to-day. There wero almost as many persons around the entrance of the House as there were yestorday. Tbe Houso was In session two houts and a halt. As the hour of 12 approached tbo doorkeepers found some difficulty In clearing tbo floor ot stran gers. Theybnd hardly accomplished the feat before Speaker Thomas B. Ileod ontered from the lobby and climbed tho stairs loading to his desk. The groat silver mace was placed upon Its pedestal nnd the Amorican Hag floated from the staff above the Houso wing of tho CapltoL Mr. Iteed brought down his gavel with a bang. Iu his broad Maine accent he said: " The nouse will be in order, nud tbo Chaplain will offer prayer." The Jlov. William U, Mllburn sat below blm at the Clerk's dosk. ' He arose, rested his elbow upon the desk, and raised bis sightless eyes to heaven. Tbe most ot the membors arose nlso whllo others re mained in their seats In a devout attitude. The Chaplain made a short prayer, expressing sym pathy for the families of the dead membors of the Filty-Brst Congress. When he closed his petition, be descended from tbe Clork's rostrum and was conducted to tba Speaker's lobby. There his faithful daughter awaited him and accompanied blm. "The Clerk will read tbe minutes," Bpeaker Iteed said. Tbe minutes were read by Cleric Fettlt and approved. Tha Speaker then laid before the House two communications from the Senate, In relation to its organization. Here there was a stir In tbe crowded gal leries. Major MoElnloy of Ohio, the Hon. Jos. O. Gannon of Illinois, and ex-Speaker Carlisle of Kentucky were seen coming down the main aisle arm In arm. They were the committee appointed. vto wait upqa the Prasldtnt and in- r i ".I form him that tba Houso was organized and rtsdy for business. When half way down the alile Major tfoXloley stepped to the front and rostod his hand upon the desk? ot a Itennblloan member.

Tho baby hippopotamus which, on Sunday night, came to gladdon tho hearts of Its mam ma, Fhtlmo, noe Miss Murphy, and Its papa. Caliph, was getting on famously yestorday In the Central Park Zoo. It had been transferred to a bis cage all to ltsolf. and It played like a child in tho straw with which 'the cage was filled. Fatlma absolutely refused to nourish her fat ltttlo child, and in consequence it was forced to tako Its nourishment from a cham pagne bottlo filled with warm milk. Tho baby was named yesterdtiy. As a deli cate tribute to tho memory ot one who has been genornlly lamontod In this cltv lately, it rocolvod the nnmo of Mr. McQlnty. Whon n Bon reporter with a photographing apparatus callod yesterday nftornoon It wns contentedly rubblng its fnt wrinkled side against tho back of its big cage. Tho mother wns lying in n big tank in nnother cage, and nothing but tbo end of ner blunt cose and her eyes was visible above the water. She observed tho photographing reporter's movemouts vory closely, however, and when Bhn saw the camera focussod upon her tender offspring she cnllod out In nlnrm. Then tbo photo grapher snapped bis llngors and whistled, and told jounc Mr. Mclllnty to watch the llttlo hole In tbo camora nnd seo n little bird come out.

Tho proceedings In tho House to-day removed whatever donbt may have existed as to who would be Chair man of the Ways nnd Means Committee In this Congress and leader ot the Republicans. The Chairman qf this committee is by long-established custom a member of the Committee on llules and leader ot the party on tho floor. Judge Kelloy of Pennsylvania was Chairman of the committee in 1883 when tho Tariff act of March 3 was passed, and thinks his long term of sorvlco nnd devotion to the protection policy entitles him to tho honor again. There has boen a gonoral impression, howover, that the old man would be shelved it Deed became SpenLor, and this impression ban now deep ened Into n gonoral conviction that McKlnloy, the Pennsylvnnlan's proteed, will be promoted over tho head of his tutor. So general is this understanding that tho'llenublicnns already recognize McKlnloy as tbe party leader on tho floor, and tbe Ohloan assumes direction as if It were a settled fact, McUlnley has never hero toforo taken a very prominent part In general debate on the floor, nut he has thorough com mand of hlmsolf and tho respect of nls col leagues, so that tbe leadership will fall upon his shoulders easily. The nret iadlcntlon of who would tnke Ileod'a place was given just after tho reading of tho President's message, when McKlnloy arose and moved its reforenco to the Commlttoo of tho Whole. A moment lator Tom iiayno ot Pittsburgh, one of Heed's chief lloutenants In tbe Speakership light, rose with a motion that whon tho House ndjourn It be to moot on Thursday. As ho spoke he turned Irom the Snoakor to McKlnloy to poo It tho mo tion met his approval, and on rocelving a nod proceedod with his romnrk. Tho manner In which llnyno performod this llttlo net ot cour tesy to Mchlnlor. paying no attention to Can non nnd tho othor ox-Speakershlp candldntes, showed mom plainly than words tho part 31c Ktnloy was to play In the j'ifty-flrst Congress. Sir Julian Pauncefote, the Erltlsh Minister, nnd other members of tbo diplomatic coipbuis very indignant at tho shabby treatment which they recclvod nt the Capitol yesterday, and It la uultn likely that there will bo an investigation of tho uflalr. One seotlon of tho Houso gallery Is reigned for tho uho of the foreign visitors, and the pouts in It aro under tho control of the Secretary of Slate. On nearly every ocoaslott of unusual lntorost the members ot the Houso manage to havo this gallory thrown open to tholr families nnd friends, regardless of the rights ol the diplomats. Yesterday the troublo over this mattor was more serious than usual, and tho persons ontitled to the seats, Including Sir Julian and his trlonds, woro rudely de prlrod ot tbe privilege of occupying them. Whon the crowd had becomo so great that every seat in the galleries was filled, tho unfortunato sightseers lookod longingly upon the vacant plnros in tho dlplomatlo gallery. A. number sought tho doorkeeoor, who. either in Sorson or by wrltton ordor. admitted a suf clont number to Mil the gallery. In violation ot propriety, courtesy, aud the rules of tho House, wblch provido that no ono shall be admitted to tho gallory except upon presenting n, card signed by tho Socretary of State. Naturally membors of the Pan-American Congress woro nnxlouB to bo presotit, and to thoso who ap Pllod orders of admission had boen Issued by tho Secretary ot State, and they want to swell the number of chagrined foreign representa tives. A number uf South Americans, one of whom was Dr. Nln ot Uruguay, wont in upon the floor of the Houso. only to oe poremptorlly ordered out. Two Initios wbo wero of the party woro told to stand tholr ground by soma mem ber of Congress, and thoir ory posltlt o rolusnl to budgo secured thoui tho prfvilego of staying. Walker Illaluo apooared upon the sceno soon nftorblr Julian Pnuncefote und his party had gone, and promptly domandod an explanation of tho doorkeeper In chnrgo, by whom ho was referred to the assistant doorkoeper of thn liouso, Ono of the foreign Jllnleters Bald that two yoars ago tbe same thins had oc curred, and that he bad 1 over yet boen able to wituess tho opening of Congress. Mr. Blalnti also sala tho same thing occurred nt tho opon Ing of the Fiftieth Congress. Tberehns never beon nny troublo ovor tho dlplomatlo corps' gallery on tho Senato side, for hero the rules are no strictly observed that evon foreign Min isters thonibelvos must presont a card beating the signature of tho Socretary of Mate before they can train admission to tbe gallory, which lb ulnays kept locked. Tho Republican Senate cauaus called for the transaction ot some routine business this afternoon brought out an interesting proposi tion from Sonator Edmunds, who lnld boforo his colloagues a plan for a great national uni versity at Washington by wnyof celebrating tho lourth centenary ot the discovery of Amer ica. "Tho plan." said the Vermont Senator. "Is not a new one. Oeorge Washington him self was heart and soul for It, aud leftmuner for the establishment ot n university, which should he the great institution of learning in I tho country." I Senntor Edmunds wants a Protestant insti tution, which shnll forestall the efforts of the Catholic. Church to estubllsh a groat university under the shadow of the Capitol. He said Uint he had no objection to the Cathollo Church when it loft tho State alone, but the trouble was that It did not loavo the State alone. Sen ntor Sherman said bo favored the project ot a university, but he wantod It to bo unsectarlan. It wastlocided to reorganise the select com mlttoo on tbe celebration of the discovery of America bv putting on it a Senntor to repre sent each New York. Chicago, and St. Louis. This monns that Senator Iliscock will retain the Chairmanship of tbo commlttoe If bo wants to, and that Sonator Farwell.and probably Sen ator Cockerel, will find places on It. Two or threo new committees on emigration, Indlnn depredations, or some such subjects, will bo mado for tha accommodation ot the new Sona tors and some of the older ones who have not Chairmanships will thus be provided for. No stops wore taken to change tho Senate officers The clorks ot the Committees on Appropria tions of the Senate and liouso have prepared a comparative statement ot estimates, appro priations, and expenditures for tbe mainte nance of the Government for the fiscal years 1800 and lb'Jl, from which it appears that the net increase of tbe estimates for 18'Jl ovor those for the current year is $20,8(7.18H. and that tho net Inrrenso ot tho estimates tor tho noxt year over tha appropriations for this year Is f 

SS.O'J'.', ll'J. The total estimates of regular and per manent annual appropriations for the next Usual year are titW.BiS.yio, while tlio total rovonues nro estimated at $150,414,337. show ing un excess of estimated revenues over estimated appropriations next year of $13, 571.02J. Tho net surplus for tho present year Is placed at $Sj,C32,511. or tii.vtiI.-iB- mote than tho estimated surplus for tho next fiscal year. This Is without rcferenco to tlio possibility ot a river and harbor bill, for lu tho estimates submitted by tbe Seoretarv of th Treasury there is u notablo omission ot tho ordinary provision for river and harbor im provements. The statement diners materially from that prepared by the Treasury Depart ment and exhlbitvd In tho book of cstlmutes just issued, for the reason thnt the poxtnl is celpts und revenues are differently treated liy tbe Troubury and the Appropriation Committees. Said Senator Tarwell this morning: "I have not read the report ot the Civil Service Com mission, but I shall probably have a good time when I do read It. It mny be wearisome, though, for this civil service system Is a fraud of the worst kind, a client, a delusion, a hum bug: lu fact, you cannot tay anything too mean of It." " hen will you Introduce your bill towlpo it out of existence 1" , , "I don't know that I shall Introduce snoha bill." replied the Senator. "We can do just as well by refusing to appropriate tbe funds on which It depends. It wbb beatenthat way be fore, and we nro going to do our best to beat It that viay onco more agalu." Secretory WIndora to-day appointed Special Agonts O. L. Spauldlng, I. M. Montgomery, and W. S. Chance a commission to Investigate tho charges made by Doston merchants against Dr. Edward Shorer, chemist of the sugar laboratory at tne New York Custom nouse, and also to Inquire Into the alleged differences In the practice ut the pons of New York, Phila delphia, and Doston In the examination of im ported sugars. Within a few days den. Cutcheon of Michigan will introduce a bill calling foracousus of those persons wbo served In tbe war of the re bellion. The enrollment will Include separate sheets on which shall be a complete history of each man's service, together with a statement of bis present financial condition. (Jen.

Tbe Pennsylvania colony In Washington have been agitated nil summer by tbe various reports that have reached thorn of tho prelim inary contest between the rival candidates in tholr State for tbe nomination for tho Gover norship. The term ot Oov. Beaver expires in January. 1891, and tbe Republicans expeot to nomlnato his successor next summer. Nearly all tbo delegates to theState Convention will be elected next spring. Tbe fight to secure these delegates has already become very lively. The principal candidates are Slnte Senator Dela- mater, a rich man, and President of a railroad corporation In tbe Northwestern part of the State; Daniel )!.

Ot these candidates the only ones who have any real hope ot success are Senator Deln I mnter and (Jon. Hastings. Major Montooth represents the Influence in Alleghany county of Christopher K Magee, who has deolnred open war upon Senator Juny, State Senator Delaraatorand William II. Andrews. Chairman ot tho Pennsylvania Republican Committee, have Just finished a visit of several days ns the guosle of Senator Uuuy. It is generally sup posed that they have asked him to use his In fluence in behalf of Senntor Delamatar's can didacy. It In understood, however, thnt Quay declines to Inlerfero ns between Delnmnter nnd Hastings, although of course ho would actively exert himself against Mr. Magee's candidate.

Tho National Wool Growors' Association or ganized its convention to-day by electing Columbus Delano of Ohio President nnd O. II.

Chinatown la suddenly left without Its Mayor and Joss without Its prtost. Tho Hon, Chyo Ton Ping, tbo Cblnose Mayor, Chlot Jus tlco ot tho Peace, Mandarin, nnd IIIcli Priest, popularly known as the "Zoon I'nh'Goon Soo Cean Sung." has suddenly and socrotly desortod his post and loft for parts unknown. The Chi neso City Hall nt 1C Mott street Is practically In Egyptian darkness, nnd loft In tho solo enro of its only othor official. " Poh Ye." the old Town Marshal and Chlot of the Polico Doonrtment and Department ot Publlo Works. It was alleged by eomo that Mr. Chyo Von Ping has simply eloped with a beautiful Irish blonde, and that he has taken her to Canada, together with the funds of the "Zoon Fall,, to.," municipality, but upon closer examination of the contents ot the "City Hall" safon couple of ancient cigar boxes and n dilapidated to mntu con exports found that the Chinese Mayor had not joined tbe congregation ot ox Aldermeu, but had been strictly honest In his accounts. The minority of his political opponents think he has only absented himself until tbe present Mott street scandal, ncouslng him ot a bold ut tompt to sell Chinatown to tbo highest bidder, shall blow ovor. 'ihls wns probably the reason whv Mr. Cho secretly packed tin his blnnkots nntl nines nnil dlschnrcred lifmsolf from furthnr duties of the "oon Fall (Joon SooCeanSung's" olllce. It Is probable that he had formally ten dered his resignation as High Prle-t to Joss, as a big bunch of fragrant Joss sticks and nlso tho fresh n'hos of a ptlo of burnt Inceuso papers were fouud upon tho ultar ot the vory gentle manly Cblnose god In the mean time tho affairs of Chinatown wero all topside down, and in despair tbe mer chants lu a body nt about 7 o'clock Inst evening went up to sea their Consul to have tholr altulra etrnlgntened out by thnt able Conluclan jurist.
