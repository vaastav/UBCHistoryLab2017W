N» U** >Mtf *■" '- ■ OUR SMIPLESS COAST In tin- Mr|) history of the I"" West, all its enterprises ivcrc at the mercy of the Kast—of an cast that knew about .i> much of the needs ami resources ol the Pacific states as it did oi irrigation on Mars. In It- early phase, transportation was along fast and west lines. Competition was lacking and shippers were cinched, In the future, transportation must ''-' north ami south and fan sh&pcd as well. The Pacific coast now has capitalists of its own, who know its needs, and who "talk the western language]' —men who have money to finance big enterprises. A new spirit n The United Pacific States have been lonjj enough tethered by a 2,500 mile umbilical cord to the biy eastern terminals and manufacturing centers. It is foolish to pay freight on our raw products 2.000 miles, then pay for having it worked up into manufactured Koods and then pay freight on the manufactured goods 2,000 mile* back again. Tor this reason structural steel works and factories of all kinds nrc springing Up on the coast, and western merchants and contractors are learning to place a portion of their orders with home manufacturers. We need/ also, huge ship yards. for this new factory output ami for finding wider market*, for our farm products, better means of transportation mint la found. Vast harbor improvements are urgently needed, all along the coast; but with our merchant marine reduced to six ship* and a few lumber schooners, and the Japanese, French, Ger> nun and English vessels carrying all our freight, we arc merely digging harbors for the use of foreign ships. We arc blowing in 200 million dollars in digging a ditch across the isthmus, but, except in time of war, we will have M usd for it. We haven't even a tramp freighter to go through it, but it will serve Japan, Germany and England well. America has the most phenomenal lake shipping in the world, and a line coastwise trade; but only 7 per cent of the ocean traffic is left to her, and that is dwindling fast. This is due to the American fear of the subsidy bugaboo. That this fear is not justified is down by the phenomenal growth of Japanese and German ocean shipping under government and local subsidies. They have swept our flag from the seas. If we arc to cease paying 200 million dollars a year in freights to foreign ships, congress must pay our shipowners some sort of liberal bonus on mail contract:! and for naval subventions. Our merchant marine Is on the retrograde for two reasons: Kirst. the standard of living and of wages for American seamen is'higher than for those <•! any other country. Second, our competitor* receive government money for carrying the mails as part of the wages of the sailors, for the u*e of the ships as naval auxiliaries and as direct subsidies. It is time the Pacific coast states were standing together in a demand that congress give similar encouragement to the lattencd-out American shipping business. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE . In other columns today is printed what, in all probability, will be the final message of 1 'resilient Roosevelt to congress. 'As a presidential communication it will stand comparison with executive documents that have issued from other hands in pa&t administrations, but as a.Roosevcltian contribution it is disappointing. It is so proper, becalmed and dignified, that the ordinary reader would demand sight of the signature before surrendering his doubt as to its authenticity. The message in reality is • -ecapitnlation of previous ones, sent formally or periodically as the occasion demanded, by the president during his seven, years in the White House. It contains nothing new, strange or startling, and few, if any, departures from the conservative lines of this form of compe tition. In dealing with the courts, labor, corporations, national preservation prospects, the army, navy, insular poMMM •!•». the future of the Philippines, the old principles arc re-annunciated in Ike tone of a man whose work is nearly done and who is tired. There is no baring of teeth, clenching of fist*, nothing strenuous, nothing even remotely suggestive of a frazzle. The only Theodortc transgression of presidential taste i» the reference to the opposition of labor in the campaign to the courts and Republican candidate in the matter of injunction*. Campaign allegations, until the recent moment, have not been considered worthy of mention on these occasion*. A "Me and '•ill" note sprawl* into one paragraph, in which the president pays a doubtless jnsl tribute to the judicial integ rity of the president-elect, but which suggest* that perhaps a less conspicuous personal friend might have sufficed for the comparison. These are small matters, hardly» mcntionablc, but Mr. Roosevelt has educated the public to look for meat-ax surgery "ii the body politic, economic and social, and we miss the echoes of the chopping block. Til. message has some interest to the people of Washing ton, in that it makes recommendations for the conservation of the.Columbia river salmon. To the people of Seattle, the absence of any reference to the many in--1- ..I Alaska will be the cause of wonderment. It is more than likely that the president considers that he has done all that his time will •per mit for onr Ing sister t>f the north, ami he leaves that weighty task for the fresher energies of his sneccssor. ' All in all, the message is safe, logical and reasonable. Whatever quibbles may: be made over its form or diction, none can find much serious fault with its common sense.
