Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen Officials Say They Have Troubles of Their Own Without Taking On Those of the Switchmen—Compan ies Contemplating Raise. Hv Associated Press.) Chicago, Dec. 6.—The general man agers association of the strike bound railroads of the northwest issued a statement' tonight declaring that there would be no gloomy Christmas for anyone because of inability of the roads to delixer Xmas freight. "At the close of the sixth day of the swltchmens strike," reads the statement, "We have shown greater progress than any day since the strike was called. That we feel lit tle concern about our ability to move Christmas merchandise, live stock and perishable freight, is evidenced by the fact that all lines continue to accept traffic to and from all points without restriction, and that unless conditions- were practically normal, it can .readily be determined that the railroads would hardly continue to accept freight to fill up their termin als and freight houses at the risk of enormous Josses.'* The railroad conference cimmittee is at work: obtaining authority from the lines involved to meet a commit tee from the swltchmens union. New York, Dec. 6.—"Rumors of an Impending «triker" said Vice Presi dent Murdock of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen today, "Are pre mature and' we believe they are cir culated to influence the roads of the northwest into granting demands of the Switchmen's Union of North America. "We have nothing to do with that movement and have troubles enough of our own without entering into any others. "Our proposals have not been sub mitted to the management of rail roads and we have no reasons to sup pose that they will be refused until they are submitted. It is no secret that we have long felt we are entitl ed to higher wages. A demand for them was deferred two years' ago when the financial panic caused-a pause." .In well informed quarters it wasdaBrown's said tonight as the railroads have long contemplated an increase in freight rates, they are not in a posi tion to treat the request for an in crease in wages from their employes too brusquely. 6.—Following is message to Presi- Chicago, Dec.
