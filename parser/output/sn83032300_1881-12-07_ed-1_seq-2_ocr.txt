LANCASTER DAILY liSTLLLlGENCER WEIftESDAl, DECEMBER 7.1881. V vNP of the revenue. The tariff lavs also need revision, bnt that a due regard may be paid te the conflicting interests of our citi zens important changes should be made with caution. If a careful revision cannot be made at this session a commission, such as was lately approved by the Senate and is new recommended by the secretary of the treasury, would doubtless lighten the labors of Congress whenever this subject shall be brought te its consideration. The Army and Navy. The president concurs in the recommen dation of the secretary of war that the army be raised te thirty thousand enlisted men. The report of the secretary of the navy, he says, presents valuable sugges tions for its improvement. I call your es pecial attention, also, te the appendant report of the advisory beard, which he convened te devise suitable measures for increasing the efficiency of the navy, and particulaily te the report as te the charac ter and number of vessels necessary te place it upon a footing commensurate with the necessities of the government. I cannot tee strongly urge upon you my conviction that every consideration of na tional safety, economy and honor impera tively demands a thorough renaouitatien of our navy. We have for many years maintained with foreign governments the relations of honorable peace, and that such relations may be permanent is desired by every patriotic citizen of the republic ; but if we heed the teachings of history, we shall net forget that in the life of every nation emergencies may arise when a resort te arms can alone save it from dishonor. Ne danger from abroad new threatens this people, nor have we any cause te distrust the friendly profes sions of ether governments. But for avoiding as well as rcpclliutr dangers that may threaten us in the future we must be prepared te enforce any policy which wc think wise te adept. We must be ready te defend our harbors against aggression ; te protect by the distribution et our ships of war ever the highways of commerce the varied interests of our foreign trade aud the persons and property of our citi zens abroad ; te maintain everywhere the honor of our flag and the distinguished position which we may rightfully claim among the nations of the world. Thefeatal and Star Itente Service. The report of the postmaster general is a gratifying exhibit of the postal service. The receipts.frem postage and ether ordi nary seurcesduring the past fiscal year were $30,489,816.58 ; the receipts from the money order business were $293. 581. 30, makinjr a total of 3G,785,:7.97. The ex penditure for the fiscal year was $39,251, 746. The deficit supplied out of the gen eral treasury was $2,481,129.35, or C 3-10 per cent, of the amount expended. The receipts were $3,469,918.03 in exc3ss of these of the previous year, and $4,57o,3U7. $4,57e,3U7. 97 in excess of the estimate made four two years age, before the present period of business prosperity had fairly begun. During the past year 338 additional money efliccs have been established, mak ing a total of 5,499 in operation at the date of this report. During the year the do mestic money orders aggregated in value $105,075,709.35. A modification of the system is suggested, reducing the fees for money orders net exceeding $5 from ten cents te live cents and making the maxi mum limit $100 iu place of $50. Legisla tion for the disposition of unclaimed money orders in the possession of the Hstelficc department is recommended, in view of the fact that their teal value new exceeds one million dollars. The atten tion of Congress is again invited te the subject of establishing a system of savings depositaries in connection with the posteffico dcpaitmcut. The se-called star routes have been decreased iu length 3,919 miles, and in cost $364,144. Most all the mere expensive routes have been superseded by railroad service. The cost of the star service must therefore rapidly decrease in the Western states aud territories. The investigations ei the department of justice and the post pest office department have resulted in the pre sen tat ion of indictments agaiust persons formerly connected with that service, ac cusing them of offenses against the United States. I have enjoined upon the officials who arc charged with the conduct of the cases en the part of the government, aud upon the eminent counsel who, before my accession te the presidency, were called te their assistance, the duty of prosecuting with the utmost rigor of the law persons who may be found chargeable witti frauds upon the postal service. Cowboys and Indians. The president refers te the depredations of the " cowboys " in Arizona, and says that in the event of a request from the territorial government for protection by the United States agaiust domestic vio lence this government would be powerless te render assistance. The act of 1795, chapter 36, passed at a time when territor ial governments received little attention from Congress, cuferced this duty of the United States only as te the state govern ments. But the act of 1807, chapter 3D, applied also te the territories. This law seems te have rcmaiued iu force until the revision of the statutes, when the provis previs ion for the territories was dropped. I am net advised whether this alteration was in tentional or accidental, but as it seems te me the territories should be offered the protection which is accorded te the states by the constitution, I suggest legislation te that end. The president calls attention te the report of the secretary of the in terier and says: Piernincnt among the matters which challenge the attention of Congress at its picsent session is the management of our Indian affairs. The president recommends that the Indian have the protection of the law. He should be allowed te maintain in court his rights of person and property. He also recom mends land in severalty and a liberal ap propriation for Indian schools. The Mormons. Regarding Mormeuism the picsidcut says that the existing statute for the puu. ishment of polygamy, se revolting te the moral and religious sense of Christendom, has been persistently and contemptuously violated ever since its enactment. Your attention is called te a recent opinion of the supreme court of the United States ex plaining its judgment of reversal in the case of Miles, who had been convicted et bigamy in Utah. The court refers te the fact that the secrecy attending the cele bration" of marriages in that territory makes the proof el polygamy very diffi cult, aud the propriety is suggested of modifying the law of evidence, which new makes a wife incompetent te tes tify against her husband. This suj gestien is approved. I recommend also the passage of an act providing that in the territories of the United States the fact that a woman has been married te a per son charged with bigamy shall net dis qualify her as a witness upon his trial for that offense I further recommend legis lation by which any person solemnizing marriage in any of the territories shall be required, under stringent penalties for neglect or refusal, te file a certificate of ich marriage in the supreme court of the ritcry. Doubtless Congress may devise practicable measures for obviating flicultics which have hitherto at- he efforts te suppress this iniqui urc you of my determined pur- tpeiate with you in any lawful measure which may be pre- "nd. Service Reform. speaks of the enormous required for arrears in at $250,000,000 for reat temptation te titieus claims af- 'e average sum ion is $1,30.1. -iety of mak mak fer the pre- c&xf ventien of fraud. He advises appropria tions for such internal improvements as the wisdom of Congress may deem te be of public importance. After mentioning the necessity for improving the Mississippi river he takes up the subject of civil service reform and says : Iu my letter ac cepting the nomination for the vice presi dency I stated that, in my judgment, " no man should be the incumbent of an office the duties of which be is for any cause unfit te perform, who is lacking in the ability, fidelity or integrity which a proper administration of such office de mands. This sentiment would doubtless meet with general acquiescence, but opin ion has been widely divided upon the wisdom and practicability of the various reformatory schemes which have been sug gested and of certain proposed regulations governing appointment te public office. The efficiency of such regulations has been distrusted mainly because they have seemed te exalt mere educational aud ab stract tests above general business capa city and even special fitness for the par ticular work iu hand. It seems te me that the rules which should be applied te the management of the public service may properly conform in the main te such as regulate the conduct et successful private business. Origiual appointments should be based upon ascertained fitness. The tenure of office should be stable. Posi tions of responsibility should, se far as possible, be tilled by the prometiou of worthy aud efficient officers. " The investi gation of all complaints and the punish ment of all official misconduct should be prompt and thorough." The President' Premise. The views expressed in the foregoing latter are these which will eevern my ad ministration in the executive office. They are doubtless shared by all intelligent and patriotic citizens, however divergent in their opinions us te the best methods of putting them into practical operation, Fer example, the assertion that " original appointments should be based upon ascertained fitness " is net open te dis pute. But the question hew in practice such fitness can be most effectually ascer tained is one which has for years excited interest and discussion.The measure which, with slight variations in details, has lately been urged upon the attention of Congress and the executive, has as its principal fea ture the scheme of competitive examina tion. Save for certain exceptions, which need net here be specified, this plan would give admission te the service only in its lowest grade, and would accordingly de mand that all vacancies in higher positions should be filled by promotion alone. In these particulars it is in conformity with the existing civil service of Great Britain. And, indeed, the success which has attend ed that system in the country of iis biith is the strongest argument which has been urged for its adoption here. The fact should net, however, be over looked that there arc certain features of the English system which have net gen erally Ujjcn received with faver in this coun try, even among the foremost advocates of civil service reform. Among them are : First, a tenure of office which is substan tially a life tenure; second, a limitation el the maximum age at which an applicant can enter the service, whereby all men in middle life or elder are, with seme excep tions, rigidly excluded ; third, a retiring allowance upon going out of office. These three elements arc as important factors of the problem as any of the ethers. Te eliminate them from the English system would effect a most radical change in its theory and practice. The avowed purpose of that system is te induce the educated young men of the country te devote their lives te public employment by an assur ance that having once entered upon they need never leave it, and that upon volun tary retirement they shall be the recipi ents of an annual pension. That this sys tem as an entirety has proved very succes f ul in Great Britain seems te be generally conceded, even by these who once opposed its adoption. Te a statute which should incorporate all its essential features I should feel bound te give my approval, but whether it would be for the best in terests of the .public te fix upon an ex pedient for immediate extensive ap plication, which embraces certain features of the English system, but excludes or ig nores ethers of equal importance, may be seriously doubted even by these who arc impressed, as I am myself, with the grave importance of correcting the evils which inhere in the present methods of appoint ments. If, for example, the English rule, which shuts out all persons above the age of twenty-five years from a large number of public employments, is net te be made an essential part of our system, it is ques tionable whether the attainments of the highest number of marks at a competitive examination should be the criterion by which all applications for appointments should be put te test. And under similar conditions it may also be questioned whether admission te the service should be strictly limited te its lowest ranks. The English System, Tne present English system is a growth of years, and was net created by a single stroke ex executive or legislative action. Its beginnings are found in an order in council promulgated in 1855, and it was after patient and cautious scrutiny of its workings that fifteen years later it took its present shape, five years atter the is suance of the order in council, and at a time when resort had been had te competi tive examinations as an experiment much mere extensively than has yet been the case in this country, a select committee of the Heuse of Commens made a report te that Heuse, which, declaring its approval of the competitive plan, deprecated, never theless, any precipitancy in its general adoption,as likely te endanger its ultimate success. During this tentative period the results of the two methods of pass exami nation were closely watched and com pared. It may be that before wc confine ourselves upon this important question within the stringent bounds of statutory enactment wc may profitably await the re sult of further inquiry and experiment. The submission of a portion of the nomina tions te a central beard of examiners se lected solely for testing the qualifications of applicants may, perhaps, without resort te the competitive test, put an end te the mischiefs which attend the present sys tem of appointment, and it may be feasible te vest in such a beard a wide discretion te ascertain the true characteristics and at tainments of candidates in these particu lars which I have already referred te as being no less important than mere intel lectual attainments. If Congress should deem it advisable at the present session te establish competitive tests for admission te the service no doubts, such as have been suggested, shall deter me from giving the measure my earnest support, and I urgent ly recommend, should there be a failure te pass any ether act upon this subject, that an appropriation of $25,000 per year may be made for the enforcement of section 1,753 of the revised statutes. With the aid thus afforded me I shall try te execute the previsions of that law according tp its letter and spirit. I am unwilling, in jus t:c3 te the present civil servants of the gov ernment, te dismiss this subject without declaring my dissent from the severe and almost indiscriminate censure with which they have been recently assailed. That they are, as a class, indolent, ineffi cient and corrupt, Is a statement which has often been made and widely credited; but wuen uic uiieui, variety, uencacy ana im portance of their duties are considered, the great majority of the employees of the government are, in my judgment, deserv ing of high commendation. The president recommends te Congress the subject of the decline of the merchant marine, tic docs net pretend te indicate the remedy for it, but regards immediate attention as important. He thinks that there would have been me decline if we had given te our navigation interests a portion of the aid and protection which have been se wisely bestowed upon our manufacturers. The message concludes with a reference te the presidential inability, as suggested by the situation which existed during most et the past summer, but he does net indi cate what he thinks should be done. iLtmcasjter Intelligencer. 

WBDNE3DAY EVENING, DEC. 7, 1881. The President's Message. The president has sent te Congress a long and able message that will be read with interest and willrepay perusal a which is something that in these hitter days is net often te be said of presiden tial messages. Upen our foreign rela tions much is said, but net net much of significance. Where information is specially looked for as te the government policy, in our relations namely witH Chili and Peru, we de net learn any thing save that it is the president's de sire that these nations shall become friendly, and that te secure that end he has sent out " a special envoy accredited te all and each of them and furnished with general instructions which will," he trusts, " enable him te bring these powers into friendly rela tions." What these instructions are we de net hear, and cannot judge hew the president's desire is supported by his judgment. The fact appears, however, that he considers it the business of the United States te interfere in these Seuth American imbroglios, and te impress its views upon the governments. It fellows naturally that he proposes te sustain them with the power of our country, and that he would net shrink from involving us in war en their account. The same policy is indicated in the position taken in regard te the Panama canal, the view stated by Mr. Blaine in his recent mani festo being sustained,- and the ad ditional information being given us that the slate of Colombia in whose ter ritory the canal lies had itself sug gested te the European powers that they should join in a guaranty of the neu trality of the canal. Mr. Arthur pro poses that we shall have no partners in this guaranty, notwithstanding Colom bia herself desires thn. He considers that the junction of the European powers in the guaranty " would be in direct contravention of our obligation as te the sole guaranty of the integrity of Colombian territory and of the neutrality of the canal itself." It seems a trifle odd te object te assistance in tiie dis charge of our obligation, as a contraven tion of it ; and it might have been mere frank te have used the word "privilege" instead of " obligation" when the obliga tion is se manifestly treated as a privi lege. We consider it very debatable whether the position taken is sound in its policy ; it is net clear that the inter ests of this country are se intimately connected with these of the Seuth American continent as te make it ad vantageous for us te set up a protector ate ever it, and warn oil all European intruders from the premises. The obli gations assumed may be se onerous as te make the whistle tee dear. The president wants au increase in the army and navy, as might be inferred from the favor he shows te our interven tion in the affairs of our neighbors. lie also wants authority te use United States troops in the suppression of dis turbances in the territories, where white men, and net Indians only, arc te be coerced. This suggestion seems te be unobjectionable. He considers our pre sent Indian policy wise and thinks that Indian schools, the conveyance of plots of land te Indian families,inalienable for twenty or twenty-five years, and the ex tension of the laws of the states and territories ever the Indians within their borders, te be the essential elements in a proper Indian policy. Se far as these recommendations go probably they are wise ; but they de net embrace all the features that go te make up a successful solution of the Indian problem. If Gen. Miles should be made commissioner of Indian affairs, with full powers te in troduce and execute his very correct ideas of Indian policy, the country might well be content te await the results. Of civil service reform the president speaks sensibly. He says that he would approve a mcjisure that would include all the features of such a policy, introduc ing men at an early age into the system by competitive examination, promoting them for efficiency, retaining them for life or geed behavior, and retiring them en pensions. But he will notapprevcof a system which emits any of these ele ments te the perfection of the system. Aud he manifestly doubts whether even the perfected system is adapted for use inthis country. Certainly there are grave objections te it, as there are great advan tages. We cordially agree with him in his distrust of competitive ex aminations as a successful means of selecting successful men. There are many ether things needed in the perfect man that are mere essential than book knowledge or even intellectual capacity, which an examination into a candidate's knowledge does net detect. The presi dent enumerates some of them in " pro bity, industry, geed sense, geed habits, geed temper, patience, ardor, courtesy, tact, self-reliance ;" and he might well have added as net less important, deci sion, promptitude, quickness, judgment and activity. In short, character is mere important than knowledge te the suc cessful man, and the disastrous failures of high graduates at college in the active walks of life does net commend diplomas of teachers as certificates of men's su premacy. The president has written his message and delivered it te Congress aud the country ; he has elected his speaker and Congress is new ready for business. But the new administration has net met and passed any of the perils of a voyage. Its bark is only launched. The storms and billows are yet te come. Mr. Arthur is a politician and a Stalwart. He has given unmistakable signs of this, and his faction of the party will expect from him all that this implies. Where they are in office they expect te stay in, and where the Half-Breeds are in possession the Stalwarts will expect them te be put out. The sententious "see Cameren " raises hopes that the friends of that pe culiar statesman will expect te have realized. All Western Pennsylvania is convulsed ever the McKcespert posteffice matter ; what would happen if Cameren and Smith would lock-horns ever the Lancaster collectership. Or did Smith make his peace and Wiley's calling sure by his vote for Keifer for speaker? There are mere holes in Pennsylvania than there are pegs for them', and when they begin te put the Cameren pegs into the anti-Cameren places the mettle of the administration will be best tested. m m As an "Independent Republican organ" for reform within the party lines what does the iVcie Em think of A. Herr Smith's vote for Cameren's can didate for speaker ? SUlUlDH OF 

WAKKKN WOODWARD His Bedy Discovered Three Dajs After the Spooling. Warren Woodward, atterney-at-Iaw, aged 27 years, the only son of the late Warren J. Woodward, justice of the su promo court of Pennsylvania, was found in his room in Heading yesterday, shot through the head. The body, when found, was in an advanced state of decomposition and had evidently lain there for some time. The last seen of Woodward was en Saturday evening, when he told some of his friends that he was going te leave the city en a visit. This was thought te be the case until a party of friends concluded te visit his rooms, which are in the law building of Geerge F. Baer. The rooms occupied are three in number and are elegantly furnished, the front one being a library, in which is said te De tne nnest selection of books in the state, left te the deceased by his father. One of the rooms is occupied as a bed chamber, aud iu this, after the deer was broken open, was found the lifeless body of the young lawyer stretched at full length en the bed, with the revolver still clasped in his hand, which was lying across his breast. De ceased has but oae sister, married te F. B. Howe, of Danville, seu of Bishop Howe. The body was taken in charge by friends and the relatives living in Wilkcsbarre notified. The funeral will take place at that point. Woodward graduated from Princeton cellege in 187G. Came Back and Married Uer. James P. Weller, the lever whose strauge conduct in deserting beautiful Bessie Nor Ner ris, of Wilkcsbarre, en the morning of their wedding day caused much comment, and who returned subsequently te find the peer girl prostrated with brain fever, made things all right yesterday morning by marrying his affianced. The affair is most remarkable in many respects. The sud den flight of the lever threw Miss Norris en a bed of sickness, where she lay be tween life and death for many days. Upen Weller's return he went te see her. He was refused admission te the house by the lady's mother. He pushed his way in and caunht her iu his arms as she was ap proaching him from her sick couch. After that the physicians ordered him te remain by her. He did se, nursing her until she was out of danger. She was willing te forgive him for his conduct, the mother's objections were overcome, and yesterday the two were married in the bride's home. Miss Norris was robed in a magnificent bridal costume, and the ceremonies was performed under a large floral horse-shoe. A houseful of guests enjoyed a grand wedding breakfast, and the newly-married couple subsequently started en a tour te Flerida. Municipal Elections. Municipal elections were held in a num ber of the cities and towns of Massachu setts yesterday, and the question of license was also voted en. In Springfield a Democratic mayor and Republican beard of aldermen and council were chosen. Lawrence also elected a Democratic mayor and chose a Democratic majority of the ether city officers. In Fitchburg a Pro hibition mayor was chosen, license defeat ed, and the Citizens' ticket for common council elected. In Gloucester, Haverhill, Cambridge and Semcrville, the Citizens' candidates for mayor were elected and license defeated. Newton elected a Re publican mayor and council and rejected license. The local election in New Haven yester day resulted in the election of the Demo cratic city ticket by majorities ranging from 1351 te 1781. The Democrats have a majority of 7 in the beard of aldermen and 8 in common council. LOCAL INTELLIGENCE. A NOTED FEMALE TUIEF. Melinda Elliett Again In Custody for ltob lteb bing Shirt Manufacturer!). Melinda Elliett, alias Mewrcy, alias Fisher, formerly of Lancaster, who has figured en the annals of the Philadelphia police department for years past as an adroit thief, was yesterday given a hearing before Magistrate Seuth en the charge of larceny as bailee. It was in evidence that the woman had obtained flannel te the value of $50 from II: & S. Sternberger, 503 Market street, en the representation that she was a seamstress in search of work, She gave a fictitious residence. About the same time she obtained $22 worth of goods from J. Black & Ce., en Fourth street above Chestnut, under the name of Mrs. Fisher, of Ne. 2710 Federal street, but also neg lected te return the work. The magistrate asked the prisoner what she did with the goods, te which she replied : " They have found me ; let them find the goods new." She was held iu $1,G00 bail for a further hearing. The prisoner is the wife of Themas Elliett, who was arrested about three years age for the robbery of a large number of dwelling houses at which she had obtained employment as a domestic. They were both convicted, and when the woman was arraigned for sentence iu court upon eighteen bills of indietmeut which had been found azainst her, she assumed a flippant air which indicated that she wa3 indifferent te her fate. She received a sentence of . one month upon each bill. A number of ether charges arc still pending against her. Bobbers About. Yesterday was wash-day at Mrs. Hugh Dougherty's, East Orange street. The weather being unfavorable for drying clothes, they were te be left en the lines en the lawn all night. Mrs. Dougherty thinking it risky te leave them there all night, made a survey of the premises about half-past ten o'clock. She moved cautious ly te where the clothes were hanging when suddenly she came face te face with a large, muscular fellow who was in the act of removing some of the clothing. A t sight of her he dropped the plunder and beat a hasty retreat. Net te be daunted by thieves, she closely pursued him. As he scaled the high pale fence she draw her self te the top, and with a broom-handle drawn en the fellow, commanded him te step or she would sheet. He heeded net, but scaled another fence and was soea lest te sight. Houiebeld Market, We had rather a wet morning for mar ket, and the attendance was net quite as large as usual. There was no change in the prices of articles offered, and no ether feature of the market worthy of note, ex cept that the stalls are beginning te dis play a greater abundance of Christmas luxuries, as the great holiday approaches.

He was gene a few minutes and returned te cut off the flew, when te his dismay he found that instead of the boilers being filled they were nearly empty. Iu frightened haste he went te the engineer and asked why he had stepped the force pump, aud was told that the engineer thought he was done filling. Au attempt was made te start the force pump, when it was discovered that it would net work. The news spread in au instaut, and the greatest excitement prevailed. Orders were issued for the lire te be " drawn," and as this was done in time, it saved us from reporting an accident by which many lives would have been lest and the build ing blown te pieces.

L1UIIT AVAMTEw. Scaling Down Hie Lamp mil. Last evening the lamp committee of city councils met in the select council chamber for the purpose of passing upon the bill of the PennsylvaniaGlebe Gaslight company, of Philadelphia, for lighting the street lamps during the month of November. Every member of the committee was present Messrs. Smcych, White, Philip Zcchcr and Barr, chairman and the super intendent of lighting, Miles Fite, was also a participant in the deliberations. It was seen from the police reports for the month that the number of lamps which went out at various hours during the night, togeth er with a small proportion that had net been lit at all, amounted te 481. As the cost of each lamp te the city is about seven cents per night it was resolved te make a proportionate reduction upon the bill for the insufficient service thus shown, aud $33 was deducted from the month's chaigcs. The members of the committee also discuss ed the inferior quality of the light that has latterly bceu furnished, being far below the " sixtccn-candle " power premised in the articles of agreement. Seme of the committeemen stated that many of the lamps have recently been showing no greater degree of brilliancy than a single tallow dip. Upen this point Superintend ent Fite premised great improvement, and en the strength of his assurance the clerk was directed te notify the company that they would be granted one month's grace, and if by that time the lamps were net burnintr mere satisfactorily severer meas ures would be reEerted te, te sccuie com pliance with the terms of the contract and better light for the city.

Vels., Colonel Hambiight commanding; serving during the war in the department of the Cumber laud, under Generals Grant, Themas and Garfield. During his term eTserviee he was in charge of bevcral of the large hospitals established en the line of march from Nashville te Atlanta. The one at King King seon, Ga., had 1,500 paticuts. The pub-9 lished medical records mention the val uable service efDr. Wrigut,j net only as an accomplished surgeon, hat as a su perior executive3 officer. In 1873 he was appointed surgeon of the Natienil home for disabled volunteers at Hamp ton, Va., and iu 1373 was transferred te a like institution in Augusta, Maine. Iu 1874 he was compelled te resign en ac count of declining health. His admin; istratien at the Soldiers' National home was highly commended by these iu au thority. The secret of his success was iu enforcing the best possible sauitary regu lations, in which he recognized the truth of the adage that prevention is better than cure. On leaving the home the officers and men presented the Dr. with a very handsome geld meuuted ebony cane, as a mark of esteem for his professional abili ties and the geed will they bore him as a soldier friend. "Dr. Wright was au eminently pious man aud Christian gentleman. During his residence iu Pittsburgh he was a rul ing elder in Christ church. He never fal tered iu his devotion te Christianity, and in no relation will he be greater nibsed than iu the church. He leaves six chil dren besides a brother and sister. Peace te hi3 ashes." THE DUAMA. Miss Jeffreys -Lewis in Keine.' Twe Klnbt.H in At Fulton opera house last evening Miss Jeffreys-Lewis gave a very powerful n n- rescntatien of the character of Antenia, in Guntcr's melodramatic composition " Twe Nights iu Reme." The role is ene calling for high histrionic ability in its proper executieu, and Miss Jeffreye-Lewis meets all the requirements admirably, possessing in special degree the physical attributes and the mental capacity ncccs sary te furnish a true characterization of the dramatist's conceit of the heartless, vindictive, wicked woman. Of the play itself " much may be-said en both sides ;" it has points of great strength and ethers of singular weakness, the greatest of which latter perhaps is that it really does net end at all with the final drop of the curtain, and you are left in painful unceitaiuty as te the ultimate fate of Antenia, against whom her Corsican hus band has sworn the oath of the vendetta. But its points of merit and demerit have been noted at length in our previous review of the piece, se that it is net neces sary te dwell at length upon them new. It needs some judicious and practical over hauling before it can be classed as a dra matic success. The supporting cast in last night's performance was" of respectable mediocrity. The attraction at the opera house to night is one that invites the patronage of levers of light comedy and wholesome fun. " The Professer," as represented by the Madisen Square cempauy, is pursuing a triumphal tour ever the country in which that eccentric personage is extending the scope of his success iu the most flattering manner. Here in n Chancr, Taking up the cue where Forepaugh left it, the Barnum, Bailey & Hutchinson circus peeple offer a rare chauce te the fortunate persons who shall prove them selves te be possessed in the largest degree of the attributes of physical beauty. They propose te give $20,000 for the most beau tiful lady, and $10,000 for the handsomest man, who shall contract for the sums stated te exhibit themselves at the " great est show en earth," of which Messrs. Bar num, Bailey & Hutchinseu are joint pro prietors. These gentlemen stoutly aver that the offer is bona fide, and the money will be paid in solid cash te the winners, and moreover, they want it distinctly un derstood that they desire no professional beauties or anything of that sort ; their champion must be from the private walks of life. Elsewhere is priuted the glowing advertisement containing this tempting offer. Lancaster has long boasted of the female loveliness and manly beauty com prised within her borders. Will thcre be any contestants for the Barnum prizes from this city ? Cnurgca With Larceny. A. S. Stiller, of Intercourse, was ar rested by Constable Warfel, en Monday, aud had a partial heariug yesterday before Alderman Barr, en charge of larceny. When arrested he had in his possesien two geld rings aud a geld pencil which were stolen from the stores of Ezra Bewman and A. Rheada, jewelers of this ciiy. There were many ether articles in his house supposed te have been 'stolen, but none of them have been identified or claimed. A charge of receiving stolen goods was preferred against Mr. Miller's daughter, but the charge against her was dismissed. She acknowledged tlrat her father gave her the jewelry, but denied knowing tbat it was stolen, and there was no proof te the contrary. Miller was re committed for a further hearing, and, he claims te have a geed defence. He is a clock-maker by trade and has heretofore borne a geed name. " l'atrletle Belie a. Silas W.
