FROM EDITOR TO AUDITOR The Farmers' Institute Discussed By Some Old Timers "1 suppose you will attend the far mers' institute next week?" "Yes sir." "Will there be a good attendance?" "I don't know. A good many farmers have told me they were coming in. The whole population ought to come." "Why don't they?" "Well, they may all come, but usually they do not." "What's been the past experience?" "When we have had institutes hereto fore, the weather has generally been cold, or the farmers, if it was in summer have been very busy. We have two ■classes of farmers here: one class works too hard and reads and thinks too little. Another class doesn't think nor work enough} nor with systematic plans, and when they read, they read trash in stead of something helpful." "So?" 'Yes." "What does the trashy fellow read?" "If he is a cigarette smoker he reads detective stories. These two things never develop a very strong mind nor good reasoning powers. If he is a fellow ■of better habits and a half way reformer he reads long winded articles on the tar iff and "Appeal to Reason." Neither.of them help him very much to plow or plant or irrigate or select his seeds or stock or any of those things which till the bin and the stackyard." "What should he read?" "He should read anything that applies to local conditions and enables him to work more intelligently. Every voca tion, every trade has its literature now 1 days, and the farmer not only has papers and magazines devoted to his calling, but he has the Deparment of Agricul ture, one of the greatest departments of the government to help him. He has the widest scope for exercising his tal «nts or ingenuity, but right here he seems to be using but very little of ■either. He just works and works. We simply jog along and raise a pretty good crop of the kind that we have been raising, seldom make special preparation or give it special care or get especially good results." "What experiments would you make here?" ~ "A man doesn't need to experiment. The state does enougn of that. Then it sends out the experimenters to hold meeting among the people to tell them of the results. They take a lotofappar atus along to give stereopticon views, so the audience can learn the results of a season's experiments in an hour. The state pays the expense of the season's experiments and pays the experimentors to go out and teach the people. Yet the CHRISTMAS GIVIN G IS THE GREATEST CHRISTMAS JOY t This year we have opened up rather the newest ideas in Christmas Gifts that wc have in a good many years. Thiigs are dainter and prettier than usual. There is not a bit of use trying to tell you what all we have, We Simply say: Come in and see for yourself. We shall be glad to see you and show you anything and everything in the store. Our stock is all new, no carried over stuff. o LHAVE you looked at our framed pictures X '.J p Q Lowney's Christmas Candies are Finer than Ever See Our Japanese Window This Week YOURS FOR CHRISTMAS TRADE ALL THE YEAR 'ROUND AND PALACE DRUG STORE mass of farmers do not attend these meetings." "What's the matter with them'.'" "Several things. Some think it has no value because it is offered to them free of charge. They do not appreciate a good government with its free institu tions. There are others so absorbed in | their own plans and work that they do < not care to leave it even for a day. they go to an institute and learn a great i deal, but nothing which applies directly j to their most pressing needs, they go home feeling that the time has not been well spent, when in reality they have re ceived a lot of information along lines that will be of use to them so long as they live. Receiving some helps this winter and applying them next summer is the way to get results. If this country ever amounts to any thing it must be the agriculturist who makes it. If the present inhabitants do not achieve anything it will be done by those who succeed them. The charac ter and temper of the people of these settlements will be shown in the way they respond to thN invitation to meet with the representatives of better agri culture at the institute next Friday, and every merchant and other business man will do well to be there to see who at tends the meetings. Allowing for a few loafers who go to everything, the meet ing will be made up of the men who have the best crops, drive the best horses, milk the best cows and pay their bills best. No community ever becomes great without great effort, and when you look into the institute next.Friday you can make a pretty good forecast of the ad vancement which the agricultural inter ests will make in the next twelve months, or while the present inhabitants are in the majority." If Something in Sight. The increase of business at the Black foot post office indicates that it may be raised to a second class office next year. That will give us more clerks and better service. Buy all the stamps and stamp ed envelops you can during December, January and February, and help swell the business for that quarter. Then if we pass the required rating on the March report it will be a short road to special delivery of mail at our door and offices. People in Blaekfoot are entitled to as good postal service as those on the rural routes fifteen miles out on the plains. Shelly-Melville.

DESERTED HER CHILDREN. Heartless Treatment of Offspring is | Before the Court. | Mrs. Lizzie Weeks, the daughter of Thos. Blaylock, former residents of this locality, lies in jail at Blaekfoot for de sertion of her two children, aged two and four years. Home years ago this family of Blay locks lived for a brief season on the Trego ranch, I ranch was mighty sor ry, i and moved from there to Idaho Falls. The father now lives at Ontario, Oregon, but this daughter who married a Mr. Weeks at the age of fifteen, hasn't had any particular husband for same time, and recently has not even been particu lar. so the evidence showed at the pre liminary examination. She was called on the carpe t by county attorney . I McCracken on the charge of desertion of the children, her step-mother at Idaho Falls being the complaining witness. She deserted the children at Idaho Falls and went to Pocatello, had a very good time for a while and then went to Minidoka where she again took up the thread of gaiety of the shady or der. Iri the preliminary examination she did not seem depressed about {he du ties of motherhood, said she was looking out for a good time for herself, and was unmoved when the step mother describ ed how she had stood in her homo and cursed the two year-old daughter, who was crying and holding out its little arms pleadingly toward the bosom from which it had lately been weaned. She is a rather attractive looking girl f twenty-one years, andJudge Faekrell bound her over to await the action of the If found guilty of deser tion she will be sentenced to not less district court, than one, nor more than seven years in the penitentiary. Now ladies, W. ('. T. U s. White Rib boners, Leaguers, Endeaverors, people who carry flowers to prisoners or soften the heart of stone with the memories clinging 'round the fragrance of the mignonette, here is a chance to exercise some of your original ideas. This girl is a child of the frontier, had little eduea tion beyond learning to read and write, scarcely remembers her mother, had a lazy, dishonest father,developed early in womanhood, and was permitted to "run with the boys" as soon, and as much as she chose, We have a reform school at St. An thony for younger people, and over at Boise is a home kept up by benevolent folks, where wayward girls may go and enable them to get a new start in the world, but it is doubtful whether a char receive shelter, and learn something to actor like this one could be kept there any longer than you could keep a skin nod mink looking fat and j ri up to somebody. cunning.
