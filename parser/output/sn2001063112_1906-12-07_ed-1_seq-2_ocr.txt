ROOSEVELT FILES HIS MESSAGE TO CONGRESS Nation's Chief Executive Would Bar Campaign Contributicns From Corporations. FOR INHERITANCE TAX Handles the Negro Question Without Gloves, Saying Blacks Must Not Be Allowed to Grow Up in Ignor ance—Denounces Lynching. "Washington, Dec. 4.— Demanding that Beath be the penalty for rape and callin for the enactment of a national law governing divorces, President Roosevelt's message was read to the two branches of congress today and was greeted with cheers. The president sticks to phonetic spelling to some extent but uses the old fashioned style in most cases. Prominent among the features of trie document are Mr, Roosevelt's recommendation that a law be passed prohibiting all corporations from contributing to campaign funds, a law such as has already been passed by ono branch of congress, his declaration that it would be wrong to prevent the use Of injunctions, his bitter denunciation of .Vnching, his good words for the further ance of a general eight hour day, his de mand for a "thoro" probe into the ques tion of woman and child labor, his as sertion that it is wise that progress along Inheritance tax lines should be gradual, his urging of the passage of a ship sub sidy bill, his statement that the present currency system is seriously defective and Ms warning to Cuba that she must be -.r. good. The president also declares that the White race cannot afford to let the negroes grow up in Ignorance, says the income tax stands on an entirely different footing trom the inheritance tax because it in volves no question of the perpetuation of fortunes "swollen to an unhealthy size," and calls the attention of congress to the aeed of passing a bill limiting the hours of employment of railroad employes. Mr. Roosevelt states that effort should not oe made to put combines out of business £ut to prevent them from doing injury to ihe public. A particularly strong para graph is that in which the chief executive •panics the Pacific coast for its anti-Jap anese sentiment and lauds the mikado's Country as a prime friend of Uncle Sam. The muck raking magazine writers come In for some caustic remarks. The message starts out by saying: As a nation we still continue to enjoy 9. literally unprecedented prosperity and It is probable that only reckless specula tion and disregard of legitimate business methods on the part of the business world can materially mar this prosperity. Congress is then complimented and the president next takes up the matter of corporation contributions to campaign funds. He says: I again recommend a law prqhibiting all corporations from contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a pill has already past one house of con frees. Let individuals contribute as they desire but let us prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making con tributions for any political purpose, di rectly or indirectly. Injunction. Passing to the question of injunctions, the president says: In my last message I suggested the en actment of a lav/ in connection with the .ssuance of injunctions, attention having been sharply drawn to the matter by the leuiand that the right of applying injunc tions in labor cases should be wholly abol ished. It is at least doubtful whether a /aw abolishing altogether the use of in junctions in such cases would stand the test of the courts in- which case of course the legislation would be ineffective. Moreover, I believe it would be wrong al together to prohibit the use of injunctions. It is criminal to permit sympathy for jsriminals to weaken our hands in uphold ing the law and if men seek to destroy life or property by mob. violence there Should be no impairment of the power of the cpurts to deal with them in the most summary end effective way possible. Hut Possible the abuse of the power should be provided against by some such tew as I advocated last vear Of course a judg-a strong enough to be fit for his office v/ill enjoin anv resort to violence or intimidation, especially by conspiracy, no matter what his opinion jnay be of the rights of the original quar rel. There must be no hesitation in deal jng with disorder. But there must like wise be no such abuse of th* injunctive power as is implied in forbidding: laborim vnen to strive for their own betterment in peaceful and lawful ways: nor must the injunction be used merely to aid some bier corporation in carrying: out schemes for Us own aggrandizement. It must be re membered that a preliminary injunction Hi a labor case, if granted without ade quate proof (even when authority can be found to support the conclusions of law pn which it is founded), may often sottle tne dispute between the parties and there fore if improperly granted may do irre parable wrong. Justice and Courage. The two important elements of moral character .in a ,iudge are an earnest desire to reach a just conclusion and courage to enforce it Insofar as fear of public comment does not affect the courage of a judge, but only spurs him on to search his conscience and to reach the result which approves -tself to his inmost* heart, such comment serves a useful puipose. There »re few men, whether they are judges for life or for a shorter term, who do not pre fer to earn and hold the respect of all. and 5ar?v?°* J" eac VrH,l ra and made to pause ^4by, nos public criticism. J" cafe, of judges having a life tenure, Vi^u very independence makes the right freely to comment on their decisions of• greater importance, because :t is the enly practical and available instrument in the hands of a free people to keep such judges al.ve to the reasonable demands of those they serve. Lynching. In connection with the delays of th^ law. your attention and the attention of the nation to the prevalence of crime among us, and above all to the epidemic of lynching and mob violence that springs up. low «.* °1S rl of our country, now in another. Each section, north, south, east f'W 5 as 8 ow ,faults no section can with wisdom spend its t'.me Jeering at the faults of another section it should be busv 3?JFji •MIr^n5 own shortcomings, io deal with the crime of corruption it Is to av an ry awakened public conscience, and to supplement this by whatever leg.slatlon will add speed and ceitainty in the execution of the law. When we-deal w'.th lynching even more is r^, A great many white men are Uncheo, but the crime Is peculiarly fre quent in respect to black men. The great est exsting cause of lynching is the per petration, especially by black men of the cr !?\1 o£ ra —the most' abom- Jnable in all the catesorv of crimes evon Vj,an murder. Mobs freouenily avenge the commission of tli^s crimc bv themselves torturing to death the msn committing it thus avenging in b»st'al fashion a bestial ored, and .oJuclnj? them selves to a level with the criminal Lawlessness grows by what It feeds upon and when mobs begin to lynch for rape they speedily extend the sphere of the.r operations and lynch for many other .lends of crimes, so that two-thirds of the Ijrnchlngs are not for rape at all: while a considerable proportion of the individuals lynched are innocent of all crime On His Real Worth. Moreover, where any crime committed py a member of one race against a mem ber_of another race is avenged in such fashion that it seems as if net the indi .. vidual criminal, but the whole race, is at 't tacked, the result is to exasperate to tlie highest degree race feeling. There :s but roue-safe rule In dealing with black men as With white men it :s the same rule that must be applied dealing with rich iron :*nd poor men: that is, to treat eich man, whatever his color, his creed or his so-'al |Msition, with even-handed justice on his Worth cs a man. White people owe it quite as inueh to themselves as to the colored race to treat well the colored man who shows by his life that he deserves such treatment for it is t-siirely tha high est wisdom to oncourage in the eolorod race all those individuals who are hon est.. Industrious, law-abiding, and who therefore make good and sat'.? neighbors and citiaons. Reward or punish the individual on his merits as an individual. Kvil will surely come In t)»' both luces U' we sub stitute for this just rule the habit of treating all the member of the race, good and bad, alike. There is no question of "social equality" or "negro domination" involved only the question of relentlessly punishing bad men, and of securing to the good man the right to his life, his liberty, and the pursuit of his happiness as his own qualities of heart, head and hand cn able him to achieve it. Every colored man should realize that the worst enemy of his race Is the negro criminal, and above all the negro criminal who commits the dreadful crime of rape and it should be felt as In the highest de gre an offense against the whole country, and against the colored race In particular, for a colored man to fall to help the offi cers of the law in hunting down with all possible earnestness and zeal every such infamous offender. Moreover, in my judgment, the crime of rape should always be punished with death, as Is the case with murder: assault with intent to commit rape should be made a capital crime, at least In the discretion of the court and provision should be made by which the punishment may follow im mediately upon the heels of the offense: while the trial should be so conducted that the victim need not bo wantonly shamed while giving testimony, and that the least possible publicity shall bo given to the de tails. The members of the white lace on the other hand should understand that every lynching represents by just so much a. loosening of the bands of civilization that the splrit of lynching inevitably throws into prominence in the community all the foul and evil creatures who dwell therein. No man can take part in the torture of a human being without having his own moral nature permanently lowered. Every lynching means just so much moral de terioration In all the children who have an: knowledge of it. and therefore just so much additional trouble for the next gen eration of Americans. Let justice be both sure and swift: but let it be justice under the law. and not the wild and crooked savagery of a mob. As to the Schools. The free public school, the chance for each boy or girl to get a good elementary education, lies at the foundation of our whole political situation. In every com munity the poorest citizens, those who need the schools most, would be deprived of them if they only received school fa cilities proportioned to the taxes they paid. This is as true of one portion of our cotintry as of another. It is as true for the negro as for the white man. .The white man, if he is wise, will de cline to allow the negroes in a mass to grow to manhood and womanhood with out education. Unquestionably educa tion such as is obtained in our public schools does not do everything towards making a man a good citizen but it does much. The lowest and most brutal crim inals, those for instance who commit the crime of rape, are in the great majority men who have had either no education or very little just as they are almost Invariably men who own no property for thfe man who puts money by out of his earnings, like the man who acquires education, is usually lifted above mere brutal criminality. Of course, the best type of education for the c61ored man, taken as a whole, is such education as is conferred in schools like Hampton and Tuskegee where the boys and girls, the young men and young women, are trained indus trially as well as in the ordinarv pub lic school branches. The graduates of these schools turn out well in the great majority of cases, and hardly any of them become criminals, while what little criminality there is never takes the form of that brutal violence which invites lynch law. Capital and Labor. In dealing with both labor and capital with the questions affecting both corpo rations and trades unions, there is one matter more important to remember than aught else, and that is the Infinite harm done by preachers of mere discontent. These are the men who seek to excite a violent class hatred against all men of wealth. They seek to turn wise and proper movements for the better control ot corporations and for doing away with the abuses connected with wealth 'into a campaign of hysterical extitement and falsehood in which the aim is to inflame to madness the brutal passions of man Kind. The sinister demagogues and foolish vis ional- Jes who are always eager to un dertake such a campaign of destruction sometimes seek to associate themselves with those working for a genuine reform governmental and social methods, and sometimes masquerade as such reform ers. In reality they are the worst enemies of the cause they profess to advocate, i13' Purveyors of sensational slander in 'newspaper or magazine are the worst enemies of all men who are engaged in an honest effort to better what is bad in our social and govern mental conditions. fo preach hatred of Lhe rich man as such, to carry on a campaign of slander and invective against him, to seek to mislead and inflame to madness honest men whose lives are hard and who have not tne kind of menial training which will permit them to appreciate the dan ger In the doctrines preached—ail this is to commit a crime against the bodv politic and to be false to every worthv principle and tradition of American na tional life. Moreover, while such prcaching and such agitation may give a livelihood and a certain notoriety to some of those who take part in It, and may result in the temporary political success of others, in the long run every such movement will either fail or else will provoke a violent rc-ction. which will itself result not merely in undoing the mischief wrought by tne demagogue" and the agitator, but also In undoing the good that the honest reformer, the true upholder of popular rights, has painfully and laboriously achieved. Corruption Is never so rife as in com munities where the demagogue and the agitator bear full sway, because in such communities all moral bands become loosened, and hysteria and sensationalism replace the spirit of sound judgment and fair dealing as between man and man. The plain people who thli,k the me chanics, farmers, merchants, workers with head or hand, the men to whom American traditions are dear, who love their country and try to act decently by their neighbors, owe it to themselves to remember that the most damaging blow that can be given popular government is to elect an unworthy and sinister agitator on a platform of violence and hypocrisy Whenever such an issue is raised in this country nothing can be gained by flinching from it, for in such /*asc democ racy is itself on trial, popular self gov ernment under republican forms is itself on trial. The triumph c.f the mob is just as evil a thing as the triumph of the plutocracy, aiKl to have escapod one danger avails nothing whatever if we succumb to the other. Railroad Employes. I call your attention to the need if passing the bill limiting the number of hours of employment of railroad em oyes. The measure is a very moderate one and I can conceive of no serious ob jection to it. Indeed, so far as it is in our power, it should be our aim steadily to reduce the number of hours of labor with as a goal the general Introduction of an cigh-hour duv. Child-Woman Labor. Congress at its last session wiselv pro i-.led for a truant cmii for the District of Columbia, a maiked step in advance "ii the path of properly caring tor the children. Let me again urge that the congi ess provide for a thorough investi gation ot the conditions of child labor and of tne labor of women In the United States. The horrors incident to the emplovment of young chi.dren in factories or at work anywhere arc a blot on our civilization It is true that each state must ultimate ly sottie the question in its own wav but a thorough ofticial investigation of the matter, with the results published broadcast, would greatly help toward arousing tne public conscience ind secur ing unity of state action In the matter Among me excellent laws which the congress passed at the last session wis an employers' liability law. It wt'« a marked stop in advance uet the 1" ••!... nition of emp.oyers- liability on the i-l ute books: but the law did nor go fur f- rtf 1 il tMlnnn III! enough. In" spite of ail precautions sv. agitation is well founded Th 0vel 7 U','° of Labor Disputes. The commission appointed by the presi The exercise of a judicial spirit by a dis interested body representing the "federal government, such as would be provided by a commission on concilation and arbi tration would tend to create an atmos phere of friendliness and concilation be tween contending parties: and the giving each side an equal opportunity to present fully its case in the presence of the other would prevent many disputes from de veloping into serious strikes or lockouts, and, in other cases, would enable the com mission to persuade the opposing parties to come to terms. In this age of great corporate and labor combinations, neither employers nor em ployes should be left completely at the mercy o£ the stronger party to a dispute, regardless of the righteousness of their respective claims. The proposed measure would be in the line of securing recogni tion of the fact that in many strikes the public has itself an interest which can not wisely be disregarded an interest not merely of general convenience, for th« question of a just and proper public policy must also be considered. Coal Land Withdrawal. It is not wise that the nation should alienate its remaining coal lands. I have temporarily withdrawn from settlement all the lands which the geological survey has indicated as containing, or in all prob ability containing, coal. The question, however, can be properly settled only by legislation, which in my judgment should provide for the withdrawal of these lands from pale or from entry, save in certain especial circumstances. The ownership would then remain in the United States, which should r.ot, however, attempt to work them, but permit them to be worked by private individuals under a royalty system, the government keeping such con trol as to permit it to see that no exces sive price was charged consumers. It would, of course, be as necessary to supervise the rates charged by the com mon carriers to transport the'product aa the rates charged by those who mine it: and tho supervision must extend to the conduct of the common carriers, so that they shall in no way favor one competitor at the expense of another. The with drawal of these coal lands would consti tute a policy analogous to that which has been followed in withdrawing tlw forest lands, from ordinary settlement. The coal, like the forest, should be treated as the property cf the public and Its disposal should be under conditions which would Inure to the benefit o" the public as a whole. The passage of the railway rate bill, and only to a loss degree tho passage of the pure food bill, and the provision for in creasing and rendering more effective na tional control over the beef-packing in dustry, mark an important advance in the proper direction. In the short session it will perhaps bo difficult to do much further along this line: and it may be best to wait until the laws have been in operation for a number of months before endeavoring to increase their scope. During the last five months the rail roads have shown increased earnings and some of them unusual dividends: while during the same period the mere taking effect of the law has produced an unpre cedented, a hitherto unheard of, number I of voluntary reductions in freights and fares by the railroads. Since the founding of the commission there has never been a time of equal length in which anything like so rrany reduced tariffs have been put into effect. On August 27, for Instance, two days before the new law went into effect, the commission received notices of over 5.000 separate tariffs which represent ed reductions from previous rates. It must not be supposed, however, that with the passage of these laws it will be possible to stop progress along the line of increasing the power of the national gov ernment ever the use of capital in Inter state commerce. For example, there will ultimately be need of enlarging the pow ers of the interstate commerce commis sion along several different lines, so as to give it a larger and more efficient control over the railroads. It can not too often be repeated that experience has conclusively shown the im possibility of securing by tho actions of nearly half a hundred different state legis latures anything but ineffective chaos in the way of dealing with the great corpor ations which do not operate exclusively within the limits of any one state In some method, whether bv a national license law or in oilier fashion, we mu-st exercise, and that at an early date a far more complete control than at present over thesvf great corporations—a control that will among other things prevent the eviis of excessive overcapitalization and that will compel the disclosure bv each big corporation of its stockholders and of Its properties and business, whether own- ed directly 01- thiough subsidiary or affi- I hated corporation 1 viduals at the expense whether of the gen oral public, the stockholders, or the wage workers. Our effort should be not so much to prevent consolidation as such, but so to .supervise and control it as to see that ic results in no harm to the people The reactionary or ultraconservative apolo gists for the misuse of wealth assail the effort to secure such control as a s'o to ward socialism. Aj! a matter of fact It is these reactionaries and ultraconservatives who are themselves most potent In in creasing socialistic feeling. One of tho most ciiieient methods of averting the consequences ot a dangerous aeitatlon which Is SO per cent, wrong, is to remedy tlie ^O per cent, of evil as to wMch the 0 oc3t way erclsed bv employers thoro «r?. ur.Avoia- to AVrrt the very undesirable movn able aecU'.onu and even deaths Involved the government ownership ot rathvnva" is W lfri n_» i,« TKIa 1 »t 1i\I.A i.m I with ihri mechanic .-iris. This inevitable sacrifice of life may bo reduced to a minimum, but cannot be completely eliminated. It la a great social injus tice to compel the employe, or rather tho family of the killed or disabled victim, to beat- the entire burden of such nil inevitable sacrifice. In other words, so ciety shirks its duty by laying the whole eosi on the victim, whereas tho injury comes from what may he called the !r ri timatf risKs of the trade. Compensation for accidents 01- deaths duo in any line of industry to the actual conditions un d«r which that Industry Is carried on, should be ,yaid v»y that portion of the community for the benefit of which the industry is curried on—that is, by those who profit by tho industry. If the en tiro trnde risk Is placed upon the em ployer he will promptly and properly add it to the legitimate cost of production and assess it proportionately upon the con sumers of his commodity. It is therefore clear to my mind that tho law should place, this entire "risk of a trade" upon tho employer. Neither the federal law, nor, as far as I am informed, the state laws dealing with the question of em ployers' liability are sufficiently thor oughgoing. The federal law should o? course include omployes in navy yards, arsenals and the like. dent Octo™rr ^at th^rSM: of I Th'i^aetual Records show that during tho twenty years from January 1. 1SS1, to December 31, 1900, there were strikes affecting 117, 509 establishments, and 0,105,691 employes were thrown out of employment. During the same period there were 1,005 lockouts, involving nearly 10,000 establishments, throwing over 1,000,000 people out of em ijioyment. Many of these strikes and lockouts would not have occurred had tho parties to the dispute been required to appear be fore an unprejudiced body representing the nation, face to face, state the reasons for their contention. In most instances the dispute would doubtless be found to be due to a misunderstanding by each of the other's rights, aggravated by an unwillingness of either party to accept as true the statements of tho other as to the justice or injustice of tho matters in dis pute. eonneetod to secure by tho gov^rnm.'tu on behalf of a Corporations. ,j Tho present congress has taken long strides in the direction of securing proper supervision and control by the national government over corporations engaged in interstate business— and the enormous majority of corporations of any size are engaged in interstate business. 1 •1 his will tend to put a stop to the secur- ertheless" in "my ud ni en l" he "v hoi mies ng ot inordinate proilts by favored Indi- t-°u of marriage and divorce "hot _.:e pcoplo us a whole audi adequate con trol and regulation of the great interstate common carriers as will do away with tho v'vl.s which give rlso to tlio agitation against them. So the proper antidote to the dangerous and wicked agitation against the men of wealth as such is to secure by proper leg islation and executive action tlie abolition of the grave- abuses which actually do ob tain in connection with the. business uso of wealth under our present system—or rather no system—of failure to exercise any adequate control at all. Tho reactionaries and the violent ex tremists show symptoms of joining hands against us. Hoth assert, for instance, that if logical, we should go to government ownership of railroads and the like tho reactionaries, because on such an issue they think tho people would stand with them, while the extremists care rather to preach discontent and agitation than to achieve solid results. As a matter of fact, our position is as remote from that of tho bourbon reaction ary as from that of tho impracticable or sinister visionary. We ho tit- that the gov ernment should not conduct the business of tho nation, but that it should exereiso such supervision as will insure its being conducted in the intei'est of tho nation. Our aim is, so far as may be, to secure, for all decent, hard working men, equality 1 both the anthracite coal operators and 11,. n,. ,1-^!.V .„ „. ope miners, to inquire into, consider and pass upon the questions in controversy in con nection with the strike in the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania and the causes out of which the controversy arose, in their report, findings and award ex pressed the belief "that the state and federal governments should provide the machinery for what may bo called tho compulsory Investigation of controversies between employers and employes when they arise." This expression of belief is deserving of the favorable consideration of the congress and tho enactment of its provisions Into law. A bill has already been Introduced to this end. o°ur^"'h What we need is not vainly to try to prevent all combination, but to securesuch rigorous and adequate control and super vision of tho combinations as to prevent their injuring the public. I Two Taxes. Agricultural. The only other persons whose welfare is as v.tal to the welfare of the whole coun try as is the welfare of the wageworkers are the tillers of the soil, the farmers It Is a mere truism to say that no growth of cities, no growth of wealth, no industrial development can atone for any falling off In the character and standing of the farm ing population. Durirtg the last few dec ades this fact has been recognized with pver-.ncreasing clearness. There is 110 longer any failure to realize that farming at least in certain branches, must become a. technical and scientific profession. This means that there must be open to farmers the .chance for technical and scientific training, not theoretical merely but of the most severely practical type. The farmer represents a peculiarly high type of Amer ican citizenship, and he must have the same chance to rise and develop as other American citizens have. Irrigation. ..as shown that the effort to prohibit all com bination, good or bad, is noxious where it is not ineffective. Combination of cap ital like combination of labor Is a neces sary element of our present industrial system. It is not possible completely to prevent it and if it were possible, such complete prevention would do damage to the body politic. The question of taxation is difficult in any country, but it is especially difficult in ours with its federal system of govern ment. Some taxes should'on every ground be levied in a small district for use in that district. Thus the taxation of real estate is peculiarly one for the immediate local ity in which tho real estate Is found. Again, there is 110 more legitimate tax for any state than a tax on the franchises conferred by that state upon street rail roads and similar corporations which op erate wholly within tho state boundaries, sometimes in one amKsometimes in several municipalities or other minor divisions of the state. But there are many kinds of taxes which can only be levied by the general govern ment so as to produce the best results, because, among other reasons, the at tempt to impose them in one particular state too often results merely in driving the corporation or individual affected to some other locality or other state. The national government has long de rived its chief revenue from a tariff on imports and from an internal or excise tax. In addition to these there is every reason why, when next our system of tax- ti°n is revised, the national government should impose a graduated inheritance tax, and, if possible, a graduated income tax. The man of great wealth owes a pecu liar obligation to the state, because he de rives special advantages from the mere existence of government. Not only should he recognize this obligation in the way he leads his daily life and in the way he earns and spends his money, but it should also be recognized by the way in which ho pays for the protection the state gives him. On the one hand, it is desirable that he should assume his full and proper share of the burcien of taxation on the other hand, it is quite as necessary that in this kind of taxation, where the men who vote the tax pay but little of it, there should bo clear recognition of the danger of in augurating any such system save in a spirit of entire justice and moderation. Exactly how far the inheritance tax would, as an incident, have the effect of limiting the transmission by devise or gift of tho enormous fortunes in question it is not necessary at present to discuss. It is wise that progress in this direction should be gradual. At first a permanent national inheritance tax, while it might be more substantial than any such tax has hitherto been, need °t approximate, either in amount or in the extent of the increase by graduation, to what such a tax should ultimately be. On Different Footing. In its incidents, and apart from the main purpose of raising revenue an in come tax stands on an entirely different footing from an inheritance tax because it involves 110 question of the perpetua tion of fortunes swollen to an unhealthy size. The question is in its essence a question of the proper adjustment of bur dens to benefits. As the law now stands it is undoubtedly difficult to devise a na tional income tax which shall be consti tutional. Lut whether it is absolutely im possible is another question and if pos sible it is most certainly desirable. The first purely income-tax law was passed by the congress in 1SG1, but the most import ant law dealing with the subject was that of, 1&!M. This the court hold to be uncon stitutional. The question is undoubtedly verv intri cate, delicate, and troublesome. The de cision of the court was only reached by ono majority. It is the law of the land and of course is accepted as such and loyally obeyed by all good citizens. Never theless, the hesitation evidently felt by the court as a whole in coming to a con clusion, when considered together with the previous decisions on the subject may perhaps indicate the possibility of devising a constitutional income-tax law which shall substantially accomplish the results aimed at. The difficulty of amending the constitution is so great that only real necessity can justifv a resort thereto. Every effort should be made in dealing with this subject, as with the subject of the proper control by the national government over tho use of cor porate wealth in interstate business to devise legislation which without such ac t}on shall attain the desired end but if this fails, there will ultimately be no al ternative to a constitutional amendment now being done for the states of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains through the development of the national policy of irrigation and forest preserva tion no government policy for the hetter ment of our internal conditions has been more fruitful of good than this. The for- 1 Wh:t0 mountains and Southern Appalachian regions should also be pre rcr\ed, and they cannot be unless the peo ple of the states in which they lie, through their representatives in the congress cure vigorous action by The national 'gov ernment. b... .... Marriage-Divorce. I am well aware ot how difficult it 's to pass a constitutional amendment vorce should be relegated to the authority of the national congress. At pi (sent the wide differences In the laws in tile d.ffereiit states on this subject, result in scandals and abuses surely there is nothing so vitallv es^-n tial to the welfare of the nation, nothinir around which the nation should so bend itself to thiow every safeguard, us the homo life of the average citizen. The change would be good from every stand point. In particular it would be good be cause it would conlcr on the congress the power at once to deal radically and 5ciently with polygamy an this should oe done wht-iher or not marriage and di irorco are dealt with. It is neither safe nor jnonei to lease the question ot poivgamv to dealt with by tho several iutea. I'ovver to deal with It nhonld be vonterred on t!.i national government. When home tit.-tj are loosened when ir.en and women eeaso to regard a won In- fam ily life, with all Its .luties fully i.-sed, and all its responsibilities lived up to. as tho 1110 best worth living then -vil days tor tho coiniiionw.'itii! -,i h:ind. Tho Subsidy Issue. T.et me 01100 again call the attention of the congress to two subjects eniuerning which 1 Jiave frequently beltiro communi cated \yith them. One Is the o.uestlou of developing American shipping. 1 trust that a law embodying In substance the views, or a major part of the views, ex pressed in the report on this i.ubioet laid be lore tho house at its last session will be passed. 1 am well aware that in former years objectionable measures have bi en proposed in reference to tho encourage ment of American shipping but it seems to mo that the proposed measure Is as nearly unobjectionable an any can be. It will of course benetit primarily our sea board ^states, such as Maine, Louisiana and Washington but what benefits part of our people In the end benefits ail just as government aid to Irrigation and for estry in tho west is really of benetit, not only to tho ltocky mountain states, but to all our country. If it prove impractic able to cnact a law for the encouragement of shipping generally, then at IcasL provi sion should be made for better communi cation with South America, notably for fast mail lines to the chief South Ameri can ports. It is discreditable to us that our business people, for lack of direct communication in the shape of lines of steamers with South America, should in that great sister continent be at a disad vantage compared to the business people ol turope. Currency Reform. I especially call your attention to the second subject, the condition of our cur rency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.-11 to ?33.0S. For several years eVKlence has been accumulating th.i'c ad ditional legislation is needed. The re currence of each crop season emphasizes the defects of tho present laws. There must soon be a revision of them, be cause to leave them as they are means to incur liability of business disaster. Since your body adjourned there has 1" eti a fluctuation in tho interest on eaii money from 2 per cent, to per cent. and the fluctuation was even greater during tile preceding six months. The secretary of the treasure had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is the advance in commercial rates and the un certainty felt In the sufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial in terests suffer during eacli crop period. Kxeessive rates for call money in New York attract money from the interior banks into the speculative field: this de pletes the fund that would otherwise be available for commercial uses, and com mercial borrowers are forced to pay ab normal rates: so that ea-h fall a tax, in tho shape of increased interest charges, is placed on tho whole commerce of the country. Tho mere statement of these facts shows that our present system is seri ously defective. There is need of a change. Unfortunately, however, manv of the proposed changes must be ruled from consideration because they are compli cated, are not easy of comprehension, and tend to disturb existing rights and interests. We must also rule out anv plan which would materiallv impair the value of the United States 2 tier cent, bonds now pledged to secure circulation, foe issue of which was made under con ditions peculiarly creditable to the treas ury. I do not press any especial plan, various plans have recently been pro posed by expert committees of bankers. Among the plans which are possible feasible and which certainlv should re ccive your consideration is that repeat edly brought to your attention by the present secretary of the treasury", the essential features of which have' been approved by many prominent bankers and business men. According to this pian national banks should be permitted to ss "e a specified proportion of their ca-o ital in notes of a given kind, the issue to be taxed at so high a rate as to drive the notes back when not wanted in 

ICKI timat'i trade. This plan would not prT mit tho issue of currency to give banks additional profits, but to meet the emer gency presented by times of stringency. To Prevent Spasms. I do riot say that this is the rip,hi system. I only advance It to emphasize my belief that there is need for the adop tion of some system which shall bo au tomatic and open to all sound banks, so as to avoid all possibility of discrim ination and favoritism. Such a plan would tend to prevent the spasms of high money and speculation which now obtain in the New York market for at present there is too much currency at certain seasons of the year, and Its ac cumulation at New York tempts bankers to lend it at low- rates for speculative purposes whereas at other times when the crops are being moved there 5s urgent need for a largo but temporary increase in the currency supply. It must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally quite as much as bankers especially is this truo of stockmen, farmers and busi ness men in the west for a.t present at certain seasons of the year the difference in interest rates between the east and the west is from to 10 per cent., where as in Canada the corresponding difference is but 2 per cent. Any plan must, of cotirse, guard the interests of western and southern bankers as Carefully a= it guards the interests of New York or Chi cago bankers and must bo drawn from the standpoints of the farmer and the merchant no less than from tho stand points of the city banker and the country banker. The law should be amended so as spe cifically to provide that tho funds derived from customs duties may be treated bv the secretary of the treasury as I10 trials funds obtained under the internal rev enue laws. There should bo a consid erable increase in bills of small denomi nations. Permission should bo given banks, if necessary under settled re strictions, to retir 'their circulation to a larger amoupt than $3,000,000 a month. Philippine Tariff. I most earnestly hope that the bill to provide a lower tariff for or else absolute free trade in Philippine products will be come a law. No harm will come to anv American industry and while there wiil be some small but real material benefit to the Filipinos, the main benefit will come by the showing made as to our pur pose to do all in our power for tlie'.r welfare. So far our action in the Phil ippines has been abundantly justified, not mainly and indeed not primarily be cause of the added dignity it has given us as a nation by proving that we are capable honorably and efficiently to bear the international burdens which a mighty people should bear, but even more be cause of the immense benefit that has come to the people of the Philippine, islands. In these islands we are steadily intro ducing both liberty and order, to a great er degree than their people have ever before known. We have secured justice. We have provided an efficient police force, and have put down ladronism. Only in the islands of Leyto and Samar is. the authority of our government resisted and this by wild mountain tribes under the superstitious inspiration of fakirs and pseudo-religious leaders. We are constantly Increasing the meas ure of liberty accorded the islanders, and next spring, if conditions warrant, we shall take a great stride forward in test ing their capacity for seif government by summoning the first Filipino legisla tive assembly and the wav 111 which tliev stand this test wi largelv determine whether the self government thus grant ed will be mcrcascd or decreased: for if we have erred ac all in the Philippines it has been proceeding too rapidlv in tho direction of granting a large measure of self government. We are building roads. We have, for the immeasurable good of the people, arranged for the building cf railroads. Lot 113 also =ee to it that they are given free access our markets. This nation owes no mot imperative duty to itseit and mankind than the dutv of of all the Islands under the American Porto Rico. American citizenship should be con ferred on the citizens of Porto Rico Tl'o harbor of San Juan In Porto Rico should be dredged ar.d imwovod. The expense" af tho federal court of Porto Rico should be met from the federal treasury. Tha administration of the affairs of I'orto Itleo, together with those of the Philip pines. llawaii and our otlur insular poM sessli.ns, should till be directed under ono executive department by preference thu dep.-ii-tuent ur" state or tliu department of war. International Morality. It Is ml« «k, and It betrays a spirit of foolish cynicism, to maintain that all Interna:lonai go\crumcntill action Is, and must ever In-, based upon mere j-olllsh nc.ss, ami (hat tu advance ethical reasons tor such action is always a sign of hypoc risy. Tills is no more necessarily truo of the action of governments than of tha action of individuals. 1 is a sure sign of a ba.su nature always to aseribu baso motives for tlie actions of others. Unquestionably no nation can afford to disregard proper considerations of self Itk terest, any more than a private individ ual can so do. llut it is equally true thai the average private individual In any really decent community does many ac tions with reference to other men In which he Is guided, not by self Interest, but by public spirit, by regard for the rights of others, by a disinterested pur pose to do good to others, and to rulsa the tone of tin community as a wholo. Similarly, a really great nation must often act, and as a matter of fact often does act, toward other nations I11 a spirit not in the least of mere self interest, but paying heed chietly to ethical rea sons and as the centuries go by this dis interestedness in international action, this tendency of the individuals compris ing a nation to require that nation to act with justice toward its neighbors, steadily grows and strengthens. It la neither wise nor right lor a nation to disregard its own needs, and it is fool ish— and may be wicked—-to think that other nations will disregard theirs. Hut It Is wicked for a nation only to regard lis own interest, and foolish to believa that such is the soie motive that actu ates any other nation. It should be our steady aim to ralso the ethical standard of national action .lust as we strive to raise tlie ethical standard of individual action. Not only must we treat all nations fairly, but we must treat with justice and good will all Immigrants who conn here under tile law. V/hcfhov they ara Catholic or l'rotestant, Jew or (lentile whether they come from i'.ngland or Ger many, Hussia, Japan, or Italy, matters 110thing. All we have a right to question is tin man's conduct, if he is honest and upright in his dealings with his neigh bor and with the st ue, then he is en titled to rerpeet and good treatment, l-.specially do we need to remember our duty to tlie stranger within our gates. It is the sure mark of a low civilization, a low morality, to abuse or discriminate ug.-Mnst or in any way humiliate such stranger who has come hero lawfully and v,-ho is conducting himself properly. Tcs remember tiiis is incumbent 011 every American citizen, and is of course pe culiarly incumbent 0:1 every government ol'lii iai, whether of the nation or of tha several states. Japan as a Friend. I am prompted to say this by the at t.Hide cf hostility here and there assumed Japanese in tb.ls countrv. 11ns hostility is sporadic and is limited to a very fe\v places. Nevertheless, it la most discreditable to us as a people, and it may be fraught with the gravest con sequences to the nation. Tlie friendship between the United States an.I Japan litis been continuous since tile time, over half a cetiturv ago, when Commodore Perry, bv his expedi tion to Japan, tiivt opened the islands to western civilization. She lias pro duced great generals and might ad m.'rals: her lighting men, afloat and a shore, show- all the heroic courage, th« unquestioning, unfaltering loyalty, the spieudid indifference to hardship and death, which marked the l.oyal Koninst ai:d they show slso that they possess tha '.ghost ideal of patriotism. Japanese arnsts of every kind see their prouuets eagerly sought for in all lands The in dustrial and commercial development o» Japan has been phenomenal: greater than that of any other country during the same period. Our nation fronts on tho Paeilie, -fust as it ftoiits on tho Atlantic. We hope to play a constantly growinsr part in the great ocean of the orient. We wish, aa we ought to wish, for a great eomraer cinl development in our dealings with Asia: and, it is out of the question that we snoulu p'-rmanently have such de. velopmerit unless we free!'.- and gl-idlv extend to other nations the same measurs ot justice and good treatment which ws expect to receive in return i: is only a very small body of out citizen3 that act: badly. I recommend to congress that an act oe passed specifically providing for the naturalization of Japanese who come liert intending to become. American citizens. Cuba's Paragraph. I take tiiis oi'i'ortunity of exprcssnuj upon behalf of the American people, witi all possible solemnity, our most earnest hope that the people of Cuba will re iilz« the imperative need of ereserviusr ju*t!c« and keeping order i:i the island. Th» I nitcd States wishes nothing ot Cuba .• cept that it. shall prosper morally and ma tnaliy. and wishes nothing of the Cubans save that they shall be able to pres-erv* order among themselves anil therefore to preserve tlv ir independence. Il tho c]et tions become a farce, and if the insurrec t.onary habit becomes confirmed in th« island, it is absolutely out of the question tnat the island should continue independ ent and the United State.-, which has as sumed the sponsorship bei'cre tlie. eivilii-ed world for Cuba's career as a nation, would again have to intervene and to see thai U,-,.UI1 I.VI 1IHI 1 ed in the the government was derly fashion as to secure life and property. •such or. xtety ol War Imperative. By the special and hlghlv appreciated courtesy of the government of Russia arid the Netherlands, a proposal to call The Hague conference together at a timt which would conflict, with tho conference 01' tho American republics at Rio de Jan eiro in August was laid aside. No othei date has yet been suggested. A tentative program for tho conference has been pro posed by the government of Russ'a, and the subjects which it enumerates are un dergoing careful examination and consid eration in preparation for the conference. It must over be kept in mind that war is not merely justifiable, but imperative, upon honorable men, upon an honorable nation, where peace can only be obtained by tho sacrifice of conscientious convic tion or of national welfare. Peace is normally a great good, and nor mally it coincides with righteousness but it is righteousness and not peace which should bind the conscience of a nation as it should bind the conscience of an Individ ual and neither a nation rior an individual can surrender conscience to another's keeping. Neither can a nation, which la an entity, and which does not die as in dividuals die, refrain from taking thought for the interest of the generations that are to come, no less than for the interests of tho feneration of to nay a.nrl no public men have a right whether from shortsightedness, from sel-i liesh indifference, or from sentimentality.^' to sacrifice national interests which nr«t vital in character. A just war Is in the long run far better for a nation's sou? than the most prosperous peace obtained by acquiescence in wrong or injustice. Moreover, though it is criminal for a na tion.not to prepare for war, so that it may'. escape the dreadful consequences of be ing defeated in war, yet it must alwavs bat remembered that -even to be defeated It* war, may be far better than not to have! fought at all. As has been well and finely! said. a. beaten nation is not necessarily ai disgraced nation: but the nation or mail is disgraced if the obligation to defend right is shirked. We should as a nation do everything in cur power for tho cause of honorable' peace. It is morally as indefensible for a nation to commit a wrong upon another nation, strong or weak, as for an Individ-4* ual thus to" wrong his fellows. Yfe should' do all in our power to hasten the dav when", there shall be peace among the nations—i a. peace based upon justice and not upon' cowardly submission to wrong.
