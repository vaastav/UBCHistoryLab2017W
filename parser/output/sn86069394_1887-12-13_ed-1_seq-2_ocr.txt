GENERAL NEWS. The Kcpublicau National Commit tee met in Washington last week and after a good deal of ballotting bet ween Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Omaha, Minneapolis, St. Louis and Chicago, dually settled upon Chicago as the place lor holding the Presidential convention.

Did girls got from childhood the samo business training as boys, ami wore it clearly understood In all fami lies that it is not a credit but a dis credit for womon to bo idle, to hang holpless on tlio men instead of doing their own work and, 11 necessary earning their own living. I believe so ciety would be not tho worse, but the better, for tlio change. Men would find out that tho more they clevato womon tho greater use they got out of them. If, instead of a man working himself to tlcitli tr his unmarried daughters and then leaving them lg nominiously dependent upon male re lntlons. he educated them to inde pendence, made them nolo both to maintain and protect themselves, it would savo him and them a world ot uuhappincss.

Some interesting experiments on the effects of heating oh '.ho slrongtb and ductility of metals used for machines and structure wero recently mado at the Rival dockyard, Portsmouth, England. All bronzes showed a reg ular, but not serious, decrease of strength and ductility up to a certain point which is between three and four hundred degrees for ordinary gun metals beyond which the strength suddenly drops to about one-half, and tho ductility vanishes. Phosphor- bronze preserves two-thirds cf it strength and one-third of its ductility np lo live hundred degrees Fahrenheit; and Muntz metal and pure copper aro also fairly satisfactory in those re spects. . Wrought iron gains in strongfh up to five hundred degrees; but loses in ductility up to three hun. drcd degrees after which it gains. Ooen-bcarth steel is not affected in strength by a temperature of five hun dred degrocs. but its ductility is re- ducod one-half. Arkantaw Iravtler.
