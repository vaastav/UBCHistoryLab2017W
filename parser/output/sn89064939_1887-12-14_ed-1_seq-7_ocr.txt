JAMES G. BLAINE, Tfce American Statesman, Now in Taris, Sharply Critic! the Message of Mr. Cleveland. s NEW YORK, Bee 7.Tho Tribune of to morrow v.'ill CODtain along interview with Hon. James G. Blaine in Parns on President Cleveland's message. It is as follows "I have been-reading an abstractor the president's message ai have been especially in terested in the comments of the London papers. Those papers all assume to decl'ire the message fa a tree trade manifesto and evidently are antic ipating an enlarged market for Engish fabrics in the "United States as a consequence of the president's recommendations. Perhaps that fact stamped the character of the message more "cleV-ly than any words of mine can." Ton don't mean actual free trade without duty?" qneried the reporter. "No," replied Mr. Blaine. "Nor do the London papers mean that. ^They simply mean that the president has recommended what in the United States is known aa a revenne tariff, rejecting the 'Protective feature as an object, and not even per mittine protection toresult freely as an incident to revenue duties. For the first time ia the his tory of tbeUnited States thepresident recom mends retaining the internal tax in order that the tariff may be forced down even below the fair revenne standard. He recommends that the tax on tobacco be retained, and thus that many millions annually shall be levied on a do mestic product which would far better come fron\ a tariff on foreian fabrics. I should urge the ,repeai of the tobacco, tax an once, even before the Christmas holidays. It would in the first place bring great relief to cfowers of tobacco all over the country, and would, moreover, materi ally lessen the price of the article to consumers. Tobacco to millions of men is a necessity. The luxury of ye terday becomes a necessity to-day. The onlv excuse for sucu at is the a'ctuil ne cessity unrior which the government found itself durinir ihe war, and the years immediately fol lowing. Toretan the tax now in order to de stroy the protection which would incidentally flow from raiding the same amount of money on foreisrn imports, is certainly a most extraordi nary policy for our government. I would not advise the repeal of the whisky tax. Other con siderations than those of financial administra tion are to be takon into account with regard to whisky. There is A 

MOHAL SIDE TO IT. To cheapen the price of whiskv is to increase the consumption.enormouslv. There would be no sense in urging the reform wrought by high license in manv srates, if the national govern ment neutralizes the good effect bv making whisky within reach of every one at 20 cents a gallon. Whisky wonld be everywhere dis tilled if the surveillance of the government were withdrawn by the mission of the tax.a It would destroy hisrh Hoanse at once In all the SMites. Whi-ky has? done a vast, d-al of harm in the United S a es. I would try to make it do some good. 1 would use the tax to fortify our cities on the seaboard. In view of the powerful letter addressed to the Democratic party on the subject of fortification by Uhe late Samuel J. TUden in 1885,1 am amazed that no attention has been paid to the subject by the Democratic administration. So long as there is whisky to tax I would tax it, and when the na1654. tional government should have no use for the money I would divide the tax among the federal union with the specific object of lightening the tax on real estate. Tho houses and farms ot the whole country pav too large a prooor: ion of the total taxes. If nlti mately re lief could be eiven in that direction it would, in my judgment, be a wise and beneficent policy. Some honest, but moulded iriends of temper ance have ureed that toe government should not use the money derived from the tax on whisky. My reply is that the tox on whisky by the fed eral government,with its suppression of all illicit distillation and consequent enhancement of price, has been a powerful agent in tne temper ance reform' bv putting it beyond the reach of so many. The amount of whisky consumed in the United States per capita to-dav is not more tharilu per cent of that consumed thirty years agof Iu my judgment the whiskv tax Bhould b/j so modified as to permit all who use pure alcohol in mechanical pursuits to have it tree of tax. In all such eases the tax could be omitted without danger of fraud. I should seriously object to the repeal of the duty/on wool. To repea that would work great iustice to manv interests, and would seriously courage what we should earnestly encourage, ,mely, the shep culture smone farmers ironghout the Union. To break down wool rowin&and be dependent on foreign countries cor the olanket nnder which we sleep and the coat that covers our backs is not a wise policy for the national government to enforce." "Do you think if the president's recommenda tion were adopted it would 

INCREASE OUB EXPOET TBADE?" Possiblv in some few articles of pecnliar con struction it might, but it wonld increase our import trade ten-fold as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen and cotton goods. In iron, in steel, in all the thousand and one shapes in which they are wrought. How are we to ex port staple fabsics to the markets of Europe unless we make them cheaper than they do In Europe, and how are we to manufacture them cheaper than they do unless we ret cheaper labor than they ha in Europe? The question of labor underlies the whole subject. It is, in fact, the entire question. Whenever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every department to work as cheaply and live as poorly in the United States as sim lar workmen in Europe, we can, of course, manufacture just as cheaply as they do in Entrlind and France. But I am totally' OD- "d to a policy tnat would entail such results, ttempt it is equivalent to asocial aud fiuan* revolution, one that would bring untold dis- a. Th? moment you begin to import freely a Europe your drive our own workmen from hanical aad manufacturing pursuits. In the proportion they become tillers of the seiL ea&ing steadily the agricultural product and easing steadily the large home demand, ch is constantly enlarging as home manu urers enlarge. That, of course, works great iry to the farmer, glutting the market with products and tending constantly to lower ,es." ies, but the foreign demand for farm pi od would be ,increased in like ratio, would it Even suppose it were," said Mr. Blaine, "how you know the source from which it will be plied The tendency in Russia to-day and :he Asiatic possessions of England is toward arge increase of the grain supply, the grain ng raised by the cheapest possible labor. nuiaciuring countries will buy their bread iffs where they can get them cheapest, and enlarging of the home market for the Ameri farmer beiug checked he would search in in for one of the same value. His foreign ^Ba^ea are already checked by the great competU tion abroad. There never was a time .when the increase of a large home market was so valuable to him. The best proof is that tha farmers are .prosperous iu proportion to the nearness of manufacturing centers, and a protective tariff tends to spiead manutactures'" "But those holding the president's views," re marked the reporter, "are always quoting the great prosperity of the counirv under the tariff of 1840." "That tariff did not involve tho one destructive point recommended by the president, namely, tha retaining of direct internal' taxss in order to ahalish indirect taxes levied on.foreign fabrics. But the country had peculiar advantages under it by the Crimean war involving England, France and Russia and largely impairing their trade. All these incidents were immensely stimulating .to trade in thedistant United Siates, regardless of the nature of our tariff. But mark the end of this Eurotea .ex perieoce with the tariff of 18,46. Its enactment was immediately followed by the Mexicanvar then,in.1848 by the great convulfions of Europe then in 1849 ank succeeding tvears by thepold enormous gold yield in California. The powers made, peace in 1856. and at the same time the .output of fold in Calitornia fell off. Immedi ately the financial panio ot'186.7 came .upon the .country with disastrous force.

S^S^JA- ATONKMENT FOB OCB JBOJjjy. $kiM$M Is :remarkable that President Polk recom fnded the tariff.of 1846 on precisely the same ttmd that President Cleveland pecommends a Mar enactment now. nstmelv, the surplus in treasury was menacing i he prosperity of the mtry. History is repeating itself. Mr. insisted on emptying the treasury free trade tariff, then inanediatelv -_ ._~~ the country into debt by borrowing j|!f'LE&l50.00Q.GOO for the Mexican war. ISrun uothing may .occur to repeat so disastrous a se inul to the policy recommended bv Prestaen lleve&nd. But the uniform fate has been f" it: ty years past that the ftemocraiic party wheif 'Jgoes oet of power always leaves an empty Jjpssnnr* and when it returns *ver always finds a full treasury I would make here and there some changes ii. \tariff, not to reduce protection, but wisely srir. No great svstem of revenue like on can orerate with efflcipncr and equity un title change* of trade be closely watched and Haw promptly adapted lo these changes. would make no ononzo that would impair the protective character of the whole bodyo the tariff laws. The reporter repeated the question wheth er the president's recommendation would nos, if adopted, give us the advantage of a laigre increase in exports. "I only repeat," aaswered Mr. Blaine, "that it would vast:y enlarge our imports, while the only export it would seriously m creae would be, our gold and eilv r. That would flow out bounteous!v. just as it did under the tariff of 1846. The presidents recommendation enacted into law would result, as did an experiment in drainage of a .man who wished to turn a swamp into productive field. He dug a drain to a neighboring river, but it happened, unfortunately, that the level of the river was higher than the level of the swamp. The -consequence need not be told. A parallel would .be found when the president's, policy, in attempting to open a channel for an in rease of exports, should (-imply succeed in making way for a deluging inflow of fabrics to the destruc tion of home industry."' The New Postmaster Ceheral. Don. M. Dickinson was born at Port Ontario. Oswego county, N. Y., Jan. 17, 1846. His mother's ancestors came from Wales. When two years old he went to Detroit with his parents. passed through the common schools of the city, and alter a year's instruction und&r a pri vate tutor, ho entered the Michigan uni versity. When he graduated from the law department he returned to Detroit and immediately entered on the practice of the law. He mixed considerable politics with his business. In 1872 Mr. Dickinson was chairman pf the Democratic central com mittee and his enthusiasm and energy proved so acceptable to his party that at the opening of the campaign he was strong ly urged to resume the management, which he did. Hia labors were manifested in the result. Since that time Mr. Dickinson has been the recognized leader of the Michigan Democracy. He has given most liberally of his.time and money to bring the party to the front. Without being rich he has an ample fortune His tastes are literary, and with his friends he is genial and un pretentious. General News Notes. Maj. Gen. Alfred H. Terry, commanding general of this division, has been granted a four months' leave of absence. The gen eral has been troubled with Brighth's die ease for some time, and is about to take much needed rest from official responsi bilities. During the general's temporary absence the command of the divisio.n will very probably be exercised by Gen. Sheri dan, in Washington. Father Claver was canonized by the pope on the 5th. He was a distinguished Spanish missionary. He was born in 1-572, and died at Carthagena, South America, in Belabored many years among the slavos, and was known as the apostle of the negroes. J. M.

The secretary of the interior approved the assignment of the lease of James A. Clark tif his hotel site in Yellowstone Park to White, Prank and Letellier, of Grand Rapids. Mich.

Frank Klein, the chief of the gang of train robbers who went through a train near Little Rock four years ago, onFreeman's the Little Rock, Mississippi & Texas railroad, was arrested near Muskogee, Ind. Ter., by two Indian police and taken to Fort Smith.

Sadi-Carnot, president of France, in an interview with Clemenceau said: He was under no illusion that he had been chosen as president for his own merits. He had an earnest desire to do his duty and sink self on every occasion where his per sonal views might conflict with the pub lic interest. While admitting that there must always exist two great republicai parties, the president said, it wonld be possible in elections for them to unite against their common enemy, the Monarch ists. A New York dispatch says: The efforts on the part of those interested to form a boot and shoe triiRt, which has heretofore been unsuccessful by reason of the refusal of two companies to join in the plan, were successful. Preliminary agreements were drawn up, and it is asserted that the formal arrangements will be made. The companies represented are: The May er and New Jersey Rubber company of New Brunswick, the Boston Shoe (ompa ny, the Candee Rubber company of Bos ton, the Woonsocket Rubber company and the American Rubber company. I is understood that' operations under the trust will begin Jan. 1 At Thomasville, Ga The collapse of a water tower killed four men outright and caused serious injury to four others, one of whom cannot live. Two of the killed were T. P. Romerdell and Joseph Moore. Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, has astonished the Republican side of the Sen ate by selecting a choice seat on the Demo cratic side of the chamber. When his last term expired the Legislature did not re elect him in time for to take a seat at theboose, extra session when Cleveland was inaugu rated in 18S5, and Blair lost his seat. Ever since he has been lookingaround for a good one until he has finally landed in among the Democratic Senators. Thereis no sig nificance in thiB move, as thereis no divid ing line further than custom. Acting land commissioner Stoc^sTager says that the net of March 3, 1887, refers only to the original act. ^fe ^l?
