The members of the Military Committee are not loss positive In their assurances to the snrrto effect. Three members of that Committee, repre senting both political parties, said to-day that they haa no apprehensions what ever of any angry discussions between tho two Governments.

The Committee learn that the Rio (iron do Is A SHALLOW RIVER, not navigable a novo Fort Brown; that nine tieths oi tho Inhabitants on the Texas Itordcr arc .Mexicans; that tlm raiders arc nearly all In dians, with a tew outlaws and fugitives; that they make Incursions on our soil, rob and steal, and hide among the chapparci, or with the half-breeds, and that they did Dlls quite as much flUcen years ago as now.

The representative of tho Diaz Government here has been informed that tho Committee WILL HBAR HIM If ho desires, and ho has given notice that he will he present at the meeting to-morrow. The incmi>cr* of tho Foreign Affairs Committee have already heard Gen. Ord and some other army officers on Ihe *nbjcct of the possibility of International difficulties with Mexico.

This resolution wo* possod with great uoammUy, there being bnt three negative votes In (he Uouao of Representatives end one in the bensle, and he had no doubt that It expressed tho considerate and deliberate opinion of the people In that btate on (bo subject wltn the same unanimity as was evidenced br their representatives in tho passage of the resolution. He had been moved In part by that resolution to submit Uu one now be lore the Senate, ibungb bis resolution did not cover the whole ground. That of tho Üblo Assembly expressed the opinion Must such restoration of (be silver dollar was domsnded by true financial wisdom, and declared It would be in pursuance of the proper public policy to do so. It was nut his purpose now to discuss the prop osition as to what would oe expedient and politic lor the Government and people to do, uni what would be right to do. In his opinion it would be rlgnt for the Government to do so, and be used the word right Id It* legal, equitable, and noral sense. It ws* bis purpose 10-dav hrlelly to show that by (he teller and spirit of the law tbu Guvvroimmtbad the right to restore lhe silver dollar, and would be Justified Id doing so, and further to show that, outside of tho law, Using In view alt the clrcutu stances of tbu cose, every Incident of financial leg islation, the restoration of the dollar would nut bo a violation of the declaration of public honor, public Justice, or public equity. He then quoted from the act to strengthen tha public credit approved March lit, Ihdu, sud argued that the word • * cola " as asud In this act must not be Interpreted to refer to gold cum alone.

He anpied that all bonds, by their terms, by the plain and proper meaning of the words on them, were redeemable In coin* known to tho statntes of the Untied State* at the time each bonds wore au thorised. He then referred to tho specie Rcsnmp- Hop act of 187 fl. and stated that prior to the passage of that act. hut sub sequent to the act of 1870, to-wlt: hy the act of 1873, a now coinage was established which dropped from the list of authorised coins of tiio I nltcd States what had always been known to oor law n* the silver dollar. Now In law or In moral* what difference did that make? The United States a* uiueicnb, uni tuai aia«c. i no wimvu —• one of tho parties to a contract, could not of its own motion change a contract, therefore that act did not affect holders of bond*. The recital* contained In hi* preamble sod resolution logically and locally Justified the conclusion that It was necessary fur the OnveniMHil to retrace its slew*, and restore tno law a* it was prior to 1873, pat buck tho silver dollar a* It stood.# legal-tender for tho payment of all bonds,and. to do so would not be In violation of public faith, nor In dcro.mUon of the right* of pnblte creditors. The Government, In order to keep Itself in a position to perform tue contract according to it* letter and spirit, should restore the silver dollar ami keep U lust as it was, u full and complete legal-tender. Senators were not act ing for luemsclTes; they wero not dealing for their private or individual Interests: they were here aa representatives of a great pnono interest; they were here as trustee* of the nation, trustee* of It* honor ns well a* bf It pecuniary Interest, but bound to act a* trustees according to the universal- ly acknowledged principle* of right and law. \\ hat right hud Senators to giro away one particle of that great tm.»llc domain of power which consti tuted Urn public rfclitl They were the conserva tor* of It. The President of tbo United btstes could only speak for the people In the limited channel* marked oat for him by tho Constitution. When he (Mutilicwsi heard tho talk that it was the expectation of tho purchaser of tho bonds that bceanso he pnld gold for tbem he must receive gold, he asked who had given oat snch expecta tion. Where bad the people so spoken.—through what channel, through what agency? Lot tho record bo produced. There wero consideratlone of another nature which Invited discussion, and into which perhaps tho Senate ought to go, into which perhaps eomo who wonld take part in the discussion would nec essarily go. but he wonld only briefly refer to them. It had been said tnat silver had depredated in valnc. How was the loss measured? Uy gold. Why not say gold bad opprcclated in value? Mr. Eaton—Ua* not silver depreciated In tba purchase of every product? Mr. Matthew*—l answer silver can to-day bay more of every known product of labor than It could in July, ißTO.nore and In Asia. Nowhere in ihe world has silver depredated the breadth ofa hair. On the contrary, it hits maintained it* posi tion. It can buy to-day more land, more houses, more calico, more everything, than It could in 1870. Mr. Eaton said he agreed with the Senator that It could in America, cut It could not abroad. Mr. Matthews—What have wo to do with abroad? What have wo to do wtta the inquiry whether lunds and houses abroad have appreciated or not? W'ho I* there who docs not know from actual personal observation that evorytntng haa gone down, and that gold slooe ha* gone ul. Nothing could pre vent persons from seeing that but the blindness of those who had Joined the conspiracy to exalt gold as the king of money. Mr. Edmunds euid, taking tho remarks of tbo -Senator to ho true about silver and gold, wny would not bla philosophy apply as well to copper ami gold. Mr. Matthowa—Wo did not agree to pay in copper. Mr. Edmunds then asked if the Senator from Ohio woe quite sure cold had appreciated, and if the price of silks In France In gold was ao high as fire years ago. Mr. Matthews, resuming his argument, said be had the testimony of his own personal experience, tbo testimony of tho list of Iwmcmptcies tarough out the country, tbo testimony of tho list of sheriffs* sale*, to tho effect that everything but gold bad depreciated in value. What else meant all this cry of discontent? What else meant all this murmur of dissatisfaction? The distress of tbe country now was beyond oil historical com- | parlsoo in our country, and It would take nut a few i more turns of the wheel tu throw tbe great mass i of our people Hilo bankruptcy. i In conclusion Mr. Matthews argued that If tula appreciation of gold shall continue, the best in vestment possible would bo to lock It un and wait i Its appreciation. t Sir. Morrill said If the Senator from Ohio bad in- i troducud this resolution and asked its reference to i tbe Committee on tbe Judiciary, he might have i understood bis purpose. The question raised by i bis resolution was a legal one. Whenever tbe , main question came up as to tbe remonetisation of i silver bo (Morrill) would be prepared to express i his views upon it. and be boned to oe able to show < that It would bo cheaper and bolter for tbe United btatos to pay its debts in gold. . . The Senator rrom Ohio (Matthews) bad set out with the declaration that wo bad thu equitable ami lejal right to pay our bonds In silver, it must bo known to that Senator that for forty years tbu i country had nut coined silver dollars except for i exportation, and only a small amount i for such purpose. During all this i time the Government hud been In receipt of gold from customs duties, every dollar of j whicu was pledged for the psyment of the puollc i debt. Could it bo possible now that Congress i could soy » debt so contracted ci>a)d be paid In anything else hut gold! He quoted from tbe act of tbo ufltb of Feoraary, 1 Stiff, to establish a sink ing fund, etc., and sold If that act should be ear ned out tbo whole deal of tbe Government would jo paid In a very short time, it did seem to him that the public filth had been pledged to pay the bonds In gold coin. Our Secretaries of tnu Treasury had given Such pledges, and their acts bad never been repudiated oy Congress. Ho quoted from Bcc. 4 of thu Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of tuo United States lu regard to the validity of tbe public dent, and said that amendment was taunted to prevent those from tne Southern Mutes questioning lu validity, omt not to tight the heresies of Ohio. Now In this time of reconciliation. when Southern repre sentatives Uso been robaptwed in patriotism, he ap pealed to thorn to reject the proposition of too Senator from Ohio. There were various other points of that Senator's speech to which bo would llxe to refer, but ouo point In particular he could not pass. The Senator spoko of locking up money to order to gum there by. Did ho not know tout there never bad been a time In the history of the Government when money could be obtained more readily or at less Interest? He moved the reference of the resolution to the Committee on the Judiciary. Ur. Conklingsald be wished to submit an amend ment brfore Us reference. and that was to strike out the words: “lie it resolved, by lbs Senate, the HouseoflUcpresontalives concurring therein,” and insert In Ilea thereof the words: *♦ Resolved by the Senate sad House of Representative*.” He •aid bis purpose was to make It a Joint resolu tion instead of a concurrent resolution, so. If It was adopted. It would go to the President for his signature. The National Executive bad deposited' with him one-sixth of the legislative power, and.* In a case of such Importance as this be thought there should be an expression of tne full legtsla ' argued that it was perfectly com petent for either branch of Congress to declare its opinion os to what was the law of the laud, and It waa perfectly competent for the two Houses of Congress tu do so oy concurrent resolution, and if Congress entertained an opinion as to the existing •tale of the law, that opinion should not be nulli fied Oy a vole of tbo President. Hu wanted every body to understand the opinion of Congress, and then tbe President might act as be saw tit hereaf ter, but be did nut usk the President for ibis opinion now. The resolution submitted oy bis colleague (Matthews) raised the simple question of law. There was no necessity for referring it to a committee. There woe nothing upon tbe subject out ouo or two statutes, and no report any committee could make would lessen tbe debate in Iho Sena:* one boor. He was marvelously carious to kaow oy wbgt rea soning any lawyer could arrive at any other con clusion than that Expressed lu tbe resolution of bis colleague. Mr. Edmunds said tbe question with him at tbe F reseat moment was, w hat would Os tbs effect of he passage of this resolution upon toe public credit? it proposed to declare an opinion of mu (wo Houses of Congress, nut as a law, and what ef fect would that have upou the actual condition ol things? Was It nut more csnuid. If Congress was to say anything sheeting the puolic credit, that tt should bo done by law. in a rasuncr that would bo binding hereufiorf bueba resolution os this would be doing nothing in effect. It would uot injure the neb uoudhuldcr. the uloated bond lioluer was generally able to take care of himself, but tl would Injure thu widow, tbe orphan, the laboring classes, who had invested money m Gov ernment bonda, aud enable speculators uud gam blers to gamete ou tbu public credit.

By Mr. Kelley—A resolution amending the rules of the House so that tt will only be In order to sus pend tho rules upon the second ami fonrth Monday in each month, and during the last six days of tbo session. Mr. Wood. Chairman of the Committee on Wnya and Means, reported tho usual resolution’ for tne distribution of the President's annual message among Ihe various committees. The subjects re ferred to the Committee on Foreign Affairs are the war between Russia and Turkey, the rcuowal of tbo treaty between tho United States and Italy, questions as to naturalization* and commerce between tho United states and Germany, tho French Exposition, extradition articles of tho treaty of 1842 between tho United States and Great Britain, a treaty with Great Britain for the protection of trade-marks, recognition ofprealdcnt Dlbj! of Mexico, and difficulties on tho Uto Grande border, tho Insurrection tn Cuba and interference therein with Ihe rights of American citizens and other unsettled questions with Fpa.n, the unset tled claims of American clttxon* Against Venezuela, relations with the Central ami Sooth American States, and thu proposed recognition of the Gov ernment of the Samoan Islands. Mr. Hewitt (N. Y.) moved to amend tho resolu tion In reference to (he Committee on Foreign Af fairs by adding toll these words: “And that tbo Committee ou Foreign Affairs take into Immediate consideration the best means of removing existing and impending causes of difficulty between Mexico and the United Slates, and of confirming and en larging commercial relations between the two countries, hy treaty or otherwise, and hare leave to report tho result of Its deliberations, by resolu tion or otherwise, to the House at the earliest practicable day.” He went on to say: Tho peculiar language em ployed hr the President in speaking of this matter attracteu mv attention when tho message was read. I venture to call the attention of the House to the peculiar phraseology employed. Uis as follows: '•While l do nut anticipate an Interruption of friendly relations with Mexico, yet 1 cannot but look with some solicitude upon a continuance of border disorders as exposing tbe' two countries to Initiations of popular feeling and mischances of action wnlch are naturally anravor sole to complete amltr. Firmly determined that nothing shall be wanting on my part to pro mote a good nudurstanding between tbe two na tions. I yet must ask the attention of Congress to tho actual occurrenees on tbe border, that the lives and property of oar citizens may bo adeuuately protected ond peace preserved." And Mr. Hewitt continuing, said: ‘‘This passage looks in two di rections, Janus-like, either toward peace or to ward war. and if by any possibility we should bu plunged into hostilities with our neighbor, it will be alleged that Congress had duo notice and should bare token acttunln tho premises. This consider ation has induced mo to examine with some care tbo message of the President which was transmit ted to this House on tho hth of November, and which was referred tJlhc’Commlltcc on Foreign Affairs. Tho perusal of tbo documents accom panying that missive will convince tbo House that onr relations with Mexico nre In a very critical condition. Already several detachments of troops, acting nndcr tho orders of the President transmitted to Con. Uni, have Invaded Mexican territory against the protest of the de facto Gov ernment of that country, which, although it has been in power lunger than tho present Administra tion, has not yet been formally recognized by our Government. At this present moment a detach ment of American tru 'ps Is npon Mexican soil, but where no one knows, and if It should turn out that it has been captured, or that a conflict lias toaun between it and the Mexican troops whereby has boon abed, It must bo acknowledged tbat tbe danger of war will be very imminent. If not unavoidable. Wo cannot shut our eyes to these dangers. The country does not want war. It do ■ires a time of rest io recover from tbe losses of war. It desires an opportunity io strengthen it self In order to meet tho obligation* which It hue Incurred daring n lung and dunUuctlvo strug gle. A new war will add to these ob ligations, and make the burden of debt and pressure of taxation intolerable. What tho coun try desires Is to make them loss, and there Is no method of reducing these Durdens so effectually as to enlarge our trade with the neighboring coun tries. Mexico offers the moat Inviting fluid, as well as tbo nearest nrenue of sucu extension of trade. Our people desire to cultivate jwaceful re lations with a customer so near and valuable, und all will agree that iiiu establishment of better com mercial relations will be tbe eurest guarantee of peace. If a system of uescoful exchange ot com modities ujion terms of reciprocity could be estab lished along the borders of the Ilia (iramie, Instead of tbe present system of raids and repnsols, hostile collisions would euon be replaced by friendly com petition, and angry recrimination* by kindly greetings. This Mexican question must Ihi mot and solved la some way, cither by war, which no one duslres, or bt n protectorate, which line been discussed and condemned hy the general Judgment of the country, or, by closer commercial relations, enlarging the ties of mutual interest and cementing the natural harmony which should exist between nations producing products so dis similar us to invite and compel exchanges favor able to both. >Vo have no right to toko the risks of war when the paths of ponce sru open to us. At least, ae the stronger and older notion, we are bound by obvious cuiidderetlone of uiijmnnlmUv to exhaust every effort towards a peaceful eolation of the ousting troubles, and a substitution through treaties of reciprocity of mutual Interest for antagonism of passion and plunder. The dan ger is that, if tuts Congress should adjourn with out devising some peaceful solution, wemuy find ourselves, when we cumo back again, compelled to vote upou questions of supply tor military op erations wblcu wo cannot cofnao to make without an imputation upon oar patriotism and public spirit. Mr. lisle—l hope the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Hewitt) will bo adopted. It is in Ihe right direction. The coun try does not want war on anyfwoe ihxl has been tailed or in likely to oe raised. Mr. Reagan agreed that it was not well to Invoke war, and that It was the duly of the (Jovemmeut, If the way was open, to resort to peaceful inodes, and to Improve Ihe commercial ana friendly rela tions of the bulled Katesaud Mexico rather than to resort to any plan looking to war. lie intimated, however, that the existence of what ts known as the ••free 2anc," in Mexico, was an obstacle to commercial intercourse. Mr. Cox jN. Y.> favored Iboamonimant. Mr. Stephen* said: “I have looked upon this question of border trouble* tu Texas with acep Interest. I believe tbe fouling pervades Hit* whole country.

On th> roftrnrr, ever since he has been In Washington there had been an undercurrent of rumor* which had reached him occasionally, to the effect that the Administration was anxious to get the country Involved In war with Mexico, and he was clad to hear from the ccntle.iinu from Ohio that ho had been mbdnlortned In that re card, lie was very aure tbo country did not want war with Mexico, and did not wish to treat a weak sister Republic with less generosity than tt treated a great State.
