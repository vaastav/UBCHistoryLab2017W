Congress met on Monday last and in the Ledger's supplement wilt be found the President's Message. The House was organized by the election or lion. J. G. Carlisle for Speaker. In the Democratic caucus held on Saturday evening for nominating a candidate for this position, Mr. Car lisle received 106 votes out of 188. Of the votes of the representatives of democratic states, he got 75 out of 103. Of the votes of democratic representatives from republican states he obtained 22 out of 37 ; but of the 48 votes cast by democratic represent atives from the doubtful and so-called pivotal states he secured only 12. THE 

MESSAGE. The message is a neat document principally made up out of depart mental reports. Mr. Arthur directs attention to the following subjects : Fish, fishing tackle and fishermen ; pork, Turkey, coffee, petroleum. whisky, currency, and coast defence Of American fish, fishing tackle and fishermen, Mr. Arthur declares they have all maintained the foremost place in the competition of the world, The Kentucky fishing reel is no where excelled, and the president urges Congress to create a commission to consider American right to partici pate under just and enduring condi tions, in the richly stocked fishing wa ters and sealing grounds of British North America. Our relations with Turkey also need attention. The coffee we drink is mainly the product of Brazilian slave labor and subject to heavy export duties. Petroleum is burdened with restrictions in Tur key and other countries, and the President suggests that some measure of suitable retaliation therefor be de vised. In regard to the Internal Rev enue and the Tariff Mr. Arthur rec ommends that no measure of large diminution of them be adopted at present. He t-ecms to understand that the abolition of taxation on whisky and tobacco would necessitate the reformation of the tariff and the substitution of revenue duties for those that are merely protective ; and says that the results of the legisla tion of the last session have not as yet become sufficiently apparent to justify radical revision or sweeping modification of existing laws. Con cerning the currency, the President favors an extension of our bonded indebtedness, as a basis for national bank paper. The attentive reader will not find in the message much that antagonizes the proposed policy of the democrats of the lower House of Congress. When it comes to action, however, doubtless there will be ensugh difference in the partizan propositions of the political contes tants there to make reading of the congressional debates interesting. A lawful fence in this State is de fined as follows, section 5,652, R. S., page 1,113 . All hedges shall be at least four feet high, and all fences composed of posts and rails, posts and palings, posts and wire, posts and planks or palisades, shall be at least four and a half feet high ; those composed of turf shall be at least four feet high, and with ditches on cither side at least three feet wide at the top, and three feet deep; and what is commonly called a worm fence, shall be at least five feet high to the top of the rider, or if not ri dered, shall be five feet to the top of the top rail or pole, and shall be lock ed with strong rails, poles or stakes ; those composed of stone or brick ba!! be at least four and a half feet high." In this county since the re cent special election it is not necessary to make these fences "hog proof" except where it is desired to restrain and confine one's own hogs. Debyns & Gibbs. The above named gentlemen have opened their palace drug store, and are to the front with a mammoth ad vertisement in the Ledger this week, as they always will be. Ben. F. Dobyns is ex-collector of Audrain county, and a fine business man, square in every sense of the word, and is known to every man, woman and child in the county. Renfro Gibbs is a practical druggist of expe rience, belonging to the State Asso ciation, and a registered druggist Mr. Gibbs has a diploma, besides having a fine reputation as a com pounder of prescriptions. He wil . personally attend to this branch of the business, day and night. This is one of the finest and best furnished drug stores in the AVest. They: have a full and complete line of all kinds of druggist's staple and fancy goods soaps, paints, oils, sundries, patent medicines, glass, cigars and tobaccos, &c. Call and see them. The Columbia Sentinel, speaking of the neat speech of our esteemed fellow-townsman, J. Virgil Williams, at the A. O. IT. W. Meeting at Cen tralis, says.: Our supper finished, we returned to the hall in time to hear the address of Mr. Virgil Williams of Mexico. And a nice address it was, too. Ornate, eloquent, forcible, abounding in beautiful figures, fin ished periods and rhetorical conclu sions, it was a credit to himself and to the legion which he represented." There are about nine prospective candidates in this district for con gress next year. It is unnecessary to prophecy right here at this early day that only one is chosen from the many who think they are called. Klu MatUe Tickers as "Jaeqitae."

St. Louit BepubUean . Female Base Ball Tessera. Correspondence of the Ledger. St. Loos, Mo., Nov. 29. Won ders will never cease, and Yankee ingenuity and cunning propensity to accumulate will only stop when all that is hidden has been revealed, and there is nothing left to excite the curiosity, or woo the western man from his henest toil, that be may pay tribute to the ennning tricks of Eas tern sharpers. The latest sensation in St. Louis is the female base ballists of the East. All in gorgeous attire, which simply shows the symmetrical shape without any superfluity of skirts, trails or trimmings. Under the guardianship of a shrewd-locking dude-like commander, who wore pantaloons, this novel combination of beauty, composed of blondes and brunettes, made its appearance Pitchers, catchers, short-stops and fielders all banged and begilded, and leautiful as nymphs of olden legend. We have read of the Ama zons of the East, of the courtly splendors of Cleopatra's command of virgins as her fleet floated down the river Cydnus to exstatic strains of melody, while the glimmer of silver oars bedazzled those who propelled her through the perfumed air which surrounded her fair flotilla. We have heard of all this but like Sheba's Queen, our eyes had not seen the greatest wonder till we gazed in rapt urous surprise upon the two nines of female base ball clubs in St. Louis But shame upon the western man's distorted tastes and uncultivated manners. This band of semi-dressed beautiful base ballists had drawu like a mirage reflected from another world, all over the East that city of God Boston where to speak of worldly matters on the Sabbath day is an of fense to the state law. She in her godliness and piety, poured out from her best society, the adoration and applause of an appreciating public Philadelphia crowned them with lau rels; Hartford strewed her streets with flowers for them. But "poor old Missouri" was as backward and uncivilized in her reception and pat ronage of the fair band as she was with those noble gentlemen, Messrs Slade and Mitchell, who suffered so much that we might have a first-class entertainment in the West. New York didn't treat them that way Oh, what a pity, that "poor old Mis souri" has advanced so little that she would allow the most beautiful band of women on earth to actually have to pawn their baggage right here in this, the metropolis of "poor old Missouri." Put it up for board bills, due and unpaid, and go back East and tell of us that they "were not appreciated on the Western slope." Now the East has not treated us that way. They have wined and dined two of the nicest boys who belonged to our James gang. The two who bravely shot a comrade from behind, and it makes as feel so bad to think a hard-hearted landlord in St. Louis would treat a female base ball club so and keep their pretty dresses just for board. We are a native Mis sourian, and the mantel of shame colors our modest cheek, that we Missourians should be so lost to shape and talent as to let a female base ball nine go into bankruptcy here in St, IOuis for want of patronage.

ITEMS FROM LADDON'IA. Special Correspondence of the Ledger. Laddosia, Mo., December 4. This is a beautiful day and here comes the corn rolling in by hundreds of bush els. It is selling, this morning, at 30 cents. The new elevator is grow ing rapidly. They have just dug a large well for the use of the elevator which is about completed. This morning, Mr. Bridgeford cag ed his eagle ready to shin to St Louis, where it will be placed on exhibition. The S. S. Convention held here last Sunday was well attended and the programme was very nearly filled. Miss Fannie Scanland read a good essay on "Our Mistakes;" A. E. Myers read a good paper on the Aims of the S. S." The subject of an "Evergreen S. S." was discuss ed by Rev. G. B. Smith and Mrs. C. II. Alexander and others. Some of the speakers got the last named ques tion a little confounded in its state ment in the way of saying a S. S. in an evergreen S. house and a "green S. S. in every S. house." Though these mistakes were a little laughable, the discussion was ably conducted. Miss Annie Fletcher read an excel lent paper on "The S. S., a promoter of religion, morality and education." She is a fine scholar and understood her subject well. "The S. S., the nursery 'it the church" was ably dis cussed by Dr. Wayman. Most of the S. S. in the township gave favor able reports. The query box con tained many questions of interest. The music, under the management of Mr. Corner as leader, and Miss Pearl Hughes as organist, was very good. We think the S. S. Conventions arc doing good. They bring those to gether that are interested in the work ; they exchange thoughts, and the lead ing questions pertaining to the S. S. are discussed and each person learns something new.: We noticed several from a distance present, among the number Misses Annie and Nellie Mc Nsmy, and Mr. Cross of Mexico; Messrs. Kelly and Venetty of Farber. Two 4,new additions" have been added to the town since last week! Charlie - Sogers surveyed about 32 lots in the additions made by S. W. Case, and also an addition made by J. P. Smith. The Enterprise is, growing; many new subscribers have been adtforl r, its list. ; The Enterprise is mistaken who "Jimmie Jones" was or is. r the case may be. We don't wish to claim another's writing, let it be ever so good. Honor to when, honor is due. We never call out-self Jones. Smith or Brown, as those families are large enoueh : but if we were allowed three guesses, we think we couM guess who "Jimmie J. is." . Ajrsia Lacbie. Swinney Snes Simon for $10,000 Damnges of two Kinds. . Miss Kerney Swinney has sued Si mon Earsom, a farmer north of Stur geon, Mo., in Audrain county, fur $10,000. Miss Swinney has been working as a servant girl in the fami ly "of Earsom for a year past. A short time ago Mr. Earsom missed a $10 bill out of his pocket book which he kept in a wardrobe drawer. Every once in a while he would miss a small sum of money ; and at last began to suspect that Miss Swinney was taking it. He claims that he also dreamed that she was getting it and if he would look in her bed be would find the missing money. Acting on the force of bis vision he swore out a warrant and had the girl arrested and searched. No money was found upon the girl, but some four dollars in change was found in her bed, but not enough to make out a case and she was therefore released. Now the girl has brought two suits against him in the Audrain circuit court. One is for $5,000 damages for malicious prosecution, and $5,000 for slander, she alleging that he talked about her in a manner calculated to weaken faith in her virtue. Centralia Guard. The above, without doubt, will prove an interesting case. It is the only sensational case now on our docket The western portion of Audrain is coming to the front with its share of news here lately. Share and Share Alike. "Look here, young mah," said a Laddonia parent to his daughter's lover when the latter entered the par lor to make his first call of the indoor season the other night, "look heie; you burned up a good deal of wood and kerosene last winter, calling around here and staying till 10 and 10:30 two or three nights a week. Now I have no objections to your visits, as you are a respectable young man, but you've got to find your own fuel and lights this winter. I cannot afford to keep fires running and a lamp burning in this parlor all . the winter. "All right, sir," responded the young man, cheerfully, "I'm willing to share the expense, but you should hardly ask me to bear the whole of it, Suppose you furnish the wood and I furnish the light. How will that do?" "All right," said the parent, as he turned to leave the room. "I'm will ing to bear my share of the expense if you bear yours." "Let's see." said the clear-headed youth, as he sat down beside his lady love, "how much oil did we burn last winter, ?" "Why, ," she replied, with a blush, "we didn't burn a lampful during the whole winter." "I know it," said ,with a laugh, "but you needn't telll yOur pa what a soft thing I've got on him." Teachers' Institute-Prairie Township. In compliance with the duty assign ed me at the Teachers' Meeting held at Mexico November 2nd, I urgently request all teachers of Prairie Town ship to meet me at Beagles' School House Saturday, December 8th, for the purpose of organizing a Township Institute and carrying out the pro gramme furnished by the county com mittee.

Botts, Township Vice-President, Miss Mattie Tickers. Miss Mattie Tickers surprised the reg ular patrons of the Opera Honse last night with a performance so much su perior in an artistic sense to Minne Pal mer's that the majority will give the palm to Miss Vlckers, who is a grace ful, intelligent and handsome actress. She shines in the line she has chosen, and is as sure to make her mark to become a great public favorite, as the sun Is sure to shine somewhere to-morrow. The performance is of nondescript order, but it is very pleasing, and there is nothing offensive in it. Mr. Rogers a clevor ac tor, gives capital imitations of well- known actors. The marvel is that such a clever lot of people should come in at the fag end of the season. They are worthy the best weeks In a seacon. Pittsburg Daily Chronicle. "Papa, what do you expect to give me for a Christmas present?" asked a young lady of her father, our well known police court justice. "Give you," said Lncle Frank, whose mind was evidently upon something else "Give you I'll give you thirty days." On account of this remark the young lady will get an unusually handsome present to keep her from joking her papa about his thought lessness. School Programmes. The publishing of county school programmes is becoming a big thing in this county. When the teachers are patrons of this paper, we take pleasure in favoring them. Otherwise such matters will be, charged for as advertising. Prof. J. P. Blanton was in Mexico last Saturday. The Professor has a host of friends in Mexico and all over the State. He has brought the Kirks ville State Normal to the front with a boom. Rev. S. S. Martin and wife, and son, T. O.. Martin, of Delevan, 111.. are visiting Mr. and Mrs. S. P. Mar tin of this city. There is not hitching room around the square, or for three blocks each way, for the teams that are in Mexico every Saturday.
