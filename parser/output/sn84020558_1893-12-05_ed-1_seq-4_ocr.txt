THB ABIZONA REPUBLICAN CO. " THE MESSAGE The president's message which has Deen awaited with perhaps greater in terest than any previous similar docu ment was presented to congress yester day. It had been announced from inner circles that it would be volumin ous and though were its author natur ally less prolix there were still amnla reasons why this document should be one of extraordinary length. Not within a quarter of a century have so many and so grave questions vexed an administration, and the vexa- a: 1 . nun dss Deen more intense in that the questions tnemselves are the direct products of the administration. Those who had hoped that additional light would be shed upon the national com. plications or that some further forecast of the government's plans would be afforded have been doomed to disap pointment. There is all through the messaee an impression of that sense of painful re sponsibility which is so characteristic of Mr. Cleveland. But that is all that and vociferation, succeeded in awaken ing him. The drummer sleepily and profanely begged to remain undis turbed, but in answer to Mr. Groghan's ! importunities he explained that he had j changed his mind. Thereupon, Mr. j ruKuau xiCKea the door down. He dragged the astonished drummer from his bed, exclaiming at the same timp "Yezshpalpeen, me instructions are to moind yez don't miss the thrain Mr. Cleveland is determined to hold the country to its foolish wail of dis content a year ago.

It contains absolutely nothing new. The allusion to the Hawaiian question is a condensa tionof the already expressed views of secretary Greaham. Mr. Cleveland's financial utterances and his altitnri nn the silver question are in nowise differ. ent from those with which the country was made acquainted at the opening of thn extraordinary session. His sugges tions and recommendations are mioh have already been marl k n.. .w Luc heads of the various departments in their recently published reports. Even the tariff portion of the docu ment ie a reiteration of that division of the famous message to the Fiftieth con gress and which sounded the keynote of Democratic defeat in 1888. One sentence of Mr. Cleveland's in this con nection 19 significant. Says he: "After a full discussion our countryman hr spoken in favor of this reform and they have confided the work of its accomp lishment to the hands of those who are solemnly pledged to it." It may be asked, to which expression of our countrymen does the Dresidpnt allude? Was it to that given in 18!)2 or to that later spontaneous expression a month ago? Is it not possible that Mr. Cleveland has misinterpreted the will of the people, and has failed to recognize the possibility of a national change of opinion, based on a later ac quired experimental knowledze of th subject? It is evident, thoneh. th.t wuatevei iiiterpieU'bioii the president. may put upon the feeling of the people, ha intends. ' ijuooiuic, lu iorce tariff reform upon the countrv in th form of the Wilson bill, which h dares has been constructed nnnn th lines suggested in the message. By his allusion to the will nf people Mr. Cleveland is strongly re mindful of the porter of . rural T,- ana hostelry, one Mr. Miles Groghan, whose most valuable characteristic was an unwavering faithfulness to instruc tion from the office, as Tshown hv th. following incident: A commercial traveler had 'call" for an early morning train Mr. Groghan was directed 'to ..Un him. After retiring the drummer de cided to take a later train, rmt n. Iected to inform the office of his change of plan.
