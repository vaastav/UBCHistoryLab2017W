PRESIDENTS MESSAGE. ftttou CUIzent of tKe Senate and Bouse of Itepre tetuatinte: The members of the Forty-sixth Congress have assembled in their first regular session under circumstances calling for mutual congratulation and gratef ul acknowledgment to the Giver of all good for the large and unusual measure of Na tional prosiienty which we now enjoy. The most interesting event which have occur red in our public affairs sinoe my last annual message to Congress are connected with the . I ..CL.- l..,i.nm,3nt .I.rAyitlv financial oMauoiiB ui iuu vwc..i.v-..v affecting the business interests ot the conntry. I congratulate Congress on the successful execu tion of the resumption act. At the time fixed and in the suanner contemplated by law. United States notes began to be redeemed in coin. Since the first of January last they have been promptly redeemed en presentation, and in all business transactions, public and private, in all parts of the country, thev are received and paid out as the equivalent of coin. The demand upon the Treasury for gold and silver in exchange for United States notes has been comparatively small, awl the voluntary deposit ot coin and bullion in exchange for notes has been very large. The excess of the precious metals depos ited or exchanged for United States notes over the amount of United States notes redeemed is bout tMO.Oil0.0O0. TUt. 

RESUMPTION OF SPECIE PAYMENTS has been followed by a very great revival of busi ness. With a currency equivalent in value to toe money of the commercial world, we are ena bled to enter npon an equal competition with other nations in trade and production. The in creasing foreign demand for our manufactures and agricultural products has caused a large balance of trade in our favor, which has been paid in gold, from the lstot July last to novem her 15. to the amount of about 59,000,0(K). Hinc( the resumption of specie payments there has also been a marked and gratifying improvement if the public credit. The bonds of the Govern ment bearing only four per cent, interest have been sold at or above par, sufficient in amount to pay off all the National debt which was re deemable under present laws. The amount of interest saved annually by the process of re funding the debt, since Jlaren 1, 1877, is ipn.297,. 177. The howls sold were largely in small sums, and the number of our citizens now holding the public securities Is much greater than ever be- i . r .i t: I .i..L. u:. .l lore, ine amount or me nntumui uui wmc, mature within less than two voars is 792.I21, TO, of which 5XI.0iX).CMJ bear interest at the rate of five per cent., and the balance is in bonds bearing six per cent, interest. It is believed that this part of the public debt can be refunded by the issue of four per cent, bonds and, by the re duction of interest which will thus be effected, abont eleven million of dollars can be annually saved to the Treasury. To secure this important reduction of interest to be paid by the United (States, further legislation is required, which, it is hoiied, will be provided by Congress during its present session. The coinage of gold by the mints of the Uni ted States, during the last fiscal year was 40, 86,112. The coinage of silver dollars, since the Csage ot the act tor that pmpose. up to Novom 1. 1879. was 46,(KKI.850. of which 12,70(),344 have been issued from the Treasury and are now in circulation, and $32,300,506 are still in the pos session of the Government. The pendency of the proposition for unity of action between the United States and the pnn 4iiml commercial nations of Knrope. to effect e permanent system for the equality of gold anil silver in the recognized money of the world, lewis me to recommend that Congress refrain from new legislation on the general subject. The great revival ot trade, internal and foreign, will tnmlv during the coming year, its own instruc tions, which may well heawaited fief ore attempt ing further exiiorimentai measures with the coinage. 1 would, however, strongly urge upon Congress tne importance or aiiinnri.ing me Hoc retarv ol the Treasury to suspend the coinage ol silver dollars uism the present legal ratio. The market value ot the silver dollar being uniform ly and largely less than the market value of the gold uouar, it is ouviousiy impracticamo shown and which it is within Its power to effectual examination under uniform supervis remeuy. I again invoke the co-operation of the ion, a number of eminently competent persona executive and legislative authorities of the were selected for the purpose, who entered with States in this great purpose. 1 am fully oon vinrwu) that, if the mihlin mind can be set at rest on this paramount question or popular rignis, no serious obstacle will thwart or delay the com plete pacification of the oountry, or retard the general ditiusion or prosperity, zeal unon the discharge of '.heir duties, prepared with an intelligent appreciation of the require ment of the Bervioe, the regulations contem plated, and took charge of the examinations, and who, in their capacity as a board have been known as the "Civil Service Commission."

In view of the facts that during a considerable period, the Government of Great Britain has been dealing with administrative problems and abuses, in various particulars analogous to those presented m tins country, anu. mil in recent needed for the compensation and for the ex. pense of carrying on the work of the Commis sion. It appears from the report of the Commission, submitted to the President in April, 1874, that examinations had been held in various sections of the country, and that an appropriation of about i25,000 would be required to meet the an nual expenses, including salaries, involved in discharging the duties of the Commis sion.

UNITED STATES NOTES, with the capacity of legal-tender in private con tracts, is a step to be taken in our progress to ward a saf e and stable currency, which should be accepted as the policy and duty of the Gov ernment, and tne interest ana security of the people. It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal-tender puiier money based wholly upon the authority and credit of the Government, ex cept in extreme emergency, is without warrant in the Constitution, and a violation of sound financial principles. The issue of United States notes during the late oivil war with the capacity of lrjral-tewfor between private individuals was not authorized except as a means of rescuing the country from imminent pern, i no circulation if these notes as K',r money, for any protracted period of time alter the accomplishment of this purpose, was not contemplated by the frameraof tne law mmm' wnieu mny were issued ihey an ticipated tlio redumption and withdrawal uf these notes at the earliest practicable period con. sistent with the attainment of the object for winch they ware provided. The polioy of the United States, steadilv adhered to from the adoption of the Con stitution, has been to avoid the creation of a National debt, anil when, from necessity in time uf war, debts have been created, they have ksen paid off on the return of peace as rapidly as pisisible. With this view, and forums puriMwe.it is recommended that the existing laws for the accumulation of a sinking fund sufficient to extinguish the public debt within a limited period bs maintained. If any change of the ohjuct or rates of taxation is i(iniisl necessary by Congress, it is suggested that experience has shown that s duty can bs placed on tea asd coffee, which will not enhance the price of those articles to the consumer, and which will add several millions of dollars an nually to the rrtsury.

I thought it desiral information upon the subject, and accordingly requested the Chairman of the Civil Service Commission to make a thorough investigation for this purpose. The result has been an elabo rate and comDrehensive report, The renort sets forth the history of the partisan spoils system in Great Britain, and of the rise and tall of ths parliamentary patronage, and of official interference with the lreenom or eico tiins. It shows that after long trials of various kinds of examinations, those which are com petitive and open on equal terms to all, and which are carried on under the superintendence of a single commission, have, with great advan tage, been established as conditions of admission to almost every official place in the subordinate administration of that country and of British India. The completion of the report, owing to the extent of the labor involved in its prepara tion, and the omission of Congress to make any provision either for the compensation or the ex penses of the Commission, Futs been postponed until the present time. It is herewith trans mitted to Comrress. While the reform measures of another Govern mcnt are of no authority for us, they are enti' tied to influence, to the extent to which their in trinsic wisdom, and their adantation to our in stitutions and social iife, may commend them to our consideration. The views I have heretofore expressed concern ing the defects and abuses in our oivil adminis tration remains unchanged, except in bo tar as an enlarged experience has deepened my sense of the duty both of officers and of the people themselves to co-operate for their removal. The grave evils and perils of a partisan-spoils system of appointment to office and of office tenure, are now generally recognized. In the resolutions of the great parties, in the reports of Departments, in the debates and proceedings of Congress, in the message of Executives, the gravity of these evils has been pointed out and the need of their reform has been admitted, To command the necessary support, every measure of reform must be based on common right and Justice, and muBt be compatible with the healthy existence of great parties, which are incvitanie and essential in a tree state. When the people have approved a policy at a National election, confidence on the part of the officers they have selected, and of the advisers who. in accordance with our political mstitu. tions. should be consulted, in the policy which it is their duty to carry into effect, is indispen sable. It is eminently proper that they should explain it before the people, as well as illustrate its spirit in the performance of their ollioialuu tics. Very different considerations apply to tho greater number of those who fill thesubordinate places in the civil service. Their rosiionsibilty is to their superiors in official position. It is their duty to obey the legal instructions of those upon whom that authority is devolved, and their best public service consists in the discharge of their functions irrespective of partisan politics. Their duties are the samo, whatever party is in power and whatever polioy prevails. As a conse quence, it follows that their tenure ot office should not depend on the prevalence of any poli cy or the supremacy of any party, but should be determined by their capacity to serve the people most uBoiuuy. quite irresiieciive Ol partisan in terests. The same considerations that should govern the tenure, should also prevail in the ap pointment, discipline and removal of these sub ordinates. The authority of appointment and removal is not a perquisite, which may bo used to aid a friend or reward a partisan, but is a trust to be exercised in the imUio interest, un der all the sanctions which attend the obligation to apply the public funds only for public pur poses. Jiverv citizen has an ooual riirht to the honor anu pront or entering the punno service ot his country. The only just ground of discrimina tion is the measure of character and capacity he has to maKe tuac service most usctul to t he doo. pie. Kxcept in cases where, upon Just and rec ognized principles, as unon the theorv of nun- sions, offices and promotions are bestowed as re wards for past services, their bostowal npon any theorv which disregards personal merit is an act of injustice to the citizen, as well as a breach of that trust subject to which the appointing pow er is held. In the light of these principles, it becomes of great importance to provide Just ana adequate means.especiallY for everv department, and larie administrative office, where personal discrim ination on the part of its head is not practicable, for ascertaining those qualifications to which ap pointments anu removals snouiu nave reference. To fail to provide such means is not only to deny the opportunity of ascertaining the facts upon which the most righteous claim to office depends put, 01 necessity, to discourage all worthy aspirants, by handing over appointments and removals to mure inn nonce and favor itism If it IS ths rnrht of the wortliinst nlsimnnt to twin l.ha uiii.iinfmunl ami tne interest or tne people to oostow it npon nun, it would seem clear that a wise and Just method of ascertaining personal fitness for office must be an important and permanent function of every Just and wise government. It has long since become impossible, in the great offices, for those having the duty of nomination and ap pointment to personally examine into the indi vidual (nullifications of more than a small nrn. portion of those, seeking office; and. with the en largement of the civil service that proportion must continue to become less. la the earlier years of the Government the subordinate offices were so few in numVer that it was quite easy for those making appointments and promotions to personally ascertain the merits of candidates.

The rules, as they have hitherto been enforced, have resulted beneficially, as is shown bv the oninions of the members of the Cabinet and tkeir subordinates in the Depart ments, and in that opinion I concur." A.nd in the annual message of December of the same year similar views are expressed, and an appro priation for continuing the work of the Com mission again advised. The appropriation was not mane, anu, as a con sequence, the active work ot the Commission was suspended, leaving the Commission itself still in existence. Without the means, therefore. of causing qualifications to be tested in any sys tematic manner, or of securing for the public service the advantages of competition upon any extensive plan, I recommended in my annual message of December, 1877, the making of an ap propriation for the resumption of the work of the Commission. In the meantime however. competitive exam mo tions under many embarrassments have been con ducted within limited spheres in the Executive Departments in Washington,and in a number of the Custom houses and Postofiices of the princi pal cities of the oountry, with a view to further test their effect, in every instance, they have been found to be as salutary as thev are stated to have been under the administration of my predecessor. I think the economy, purity and erucieney ot the public service would oe greatly promoted by their systematic introduction, wherever practicable, throughout the entire civil service of the Government, together with ample provision for their general supervision, in order to secure consistency and uniform justice. Keports from the Secretary of the Interior, from the Postmaster General, from the Post master in the citv of New Vork. where such ex aminations have been, some time on trial, and also from the Collector "ut the port, the Naval officer and the Surveyor in that city, and from the Postmasters and Collect ors in several of the other large cities, show that the competitive system, where ap plied, has in various ways, contributed to im urove the nublic service. The reports show that the results have been salutary in a marked degree, and that the L" eral application of similar rules cannot fail to be ot decided henc.hr. r.o the service. The reports ot the Government officers, in the city ot New Kork especially, bear decided testi mony to the utility of onen competitive exam nations, in their respective offices, showing that tilt-Be examinations, arm tne excellent ouuiiii- cutions of those admitted to the service through them, have had a marked incidental effect upon the persons previously in the service, "and partic ularly upon those aspiring to promotion. There has been, on the part of these latter, an increased interest in the worn, and a desire to extend ac quaintance with it beyond the particular desk occupied, and thus the morale of the entire force has been raised. The examinations have been attended by many citizens who have had an omiortunitv to thoroughly investigate the scope and character of the tests and the method of determining tho results, and those visitors have, without exception, approved the methods employed, and several or them have publicly at tested their favorable opinion. Upon such considerations. I deem it mv dutv to renew the recommendation contained my annual message of December. 1H77. request ing Congress to make the necessary appropria tion for the resn-nntinn of the work of the Civil Service Commission. Economy will be pro moted Dy authorizing a moueraio compensation to persons in the public service who may perform extra labor upon or under the Commission, as tne &xeoa tive may direct, T am convinced that if a lust and adequate test of merit is enforced for admission to the mi til in service and in makinir nromotlons. sue abuses as removals without good cause anil par tisan and official interference with the proper ex ercise uf the appointing power, will in large measure disappear. There are other administrative abuses to which the attention of Congress should be asked in this connection. Mere partisan appointments, and theoonstant peril of removal without cause, very naturally load to an absorbing and mischievous political activity, on the part of those thus ap tuiiotjwl. which not onlv interferes with the due discharge ot official duty, out is incompatible il . a i b - fcr..A 4 Wltn toe uoeoonioi eioobioun, hoi wituout war rant, in the views of several of mv predecessors in the Presidential office, and directly within the law of 1H71, already cited, 1 endeavored by regu lation, made on the 2A1 dav nf June. 1877. to put some reasonable limits to such abuses.

The important questions sinoe the en actment of these laws have been as to the char acter of the examinations, and whether official favor and partisan influence, or common right assl merit, were to oontrol the access to the ex aminations. In practice, thmc examinations have ot always been open Ut worthy persona general ly. ao might wish to be examined.

OUR KKLATKlNS WITH FOREIGN OOCNTBIES have continued neaceful. With Great Britain there are still unsettled questions, growing out of the local laws of the maritime provinces and the action of provincial authorities, deemed to be in derogation of rights scoured by treaty to American fishermen. The United States Minister in lioudon has been in structed to present a demand for $lli5,306.02, in view of the damages received by American citi zens at Fortune Buy on ths 6th of January, 1878. The subject has been taken into consideration by the British Government, and an early reply is anticipated. Upon the completion of the necessary prelimi nary examinations, the subject of our partioi)a tinn in the provincial fisheries, as regulated by treaty, will at once be brought to the attention of the British Government with a view to an early and permanent settlement of the whole question, which whs only temporarily adjusted by tho Treaty of Washington. Efforts have been made to obtain the removal of restrictions found injurious to the exporta tion of cattle to the United Kingdom. Some correspondence has also occurred with regard to the rescue and saving of life and prop erty msin the lakes, which has resulted in im portant mislincationa nf the previous regula tions of ths Dominion Government on the sub ject in the interest of humanity and oommeroe. In accordance with the Joint resolution of the last session of Congress, Commissioners were ap pointed to represent the united states at the two International Exhibitions in Australia, one of which is now in progress at Sydney, and the other is to be held next vear at Melbourne. A desire has been expressed by our merchants and manufacturers interested in the important and growing trade with Australia, that an increased provision should bs made by Congress for the representation of our industries at the Mel bourns Exhibition of next year, and the subject la nxMHH-tliilly submitted to your favorable consideration. The assent of the Government has been given to the landing, on the coast of Massachusetts, of a new anu imixpr.Nnr.wr TRANiAnjiTrio cabi.c hWween Francs, by way of the French island of St. Pierre, and this country, subject to any fu ture legislation of Congress en the subject.

It is a gratification to be able to announce that, through the judicious and energetic action of the military commanders of the two Nations on each side of the Itio Grande, under the in structions of their respective Governments, raids and depredations have greatly decreased, and, in the localities where formerly most destructive, have now almost who'ly ceased. In view of this result. 1 entertain a confident expectation that the prevalence of quiet on the border will soon become so assured as to justify a modification of the present orders to our military commanders as to crossing the border, without encouraging such disturbances as would endanger the peace of the two countries.

The satisfactory situation between the two countries leads me to anticipate an expansion of our trade with Mexi co, and an increased contribution ot capital and industry by our people to the development of the great resources of that oountry. I earnestly commend to tho wisdom of Congress the pro vision of suitable legislation looking to this re sult. Diplomatic intercourse with Colombia is attain fully restored by the arrival of a minister from that conntry to the United States. This is es pecially fortunate in view of the fact that the question of an iitterooeanic canal has recently assumed a new and importuntaspect, and is now The history of TUB OUTMUSAJC ON THE WHITE RIVER UTE RESERVA TION in Western Colorado has become so familiar bv elaborate reports in the public press that its re- marKable incidents need not be suited here in de tail.

The other disturbance occurred at the Meson lero Agency, in New Mexico, where Victorio, the head of a small band of marauders, after com mitting many atrocities, being vigorously chased by a military force, mode his way across the Mexican border and is now on foreign soil.

Diplomatic relations with Chili have also been strengthened by the reception of a minister from that oountry. The war between Porn. Bolivia and Chili atill continues. The United States have not deemed it proper to interpose in the matter, further than to convey to all the Governments ooncerned. the assurance that the friendly offices of the Govern ment of the United States for the restoration of peace upon an honorable basis wifl be extended in case the belligerents shall exhibit a readiness to accept them. Cordial relations continue with Brazil and the Argentine nepublic, and trade with those coun tries is improving. A provision for regular and more frequent mail communication, in our own ships, between the ports of this country and the nations of Bouth America seems to me to deserve the attention of Congress, as an essential pre cursor of an enlargement of our oommeroe with mem. and an extension ot our carrying trade.

The third article of the treaty with Russia, of larch 8 . 186). bv which Alaska was oeded to the United States, provides that the inhabitants of the ceded territory, with the exception of the uncivilized native tribes, shall be admitted to the enjoyment of all the rights of citizens of the United States, and shall be maintained and pro tected in tho free enjoyment of their liberty, property and religion. The uncivilized tribes are subjected to such laws and regulations as the United states may Irom time to time adopt in regard to the aboriginal tribes of that oountry. Both the obligations of this treaty and the necessities of the people, require that some or ganized form of government over the Territory of Alaska be adopted. There appears to be no law for the arrest of persons charged with common-law off ences, such as assault, robbery, and murder, and no magis trate authorized to issue or execute process in such cases. Serious difficulties have already arisen from offenses of this character, not onlv among the original inhabitants, but among eiti sens of the United States and other countries, who have engaged in mining, fUhinp, and other business operations within the Territory.

" No appropriation was made for this nnrnnu for the ourrent year. As no general election for members of Congress occurred, the omission was a matter of little practical importance. Such election will, however, take place during the ensuing year, and the appropriation made for the pay of marshals and deputies should be sufficient to em brace compensation lor ttie serv ices they may be required to perform at such elections. The business of the Supreme uonrt is. at pres ent, largely in arrears. It cannot beexiiectvdthat more causes can be decided than are now disoosed of in its annnal session or that by any assiduity the distinguished magistrates who compose the court can accomplish more than is now done. In the court of many of tne circuits, also, the busi ness has increased to such an extent that the de lay ot justice will oail the attention of Congress to an appropriate remedy. It is believed that all is done in each circuit which can fairlv be expected from its judicial force. The evils aris ing from delav are less heavily felt bvthe United States than by private suitors, as its causes are advanced by the courts when it is seen that they involve the discussion of uuestions of a nublic character. The remedy suggested by the Attorney-General is the appointment of additional Circuit Judges. and the creation of an intermediate Court of Er rors and Appeals, which shall relieve the Sn- ireine Court of a part of its jurisdiction, while a arger force is also obtained for the performance of circuit dntir. I commend this suggestion to the considera tion of Congress. It would seem to afford a com plete remedy, snd would involve, if ten sddi. j bona! Circuit Judges are appointed, so expendi- j inhabiting it would do well to prepare for such a contingency. I therefore fully anurove oftharf. vice given to them by the Secretary of the Interior on a recent occasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to scuiiire indiviniml titu i fee, instead of their present tribal ownership in common, and to consider in what manner the bal ance of their lands may be disposed of bv the Gov ernment for their benefit. By adopting such a policy they would more certainly secure for them selves tue vaiue oi ineir possessions, and at the Bame time promote their progress in civilization and prosperity, than by endeavoring to perpetu ate the present state of things in the Territory. The question whether a change in the control of the lndiau service should be made was In the Forty-fifth Congress referred to a joint committee of both Houses for Inquiry and report. In my last annual message I expressed the hope that the ucviciim ui mat (juesuoii, men ln proepect "would arrest further agitation on this subject.' snch agitation being apt to produce a disturbing effect upon the service as well as the Indians themselves." Since then, the committee having reported, the question has been decided in ths negative by a vote la the House of Kepresenta tlves, j r " For the reasons here stated, tnd ln view of the fact that further uncertainty on this point will be calculated to obstruct other much-needed legisla tion, to weaken the discipline of tha service and to unsettle saluttry tneasnres now in procrem for the government sad Improvement of the Indians I respectfully recommend that thriari.inn.-. ! at by Congress at its last Beesion be permitted to stand.
