Stockholm. —The Associated Press correspondent recently had an Inter view with Henryk Sienkiewicz (author of "Quo Vadis" and other well knowu books) prior to his receiving the Nobel prize lor literature. The novelist said: "I have not been in Poland for three weeks. The situation in Russia and in Poland is extremely bad. The bureau cracy can not last much longer with or without, revolution. Its days are count ed. The Russian people are good, but the bureaucracy are a set of thieves. That was proved by the war. Count Witte's position is most difficult. Witte is clever and of great ability, but it is doubtful if he will be able to retain his position. "We are In the greatest danger as Poles, and a German occupation of Poland is possible if this revolutionary movement gets beyond the control of the Russian government. Perhaps such occupation would be by consent of the Russian government and perhaps not. However, it th<> Russian government should acquiesce in the occupation of Russian Poland in whole or in part by Germany the act would be resisted not only in Poland, but in Russia.

Over Two Hundred Thousand More Than Last Year—Pacific Ports Show Decrease—On Account of Jap-Russo War—Slavs and Huns Most Promi nent—Fewer From Germany. In presenting the annual report of the bureau of immigration, Commis sioner General Bargent refers to the magnitude and gravity of the problems presented by the growth of the alien population of ti.e United States. "These problems," he declared, "loom so largely in the prospect of our country that it may be said without giving just cause to charge exaggera tion, that all other questions of public economy relating to things rather than to human beings, shrink into compara tive insignificance." The total alien arrivals reported for the year of 1,026,499 represents an in crease over the preceding year of 213, --629, of which the continental ports of the United suites report an Increase of 196,940, as compared with arrivals last year, and Canadian ports 13,830. At th-i insular ports the increase was 2Hi(3, although the arrivals at Porto Rico were less by 94 than in 1904. There also was a targe increase in arrivals at southern ports, while a decrease is Bhown for the Pacific ports, which is accounted for in some measure by the Russian-Japanese war. or (lie Increased arrivals above re ferred to, Austria-Hungary sent 88,637 over its quota of 1904, Russia 39,756, Italy 28,183, and the United Kingdom 1*9,644. This increase from the last mentioned country, says the commis sioner, is somewhat offset by the de crease from Germany, Switzerland and Sweden. Notwithstanding the increase from Italy, (hat country, says the com missioner, may be regarded as having probably reached the high water mark. From this showing. Commissioner Sar gent ventures the prediction that the chief source of future increases in im migration are those two in Europe which have the greatest resources in population, probably, to dispense with Russia and Austria-Hungaria.
