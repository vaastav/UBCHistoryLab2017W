On the first trial it has been proven that eleven of the jurymen were bribed in the interest of the prisoner, and there hi no room to doubt but that all of the jury and the court as well, were bribed at the second trial. The evi dence was of both a positive and cir cumstantial character, and it would be difficult to got evidence more cleir and convincing, but all to n • purpose, ami the low born, rum soaked coward ly assassin goes free, and Souix City says to her grog shop keepers, when decent men oppose your business shoot them down. It will be more tolerable for Sodom in that day than for Sioux City. —Jacob Sharp’s country place, where he will probably go to rest for a spell, lies just outside of Rome, N. V., and comprises 1,500 acres, all told. The house is a handsome one, the barns large and substantial, and the walks, which cut it into plats are covered with the whitest gravel. Of course it would never do to send such a man to the penitentiary for a little thing like bribing a few naturally corrupt aldermen, so the court of ap peals has virtually set him free by granting him anew trial on some trifling tcclinacality someone Ims found in the proceedings. Sharp has evidently put some of his ready cash “where it will do the most good”. —Say, all you good fellows who make and sell beer and liquors, don’t it make you feel a little squeemish to have the Supreme Court of the United States declare the business a public nuisance and order the same abated? Come, now boys, don’t you think it is time to quit such a business and turn your attention to some honorable pur suit. Making a local application, you are a good looking, big hearted, in telligent and well informed lot ol men and well fitted for tradesmen, mech anics or the professions. Turn the key' on the nuisance business, and turn your attention and energies to something higher and nobler. —George William Curtis told the truth last week for the first time in three years. He said that he and the other mugwumps did not vote for Cleyeland because of his free trade ideas, nor yet for his civil service ideas and promises, but simply be cause it was the only way to beat Mr. Blaine, a man they did not like. Mr. ( urtis cares no more for civil service reform than a monkey does for a rotten cocoanut, but to beat Mr. Blaine, a man who Mr. Curtis cannot control, he would vote for Mr. Cleve land, the Deyil or any other man. Such is George William Curtis. —The Superior Lumber Company of Ashland is one of the largest in the United States, and W. F. Vilas, late Postmaster General, and present as pirent for the office of Secretary of the Interior, is said to be the heaviest stock holder in the concern. The company is interested in the Omaha and other lands no doubt, now in controversy, and the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior would he very important to him and his associ ates. Garland and Vilas should form a co-partnership. What a pretty pair for a presidents cabinet. —Senator Sawyer is chairman of the senate committe on post office and post roads, and is also a member of the committees on education and labor, commerce, pensions and rail roads. Senator Spooner is chairman of the committe on claims and also a member of the committees on Dis trict of Columbia, privileges and elections, and to investigate the con dition of the Potomac front. —The bum element of Sioux Cilv held a jubilee oyer the result of the Arensdorf trial, and the attorneys, Argo and Erwin, who defended the man were presented wih gold headed canes. Arensdorf, the man whom everybody believes shot Haddock, was the lion of flic evening. Such is the law decisions that breed mob violence. The President thinks the tax on tobacco ought to remain, but since the Democratic members of congress have heard from Mr. Blaine, they have been seized with a desire to place tobacco on the free li.-t. The Democratic flock does not seem to have much respect for its shepherd. —The tobacco tax amounts to S3O, 000,000 annually. Remove this and you will at the same time remove some of the burdensome surplus we hear so much about. —Mrs. John Jacob Astor died in New York hist Monday.

CAMPAIGN OPENED. President Cleveland Fires the First Gun. His to be Successor, James G. Blaine, Replies with Solid Shot The great political campaign of 1883 was formally opened last week, when on Tuesday the President’s message was read to congress. In common par lance this was the first gun fired in the great battle by the Democratic commander. Hardly had the echoes died away, when with a promptness little expected there comes across the sea from that gallant, fearless well train and general and leader of the Re publican hosts, James G. Blaine, a solid shot that turned the il ink of the enemy and set them quaking in their boots. The President in his message throws down the gauntlet of Free Trade, and Mr. Blaine is nut slow to take it up in defence of the poor and laboring classes of his country. Mr. Blaine was in Paris when the President’s message was first seen by him, and a correspondent of the New York Tri bune interviewed him immediately and sent it by cable to that paper. There is no uncertain sound, iu Mr. Blaines words and we wish we had space to give all that he said, hut we must he content with a little of it, at least for this time. He said: “I have been reading an abstract from the President’s message and have been especially interested in the com ments of tlie London papers. These papers all assume to declare that the message is a Free Trade manifesto, and evidently are anticipating an en larged market for English fabrics in the I nited .States as a consequence of the President’s recommendations. Per haps that fact stamped the character of the message more clearly than any words of mine can.” “You don’t mean actual free trade without duty?” queried the reporter. “No, no,” replied Mr. Blaine. “Nor do* the London papers mean that. They simply mean that the president recommended what is known in the United States as a revenue tariff, re jecting the protective feature as an object and not even permitting pro tection to result us an incident to re venue duties.” “I don’t know that I quite compre hend that last point,” said the report er. “I mean.” said Mr. Blaine, “that for the first time in the history of the United States the President recom mends retaining an internal tax in order that the taritf may he forced down even below the fa:- revenue standard. He recommends that THE TAX OX 

TOBACCO he retained and that many millions annually he levied on a domestic product which would far hotter come from a taritf on foreign fabrics.” “ 1 hen you mean to imply that you would fayor the repeal of the tobacco tax.” “Certainly, I mean just that,” said Mr. Blaine. “I should urge that it he done at once, even before the Christ mas holidays. It would in the first place bring great relief to growers of tobacco all oyer the country, and would, moreover, materially lessen (he price of the article to consumers. To bacco to millions of men is a necessity. The President calls it a luxury, but it is a luxury in no other sense than tea and coffee are luxuries. It is well to remember that the luxury of yesterday becomes a necessity of to-day. Watch, if you please the number of men at work on the farm, in the coal mine, on the railroad, in the iron foundry, or in any calling and you will find 65 to 100 chewing while they work. After each meal the same proportion seek the solace of a pipe or cigar. These men not only pay the millions ot the tobacco tax, but pay on every plug and every cigar an enhanced price which the tax enables the manu facturer and retailer to impose. The only excuse for such a tax is THE 

ACTI’AL NECESSITY under which the government found itself during the war and the years immediately following. To retain the tax now in order to destroy the pro duction which would incidentally flow from raising the same amount of money on foreign imports, is certainly a most extraordinary policy for onr government.” “W ell, then. Mr. Blaine, would you advise the repeal of the whisky tax also?” “No. I would not. Other condi tions than those ot financial adminis tration are to ho taken into account with regard to whisky. There is a moral side toil. To cheapen t lie price ot whisky is to increase the consump tion enormously. There would be no s n-e in urging the reform wrought by high license in many states if the national government neutralizes the good effect by making whisky within the reach of every one at 20 cents a gallon. Whisky would he everywhere distilled if the surveillance of the government were withdrawn by the remission of the tax. and illicit sales could not then he prevented even by policy as vigorous and searching as that with which llus-ia pursues the Nihilists. It would destroy high lic ense at once in all the states. Whisky has done a vast deal of harm in the I nited >?ates. 1 would try and make il do some good. I would use the tax to fortify our cities on the seaboard. In view of the powerful letter address ed to the Democratic party on the srn.iEcr ok fortifications by the late Samuel J. Tildeu in 1885, 1 am amazed that no attention has been paid to the subject by the Dem ocratic administration. Never before in the history of the world has any government allowed great cities on the seaboard, like Philadelphia, New \ork, Boston, Baltimore, New Or leans and San Francisco, to remain defenceless. W hile Mr. Cleveland would repeal the duty on wool and woolen goods, Mr. Blaine would protect and foster the wool trade and make sheep rais ing a profitable industry for the American farmer. Being asked if he thought the presidents reccomracnda tions if carried out would increase onr | export trade, he replied. “Possibly in ; some few articles of peculiar construc tion it might, hut it would increase our import trade ten fold as much in the great staple fabrics, in woolen and | goods, in iron, in steel, in all the thousands and one shape in which they are wrought. How are we to export staple.fabrics to the markets of Europe unless we make them cheaper than they do in Europe, and how are we to manufacture them ch caper than they do in Europe un less we get cheaper labor than they have in Europe?” Then you think that THE 

QUESTION OK LABOR underlies the whole subject?” “Of course it does,” replied Mr. Blaine. “It is, in fact, the entire question. Whenever we can force carpenters, masons, iron workers and mechanics in every department to work as cheaply and live as poorly in the I idled States as similar workmen in Europe, we can, of course manu facture just as cheaply as they do in England and France. But I am to tally opposed to a policy that would ebtail such results. To attempt it is equivalent to a social and financial revolution —one that would bring un told distress.” “But those holding the president’s tariff views,” remarked the reporter, “are always quoting the great pros perity of the eooiiUy under the tariff of 1846.” “That tariff did not involve the one destructive point recommended by the president, namely, the retain ing of direct internal taxes in order to abolish indirect taxes leiyed on foreign fabrics. But the country had peculiar advantages under it by the Crimean war involving England, France, and Russia and largely im pairing their tra le. All these inci dents, or accidents if you choose, were immensely stimulating to trade in the United States, regardless of the nature of onr tariff. But mark the end of this European experience with the tariff of IS Id, which for a time gave an illusory and deceptive show of prosperity. Its enactment was immediately followed by the Mexican war; then in IS4B by the great convulsions in Europe; then in 1840 and succeeding years by the enormous gold yield in California. The powers made peace in 1856, and at the time the output of gold in Cali fornia fell off. Immediately the 

FINANCIAL PANIC of 1857 came upon the country with disastrous force. Though we had in these years minded a yast amount of gold in California, every bank in New York was compelled to suspend specie payment. Four hundred millions in gold had been carried out j of the country in eight years to pay | for foreign goods that should have been manufactured at borne, and we had years of depression and distress as an atonement for our folly. “It is remarkable that President Polk recomended the tariff of 1846 on precisely the s une ground that presi dent Cleveland recommends a simi lar enactment now, namely, the stir- 1 plus in the treasury menacing ttie | prosperity of the country. History is i repeating itself. By the way,” Mr. j Blaine added, after a moment’s re- I flection, “it is worth notice that Mr. | Polk insists on emptying the treasury I by the free trade tariff, then imediate- ! ly rushed the country into debt by 1 borrowing Sl50,0o0,()00 for tlie Mex- ! ican war. I trust nothing may occur to repeat so disasterous a sequel to the policy recommended by President Cleveland. But THE 

URIFOUM FATE has been for fifty years past that the. Democrat party when it goes out of power always leayes an empty treas ury. and when it returns to power al ways finds a full treasury.” “Then do you mean to imply that there should be no reduction of the national revenue?” “No, what I have said implies the reverse. I would reduce it by a prompt repeal of the tobacco tax, ami would make here and tiicre some changes in I lie tariff—not to reduce protection, but wisely to foster it. “But what about the existing sur plus?” “ J he abstract of the message I have seen, replied Mr. Blame, “contains no reference to that point. I therefore make no comment further than to indorse Fred Grant’s remark that a surplus is always easier to handle than a deficit.” The reporter repeated the question whether the president’s recoin in nd alion would not, if adopted, give us the advantage of a large increase in exports. “1 only repeat,” answered Mr. Blaine, “that it would vastly enlarge our imports, while the only exports it would seriously increase is our gold and silver. That would flow out bounteously, just as it did under the tariff of 1864. The presidents recom mendation enacted into law would re sult, as did an experiment in drainage of a man who wished to turn a swamp into a productive field. He dug a drain to neighboring river, hut it hap pened unfortunately that the leyel of the river was higher that the level of the swamp. The consequence need not he told. A parallel would be found when (he president’s policy in attempting to open a channel for an increase of exports should simply suc ceed in making way for a deluging in flow of fabrics to the destruction of home industry.” “How will the president’s message lie taken in the South?” “I don t dare answer that question. 1 lie truth has been so long obscured by certain local questions and un reasoning prejudice that nobodv can hope tor industrial enlightenment among their leaders, just yet, hut in my view the South above all sentiona of the Inion needs protective tariffs. 4he two \ irginias, North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Ala bama and Georgia, have enormous facilities for developing and handling manufactures.

CONTKST on the question of protection. The president himself makes it the one is sue by presenting no other in his mes sage. 1 think it well to have the question settled.

The idea of “Little" Taylor for State Senator! W by, it is absurd, and lie must have the cheek of a book agent to think of it for a moment. If the party of Baron county chooses to take him up and inflict him upon the good people of that county,—very well; (hut we can’t imagine what they have done to deserve this great puni-hment), but they should have some regard for the people outside. We do not beleive he can get the delegation from Barron and if he did it would he Something lie had never done before. His friends there, if he ever had any must have fallen away from him since his legis lative experience of last winter, for of all incompetent members of that Leg islature he was a little the worst. As for the editor of the Advocate, we can only sa\ that he must he a per fect stranger to this district, and he cannot have formed any acquaintances yet but “Little” Taylor and “Liar” Swift.
