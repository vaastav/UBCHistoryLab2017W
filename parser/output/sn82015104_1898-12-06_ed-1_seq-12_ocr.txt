But one outbreak of a serious character oc curred during the year, and that among the Chippewa Indians of Minnesota, [Which, happily, has been suppressed. While it has not yet been practicable Wo enforce all the provisions of the Act of June 28, 1898, "for the protection of the people of the Indian Territory and for other purposes," it is having a sal utary effect upon the nations compos ing the five tribes. The Dawes Com mission reports that the most gratify ing results and greater advance toward the attainment of the objects of the Government have been secured in the past year than in any previous year. I cannot too strongly indorse the recom mendation of the commission and the Secretary of the Interior of the neces sity for providing for the education of Indian Territory. the 3,000 white children resident in the 

AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS. Much Accomplished by the Depart ment the Past Year. The Department of Agriculture has be. .en active in the past year. Ex plorers have been sent to many of the countries of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres for seeds and plants that may be useful to the United States, and with the further view of opening up markets for our surplus products. The forestry division of the depart ment is giving special attention to the treeless regions of our country and is introducing species especially adapted to the semi-arid regions. Forest fires, which seriously interfere with produc tion, especially in irrigated regions, are being studied, that the losses from this cause may be avoided. The department is inquiring into the use and abuse of water in many States of the West, and collecting information regarding the laws of States, the decisions of the courts and the customs of the people in this regard, so that uniformity may be secured. EXPERIMENT STATIONS. Experiment stations are becoming more effective every year. The annual appropriation of $720,000 by Congress is supplemented by $400,000 from the States. Nation wide experiments have been made to ascertain the suitable ness as to soil and climate and States for growing sugar beets. The number of sugar factories has been doubled in the last two years and the ability of the United States to produce its own sugar from this source has been clearly dem onstrated. WEATHER BUREAU SERVICE. The Weather Bureau forecast and observation stations have been extend ed around the Caribbean Sea, to give early warning of the approach of hur ricanes from the south seas to our fleets and merchant marine. THE COUNTRY'S CAPITAL. Proposed Celebration of the Cen tennial Anniversary. In the year 1900 will occur the cen tennial anniversary of the founding of CUTICURA WORKS WONDERS. $ A Remarkable Cure of Sore Eyes And Sight Restored. I am a graduate of Oberlin College, taught long enough after I graduated to have them give me the Honorary degree, and I have a great many acquaintances in and around Bos ton. About three years ago my son brought home a box of Cuticura (ointment), and I picked up the circular that-was around it, and learned about the Cuticura Soap, and told him to get me a cake. When I got it, the cir cular advised its use for the bath, teeth, scalp, etc. I had been a great sufferer all my life from sore eyelids, thewholelid outside and in was red as a beet. I had to sit in a dark room, evenings, for eight and a half years, and wear black spectacles to keep the sun from my eyes in the daytime. When I got the Cuticura Soap, 1 got a fine, soft cloth, dipped it in hot water and rubbed it on the soap and washed my eyes with it. I can't tell you how much good it has done me, although it smarted very much at first. My eyes are as clear and bright as when I was a young lady. I had to go backwards in getting spectacles and wear No. 15, the same as I did twenty years ago, 1 can read medium sized print in daylight with out any spectacles. As a matter of course lam ki nd of a walking advertisement of Cuticura. People will call to me when I am going along the street and tell me how much good my Cuticura Soap has done their eyes. Mrs. M.

A3r We take pleasure in publishing this testi monial as showing the interest taken in Cuti cura Rembdibs, and the various uses made of them not anticipated or suggested by us. We cannot, of course, anticipate how Cuticura Boap will work in cases similar to the above, but to those who desire to try it we would suggest beginning with a very weak solution or '« suds " of warm water and Cuticura Boap until its action is determined. For inflamed, granulated, or eczematous eyelids, light applications of Cu ticura ointment will in most cases be found to work wonders. Sold throughout the world. Pottib Drug ahdChem. Coup..

JOHN F. TURNER conducting sale. the city of Washington for the perma nent capital of the Government of the United States, by authority of an Act of Congress, approved July 16, 1790. In May, 1800, the archives and general offices of the Federal Government were removed to this place. On the 17th of November, ISOO, the national Congress met here for the first time, and as sumed exclusive control of the Federal district and city. This interesting event assumes all the more significance when we recall the circumstances at tending the choosing of the site, the naming of the capital in honor of the father of his country and the interest taken by him in the adoption of the plans for its future development on a magnificent scale. These original plans have been wrought out with a constant progress and a signal success even beyond any thing their framers could have fore seen. The people of the country are justly proud of the distinctive beauty and government of the capital, and of the rare instruments of science and ed ucation which heie find their natural home. A movement lately inaugurated by the citizens to have the anniversary celebrated with fitting ceremonies, in cluding, perhaps, the establishment of a handsome permanent memorial to mark so historical an occasion, and to give it more than local recognition, has met with general favor on the part of the public. I recommend to Congress the grant ing of an appropriation for this purpose, and the appointment of a committee from its respective bodies. It might also be advisable to authorize the Pres ident to appoint a committee from the country at large, which, acting with the Congressional and District of Co lumbia committees, can complete the plans for an appropriate national cele bration. CONCLUDING WORDS. Need of Amending the Alien Con tract Law Pointed Out. The alien contract law is shown by experience to need some amendment. A measure providing better protection for seamen is proposed; the rightful appli cation of the eight-hour law for the benefit of labor and of the principle of arbitration, are suggested for consid eration, and I commend these sugges tions to the careful consideration of Congress. DEPARTMENTAL REPORTS. The several departmental reports will be laid before you. They give in great detail the conduct of the affairs of the Government during the past year, and discuss many questions upon which Congress may be called upon to act.

SACRAMENTO, TtHBSDAT DECEMBER 6, 1898. Sermon at Davisville. An Americo-Spanish peace jubilee sermon was delivered by Rev. J. W. Dorrance, pastor of the Davisville Presbyterian Church on Sunday even ing last. His text was from Luke ii., 14 —"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and good will toward men." This proclamation was announced, said the pastor, by an angelic choir in the hearing of Judean shepherds on the night Christ was born. It has been wafted over seas and lands from its Oriental cradle to its Occidental throne, upon which God seems to have estab lished the scepter of righteousness w r ith which He intends to rule the nations of the earth. The center of God's operations for Christianizing the world has been transferred from Palestine to America. From Palestine God sent His servants to Christianize the nations. Now God is not only sending the nations to America to be Christianized, but He is aiding America to plant "Old Glory," the banner of religious liberty, on the islands in the midst of the sea. Within the next few days we will be celebrating the l,S9Bth birthday of the Christ, the King of Kings. Around this pivotal event in the world's his tory circle the rise and fall of many nations. During the year 1492 B. C. God rescued his chosen people from un der the iron heel of oppression and tyrannical butchery. In the year of our Lord 1492 God inclined the heart of the noble Queen of Spain to equip Christopher Columbus for that mem orable voyage over the trackless ocean in which he discovered our beloved land. The last century of America's history has been replete with incidents for thrilling recital and profound disquisi tion. We live in one of the most dis tinguished ages of the nation's exist ence. Although thirty-seven years have rolled away since the first bomb burst upon Fort Sumter, we have not forgotten the patriotic thrill that shot through the hearts of all our fellow countrymen—how that within three days a hundred thousand volunteers re sponded to President Lincoln's call for seventy-five thousand men. And then there were those anxious days and nights for four long years when we watched the wavering battle lines of two of the bravest armies that the world has ever known, as step by step, and inch by inch they contested for victory on a thousand battlefields, from Sumter to Appomattox. Neither have we forgotten the thrill of joy that peimeated every heart when the strife was ended and peace, perpetual peace amongst ourselves, was declared, and those gallant armies so quietly disbanded and exchanged their weap ons of warfare for implements of in dustry. We all remember how for the past two years our sympathy went out for the oppressed, crushed, starved and butchered Cubans by the Spaniards, who should have alleviated the suffer ing of their own offspring, instead of engendering it. How our hearts burned with sorrow at the untimely death of our sailors who perished with the Maine, and for their bereaved friends; and how the stifled sobs of the loved ones of the Maine disaster inflamed our righteous indignation for the perpetra tor of the diabolical deed, be he man, nation or devil, God knows, He to whom vengeance belongs. After all peaceful agencies had been exhausted to have Spain loose her mur derous grip upon her rebellious and helpless subjects, and our neighbors, a state of war was declared by America April 13, 1898. Then there was hurry ing to and fro across the continent of volunteers to the number of 200,000 or more, equipping of soldiers for battle; transporting them East and West over seas to the scenes and fields of carnage. And, to the wonder of the world, within the short space of 113 days, with the loss of 2.010 American soldiers in battle and in camp the Spanish Ar mada, the pride of the oceans, was sent to the bottom of the sea; Cuba made free, and Porto Rico and the Philip pines with their millions of souls gath ered by America under her wings as a hen gathers her chickens. And to-night we rejoice together be cause of the news that was flashed through the ocean from Paris that the terms of the peace protocol of August 12th last have been agreed upon by the Joint Peace Commissioners of Amer ica and Spain. Terms which make tryanny tremble and the isles of the seas rejoice. As a people who have experienced the joys and comforts which a free and in dependent nation like ours affords, we surely can with all our hearts shout and sing with the angelic host, "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." My countrymen, it now remains with us as individuals and a nation to keep Cuba free, and secure to the Porto Ricans and Filipinos the same blessings which we enjoy. THE 

BENEFIT CONCERT. A Successful Affair and a Pleasing Entertainment. The benefit concert for the Children's Day Home drew a good audience to the Congregational Church last even ing. It was a bold venture to attempt a concert in these times with two vo Powder v Pure Makes the food more delicious and wholesome ROYAL BAKINO POWER CO., NEW YORK. calists and a single instrumentalist, and one of these practically a debu tante. But it is to be said that the di rectress, Miss Nourse, successfully ac complished the feat, with herself the only woman on the bill. She has not, we believe, before been heard here in concert. A native of this city, she is still another witness to the fact that Sacramento possesses far more of musical ability than most com munities of like size. Her voice is a promising soprano, as yet rather cold and lacking in maturity; that is to say, there is room for development. But it is a voice of great clearness, sweet, and of remarkable volume for so fragile a body. Miss Nourse has the throat of a singer; her method is wholly devoid of mannerisms; her style is good, but will broaden, and confidence with ex perience will bring with it warmth. It is not to be understood that the voice is now unexpressive. Quite the con trary; but there is lack of freedom and assertion which is to be expected in so young and comparatively untried a singer. She sings now with tenderness, simplicity and ease altogether charm ing, but she will acquire force and vigor without losing the other quali ties, for the reserve power of her voice is unquestioned. She has every reason to be satisfied with her success last night. Her reception was very cordial and flattering. If her audience was not roused to enthusiasm, it was certainly well pleased, and went away confident of the young singer's capacity to fill expectations along the line of much higher achievement. Dr. H. J. Stewart's high standing as an organist renders comment upon his numbers superfluous. It must suffice to say, as has so often been said of him, that he is master of the instrument and a thoroughly accomplished and highly finished musician. His most ef fective number was the Chopin's "Pol onaise in A," but he carried the au dience by storm on a recall wi h the daintiest, most delicately played lit of composition ever heard from the orgaa over which he presided last evening, when he- gave the delightful "Gavote" from "Mignon." 'Frank Coffin, the well known tenor has too often appeared in Sacramento to make any analysis of his art neces sary now. He was in good voice and sang with entire satisfaction to the au dience, which manifested its pleasure in an unmistakable manner. All in all, it was a successful concert; not a great one, and rather a monotone as to themes, but for all that an entertain ment of an excellent order. 

INDEPENDENT FORESTERS. Address by High Chief Ranger Mc- Elfresh Last Night. Under the auspices of Court Sierra a union meeting of the Courts of Inde pendent Foresters of this city was hold in Independent Order of Foresters' Hall last evening, where a large num ber of the membership gathered to greet High Chief Ranger G. A. Mc- Elfresh of the Jurisdiction of Califor nia. After the regular business of the evening (during which L. H. Irvine was made a Forester-at-Sight) was disposed of, the distinguished visitor took possession of the meeting and for more than an hour entertained those present by explaining the changes in the constitution of the order. High Chief Ranger McElfresh be came eloquent in his remarks. He is a master at his business as a promoter of safe fraternal life insurance, and is thoroughly informed as to all phases of the question. Plis explanations on the subject are very clear, lucid and enlightening. After adjournment a nice lunch was partaken of and a general social time had. Funerals Yesterday. The funeral of James B. Sayre, the well-known harness dealer, took place yesterday from his late residence, 1615 O street, many friends following his remains to the grave. Mr. Sayre had been in business in this city for many years and was held in high esteem. Besides his wife he leaves a son and daughter, William A. Sayre and Mrs. Emma Barrett. He was a native of Canada and 03 years of age. There was a large attendance yes terday at the funeral of the late Mrs. Charles Schepp from the family resi dence at 1"»24 N street. Rev. C. F. Oehler officiated. A wealth of beauti ful flowers were sent by friends to adorn the grave. The pall-bearers were Thomas Baker, Judge S. E. Gandy, J. Gruhler, Fred Rink, A. Gonders and John Wunda. Weather Reports. The Weather Bureau reports shew the highest and lowest temperatures yesterday to have been 02 and 39 de grees, with gentle northerly winds and partly cloudy weather prevadling. The barometrical readings at 5 a. m. and 5 p. m. yesterday were 30.12 and 30.10 inches, respectively. The highest and lowest temperatures one year ago yesterday were 54 and 38 degrees, and one year ago to-day G2 and 44 degrees, with a trace of rain. The average temperature was 50 de grees and the normal 49 degrees, show ing yesterday to have been 1 degree warmer than usual for the sth day of December. River, 8 feet 7 inches. Sent to Whittier. Judge Hart yesterday sentenced Mag gie Corcoran, an incorrigible fourteen year-old girl, to the WhiMier School, where she will remain till she is of age. He also sentenced Ross Powers, a tough youth arrested at Folsom, for an assault on a young girl, to the same institution. Forest Protection on Pacific Coast. The Pacific Coast forests are not •'in exhaustible"—far from it—but, with proper use and care, they should equal to the future needs of home and foreign consumption. The forests now standing are mature, and are not bet tered by not being cut. At least ninety per cent, of the cut-over lands are of absolutely no value for agricultural purposes. They are adapted only to timber growing. Moreover, the native species, if protected from fire, are, as a rule, readily and quickly reproduced. The lumber industry is legitimate and necessary business, despite certain sen timentalists; moreover, if properly man aged, its future has more in store for the Pacific Coast than all that her gold fields have yielded.—F. H. Lamb, in The Engineering Magazine,

Dreyfus is living at present at j Chalcu, a suburb of Paris a little way ] down the Seine. I was calling by ap- 1 pointment. and had waited but a few seconds when Mme. Drei-fus entered the room into which I had been shown. I had expected a face worn by suffering, a presence that would speak to the anguish endured. There was some thing of this, but it is only after close inspection that it is possible to divine the unspeakable strain which Mme. Dieyfus has supported for years At th« first blush you are astonished at her air of cheerfulness, at the almost happy and infinitely kindly smile that plays over her handsome features. "I must keep a cheerful face, if only for the sake of the children," Mme. Drey fus explained to me in answer to con gratulations on her appearance. '-The idea that such a man could be a traitor is toe silly. His' whole nature was op pcsio to everything that is underhand and shifty. All those who know him are aware how he detested intrigue, how frank he was. how incapable of furthering his own interests by re course even to the petty dissimulation that is so often tolerated in everyday life." Captain Dreyfus' letters to his wife were shown to the interviewer. It ' shculd be explained that Mme. Dreyfus does not receive the originals of the letters, which are sent in the first place to the central prison authorities, who have them copied: it is these copies that reach her toward the 15th of <\ieh mcnth. Needless to say, there is noth ing to prevent the authorities making whatever suppressions they choose, and it is certain that they have made exten sive use of this right. In one of these th* ex-Captain writes: "It is again to you that I write, for you are the only thread that still binds me to life. I know that all my family" and all yours as well. love and esteem me, but after all, if I were to disappear their sorrow, great though it is, would vanish in time. It is solely the thought of you, my poor darling, that enables me to struggle on. It is the thought of you that keeps me from suicide. How all my love for you comes home to me at this moment! Never before naa it been more immense—more exclusive. I still cherish a slight hope of rehabili ating my name, but res* assured that If I am successful in treading this „7al vary to the end, it will be uniquely for your sake, my poor darling; it will be to avoid you a fresh sorrow in addition to a-\ those you have already supported." His only solace is the thought of these he loves. "All around me is the meat profound silence, only broken by the moaning of the sea. Traversing the distance that separates us I transport myself in thought amid you. amid all those who are dear to me, and whose thoughts, I know, often go forth to me. Frequently, at this hour or that I ask myself what my dear I.'icie is doing, and in my mind I send her the echo of my immense affection. I then close my eyes, and there seem to pass before me your figure and those of my dear children. Do not weep, then, dearest, I will struggle to the >a>t minuite for your sake and that of my j children." For four long , years Mme. Dreyfus hits striven to convince the universe of her husband's innocence, and. a harder task still, to bring home the suspicion to the authorities of her own country that a hideous injustice had been per petrated. The miracle has come to pass. To-day Mme. Dreyfus is confi dent that her final triumph is only a question of time. T asked her what, in her opinion, was the explanation of the calamity that had overtaken her husband "I think," she answered, "I still think, in srite of all that has happened, that me origin of our trouble was a mistake I cannot. I will not, believe that an in nocent victim was intentionally singled out. By a strange and terrible freak of chance there was some resemblance \ DO NOT
