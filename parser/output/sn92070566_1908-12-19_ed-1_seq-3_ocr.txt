Already in full cry, in pur suit of t lie new gods. A beau tiful and glowing tribute to the chivalry of the politician. But fortunately for Mr. Koosevelt, it is not left to us to pass in final judgment of his usefulness or bigness. Posterity, that can see with clear, impartial view, will give to the man his proper place i nn,M,nl He i- tor, hi. too forceful too energetic, and has accomplished too much to have failed to make occasional errors, but our grandchildren will revere his memory as one of the big presidents. Certainly not in a class with Mr. Lincoln, because ho lacks the balance, the equipoise, the bigness of heart, the greatness of soul which characterized Mr. Lincoln: but nevertheless Mr. Koosevelt has been, is now, and will forever be regarded, one ot the big presidents.

They find the saving in time alone more than offsets the cost of electricity to operate them. We put these irons out on :il days free trial, and guarantee them absolutely for one year.
