Inas much as these committees were overhauled last spring, there will be but few changes made, and these mainly to accommodate newly-elected Sen ators. The movement to restore Sumner to the Chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Commit tee is practically dead. Cameron Is so vain of his new position that bo desires to keep it, and he will be sustained by tho same votes which elected him last spring. Senator Trumbull has Buggestedlhat the Retrenchment Committee be revived, and there is considerable talk of adopting this suggestion and putting Schurz in .as Chairman. There has been considerable com- plaint, lately, against tho Pacific Railroad Com ■ miuoc, and its abolition is recommended. It is asserted that the necessity for this committceno pn. longer exists, and that its reputation for fair all pub...mg is not so good that it can he continued selves. 3Jyas an ornament. cicct r?-« CHICAGO PUBLIC BUILDINGS. i'lr.

POSTAL BILLS. jßfclr. FABNSWORTH ,from the Post Office Com mittee, reported a bill to revise, consolidate ami amend the statute relating to the Post O r -ie De partment. He stated that it was the same bill which passed the House at the lust Congress The postal laws had never been codified since the organization of the department, and many of them had become obsolete, while others were contradictory and difficult of explanation. The clerk proceeded to read the hill, which is very voluminous. THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. The reading of the bill was interrupted by the expiration of the morning hour, when the House went into Committee of ihe Whole on tho Presi dent's message. The usual resolutions distribut ing poitlons of the message among appropriate comi .ixteess were offered by Mr, DAVIS, and adopted. Before a vote was taken, Mr. 

WOOD inquired whether tliere was any such committee as the Committee on Insurrectionary States ? . Mr. DAWES replied that there was a committee which went by that name, and which was raised last-session for the purpose of considering tho subject which it was now proposed to refer to it— HieKu-Klux outrages, _ - Yr. WOOD said this committee was brought iu-iri-dl.-iHxistenco for the purpose of visiting ihe States to do certain things. When that had reported to tho House it hud no Xo/hluin-.-f functions. He was, therefore, opposed to' hgit for a whole Congress in this eurrep comm k-i manner. .Tip EoF-DAWES stated, to reply to Mr. Wood, that iirrrh °®' UlUii toe was coustltut- JljTi,.

He had seen enough [j.« in ii select committees to consider special i .Vo '/m w He remembered that when tho urat '.! rut apl YOLTJME 25. Pacific Baflroad committee was CRtablished. tha Speaker of the House made it up iu. the interest of the road, and that the committee traa prepared to give asray all the land of the nation. p cparc<l ilr. FARHSWOKTH moved that the snhiect he referred to the Post Office Committee m So £ iSo.?«P« r Jurisdiction, 'if. HAWES said this was a crent mihiApt •»»». tlj >* i of consideration country and the lC ev^i?t« b & *, orc 5 d upon ‘to consideration by the events and tendencies of the ago. If any i ‘, , “ g , r i C .,' lUI . r(:d a Bp f clal conunlttee, which would L, S? l i!V;; T t0 . CB ?' iltl " 11 rully, It was this subject. Mr.MBLACK suggested that the project would cntalllmioeneepntronage on the administration, “Avo, the appointment of at least %take charge of tho telegraphic ousmesi, wnieh fact made the pioposition an ap palling one to him, and would control hia vote against It. Mr. FARNSWORTH understood that it was pro posed to Incori>orulo with every coosecuti ve Post Office in the country a telegraph office, and to muho every Postmaster a telegraph operator, or elseLto appoint an expert to operate tho tele graph. The government would tuu} have cogni zance of all private, coutidential, and linaaoial business of the people. Every member of Con gress would be Importuned by his constituents to make their Post Office a telegraph station. The Post Office Committee had been appointed with out reference to This subject, and might there fore he presumed as fair as one appointed specially. He was willing to admit that he hud gone over tho whole subject, aud was against tho proposed measure. Tho success of the system iu Urcat Britain or any thickly-settled old country, ■where no new Post Office had been established for fifty years, formed no criterion for this coun try. Tho whole thing was monstrous iu any way It could bo regarded. Mr. BANKB remarked that the question of ocean cables was in tho jurisdiction of tho For eign Committee, and moved that that point be stricken from the pending resolution. •Mr. DAWES assented, and the resolution was so modified. Mr. BANKS thought it best for the Interests of tho country to avoid special committees when ever there was a permanent standing committee to whom a subject could bo referred. Mr. BECK, member of the special committee of the last Congress, said the cost aud effect of the project had been understated. There were now five thousand stations In tho country, with 77 000 miles of line and 7,000 employes. Under the gov ernment plan there would be at least 20,000 tele graph offices, 150,000 miles of lino, and 25,000 em ployes. He believed the proper committee was that of Appropriations, who would bo careful in recommending anything that would take from the people not $36,000,000, but nearly 570,000.000. He clidnotbelieve.that committee would over sanc tion such a scheme, or even consider it for a mo ment. Mr. RANDALL wished to stop thia sohemo of plunder at the threshhold. Ho was informed that originally the whole of tho telegraph lines did not cost over two or three millions, and now the com pany hud the affrontcry to ask Congress to take us property at the present appreciated value. He would oppose the scheme, because it would place the whole private andbusiness transactions of tho people under the scrutiny of government officials. He hoped tho House would squelch tho thing ut once. Mr. 

DAWES did not understand that any pro ject was rccommeuued. The statement by Mr. Randall, that the telegraph company asked Con gress to purchase its property at an enormous rate, showed that the gentleman did not under stand the relations of tho mutter more than a baby. Tho Western Union Company was array ing itself, with all its power and influence, against any such proposition. Mr. BECK remarked that while tho Western Union Company opposed the project in the last Congress, ho under«toodtbal it had changed its position, and now’ Is anxious for it. Mr. DAWES said . that fact did not commend the matter to his approval, but this is not the lime to enter upon tho merits of tho whole sub ject. After further discussion by' Messrs. PALMER and GARFIELD in favor, and Messrs. CONNOR and KING against a special committee, it was re- Itired-r-ico tv 98 —to tho Committee on Appro priations. TUB NEW LOAN. Mr. COX moved the reference of the portion of the message relative to the now loan to the Com mittee on Bunking. Rejected, and the subject left to tho B aya and Means Committee. RESIGNATION. The commltte rose, when the resignation of Mr. Washburn, of Mussachueects, was presented. LABOR BUREAU. A resolution was adopted for an inquiry into the expediency of an establishment of a Labor Bureau in connection with the Department of Ag riculture, with a view to the compilation of sta tistics, and more complete recognition of the rights of the laboring classes.

The Journal of to-morrow will contain a sensa tional correspondence from Clark County about tbe late hanging of three negroes charged with the murder of the Park family hy a mob. The letter says that the negroes were iunoceut of the crime, and that they were hung because of the prejudice existing against their race in the neighborhood, which is strongly Democratic. The letter infers that some members «f the mob are not only responsible for the death of the negroes, but that they aro really the ones guilty of the Park murder. The corres pondent promises more developments soon. Telegraphic Brevities.

Special Despatch to The Chicago Tribune. HOUSE REVENUE DILL. W Springfield, ILL, Dec. 6.—Tho Revenue bil came up in the House to-day, and Mr. Short mad a very lucid explanation of its provisions, which was listened to with much attention. Some -of tho provisions of the bill relative to taxing mon eys, etc., have not his approval, but tho majority of tho committee favored them. An. attempt to wait until tho Stenato Revenue bill came to them in on amended form, and give the House bill the go by, was almost unanimously yoted down, and there is very little question that some time or' other the House will pass Short’s bill in about lt« present form. An attempt was made to strike out tho provision by which - tho residents are compelled to list for tax ation, all personal property outside of tho Stito, hut it was so decidedly beaten as to indicate that there is little chanco of bettering the harsher pro visions of the hill. Tho afternoon was consumed in tho discussion of the exemption section, to which public libraries were added, but attempts to specify other things which are covered by tho bill os it Is, like parks, was defeated. 

CHICAGO EYE AND EAR INFIRMARY. Tlio Senate, to-day, passed the bill making ap propriation for the Chicago Eye and Ear Inttrma ry. There is no objection to ic In the House.

Three classes are made, tho first con taining 20,000, the second between 20,000 and 70,000, and the third exceeding 70,000, which is in Cook County only. The fees of 1815 were aiopted as a maximum lor first-class or counties where tho heaviest fees are allowed, and reduced de cidedly for second oud third classes. CAMPBELL’S COUNCIL BILL. ■When Campbell’s bill to create au upper House in Chicago comes up, an amendment will be offered to divide the city- into six compact dis tricts. and elect three Councillors from each, by minority vole. COOK COUNTY BILLS. There arc now so many special orders on tho calendar that it is hard to tell when tho Cook Coun ty bills will be reached. It does not now seem as il any would be passed before Christmas. RECORDING IN COOK COUNTY The following is the bill introduced by Senator Woodard on the subject of Recording in Cook County,to which there seems to bo no objection in the Senate. AN Act to red* co the fees of Clerks of Circuit Courts (who arc cx-ojfie(o Recorders of Deeds) la comities containing a population of seventy thousand and up. ward, and infix a compensation lor said Clerks; uud to provide for the payment of all fees, perqui. sites, and emoluments, above the amount of said compensation, into tho County Treasuries.' Section 1. Me it enacted by the People of the State oj JUtnoit, rejrretmted in the General Ag*emblu, That hemdter the Clerks of tho Circuit Courts, (who are ca-opicto Recorders of Deeds), aud In counties contain me a population of seventy thousand and upward, which shall bedoaignatedaa counties of the third clou, shall be allowed the following fees, viz.: ForroconlW tul deeds, mortgages, powers of attorney, or other in. struments of writing, or making any copy thereof, for every one hundred wonts. o cents ; ami no fee shall be allowed for indexing and filing. fcEC. 2. All fees, or allowances, received by said clerks. In excess of *2.600, which sura Is hereby fixed as a full Compensation for tho yearly salary of said ofii cer, shall be paid Into tho County Treasuries. SEC. 3. ; The number of tho Deputies and assistants of said Clerk shall bo determined by rule of the Circuit Court, to lie entered of record, and their compensation shall be determined by tho County Board: Provided, that said compensation shall be paid out of. and never exceed, the fees of the office actually collected. 5-r.c. -i . All laws or pans of laws coufiicUug with tho provisions of this act are hereby repealed. feEC. 5. By reason of tho destruction of the records of deeds in one or more counties, of the class herein designated, and which records must bo restored at u great and unnecessary expense, as the fees are now* used by law, an emergency exists, requiring that this act should co into effect immediately; therefore this act shall take effect and bo in force from and after its passage. FEES AND SALARIES. It appears to be the intention of the House Committee on Fees and Salaries to prepare one bill which shall cover the entire subject entrusted to them. Therein, they will fix all salaries from those of the Governor down, and will regulate fees of every officer in the Stole. There is no doubt that it la much better to have the whole matter embraced In one act. It makes a much better appearance, and la decidedly more conven ient, but there is a question of expediency -to bo settled. It will bo exceedingly difficult to pass such a bill, for the reason that it concentrates such an amount of opposition and will tako so much time to be passed. By breaking up this bill into ten, each covering but a few officers. Ibis op position is greatly divided abd weakened, and some of these bills will pass without a contest, and sqmethingwillhavc been done on the subject. It is the choice between half a loaf at once, or the possibility of no loaf at all, a choice which is constantly recurring in legis lation. The Senate has decided to do something at oneq. The House Committee proposes to do something hereafter. ‘Whether the House will sustain them, it is as yet impossible to say. Mr. Sullivan introduced a bIU this morning to to regulate fees of county officers, dividing coun ties into six classes, whereas the constitution ap pears to coniine the number of classes which the Legislature can make to three. LOST RECORDS. Of the two bills introduced this morning by Mr. King, of Cook, Uio one in regard to restoring records, was prepared by a committee embrac ing among its members Judge J. M. Wilson and I. If. Arnold. This bill, which is very long, provides for the appointment by the Governor of a commission; who shall procure, by purchase or otherwise, from abstract men or others, all the evidences of title they enn, and have them recorded. The bill further provides a form of proceeding, beginning with u petition Hied by the owner of the property. The other bill is drawn up by the Hon. Emory Washburn, and also provides for the appointment of Coimulsslon crh. LIGHTHOUSES. A letter to Governor Pahuor from Colonel O. M. Poe, on duty with the Lighthouse Board, shows the importance of immediate action by the State to give the Federal Government power to obtain land in this State. An appropriation was made last year for a lighthouse near Evanston, and the board are ready to go on with the work when they can secure the laud. If they do not begin by June 30 the appropriation will lapse. ABSENTEES. The House was remarkably full this morning, the only Cook County absentees being Dixon, Humphrey, and Easter.

The Revenue bill was resumed, and Mr. Short continued hia explanation of its provisions, with some of winch, relative to taxing money, &c., he la not in accord. The provision doing away with the Shoe Board of Equalization, he defended. P faifr «d the way In which Mr. SHORT had made his report on the revenue, and stated the principles of his bill, which was far briefer than the old law. * lie believed that real property should bear its burdens and pre vent heavy impositions as personal property, and the Inquisitorial way in which they were made. Nothing should be done in forcing men to dis close their business to the public. Ho approved of the idea of holding out inducements to manu facturers by rather relieving them from taxa tion, and of relieving foreign insurance com panies from taxation, so as to bring In foreign capital. Mr. SPRINGER said the Senate committee bad outdone ther Revenue bill, until it was briefer than the House bill. Ho therefore suggested that action be postponed, until the Henuto bill was received, and taat the House amend that.

Mr. CUMMINGS moved to strike out the pro vision taxing personal property belonging to resi dents of the State kept or used temporarily out of the State. Mr. SPRINGER opposed the amendment, since people living on the borders of the Stale would bank outside of the State, and their property would escape taxation. Mr. CUMMINGS wanted to tax only property within the State, for that was all they could con trol. Mr. JOHNSON opposed tho amendment, since the people along the Mississippi transferred per sonal property to liwa to escape tax. Tho amendment was lost. The exemption list was read. Mr. KING, of Cook, offered an amendment specifically exempting from taxation school lauds of cities,towns and villages; the bill exempting only school lauds belonging to tho State or county. Aftera long discussion the amendment was adopted, which satisfied Mr. King. A motion was made to exempt public libraries. Mr. SULLIVAN moved to modify by exempting free public libraries. This was opposed since there were none in the State. After a long dis cussion, and some fighting, Air. Sullivan's amend ment was lost. Air.

Mr. SHORT opposed the amendment, and Mr. DANIELS defended it. thinking the man who owned a farm should deduct his debt which was allowed iu listing moneys and credits. The section was postponed, to be considered with the section relative to moneys and credits. ASYLUM. ADJOUBN3IENT. The committee rose, and will sit again to moi row' morning.

C., Dec. s.—ln the Ku-Klur trial to-day, Stanbcrry, for the defence, moved to quash the indictment against Crosby and others, upon the grounds that the persona injured are not mentioned in the indictment; that the grand inry had decided as to the law instead of the facts; • that the Indictment was defective, staling a deprivation of tho right to vote as,taking place at a future date; that the constitution and laws do not secure any citizen the right to vote, and that tho State, not the Fed eral Courts, must redress tho personal grievances complained of.

Paris, Dec. 5.—A bill authorizing an Increase in the circulation of tho Bank of Franco will be introduced in tho Assembly, probably this week. The National Assembly effected an‘organiza tion to-day, by re-electing President Grevy and the Vice Presidents of tho last session. The report that Thiers had sent u message to tho Assembly was premature, although its con tents are known. It has not yet been receivedor published. It is rumored that Thiors withholds the- document because ho is averse to declaring himself in favor of the admission of tho Orleans Princes to tho Chamber, and some avowal on this point is expected in the forthcom- mg message, more especially as it is supposed that ho has received notification that the Princes intend to, claim their right to seats us iegally cJeeted representatives of the people. Tho status of the Orleans Princes promises to be ono of tho leading questions before thq Assembly. Bills restoring to them their contlscatod estates and all their rights as citizens of France arc preparing, and will bo introduced at an early duy. It is anticipated that those measures will give rise to long and exciting de bates. Tho extreme left wing will meet tliom with propositions for a general amnesty, which, setting tree the thousands of Communists still hem prisoners in the hulks and elsewhere, will be considered only an equitable compliment of the act of Justice proposed to be done to tho house of Orleans.

Paris, Dee. s—Evcning-Thiers appears to have up his mliul to oppose tho admission of the Orleans Princes to tho National Assembly, for tho Princes to-duy waited upon Thiers for the purpose of listening to an exposition of tho reasons influencing him against their taking scats in the Legislature, and of endeavoring by argument to change his decis ion. Tho President received tho Princes courte ously, but, owing to tho pressure of public busi ness. was unable to hear or reply to them to-day. He, however, appointed an interview for Friday next, at which time lie will be prepared to de velop fully his reasons for restraining them from taking seats in tho Assembly.

New York, Dec. s.—The rates for money open ed easy at cto 7 per cent, but toward the close of hank hours tho market became more active, and stock brokers freely paid 7 per cent in coin. Currency Is leaving tbo city for the cotton and pork-packing sections, but not in sufficient vol ume to cause tho present activity in' tho market nor to neutralize the effect of the Treasury coin disbursements, which within a week have now run up to $10,000,000, simply on account of the redemp tion of the 5-203. Tho real oauae of the activity is that about $4,000,000 of legal-tenders have boon locked up by speculators for a decline in prices on the Stock Exchange. 

GOLD sold at 110 this afternoon for tho first time this year. This morning efforts were made to break It, but they failed, and this afternoon two brokers combined and accomplished tbo object long desired by tho bears. A largo number of bets were ponding on the result, and tbo price was kept at the lowest point long enough to make assurance doubly sure. As soon as 110 was marked on tho Indicator the excitement broke oat, nud was accelerated by a rush of operators to tho room. A large num ber of orders had been lying in abeyance, waiting for this point to bo reached, and instantly bids were made on all sides, and in largo amounts. Some few lots were purchased, but tho stiffness of the price prevented the filling of many of the orders. At one time the quotation was 109 7*B, but no actual sales weie made under 110.
