George A. i-ightfoot told his story to the reporters in the office of '.he Lightfoot Gold Dredging Oesßpany. at No. r>2 Broadway. "I thought Lossbj would repudiate hi? affidavit." he said, 'if it t was false, for I kn'v }.<• wa« "broke."

Exact date will be given in later announcements. THE VA^UVWA SHIJWG TOJV l^m The Tribune Bureau.! Washington. Dec. 17.— The continued at tacks on Secretary Balllnger, and over his fchoulders on the administration, are the occanion of grave anxiety to the members Of President Taffs Cabinet, many of whom see in them additional evidence of the movement to discredit the Taft adminis tration and bring about a situation which might compel the nomination of Mr. Roose velt in 1312. The members of the Cabinet deeme.l the evidences of the existence of such a movement of sufficient importance to lay them before the President on his re turn from his Western trip, as was told In these dispatches at that time, and events have served only to confirm the opinion they then entertained. President Taft. who supposed his exoneration of Secretary Bal- Unger. made public last September, would mi an end to the whole controversy and prevent further publication of such charges, has grown so FenMtlve on the subject that few members of the Cabinet care to risk his displeasure by bringing It to his at tention. Mr. Taft refuses to read a.l news paper and magazine articles on the subject, dismisses everything dealing with the polit ical end of his administration with impa tience, and his advisers are forced to the conclusion that he has little idea of the extent or far-reaching influence of the con troversy. . , The latest changes against Secretary Bal linger. in so far as they are charges, can easily b» disproved, although the simplest liMtiasi requires many words of explanation, pud such explanations make dry reading. In the main, however, there are no <leflnlt« charge, s'mp'y a series of statements placed in such connection as clearly to con vey an iden without stating a fact. This style of apparently succinct statements nislrrs Interesting reading, effectively con \•.. r the implication and obviates asser tions which would be distinctly libellous. For Instance, these sentences follow each ether "Alexander McKensJe, of N<>rt:, Dakota, was the captain of this filibustering enterprise. I'onald K. McKen/.ie Is on>- of the chief conspirators in the present at tempted steal." The implication is clear that the two IfcKanzles are It; pome w;i\ rrlated, although that statement is nut rr.ide. As a .matter of fa ft, they are not related either a« kindred or In business. Many other statements of like character rrigtit be cited. Advices from Vice-Consul Caldera, at Managua, that rioting and 'violence are in creaslng in the Nlcarapuan capital, that Zelaya's supporters are armed with knives and revolver? and that a number of Americans have appealed to the legation for protection have been followed by in structions ' to Admiral Kimball to proceed to Corinto with seven hundred marines, to Mr. Caldera and other consular representa tives of this country to communicate di rectly with the commanders of American Fhlps In case, of need, and to those com manders to take all measures necessary for the protection of American interests. It is expected, therefore, that early advices from Xicaraeua Will tell of the landing of Amer ican armed forces on Nicaraguan soil. No Importance whatever is attached to Ze laya's communication to President Taft quoting a message lie says he seiit on De cember 4. to his special emissary, Gonzales. No such messaee was received by the Pres ident or by Secretary Knox. and grave doubt Is entertained regarding the truthful ness of Zelayas latest communication. Be«or Creel presented his credentials to President Taft to-day. but no information reearding the purport of his conversation with the Executive was given. The Committee on Paciflr Islands and Porto Rico, of which Senator Depew Is chairman, gave an extended hearing to day to the members of the reformers" con clave, who seek the enactment of a law prohibiting the sale of Intoxicating liquors In Hawaii. John <». Woolley. of the Anti- Saloon l,en>;iie of Hawaii, described the popular Hawaiian drink, 'dago red." which delectable beverage is composed of i ologne spirits and red wine It sells at whole sale for IS cents and at retail for fin cents a gallon. Mr. Woolley de. lured that a gal lon was sufficient to keep two families drunk for two days. At cording to Iff! Woolley, the sale of liquor to the common people was prohibited under royal rule in t] c is'ar.d. but since its annexation to the T'nlted States the liquor interests "exer full BWing." He insisted, moreover, that a prohibition law was necessary to make the anti-canteen law effective so far us American soldiers In the Island are (onccrned. Representative Frank Lowden, of Illinois.

XEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNE. SATURDAY. DECEMBER 18. 1900. command wide newspaper publicity. There are always too few Senators of that type to meet the demand, and a superabundance of those who neglect committee duties and hard work arid devote their time to tlie sensational and the spectacular with the hope of Raining personal advertising. Sen ator Flint says he should have devoted more years to accumulating a fortune, having done which he could have served in the Senate as long as his state dcsi r ed. Congress has lost some of Its most valua ble members because they entered public life too soon, and were later obliged to recoup their personal resources, of which tlere lies been no more striking illustra tion than that of Senator John C.

Theoretically, ( 'ongress should not be n "millionaire*' club," but it is useless to refuse <o recognize t';e fact that the men who can render the ablest servfeo to the government can Invariably gain a far greater Income in private life, and the further fact that conditions are such that the man with high ideals and without an Independent and considerable fortune can not be happy In the Inited States Senate. G. G. H. MILLARD COMPANY INDICTED. Held Responsible for Accidents in Erie Cut, at Jersey City. An indictment against the Millard Con struction Company, of Philadelphia, for maintaining a public nuisance In Jersey City was found by the Hudson County Grand Jury yesterday. The company is ex cavating a cut for the Erie Railroad through Jersey City Heights and many serious accidents have resulted there dur ing the last two years from r '.*k blasting. The Indictment carries with it punishment by a heavy fine and is the result of a raid made on the cut by Fk-rre P. Garven, Pros ecutor of the Pleas of Hudson County, who placed under arrest one of the officers and seventeen employes of the company, charg ing them with maintaining a nuisance, und had them held for the grand jury. The officers of the company aro J. H. Louch heim. president and general maiiaK ol ". Ar thur Loeb. vice-president und genera) man ager of the Erie cut work. Senator Jaim's P.

POLITICIAN IN FEAR OF DEATH. W. F. Lynan Tells Brooklyn Coroner of Mysterious Assault. Fearing that he was likely to (Iron dead at any moment, William P. I,ynan yester day paid a visit to Coroner Brewer, of Brookiyn. l.ynan liad two of Ins riiis broken one night last week. He is a po litical ally of Martin P. t only, from whom John J. Bridges wrested the Democratic control of the 2d Assembly District of Kings County. Being out of the city it the last primaries Lynan did not vote, and tie Conlyites imagined that he had voted against thi'lr leader. On the night in question, according to Lynan, he was assaulted by several men. The following Sunday he v« nt to St. Catharine's Hospital, where, he said, the doctors did not seem ablo to tind the trou ble Yesterday morning, he s;iid, he was hardly able to move, and, fearing sudden death, he determined to make a statement to the Coroner. Coroner Brewer sent Lynan, who lives at No. 151 Sands street, to the Long Island College Hospital, where It was found that two of his ribs on the rl^ht si<le were broken. , Do You Know What An Excellent PIANO $195 Will Buy? .* And FIRST PAYMENT Need Not Be Made Until February First •J Tins is a piano that any family may be proud to own, refined and beautiful in architectural construction and finish. It is a piano so excellent in tone and action that ii is constantly being commended by music teachers, who tell us that it is radically dif ferent in character from the usual instrument sold at $200. «jj So one is more discouraged than the musk teacher if the piano tone is not right; for the teacher, more than anyone else, realizes how important it is that the students ear should he trained to be familiar with true musical tone. «I In securing such a piano as the J.

W., Dec. 17.— Business h»* l)»en so demoralised by the coal strike that the legislature took the drastic step to-day of passing a bill rendering both strike lead ers and employers who Instigate or aid a strike, or lockout liable to a year's Impris onment. Washington, Dec. 17.— Samuel Gompersi president of the American Federation of Labor, pointed out to-day the failure of compulsory arbitration In New Bsfjsjnd to prevent strikes, with the accompanying Inference that laws making arbitration compulsory In the United states would not operate differ-ntly. He said to-day: When New Zealand and New South Wales adopted their compulsory arbitration laws, faddists declared that strikes would not again occur in those countries. Observ ing men said that the lawsSvould be Inef fective and abortive, and no • they have proved themselves. Compulsory arbitration which compels employers to pay higher wages than they think they can affoid and enforces that award by the power of gov ernment results In confiscation of prop erty. Compulsory arbitration which awards a lower wage and imposes conditions upon workmen repugnant ti» them and enforces it by the power of . government, -establishes involuntary servitude— slaver r. :• The attempt in the New >So"uth Wales legislature to send men to pTVson for en gaging in or encouraging a strike- will prove equally abortive to their first at tempts at compulsory arbitration. :As lons as the workers have aspiration's foe a bet ter life and concept of the rights which are Justly theirs, they will unite and continue their efforts for their attainment. When they cannot be secured, without a strike they will have no hesitancy In. striking, Jail or no jail. :• • <*< ■•« : >. . •'■;■•■. \ • .■ ''.*■'' ' """'' •' ' ■
