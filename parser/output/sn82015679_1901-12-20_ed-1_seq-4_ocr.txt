This weather and the condition of the coal market will so to convince the people of Indianapolis that another railroad into the coal fields would be a good thing to have. So Senator Burton, of Kansas, will not In sist on the appointment of his relative to the ofHce of postmaster in an Indiana town. The remarkable thing about It is that he should have ever thought of it. President Gompers declares that trusts, meaning Industrial combinations, are all riht if they keep their hands out of poli tics. In fact, under such conditions he welcomes them as Industrial factors. A Philadelphia paper says that two large cargoes of American agricultural Imple ments will soon be shipped from that city to Russia, one cargo going to a port on the Baltic and the other to a city on the Black sea. The doors seem to be opening to American trade In all directions. Persons who are seeking positions as teachers in the Philippines should not de ceive themselves as to conditions there. Although the salaries offered seem liberal, the expenses of living are 50 per cent, higher than here, ar-d there are other draw backs which it requires considerable mis eionary zeal to overcome. The Atlanta Constitution says that South ern Republicans do not like the new post master general. If they do not, the reason Is on the surface, and it Is that he made a ftrenuous effort to place representation In national Republican conventions on the basis of votes polled. To-day tho mass of Republicans In the North believe In Mr. Payne's contention. The new rubber and shoe combination has a clause In its charter which requires detailed statements of the condition of Its affairs annually in other words, the in corporators believe that publicity is help ful. Doubtless there are holders of the Amalgamated Copper Company's stock who wish that it had not been managed as a blind pool. Th treaty for" the purchase of the Danish West Indies has been completed and will probably be ratified by the Senate imme diately after the holidays. It is a singu la fact that In 177 the United States agreed to pay $7.5XX00 for the Islands, while now we get them for $1,500,000. The people will never give us any trouble, and the Islands will probably advance greatly in value under American rule. The Kentucky Court of Appeals has af firmed a decision by a lower court dismiss ing indictments against the Western Union Telegraph Company for furnishing infor mation to a poolroom. The court held that telegraph companies are not censors of pri vate or public morals and cannot be re strained from or punished for delivering messages relating to lotteries or Rambling. This gives telegraph companies greater li cense than the United States mails, though the latter are under government control, while the former are not. A resolution passed by the Senate last winter called on the heads of departments for a statement showing the ages and com pensation of all employes In their respec tive departments. The report shows a con siderable number of elderly men In the employ of the government, Including one In the Government Printing Office who Is eighty-two years of age. one In the Agri cultural Department who is eighty-three, and so on. From one point of view these very old men are a hindrance to public business, but as they have served faithfully for many years without any provision be ing made for their retirement It would seem cruel to turn them out. Zn his remarks to thj conference of labor leaders and capitalists In New York Mr. Schwab, of tho United States Steel Cor poration, said that "those great trusts which are? formed in a business way to control the output of any commodity, to raise its price, have all failed." As Indi cating, the policy of the trust of which he Is the head. Mr. Schwab further declared that "a trust will succeed where there are motives of consolidation for economy's sake and for regulating trade generally." In other words, Mr. Schwab does not be lieve in such trusts as those which are undertaking to control the output and price f tobacco, whisky, twine, linseed oil, coal ell, sugar and other articles. Doubtless mot newspaper readers will not have any memories revived when their yes fall upon th" announcement of the death of Dr. R. S. lluldekoper, of Philadel phia, yet during October, UM, a great hub bub was raised when Ihj was chief eurgeon i nicnamauga uecause ma cnlei fame raj as a veterinarian. It was declared that because he had a "pull" a horse doc tor was chief surgeon. As a matter of fact, he was a skillful physician who had given attention to the treatment of horses. It was discovered during the investigation that he was a competent officer and was selected because of hU attainments. And now he dies from disease contracted while on duty at Chickarr.auga. MR. 

HEMENWAY'S COMMITTEE. Representative Hemcnway has rendered the country excellent service as chairman of the House committee to consider and correct the evils growing out of the laxity In the selection of employes for the House. The excellent service does not so much consist in the large amount of money which tho economic recommendations of Mr. Hemenway's committee will save the treasury as in correcting the current senti ment that any person who goes to Wash ington and Is insistent will be taken care of regardless of the needs of the work or the quality of the service he can render. The investigation of Mr. Hemenway's com mittee disclosed very remarkable condi tions. Men's names were on the pay roll who were in Washington only occasionally; others were drawing full pay for very lit tle service and employing other men to discharge their duties; men were discov ered to be assigned to alleged duties, and some men drewT pay" and did nothing else. Another fraud has been the custom of in creasing the pay of these well-paid men by special votes of the House at the close of the session. All these abuses have been laid bare, and while the House is probably paying more employes than are needed, many abuses, the growth of years, have been wiped out. As has been intimated, the smallest value of the service of Mr. Hemenway's commit tee is In the amount of money that the stopping of abuses will save. The action of the committee is notice that It is not tho purpose of the government to employ more men in Its service than are actually needed to do the work. This is true In the mail service and in other branches of the serv ice generally outside of the departments in Washington and the Congress. The gov ernment should not attempt to be an eleemosynary institution, and persistent place seekers should not be permitted to make It one by Insisting on employment where there is none. It is very difficult for members to refuse to assist those who seek places about Congress, whether they present claims or appear as unfortunates, but Justice to all and the Integrity of the public service demand that only the num ber of employes necessary to do the work shall be employed, and that they shall be selected upon the basis of merit, as em ployes are selected in well-managed busi ness houses. There can be no more cer tain way to encourage selfishness than to have the Impression gain currency that the government can make places for thoso who come to the years of man's estate without an employment. Furthermore, the making of a place for one man whose serv ices aro not necessary encourages two or three others who hear of his success -and become persistent applicants for like places. A score of such needless men on the pay rolls of the House will bring five score to seek them, so that the sending home of such as cannot be put on the pay rolls is a burden to congressmen. If Mr. Hem enway and his associates on the committee are sustained by the House a growing evil will be checked. 

BOSS CHOICER AT FRENCH LICK. Richard Croker's visit to French Lick seems to have had upon his mind somewhat the effect of a new sensation. Perhaps it is the first time he ever fully realized that a large part of the United States lies west of New York city and Tammany Hall. His travels have been mostly in the opposite direction. If the French Lick water has had as remarkable an effect on his physical condition as It seems to have had on his mental his visit may give him a new lease of life, for, from an intellectual point of view, Mr. Croker never took himself as seriously as he has done during his stay at French Lick. In New York, where his foot is on his native heath, as it were, and where he .hunts the tiger in its lair, he Is content with the role of Tammany boss and head of the greatest scheme of munici pal corruption ever org-anlzed. As grand almoner of official patronage and chief beneficiary of a general system of munici pal robbery and blackmail, he has been satisfied to hold his followers in line and pocket his profits without bothering about outside politics, except when an opportu-J nity offered of controlling a nomination or appointment in his own Interest. But at French Lick he opened out as a statesman. The water seems to have caused the feeble germ of intellect in his stupid and stolid nature to move sufficiently to heget a new emotion and to make him think he was actually capable of grasping ideas relat ing to public affairs. He talked about trusts and the attitude of parties toward them as if he actually knew something about them beyond levying tribute on them. When asked what he thought was the greatest evil of the Republican party he said: "The party's support of the trusts. There is little doubt In my mind that this country will be ruined if they aro not sup pressed. The common people, who make up the Democratic party, cannot live under the tyrannical rule of the trusts, and the masses of the Republican rarty are affected likewise. The Democratic party Is against trusts, and the decisive stand it has taken in this regard will be its salvation." The force of this statement lies In Its oracular ness. Some persons who discuss trusts, especially those who do so from an eco nomic or constitutional point of view, think It worth while to cite Instances and author ities, or to fortify their arguments with some evidence of knowledge on the sub ject. Mr. Croker disdains to do anything of the kind. Without offering any argument he simply states the conclusions which his original and creative .mind has reached un der the influence of French Lick water. "Delenda est Carthago," Carthage must be destroyed, said an ancient orator. "Trusts must be suppressed," says the Tammany boss, and in their suppression he sees the sure overthrow of the Republican party and the salvation of the Democratic party. So complete a mastery of a great and dif ficult problem, and so clear a perception of tho way to its solution could only have been achieved by a great philosophic in tellect trained in the school of Tammany and clarified by the influence of a health giving water. But because Mr. Croker has broken into tho field of national politics and begun to pose as a statesman It must not be sup posed that he Intends to abjure municipal politics. True, he did not attend the recent meeting of the National Civic Federation, and his name does not appear in the list of committeemen, but he will continue to take an interest In municipal affairs In his way. "As long as possible." he says, "I will give New York municipal politics my aid and assistance in an endeavor to make It stronger and more powerful than ever." Mark the words. He will give municipal politics his aid and assistance in an en deavor to make It "stronger and more powerful than ever." This implies that, in Mr. Croker's opinion, "it" has not been strong and powerful enough heretofore. If he had not been speaking at French Lick one might think that by "it" he meant Tammany, and that his purpose was to make "it" stronger and more powerful than ever 'before. But he was speaking of municipal politics, and it is incredible that in the highly clarified state of mind pro duced by the French Lick waters he could have confounded municipal politics with Tammany. Mr. Croker's attempt to pose as a statesman may furnish an Interesting study for sociologists and water-curists, but most persons will conclude that his forte is municipal politics. He had better hasten back to New York and engage in "it." INSIDIOUS ATTACKS UPON HOME PRODUCERS. An exchange frantically demands that "the duties be cut down so that there can be a wider exchange of goods and foreign markets opened for our products." Doubt less the person who wrote this confused demand has not ar.d will not stop to see what would bo the logical result of carry ing his demand Into effect. To reduce American duties on some of the articles embraced in the reciprocity treaties would be t6 open our markets to the goods of foreign competitors. Take the article of glass: the glass makers In the United States are making more than enough to supply the home market. The output is so large that the competition of the trust and the independent companies has caused a break in prices. With the present duties it Is not profitable to import window glass. Cut the duties in two, and the glass makers In France and Belgium would export con siderable quantities of glass to this coun try, but no glass would be shipped from the United States to those countries. They have no extended market for glass as has the United States. Consequently, all that the cutting of the duty on glass would do would be to give the foreign glass maker a better chance in our market. There are some people who call such a reduction of duties reciprocity. The foregoing Illustration In regard to glass applies to quite a number of articles in two or three of the reciprocal treaties now before the Senate. Many of the pro posed reductions of duties are on articles which we produce In abundance, and in the productloA of which there i3 a home competition sufficiently sharp to make a price at home regardless of the duty Im posed. We would not export a dollar's worth of goods under such treaties that we do not export now, while the cut in the duty on many articles proposed by the reciprocal treaties would open our mar kets to foreign competition. That is not the reciprocity which, in the words of the President, is the hanel-malden of pro tection, but the yielding of our markets to foreign competitors without any corre sponding advantage, indeed without any advantage whatever, but at the loss of a part of the home markets. If there are articles now paying duties which should be on the free list, let them be put there, but the indiscriminate cutting of duties without the certainty of corresponding re turn is not reciprocity but free trade. As for the assertion that the indiscriminate cutting of duties would open the markets of the world to us, it is not entitled to consideration. THE 

GERMAN-VENEZUELAX COX TROVERS Y. The situation between Germany and Ven ezuela is growing interesting and may re sult in some sort of a collision if the Venezuelan government is foolish enough to resist Germany's demands. These are for damages based on injuries alleged to have been done to German citizens in Ven ezuela, and are presumably Just and valid. A dispatch from Berlin says Emperor Wil liam has become weary of the delays In the settlement of the claims and has re solved to make a naval demonstration In Venezuelan waters and, if necessary, to land marines and take possession of a Venezuelan port. A Washington dispatch, which seems to speak advisedly, says this course will be pursued by Germany with the consent of the United States, previously obtained. "The State Department," says the dispatch, "has informed Baron Von Holleben that this government has no ob jections to offer to any proper disciplining of Venezuela by Germany or any other European power so long as territory is not taken. The German ambassador has assured the State Department and also President Roosevelt directly that 'Germany has no territorial aspirations, and after collecting the money long due from Ven ezuela to German citizens will withdraw from the country." There would seem, therefore, to be a clear understanding be tween the United States and Germany that the operations of the latter contemplate nothing more than enforcement cf the payment of her claims and perhaps an apology from Venezuela. This she has a right to Insist on, and a temporary seizure 'of a port to enforce the demand would not be a violation of the Monroe doctrine. An Interesting feature of the situation Is the defiant and almost bombastic announce ment of the Venezuelan official organ at Caracas that Venezuela is "conscious of her equality to other powers" and Intimat ing that if Germany resorts to forcible measures Venezuela may "exercise terrible reprisals." Instead of acting on this bad advice, she will probably conclude to settle. The New York Herald thinks "the of ficious nobodies who for three years have been fanning the flames of controversy around Admirals Sampson and Schley should now rest from their efforts to tar nish the glory of the American navy and injure its morale." It advises Congress to drop the naval controversy and address Itself to important business measures that are demanding attention. A movement is on foot among temperance advocates to have PrcMdent Roosevelt, through Secretary of Statu Hay, initiate a treaty with other leading nations prohibit ing the 6ale of liquors, opium and other Intoxicants or narcotics to aboriginal peo ples under their control. The motive of the movement is commendable, but as a matter of fact all aboriginal peoples have their own Intoxicants, some of which are worso than the civilized substitutes. Now and then some cne declares for a system of waterways that will connect the central West with the Atlantic or the gulf. The fact that the Erie canal, from Buffalo to New York city, cannot compete with the railroads ought to be sufficient reason to abandon all waterway schemes. In New York the Erie canal Is such a burden and Is so unsatisfactory that the suggestion has been made that the State abandon it and build a railroad on its bed, to be operated by power from Niagara Falls. The Chicago Tribune finds in the rapid Increase in the number of women In the "gainful occupations," as shown by the census since 1S70, one of the causes for the increasing number of divorces. The wom en who can support themselves will not submit to the neglect or abuse of hus bands, so they get divorces and become breadwinners. This is another case of placing the blame upon the woman. i The report comes from Washington that the supporters of the ship-subsidy bill and the irrigation bill will unite to carry both measures through the Congress. If both measures have real merit their friends should not cast doubt upon them by schem ing to carry them otherwise than on their merits. Democrats will see that their party In the House Is accepting the leadership of Mr. Bryan by opposing the Philippine policy, which, Mr. Bryan declares, must bo the leading Issue In 1904. THE

Washington Special to St. Louis Globe Democrat. Senator T. C. Piatt called at the White Houre to-day and asked President Roose velt If he Intended to countenance the visits of a slanderer. The President resented the Inquiry and the senator left in a rage. The war has broken out. All this grew out of a magazine article by William Allen White, of Kansas City, which, the senator alleges, seriously reflects on his political honor. It may be said on good authority that President Roosevelt instantly resented the inquiry made by Senator Piatt and inti mated that he was not responsible for the acts of everybody numbered among his casual acquaintances. He admitted that Mr. White had been brought to him by ex Controller Dawes; that he had visited the White House twice, but that no intimation was given to him on any occasion that any article about Senator Piatt or any other senator was in contemplation. The Presi dent would not argue the matter, but changed the subject abrutply. This is far more than mere rumor, though Senator Piatt refuses to discuss the interview. That he is much hurt does not admit of doubt. The Incident Is of supreme importance at this time because several prominent Re publican senators are rapidly drifting away from the President and no longer hesitate to express unfavorable opinions. The ac tivity and energy of the President, so pop ular thro'trhout the country, is not appre ciated by the statesmen who believe In old fashioned methods of selecting appointees for public office. The significance of Sen ator Piatt's visit to the President llos in the fact that he took so prominent a part in his nomination for the vice presidency that he no doubt believed their interests mutual in many respects. Before he called upon the President he probably felt that the safeguarding of his good name would be as much desired by the chief executive as by himself. In this respect the senator is reported to have been completely dis illusioned. Senator Piatt is in the mood to-night to prepare an essay on the frailty of political friendships. Senator Piatt has announced that he will sue William Allen White for libel and also McCIure's Magazine, in which the "charac ter study appeared. THE 

PAYNE APPOINTMENT. Wednesday's View. Indianapolis News, Dec. IS. His Postmaster General Smith's succes sor, Henry C. Payne, of Wisconsin, Is be lieved to be thoroughly qualified for the place. He has had abundant business ex perience, part of it in the line of the duties that he is soon to assume. He is not only a great politician and manager, but a suc cessful man. and is said to have marked executive ability. Thursday' Vlevr. Indianapolis News, Dec. 19. To place such a man at the head of the department in which, of all others,'" there is the greatest opportunity for abuse of the civil-service law, cannot but seem at first thought to be most remarkable. Mr. Roosevelt has always been regarded as first and foremost of all a civil-service re former. Is he not poing to make trouble for himself by inviting into his Cabinet a man that, so far as tho public knows, has never given evidence of possessing any feeling but contempt for clvil-Bervico re form?

CONGRESS IS AT REST WILL OT MEET AGAIN UNTIL FIRST MONDAY IX JANUARY. Nlcaragunn Canal nil! to Re Taken Up in the House on Jan. 7 mid Discussed Without Limit. BILL TOR THE PHILIPPINES MEASURE THAT PROVIDES FOR PE R 31 AN E NT CIVIL GOVERNMENT. Pension of ?3,000 Proposed for Mrs. McKinley Decision That Will Cost Uncle Sam $2,llS,Si:tJ. WASHINGTON, Dec. l:).-Before the House adjourned to-day over the holiday recess a special order was made for con sideration of the NIcaraguan canal bill. beginning on Tuesday, Jan. 7, and to con tinue until the bill Is disposed of, the order not, however, to interfere with revenue or appropriation tills. The session of the House was brief, the major portion of the time being occupied by Mr. De Armond, of Missouri, in making a personal explana tion regarding reports circulated in his dis trict concerning his course in the matter of the extension of the rural free delivery. Mr. Hepburn, of Iowa, chairman of the House committee on commerce, made Un report of the committee in favor of the Nicaraguan canal bill. After stating the terms of the bill the report says in part: The purpose of this bill Is to concentrate authority and responsibility for the con struction of this great work in the hands of the President. It has been believed that this course would be a safer one to be pur sued in carrying out the purposes of the bill. Involving the expenditure of so large a sum of money, all the work and all the expenditure to be made at a distance so far from the capital, than any other method that could be devised. We have tried to concentrate authority and responsibility rather than to disperse it among many- persons. The report refers to the "exhaustive re port made by the isthmian commission, of which Admiral Walker is the head, in which every feature of this enterprise is fully and at length discussed," and adds: "No doubt is expressed by the commission as to the practicability of the enterprise; on the contrary, they join with a score of predecessors in expressing their belief that the work can be carried to a successful termination within the limits of reason able cost and reasonable time. All of the great political parties are committed to the policy of the construction of this canal." The report then quotes the declarations of tho various party platforms and Presi dents McKinley and Roosevelt favoring the canal, in conclusion it says: "In view of the many thousands of pages written and spoken in advocacy of the immediate un dertaking and completion of this work, in view of the pledges mado by the parties that it should be undertaken and com pleted, in view of the recommendations made by the President of the United States, and in view of the almost universal demand of the American people that Con gress should at once do something effective in the inauguration and speedy completion of the Isthmian canal, your committee content themselves with this brief report, embodying their earnest recommendation that the bill pass." Mr. Cannon, of Illinois, asked unanimous consent for consideration of a bill for a deficiency appropriation of JlO.oou for fur nishing transcripts of records in the Gen eral Land Office. The employes who were doing this work, Mr. Cannon said, were mostly women, and he appealed to the House in the spirit of the yultide season to pass the bill. There was no objection and the bill was passed. The message of the President relative to the creation of an Apalachian forest re serve was laid before the House. No action was taken on the De Armond incident mentioned above. At 1:43 p. m. the House adjourned until Jan. 6, 1902. Rrlef Session of Sonnte. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. In the absence of Mr. Frye, of Maine, of the Senate, presi dent pro tern., Mr. Perkins, of California, presided over to-day's session of the Sen ate. The bill temporarily to provide reve nue for the Philippine Islands, which was passed by the House of Representatives yesterday, was referred to the committee on Philippines. A bill to increase the official bond of the United States marshal of Alaska, in certain cases, to J75,fXO was introduced by Mr. Ho?.r and passed without reference to com mittee. At 12:40. the Senate, on motion of Mr. Hale, when Into executive session, and at 1 p. m. adjourned until Jan. 6. 

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT. Proposed McKinley National Park Strongly Commended. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. President Roosevelt to-day sent to Congress a letter strongly commending the plan for a na tional forest reservation In the southern Apalachian region. The letter accompa nied the report of the secretary of agricul ture on this subject. The President stated that the facts ascertained set forth an economic need of prime importance to the South, and hence to the Nation as a whole, and they point to the necessity of protect ing through wise legislation a mountain region whose influence flows far beyond its borders with the waters of the rivers to which it gives rise. After referring to the marvelous variety and richness of growth in this region, the President says it is unsurpassed for purposes of a hard wood reserve, and he earnestly commends the project to Congress. 

PHOPOSED LEGISLATION. Civil Government Measure for the Philippine Islands. WASHINGTON, Dec. 1D.-Secretary Root and Representative Cooper, of Wisconsin, chairman of the House committee on in sular affairs, were In conference to-day, and as a result of this and further con ferences to be held daring the holidays an Important legislative measure is to be drafted for a complete civil government for the Philippines. Already the measure is framed In the rough, and the perfected bill will be ready for introduction In the Houe soon after the recess, by which time Judge Taft will have arrived from the Philippines to give such advice as Congress may de sire on the various features involved. The bill in the rough draft covers the questions of mining and forestry with a view to de veloping the industries, at the same time regulating the acquisition cf mining and timber lands, the disposition of the lands of the friars, the regulation of franchises, the establishment of banking facilities, the enactment of coinage and currency pro visions requisite for the peculiar conditions there existing. It is stated that the general purpose of the measure Is to bring about self-government among the natives at the earliest practicable date, and this Is to be accom plished largely by giving stability and sys tem to the civilizing agencies of commerce, banking, exchange, education, telegraph. etc. Those taking part in the framing of the measure hnd that it is a task of un usual proportions, far greater than that of framing the Porto Rico civil government bill, owing to the conditions In the Philip pines, the continued presence of the mili tary branch and the transitional stage of ihenatlves towards self-government. To Control Trusts. WASHINGTON. Dec. 13. Representative Jenkins, of Wisconsin, who proposed a con stitutional amendment to control trusts In the last Congress, to-day Introduced a measure In Congress of a similar nature, providing for a constitutional amendment giving Congress power to regulate com merce in tho l'nited States. The bill pro vides that "all private corporations, co partnerships and joint stock companies in the United States shall be under the con trol of Congress. Congress shall have power in the United States to regulate, control, prohibit and dissolve all contracts and combinations in restraint of trade or commerce. In the absence of legislation by Congress pursuant to this article all pow ers conferred upon Congress by this article may be exercised by the several States." To Pension Mrs. McKinley. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. Senator Hanna to-day introduced a bill granting a pension of $T,i0 a year to Mrs. McKinley, widow of the late President. To Fl Waes of Women. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. A bill was In troduced in the Senate to-day by Mr. Mitchell, fixing J2 as the minimum rate of wages to be paid to women in the employ of the government. DOl 

RLE-ACTION DECISION. Porto Hicnns Will Get 92,11S,S20 and Importers the Same Amount. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. Mr. Trace well. controller of the treasury, has rendered a decision on tho question submitted by the secretary of the treasury as to whether the balance of $337,302 remaining undis posed of the total sum of J2.118.S26 col lected as import duties on merchandise coming from Porto Rico Into this country prior to the date of the taking over of the island until the Foraker act went into ef fect, is subject to further allotment to Porto Rico." The controller holds that It is. The act of March 24. 1300. provided that the revenues on these imports should be returned to Porto Rico, of which all but JCl'T. has ben so returned. The de cision of the Supreme Court rendered some time ago declared that these duties were illegally collected, and since that time they have been returned to the Importers as raipidly as their claims were proven. The effect of the controller's decision is that the whole amount collected, aggregating J2.11S.S20, will be returned to the Porto Ricans and a like amount refunded to the importers, so that the government itself will lose J2,'üf.S2t by the transaction. Guns of the Illinois Tested. WASHINGTON. Dec. 13. The Navy De partment has received from Capt. George A.

D0W1E SOBS IN COURT "ELIJAH II" TESTiriES WHILE TEARS STREAM DOWN HIS FACE He Tells the Jury Hon His Confidence in Ilrother-ln-Lnvr Steven son Was Shaken. DENIES LATTER'S CHARGES SAYS HE DID NOT CSE HONEYED WORDS TO GET MONEY. Testimony of Secretary Jndd Who Thinks His Employer Is the Prophet of Olden Times. CHICAGO, Dec. 13. "Dr." John Alexan der Dowle, the proclaimed "Elijah the Re storer," broke down when he went on the witness stand to-day in his own behalf, and between choking sobs told how his con fidence in his brother-in-law and legal op ponent, Samuel Stevenson, had been shaken. The portly figure of the aged wit ness shook 'spasmodically, and the tear streamed down his fac as he reJaied mem ories of Stevenson's espousal of Dowlo's sister, now deceased. Later, as h was cross-examined, his meek and lowly de meanor changed, and he denounced Steven son, called him an "abominable traveling companion," and said that he was of no use in "Zlon" and was always blundering. Judge Tuley's court was packed to over flowing with followers of "Elijah II," who followed minutely the "doctor's" testimony, and who at tho end of the day's session gathered around him to act as his body guard back to "Zlon." The testimony of fered by Dowle was to the effect that he had given Stevenson the checks aggregat ing JOO.OX), ostensibly to relieve certain in debtedness between them. The check3 were exhibited in court and showed indorse ments by Mary Ann Stevenson for stock in Zion lace industries. Dowie went Into great detail to show how his stock had accident ally come back Into his possession, explain ing that he had been "Immensely sur prised" to find the certificates for the stock in his private safe. Stevenson' had set up the claim that he had never received the certificates. Dowie set down as "nonsense" the charge that by "honeyed words'' or "artifice" he had Inveigled Stevenson to come to America to take charge of the lace Industrie, and denied that he had usd any power whatever to that end. The all-night sessions which, according to testimony, were frequent with Dowie and his disciples, were explained as necessary because he was a "very busy man." He alsoVxplaincd some of the methods of Zion's financial op erations, in an effort to prove that Steven son's claim to a joint partnership with him in the lace industries was at no time ever contemplated. C. J. liarnard, general manager of Dowie's Zion liank. told of Stevenson" objection to the manner in which the lace Industires were being managed, and how he had asked for J1.V.0"0 to give up his Interest In them. Certificates of block in the institution were produced as evidence that Stevenson at first had not considered himself a partner with Dowie, but Ju'ce Tuley drew from the witnem the fact t.. the original stock company had been aban doned and a private agreement drawn up whereby Dowie controlled everything. It was also developed that Dowie had Ar ranged with the manager of the bank to give Stevenson 0 any time he aked fur it. Dowie'H attorney, however, hastened to show that the "doctor's" reason for so doing was that affairs with Stevenson had not been complt-tely arranged. During the cross-examination of Ranker Barnard Attorney Iteeves drew from him the testimony that the certificate for JXtwJ worth of lace stock made out to Mary Ann Stevenson, and which had disappeared, came to light after Mrs. Stevenson's death, in DoVie's own safe. Mr. Barnard related that Dowie had said wonders would never cease, and that he was utterly at a loss to find the document among his private papers. A sharp tilt between Judge Tuley and Attorney Packard, for the defense, ensued when H. Worthlngton Judd, secretary of the Zlon lace Industries and Zlon Land and Investment Association, was called to the stand. Attorney Iteeves had asked Judd whether he believed Implicitly that Dowie was Klljah. Packard objected to the ques tion, but the judge ruled it pertinent to tho case and Judd affirmed his belief that the preacher was the prophet of olden times. AMALGAMATED COPPER.
