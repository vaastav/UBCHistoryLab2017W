Years since, Claflin, the author of Woodhull's being, -kept a hotel in Shalersvillc, Portage County.

WINDHAM. 1 Correspondence, - It has been some time since Wind ham has spoken through the columns of the Press, I venture again to relate a few items. Literary. The Literary Society hold their regular meetings on every Wednesday, at the Town Hall. De bates are the more general exercises. The discussion for Wednesday evening November 29th 'was i ' Jlesoloed, That it is wrang to send milk to the cheese factory on the Sabbath," and wrong to manufacture milk into cheese on the Sabbath. ' The question was ably dis cussed, the judges deciding in favor of the affirmative. The next question is Hesolved, That : the right of suffrage should be given to the women. The Young Ladies Mission Band gave an entertainment at the Town Hall on Monday eve., Nov. 27th. The exercises consisted of tableaux, mu sic etc. It was an amusing exercise- The Select School under the direc tion of B. B. Loughead as teacher, is in a flourishing condition. " Religious. The Sunday Schools re anticipating good times Christmas. At the Preacher's Association of Ravenna Dist., M. E. Church, held in this place 'on the - 14th and 15fh, and the Ravenna Dist. Sunday School In stitute, held on the 16th. some twelve ministers were present, also, some twenty teachers and superintendents. ne exercises were very interesting and instructive. . The weather was bad, consequently the attendance was not as large as desired Bexe-olext. Considerable amount of clothing, provision, &et, have been contributed to the sufferers by fire in the West, from this town ; amount es timated at $700. Improvements. The A. & G. W. R. It. Co., commenced work Monday the 27th upon the grounds of the Co, where the old depot was burned some three weeks since, with a force ofjr, hands, for the purpose of putting up a first class freight.and passenger de pot, for which the citizens express their congratulations to the Co. The building is to be 16 x 60 feet. F. Wisdham, Nov. 30, 1871. ' GARRETTSVILLE Correspondence Again the resistless march of time has left another year to mingle with misty items of the past, since the peo-. plo ot the State of Ohio observed a day of thanksgiving and praise to the Divine Creator, for the blessings and abundance of the year which prcceeds. Although our land, as prosperous as its rulers will allow, has in some parts been visited by the lire fiend, with terrible effect, yet it has been visited with a fair degree of prosperity. On the morning of Thanksgiving day our citizens gathered together at the Congregational Church, and lis tened to a very able and well prepared discourse which was delivered by Elder Bowen, who has been the pastor of the Baptist Church in our village during the last year. In the evening the Phil ologian Literary Society pre sented one of their popular plays, called the " Dream at Sea," to a large audience in the Buckeye Hall. This entertainment was held for the benefit of the "Western sufferers. The re ceipts amounted to about fifty dollars. On the evening before Thanksgiving a turkey raffle was held in this village which resulted in the disposal of quite a number of the feathered tribj. Dur ing the progress of the raffle we are informed that some-enterprising indi vidual was desirous of obtaining a little interest on the money invested, without authority from head-quarters appropriated two gobblers which were in very good order for the occasion. A few days since G. H. Adams dis posed of hisV.ore building and village lot on Silver street to J. H. Bugrand and S. S." Beecher, who contemplate to soon remove the frame building now occupying the premises and erect ing in its place a first-class brick building. This seems to be another step in the right direction to add to the general appearance of the street and to decrease the existing danger of fire. Southern. GarrcttsvUle, Dec. 2d, 1871. On the 27th ult., a horse valued at $70 was stolen from the stable of a Mr. Thomas, at Yellow Springs, and the citizens were seriously contem plating the matter of Ku-Kluxing the thief. Nothing had been heard from Grant at the latest reports. Terrific Hurricane. Boston, Dec. 1. A special dispatch to the Traveller from Halifax says: A hurricane visited the northern side of the Island of Cape Breton on the night ot the 27th ult., doing immense damage to houses, barns, trees and shipping. The gale began at 8 o'clock and lasted until five next morning. The tide was four feet higher than ev er known before. The w.harf at Port Hood was swept away, and in the vil lages several houses were blown down A number of vessels aucbored at Port Malgrave dragged their anchors and passed out of the strait to the sea. The Berraudian brig .Tabor, from Charlottetown, was wrecked on Fox Islaud and only one man saved. Ten schooiicrs were wrecked in the strait of Canso. It is feared theirs has been considerable lost of life by the gat. A case is on trial at Columbia, South Carolina, involving the constitutional ity of the Ku-Klux act of last Con gress. Hon. Reverdv Johnson, of Maryland, and Hon. Henry Stanberry, of this State, are employed as counsel against the validity of the bill. According to a Salt Lake dispatch the snow at Little Cottonwood on the 27th nit, was about six feet deep on the level, and the residents of Alta City had to dig themselves in and out of their dwellings. That must be a delightful country we think not. A negro who murdered Mr. E. E. King in Haywood county, Tennessee, was arrested near Brownsville, while reading to his family. That's another Ku-Klux outrage for the Radicals to howl over. A poor, intelligent and reliable colored citizen rutblessty torn from the bosom of his family merely for killing a white man! According to the authority of the Radical journals there is great tribnla tion in the Democratic party over the Presidential question. But the jour nals that wear the Grant collar have very little to say about the way the Radical mind is torn up these days over the opposition of Grecley.Schurz, Dana, Gratz Brown and numerous prominent bead-lights and leading journals of the Radical household, to the re-nomination of their master the rooss receiver. on. 1- W. Voorhees on the Democratic Situation. Terre Hacte, Ind., Nov. 27. Hon. Daniel W. Voorhees is out in a card in the Journal, of tbis city, in which he proposes an important Democratic party movement. tie says: 1 Keenly appreciate the importance of an authoritative express ion of the principles which are to guide ns in the future as in the past. It should be made, too, at an early date, in order that the organization shall be perfected, and confidence restored bv the time the approaching campaign is npon us. This, however, should be the work of a National Convention, embracing delegates from all the States. I am iu favor of calling such a Con vention at some central point in the west, and on a dav not later than the 22d of February. The call should be issued by the .National Executive Com mittee. Delegates should be to care fully and patieDtly weigh all the views before it, and to agree upon and pub lish a definite declaration of princi ples upon all matters effecting the po litical welfare of the people and the safety of our free institutions. This beinsrdone, it should adjourn to a day fixed for the nomination of a candidate for the Presidency, and in the mean time discuss and approve or disap prove of what has been done. It wou ld then be the duty of all Democrats tak iug part in politic, to submit to the majority. If there are such as prefer their own convictions, even to the plat form of a National Convention, they can step aside in quiet, without em barrassing anybody else. Let us, however, have political, as well as personal harmony, and success is within our reach. If the entire Dem ocratic vote can be consolidated, in spired with enthusiasm and brought to the polls, General Grant cannot be re-elected. It was the vote in our par ty that stayed at home on the days of the late elections which wrought such wide spread defeat. There is no in crease of the Republican vote. I make the above suggestion, know ing that it is entirely practicable, and that it meets a just . demand of the present crisis. I .shall respectfully urge it upon the attention of the Na tional Executive Committee and ask for the favorable consideration of Con servative men everywhere. . . The, New York correspondent of the Springfield (Massachusetts) lie- publican savs that Congress, at the coming session, will make no general revision in tlfe tariff. Of course it will not. The monopolist manufac turers and the corrupt rings will have full sway as long as the Grant Ad ministration lasts. The Richmond State Journal, the Republican organ in that State,. wants a reconsoiiaation with the dismem bered counties composing the State of West "Virginia. It says, with plain earnestness, " we believe, as we did at the time, that the division of "Virginia into two States was wholly uncalled for and unwarrantable. The reasons given for it were puerile and inade quate. No good whatever has or can grow out of it, but it will be a matter of contention for . a generation be tween two weak fragments of what was once and may again become a noble State. We are unalterably for the reconstruction of the old common wealth of Virginia, in its original ter ritorial integrity." Very likely this is to be the platform of the reconstructed Radical party of the State. A Slight Discrepancy, On the 21st of July, 1868, says the Washington Patriot, Mr. Bout well stated, iu the House ot Representatives that the debt had been reduced, be tween April, 1855, and January, 1868, one thousand and sixty-six millions of dollars. According to the public debt statement, it has been further reduced since March 1, 1871, 273,749,811 98, making a total reduction, according to the Secretary oflie Treasury, of over $1,349.000,000 fn the last six years. On the 30th of June, 1865. the total debt $2,680,646,869 64; deduct from this the reduction stated by the Secretary of the Treasury, namely, $1,340,748,971 98 and the total debt should now be Sl, 330,898,047 76. But according to the public debt statement of the first inst., it is S2, 361,051,842 21, a discrepancy of o,ver a thousand millions of dollars precise ly $1,030,143,785 05! These arc the figures of the Treasu ry Department, and the statements of its chief; it is not for ns to recoucile or explain them. They are matter of record, and, we call upon the support ers of the Administration to attempt their denial or refutation. We can show book and page where they can be found of record, placed there by the Secretary of the Treasury and we challenge contradiction. George Wilkes a vigorous sup porter of the Republican "party here tofore, is alarmed at the political drift iu the direction of monarchy. He considers that the public liberties in the United States and its very form of Government is threatened by the grow ing tendency to conspiracies of wealth in the form of land, railway and steam ship monopolies and monied corpora tions. There ought to be an awaken ing among our people iu regard to this matter before it is too late.
