'Press Taxed to Capacity Since Oc tober; Little Movement Shown Cotton In Field Go Un pick is Belief Cotton is again being receive! at the local compress, an embargo which lias been almost perpetual i during tlie past two -months bavin;; been lifted. The compress 1ms been taxed to capacity since the middle of October and only a small amount of cotton has been received. This condition, according to L. Peery, manager of the compress, is a result of the cot ton market conditions in view of which little cotton has 'been shipped out of this city. That only three-fourths of tho county's cotton crop has been har vested and ginned is the belief of A. F. Houston, county agricultural agent. Since the recent rains and cold weather will hamper tho pick ing of cotton, Mr. Houston believes that a bulk of the floeey product now in the field never a!" be bar vested but will bo used as pastures. ISTON PLANS MONSTRATIQNS TO SAIE FARM Much Terracing. Should be Done County, He Says; Annual Loss From Erodon Runs Into Millions in 'Several community terracing dem onstrations in Grady county are be ing planned by A. F. Houston, the mnty agricultural agent. In announcing these plans, Mr. Houston pointed to data showing that many Grady county farms are depreciating in value as a result of erosion. This loss, which runu well into millions, can bo prevented by terracing, the county agent declares. Dates and places of the communi ty terracing demonstrations planned by Mr Houston have not been defin itely determined. Speaking of the necessity of terracing in Grady conn ty, the county agent said: "A few well-constructed terraces on each hill-side will prevent the soil washing and conserve the v.intei rain for summer crops. It is essen tial that the terraces be construct ed while tho soil is prodrctive and free from deep canyons. "The older states have dona ex tensive terracing in recsi't years, but not until the soil was impover ished, making it neoefa.-;' to add tin soil after the m. -i t -t 1 . ti of the terraces. "Two men with four head of, mu'.es or horses can average terracin,; ten icres daily; no additional machinery is necessary for this. "A few demonstrations of correct terracing this winter and spring will pen the way for some real efi'ee ive work in this line next fall and winter." Mr. Houston requests that rural teachers and community leaders se lect a satisfactory place and make rrangements for a terracing dem onstration in their respective com munities.

The original charges were filed before tho dedth of Hamon. Both Mr. Brown and Sheriff Buck Garrett said Sheri.f Orndorff had been asked for additional informa lion. Tho message received 'by Slier iff Garrett from, tlie El Paso p.liU'llf was as follows: "Have reliable . information that Clara Smith is in a Mexican town nrar tho border, it. will cost.

Mr. Brown refused to comment on steps that possibly .would be take.i in the event Miss Smith has been located, inasmuch as the present regime in Mexico has not been for mally recognized .by the United States. 1L? said he had telephoned to the district attorney of Bexar county re quiting that official to take 'jiUie charge of the investigation of a statement alleged to have beencimd" by P.

Th" county attorney did not say how he regarded the El Paso a l-1 vices, but. seemed to place some 'ailh in them. Russell B. Brown, county attorney of Carter county, said that Sheriff Buck Garrett had shown to him. a telegram ostensibly from.
