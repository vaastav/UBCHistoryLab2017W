REFORM MEASURE IS SAID TO BE CHOSEN Interstate Commerce Commission Bill Declared to Be Favored by Both Houses. By W W Jermane. Washington Dec. 6.'Over night there seems to have been a more or less complete surrender of the forces in the senate which have ee opposing the president's railroad policvif not a surrender, such a modification of posi tion as to suggest ultimately the presi dent's complete triumph. At no time since the iate agitation was begun hag the situation been so promising to those -vho stand with the president. Thus far the chief outward sign of thi-, surrender is found in the interview given out by Senator Elkms, in which he appears to come over to the presi dent's position. Bu under the sur face there are signs of equal signifi cance that all point in the one general directionthe enactment of legislation such as the,public is demanding and the president is urging. These signs may all be misleading. Tho fight may yet come on in the senate with all the tremendous force which it has been accumulating for a vear past, and the enactment of.desired legislation may be secured, if at all, with exceeding difficulty. Battle Nearly Won. But the fact still remains that with in the past twenty-four hours the presi dent has made a decided advance in position, and now feels, as do all his friends, that the battle is a good deal more than half won, and that ultimate victory, possibly without serious oppo sition, is certain. I is entirely possible that the senate committee, or a large majority of it, including Elkins, chairman, may report the interstate commerce commission's bill. This bill embodies the president's plan, and in many respects is the best bill that has been presented. What Olapp Says. The general drift toward the presi dent is today so noticeable as to cause widespread comment. Said Senator Clapp of Minnesota today: 'The legislation recommended by the president is certain to be enacted and Without serious difficulty or loss of time. I do not want to prophesy as to a date, but I will say that the bill will go to the president for his approval at a comparatively early period in the session. I regard the fight as being already won, and am very sure that our strength will increase as the days go by." The house committee on interstate and foreign commerce will probably Support the interstate commerce com mission bill, discarding all the others as not being equal to it in simplicity and directness. President's Preferences. The president, while he has not said that any particular bill is the admin istration bill, is entirely willing that this be done, for he regards the inter state commerce commission bill as pre senting a satisfactory statement of his position. If this bill is reported from the house committee, it will pass that body and go to the senate. The house having thus selected that bill as the one best calculated to accomplish the desired results, it will be taken up by the senate committee and reported to the senate by a majority vote. I is said today 'that it is doubtful if more than about three senators on that committee oppose itAldrich, Kean and Forakerand they will^ be in such a small minority as to give their position relatively small weight. Three Against Many. With a gjeat majority of the senate in favor ot the legislation, as is now said to be the case, it will be quite out of the question for these three sen ators, even when joined by their fol lowers on the floor, to filibuster to the extent of preventing a vote. So the whole house, the president's friends the house and his friends in the sen ate, now believe that the battle is going their way, and that the desired legis lation is as good as secured. I may be that the senate commit tee, if it should turn out that the presi dent has won his fight, will anticipate action in the house and itself report the interstate commerce commission bill, placing it on the senate calendar in advance of action in the house. This might be good strategy. 1 President Stands Pat There has been no change in the pres ident's position. He is standing pat'' and is not considering any compromise. He is standing for a definite principle and comprise is not possible, for to compromise would be to surrender. All the talk of compromise continues to come from the other side, and when analyzed, it, too, takes the form of sur render. Senator Clapp said today: %-'^^m&

The deance. cision of any tribunal is, in common law, prima facie evidence of the cor rectness of that decision. I so hap pens that most of ttie actions brought before our courts involve pecuniary considerations, and so the practice has grown up of oermitting appeals, the interests of the litigants meanwhile be ing protected by bonds. Bonds cou^d not be given on an appeal from a rate decision because of the complication the operation involves, -uul besides, bonds are only given to insure the pay ment of the disputed claims, if in the end the courts say payment is neces sary. Nobody ever had disputed the ability of the railroads to pay these claims, hence the bond proposition does not apply with full force. We are thus brought back to the common law prop osition that the decision of any tri bunal is prima facie evidence of the soundness of that decisicn. We want the interstate commerce commission to have the power to name a rate and put it into effect at once, and that it what will set."

Journal Special Service. Washington, Dec. 6.The interests hostile to President Koosevelt's solu tion of the railroad rate question have capitulated. There will be legisla tion of a sound, comprehensive charac ter, embodying the principles which the president sharply defined in his mes sage: Leaders of the two houses have de cided there should be rate legislation during this session. Further confer ences ratified this decision with a unanimity which showed public ^opinion1 at last had produced the effect the presi dent sought when he first opened the rate campaign. Senator Elkins told the senate com mittee on interstate commerce yester day that the president's views had ap pealed to him from the start that he had been given as authority for state ments which he never made an'd he is confident a bill would be agreed upon within the time the country would con sider reasonable. I this way Elkins mounted the band wagon. Aldrich's Righteous Air. Aldrich of Ehode Island assumed a righteous air when he said congress must give expression to public opinion. Senator Gorman found time to ex press hearty indorsement of the presi dent's railioad rate message, adding that it is useless to combat universal public sentiment. Even Senator Foraker found some thing in the president's message to appiove, butwhether he places himself beside Elkins or not, there is not the slightest doubt now that rate legislation will be passed, which will be satisfac tory to the president and the people. His Enemies Astonished. Theodore Eoosevelt 's first message de livered in his own right as president of the United States EaB astonished his enemies, if he has any, and delighted his friends.

Mr. Spooner ex pressed surprise that an outside body should be directed to frame a bill for the senate, saying that such a course was unprecedented. Mr. Newlands said his only desire was that the senate should avail itself of the knowledge and skill of the commission but he wanted to secure such a bill and ex pressed indifference as to its author ship.

There was a good gathering of members of parlia ment and delegates from all parts of the country. Neither Williarii O'Brien nor Timo thy M.

This is the bargain secured last night by somebody who purchased a sack of popcorn at Clint Webster's confectionery store, 34 Central avenue. Mr. Webster had an unusually busy evening, and just before the Tush began he took his diamond ring from his lin ger, and placing it in a sack, laid it away on a shelf. paid no more at tention to the jewel until closing time, when he decided to put it on again and go home. Search where he would, he could find no trace of the ring, and as the sack was gone trom the shelf he knew it would be useless to look further. No one but he had been near the shelf and he was convinced that in 6 moment of forgetfulness ho had filled the sack with popcorn and handed it to some purchaser. Unless the lucky customer swallowed the diamond unknowingly, he probably thinks he was the winner in some prize package contest. Mr. Webster hag taken a day off, calling on his ac quaintances who purchased popcorn of him last night. Another Sparkler Gone. Another Minneapolitan to lose a dia mond yesterday by an odd mischance was C. L. Cory, who rooms at 23 Wash ington avenue S.

Mr. Cory was but partly clad, and could not follow the thief. The boy entered the room ostensibly to sell a' paper. Mr. Cory refused to buy and the newsboy, seeing the dia mond on the dresser, snatched it and ran downstairs. The owner followed the boy to the hallway, but was com-' pelled to stop there.

Accused of Poisoning Pump to Kill Mrs. Gertrude, Lund strom, a Schoolteacher. Special to The Journal. Owatonna, Minn., Dec. 6.Miss Wilda Johnson was today indicted by the grand jury on the charge of at temptingto poison Mrs. Gertrude Lund strom. The history of this case is un usually interesting. Jealousy is sup posed to have been the taotive for the alleged crime. Both young women were reared and have lived nearly all their lives in the township of Havana in this county. Mrs. Lundstrom is an attractive young widow, who since the death of her hus band a few years ago in Wisconsin, has been teaching the country school near the home of her parents, Mr. and Mrs. L. Johnson. Wilda Johnson is a young woman of frail physique. Her face is pallid and she shows every evi dence of the strain under which she is laboring. Before the alleged attempted poison ing, Wilda Johnson was receiving the attentions of a prominent young man living near her home. That she liked the man there was no doubt and it was not until he was seen in the company of Mrs. Lundstrom that trouble crossed her path. On one occasion he was known to have taken Mrs. Lundstrom to the theater in Owatonna. Later he was frequently at the home of Mrs.the Lundstrom and the Sunday before the alleged attempted crime, the young man accompanied Mrs. Lundstrom and her parents homes from the country church. Paris Green in Well. The following Tuesday night was marked by a severe rainstorm and the next morning at 5:30 o'clock, when Mrs. Lundstrom was preparing the morning meal, she went to the pump to draw a pail of water. While en gaged in this act, her attention was called to the pronounced and unusual greenish color of the water and realiz ing that something was wrong she went to the barn at once to summon her father. When they returned there was a heavy sediment oif greeno itna the bot- tomCof -theC JaTland to decide that the color was induced by S Name Not Mentioned in Brown's Talk with President on Chinese Boycott. By W. W. Jermane. Washington, Dec. 6.An authorita tive statement is made at the state de 1artmen that H. Brown, of Port and, Ore., who saw the president yes terday and discussed the Chinese boy has not made any charges against Jbhn Goodnqw, former consul general at Shanghai, as being a promoter of or In other ways connected with, the boycott to the disadvantage of American in terests. A further statement is made that if Brown had made such charges they would not have been considered, as Mr. Goodnow is not now connected with the government in any way. I this connection, it was said today, that at the time the boycott was in full swing, unofficial charges were made to the state department that Mr. Good now was one of those who conceived it and that he was energetic ij^pushmg it among the Chinese. I cannot be saia that the department took cognizance of these charges, but the story is that Mr. Goodnow replied to them, denying that he had anything to do with them, and presenting documentary evidence of his connection with certain American busi ness houses, doing business in China, and showing that if the boycott were enforced it would mean the total loss of business to himself. This statement could not be verified, and, in fact, officers of the department, who were asked about it, declared they had not heard it. Department officials, with whom Mr. Brown has talked, say that he is urging reforms in the consular service in China, particularly with reference to consular courts and the imposition of certain fees.

London, Dec. 6.The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Daily Telegraph wires under date of Sunday by way of Eydtkuhnen, Prussia: "The decisive struggle between the forces. of anarchy an a the elements of order is drawing near. On the one hanyd:rt,ear revolutionists,S lacking' funds, hU affluent men by threat "On the other hand, the soldiers, im Cossacks and rabble are anxious to punish the enemies of God. and th czar, and with difficulty are restrained for a moment. Bankruptcy looming on the horizon may precipitate events which no minister, no cabinet, can any longer control. SHJ The Fateful Question. "The fateful question with which Eussia is now confronted is whether the nation will await the election of the legislative assembly or help anar chy to victory. The cabinet was formed for the purpose of putting the power in the hands of the national assembly, and if it cannot accomplish this, will resign. "The aim of the revolutionists is to compel the cabinet to create a series of accomplished facts modifying the manifesto of Oct. 80, which the douma shall then"be unable to alter. Thus they demand a set of temporary measures snch as equal rights for all citizens, which if granted would by their very nature be not temporary, tut definitive and immutable. If the Jewish disabil ities are thus removed by a new minis terial act, anti-Jewish riots accompanied by awful massacres would inevitably follow, because the people would resent any usurpation by ministers of the power belonging only to nation and czar. Hen'ce the government is extreme ly desirous of bringing the douma to gether and great haste is how being made to frame an electoral law. Appeal for Strike. "Cleverly worded leaflets are being distributed broadcast among the troops urging them not to rise against the czar but to strike for better material con ditions, more abundant food, higher pay and less work. "Personally, I am disposed to believe* the present deadlock will terminate in violence, but without very serious loss" of life. "Hungry strikers may attempt to 5 loot shops, which will be protected by* -m Cossacks and guardsmen who, feeling no love for the black-coated agitators,*, may repeat the terrible scenes of three years ago. If revolvers be fired or* bombs thrown against the troops .the^ bitterness will become intense. "It is improbable that the teleg raphers' strike will last longer thanr Tuesday without provoking bloodshed. Dictatorship as Check. In another message of the same date the same correspondent says: "The masses and classes of Russia are being driven and drawn into an archy, which can be checked only by a military dictatorship. Nihilism, pure and simple, not any practical political program, is the goal aimed at by an insignificant minority, to whom the rule not merely of the autocracy, aris-'-J tocracy and the middle classes, out of the entire nation, seems the one thing* necessary. I am informed that the German so cialists sought to dissuade their Rus sian colleagues from a purely nihilistiei^ line of action, but the latter, who are^ more in need of cash than advice, scorn fully refused to be advised. The in-w* telhgent classes, nerveless, gritless, arel?* continuously hypnotized by the revo-r^l lutionists, who are resolved to pull down the whole social and political fabric, altho not knowing what to put in its place." Witte Ministry Doomed. The correspondent of the Times at St. Petersburg, under date of Dec. 4* says: I well-informed circles it is believed the strike will prove fatal to the ministry of Count Witte. I hear that M. Guchkoff or Professor Migoulin. the latter an avowed opponent of the premieris likely to take over the gov ernment, with a program including the distribution of the state domain among the peasants and old-age pensions for workmen.
