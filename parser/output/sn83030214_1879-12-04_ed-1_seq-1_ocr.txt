Mnitv of tl.e more discreet ninoogthc Democratic leaders wotthl Im? pi id to avoid it if possible. Bot? bo far a* I have heard, Itocnuse of its injarious effect ?>n the industrial interests of the country, now seek ii?: t ? make up some of t he losses anil repair some of tin i.:>..?? rs of nearly six yearn of ?h pit ssion, but, to quote an expression used by one of i hem, because thev have been ruined politically by tho attitude their party has heretofore tiikcn m r. gard to the currency anil resumption. The disposition to lcgis late lorli.it in mey. to drive the gold currvney of the world out of circiilatfhu in th<' United States by providing tor an unlimited expansion of silver coin? age cc nineties, to make resumption a failure after it has achieved a success never equalled in the financial history of tho world and when tho whole country is enjoy inn the benefits of the prosperity it has brought, is ns strong in the Detiioctatic party to-day as it ever was; and if none of the crazy theories that have been devised to ii jiiie the crclil of the country, debase the cur? rency und clog the wheels of business, are enacted into laws this AN inter it will be first because the ft'publican minority in l?uh houses of Congress will almost unaniinoti'dy resist their passage and a Republican ftrcsuli nt will interpose his veto against them, or because the Democratic party leaders do not consider it safe in view of the ap? proaching I'residential struggle to pat their finan? cial theories into statutes. 1 have said that some financial discussion in Con? gress is inevitable during the preseut Winter. I do not believe that the wise recommendations of the President and Secretary of the Treasury in tho annual message and the report, in re card to tho future treatment of greenbacks, will receive any serious attention lrom Concress. Jr is doubtful if even the ft.-publicans in the Seuate and House of Representatives, especially those from the West, could be induced to carry out t hose recommenda? tions even if they were in a majority : and it is cer? tain that no large number of tho Democrats will sustain them. The discussion is much more likely to take place upon bills to remove tho restrictions lrom the coinage of silver and to retire the notes of the National banks In order j to make room for the issue of more legal tenders. Hut even measures of this kind have little chance of Wcotning laws, and the business ?MB of tin country ought to be making up their minds nt once net tube disturbed when mich bills are introduced or even WBBfl they are reported from (iiiiinittees, NothiiiK will come of them; and the BBBflt will do well not to allow themselves tobe alarmed B" anything which max be attempted. 1 do not mean to say that then should In- fottered among I'epnbliein members of (ton grass a fselingod GalsS security leading to a letting down of elLut against da tue. oils measures that

Tbe taunts of the Constantinople press have reached Downing Street, Said a Turkish paper not iiitnv day-j ago: "You pretend to rorortu Asia Minor; you had better begin with Ireland,whose people are in a state of permanent revolution." The counsel of tho .Ma - i ...an journalist has been heeded. We hearulinost.it the same moment of Maker 1'acha's apisiintincut as Superintendent of Mesopotamia, und of the successful movement of the Irish con? stabulary upon three of the most ittsiginli. ant s|Makers who have taken part in the Irish war against lan.llniili.iin. Mr. 1'arnell thinks I hese at rests sue only the precursors of a suspension nf the ha* hcas rntptis. He may be right, but the value aad sigrilheaticc ul the present -tep are lint to be tneas ured by the predict inns of Mr. 1'arnell as to the fu? ture?save so far as his predictions may he tho off? spring of wholesome feais. It is now some months since the outbreak in Ire? land became agrarian iu character. Nothing is im.re curious than tor.mat k how merely pnlitteal and even religious mat ton have dropped oat of sight. 1 he Home Rohrs members unit ted St. Stephens with their mouths lull of < >bst rm-t ion and tin- m w Irish I'niversity f the latter being the price paid by the Government torat cm pm a ry mitigation of the for? mer. Fhtahedwithsomethinglitre a victory, they Mi'ight bhclrOOnetltOOnte, but they found their enli? st it tietifg much innre keen eboal ndaettone of rent than about the parliamentary sin ce.ses of their es? teemed n-presentai i vi s. Home Rule was us popular as ever, hut a Winter of dlM privation was before them, and tho cry for local self-govern? ment was saun drowned in the roar of indignation against landlords who are so un? patriotic as to desire their rents paid. The meet? ings held in different parts of Ireland have been re? ported in t he Knglish press with unusual fulness. They bud Hindi the same character everywhere. Little was said of politics in anv ehaae, ami much about bad harvests ami the land QOeetiOO. The temped of ipeakl rs and people alike gn u daily more violent. In England tbeee perfotaianeee seem to have a?tractei| the attention of everybody but her Majesty's Minisleis, who were ton much occupied In the promotion' of Impciialism in the four qaar> ten of the globe to attend to the distress ami die tiirb une m.inifestiiig themselves in these unpleas aut wars at home. At laat Lord Ileacnnsfiphl addressed a few words at the Guildhall to bis "brilliant brethren " across the (Channel. They were perhaps seriously meant, but they wero not very seriously taken. Nobody bettered tbe Government were going to act. Why should they T Or rather, why should they not have acted mouths ago, if at all f It is certainly some months?two at least ?i.ince people who concerned themselves about Ireland became convinced not im-relv thnt discontent was general?lor Irish dis? content is chronic?b.tl that there was every reason lo fear thai a period of real suffering was at hand. I he Irish themselves thought so, ami said so, ami Imed tie ir agitation upou the prevailing und i x jM-etcd misery of the poorer classes. Two courses were op-.-n to the Government. To suppress auiln t inn altogether is what no man expects to accom? plish iu Ireland. Cut it might have been Bolllfiod aid the sting taken out of it by timely in? quiry into the condition of the country and a promise of relief, in some form, for the most Draped distress. Ortho law mkdit have been put iu mil? lion upon the tir-t opt break of seditious oratory. A strong (toveiTimout might have ventured to do both ; but this Government did neither. They bnve allowed deotitattoo to reach a point where it thnateaa to become, in some districts, famine ; and they have tolerated language, whether troin the platform or the multitude, which was both sedi Uoaa toward the ClOWa aad menacing to every subject who bad the misfortune to own laud and the preeamption to expect rent lor it. Nor is it jret dear that theOoTOWeBt have made up.thcir mind to deal vigorou>ly with thetr dnRealtiea. The meeting at which Duvitt und his comiades held the language now complained of is aln-ady Dearly three weeka old. What they said is bitter enough, but uo more bitter nor fun her outside the law than many otffer liaraiigues before and since, l he chairman Went through the usual farce of ex? horting lhe Bpeakan to aae tenperate language advice which the speakers interpreted in tho usual l'ickw ickiiin sense. When the chairman ut? tered it, a bannet with the iiiseriptinn u the lead for the tillers; down with the land robbers." was stating him in the face. Davitt modelled his spec h ou this motto. 'I his patriot is nn ex-Fenian ; a martyr, whose martyrdom originally took the -ha;.1 fourteen vein I of penal servitude; since abridged hv tho tyrannical Saxon to eight ; D.tvitt lieing, in fact, at the moment a ticket-of leavi- man. Ho has found leisure in his years nf retirement to ma t tiro his views on political economy. He considers rent for land, whether in pros? perous times or bad times, an unjust and i m moraltaxoo theiadoetryof tho people.

Tiiey must have the land owned by the tillers; ateaatime,tenants ihoald oaly nay rani when they had a surplus utter everything else, and could afford it. It i- upon aaeh iaaaae rant as this that tho charges against Davitt are boa ft Whether his words are or are not legally seditious may he a question, hut wh ) b li ves that an Irish juiy will con viol upon then I Kill ni went further. 11? i> a barristerauit w is p >s-,hidesirous to see how m ar the w ind lie could sa.l. lie a Ivocated'a contisca'i .0 of the land in favor of the people; leaving to the people to say whether tho confiscation should bo effected by the pen, the pencil or tho sword. " Plenty of lead," answered the crowd. A priest interposed with a proie-t agmist physical force. Killen, following FariieU'.-i example-, said he did lint nOOfBBMBl it. bal he added that be would be glad to boo every man carrying u ritte ami know? ing how to useit. Which, ol course, ha- nothing to do with physical fo:< . # I should MppOM no man w ho has not the happi? ness to have a little Irish blood tu his veins could read Ihn sort of talk without rep ignai.ee; or with? out the I effect I oil that the cans - niu.il 1>. a bad one if it BOeda such advocacy aa Killen'* and I hunt's. Con the talk is neither better nor worse than w hut has been going od for months. Mr. Farm ll, it is said, has been studiously moderate; studiou-, any rate, to aay nothing himself which BOOld give the poljis- a hold on him. lint he is the leader of tine agitation; ho baa again aad agaiu been preeeut at meetings where murder hat been advocated ; ha is morally Tfopotislhie for the course things have taken. If the (.?vernimmt wanted to ptolaas I ?Oral i fleet, to signify to the [nag people, that their turbulence must stop short of crime, they could have done if efie. tually hv arresting Mr. PgfaalL A legal pretext would not have l>een wanting, and the fact that no ?eon viction could have been expected need not have dot.rred them in Mr. Pa r n c 11 's ease if it did not deter them in Davitt's and Killen's. These two uro men of no standing; in no sense,SO far aa oue In ar", ate they leaders; their offence docs not ex? ceed the offence of many other more prominent men, and the Irish will he likely to say that the Government did not berin with the leaders, because tin y dared nut. TbS arrest-, in one word, will do good, from the Government palatal view, only on condition ihat the polio J of repression, of which they are a sign, is pursued to the hitter end. If Mr. I'aniell can he silenced, Mr. I.owther may re? joice; hut the first Safest of the new p dicy is to elicit from Mr. Partiell a declaration that tho course of the Government, which Mr. I.owther represents in Ireland, is contemptihie and cowardly, and that Ireland is a country where no man's liberty is safe. The Home Pule Exsea'iVSil London is still more ex? plicit. Mr. O'Connor p..wcr. Mr. Fiuegan, and th'-ir comrades express their indignation at the fad that the fust response of the llrttish Government to the cry of distress in Ireland is the arbitrary arrest of three gentlemen engaged in defending the rights of tho suffering tenantry; and they regard thr-se. arrests as characteristic of the despotism, police rule and espionaue which prevail in Ireland, and they solicit contributions for a Defence Fund. The arrests were made by due process of law: they are no more arbitrary than any arrest of anv person ac? cused of crime is arbitrary ; and tho talk about des? potism is just fit 11 keep company w ith Duv'itt's about landlord-tyranny. Messrs. O'Connor Power k% Co. know this perfectly well 5 but they also know tiiat Bgitattna is not to be kept up by the use of reasonable language, and there is every s gn that the excitement produced by these occurrences will manifest itself in ;i Hood of words ou which the Government may, if it please, base a good many in? dictments. It will he placed in the pleasant di? lemma of having to bring lo trial great numbers of persons whom Irish juries will regard as heroes, or of modifying the purpose which it has just an? nounced. The measure it has now taken is one of those half measures which are signs of weak? ness rather than strength ; and it ia unhappily adopted at the moment wheu a display of decisiou and vigor WSJ most needed.
