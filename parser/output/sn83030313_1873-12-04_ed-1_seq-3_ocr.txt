WASHINGTON. Ken Butler Gives Pinchback a Chance for the Senate. Smith, cf Louisiana, Admitted to the House. DitrassioD in the Seiiete on Senator flor rill's Financial Scheme. Washington, Dec. 3, 1873. Butier'a Move To Put Plnctobark lu the Senate. Much to the surprise of everybody in the House to-day Butler moved to lay the resolution to ad mit Pinchback on the table. Alter some opposition from beck, who wanted to have a vote on It, the resolut.on was laid on the table. The object of this wove ol Butler's is undoubtedly to give PlnchbacK time to get into the Senate, failing in which ho will be admitted to the Qouse. The action of the House in the case clearly indi cates what may be expected from the great major ity which the republicans have in the body. Cox very indiscreetly made a party attack upon the republicans, thus making it a party question, with the result seen. Had he followed the course of latmar and other democrats on the West Virginia case, who never even once alluded to it as a party question, it is the general opinion that the result would have been similar. The Back Pay Mill and Its Chances. Home effort was made by several to get tho bill reducing the pay of members referred, but the House adjourned before taking any action thereon. It is evident the republicans believe that the re peal of the Increase of salaries will give their party a clear bill of health to cover over the Moblller and other irauds, and save the republican party. Mr. Hale, of Maine?doubtless inspired by his mentor, Hpeaker Blaine?is making himself particularly ?mclouB in the matter; but they will make very little capital by it, as, from present Indications, the democrats will vote as a unit for the Increase. The Old Committee on Foreign Relations To Be Continued?The Democrats, as Usual, Oet Two Committees. . The committee appointed by the republican Sen ate caucus to-day to revise the standing commit tees of that body have completed their duty. Although the committee decline to furnish Information to the press in advance of their report to the caucus, it hns been as certained from a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations that tho committee will be the same as at the organization of the Senate in March last?namely, Cameron, Chairman; Norton, Hamlin, Ilowe, Frelinghuysen, Conkhng and Scburz. Bout well, wno entered the Senate after the organiza tion of the committee in Murch, will go on either the Committee of Commerce or Finance. There will do probably 12 changes In ail. Vacancies are left in the list to be filled at the suggestion of the democratic Senators as heretofore, among which is the chair manship of the Committee on Engrossed Bills, for merly occupied by Mr. Casserly. The democrats being allowed the chairmanships of two commit tees?namely, the Private Laud Claims and En grossed Bills?Senator Tliurmau is now chairman ol tnc former committee. Liberal Republicans Object To Being Classed as Democrats. The liberal republicans have signified their wish that the republicans do not class them as democrats, aud will accept such places as may be assigned them on the committees by the caucus. Senator Sumner will, it is said, to-night be appointed ou a committee by the re publicans, perhaps as a member of a contem plated new committee. The Contract tor the Five Per Cent Loan Not To Br Renewed. The contract with tho bankers composing the syndicate for placing the Ave per cent loan expired on Monday last and will not be renewed. The Secretary of the Treasury will dctermtne in a lew days the plan of future operations. A Timely Reminder. As the republican senators were assembling to day in the ladies' reception room at the Capitol lor the purpose of holding a caucus, senators Gor don, of Georgia, and Ransom, of North Carolina, both democrats, who were not aware of the use the rooms had been for the time set apart for, at tempted to enter. The doorkeeper politely in formed them they could not go in. At tins Senator Ransom got indignant and asked the em ploye if he knew who he was, reminding him at the same time that he was a Seuator and had the right of access to the public rooms of the Senate. The parley blocked the way of those en titled to admission, and Senator Robertson, of South Carolina, learning tho cause, said:?"Let in the penitent sinners." The democratic Senators withdrew their demand lor admission and found more congenial atmosphere nearer the Senate chamber. Serenade to Horace Maynard. Representative Horace Maynard, of Tennessee, ?was serenaded to-night Ht the Ebbltt House. Among those in the room adjoining the balcony from which he spoke were President Grant and several members of the Cabinet and h number of Senators and Representatives. In the course of his remarks he said that the people of Tennessee would see lor themselvs whether the present agitation on the subject of Cuban affairs boded war or peace. They have read the protocol, which was honorable to the United States and not dishonorable to Spain, and will look to the President as a leader of peace in this transaction, while they will not forget the wisdom and caution of the Secretary of State through whom the instrument was consummated. Civil Service at Cincinnati and St. I.ouls. Tlie President has designated Surveyor it. H. Stevenson and Assistant Treasurer Wiiiiain E. Davis to be associate members of rhe Civil Service Hoard at Clncinnari, and Assistant A. 0. Edwards and Deputy Surveyor H p. Wytnan to be associate members or the Board at St. Louis. Mr. Charles Lyman, of the Treasury Board, win act as substitute for the Chief Examiner in the examinations soon to be held in St. Louis and Cincinnati. The candi dates for examination in St. Louis, about 70 in number, are summoned to appear on the eth tnsu Capture of Tltieves in the Indian Ter rltoi y. Telegrams received here announce the capture 1 by Lieutenant Kerr, of tho Sixth cavalry, with 20 men of Company K, Sixth cavalry, of a number of thieves, who have been depredating in Indian Ter ritory for sonio months, running off|stock stolen from Kansas into Texas and from Texas Into Kan sas and Missouri. Lieutenant Kerr and his force acted us a posse comltaius to assist a deputy mar shal in serving warrants upon the gang, fbey were eight in number, and were surrounded bv the marshal and the troops near Oatdn Creek, Indian Territory, having with them 7o horses and mules and about aoo cattle. No shots were flred, as the thieves made no resistance. They were taken Into custody by the marshal, and will be tried tor grand larceny by the civil eoorts. The troops protected the raiders alter their capture, as scvcralTexaiis who discovered their property in the hands of tho gang were disposed to execute aummury ven geance without waiting for legal trial. Senator Morrill's Predilection for Stiver. Heaator Morrill, who waa for years a country trader at Strafford, Vt,, and whose financial edu cation constated in buying butter cheap, to be paid tor In caiico at high rates, is out against Inflation and In favor of a return to lourpcncu-haltpennie* and nlnepcnnics of silver. Good for Vermont, perhaps, but not for the Union. In Favor of Baron Bolleati's Pardon. The nmnv friends here of Huron daaldree do Hoilenn. who waa Secretary of tho French Lega tion and then French consul General at New York, #>nt Who is better known is a aon-in-law of Colonel Benton, are endeavoring 10 secure his pardon, lie was sentenced, it will bo remembered, to Imprison men*, iot nliving ofnefaffy endowed the Fremont Southern Pacific Railroad scheme, but no one who knew him believes thai he was aware of the lraudulent nature of the acheme. Opposition to InvelnnMrjr Baakraptcy. There is to be a stormy effort made to secure the repeal of the bankrupt law provision for involun tary bankruptcy, as recommended by the Presi dent, but it will be resisted by many Congressmen whose political fliends have been lortnuate enough to get positions under the law, where they are umasslug large sums In the shape of fees. Secretary Kiih'l Document* Edited This Time. The official despatchea of Secretary Fish, which are to be published aa a portion of the documents accompanying the Presidents Message, will not be much If any over half as volnmlnous as were those of last year. They have been carefully edited and scrutinized by Assistant Secretary Davis, who bas taken care that no paragranlts have crept In, as in previous years, which have sadly disturbed Peiuente oorUiale with friendly Powers. The West Virginia Election, The validity of the election held In Angnst and October laBt in West Virginia came up In the House on a motion to admit Davis, who claims to have been elected In August, on the day of the adoption of the new constitution. Though Davis Is a democrat of the straightest kind he was op posed by several of his party, while, on the othpr hand, Uutler and other republicans supported his claim to u seat. The desire of the democrats who opposed his admission was to refer the legality of the August election to a committee. Though It seemed doubtful whether this would be accom plished it was finally done, owing chiefly to the very able speech of Lamar, of Alabama. The LouInIun* Disputed Election* The case of Smith and Davidson, of Louisiana, next came up* Davidson was a democrat and his case was championed by Cox and opposed by Bat ter. This is perhaps one of the most extraordinary cases that has ever come up in the House, and the decision of the House In admitting Smith Is one of tho grossest acts of usurpation that In all proba bility has ever occurred In a legislative body, ex ceeding, as a New York republican remarked In private, the worst acts of "Boss" Tweed's Legis lature In his palmiest days. It wus clearly showu that the certificate of election was given to Smith three days after the election, when there could by no possibility be any returns received to Justify or base his election on, the district tn which ho ran being 800 miles long and there being no railroad or telegraph by which they could be received in so short a time. 8ttll Strengthening the Naval Force in Cuban Waters. The Navy Department is still busily engaged in strengthening the forces at and about Key West and Cuba, and providing for a heavy force in these waters. Several of the most experienced engi neers In the service have been In con sultation with the Secretary with reler ence to the workings of the Engineer Depart ment. Nearly all the Important orders that are considered necessary In a time of emergency have been Issued; but there Is no Indication what ever of a relaxation of the energy that has charac terized the department since tho commencement or the Spanish complications. Official reports from the senior omcer at Key West represent the naval force there as strong and effective. Naval Orders. Lieutenant Sbarrcr Is ordered to the Hydro graphic Office at Washington, D. 0. Ensigns Ilalllday and Milton, and Midshipmen Daoney and Stanton are ordered to the Franklin.

LEGISLATORS ON THE MESSAGE. Washington, Dec. 3, 1873. The average sentiment ol members of Congress on the President's Message, al ter conversing with a number of Senators and Representatives, may be summed up as lollows:?It meets but faint praise as a State paper, and in many parts is severely criticised. Opening with what is regarded as a thinly disguised lament over the fall of Jay Cooke and the financial allies of the administration, a careful perusal discovers no allusion whatever to the loss by death oi the Chief Justice since the last meeting of Congress. A few local and isolated victories for the Grangers in re cent elections are expanded into an extinction or party lines in politics, and the personal audience granted by the Chinese Emperor to the foreign Ministers at his court Is given undue prominence in the Message. The motley crew sent to Vienna are dnbbed as practical artisans and scientists, against notorious tact3 to the contrary. A brief and non-committal paragraph announcing the application of President uaez lor a protectorate over the Dominican Republic puts the Samaria Bay speculation beiore Congress, where the parties in interest are left to do what they can In carrying through their scneme. So far as the Message reveals a state or peace with all the world but Mpalh it meets with ap proval, and the President's abstention from compromising allusion to afi'airs on our Mexican frontier is received in the same spirit, as is also the proposition to define und limit the citizenship rights of Americans, who practi cally sever themselves from the country and its lute rests. The suggestion that Congress shall be limited la its special sessions to such matters as are brought rorward by the Executive la not well received by the uioinbers 01 that body, but a larger measure oi acquiescence is given to the proposition that the President shaH be armed with power to veto ob jectionable parts of bills presented lor his ap proval. The discontinuance of extravagant appropria tions lor newlloss public buildings, and of har bor and river improvements not demanded by the general interests of commerce, is admitted to be a good recommendation; but, as part of the political machinery of the dominant party, they arc not llkeiy to be permanently eradicated from the legis lation of Congress. Ihe best praised feature of the whole document is the round treatment of the slavery question in Cuba; but regret is expressed by many that the document becomes ssdlv muddled In attempting to define and explain the relations o( the Casino Ka paftnl to the supreme government at Madrid. The financial topics oi the Message are the parts that have isjen the most anxlousiy read and that give the least satisfaction. The frank admission that tlioy are "simply thrown oot" saves them from the severer criticism tiufi wvuni have ivi lowed if they had laid pretension to tne cnaraeter or well digested propositions. But the point is made against the Message that nothing of soch grave consequence should be presented to Con gress and to the country in such a form that does not appear and claim to be the result of prolound study and competent advice. It is also charged against the Message that, In straining after an elastic currency, it loses sight of the evils of fluctuation altogether, and that a whole train of fallacies loilow the mistaken view that a circulating medium is wealth itself, and not a mere representative of wealtn, with silver deposed as a standard of value througnout the commercial world, and gold as a leading product of American industry on the Pacific slope. The Idea conveyed tu the Message, that they should be prevented Irom entering Into our exports and kept at home till cheapened enough to admit of specie resumption, is received by the business men In Congress as a startling proposition in political ecououiy. The Idea that the business of the country can be taken in hand by Congress and its speculative elements eliminated by legislation is similarly ridiculed. v Pre?iUng opinion seems to be that the effect of the financial parts of the Messuge, so far as auy efleot can he predicted, will bo to strengthen the cause ol lree banking by exposuig the futility of government Interierence, actual or proposed, with the banking system of the country. An uninten tional slap is given to the Freed men's Bank, with Its numerous Southern branches, in the statement that the volume of currency is virtually contracted by the habit of the ireedtnon of hoarding or carry v&t'&yateig i" BOmcwhat leugthy objection to the BanK refurn fhil?now aU5',|H> i? characterized us a j I .tvj opening plaint In oebalf of Jay Cooke.

EXTRACTS FROM THE DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENCE. Important Points In International Rela tions Presented by tbe United States Ministers to Foreign Powers. Washington, Doc. 3, 1873. The following extracts are made from the diplo matic correspondence: tn?f^ niIU8t?r 10 tne Argentine Republic reports to the Department ol dtate certain difficulties and obstructions which militate against an increase of commeroe between the United States and the nf iHra f countries. Not to speak of the want 2L.d,??t Bteam communication, he mentions, first, the necessity that all irelght sent by steamer Isew ^ork to the River Plato must be landed at Kio, pay various custom House charges and pass a tedious Custom Mouse process. Kven the houses oi business that have responsible agents at Rio have their goods delayed there from two to four months, hlx mouths is not au unusual delay lor packages ol valuable merchandise which have been shipped by steamer in hope of a quick arrival. The second obstruction is the neglect and refusal ol the United States line of steamers from New Tork to Kio to encourage the quick passage of freight and malls to the River Plate. Ii the mails could arrive regularly and promptly it would enable merchants to place a groator confidence in their transactions with their correspondents In the States, and conse quently increase the amount of these transactions. It small packages of merchandise, and especially samples, could be sent by steamer without anv de lay at ltio, it would cause a very large increase of orders lor certain classes of goods, and create a market lor many articles that are now practically excluded from these countries. It is understood, although our Minister cannot speak with certainty, that the cost to Brazil alone in the Paraguayan war was not less than $000,000,000. The independence of Paraguay is nominal rather than actual. The obligation Im posed upon her people by the recognition of the meet! datnmtJ'111 *ar beyond their abllitj to Minister Low informs the Department of (State wvira!1 n Prl?ce and Ministers of China have on several occasions expressed their satisfaction at the generous and kind reception of the 80 Chinese students who lelt In June last for the United . tates, and tne sending of the second instalment two months earlier than the date originally fixed ti?*n the undertaking has thus far more than met the expectations of its promoters. ti.u\ ?Epa?f" M?m tlM diplomatic correspondence that the Haytlen government, In August last, ex pressed Its desire for a treaty of peaco with 8t. .^o?l?*l0? llie Dominican government reiused to listen to the proposition until the May Mens shall have plainly shown by their acts that they desire to live as good neighbors. man/ Af'nl?U)r to Ecuador suggests the establish ment of American shipping connections as the means requisite for the restoration oi .Spanish American commerce. Ttie matter ol Imports will amount to nothing wheu such lines are afforded As naturally as rivers seek the sea will Spanish-Amer ican commerce turn to North American marts when the proper aqueducts are afforded. Our Minister at Berlin says the Merman govern ment would probably take measures lor such a change in the I&wh an would subject emigrant agents to more stringent control, ir not prohibit them altogether. Meanwhile, tbo Saxon govern ment, without awaiting the result of the delibera tions of tue government of the Umpire, has airendv Issued au order expelling from its territory all agents of emigration who do not possess the riant oi Uerman citizen ship. B The .Secretary of state, In June last, addressed a letter to our Minister at the Hawaiian Islands against the importation of coolies, sayinir it is a grave consideration for the the government of those islands whether they wi/l *0 far brave public opinion elsewhere as to incur the imputation of countenancing that which is virtually the slave trade, under another name, Tor the purpose of sup plying the labor demand.

At half-past twelve o'clock Mr. MoKaii.L, (rep.) of VC, began to address the Benate on Ins resolu tion offered on Monday. Instructing the Committee on Finance to consider the expediency of reporting a bill providing tor free hauklng and resumption of specie nay merit on January l, 1874. Mr. Morrill said It might not be the best tlmo for discreet legislation during a panic, out in view of our notes b?tug so nearly at par now, the ready markets for all our products, Ac., he thought It would be Inexcusable neglect on the part of oar leinslalors not to tako advantage of all concurring circumstances now to return to specie payments. Xhe people should be relieved of the anxiety of fluctiiatifins of paper ffiJrKnSyT' "What brdker would have ventured at the close of oar war in 1806 to have predicted that nine long yt-grq would elapse and not bring our currency to a specie 'standard? Mow could It be deuiauded of the Sec retary of the Treasury to onuuclate any flnan oli Clal policy while Congress remained silent? lie would not attempt to Place gravel in the shoes of the adnilnistration, oht n? w5utd endeavor to stir up the ambition of all, and especially that or the present congress to lift the country out of the preseDt slough of depreciated currency. On tins huandal subject tbo people expect Congress to lead the way. It is the duty of the government to Jirovido a sound currency, not oniy for itseli bat or the people. Our commerce Is to be regulated by Congress, but It can only be regulated through toe instrumentality of a sound currency. Could Congress shirk the duty of statesmen and in definitely postpone the day ol our deliverance troru depreciated paper currensy 7 He did not dare to hope tuat he would be able to remove the objec tions lingering in the minds of many, but wonld try to show the evils arising from our present con dition. Our experience does not differ trom that or other couotries. It was easy enough to plunge Into a paper currency, out the return was difficult. Paper money (so-called) is not redeemable at the will or the owuer, is not money. It bad been claimed that our paper had not depreciated, but gold had risen lu value. The same thing had often been said before with us. It could not be reasonably claimed that gold had risen Ui value, when it is so notorious that its influx rrom the Pacific coast and lroui Australia had decreased its value. Borne had gone so lar as to claim that the government might transfer tts whole indebtedness into the semblance of money bnt they lorgot the manly utterance of General Grant's inaugural. Again the champions of a paper currenoy appeared with their argument of the confidence the people have In the government. It la not a question of doubt of ability, but a ques tion of the intention of the government to pay. There was plenty or confidence in the ability of the government to pay, but, unfortunutely, Congress wonld not let it pay. The perperual flow ol gold abroad had been a perpetual advertisement ol the aepreciatlon of our currency. All ol oar bonds find theiT highest appreciation in specie paying markets abroad, and he most ask how long tins state ol affairs must continue. Shonld no effort be madeto care it, our depreciated currency would be handed down from generation to generation as an Incurable malady. Let the growing suspicion that no steps are to tie taken towardB the resumption of specie payments go on, ana we shall surely recede from such payments, lie reierred to the banking rates now being in excess of those of years ago. and said the poorest money is always the dearest. The expansion of paper currency shipwrecks many undertakings which might have been successful witn a sound currency. Alter referring to tho banks locking up such sums as a part ot their re serve, thus reducing the amount of money in the hands of individuals, he spoke of the inconvenience to which the mercantile community was con stantly subjected by the large operators in Wall street. He did not approve of the proposed Issue ot government bonds interchangeable witn United Stares notes, and thought the promoters or that scheme sought an Indefinite expansion of the currency. The seductive influences of an excessive paper currency were terrible. Some seemed to be willing to trust to time and nature to cure our financial evils. With all due respect to time and nature, he was unwilling to hand the matter over to be cured. Congress must be equal to Its consti tutional duty. Tbe people, who are deficient in neither strength nor courage, long to say Ameri can money is second to none in the world. They long to handle once more the sound cash, and sec the vain attempt to compete with paper against the bard money of the world. What further degra dations awaited us t No one could telL Where, outside of our own country, does our money pass at part Nature bad bestowed upon our land with a lavish abundance the precious metal, but it seemed as if we had failed In converting it into a circulating medium. Our depreciated currency, or money, not being genuine, or as good as it onght to be, was held by the people without being frugal, and was working ruin to the morals of the nation. Labor, cheated In every contract, was disgusted, and work seemed to be going out of fashion. Lounging was the antocrat of the times. How could we expect to train up a conscientious people when the government itself gave a bad example by the issue and reissue of paper currency above its vainer With a return to specie all obstacles to iree banking would be removed, and the legitimate business of banking would be restored tw all parts of the country: but these reforms con id not be brought about without the aid of Congress. He was not wedded to any special plan, but lavored that proposed by a prominent financier of New York, that the Secretary of the Treasury shall Issue certificates payable In four years, witn Interest at 3.t)6, at par, in United States notes or gold, at the option of the Holder, requiring the banks to weep one moiety of their reserves in these certificates, and lor the government to give notice that on January 1, 1875, it will pay ita notes in cash ia New York, anthorizlng the government to nego tiate a loan of 200,000,000 in coin at six per cent per annum. Tue certificates, as fast as re deemed, may be paid out by tho Secretary of tbe Treasury to satisfy claims against the government. The return to specie payments would, of course, be attended by some inconven ience, but a reasonable time hud notice being given the notes would gradually approach par. All sound banks would be glad to return to a specie basis. A lew mushroom institutions might not be able to stand, but no one would regret rhcir loss. He thought the republican purty had done much towards advancing the national prosperity, ! and the work of specie payment was the only one not yet attempted. "It would ixj an honor when this nark cloud of greenbacks should be swept away, and he hoped soou to submit a bill providing lor the desired return to a specie basis. Mr. Ferry, (rep.) of Mich., moved to take up the resolution offered by hiui on Monday to provide for the settlement ol the financial derangement. Mr. Wright, (rep.) of Iowa, moved tnat the Senate proceed to the consideration of executive business, witn the understandingth.it Mr. Kerry be entitled fo the floor*ou his resolution to morrow. Agreed to. Mr. Stevenson. (dem.) of Kv., presented a pe tition of 8,500 citizens ol Kentucky, asking lor tnc passage ol a law pronibltidg the manufacture of spirituous liquors in the territories of the l ulled .states. i he senate, at two o'clock, went into executive session. After 20 niiuutes the doors were re opened and the Senate adjourned until to-morrow.
