WORK ON APE. STEIN A CO.'S BOOKS. The examination of the affairs of Abe. Stein & Co.. who fail-1 for more than H.MMM last week, was continued yesterday by David Wile, the re? ceiver. A large force of clerks and several expert accountants were kept busy. Mr. Wile said that he had nothing to add to the statement made by him on Baturday. He said that it would take | long time to get the accounts and affairs of the Atm untangled. "The action." said Mr. Wile, "of the London and Uiver Plate Hank, the British Bank of South America and the German Bank, of London, in bringing suit against me as receiver, enjoining me from disposing- of certain warehouse receipts, waa not unexpected." Abe. Stein is now on his way to the United States. It is expected that he will be able to ex? pedite the work of the receiver. Judge Bischoff, of the Court of Common Pleas, yesterday ordered David Wile, receiver of the property of Abe. Stein & Co., to show cause on December 7 why he ahould not tie enjoined from parting with the property of several foreign cred? itors, who claim certain goods shipped to the firm In trust. The German Bank, of London, claims 40ft bales of skins on trust certificates; the British Bank of South America. 4o? bales, and the London and River I'late Bank, 267 bales. The repre&eiit.. thres of the banks have demanded these goods from the receiver without success. MINOR BU SIN CM COMPLICATIONS.

Chicago, Dec. 4.?Two more citizens summoned i to appear for Jury service in Judge Tuthlll's court to-day answered satisfactorily all the searching Interrogatories put to them by Court and counsel touching the Cronin case. The third man, Oscar V. Brooks, was passed Saturday, so that the places of the ex-jurors. Gates, Wilson apd Behm are filled. The three new Jurors are of a much higher order than their predecessors, and all live ta suburban towns. One, George P. Sharp, an Oak Park druggist, ls a university grsduate; another, C. Holzman, Of Park Ridge, ls a well-to-do real estate dealer, who told a friend after being sum? moned that he "hoped he would not have to serve" en account of the time lt would take from his business. The acceptance of the three as jurors Was followed by a consultation between Court and couaeel. at which the attorneys agreed to Judae Tuthlll's measure of precaution that the trio should not be sworn In until to-morrow morn? ing, when the other nine Jurors will be present. In the mean time, city detectives will make sure that the new Jurors are all right. They were ordered kept under guard at the hotel apart from the nine who have been sworn in. Mr Scanlan, on behaJf of the State, will out? line the evidence to be presented to the jury when court opens to-morrow morning, and he expects to speak about two hours.

H ls understood that Alfred S.

The question whether Dr. Paxton will continue to be pastor of ,,,.. West Presbyterian Church will Probably be Anally nttled thia evening, when the Board of Trustees of the church win meet. AH the members of th. board are reticent, and from this very fact the conclusion is drawn by many that Dr. Paxton's resignation will be accepted.

The argument that Dr. Paxton's health is shattered trill have no waight with them.

At all events, should his resignation be accepted, the vote win by no means be unanimous. Edward H.

Th" main points of the interview are substantially correct, but the lan guage is distorted an*i exaggerated. My uncle never said thai if he went bach to New-Tork ii would only be to kill somebody.

"I hardly know whal to cull his ailment. How? ever, 1 know he ls very nervous, and I suppose if his pre?ent inness continue.! it would brui in ner? vous prostration." "Is it true that he fears softening of the brain or paresis?" "Pshaw, that ls all bosh. He never said that." "Do your folks entertain any such fears0" "No, we do liol. \\'?* know that lie needs rest, and that ls what he ls here for. He has never fully recovered from the operation he had to un? dergo some time ai;o. and lt has left him very weak He win remain here until he recuperates In a year or two he will probably go on Um lecture stage and travel awhile. He has been here ever since he came from New-York and. with the ex ceptlon of half a day which he spent with his brother in Canonsburg. has no*, been out of the house save io take a wu Ik about the farm." ' Ho you know anything of his interview with Trustee Perkins"*" "1 only know that he had such an Interview, but what occurred I cannot mv, I only Know that Dr. Paxtor. maintain*, thai he has bad no trouble with his congregation, and that his only motive for resigning v.-a? for th" betterment of bis health."

Their fears may have been increased yesterday hy a rumor that tin- police Commissioners and superintend? ent wei-.- talking of transferring them to other ->re clnets. Color to tba repori was given yesterday afternoon, arbes Commissioners Harlin .md Mc i'lave and Superintendent Byrnes held a long con? sultation In Mr. llcClave's room behind closed doora. They would t. ll nothing about the consul. tritton later, except thai it concerned matters of police discipline. The Police Hoard will meet this afters ion. .nd there may be nome transf-rs of captains. There are several reasons wiry a "vhalie-up" of th'- captains might be ordered just now. The re? moval of captains from prei Incts li which tbey have failed to c!o?e disorderly houses and gambling dens might frighten th" violators of law into tem iiu.ir. inactivity, al least, and stop some of the complaints which the Rev. Pr. Parkhurst says ar. being sent to him and to other members of his ?OClety even tey. H might also save some of those aame captains from indictment on charges brought by the society. Captain Devery, who i> to have the support an'! encouragement of the officials upon his trial, could be moved from his precinct more easily, without prejudice to his case, If other captains were transferred at the same linn-. The Commissioners may not wish to defy puidic opinion by keeping Devery In charge of the Lldi idge-st. force while he is being tried A gen? eral transfer of captains also might Strengthen the position of the Commlsslon-rs ar.d of Superin? tendent Byrnes in the estimation of the pu Mic. There hus heen much mieaslng in the department since Dr. Parkhurst announced thal the society's warning to Captain Dohcrtj might soon be fol? lowed By a warning to another captain In whose pre,luci are many disorderly houses. Complaints are known io have t.n inri.'.-* about such houses In the Fourth Precinct, commanded by Captain Si.-vin. whose station ls In o.tk-st., In the Sixth precinct, west of the Bowery, where Captain Wurta holds swhi , in the i-'ifi tenth Precinct, com? manded by Captain Haughey, and in the N'tn"tepnth Precinct, the well-known "Ti-ndertoln" district, the commander of which la Captain O'Connor. The captains yesterday denied that they had received ooy notlc from Pr Parkhurst, and they declared thal there was no cause for complaint about housea In theil precincts. Captain Doherty, who has teen activ in raiding . e in his precinct since bs received tbe eonety's warning, said yesterday: "l am docing up disorderly places as fast a? I <*an get the evidence I i s inrnnt mst, but what of thru'' l hid shut up sixty-four such places i?r,,r,. the society sent a notice i . me. gtod nothing was said about the work I was doing then. As f.1-d as theae dlaorderij people are turned out of one place they g.. !?? another place, and the work has to be done ovei tgaln wa can't kill these people, or keep ihem shut up nil the time."

Flint A Co. yesterday, saying that the Braalllan cruisers Nlctheroy and America sailed from that port In companv on Sunday night. They tailed under sealed order-, .ind it ls not known what port they are destined for. It ls. however. safe to say that the Krazillan port to which they are ordered ls either Pira. I'ernambuco or Rio. The odds are in favor of their trying to make Rio. They will probably try to dodge the Aquldaban and ile Republics, and as they "Carry the dainty Hotchkiss gun An ! a pair of keels with which to run," they tun.I a good chance of doing so. The America and Nlctheroy wera to have sailed un Saturday night from St. Tte.mas. hut did not ge* away until Sunday night Whin they are next heard from they will probably have a siory to tell.
