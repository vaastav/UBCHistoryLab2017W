C. , Dec. in. The house Aliened today with n sharp contest between the ways and means and appropriations committees , but It was brief and decisive and resulted In a victory for the former com mittee For some time there has been a lit tle rivalry between these two great commit tees of the house , and when the matter of ascertaining the condition of the treasury umler llm operation of the McKlnluy law became a pertinent question Immediately after election this rivalry was accentuated by the dispute- to which committee should conduct the invcstlg.ulon. Mr. Dockery ol the appropriations committee introduced : ' resolution assigning this duty tb the coni' mlttee of which Uo is a member , and a few days later Mr. Wilson of thu ways anil means committee presented a resolutioi directing the committee upon which wouli fall the burden of originating rovemu legislation for the relief of a depleted treasury ury to conduct the Inquiry. Both resolu lions went to the committee on rules , am that committee today reported Mr. WIl son's proposition , thus conferring Jurisdlctioi on the ways and means committee.

( New York Herald Cable Special to Tin : Hr.i.l : The crisis which 1 predicted in my dispatches of yester day has happened. M. Kouvler , minister of finance , has handed In his resignation , and In a way dramatic enough , at the session of the Chamber. All that he said proves nothing , for what he said was con trary to. fact. He confessed that he bad been at the house of the late Hiron : do licl- nach , and because be was ignoraM of the prosecutions. Hut thu prosecutions had been decided upon In thu ministerial council at which M. Heavier assisted eight days lie- fore the suicide of the Baron de Helnach. M. Clemenceru was upon thu point of speaking in order to explain his own con duct but ho was restrained by his friends. That was a mistake , for an explanation had been expected. Sonic Singular Statement * . I am advised thai the situation of the ministry generally Is shaky. It is inad missible that the other ministers did not know of the conduct of their colleague , the minister of finance- . Moro than that , they have lied from the beginning , since every ono of them has declared from the tribunu that do Heinach was not poisoned , when they knew to the contrary. Should the whole cabinet resign It is impossible to say who will succeed. Nobody wants to take the re sponsibility , The position of President Carnet is also very shaky. It must not ho forgotten that ho also knew all about the poisoning through .tho prefect of police , and that ho knew of the situation In which M. Uouvier was placed from the hitter's own confession. It was his duty to have prevented him taking ofllco in the new government , and from continuing to tell falsehoods , but the difficulty Is greater for the republic than for the president of the council. The eaudi- date having the greatest is M. Henry Bris- son , but he evinces no presidential quality. . - pli'iuilil Clianco I'nr Triiiilil , ' . As 1 have kept the readers of the Herald well informed from day to day of the courst of events since December 2 , they know thai the situation in Franco is bad. The bourgeoisc and the people aVe republican enough , but let us see if wo are going to assist at ai evolution , either reactionary or socialistic. Anti-semitism stands for disorder , and if II believes that its hour was at hand , it would bring about a new scandal greater and more disgusting than any and things would cm' up in the death of .liberty. There is one anti-semite who is jubilant He is M. Drumont , who has for years pasi been denouncing as scandalous the conduct f deputies , llimneiers and ministers. The committee of inquiry will tomorrov lear M. Houvier , M. Constans and M. Clem enceau. The successor of M. Houvier as minister o finance will bo M. Tirard , formerly presidon of the council. The nomination will be inadi ufllcially tomorrow , when the republieai roups will try to reorganize. .l.\co.ris : ST. Cum : . -.irui > iitii : : >

( New York Herald Cable Special to Tin : Uiu. ] Within the last few- weeks , as is well known , the relations be tween the Vatican and Hussla , though not grown so close as to warrant belief In the near reunion of the Greek and l < utin churches , have become extremely cordial. The visit of Grand Duke Sorguis was a symptom of this friendliness. I now learn that the peed will of thu Vatican toward the govern ment of the czar has not been confined to words , hut he has found practical expression in a brief to the Polish bishops , in which they are exerted to abandon and discourage all insurrectionary tendencies and submit to the will of Providence , which has made them subjects of the czar.

Herto induce him to Use his Inllucnce to stop the attacks that were being inade upon Baron de Helnach. M. Her/ informed them that H was not in his power to stop these attacks , and his vis itors left. M. Houvinr. in acknowledging Unit the statement of M.

Paul de Houlde , fanner president of the suppressed Patriot league , made a violent attack upon M.

Houvier responded to M. do Houlde , saying that ho was ready to answer in any court any charge thnt'.lmd been or might bo made against him , and'tbatho ' would only re peat what he had said , M. Houvier added that he had visited Baron de Heinach solely from motives of humanity. He declared that a section of the press was taking advantage of the Panama affair to U'row slurs upon all republicans who are in i ver. He would be able to resume his placi ; as a simple deputy and could hold his bead high , with the sense that his honor had noc been sullied. This closed the incident , though it was thought at the time that it migfit lead to serious con sequences , i The lobbies and ( jallc'ries of the chamber were crowded Ihrolip'hYml the sitting , every one expecting a crisis that would result in the overthrow of the government. The resignation of M. Houvier will prob ably result in an extension of official life to the Hibot cabinet. Shortly after M.
