THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE. the our the the The house has promptly autl unan imously set apart Dee. 12th for the consideration . of .-the civil service question. This seenw to be in line with Senator Frye's pungent: com ment, that "during the last campaign both parties seemed -to- be- running a race with civil service reform as the goal, and now both have a splendid opportunity to prove to the specta tors that the race was no , put-up job." ; . Tlu congress favorably re- and the as "com- ie message is very ceived both by press. Such expressions prehensive," "suggestive, "strong, "sound," "sagacious, "patriotic, "wise," etc., put the general verdict in a nut-shell. The worst thing that the democratic press can say of the message is that it is "too long." It is not of unusual length, however, and considering the size of the coun try and the vast interests of o0,000, 000 of people, it could not well be shorter without failing to do justice to the subject.. The ways and means, committee of the House has voted 6 to 5 to abol ish the tax on tobacco. It is notice able that Pennsylvania and Virginia furnished nearly all the votes in the affirmative. This shows that the high protectionists and free traders have struck hands to accomplish this result. The alliauce will fail. The rest of the country has too many votes and too much sense too see to bacco relieved of taxation before the necessaries of life are relieved. The matter goes over for a week, which will be a losing week for the over- zealous friends of the weed. Secretary Folger does not endorse the recommendation of the message to abolish the tax on tobacco and fermented liquors. "They are in the main," he says, "the means of indul gence, and should come before nec essaries as subjects of taxation." The Secretary of the Treasury recom mends a reduction in the tax on sug ar, which is "a necessary of life for all classes in this country," the whole tax on which is paid by the consumer. The Secretary estimates that the duty is equal to 22 cents per lb. That the Secretary's position is the correct one and ought to prevail needs no argument. THE 

MARRIAGE RELATION. It must have occurred to some who heard Rev. Mr. Dike last Sab bath evening, that the divorce reform league began its work of reform at the wrong end. If men were taught in early life not to make brutes of themselves by indulging every pas sion, or not to acquire habits of in temperance which make them worse than the brutes, there would be less occasion for the separation of hus band and wife. Following out the conclusions of the divorce reform league a wife must be tied to her drunken and brutal husband, if he be chaste, until as last, as is frequently the case, in his diabolical frenzy he butchers her in cold blood, or per haps kills her as surely of a broken heart : then she sets a divorce, but cannot have one till then. In Bible times there was but one cause for di vorce, but they did not then have whiskey that made fiends incarnate of men. The sensible way to reform the marriage state is to teach those liable to enter it the duties and responsi bilities involved in it. The assum ing of these relations in the thought less manner all too common, or sim ply as a matter of convenience, also too common, is a crime. . Neverthe less we believe there are lots of men and women living aS husbands and wives who should be separated for their own good and perhaps that of their posterity. Caledonian. Secretary Folger's report is the most important department report presented to Congress, inasmuch as he deals witli matters which are of vital interest to the business of the whole country. The details are main ly covered by the Pj-esident's mes sage, but the Secretary discusses at more length than the President the management of the public funds and especially the problem of how to pre vent the accumulation of a large sur plus in the treasury. In the first place he would abolish all internal revenue taxatiou excepting the taxes upon liquors and tobacco, which are legitimate sources of revenue and so regarded in all countries. As it is necessary to reduce the revenue some $1)0,000,000 more than would result from the abolition of the internal taxes he suggests that a substantial reduction of the tariff on sugar might be made, and that a part of the tariff burden on wool, iron and steel might also be removed. On the coarser grades of eotten goods he thinks that American manufacturers can compete with the rest of the world without protection, and reccommends that raw materials generally be admitted free of duty. He would also reduce the tariff, on silk goods. These par ticular reductions will not be palata ble, where certain industries are affected, but the substantial agree ment among public men, that it is time to equalize the tariff and do something to remove the burdens of taxation and reduce the treasury sur plus ought to have its effect. If Congress could consent to drop po litical figuring out of the account and address itself industriously to the work of revision something worth while might be accomplished, even though it should prove only experi mental. .

' " A full and interesting exhibit of the operation of the treasury depart ment is afforded by the report of the secretary. It appears that the ordi nary revenues from all sources for the fiscal year ending June 30, .1882; were as follows : From customs, $220, 410,730 from internal revenue, $140,497,595; from other sources, $30,614,925 total ordinary receipts," $403,723,250. The ordinary expend itn res for the same period were : For civil expenses, $18,042,386; for for eign intercourse, $1, 307,583; for Indians, $9,736,747 ; for pensions, $01,345,193 : for military establish ment, including river and harbor im provements and arsenals, $42,570, 494 ; for the naval establishment, including vessels, machinery and im provements at navy yards, $15,032, 046 ; for miscellaneous expenditures, including public buildings, light houses and collecting the revenue, $34,539,237; for expenditures on account of the District of Columbia, $3,330,543 ; for intesest on the pub lic debt, $71,077,206. Total ordiria nary expenditures, $257,981,439. Leaving a surplus revenue of $145, 543,810, which, with an amount drawn for the cash balance in the treasury of $20,737,694, ' making $166,281,505, was applied to the re demption of bonds and other forms of debt. The foreign commerce of the United States during the last fis cal year, including imports and ex ports of merchandise and specie, was as follows : Exports merchandise, $750,542,257; specie, $49,417,479; total, $799,959,736. Imports mer chandise, $724,639,574 ; specie, $42, 472,490; total, $767,111,964. Ex cess of imports over exports of mer chandise, $25,902,683. This excess is less than it has been before for any of the previous six years. Dur ing the year there have been organ ized 171 national banks, and of these institutions there are now in opera tion 2,269, a larger number than ever before. The value of their notes was $325,656,458. In respect to the coinage of silver dollars and the retirement of silver certificates, I have seen nothing to alter but much to confirm the senti ments to which I gave expression last year. A comparison between the respective amounts of silver dol lar circulation on November 1, 1881, and on November 1, 1882 shows a slight increase of a million and a half of dollars, but during the inter val there had been in the number coined an increase of twenty-six mill ions. Of the one hundred and twen ty-eight millions thus far minted lit tle more than thirty-five millions are in circulation. The mass of accum ulated coin has grown so great that the vault-room at present available for storage is scarcely sufficient to contain it. It is not apparent why it is desirable to continue this coinage now so enormously in excess of the public demand. - You cannot fail to note with inter est the discussion by the secretary as to the necessity of providing by leg islation some mode of freeing the' treasury of an excess of assets." In the event that congress fails to reach an early agreement for the reduction of taxation, I heartily approve the secretary's recommendation of imme diate and extensive reductions in the annual revenue of the government. It will be remembered that I urged upon the attention of congress at its last session the importance of reliev ing the industry and enterprise of the country from the pressure of unnec essary taxation. It is one of the tritest maxims of political economy that all taxes are burdensome how ever wisely and prudently imposed, and though there . have always been among our people wide differences of sentiment as to the best methods of raising the national revenues and indeed as to the principles upon which taxation should be based there has been substantial accord in the doctrine that only such taxes ought to be levied as are necessary for a wise and ; economical administration of the government. Of late the pub lic revenues have far exceeded that limit, and unless checked by appro priate legislation, such excess ; will continue to increase from year to year. For the first fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, the surplus revenue amounted to $100,000,000x. For the fiscal year ending on the 30th of last June the surplus was'.more than $145,000,000. It was made appar ent in the course of the animated discussions which this question arous ed at the last session of congress that the policy of diminishing the reve nue by reducing taxation command ed the general approval of the mem bers of both houses. I regret that because of conflicting views as to the best methods by which that policy should be made operative none of its benefits have yet been reaped. In iumiimeni oi wnat l deem my con stitutional duty, but with little hope that I can make . valuable contribu tions to this vexed question, I shall proceed to intimate briefly my own views in relation to it : Upon the showing of financial con dition at the close of the last fiscal year I feel justified in the' recom mending to congiess the abolition of internal levenue taxes except those upon tobacco in its various forms and upon distilled spirits and fei- mented liquors, and except also the ; special tax upon the manufacturers of and dealers in such articles. I venture now to suggest that unless it shall be ascertained that the probable expenditures of the government for the coming year have been undes estimated, all internal taxes save those which relate to distilled spirits can be prudently abrogated. It seems to me, however, for various reasons, so. sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present be an unwise step. Two of these reasons are de serving of special mention. First, it is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties on imports is continued without modification, these duties alone will yield suflicient revenue for all the needs of the gov ernment. It is estimared that $100, 000,000 will be required for pensions during the coming year, and it may be well . doubted , whether , the., maxi mum annual demand for that object has yet been reached: 'The present tariff system is iu many respects un just. Jt makes unequal distribution, hoth of its burdens and its , benefits. This fact was practically recognized by a majority of each house of con gress on the passage of the act cre ating the tariff commission. The re port of that commission will be plac ed before you at the begining of this session, and will, I trust, afford you such information as to the condition and prospects of the various com mercial, agricultural, manufacturing, mining and other interests of the country, and contain such sugges tions for statutory revision as will practically aid your action upon this important subject. The revenue from customs for the fiscal year end ing June 30th, 1879, amounted to $137,000,000. It has in the three succeeding years reached first $186, 000,000, then $198,000,000 and fin ally, as has already been , stated, $220,000,000, The income from this source for the fiscal year which will end on June 30th, 1883, will doubt less be considerably in excess of the sum last mentioned. ' If the tax on domestic spirits, is to be retained it is plain, therefore, that large reduc tions from the customs revenue are entirely feasible. While recommend ing this reduction I am far from ad vising the abandonment of the policy of so discriminating in the adjust ment of details as to afford aid and protection to domestic laboi But the present system should be so re vised as to equalize the public bur den among all classes and occupa tions and bring it into closser haiv mony with the present needs of . in dustry. The grounds that impelled me to withhold my signature from the bill entitled "An act making appropria ations for the construction, repair and preservation of certain works on rivers and harbors," which became a law near the close of your last ses sion, prompts me to express the hope that no similar measure will be deem ed necessary during the present ses sion of congress. Indeed, such a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to that which was lately urged upon your at tention. I am informed by the sec retary Qf war that the greater portion of the sum appropriated for the va rious items specified in that act re mains unexpended. I offer a sug gestion, which I trust will commend itself to the wisdom of congress. It is not advisable that grants of con siderable sums of money for diverse and independent schemes of internal improvement should be made -the subjects of separate and distinct leg islative enactments. It will scarcely be gainsaid, even by those who fa vor the most liberal expendiures for such purposes as are sought to be ac complished by what is commonly called the river and harbor bill, that the practice of grouping in such a bill appropriations for a great diver sity of objects, widely separated eith er in their nature or in the locality with which they are concerned or in both, is one which is much to be de precated unless it is irremediable. It inevitably tends to secure the suc cess of the bill as a whole, though j many of the items if separately con- sicierea coma scarcely tan ot rejec tion. By the adoption of the course I have recommended every member of congress when opportunity should arise for giving his influence and vote for meritorious appropriations would be enabled so to do without being called upon to sanction others undeserving his approval. So, also, would the executive be afforded thereby full opportunity to exercise his constitutional perogative of : op posing whatever appropriations seem ed to him objectionable without im periling the success of others which commended themselves to his judg ment. It appears by the secretary's re port that the available naval force of the United States consists of thirty seven criusers, fourteen single turret- ed monitors built during the re bellion, a large number of smooth bore guns and Parrott rifles and eighty-seven rifled cannon. "The cruising vessels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern armored vessels, and the armament by high power rifled guns. The reconstruction of our navy, which was recommended in my last message, was begun by congress au thorizing in its recent act the con struction of two large uuarmored steel vessels of the character recom mended by the late Naval Advisory board, and subject to the final ap proval of a new Advisory Board, to be organized as provided by that act. American commerce is one "of the utmost importance to the national welfare. Methods of reviving Amer iaan shipbuilding and of restoring tue United States flag in the ocean carry trade should receive the imme diate attention of congress. We have mechanical skill and abundant material for the manufacture of mod ern iron steamships in fair competi tion with our commercial rivals. Our disadvantage in building ships is the greater cost of labor, and in in sailing them, higher taxes and greater interest on capital. While the ocean highways are already mon opolized by our formidable competi tors, these obstacles should some way be overcome, and for our rapid communication with foreign lands we should not continue to depend wholly upon vessels built in the yards of other countries and sailing under foreign flags. With no United States steamers on the principle ocean lines or in any foreign ports, our facilities for extending our commerce are greatly restricted, while the nations which build and, sail the ships and carry the mails and passengers ob tain thereby conspicuous advantages in increasing their trade. The report of the postmaster-general gives evidence of the satisfacto ry condition of that department, and contains much valuable, data and ac companying suggestions ' which can not fail to be of interest. The infor mation which it affords that the re ceipts for, tthe" fiscal year have ex ceeded the expenditures must be very gratifying to congress and to the people of the country. At the last session of congress several bills were introduced into the house of representatives for the re duction of letter postage to the rate of two cents per half ounce. I have given much study and reflection to this subject and am thoroughly per suaded that such a reduction would be for the best interests of the pub lic. It has been the policy of the government from its foundation to defray as far as possible the ex penses of carrying the mails by a di rect tax in the form of postage. . It has never been claimed, however, that this service ought to be produc tive of a net revenue. As has been stated, the report of the postmaster general shows that there is now con siderable surplus in his department, and that henceforth the receipts are likely to increase to a much greater ratio than the necessary expendi tures. Unless some change is made in the existing laws, the profits of the postal service will in a few years swell the revenues of the government many million dollars. The time seems auspicious, therefore, for some reduction in the rates of postage. In my message of December last I referred to pending criminal proceed ings growing out of alleged frauds in what is known as the star route ser vice of the postoflice department, and advised you that I enjoined upon the attorney-general and associate coun sel, to whom the interests of the government were intrusted, the duty of procecuting with the utmost rigor of the law all persons who might be found chargable with those offences. A trial of one of these cases has since occurred. It occupied for many weeks the attention of the supreme court of this district, and was con ducted with great zeal and ability. It resulted in a disagreement of the jury. But the cause has been again placed upon the calendar and will shortly be retried. If any guilty per sons shall finally escape punishment for their offenses it will not be for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of the prosecution. I trust that some agreement may be reached which will speedily ena ble congress, with the concurrence of the executive, to afford the commer cial community the benefits of a na tional bankrupt law. No survey of our material condi tion can fail to suggest inquiries as to the moral and intellectual progress of the people. The census returns disclose an alarming state of illitera cy in certain portions of the country, where the provision for schools is grossly inadaquate. It is a moment ous question for the decision of 'con gress whether immediate and sub stantial aid should not be extended by the general government for sup plementing the efforts of private be neficence and of state and territorial legislation in behalf of education. The results which have thus far at tended the enforcement of the recent statue for the suppression of polyg amy in the territories are reported by the secretary of the interior. It is not probable that any additional leg islation in this regard will be deem ed desirable until the effect of exist ing laws shall be more closely ob sered and ' studied. I congratulate you that the commissioners under whose supervision these laws have been put in operation are encouraged to believe that the evil at which they are aimed may be suppressed without resort to such radical measures as in some quarters have been thought in- dispensible for success. The report of the commissioner of agriculture presents an account of the labors of that department during the past year and includes informa tion of much interest to the general public. The condition of the forests of the country and the wasteful man ner in which their destruction is tak ing place give cause tor serious ap prehension. Their action in protect ing the earth's surface, in modifying the extremes of climate and in regu lating and sustianing the flow of springs and streams, is now well un derstood, and their importance in re lation to the growth and prosperity of the country cannot be safely disregarded- They are fast disappear ing before destructive fires and the legitimate requirements of our in creasing population, and the total extinction cannot be long delayed'un less better methods than now prevail shall be adopted for their protection and cultivation. The attention of congress is invited to the necessity of additional legislation to secure the preservation of the valuable forests still remaining bn the public domain, especially in the extreme western states and territories, where the nec essity for their preservation is great er than in less mountainous regions, and where the prevailing dryness of the climate renders their restoration, if they are once destroyed, well nigh impossible. The civil list now comprises about one hundred thousand persons, far the larger part of whom must, under the terms of the constitution, be se lected by the president, either direct ly or through his own appointees. In the early years of the administra tion of the government the personal direction of appointments to the civil servace may not have been an irk some task for the executive, but now that the bureau has increased fully a greater hundred-fold it has become than he ought to bear, and it neces sarily diverts his time and attention from the proper discharge of other duties no less delicate and responsi ble, and which in the very nature of things cannot be delegated to other hands. In the judgment of not a few who have given study and reflection to this matter, the nation has out grown the provisions which the con stitution has established for filling the minor offices of the public ser vice ; but whatever will be : thought of the wisdom or expediency of changing the fundeinental law in this regard, it is certain that much relief may be afforded not only to the pres ident and heads of departments, but to senators and reresentatives in con gress. By discreet legislation they would be protected in a great meas ure by the bill now pending before the senate, or by any other which should embody its important features from the pressure of personal impor tunity and from the labor of examin ing conflicting claims and pretensions of candidates. I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be taken for the correction of the evils with the pres ent methods of appointment, and I assure you of my hearty co-operation in any measures which are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most appropriate term and tenure of the official life of the subordinate employes of the government, it seems to be generally agreed that whatever their extent or character, toe one should be definite and the other sta ble, and that neither should oe regu lated by zeal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortunes of an indi vidual. It matters little to the peo pie at large what competent person is at the head oi this department or that bureau if they feel assured that the removal of one and the accession of another will not involve the retire ment of honest and faithful subordi nates, whose duties are purely ad ministrative and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the success of any monoply, party or faction. I delare my approval of such legis lation as may be found necessary for supplementing the existing provisions of law in relation to political assess ments. in .July last 1 authorized a public announcement that employes of the government should regard themselves at liberty to exercise their pleasure in making or refusing to make political contributions, and that their action in that regard would in no manner a"ff ect their official statu s The closing year has " been replete with blessings, for which we owe to the Giver of all good our reverent acknowledgement for the unterrupt- ed harmony of our foreign relations, for the decay oi sectional animosi ties, for the exuberance of our har vests and the triumphs of our mining and manufacturing industries, for the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence and the conservation of the public credit, for the growth of the country in all elements of nation al greatness. For these and count less other blessings we should re-

Marvelous Care of Stone in the Bladder S .arfte Stones Removed by "Kennedy's Favorite Remedy." From the Pittfield Mass ) Eagle. Stone in the Bladder is at once a most annoying and very dangerous ailment ; but many most remarkable cores have of late been wrought by "Kennedy's Favor ite Remedy" tha invention of Dr. Kennedy, of Ron dout, N. Y. Anoiber striking case is now added to the list. Mr. Peter Lawler, of Dalton. Mass.. states in a letter to Dr. Kennedy tbat he had been troubled with bladder complaint for 14 years, and bad consulted at ditterent times seven physicians; but nothing beyond temporary allayment of the pain had been worked for him. Towards the end of last January Mr. Lawler called on Dr. Kennedy. Sounding him, the doctor "struck stone." He decided that Mr. Lawler should first try the "Favorite Remedy," so as, if possible, to avoid an operation. And here is the remarkable re sult : "Dear Doctor Kennedy The day after I came home 1 passed two gravel stones, and am doing nicely now. If you would like to see the stones I will send them to you." This letter bears date "Dalton, Mass., Feb. 6," and is signed "Peter Lawler." The stones, which are so large as to warrant for "Kennedy's Fa vorite Remedy" the claim that it is the most successful specific for Stone yet discovered, are now in Dr. Ken nedy's possession . Incidentally Mr. Lawler also states that the "Favorite Remedy" at the same time cured him of a stubborn case of rheumatism ; and it is a fact tbat in all affections arising out of disorders of the liver or urinary organs it is a searching remedy and works marvelous benefits.

PKESIDKNT ARTHUR'S MESSAGE. -j 1 President Arthur's message which was printed in Monday's Union, is a straightforward and business like pa per, and shows a vigorous practical grasp of the varied interests of the government. Its length renders it a sore trial to all who have to do with Duttinsr it before the public, but it must be remembered that the United States covers a good deal of ground and that even the briefest reference to all the matters properly claiming attention in the President's annual message necessitates a long document. But as a whole the message delivered Monday was one of the best state papers ever presented to Congress The President talks like a statesman, and his utterances are entirely above the level of partisanship. It is diffi cult to see how any one can object to his position on the great questions which he discusses, and his frank ness in dealing with such matters as j-, the river and harbor appropriations, the Star route trials, civil service re form and political assessments, is sure to -increase the public respect tor mm. v The President's treatment of the postal question is sound and wise, and he urges the adoption of two cent do mestic letter postage on precisely the same grounds which have been sug gested in our columns as forming the reason fo'r the reduction Two cent letter postage is what the people want, and that is the simplest and most di rect way of reaching postal reform. Nothing else will take its place, and now let Congress go ahead and do as people and President demand and ure. His discussion of the reduc tion of taxation is thoughtful, but in our opinion the wisest thing to do with the internal revenue taxes is to let the taxes on tobacco as well as those on whisky, stand for the pres ent. They are not necessities of life, and people who use them may aa well help pay the government expenses. The constitutional amendment sug gested to give the President the pow er to approve or veto specific items in appropriation bills without being obliged to approve objectionable ap propriations or veto those that are commendable, would be a step for ward, and that suggestion ought to be heeded. On the whole the mes sage is good common sense applied to both the principles and details of governmental matters. Union. Antoine Martin of Sheldon was killetl Monday at that place by the caving in of an embankment on the Montreal exten sion of the Portland and Ogdensburg road. He leaves a familly. (ONE, TWO AND
