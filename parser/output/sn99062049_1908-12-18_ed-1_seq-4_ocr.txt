BUILDINGS WRECKED BY BOMB Chicago Police Believe Bomb Thrower Designed to Wreck the Coliseum. WORK OF WOULD-BE REFORMER Plan to Prevent First Ward Ball Against Which Much Opposition Has Been Made. Chicago, Dec. 14 Two buildings were wrecked and windows were shattered for a block around by the terrific explosion of a bomb in an al ley in Wabash avenue, near Sixteenth street, lust night. At first it was re ported that several people bad iosi their lives in the ruins, but after searching until after midnight the po lice stated that they believed all had escaped. The wrecked buildings ad join tlie Coliseum, where the First ward bull, the annual revel against the holding of which this year much opposition has been made, is sched uled to be held to-night, and tho po lice ai-e working on the theory that the unknown bomb thrower designed to wreck the Coliseum in order to stop the ball. Was Heard for a Mile. The report of the explosion was heard for a mile. The congregations of Grace Episcopal church and of the Open church and guests of several nearby hotels rushed to the streets in a panic. A two-story frame building at 1513 Wabash avenue, which ad Joins the south wall of the Coliseum annex, immediately collapsed and took fire. The fire leaped across an area and spread to another frame building, which was also wrecked. Properties of the Coliseum stored in the two buildings added fuel to the flames. Crowds of excited people, be lieving that the great stone structure of the Colseum had been biown up, rushed to the scene. Intended for Coliseum. That the bomb was intended for the Coliseum and that it was an effort of some would-be reformer to make im possible the holding of the ball to night, the police express little doubt. Another theory is that the bomb was thrown as another chapter in the "gamblers' war," which has been marked by the firing of a series of bombs. The First ward ball has long been a source of contention between reformers and the promoters of the annual festival. Recently the pastor of a church in the neighborhood sought and failed to secure an injunction to prevent, the holding of the ball on the ground that it was prejudicial to the morals of the community. KAISER INSANE IS CHARGED. Wilhelm Suffering From Acute Reli gious Dementia, Says Report. Chicago, Dec. 15. The German press of Chicago has received trans lations of articles published by the Dresdener Naclirichten, the leading Conservative newspaper of Dresden, openly charging that Emperor Wil liam of Germany is insane. The publication avers that the em peror has an acute religious demen tia. According to the information the editors claims to have from attaches of the royal household, the ruler spends many hours in bed daily reading re ligious books and making prayers that are hours long. The emperor's ab normal mental state is said to have become apparent since the recent out burst of popular indignation against him. The emperor's refusal to grant audiences to his lifelong friend and counselor, Von Buelow, and his ex traordinary conduct towards mem bers of his household indicative of his suspicion that all of them were in some way connected with his humilia tion, are regarded as significant. The charge that the emperor ha. given most of his time to the contem plation of piety on his prie-dieu and refuses to consider matters of state has created a profound sensation and gives rise to guarded Intimations that the deposition of the ruier in favor of some other member of his family is not beyond probability.

Washington, Dec. 1G. President Roosevelt is expected to send to con gress a special message on the Pana ma canal, and in view of the recent charges made by some newspapers re­ garding the acquirement of the canal property the message will be an inter esting one. It is understood that the president will tell who received the money this government paid to the .liquidator ap­ pointed by the French courts, and that he will show that they were nearly all Frenchmen, disproving the allegation that the purchase money eventually went to an American syndicate that had gained control of the canal com pany's stock. One feature in the message is ex pected tn be t.he naming of the fee received by William Nelson Cronnvell as attorney for the French company Mr. Cromwell is understood to have received $200,(100 for his services, the hu st amount received by any one man in connection with the deal. This fee was passed upon by the French courts and was deemed to be not ex cessive. This statement will dispose of the rumors that have beeen in cir iai ion to the effect that Cromwell made from SI ,000,0(H) to $10,000,000 out of the deal. It is anticipated that the president will deal with the editors of some newspapers without glomes. Some he will name and accuse them of misrep resentation willfully. 

HARRIMAN GETS IMMUNITY. U. S. Supreme Court Says Commerce Commission Cannot Probe Magnate. Washington, Dec. 10.—In deciding yesterday the cases of Edward II. Harrinian and Otto H. Kahn vs. the interstate commerce commission, the supreme court of the United States held that the commission is not enti tled. under the interstate commerce law. to press questions relative to pri vate transactions, even though they involve dealings in the securities of interstate railroads, when the investi gation of which such questions are a part has been begun upon the commis sion's initiative. Tiie opinion of the court was an nounced by Justice Holmes and dealt with the refusal of Messrs. Harrinian and Kahn to make reply to questions put by the commission in the course of an inquiry concerning the dealings of Mr. Harrinian as president of tho Union Pacific railway in the stocks of other railraods, many of which are competing lines, in the course of his opinion Justice Holmes said that the commission's inquiries should be con fined to cases in which complaint had been made. He said the privacy should be properly regarded in pro ceedings begun by the commission for its own purposes. He also said that the powers conferred in the inter state commerce law exceed any which have ever been delegated by a consti tutional body of lawmakers. In a dissenting opinion, which was concurred in by Justices Harlan and McKenna, Justice Day declared that the effect of the opinion of the ma jority of the court would be to mate rially narrow the scope of the inter state commerce law. These three jus tices tool the position that the ques tions of the commission, so far as they were sustained by the United States circuit court for the Southern district of New York, were entirely proper under the law and should have been answered by Harriman and Kahn. Justice Harlan went even far ther and held that all of tho commis sion's questions should have received responses. Justice Moody did not par ticipate in the case.

Foreign Minister Paul replied on behalf of the acting president. He exhorted the people to trust Gomez to solve the difficult problems con fronting Venezuela.
