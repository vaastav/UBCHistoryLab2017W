L.AURENS S. C. Dec. 10, 1895. The Message* ~ "TPho ponderous paper of the day is the Messcgo of the President delivered to Congress on Tuesday last. Tho speeches of Qovornor Tlllman and Gov ernor Evans and other like light litera ture of the period, are evanescent, feathery and gossamer in comparison. These pass, as of tho day, as the ldlo wind, and are regard od not. But tho message deals with weighty matters. The foreign relations of the govern ment are complex and mixed, but are satisfactory. The President exhausts his powers of statement and argument in disoussing tho llnanoial condition of the country. As a statement, it is proba bly the clearest that has boon given, or can be, of the financial condition of the country; as an argumont sustaining the policy of his administration under monstrous legislation and failure to legislate, It is unansw 'able. He recognizes, and presents with power, our Indisputable flnanoial plight, but blazes a way out if the country should be wise enough to take his suggestion. This will not be done. Tho Republi cans being in power, will never adopt the views of a Domoorat; the Demo crats, if they were in power, would di vide, because they prefer riot, on fu sion and disordor. Southern demo cratic leaders want a sound currency probably, but they want office worse, and they will contlnuo to bofuddle, deceive and hold out false hopos to the people. Abuse of Cleveland they think oheanor^and more promising toUJiuomfaajsM IfcSworing his argu ijW be a contlnuod ihe domoorats do orifcy of tho Senator Tlllman objects that greon baoks should be issued by tho Govern ment instead of bonds. This is equiv alent to putting tho country on a silver basis. It is truo the greenbacks would not bear interest But the Gov ernment issues the greonbaoks, the bolder presents them for payment, and there is nothing to pay with. If silver is handy and Is tendered in redemp tion, It is equivalent to saying?I pay you in coin of a dollar denomination worth In the world's market only fifty cents. Six millions of our nine millions bales of cotton aro sold to England and our farmers now get gold or its equiv alent. They will not accept money worth fifty per cent, of Its faco value. Every cotton producer will Insist on sound money. * The latest iiqwo from Wfcirtdaaiftn senator Irby has not ap peared in his seat and was in the care of a physician. Ben Tlllman had at tended a silver caucus, where the com pany were eight. He immediately at tended a caucus of Democrats. That Benjamin of ours gets around lively and don't you forgot lt? So does Samps Pope. For four years clorkof Tlllman's State Senate at $1200 a year, then inde pendent candidate for Governor, and now trimming hia sails to lead the Re ? publicans in this State Benjamin no doubt rogrets the training ho gave to the wily Sampeon. Believo in every man's honesty, but keep your hand on your pocket book. A negro man and an old colored wo man, his mother, wore murdered by four white men in Colleton county dur ing last week. The man was charged with a petty theft and the woman with concealing it. If the details of the butohery are as reported tho butohors will soon swing according to law, if there be decency, Christianity or civil ization in that region. We trust that the good name of the Stato will be vin dicated?-Colleton being a part of South Carolina. iWe are refreshed and rojoicod to seo ^bbevllle Press and Banner consented to annouce itself out, thick and thin Tillman lut?medlumlng the Abbeville The only objection wo have tho Press and Banner was [nt claim to bo conservative jatlves had a good deal to r, and tho protended alle Press and Banner was a [dition to their weight of illy News, supper. The cons*rvativo press in tho Stato approve th<v work of the convention.? All agree t^at there is too much work Of legislation. As a rulo tho delegates were guided by patriotic impulses.? Partisan z<jal and partisan passion hero and there tropt out. But this was ex ceptional, and tho broa?VfepIrit govern ing the great majority of tho body pre vented much hurtful legislation. The convention closed its delibora. tlons in a love-foast and all parties and shades of opinion and all colors were In good humor. All unitod in a testi monial of good will to President Ev ans. A bandsomo gold watch was given him?this was in good taste?it should not havo been of any baser metal. Tt fs c'aar that there is no long er Any factional Issuos to divide the White people. Factional linos aro gone. In 1896 we shall have olootion year. The issues will be'"purely financial. Thero should be no quarreling in this State. However tho htate goes?as goes the National Democracy in Na> tlonal convention?when tho party has spoken?she and all her people owing illeg!--"- Democracy should { Gov Evans has respited Wash Owens, (who was to have been hanged last Friday,) until the 2d Friday in Febuary next. Ho was convicted of murder nearly twelve months ago.? Some centuries back by tho mouth of tho Lord Hamlet, something was said of the ills that flesh la heir to and among them pr mlnontly catalogued?"the '?law's dolay." Tho convention adjourned hink dik at 22 & 4 mlnutca past 4 o'clock P. M on Wednesday last having adopted tho instrument as a whole by a vote of 110 to 7. Originally tho body consisted of 100; three had died sinco its organiza tion and so there were thirty-four not voting. ? *? As will be soonelsowherothe Clinton Cotton Mill enterprise is a fixture- Tho project is taking shape and there's nothing to do now but move forward and build tho factory. Tako oaro, Lau rons, Clinton is coming.?Clinton Ga zette. Precisely as we expected and as the Advekti8EK prophesied. Aud tho Ad vertisek rojolcos with great joy. And in a little while Cross Hill, Mountvlllo, Gray Court, Waterloo, High Point, Lanfords, Ora, Thomas and Maddon will follow on tho heels of Clinton. A. J. McElrath. killed a wild goose In tho river near town yostorday It weighed 18 pounds and measured seven feet from tip to tip,?Piedmont corres pondence State. Tho constitutional convention declin ing to adopt the fomale sulTrage clauso did a bit of execution in this line. Tho Atlanta Journal hammers Senator Tlllman and Gov. Evans for their speechos at Atlanta. All right. Giants can stand battering rams. When you have 15,000 to hurrah for you and 1,500 molish at your back, you will pay small attention to tho paper bullets of a newspaper. * * * If the government stamps a piece of silver as big as a ton cent pleco as a dollar and it is redoemablo In a gold dollar wortn one hundred cents thon a dime may bo made to pass for a dollar. But do you bollovo it and aro you will ing to so accept It? If the stamp of tho government can add fifty cents to the value of a piece of silver, thon free colnago is right and the mints should run day and night and their capacity bo many times multi plied. *? * Factional lines gone as to the white people In this Stato, surely the peoplo will not fall out on tho question of the ofllcos and who shall hold thorn. Mor it alone?fltnoss?character and abil ity should decide. The President does not care partic ularly about what kinds of money wo have as currency but ho is concorned that tho people handle such money as may bo redeemed at sight in coin equal in actual value to tho nominal value of tho currency. Congressmen Strait and Latimer aro no longer to be black listed by the Postmaster General and will be allowed to control the appointments In their DistriotJ?. Tlllman lo In Washington. Clovoland had better look out. Nobody with good horso sense ob jects to silver as part of tho currency of tho country. But every man of horse sonso wants a dollar which is worth as much as any othor dollar. With the intrinsic valuo of an Amori lean silver dollar at fifty cents the gold dollar worth intrinsically ono hundred cents is the only standard of value. The Columbia Register significantly suggests that Senator Tlllman will bo judicious in tho use of his pitchfork at Washington. But what was ho sent there for? Senators Tillman and Irby occupy seats widely separated In the Senate Chamber. That Tired Feeling So common at this season, is a serious condition, liable to lead to disastrous results. It is a sure sign of declining health tone, and that the blood is im poverished and impure. The best and most successful remedy is found in
