ALFONSO OBEYS HIS QUEEN LIKE A SLAVE Vlinds as Naughty Boy Does Mother, to Amusement of British Court. MAKES EDWARD LAUGH 'Put on Your Coat," Ens Command** and the King Does, in a: :,: Hurry, as Wife Ap proaches. London, Special: King Alfonso is still tils young wife's devoted slave. She leads him where she will by a silken thread, which, however, sometimes be comes visible to her royal relations. He obeys her orders as a good hus band should. So, being certain of him, his spouse, with a self-confidence -which most, royal wives lack, insists that he Khali not be tied to her apron strings, but shall go where he pleases with his intimates and enjoy his sports. Yet Queen Victoria knows how to assert herself and how to restrain Tier husband's boyish impulsiveness. A proof of this vastly amused King Ed ward at Sandringham during the re cent visit, of the Spanish royal couple there. The Spanish king is a fine sporting shot, but the prince of Wales, the sec ond best shot in England, was bringing down more birds than Alfonso, never missing one. Alfonso decided that his shooting coat hampered his aim, and. throwing' off the coat, flung it from "him. Then, while King Edward, laugh ingly spurred the rivalry. King Alfonso shot so fast and accurately that soon he had as many birds as the prince of Wales. "Alfonso, Put Your Coat On." Alfonso was as happy us a boy with a new gun. Hut. unfortunately for him, IiIr wife, with Queen Alexandra and Cjueen Mauri of Norway, was in a motor cur, watching the battle from a little distance. Seeing her husband without a coat, Queen Victoria sent a peremp tory message by one of her suite, bid ding him to put on his coat, lest he catch cold. The courtier put the order into many polite words and delivered it most hesitatingly, but the king paid no attention to it. He went on shoot ing, bringing down birds with unerring aim. His wife alighted from the motor and approached her disobedient spouse, who, Intent on the birds, did not see her. Hut King Edward did, and, al though laughing heartily, called to Ai fon.so: "You had best be careful, your wife is coming." Allonso glanced around, saw the queen approaching him, thrust his gun into a bearer's hands, took his coat from another, and, while the whole party, men and women, shrieked with laughter, hastily put on his coat. In a word, however gentle the queen's control over him, it could not be more complete If she were ten years Alfonso's senior. Late for the Train.: Hut: she has not yet eradicated his Spanish habit of procrastinating, of saying "Manana," nor his Spanish In difference to keeping an engagement punctually. The whole royal party gain left London for Sandringham. King Alfonso was twenty minutes lato for the special train. His wife was furious, for punctuality is almost a re ligion with the English royal family, in alt probability Alfonso would havo been even later for the train had he not expected that the guns would start: at Sandringham three hours earlier than they did. But it is entire ly likely that his queen will break Al fonso of his dilatorlness. An English friend asked her the oth er day if she and her husband were not exposed to great danger from an archists In Spain. "Enu" laughed as the said: "We run far greater danger of break ing our necks while making up time In a motor on an engagement for which we. ure late than from anything the anarchist can do to us." Everyone here Is raving about the beauty of Queen "Ena," as she is still called affectionately, and she aroused equal admiration in Paris. Her blond complexion Is unsurpassable In Its per fection of pink and white her blue gray eyes with the dark lashes are wonderfully attractive. At first her figure was the despair of the Parisian modistes, for she has a short neck und a high waist. But the ingenious dressmakers have succeeded in making h(-r appear both slender and grace ful. The queen dresses with tasteful iragnlficence. When her mother. Prin cess Henry, of Battenburg, entertained King Edward at Kensington palace the other night, the Spanish queen, wear ing a beautiful white gown, a superb diamond crown nnd diamond and ruby ornaments, looked dazzling. She has acquired the "queenly manner" and. indeed, can hold her own In any as semblage of Knglish women, even of the most beautiful. Pointed Paragraphs. From the Chicago News. Wise men cultivate the art of tak ing things easy. Pew men bewail the loss of an other man's money. Every time a girl falls in love she wonders if it will take. Moat commonly a woman argues the same way ahe gets off a car. It sometimes happens that a fresh »uy is mistaken for a man of nerve. When a man gets religion he has to go to work and build up a new rep utation. A girl will never believe a man who tells her he loves her and lets It go at that. Many a silent, man gets credit for being wise because he can't think of anything to say. Sometimes a woman has a good time because she isn't having a good time. It is folly for a man to marry a woman who is a good cook, unless he is willing to supply the raw ma terial. Wasn't It Strange? From I.lppincotc's. A New York publisher tells of an Indiana man who came to the big city for the purpose of placing a novel of his writing. He seemed at first very enthusiastic over the prospect- espe cially as so many of his friends at home bad succeeded in finding a market in New York for their stories. Then began the wearisome round of the publishers' Offices, with the novice's usual luck. One day. Just before his departure for the Hoosler state he met an acquaintance who knew of his ambi tion. and who asked what luck he had encountered. "The worst possible." exclaimed the Indiana'man. "I'm the only Hoosler in New York tWt can't get a poor story published." ROOSEVELT STANDS if FOR REGULATION OF BI6 CORPORATIONS In Message Delivered Tuesday He Urges a National In corporation Act. MONEY REFORM IS NEEDED Ke Leaves It to Congress to Select Plan, but Inclines Toward Guar anty Fund for Protection-— Many Points Covered. Washington. D. C„ Dec. S.—Pres ident Roosevelt today sent his annual message to the sixtieth congress, and it was read in both branches of the assembly. In part the message is as follows: The Senate and House of Represent atives: No nation has greater re sources than ours, and I think it can be truthfully said that the citizens of no nation possess greater energy and industrial ability. In no nation are the fundamental business conditlonssound er than in ours at this very moment and it is foolish, when such is the case, for people to hoard money instead of keeping it in sound banks for it is such hoarding that is the Immediate occasion of money stringency. More over, as a rule, the business of our peo ple is conducted with honesty and pro bity, and this applies alike to farms and factories, to railroads and banks, to all our legitimate commercial enter prises. In any largo body of men. however, there are certain to be some who arc dishonest. and if the conditions are such that these men prosper or com mit their misdeeds with impunity, their example is a very evil thing for the community. Where these men ara business men of great fiagaclty and of temperament both unscrupulous and reckless, and where the conditions are such that they act without supervision ur control and at first without effective check from public opinion, they delude many innocent people into making in vestments or embarking in kinds of business that are really unsound. When the misdeeds of these successfully dis honest men are discovered, suffering comes not only upon them, but upon the innocent men whom they have misled. It is a painful awakening, whenever it oc curs and, naturally, when it does oc cur those who suffer are apt to forget that the longer it was deferred the more painful it would be. In the effort to punish the guilty it is both, wise and proper to endeavor so far as possible to minimize the distress of those who have been misled by the guilty. Yet it is not possible to refrain because of such distress from striving to put an end to the misdeeds that are the ulti mate causes of the sufferings, and, as a means to this end, where possible to punish those responsible for them. There may be honest differences of opinion as to many governmental poli cies but surely there can bo no such differences as to the need of unflinch ing perseverence in the war against successful dishonesty. (Here the president quotes from his 1905 message his declaration for the square deal between corporations and people and for the regulations of inter state commerce to this end.) I have called your attention in these quotations to what I have already said because I am satisfied that it is the duty of the national government to em body in action the principles thus ex pressed. Interstate Commerce. No small part of the trouble that we have comes from carrying to an ex treme the national virtue of self-re liance, of independence in initiative and action. It is wise to conserve this vir tue and to provide for its fullest exer cise. compatible with seeing that lib erty does not become a liberty to wrong others. Unfortunately, this is the kind of liberty that the lack of all effective regulation Inevitably breeds. The founders of the constitution pro vided that the national government should have complete and sole control of interstate commerce. There was then practically 110 interstate business save such as was conducted by water, and this the national government at once proceeded to regulate in thor oughgoing and effective fashion. Con ditions have now so wholly changed that the interstate commerce by water is insignificant compared with the amount that goes by land, and almost ail big business concerns are now en gaged in interstate commerce. As a result, it can be but partially and Im perfectly controlled or regulated by the action of any one of the several states such action inevitably tending to be either too drastic or else too lax. and in either case ineffective for purposes of justice. Only the national government can in thoroughgoing fashion exercise the needed control. This does not mean that there should be any exten sion of federal authority, for such authority already exists un der the constitution in amp lest and most far-reaching form but it does mean that there should be an extension of federal activity. This is not advocating centralization. It is merely looking lacts in the face, and realizing that centralization in busi ness hojs already come and cannot be avoided or undone, and that the pub lic at large can only protect itself from certain evil effects of this business centralization by providing better methods for the-exercise of control through the authority already central ized in the national government by the constitution itself. There must be no halt In the healthy constructive course of ac Hon which this nation has elected to pursue, and has steadily pur sued, during the last six years, as shown both in the legislation of the congress and the admlnistra tion of the law by the department of justice. The most vital need Is in connection with the railroads. As to these, in my judgment there should now be either a national in corporation act or a law licensing railway companies to engage in in terstate commerce upon certain con dltions. THE LAW 

SHOULD BE SO FRAMED AS TO GIVE TO THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION POWER TO PASS UPON THE FUTURE ISSUE OF SECURITIES, WHILE AMPLE MEANS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO ENABLE THE COMMISSION, WHENEVER IN ITS JUDGMENT IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE A PHYSICAL VALUATION OF ANY RAILROAD. Should Permit Pooling. As I stated in my message to the congress a year ago. railroads should be given power to enter into -.agree ments. subject to these agreements be ing made public Jr. minute detail and to the consent of the Interstate Com merce commission being first obtained. Until the national government as sumes proper control of interstate com merce, in the exercise of the authority it already possesses, it will be Impos sible either to give to or to get from the railroads full justice. Sherman Anti-Trust Law. Moreover, in my judgment there should be additional legislation look ing to the proper control of the great business concerns engaged in inter state business, this control to be ex ercised for their own benefit and pros perity no less than for the protection of investors and of the general public. As I have repeatedly saivt in messages to the congress and elsewhere, experi ence has definitely Bhown not merely the unwisdom but the futility of en deavoring to put a stop to all busi ness combinations. Modern industrial conditions are such that combination is not only necessary but inevitable. It is so In the world of business just as it is in the world of labor, and it is idle to desire to put an end to all corporations, to all big combinations of capital, as to desire to put an end to the combinations of labor. Corporation and labor union alike have come to stay. Each, if properly managed is a source of good and not evil. Whenever in either there is evil, it shojld be promptly held to account but it should receive hearty encouragement so long as it is properly managed. It is pro foundly immoral to put or keep on the statute books a law, nominally in the interest of public morality, that really puts a premium upon public immoral ity, by undertaking to forbid honest men from doing what must be done un der modern business conditions, so that the law itself provides that its own In fraction must be the condition prece dent upon business success. To aim at the accomplishment of too much i«sual ly means the accomplishment of too little, and often the doing of positive damage. Forbid the Evil Combination. (Here the president cited previous ex pressions to the effect that the Sher man anti-trust act is so framed that the business of the country cannot be conduct without breaking it.) The antil-trust law should not be repealed but it should be made both more efficient and more in harmony with actual conditions. It should be emended so as to forbid only the kind of combin ation which does harm to the gen eral public, such amendment to be accompanied by, or to be an incident ot, a grant of supervisory power to the government over these big concerns engaged in in terstate business. This should be accompanied by provision for the compulsory publication 02 accounts and the subjection of books and papers to the inspection of the government officials. A beginning has already been made for such supervision by the establishment of the bureau of corporations. The anti-trust lav.' should not pro hibit combinations that do 110 injustice to the public, still less those the ex istence of which is on the whole of benefit ',o the public. But even if this feature of the law were abolished, there would remain as an equally ob jectionable feature the difficulty and deiay now incident to its enforcement. The government must now submit to irksome and repeated delay before ob taining a final decision of the courts upon proceedings instituted, and even a favorable decree may mean an empty victory. Moreover, to attempt to con trol these corporations by law suits means to impose upon both the depart ment of justice and the courts an im possible burden it is not feasible to carry on more than a limited number of such suits. Such a law to be really effective must of course be admin istered by an executive body, and not merely by means of law suits. The de sign should be to prevent the abuses incident to the creation of unhealthy and improper combinations, instead of waiting until they are in existence and then attempting to destroy them by civil or criminal proceedings. Condemns Trusts in Necessities. A combination should not be tol erated if it abuse the power ac quired by combination to the pub lie detriment. No corporation or association of any kind should be permitted to engage in foreign or interstate commerce that is formed for the purpose of, or whose op erations create, a monopoly or gen eral control of the production, sale, or distribution of any one or more of the prime necessities of life or articles of general use and neces sity. Such combinations are against public policy they violate the commcn law the doors of the courts are closed to those who are parties to them, and I believe the congress can close the channels of interstate commerce against them for its protection. The law should make its prohibitions and permis sions as clear and definite as pos sible. leaving the least possible room for arbitrary action, or al legation of such action, on the part of the executive or of divergent Interpretations by the courts. Among the points to be aimed at should be the prohibition of un healthy competition such as by rendering service at an actual loss for the purpose of crushing out competition, the prevention of in fiation of capital, and the prohi hition of a corporation's making exclusive trade with itself a con dition of having any trade with itself. Reasonable agreements be tween, or combinations of corpora tions should be permitted, provided they are fiwt submitted to and ap proved by some appropriate gov ernment body. THE 

CONGRESS HAS THE POW ER TO CHARTER CORPORATIONS TO ENGAGE IN INTERSTATE AND FOREIGN COMMERCE, AND A GEN ERAL LAW CAN BE ENACTED UN DER THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH EXISTING CORPORATIONS COULD TAKE OUT FEDERAL CHARTERS AND NEW FEDERAL CORPORA TIONS COULD 1JE CREATED. License as an Alternative. An essential provision of such a law should be a method of predetermining by some federal board or commission whether the applicant for a federal charter was an association or combi nation within the restrictions of the federal law. Provision should also be made for complete publicity in all mat ters affecting the public and complete protection to the investing public and the shareholders in the matter of issu ing corporate securities. If an incor poration law is not deemed advisable, a license act for big interstate corpor ations might be enacted or a combi nation of the two might be tried. The supervision established might be an alogous to that now exercised over na tional banks. At least, the anti-trust act should be supplemented by specific prohibitions of the methods which ex perience has shown have been of most service in enabling monopolistic com binations to crush out competition. Tiie real owners of a corporation should be compelled to do business In their own name. The right to hold stock in other corporations should hereafter be de nied to interstate corporations unless on approval by the proper government officials, and a prerequisite to such ap proval should be the listing with the government of all owners and stock holders, both by the corporation own ing such stock and by the corporation in which such stock is owned. To confer upon the national gov ernment, in connection with the amend ment I advocate in the anti- trust law. Power of supervision over big business concerns engaged in interstate com merce, would benefit them as It has benefited the national banks, in the recent business crisis it is noteworthy that the institutions which failed were institutions which were not under the supervision tind control of the national government. Those which were under national control stood the test. Would Help the Railroads. National control of the kind above advocated would be to the benefit of every well managed railway. From the standpoint of the public there is need for additional tracks, additional terminals, and improvements in the actual handling of the railroads, and all this as rapidly as possible. Ample, safe and speedy transportation facili ties are even more necessary than cheap transportation. Therefore, there is need for the Investment of money which will provide for all these things while at the same time securing as far as is possible better wages and shorter hours for their employes. Therefore, while there must be just and reason able regulation of rates, we should be the first to protest against any arbi trary and unthinking movement to cut them down without the fullest and most careful consideration of all in terests concerned and of the actual needs of the situation. Only a spe cial body of men acting for the na tional government under authority con ferred upon it by the congress is com petent to pass Judgment on such a matter. Pure Food Lav/ a Success. Those who fear, from any rea son, the extension of federal ac tlvity will do well to study the history not only of the national banking act but of the pure food law, and notably the meat inspec tion law recently enacted. The pure food law was opposed so vlo lently that its passage was de layed for a decade yet it has worker unmixed and Immediate good. The meat inspection law was even more violently assailed and the same men who now de nounce the attitude of the aa tional government in seeking to oversee and control the workings of interstate common carriers and business concerns, then asserted that wo were "discrediting and ruining a great American indus try." Two years have not elapsed, and already it has become evident that the great benefit the law con fers upon the public is accom plished by an equal benefit to the reputable packing establishments. The latter are better off under the law than they were without it. The benefit to interstate common car riers and business concerns from the legislation 1 advocate would be equally marked. Currency Reform Needed. In my message to the congress a year ago I spoke as follows of the currency: "1 especially call your attention to the condition of our currency laws. The national bank act has ably served a great purpose in aiding the enormous business development of the country, and within ten years there has been an increase in circulation per capita from $21.41 to $33.08. For several years evi dence has been accumulating that ad ditional legislation is needed. The re currence of each crop season empha sizes the defects of the present laws. There must soon be a revision of them because to leave them as they are means to incur liability of business dis aster. Since your body adjourned there has been a fluctuation In the in terest on call money from 2 per cent, to 30 per cent, and the fluctuation was even greater during the preceding six months. The secretary of the treasury had to step in and by wise action put a stop to the most violent period of oscillation. Even worse than such fluctuation is the advance in commer cial rates and the uncertainty felt in the Insufficiency of credit even at high rates. All commercial interests suffer during each crop period. Excessive rates for call money in New York at tract money from the interior banks into the speculative field. This depletes the fund that would otherwise be avail able for commercial uses, and commer cial borrowers are forced to pay ab normal rates, so that each fall a tax, in the shape of increased interest charges, is placed on the whole com merce of the country. "The mere statement of these facts shows that our present system Is se riously defective. There is need of a change. It must never be forgotten that this question concerns business men generally quite as much as bank ers esnecially Is this true of stock men, farmers, and business me in the wist for at present at certain seasons of the year the difference in interest rates between the east and west is from 6 to 10 per cent,, whereas in'Can ada the corresponding different is but 1! per cent." I again urge on the congress the need of immediate attention to this matter. We need a greater elasticity in our cur rency: provided, of course, that we recognize the even greater need of a safe and secure currency. There must always be the most rigid examination by the national authorities. Should Be Elastic System. Provision should be made for an emergency currency. The emer gency issue should, of course, be made with effective guaranty, and upon conditions carefully prescribed by the government. Such emer gency Issue must be based on ade quate securities approved by the government, and must be issued un der a heavy tax. This would permit currency being issued when the de inand for it was urgent, while se curing its retirement as the demand fell off. it is worth investigating to determine whether officers and directors of national banks should ever be allowed to loan to them selves. Trust companies should be subject to the same supervision as banks legislation to this effect should be enacted for the District of Columbia and the territories. Yet we must also remember that even the wisest legislation on the subject can only accomplish a certain amount. No- legislation can by any possibllity guarantee the business community against the results of speculative folly any more than It can guarantee an individual against the results of his ex travagance. When an Individual mort gages his house to buy an automobile he invites disaster and when wealthy men, or men who pose as such, or are unscrupulously or foolishly eager to be come such, indulge in reckless specula tion—especially if it is accompt nled by dishonesty—they jeopardize not only their own future, but the *uture of all their innocent fellow citizens, for they expose the whole business community to panic and distress. The Tariff. This country is definitely com mitted to the protective system and and any effort to uproot It couid not but cause widespread industrial disaster. In ether words, the prin- clple of the present tariff law could not with wisdom be changed. But in a country of such phenom enal growth as ours it is probably well that every dozen years or so the tariff laws should be carefully scrutinized so as to see that no ex :cesslve or improper benefits are conferred thereby, that proper rev enue is provided, and that our for eign trade is encouraged. There must always be as a minimum a tariff which will not only allow for the collection of an ample revenue but which will at least make good the difference in cost of production here and abroad that is, the dlf ference In the labor cost here and abroad, for the well being of the wage-worker must ever be a card lnal point of American policy. The quefUon should be aproached pure ly from a business, standpoint: both the time and the manner of the change being such as to arouse the minimum of agitation and dls turbance in the business world, and to give the least play for selfish and factional motives. The solo consideration should be to sen that the sum total of changes repre sents the public good. This means that the subject can not with wis-: dom be dealt with in the year pre ceding a presidential election, be cause as a matter of fact experl ence has conclusively shown that at such a time it is impossible to get men to treat it from the stand point of the public good. In my judgment the wise time to deal with the matter is immediately af ter such election. Income Tax and Inheritance Tax. When our tax laws are revised the question of an income tax and an in heritance tax should receive the careful attention of our legislators. Iii my Judgment both of these taxes should be part of our system of federal taxa tion. I speak diffidently about the in come tax because one scheme for an income tax was declared unconstitu tional by the supreme court while In addition It Is a difficult tax to adminis ter In its practical working, and great care would have to be exercised to see that It was not evaded by the very men whom it v-ns most desirable to havo taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than 110 tax at all as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the hon est 11s compared with the dishonest man. Nevertheless, a graduated in come tax of the proper type would be 1**. desirable feature of federal taxation, and it is to be hoped that one may be devised which the supreme court will declare constitutional. The inheritance ta*. however, is both a far better method cf taxation, and fa.y more im portant for the purpose of having the fortunes of the county boar In propor tion to their Increase in size a corre sponding Increase and burden of tax ation. The government has the absolute right to deoide as to the terms upon which a man shall receive a be quest or devise from another, and this point in the devolution of prop erty is especially appropriate for the Imposition of a tax. Laws im posing such taxes have repeatedly been placed upon the national statute books and as repeatedly de clared constitutional by the courts and these laws contained the pro gresslve principle, that is, after a certain amount is reached the be quest or gift, in life or death, is increasingly burdened and the rate of taxation is increased in propor tion to the remoteness of blood of the man receiving the bequest. Behind the European Countries. The principles are recognized already In the leading civilized nations of the world. In Great Britain all the es tates worth $5,000 or less are practically exempt from death duties, while the increase is such that when an estate exceeds $5,000,000 In value and pusses to a distant kinsman or stranger in blood the government receives all told an amount equivalent to nearly a fifth of the whole estate. In France so much of an inheritance as exc.eed.s $10,000,000 pays over a fifth to the state if it passes to a distant relative. The German law is especially Interest ing to us because It makes the In heritance tax an Imperial measure while allotting to the Individual .states of the empire a portion of the proceeds and permitting them to impose taxes In addition to those imposed by the im perial government. Small Inheritances are exempt, but the tax is so sharply progressive that when the Inheritance is still not very large, provided it is not an agricultural or a forest land. It Ls taxed at the rate of 25 per cent. If It goes to distant relatives. There is no reason why in the United States the national government should not Impose inheritance taxes in addition to those Imposed by the stales, and when we last had an inheritance tax about one-half of the states levied such taxes concurrently with the national govern ment, making a combined maximum rate, in some cases as high as 25 per cent. The tax should Is possible be made to bear more heavily upon those residing without the country than within it. A heavy progressive tax upon a very large fortune ls In no way such a tax upon thrift or industry as alike tax would bo on a small for tune. No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the indi viduals inheriting the money by per mitting the transmission in their en tirety of the enormous fortunes which would be affected by such a tax qjid as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help to pre serve a measurable equality of oppor tunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood. Enforcement of the Law. A few years ago there was loud com plaint that the law could not bo in voked against wealthy offenders. There is no such complaint now. The course of the department of Justice during the last few years has been such as to make it evident that no man stands above the law, that no corporation is so wealthy that It cannot be held to account. But the laws them selves need strengthening in more than one important point, they should be made more definite, so that no hon est man can be led unwittingly to break them, and so that the real wrongdoer can be readily punished. Moreover, there must be the pub lie opinion back of the laws or the laws themselves will be of no avail. At present, while the av erage juryman undoubtedly wishes to see trusts broken up, and is quite ready to fine the corpora tion Itself, he is very reluctant to find the facts proven beyond a rea sonable doubt when it comes to sending to Jail a member of the business community for indulging in practices which are profoundly unhealthy, but which, unfortunate ly, the business community has grown to recognize as well night normal. Both the present condl tion of the law and the present temper of juries render it a task of extreme difficulty to 'get at the real wrongdoer in any such case, especially by Imprisonment. Yet it Is from every standpoint far preferable to punish the prime of fender by imprisonment rather than to fine the corporation, with the attendant damage to stock holders. Accidents. The loss of life and limb from rait road accidents in this country has be come appalling. It is a subject of which the national government should take supervision. It might be welt to begin by providing for a federal in spector of interstate railroads some where along the lines of federal inspec tion of steamboats, although not going so far perhaps at first all that It would be necessary to have would be some officers whose duty it would be to Investigate all acidents on interstate railroads and report In detail the cavises thereof. Employers' Liability. Congress should adopt legislation pro viding limited but definite compensa tion for accidents to all workmen with in the scope of the federal power, in cluding employes of navy yards and arsenals. In other words, a model em ployers' liability act, far reaching and thoroughgoing, should be enacted which should apply to all positions, public and private, over, which the na tional government has jurisdiction. The law should be made such that the payment for accidents by the em ployer would be automatic Instead of being a matter for lawsuits. Workmen should receive certain and definite com pensation for all accidents In Industry irrespective of negligence. By the proposed law, employers would gain a desirable certainty of ob ligation and get rid of litigation to determine It, while the workman and his family would be relieved from a crushing load. The constitutionality of the employ ers' liability act passed by the preced ing congress has been carried before the courts. In the event that the court should affirm the constitutional ity of the act, I urge further legislation along the lines advocated in my fnes sage to the preceding congress. Since 1S95 practically every country of Eu rope. together with Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, British Columbia, and the Cape of Good Hope has enacted legislation embodying in one form or another the complete recognition of the prlnclnle which places upon the em-, ployer the entire trade risk In the various lines of Industry. Eight-Hour Law. The principle of the eight-hour day should as rapidly and as far as prac ticable be extended to the entire work carried on by the government and the present law should be amended to embrace contracts on those public, works which the present wording of the act lias been construed to exclude. Investigation of Industrial Disputes. •, Strikes and lockouts, with their at tendant loss and suffering, continue to increase. For the five years ending December 31, 1905, the number of strikes was greater than those In any previous ten years and was double the number in the preceding five years. These fig ures Indicate the increasing need of providing some machinery to deal wltl. this class of disturbances in the inter est alike of the employer, the employe, and the general public. I renew my previous recommendation that the con-. gross favorably consider the matter of creating the machinery for compulsory investigation of such industrial contro versies as are of sufficient magnitude, and of sufficient concern to the people qf the country as a whole to warrant the federal government in taking ac tion. Employment of Women and Children A thorough and comprehensive meas ure should be adopted at this session of the congress relating to the employ ment of women and children in the District of Columbia and the terrl-, lories. The investigation into tlu* condition of women and children wage-earners recently authorized and directed by the congress is now being carried on In the various states, and I recommend that the appropriation made last year for the beginning of thi't work be renewed, In order that we maj have the thorough and comprehensi\ Investigation which the subject de mands. The national government has' as an ultimate resort for control of child labor the use of the interstate commerce clause to prevent the prod ucts of child labor from entering into, interstate commerce. But before using this it ought certatnly to enact model laws on the subject for the territories under its own immediate control. The Really Dangerous Criminals. Vice in Its cruder and more archaic forms shocks everybody but. there is very urgent need that publi opinion .should be just as severe in con demnation of the vice which hides itself behind class or professional loyalty, 0:1 which denies that it ls vice If it cai. escape conviction in the courts. 1 Swindling In stocks, corrupting legislatures, making fortunes by the Inflation of securities, by wreck lng railroads, by destroying coin petitors through rebates—these forms of wrongdoing in the cap italist, are for more infamous than any ordinary form of embezzlement or forgery yet it is a matter of ex treine difficulty to stcure the pun lshment of the man most guilty of them, most responsible for' them. The business man who oondones such conduct stands on a level with the labor man who deliberately sup ports a corrupt demagogue and agl tator, whether head of a union or head of some municipality, because he is said to have "stood by the union." The members of the busl ness community, the educators, or clergymen, who condone and en courage the first kind of wrongdo ing, are no more dangerous to the community, but are morally even worse, than the labor men who are guilty of the second type of wrong doing, because less is to be pai doned those who have no such ex cuse as ls furnished either by ignor- ." ance or by dire need. Farmers and Wage Workers.
