MEETS ISSUES WITH VIGOR f Proposes Keeping Peace in Central America, Despite Insinuations , Economy in Appropriations, With Surplus in View for 1010. Associated Press-.. .- The first message of President Taft to the sixty-first congress was delivered today. It contains over 16,000 words, and its reading oc cupied nearly an hour and a half. At 1:40 p. m. the reading was con cluded in the House and that body adjourned until Friday. Extracts from the message fol low: Foreign Relations. Referring to the fisheries dispute with Great Britain, which lias been submitted to the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague: "The American rights under the fisheries article of the Treaty of 18 to have been a cause of difference be tween the United States and Great Britain for nearly seventy years. The interests involved are of great im portance to the American fishing in dustry, and the final settlement of the controversy will remove a source of constant irritation and complaint. This is the first case involving such great international questions which has been submitted to the Perman ent Court of Arbitration at The Hague. "Commissioners have been ap. pointed on the part of the United States to act jointly with Commis sioners on the part of Canada in examining into the question of ob structions in the St. John River be tween Maine and New Brunswick, and to make recommendations for the regulation of the uses thereof, and are now enaged in this work." The question of extending aid to the negro republic of Liberia, which is represented to bn in a critical po sition, and to which a commission was sent to ascertain true conditions: "It will be remembered that the interest of th United States in the Republic of Liberia springs from the historical-fact of the foundation of lire Republic Tjy'T.he coIonizahoil--9?-J American citizens-of the African race. In an early treaty with Libe ria ithere is a provision under which the United States may be called up on for advice or assistance. Pur suant to this porvision and in the spirit of the moral relationship of the United States to Liberia, that Republic last year asked this Gov ernment to lend assistance in the so. lution of certain of their national problems, and hence the Commission was sent. "The report of our commissioners has just been completed and is now under examination by the Depart ment of State. It is hoped that there may result some helpful measures, in which case it may be my duty again to invite your attention to this subject." Of the Foutrh Pan-American Con ference: "Un tne atn oi Juiy next, mere will open at Buenos Aires the Foutrh Pan-American Conference. This con ference will have a special meaning to the hearts of all Americans, be cause around its date are culstered the anniversaries of th, independ ence of so many of the American re publics. It is not. necesary for me to remind the Congress of the polit ical, social and commercial import, ance of these gatherings. You are asked to make liberal appropriation for our participation. If this be granted, it is my purpose to appoint a distinguished and representative delegation, qualified fittingly to rep resent this country and to deal witn the problems of intercontinental in terest which will there be discus sed." Touching upon relations with oth er American republics: "The Pan-American policy of this government has long been fixed in its principles anil remains un changed. With the changed circum stances of the United States and of the Republics to the south of us, most of which have great natural resources, stable government and progressive ideals, the apprehension which gave rise to the Monroe Dec- trine may be said to have nearly dis appeared, and neither the doctrine ecs it exists nor any other doctrine of American policy snouui ue per. mittd. to operate for the perpetua- uon of irresponsible government, the escape of just obligations, or tne in s.uious ai.egation of dominating am bitions on the part of the United ti.ates. "uesides the fundamental doc trines of our Pan-American policy there have grown up a realization of political interests, community of int-.ui,ons and ideals, and a flour ishing commerce. All these bonds! will be greatly strengthened as timft goes cn and increased facilities, such as the great bank soon to be es tablished in Latin America, supply the rneans of uuuaing up the col lossal intercontinental commerce of the future."

"In crder to avoid a deficit for the ensuing fiscal year, I directed the heads of departments in the pre. paration of their estimates to make them as low as possiole consistent with imperative governmental ne fossitv The result has been, as I am advised" by the secretary of the treasury that the estimates for the expenses of the government for the noTt fiscal vear en'dins June 30, 1911, are less than the appropria tions for this current fiscal year by 542,818,000. So far as the secre tary of the treasury is able to form a judgment as to future income and to compare it with the expenditures for the next fiscal year ending July an. 1911. and excluding payments on account of the Panama canal which toIII rionhtless be taken ud by bonds. there will be a surplus of $35,931,- 000."
