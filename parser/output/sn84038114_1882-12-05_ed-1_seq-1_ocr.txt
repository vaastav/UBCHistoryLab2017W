I notice in the nr eion of the City Council, held on Thurs day evening last, that oar Bolons are still harping on the enforcement of the Sunday law in regard to persons carry ing on leguiar business on that day. In the oourswof a dlscuesion, provoked by a resolution offered by Mr. Garrett requesting the mayor to enforce the law, It was stated that oertain Photo graph galleries on Market street be tween Third and Fourth streets, and one on Third street between Market and King streets, were kept open on Sundays; and the regular basiuess tran sacted therein." How does the gentle man know this statement to be true ? Has he visited these places and had his photograph taken or does he make the avermont only on common rumor ? If he does not know it to be a fact from personal observation he has' no right to make the assertion, as he does gross injustice to the proprietors of these establishments, much less has hs the right in open session of tbo City Council to charge the Mayor with not performing his duty in the premises, as he has not a solntilla of evidenoe to prove the charge. It is astonishing what great advooates persons some times become of the preservation of the sanotlty of the Sabbath. For years they will constantly be engaged in some avocation in violation of the Sab bath laws and amass a large portion of their earthly riches on that day, bat when they can no longer get some poor workman for a mere pittance to work on Sunday, they suddenly become ex tremely shocked at the saorellginuiness of doing any secular work on the Sab bath and raise their hands iu holy hor ror at the bars idea that the authorities do pot enforce a law that neither the Mayor, the polioe or the members of the City Council have a particle of sub stantial evidenoe has been violated. Fora number of years that very same square the charge might have been made and proven by unquestionable evi denoe, uniil here of late. But why do the members of council coniine themselves to making attacks on photographers and venders ot cigars? If they are siuuerein their purposes, and really desire to stop all Sunday traffic, why not stop trains ot cars from run ning through our city ou Sunday, or steamboats from leaving our wharves ghtsd with people who really seek h means for mere pleasure, and nothing else. This is equally unlawful, hut it is iu the iuterest of a great mon ied corporation. And many of the men who reap pecuniary lienelits therefrom, are professed members of the Ohrintain Church. These railroads not only run trains every Sunday but every ouoe in a while put a large force of meu to work right In the very heart ot the olty, tearing up tracks and relaying them. But these gqntlemen say this is a work of ueoes •ity. Who would be injured if it were dose on a week day ? Why, say they, the travelling public would be Incom moded, aud this should not be. Ob, no I the wealthy must not be interfered with, but a poor man who deBlrei ts get his photograph taken ou Sunday, because he really cannot afford to lose the time required oua week day, on ao count of the low wages he receives, Is unworthy of all regard anil the aristo cracy who loaf three days out of the six, brow beat tiie Msyor because he does not enforce the Sunday law. We would advise these gentlemen to tie con sistent. If you are going to enforce the law do notoonUue yourselves to strik ing at the poor and small business men but let a portion of your maledic tions fall upon the huge monied corpo rations, aud then people will believe that you are actuated by honest mo tives aud not influenced by a disposi tion to do injury to a more successtul business rival. of the aes - to exile lor life.

Arabi was arraigned at 9 o'clock this morning iu the hall of the old Diara building, ltaouf Pasha, exGovernor of the Soudau, presided. Sir Charles Wilson watched the case ou behalf of Great Britain, but as no couusel was present for the Egyptian Government. Arabi oooupied a seat behind Mr. Brad lev aud Lord Napier aud was the only prisoner present. The president read the charges, and asked the prisoner whether he would'plead guilty. Arab' lmuded certain papers to Mr. Bradley, who thereupon arose aud stated that the accused had voluntarily and iu ao cordauce with the advice of his couusel pleaded guilty. There were few per sons present, and these were almost ex olusively Europeans. The proceedings occupied five minutes only. Ou the re assmfiling of the Court at 3 o clock in the atteruoou Raoui Pasha read the sentence, declaring that Arabi, having plead gailty, the Court had no alterna tive but to sentence him to death. The decree commuting the sentence says that Arabi will bo amenable to the sentence of death if he re-enters Egypt or its dependencies.

The Waterbury American has the following to say ou a too frequent change of pastoral relations: "Short pastorates destroy all the sacmluess which used to characteiiae that rela tion. How much nobler the spectacle of such a relation as t hat of Dr. Racou to Centre Church, New-Uaven, where after fifty years of Morvice he still oau tinnes pastor though no longer carry ing its burdens alone. In the case of one family,very likely in that of others he buried their dead from the venerable grandmother down to some of the youngest grandchildren, and officiated at the various christenings and marriages of two,generations,and when he died, his death meaut something more to the survivors than tbe decease of a favorite preacher or admired theologian. By a man who has occupied such a relation tor a working lifetime it can with truth be said: "The churoh It in I." He has largely made it what it is.'' George W. Walling, Hiq., Supt.

I PBKSIDENT ABtHDEV MCOID ANNUAL HIBIN AON—A COH SkHmiVI DOCUMENT. The following ie a condensation of President Arthur's seoond annual mes sage communicated and read at the opening of both Houses of Congress yesterday. In referring the rights of American citizens in Ireland, he says : "The arrest of citizens of the United States in Ireland under recent laws, which owe their origin to the disturb ed oonditiou of that country, has led to a somewhat extended correspondence with the Government of Great Britain. A disposition to respect onr -rights has been practically manifested by the re lease of the arrested parties " In protesting against the prosecution of the Jews in Russia, he regrets the persecution and says: "It has not transpired that any American citizen has heeu subjected to arrestor injury, but our courteous re monstrance has nevertheless been cour teously received. There is reason to believe that the time is not far distant when Russia will be able to Beonre tol eration to all faiths within her borders Referring to the Chlll-Peruvlau war ho oives a detailed statement of the condition of affairs in those countries and cougratulates himself that the United States spared no efforts to make peace, save snch as might involve im plications. He says: It is greatly to be deplored that Chili resolved to exact such rigorous condi tions of peace, and is indisposed to sub mit to arbitration the terms of cable settlement. No peaoe iB likely to be lasting that is not sufficiently equit able and just to command the approval of other nations. In speaking of a peaoe Cougresa he says. 1 trust that the time is nigh when, with the universal assent of civilized people, all international differences shall be determined without resort to arms by the benignant processes of ar bitration. l'he President congratulates the natlo i upon the general existiug peace with all the civilized nations, and re- commend legislation in harmony with other Powers to prevent collisions at sea ; and that a conference be held to determine upon a common prime meridian, and approves of tbo projeot to reorganize the diplomatic and con- sular service, leaving fees to innure to the heuetit or the Treasury. -His detailed statement, of the condi tion of the Treasury shows that the reveuua last year from all sources was $403,525,250 ; the total expenditure for ordinary purposes was $257,981,440 ; leaving a surplus of $145,543,810. This with $20,737,695 of spare cash already iu the Treasury, was applied to payiug off $166,281,505 of the public debt du rfng.the year. In view of the plet.hotio condition of the Treasury, the President and Secre tary Folger both unite in recommend ing a redacti<m of internal revenues. The Presides t recommends the aboli tion of all intorual revenue taxes ex cept the one ou tobacco in Its various forms, aud upon distilled spirits aud fermented liquors aud wines, except also, the special tax upon the manufac ture of all liquors iu such articles. In referiug to this question, he says : "Such a courso, if accompanied by a compllfloation of the machinery of col lection which would lie easy of accom plishment, might reasonably be expec ted to result in diminishing the cost of, such collection by at least $2,500,000, and in the retirement from office of from 1500 to 2000 persons. The system of excise duties has never commended itself to the favor of the American peo ple, and has never been resorted to ex cept for supplying deficiencies in the treasury, wlieu, by reasuu ef special exigencies, the duties on imports have proved inadequate for the needs of the Government. The sentiment of the country doubt less demands that the present excise tax shall be abolished as soon as such a course can be safely pursued. It seems to me, however, that for various rea sons so sweeping a measure as the total abolition of internal taxes would for the present bo an nnwlae step. Two of these reasons are deserving of special mention. First. It is by no means clear that even if the existing system of duties of imports is continued without modification, those duties alone will yield sufficient revenue for all the needs of the Goaernment. It is estimated that one hundred millions of dollars will be required for pensions during the ooming year, and ft may well be doubt ed if the maximum annual demaud for that object has yet been reached. Un certainty upon this question would alone justify, in my judgment, the re tention for the present of that portion of the system of internal revenue which is least objectionable to the people. The Prosident declares .himself in favor of tariff reform and reoommends a careful consideration of the report of the tariff commission. The message speaks of the necessity of strengthening our fortifications, re commends better provision for arming aud equipping the militia, and calls at tention to embairassments growing out of the acts for retiring army offi cers. The President pauses to justify his veto of the River and Harbor hill in the following language: ''An act making appropriations for the construction, repair and preserva tion of certain works on rivers and har bors," which became a law near the close of your last session, prompt me to express the hope that no similar meas urea tviir be deemed necessary during the present session of Congress. In deed a measure would now be open to a serious objection in addition to t.hat which was lately urged upon your at tention. I am informed by the 8ecre tary of War that the greater portion of the sum appropriated for the various items specified in that act remain un expended. Of the new works which it authorized, expenses have been incurr ed upon two only, for which the total appropriation was $210,000. From the Secretary's report Presi dent Arthur states that the available naval foroe of the United States con sists of thirty-seven cruisers, fourteen single turreted monitors, built during the rebellion, a large number of smooth bore guns acil parrot rifles, and eighty seven rifled cannons. The oruising ves sels should be gradually replaced by iron or steel ships, the monitors by modern armored vesselB, and the ar mament by high-power rifted guns. The President describes the Jeannette aud Hedgers Arctic expeditions aud oloses bis reference to the Navy partment by calling attention to the importance of fostering the commercial marine of the united States, hut makes no definite recommendation on the sub , . A reduction of postage to two cents is recommended and the President re ter ring to the Star Route trials says: f If any guilty persons Bhall Anally es ami jeot. cape puniahment for their offenOM it will uot be for lack of diligent and earnest efforts on the part of the prose cution. A national bankrupt law is recom mended and also the regulation of inter state commerce by Congress; and ad ditional legislation for the preservation of forest| on the public domain, espe cially in the extreme Western States and Territories. Civil service reform claimed a con siderable share of the President's atten tion and he says : I trust that before the close of the present session some decisive action may be taken for the correction ot the evils which inhere in the present meth ods of appointment, aud assure you of my hearty co-operation in any meas ures wiiieh are likely to conduce to that end. As to the most appropriate term aud tonure of the official lifeot the subordinate employes of the Govern ment it seems to be generally agreed that whatever their extent or charac ter the one should be definite and the other stable,aud thal^neither should be regulated by zeal in the service of party or fidelity to the fortunec of the Indi vid uals It matters little to the people at large what competent person is at the head of thiH department or that bureau if they feel assured that the removal of one and the accession of another will not in volve ihe retirement of honest and faithful subordinates whose duties are purely administrative, and have no legitimate connection with the triumph of any political principles or the suc cess of any political party or faction. It is to this latter class of officers that the Senate bill to which I have already referred exclusively applies. Evidently not relishing the criticisms of the public press in relation to re movals from office without cause the President feels bound to defend him self, and says : I feel bound to correct a misapprehension as to the frequency with which the present executive has displaced the incumbent, of an office and appointed another in his stead. It has been repeatedly alleged that be has in this particular signally departed from the course which has been pur sued under recent administrations of the Government. The facts are as fol lows : The whole number of Executive appointments during the four years immediately preceding Mr. Garfield's accession to the Presidency was 2696— of this number 244 or 0 per cent, in volved the removal of previous incum bents. The ratio of removals to the whole number of appointments was much the same during each of those four .years. I u the first year, with 790 appointments there were 74 removals, or 9 3 per cent.; iu the seoori'l, with 917 appointments, there were 85 removals, or 8 5 per cent.; in the third, with 480 appointments, thete were 48 removal?, or 10 per cent.; in the fourth, with 420 appointments, there were 37 removals, or 8.0 per cent. In the four months of President Gar field's administration there were 390 appointments and 89 removals, or 22.7 percent. Precisely the same number of removals (89) has taken place in the fourteen months which have since elapied, but they constitute only 7.8 per cent, of the whole number of ap pointments (1118) within that period aud less than 2.6 of the eutire list of officials (34G9 exclusive of the army and navy) which is tilled by Presiden tial appointment. JAY 

HUBBELL SNUBBED. Referring to political assessments the President says : In duly last,I author ized a public announcement that em ployes ot the .Government should re gard themselves as at liberty to exer cise their pleasure in making or refus ing to make political contribution*,and that their action iu that regard would in no manner affect their official status. In this announcement 1 acted upon the view that 1 had always maintained, and still maintain, that a public officer should be as absolutely free as any oth er citizen to give or to withhold a con tribution for the aid of the political party of his choice. It has, however, been urged, aud doubtless not without foundation iu fact, that by solicitation of superiors and by other modes suoh contributions have at times been ob tained from persons whose only motive for giving has been the fear of what might befall them if they refused. It goes without saying that such contribu tions are not voluntary, and, in my judgment, their collection should be prohibited by law. A bill which will effectually suppress them will receive my cordial approval. * The President hopes that Congress will agree upon a system of ascertain ing the vote for Presidential electors and the extent of the Constitution iu its provisions for devolving executive functions upon the Vice President when the President suffers from ina bility to discharge the powers and du ties of his office and trusts that no em barrassments may result from a failure to determine these questions before another Natioual election. The message closes with a review of the blessings of the year for which he says : We owe to the giver of all good cur reverent acknowledgments. For the uninterrupted harmony of our foreign relations ; for the decay of sectional auimosities ; for the exuberauce of our harvests and the tri umphs of our min ing and manufacturing industries ; for the prevalence of health, the spread of intelligence and the consecration of the public credit ; for the growth of t.be country in all the elements of national greatness—for these and count ess other blessings—we should rejoice and be glad. I trust that, under the inspira tion of this great, prosperity, our coun sets may be harmonious, aud tuat the dictates of prudence, patriotism, justice and economy may lead to the adoption of measures in which the Congress aud the Executive may heartily unite.

The faults of a fool are concealed from him self while they are evldeat io the world; on the other hand,tho faults of the wise man are well known to him a elf, while they masked over and invisible to the world.

Kind words and looks are the outward demonstrations; pattenoe and forbearance are the sentiments within. Charity, er love, Is the connecting link whloh unites earth to heaven, and man to man.

WASuiuoi'ojr, D. C., December 4th, 1883. The National colors have again been run up at each end of the Capitol, In dicating that the Senate and the House are in seseion. The usual crowd made up largely of trausieut visitors assem bled to witness the opening of Con gress; all the galleries were crowded to overflowing aod many who were bl« to obtain admission remained out side iu the lobbies or strolled about the corridors. The opening euenes in the Senate aud in the House were no varia tion from the familiar routine. Until the speaker's gavel tell the House was as boisterous as bedlam, while the Sen ate preserved its traditional dignity well that it seemed almost superfluous for the Falstaffian vice president to call it to order. The rotunda of the Capitol presents a curious appearance to Its familiar babitnes. The his oric pictures of ths signing of "the Declaration ot Independence;" "The Marriage of Pocahontas "The Surrender of Cornwallis" and others have been concealed under maroon our tains, and in their place are hung numerous paintings of smaller Bias loaned to the Garfield Monument Fair. The Old Hall of Representatives is fall of gaadj pavilions in whlob are sold as great a variety of articles as can be found at a country store. The ignoble temporary use to wtiioh the Capitol has been put, seems at first jarriugly oat of place, but, on roflaotlou, oue remem bers that his country's Capitol has been the scene of bolder bargains and less lnnooent traffic. It is doubtful if the Garfield fair will realize the expecta tion of its managers. The attendance has-uot been as large as was expected, and booths, with the exception of the one managed by the professional beauty,Miss Gipsie Gilbert have not paid. Miss Gilbert has not only sustained her part tn the Langtry role, bat she has established a reputa tion as a saleswoman by strict attention to business. With a votoe as sweet as Bernhart's she asks you to buy a Gar field poem for thirty-five cents; those eyes aud teeth and that cheek are ir resistable, but the poem is a wretched gilt edgedoggerel of the adulatory style, probably written by some oue whe wanted a government olerkship. It is thought that this will be an iu teresting winter in Washington politi cally aud socially. The forty-seventh Congress will expire by limitation on the 4'.h of March, and it is expected it will make the most of the brief remnant of its term. Lent oornes very early this season aud society Is expected to "dance till morn when yonth aud pleasure meet." Wealthy and distinguished people are arriving from ail quarters, lor ihe reputation of the new Wash ington as the faskionable.winter resort of this country is established. Many will remain here throughout the eutire season, while inauy more will make shorter visits or flying excursions to the city. Not to have seen this Mecca of the politician, this paradise of the wealthy and of the fashionable, this microcosm of every thing American, is to have missed amoh. The Appropriations Committee of the House has two bills ready far imme diate attention. Some members and Senators talk as if they intended to work twenty-five hours a day from now uutil the fourth ot Maroh. The coun try need not, however, dread a Niagara of legislation. Congress will, as usual, assemble about 12 M. and, if it UaHaqucrnm, prooeedto business. It will adjourn about 4 V. M. and take a good Christ mas rest of two weeks. uua ao A Sew Tbsurf. A Sootoh olergyman, Dr. Waddell, thinks be has found out what Is finally to become of Satan, the father of all evil. The learned divine reads the eo lution of the problem in the revelation of an angel coming down with a chain and a key aud binding the dragon and casting him into the bottomless pit. The augel, he says, 1* electrloal ecienoe; the chain is a coil of telegraph wire, and the key is the telegraph key. The angel of the dream has oome down with the coiUuid the key and is encir cling the world with chain lightning. The preacher sai h that in exactly the proportion that eleotricity enoirclee the world evil will be defeated and tbe regeneration of mankind will progrees. In this view telegraph wire stretchers and telegraph operators will supplant preachers and the electric light is a beaoon of paradise.
