FIELD, Nev., Dec 4. The ex ecutive committee of the Mine Owners' association of Goldfield tonight re ceived assurances from Governor Sparks that he had called upon "Wash ington, requesting that Government troops be held in readiness for uso in I he Nevada mining camps and that a garrison of regulars be established at Goldfield. There is nothing in the immediate situation ti require the intervention of troops. Tho town is aa quiet as usual. But it is feared by the mine owners that trouble is brewing and that overt acls might, be committed at any time. The strike is af. a deadlock, and the mine owners propose, to keep the mines shut, down until the violent element of the Miners' Union and the lawless ele ment, generally in the camp arc com pelled to- leave. Union Ptrnds Low. wtr. , The Miners'" Union is not prepared lo make a long fight, as their treasury is depleted.-and it is believed that for I his ..reason ..the miners will force the issue by violence, as has been threatened. Money has been scarce iu Goldfield since two of the banks closed.- and scrip re sorted to by the third bank, and as all the mines have been shut down for sev eral days the pinch of poverty is beinc felt by the miners, who, as a rule, are an improvident lot, living from baud to mouth. Holdups and burglaries have been frequent, or late, attributable to this fact, and there is a general feeling of unrest, which is likob- to break out into a general riot before long. II is for proteclionary reasons more than be cause of an acute situation that, has im pelled the call for troops. Oau Get Troops in Ten Hours. When the committee queried tho Governor what he would do with re spect to a call for Government troops, sliould conditions arise seeming to re quire them, he answered I hat he had already takou the matter up with Washington ten days before. The nearest troops are at the Presidio at San Francisco, eighteen honrs distance by special train. The mining camps all over Nevada are co-operating with the Goldfield mine operators, and are acti ing in harmony with them. The miners know that in' all the large camps of the country that hundreds of miners are walking the streets out of employ ment, and there is nowhere for the Goldfield miners to go. This is tho last stand apparently to be made by tho Western Federation of Miners, am! it is expected that, they will make a bitter and desperate light- President McKennon of ocal miners' union has instructed the miners against violence or notation on the st recti. Their plans are as secret, as those of tho mine operators,

George "Wingfield. chief operator of this district, left the city yesterday and is eaid to have spent the day in Reno with the Governor, urging him to lake action to prepare for trouble. Keporls of rioting and bloodshed were sent over the country yesterday and last evening, but all were without foun dation. There was not .even one street brawl. Howeyer. the situation is ex ceedingly intmse and something is likolv to break out at any time. The j conservative element of the miners' or j ganization, tit next Tuesday 'h meeting, will make a determined effort to ad i just the principal of the pending dif ficulties and then the way for a re- sumutiou of operations. ! The minors have voted to stick, and ' the camp is idle. Not a pound of ore 1 is being sent out. The men say their ' contract with tho employers was for mine money, not scrip, in wages and 'that when "the operators formally no ; tified them that, they could not pay wages, except in scrip, this constituted an abrogation of the agreement. Ou I the other hand, tho operntora say they ' cannot pav in money on account of the closing of the .banks that sunply 1 the money market and tho. inability to compcl'tho smelter trust to tnko orp3 from this part of the State at this time.
