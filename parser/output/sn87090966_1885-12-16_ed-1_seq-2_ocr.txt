TiiE'revlral metlni: continue to draw crowded homes, but converts nr. only of the nrgatlre character. Tkxub towns subscribed $02,033.08 of the $12.1,519.57 donnted to the iufTerrn of the Galveston lire, which li a glonlng pig. In the hlitory of the State. Tin wnter-worli question la rapidly t'ecomleg an laaue, In which the few era hare been loat alght of. Candldatea whoae platform la city water-works next winter, will be overwhelmingly elected. Tnit llaaonNewa aaya that the people of that aeotlnn ar. ready to atart the railroad enterprise, from San Antonio up through the northwest, provided the people of San Antonio put up $150,000 ot the amount. Tub Waco Day aaya ; "Boycotting has taken a new turn In Philadelphia, where merchants and dealera hare been warned not to aell to or deal with non-union men. If thla thing goea on, we shall aoon have to brand men as we do cattle to know who la who." The Ulategue Hospital, Just completed In the City of Mexico, cost $100,000, and accommodates only 100 patients, while the new City Hospital In this city, In course of conatructlon, will cost only $32,000, with every modern appliance, and It will accommodate E0 patients. A okkat many papers have b.sn wasting time and space discussing tbelr candidates for Governor and other State olllccs, which considering the fact that the election Is about a year on, Is a lit tle premature. An energetic number of "kids" may be able to capture the con vention before the "wah bosses" get Into line. CntTiiN cOl.lous defead.rs or the Water-works speak of the generosity of that company In furnishing the city with sparkling water. Some people might put considerable stress upon the statement, If It were not known that th. water supply belongs to the city, as one of the vested rights of years ago. Mr. Ilrackenrldge simply pumps It up and puts about three prices upon It as his charge for furnishing It. ItKntESKNTATIVB WallXKK SSJS Of that part of the President's message relating to the silver question : "I do not agree with the President's views upon the sil ver question. There are some things possible and some things Impossible. It Is Impossible to have a oontractlon of the ourrenoy to the extent of one-third of It by taking gold out or olroulatlon and at the same time have what Is left depre ciated by 20 per cent., as It Is asserted will be the case. Such a thing never took place In any country In the world In any age, and It never can." "Commmicul bodies throughout the country," says the Cincinnati Times Star, "are pleased with the silver sug gestions or the President and Secretary Manning. Many or them will have something to say to Congress before th. end orthe session In favor of susuendlnir coinage till there shall have been an ad Justment of relations between the two money metala. Among eagaclous men ofaflalrslt Is the common orlnlon thst the danger of depreciated silver haa more to do Just now In preventing the revival and expansion of business the threatened tariff agitation." Tim deolded stand taken by Mr. W, D. Cleveland and several others In Houston regarding the boycott of the Age by the Knights of Labor, will serve as an example In future rackets of that kind, and reduce In some respects the natural inconvenience created by a boy- oott. Mr. Cleveland aet an example which was quickly followed by a num- birof people In Houston, who without sjcIi a leader would have aooeded to the demands of the boycotters. It Is noticeable, too, that the tone of the State papers has changed In the past few weeks from a weak remonstrance with the Knights to an out and out opposition totbe general polloy of the boycotters. The lloerne Advance says: "The San Antonio I.ioiit is waging a savage war upon the Water-worka monopoly. The Liciiit appears to have Justice on lis side." "The paper wad tired at the free grass harnna tiv ilovrrnnr Ir lanu liss not vet hit to hurt much. Not a single convic tion and none likely to ie, unless me fierce State executive follows President Cleveland's example by giving them a certain time In which to vacate or h. wilt bounce them bodily. He has six companies of rangers at hla command, but lacka the bsck bone of the Demo cratic President for which the bourbons have been praying so long. When nrnver sari "irlt" thev sit and don't you forget It. When John, of Seguln, says go, they answer, "not ir we anow ourselves, and you dare not put us out." That's the difference of the Democratic President and the Demooratlo Ooveraor of th. banner Democratic State. The New York Sun In an article hint ing that Miss Cleveland wrote part of ii. ir..i!flnt'. uipasacAsafs: "If Miss Cleveland did, as appears to be the case, lurnlsh her Droiner wnn tue mosi in. .ml ener.eils oassace In bis dis cussion or the Mormon problem, the tact Is certainly very interesting, is is per Inn. the first time in the history or the United States that a woman hns con trlbuted so Important a part or so Ito .iiiii mi. i. tim.r. The Incident Is equally creditable to the President and to Ulss Cleveland, and we need mat. no ...nlrnrf for vIl.UllllLT. fuf tbls UnC. tbf taolt convention which treats the annual If ihev Here the product lull of a single pen and necessarily the work of the President himself throughout." To the l.ionr: The Times was never "toady" enough to leave Its own party, betray Its political friends and sell nut, lock, stock and barrel, for a stipulated price, to another polllloal party. Ibis iha l.imiT did. bv lis own conlesslnn, In the last municipal election," In the last municipal election there wero three Democrats, and no Ilepubll- can running for Mayor, therefore the Light had to choose rrom what politi cally would be considered on Its part, as three evils. Mr. Ilryan Laiiagnan was nlnated on the following platrorm: n..r,w,.flT That the vital Interests orthe city Imperatively require that the POIICy OI tne incoming lllj aumiuiaiin- lion bo a prudent and progressive one, .,i ih.fiir demand that there shall be Inaugurated and completed a thorough system OI urainagoioriue ouy ami maeailamlilnir or oavlniT or the streets and plazas, the laying or side- aixs and crossings. "Thai aa anno as it can MIBllblV be done, we are In ravor or the acquisi tion by the city ol a complete system oi ntcr-woras, oy ixm.ua '"
