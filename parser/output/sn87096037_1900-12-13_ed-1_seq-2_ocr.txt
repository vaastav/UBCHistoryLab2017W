Prior to the election the re publican state committee made an es timate based on.reports from chair man of county committee's and prom inent party workers. TJhe total vote of the, state, according to the com mittee's estimate, was 58,590, and the total vote as counted was 57,841). The total.yote for McKinley as estimated by the committee was 35,700 and the total vote returned for him was 35,895. The total vote for judges in the sev eral districts is announced as follows, with all counties officially reported, but not yet canvassed: First—Fisk, 2,MSG Anderson, 488.

Seventh—Kneeshaw's majority 311 canvass not made. The total vote of the state shows an increase of 10,000 6ver that of four years ago, and an increase of 12,000 over that cast for congresman two years ago.

The majority for McKinley in the state increase almost exactly with the increase in the vote.

There were the usual throngs in the galleries and the usual display of floral pieces on the floor, but the proceedings were purely formal, consisting of the rapping to order by the speaker, prayer by the chaplain, the roll-call of members, the appoint ment of the formal committees to wait on the president and the reception and reading of the president's message. Despite the fact that a great presiden tial campaign had concluded within a month, the best of feeling seemed to prevail between victors and vanquished. The reading of the message, which nat urally was the feature of the day, oc cupied over two hours. It was listened to with respectful interest by both sides. The deaths of the late Repre sentatives Daly (N. J.) and Hoffecker (Del.), and Senators Davis (Minn.) and Gear (la.) were announced, and, as a further mark of respect to their mem ories, the house adjourned until to day Washington, Dec. 4.—When the sen« ate convened it was within the shadow of the death of two of its most dis tinguished members. Since the sen ate last convened a great national campaign had been inaugurated and conducted to a conclusion, and as senators assembled they exchanged political greetings as well as the warm handclasps of personal friend ship. A notable meeting on the floor just before the session opened was that between Senators Hanna (O.) and Jones (Ark.), the chairmen, re spectively, of the republican and dem ocratic national campaign commit tees. Surrounded by many of their colleagues, they exchanged cordial greetings and laughed and chatted for several minutes. The president's message was read and the death of Senators Gear and Davis was announced. Appropriate resolutions were adopted and as an additional mark of respect for the memories of Senator Gear and Sena tor Davis, the senate at 3:45 p. m. adjourned.
