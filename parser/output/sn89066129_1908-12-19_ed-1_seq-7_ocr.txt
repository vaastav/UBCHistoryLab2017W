After Inflammatory Rheumatism, Hair Came Out, Skin Peeled, and Bed Sores Developed Only Cutl cura Proved Successful. "About four years ago I had a very severe attack of inflammatory rheuma tism. My skin peeled, and the high fever played havoc with my hair, which came out in bunches. I also had three large bed sores on my back. I did not gain very rapidly, and my appetite was very poor. I tried many 'sure cures' but they were, of little help, and until I tried Cuticura Re solvent I had had no real relief. Then my complexion cleared and soon I felt better. The bed sores went very soon after a few applications of Cuticura Ointment, and when I used Cuti cura Soap and Ointment for my hair it began to regain its former glossy ap pearance. Mrs. Lavlna J.

Why Joyner Left Home. "Are you ready to receive the obli gations?" asked the most upright su preme hocus-pocus of the Order of Hoot Owls. "I am," said the candidate, firmly. "Then take a sip of this prusslc acid, place your right hand in this pot of boiling lead, rest your left hand upon this revolving buzz-saw, close ycjr eyes and repeat after me " Early next morning shreds of Joy ner's clothing were found upon the bushes and trees all along the road to Pottsville, 30 miles distant, and at Scrabbletown, 69 miles away, he was reported still headed west. Judge. Laundry work at home would b much more satisfactory if the right Starch were used. In order to get the desired stiffness, it is usually neces sary to ussj so much starch that tho beauty and fineness of the fabric is hidden behind a paste of varying thickness, which not only destroys the appearance, but also affects the wear ing quality of the goods. This trou ble can be entirely overcome by using Defiance Starch, as it can be applied much more thinly because of its great er strength than other makes. The Color Line Again.
