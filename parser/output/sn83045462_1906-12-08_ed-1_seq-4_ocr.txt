Nobody in the House prt'r-arctf to t A recess follows. Twenty precious minutes Bi> hv. anil forever. Would anybody believe tliis if the record did not hoar it out"? But the record exists, and should not be forgotten. Friday, December 7, is the day. and the glorious timp nn.mproved hetwei ii 2:40 and 3 o'clock in the afternoon. And yet there are members who complain of gag rules, and declare that tney ore not permitted to rave the country by their eloiiuence. Chailes A. Towne told a western audience some mouths a^n that he had no "show" under the Cannon dispensation, and on that account was going into private life. H.' did not add, he mi ht have done, that the hoss of Tammany Hall, from whom lie had received his lat?st commission, looked approvingly unon his decision. But we muvt remember ;he condition that brought abou* this < xtraordinary episode. The leader of the House proposed a topic, and the toi?ie was the President's message. I* was that which the statesman pause. Nobody cared?dared. let us sa> t?> taekle that formidable document off hand. All had heard the clerk read it. and then had read it themselves, and they considered silence, for the moment, to be the better part of valor. Probably they were risht. The message is a very important nauer? f.ir and away the most interesting the President has written. It is not to be tackled "unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently. discreetly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear of" the future. The republican member must consider that the author is the leader of his party, and that, however startling some of the views expressed, the party two years lienoe may be nsked to write them into its national platform. The democratic member, however much he may applaud this feature or that, must consider that b\ too great and indiscriminate praise of tile paper and its suggestions now he might load shells for the opposition to be used in ltWS. Hence the caution. Hence the refusal of members yesterday to rise to Leader Payne's bait, and discuss subjects. some of which can wait, and all of which reouire thought. v The House, then, despite the jeers of its enemies, is, or may be easily made, a deliberative body. It does not always hurry into action. Here was a chance and a temptation for everybody, but nobody improved it. All sat inute. and the Speaker's gavel fell on the motion for a recess without a protest from either side. And, all tliinKS considered, it was a tiash of very eloquent silence. ' Mark Twain's Clothes. Mark Twain, in j cream-colored suit in December strifecs an uutisuui ntjle in the scheme of things. His argument that men <5t? :ss too dolefully is worth considering. As long as a man is warm enough, what matters it whether he wears outside the clotl.es of summer or winter hue? Imagination plays a great parfin adjusting our habits, and it has undoubtedly caused the abandonment by most men of all the tones of garb which are usually associated with the warm season. Scientists will tell you that white clothes are better to wear in summer because they reflect rather than absorb the heat. But this r.rgument does not hold good in winter as a reverse propoU i t i j.?i 1' n ? - * anwctv*, 11 I'umips jn summer allow the heat of the sun to penetrate to the body, do not black clothes in winter allow the heat of the body to escape to the outer air? Mark Twain takes a sensible view of this matter, even though he is a professional humorist. He- is. in truth, endowed with an unusually large More of common sense. Perhaps that is why he is so successful as a humorist. It often happens that the funniest things in the >rld are those that are ernsible. And one of the prime qualities of American humor is its appeal to the understanding. Therein, argue some patriots, lies the essential difference between the American and the Briti.sli brands of humor. If we begin to wear white clothes in winter, tl.us upsetting our sartorial traditions, we max possibly progress to other departures from the conventional garb of men. There are those who sigh for the good old days of picturesque costumes, kneeTireeches, silk stockings, ruffled shit ts and all that. Now and then the followers of h sport will undertake to blaze their way through the prim laws of haberdashery and inject a little color Into our man-BC.me But the hoi polloi are usually impatient with these Innovators, and treat them as "dudes" and cranks. Maybe the illustrious example of Mark Twain, who has a grip on the American 8)mpathics that is enjoyed by few other men, not excepting statesmen and actors, will cause a more lenient attitude on the part of the gnat body of the people toward the advocates of more picturesqueness in our garb. We need something to liven us : up in these stern and strenuous dais, and i perhaps the immortal Mark has given us a \uluable cue. A man who is as extremely busy as President Roosevelt has become, naturally dislikes to have his time taken up with arguments about whether a naval officer shall be dismissed. It is only n little over two weeks till Christinas. Now is the time to shop. The Japanese Question. The exclusion of the .Iflmini'sp frrtm *Iia common schools of California has become a serious matter, and now the suggestion is made that an act should be secured from Congress, excluding the Japanese as a people from the I'nited States, as the Chinese are now excluded. White only local today. It Is probable that this anti-Japanese propaganda may extend to other Pacific states, and then throughout the west. So far, however, no good reason has been advanced for Japanese exclusion, excepting a hint that they might "overrun" this country. The question, under such circumstances. Is: Would the United States profit, lose or remain stationary if a steady stream of j Japanese immigration should empty itself Along our Paciilc coast? It is well known ' by us that the Japanese are certainly noth- I Ing If not up to date as a nation. They are proud of the:.- position In the circle of the groat powers, and If they are determined to use it to its fullest meaning, its deepest im port, they cannot oe oianifa. wun in?-ir | modern army and their modern navy, the J people of the empire have won for them- 1 #clvc? m u?o?i suUBiaciwrjc ctcdit abroad- j According to American i>rtnc?i>!es, the nation that can handle its finances is far ahead of the one that cannot; therefore Japan is ahead. After the famine of l?st year was fully investigated by government officials, they came to the conclusion that Jaiian was overcrowded in sections. The origination '? " n^lntilul u/'Vi^mua fIM- tho Sottifjrroilt Of ihe newly acquired lands in Manchuria and Korea did rot seem, upon thorough study, to afford all of the relict necessary. Accordingly, Japanese immigration to other part3 of the world was encouraged, and thp tlrst batch went to the Philippines. Now they hope to enter the British colonitfs in South Africa, and the consent of Kngland is not difficult to obtain in view of the demand for unskilled l!?.bor for the mines. Notwithstanding all local hitches, as the California incident may be termed as it stands today, and as the Japanese govern ment officially regards it?according to the highest authority?American opinion has from the beginning been in favor of Japan. This is <lue principally to the history and the geographical situation of tnis country. The cry of the late war about a yellow race against a white race, of barbarians against a civilized people, of pagans against Christians. made no impression upon Americans. This is because ever since Columbus discovered America our progress has been westward; so much so that it has readied ea st. President Tyler, as early as 184''., wrote to the Emperor of China ttuit the domains of ther.e two rulers touched but for the ocean. ; Ten years later Perry opened Japan to the commerce of the west. All routes to the Pacific are In American possession. With the Aleutians 0*1 the north and the Philippines on the south, the I'nited States theoretically surrounds the Japanese domain. For this reason, both Japan and this country, each Independently of the other. ;ire noi inclined 10 seen a misunaersianuing. j engaged as they are in making an historic | march to the extreme far east, and to strengthen the ties of humanity, regardless of race hatred. Minors and Liquor. Maj. Sylvester has called to the attention 6f the Commissioners a matter which demands immediate and corrective attention l>y bolh the Commissioners and Congress. He states that members of his force frequently find boys under the influence of liquor, but have been unable, owing to the present state of the law. to secure convic- | tion of persons who are responsible for their condition. The existing excise law prohibits, under penalty, the selling of liquor to minors, but there is a provision which permits vendors to sell liquor when the minor has been provided with a note from the parent or guardian. Such notes, it is believed, are frequently forged. In some cases they are given by the parents or guardians to enable them to obtain liquors or beer from saloons without themselves going in person. l}uite beyond the range of the law at present is the practice ..f n^..ifj i;~. * \n auuiia ^ivui^ 3 I'tj'.IUI IU 

UI1IIK, irOIIl an incomprehensible desire to*see them under its influence, or possibly to forward their own base ends. The excise law should be immediately strengthened by eliminating all manner of provision for the dispensing of liquor or beer to or through the agency of minors, thus putting the vendor under a strict prohibition which renders the presence of a minor in such a place a misdemeanor on the minor's part and proof of neglect of his own duty on the part of the proprietor. Furthermore, a new provision should be enacted whicti punishes with a severe pen ?iuj ci 11 > jiii 11 v\ 11 v_? ui giving or seiiing liquor or beer to a minor, for whatever purpose or in whatever circumstances. The only safe exception to such a sweeping prohibition is that physicians, or parents may in cases of sickness .administer liquor to children. The spectacle of boys under the influence of liquor is too shocking to be pernjltted longer to continue than may be necessary for the enactment of the desired law. A m<in crii-o > hnf li n 11 n P ic Himcnlf a debased creature and has earned Bharp punishment. The saloon-keeper who will permit boys to loiter in his establishment, even though he does not furnish them with drink, should be exeiuded from business. The evil of the drink habit is menacing enough as it now is without permitting its extension to the juveniles through the cupidity or the maliciousness or the thoughtlessness of adults. The desired amendments to the law should be promptly enacted by Congress as a step toward the maintenance of a proper standard ol decency and morality in the District of Columbia. Cuban Politics. This is taken from a Havana cable: "The difficulty in Cuban politics is that too much prominence is given to personal hatreds, and that there is such w'de divergence of opinions as to the management of the public business." Which is to say that Cuban politics is like the politics of other countries. Where does not the personal equation enter? Sharp rivalries, even iy America, sometimes beget the bitterest animosities. As to a "wide divergence of opinions as to the management of the public business," that is what the Cubans are there for. It explains their existence as citizens. In what country where the people are permitted to think do we find them all in agreement j about anything? The lesson the Cubans have to learn, and must learn before they can hope to make a success of popular government, is to submit to the rule of the majority, and to respect the ballot box. The difficulty in getting the inhabitants of the Philippines to lay down their bolos is a:.other obstacle to the freedom which many Americans so generously desire to accord them. Tliere was a time when the Eastern branch was navigable for a considerable distance, litre is a river and harbor possibility that appears to have been overlooked. It is rather heartless to compel Mr. Hearst to declare his campaign expenses. No man likes to talk about it when - - has been utterly wasteful. Tlve emotio-.al insanity plea is almost as vague and hazardous as the defense that lies on unwritten law. The attitude ot the railways will make it necessary for this city to put up another "no smoking" sign. The history of China has been of great value to Japan as a horrible example. The Yudin Collection. By acquiring the Yudln collection of books on Russian and Siberian subjects, the Library of Congress has expanded its usefulness in the field of world research. Tnese volumes, scene 80,000 in number, will I bo of great value to students, even though doubtless in the main lu the Russian language. Their presence here will i accentuate the status of this capital as a ' literary center, and will undoubtedly attract here many persons engaged in researches. Herein lies the unique character t>? Washington, -which is being steadily recognised more broadly. The develop ment of we uorary 01 congress aiong these lines, similar to the expansion of the British Museum, together with the evolution of the scientific bureaus of the govei nment, must demonstrate to thinkers and writers and investigators thAt the capital of the United States is an idyal place for their work. The motive which animated M. Yudin in consenting to the transfer of his valuable collection "to tlie Library of Congress Is easily to be appreciated. This library, he , feels, will serve its best purposes at the American capital, where it will possibly result in a systematic study of Russian history and institutions and in a broader and more intelligent understanding of the Russian ideals and limitations. Whether it will cause a 'better feeling between the two peoples must be left to the future for decision. Meanwhile Librarian Putnam is to be congratulated upon his success in actui nif, ou iciiiui !\auic an aixcssiuu. It is now stated that there were no threats of Iynehlng Gillette should the jury fail to convict. It does not appear that there was enough chance of such a failure to cause much excitement. Railway men say that nearly all the legislation directed against them turns out ultimately to their benefit. So there does not appear to be much use in hanging out against electric motors. It must be conceded that many of the moral admorritions which the President Kives from time to time, are so obviously correct as to admit of no argument whatever. It would doubtless be unjust to harbor a suspicion that the Japanese cherish any resentment in connection with that peace conference at Portsmouth. Japan Is careful to allow all the war talk to come from this side of the ocean. 

SHOOTING STARS. An Ample Explanation. "A great many of your predictions are inaccurate," said the critical person. "My predictions are always accurate," answered the weather prophet. "But the climate is so variable that the weather sometimes changes just before it arrives." The Only Chance. "It is no longer possible for a man to succeed In politics merely by spending money." "No," answered Senator Sorghum, "the chances now are that the opposition will have as much as vou can eet together. The only chance is to show superior smartness in placing it." * Contrast. It doth perplex poor mortal man Xhe weather's change to note. One minute he requires a fan And next an overcoat. Not Afraid. "Some day," said the alarmist, "the railway men will be running this government." "Well," answered Mr. Dustin Stax, complacently, "if they were to run it as well as they do some of the railways, it wouldn't be such a bad idea." Study. "A member of Congress must make a great study of political economy in order to fill his position creditably." "Yes," answered the statesman who favors higher salaries, "and a still greater study of personal economy." Consider the Lilies. I wisht I was a congressman A-stayin' up o' nights; A-gettin' up some great big plan. Or showin' folks de sights; A-smilin' pleasant as de sun An' shakin' hans' wlf every one! I'd 'like to have some work like dat, Jes' talk de whole year through, An' wear a shiny beaver hat, Siimu fis ri** nnrson do. Not doin' much at al4, you see, 'Cep' lettin'.people vote fob me! Another Etui to War. From the New Orleans Times-Democrat. Several times each year appears a gentleman who is determined to provide some mechanical device that will make the waging of war impossible. These announcements are made with some regularity, and perhaps have been for centuries. It is not I linlikelv that when Aaron betran his ad i vance into the Promised Land there apj peared one who informed him that he had about completed an invention lhat would make war impossible. These optimists entirely overlook the fact that for every deadly lead there is an equally deadly guard, and that he who invents a terrible weapon of war and find some one on the other side to provide a means of neutralizing the importance of his invention. New York. Frum the >ew York Sun. The moral nature and the moral common yense of this town are perhaps none too sensitive. They are very much the same as those of any other big and overcrnwn pnirimiiiiitv in anv nart of the world. In fact, we can stand almost anything that any other town can stand. But what we cannot stand and will not put up with is the furtive and criminal compact between vice and authority. We can tolerate and we can be indifferent to an immense amount of the various evils that infest society (and we ought, no doubt, to be deeply ashamed of it), but we never get really stirred to resentment, never get I heated to real passion, until we unearth ! denravitv in the relation of vice with the law. Debt Owed to Antiquity. From the Portland Oregonian. Are we indebted to antiquity? Yes, immensely. It is the labor, the experience, even the failures of ancestors that have placed us where we are. We still repeat many of their mistaken experiments, which they thought wise. It was tentative effort | with them, though mistaken, and they did the best they knew. But. on the whole, the world is doing well. Its chief debt to an| tiquity is in the lessons it has learned through which it avoids or may avoid repetition of old errors and absurdities. Penalty of Foolish Talk. From the New Tork Mall. It is a brutal fact that, barring the doi main of the penal code, men suffer more 1 for what they say than for what they do. A foolish speech or a witless interview will tell against a man more than a mistaKen vote or a shortsighted act. Many a promising career has been blighted by the gratuitous word. This looks like injustice, but is simply the penalty of forfeiting a forbearing presumption. Steel Fire-Proof Cars. From the Springfield Union. If there is any one fact indicated by the train wreck on the Southern railway in which President Spencer was killed and I the later one at Vergennes. Vt., in which three or four lives were lost, it is the need of steel, fireproof cars. Following Precedent. From the Chicago Record-Herald. lias Mr. Cortelyou selected the New York trust company that he will become president of when he gets through being Secretary .of the Treasury? ?? 1 1 ??? As Bad as ThisP Fruui the Houston Post. Mr. Roosevelt will be remembered as the President who created precedents where none existed and broke all those created by his predecessors. Troubles Come Not Singly. From the Kow York Evening Post. First the earthquake, then Schmitz and tiie labor unions, and now the Big Stick. Poor old Golden Gate! Prosperity. From the Knozrllle Journal and Tribune. This country has never before been so embarrassed with the congestion of prosperity. ! oil piiiiiiiii j i j si ill llillll if i il! I
