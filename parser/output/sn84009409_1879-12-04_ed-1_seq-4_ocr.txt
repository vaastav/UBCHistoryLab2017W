Thus a question of veracity is pending, and Judge Kclley has the floor. THE reconstruction of the I'atent < Wire at Washington, which was bad ly injured by fire, has Ik-cii progress ing during the last year.

THE contest for the Republican nomination between Grant, Sherman and illaine, is becoming interesting. Grant, with plenty of leisure and free travel, has the big boom of all the fools and all the rogues connected with his administration, including the ikd knaps, the Kohosons and the whiskey thieves, to boost him. Sherman has the majority of the Oo.bftO oflice hold ers, and all the patrouage of the Gov ernment, with Agnes Jenks, and *uch, for correspondent*; while Blaine fol lows, a* the dog Tray, to appropriate the bone.

LETTER FROM WASHINGTON. Kr*tn nnr reguUr Corr-NpoOtli*!! I. WiHHiKOTOK, I). C., December !t. Thanksgiving Day came iu with de lightful weather which had the linze and temperature of Indian Summer in it. The Department* were clo*ed and the army of employe* had n day lor enjoy ment, that could not lie surpassed in its clear autumnal brightness and balm ine*, but much private work wa*nn t suspended, for the preparation* for winter demand unceasing effort, Many of the congregations of our churches provided feat* for the poor of the church home* and asylums, and never has the loving charity of woman la-en more apparent than in the bounteous Thanksgiving dinners which were spread la-fore the alllicted in the Woman's Christian Home, the Washington Asy lum and the Children's Hospital. The caterer* lo public amuHeoient were gen erously patronised, lor the difference here, a* in New Orleans, between re ligious and secular observance is so slight, that ninny who congregate in church in the morning to join in pray er* of thankfulness, flock to our thea tre* in the evening to laugh at some comedian, or to be instructed by some such tragedian as John MoCiillough, who is now playing hero to crowded houses. There has been a *trong revulsion of feeling in favor of lien. Mahone, who I led the debt readjustera column in the lute Virginia election. He is a candi date for Mr. Wither*' seat in the I'nited States Senate, and, if supported by the Republican*, a* well as the readjunter*, will be elected. Cool heads here begin to think that one who, like Hen. Ma hone, ha* an undoubted Democratic record, and has done as much a* he to keep the carpet bag and scall itrng ele ment from crushing the State, is not to !>ad after all, and that hi* assertion tiiat he has only :ho honor of Virginia at heart, must l>e met with consideration. This vexed Virginia debt question cer tainly has two side* to it. and it is to be hoped this election of Senator may show us the true |M>licy of the State. As Congress meets to-day, December I.) the hotels, lodging houses, and hash mill* of Washington are filling up, not only with members, kings and queens of the lobby, and patriots in search of tioverutuetil pap, but many of the po litical corpse* of the country, whom a wise constituency, after a trial in one or more Congresses, have wisely concluded to leave nt home by *ub-tituting better men. Among the latter the most lively is the cock eyed statesman from Ma*a chn-etts, lien Butler. What a cat, with its nine lives, is among animals, the invincible Genera! is among pohti cians. You may submerge him in a sea of votes and club him with all kinds of villainous stories and lies, and he comes smilingly to the surface. Congressman Morse, of Massachusetts, states that Gen. Butler will never again run for Governor, but intends to invade his iMor*e'j district next fall and run for Congress. He hopes, however, that ap oplexy, cholera--morbus, or something else, may interfere ; but we fancy that he, like many another |>olitician, will have to accept the inevitable and sub mit, for a more irrepressible and jwrsist ent fighter than • >ld Ben has never been seen here. The political world is his oyster. The Secretary and Agent of the l/misiana State lottery Company has filed a in the Supreme Court of our District, against the I'ostniaster Gen eral, to restrain the i'o*t-ofTic Depart ment from interfering with the delivery of money orders, registered letters, etc. A rule has been granted to show cause why the injunction should not issue, returnable December 4. These pro ceedings are instituted in the Court of this district in order that the case may be speedily carried, for final adjudica tion, to the Supreme <k>urt of the United States, and the lottery men expect to be sustained there, as were those who resisted our trade mark system and ob tained the decision declaring it uncon stitutional. We shall not he surprised if the Supreme Court rules as technical ly in regard to lotteries a* to trade marks, for it is a stickler always for legal hair splitting* with a leaning over against equity. Wiping out the H,OHO trade marks of the country, worth mil lions of dollars In the proprietors, show* what lawyers can do when they act as judges. The la*t Congress authorized the re moval of the City I'ost-office from the general pnst-otflce building, opposite the I'atent I flloe, to such other quarters as a designated commission should select, which, after canvassing the city, rented the "Scaton llouse,'' the immense five story hotel fronting IsMiisiana avenue end C street, near Seventh street, and recently occupied by the Pension < mice. It is now ready for occupancy, and the work of removal is in progress. Only the basement and the first and second stories will he used at preeent, though the other three stories will undoubted ly le taken for some other governmen tal purpose, Inasmuch as the rental of s,'>,ooo per year cover* the entire build ing. The postal department ha* grown to such proportion* that the present quarters aru wholly insufficient to ac commodate tho need* of the general government and the city, hence the necessity for the above change. Yet we elm 11 miss our daily visit to the pret tiest government structure in the Dis trict. The delicate order of architec ture ol the general post-office building, in contiast with tho heavy portico* of the Patent Office, i* attractive, and few see it without being struck by it* supe riority in artistic beauty and design. Mr. Ilnye* lias pardoned Edward 11. Peck, who last summer was sent to the penitentiary for stealing an overcoat. Peek at otic time was a bright, talented newspaper correspondent, but, becom ing addicted to excessive whisky drink ing, gradually sunk to the level of a gutter drunkard and a petty pilferer, and though frequently arraigned, sym pathy for his past high standing saved him until tile last offence. Though the judge and jury that convicted him, and prominent citizens united in petitioning his release, yet his thorough reforma tion i* doubted, and we think Mr. Hayes should have permitted iniu to do further penance. F EI.IX. ♦ LETTER PROM NEW YORK NEW YOKE, Itecetnber I. New York is a great city in more sense* than one. It i* great in point of number* and great in its way of doing things. For instance, the other day Mr. Vanderbilt sold to certain parties 2.VMXX) shares of New York Central for thirty millions ot dollar*—2o per cent, in cash and the balance in 20 per cent, installment* every month. This wo- a l<onn-fide transaction. Two elevated rAilroxd* encircle the city and carry million* ol passenger* The train* run every live minutes -each train having three or four ooa< he*. Other elevated railroad* are being ru>- idly built, and will soon he In rutin ng order. Never ha* there been such prospe ity in New York as cxi-t* at the present time. The city i* crowded with jo-oplc. The street* ar<- full the street cars ate full the hotel* and boarding houses are full. All departments of trade and business are lull of life and activity. The shipping and railroad buine KM never o great. The bank*, o long depressed, are now doing well and com mnndiug high rates of interest for their money. The wholesale trade is good, and you can scarcely get waited on in the retail stores on Broadway and >ixth avenue. Three years ago when in the city one could see a |>o*ter on nearly every other business house anil dwelling house telling you it was for rent. All these notices now, on the contrary, are asking for "ca*h girls," "errand gtrl*," "cleiks," "hook keepers." and employ ees of varimi* kind. This i* a very agreeable change to a great city, and everybody i* happy and feeling good about it. I must tell you something about the medical college* and hospitals. There are three leading medical college* in New York city, namely: Ihe Univerity of New York, the College of Physi cians end Surgeons, and the Bellerue Hospital Medical t'ollego. There are fifteen hundred student* in attendance at these three college*. The hospitals can be counted by the score. The New York City Hospital is by odd* the most complete in this country and not excelled by any in Eurojw*. The Woman's Hospital i* a model hospital and MNtyttf of its kind. No tongue can tell the amount of good it lias done for suffering women. The very best talent of the medical profession preside over these hospital*. Here i* where new remedies, new o|>er*tion and advance ment* are made known—on (hi* ac count they are of especial interest and importance to the medical practition er. A* other departments of science and art are advancing so the medical profession is pushing on and making rapid strides. Formerly when one wa* *o unfortunate a* to require *ome pain fill operation lie must first be strapped down to a table— now he can take a few inhalations of ether and he awak ens from hi* sleep not having felt the least pain from the operation. Wo now posaes* many new and most valua ble remedies which our forefathers knew nothing about—the same can be said of many important operations. Years ago hospitals were expected to receive all kind* of patient*—that is patients suffering from all kinds of dis ease*. At the present time hospital* are more special. The Woman's Ho# pital receive* women only. The Chil dren's Hospital receive* children only. The Kya and F.ar Hospital* receive pa tienla suffering from these diseases, and so on down to the Infant's Hospital, which i* the last and in one sense the least. All these hospitals are Inrgily medi cal charities—where the poor are treat ed gratuitously and where many rich people go and pay in order to receive skillful treatment, and with it skillful nursing, which now a.days tho medical proh-ssion value very highly. The number of patient* treated ut these hospitals i* simply enormous. I have gone to the trouble to obtain the statistic* of one department, and that i* the department of the l-.ye and liar. There are three hospital* that treat nothing hut diseases of tho eye and (•nr. Ami these three last year treated twenty thousand eight hundred and ninety-five patients. And a* many of these CIIHCS are chronic there i* an aver age daily attendance of over two hun dred. A* this i* hut one department, one can have some idea of the aggre gate work done. If. — ....

Since the lirst of.l nonary United Slates notes have been redeem ed in coin, hut the demand ha* been comparatively small, and the voluntary deposit of coin and bullion in exchange for notes ha* been very large. The ex ce* of tin- preciou* metals deposited or exchanged lor United State* notes over the amount of United States note* re deemed is about $10,(XX),000.

Since the resumption of specie payment* tiiere ha* also been a marked and gratifying improvement of the public credit.

It is my firm conviction that the issue of legal tender paper money, based wholly upon tho authority and credit of the government, except in extreme emergency, is with out warrant in the Constitution and a violation of sound financial principle*. The issue of United State* note* during the late civil war. with tha rapacity of legal tender between private individ uals, wa* not authorised except a* a mean* of rescuing the country from imminent peril.

If not sufficiently stringent in its provisions it should he amended, and, in aid of the purpose in vi.-w, I recommend that more comprehensive and more search ing methods for preventing, as well a* punishing, this crime he provided. I lie President says that the elections ol the past year, though occupied only with .state offices, have not failed to elicit, in the political discussions which attended them afl over the country, new and decisive evidence of the deep interest which the great body of citi zens take in the progress of the coun try toward a more general and com plete Establishment, at whatever cost, of universal security and freedom in the exercise of the elective franchise, lie appeals to the intelligence and pat riotism of all good citizens, of every part of the country, however much they may l>e divided in opinions on other political subjects, to unite in cotii|M-lling obedience to existing laws aimed at the protection of the right of suffrage. He urges Congress to supply any defects in these laws which experi ence has shown, and which is within its power to remedy, and invokes the co operation of the Kaecutive and leg islative authorities of the States in this great purpose. The subject of civil service reform is next discussed, hut the President has nothing new to say. He speaks of the grave evils and jit-ril* o( a partisan spoils system, and goes over the same ground as in hi* message last year, lie also recommends that Congress make the necessary appropriation for the re sumption of the work of the Civil Ser vice Commission.

The President announces his intention of protecting the Indians of the Indian Territory, but as settlers work their way in the difficulties will increase, and he approves of the advice given the Indians on a recent occasion, to divide among themselves in severalty as large a quantity of their lands as they can cultivate, to acquire individual titles in fee, instead of their present tribal own ership in common, and to consider in what manner the bslance of their I tnds may be disposed of by the gov eminent for their benefit. I he message concludes with urging a generous policy toward the District of Columbia.
