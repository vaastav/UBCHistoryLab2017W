CONGRESS CONVENES TO-DAY President's Message to Be Read at Noon if No Hitch Occurs. Measures Before the Senate and House The Tariff Bill Likely to Be Presented This Week. gpeclal to the Indianapolis Journal. 

WASHINGTON, Dec. 2. Hoosier topers, as well as Hoosier distillers and saloon men, will continue to crook elbows and hand out "the stuff' for some weeks yet without knowing whether there will be an Increase of the tax upon, "red eye." Tho majority membership of the ways and means committee have not decided, as was reported here to-night, against any in crease of the whisky tax. They have simply decided not to pass upon the question at this time. Secretary Carlisle wanted a definite answer upon the question late yesterday afternoon so that he might pro mulgate his annual report, which he was holding back for a decision from the com mittee, and he was informed that the com mittee would permit the tariff bill to come before the House, and probably pass that body, without any internal revenue feature; that efter action was had upon the tariff bill as it stands the committee would be better able to pass Intelligently upon the whisky tax. The Indiana distillery repre sentatives who were here have gone home. The programme now Is to report the in come tax proposition as a separate meas- ure, making private Incomes, as well as legacies and corporations, pay a tax, and then. If the House does not put a duty on raw sugar, to report an Increase of the whisky tax. It is now simply a question whether sugar or whisky shall contribute about J30,0OO,0X) a year more revenue than the bill as it stands and the income tax will provide. That much more is a neces sity. President Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle are determined that a cent a pound on raw sugar shall be levied for revenue purposes; but a decided majority of the committee i3 opposed to any sugar duty. If a duty is placed on raw sugar the proposition to. extinguish the sugar bounty gradually will be abandoned and all of it abolished at one swoop. It is not likely that the increase of the whisky tax will be determined on by the ways and means committee under two or three weeks. Whether a duty is levied on raw sugar depends upon the ability of the President and Secretary Carlisle to coerce the committee. The tariff bill will prob ably come before the House for action a week from to-morrow, and debate upon it will likely be limited .to about two weeks. C)XItESS 

TO-DAY'. Forecast. of Mpnuuren That "Will Re Considered hy Both Houses. WASHINGTON, Dec 3. The extra ses sion disposed of all tho preliminaries gen erally necessary at the opening of long ses- Blons, consequently there will be none cf the usual reasons why Congress may not begin . business promptly after convening to-morrow. The committees of both the Senate and House, having been appointed at the beginning of the extra session, re ported many bills which are nov on the calendars of the two houses and in posi tion to be considered when it shall be the pleasure of the members to take them up. There are between fifty and sixty bills and resolutions on the Senate calendar, so It can begin legislating immediately after the receipt of the President's message, if uch course should le deemed desirable. A large majority of these bills are of minor Importance and relate to private pensions and other claims against the government for small amounts. These will be disposed of with dispatch in a majority of instances when taken up. Many of the resolutions refer to subjects which were incidental to the silver repeal bill, and, with that meas ure out of the way, they will in all proba bility be dropped. There are, however, a' few bills of general Importance, such as Senator Hill's federal election bill, the bill reported by Senator Voorhees to increase the circulating notes of national banks, Senator Morgan's concurrent resolution for the appointment of a Joint committee of the two housed to consider financial ques tions; Senator Stewart's two resolutions, the first for a committee to inquire if any Senators are stockholders in national banks and the second relating to the independence of the co-ordinate departments of the gov ernment; Senator Pe tier's resolution con cerning Interstate commerce and Senator Palmer's regarding pensions to nonresi dents. It Is Impossible to say what. If any, of these measures will be taken up during the first week of the session. It is considered rrobable that none of them will receive as much attention as the Hawaiian ques tion, which is not now before the Senate la any shape.' but which is almost sure to be brought before it in some way before the close of the week. It is prob-ble that a number of resolutions of inquiry will be Introduced ashing for all the papers in the case including the instructions to Minister "Willis, and there will undoubtedly be a full dL?cussion of the entire subject, If not dur ing the present week later in th session. It is also likely that ther? will be some executive business during the week, as there -will be several recess appoint ments to otfiee to be confirmed. There will probably be very little- if any business attempted to-morrow bevond the receipt of th-j President's message, and it is prob able, judging from procedrntr, and because of the fact that several Senators will be absent, that the Senate will adjourn cn Thursday until Monday of next week. 

INTEREST CENTERS IN THE HOUSE. Interest In the session will center at the the House wing of the Capitol, where the new tariff bill is on the way. An enor mous pressure for legislation of all knids. public and private, beneficial and other wise, will exist from the first, but as soon as the decks can be cleared the tariff bill will have the risht of way. Tho extraor dinary session showed the purpose not only of eliminating the silver question, but A-warcJed ECijxliosfc Honors 'World's Fair, u 1 ill Ai l n tl The oniy Pure Cream of Tartar Powder. No Ammonia; No Alum. Used in Millions of Homes 40 Years the Standard advancing the tariff problem four months on the road of solution. The Wilson bill will be Introduced In the house the latter part of the week, probably Thursday. On that day, the ten days allowed by the rule under which the tariff bill was filed during the rcces3, will expire. The Mclvinley bill was not reported to the House until April 16. If the Republicans atempt to prevent the reporting of the bill this week, on the ground that the ten days allowed them should not be deemed to have begun until the Democrats of the committee furnish the estimate of the revenue to be derived from the bill, these estimates as yet not having been completed, they claim and probably will be set up in opposition that the order under which the Republicans were allowed the few days In which to make their report, was a recess order and its terms not having been complied with, the order falls at the opening of the regu lar session and the status quo is restored. The estimates of the revenue to be de rived from the tariff bill are completed and will be submitted to-morrow. They show that the deficit in the revenues on the basis of a governmental expenditure of JTGO.OOO,000 a year will be raised to J65.000.000, which must be raised from Increased inter Hal revenue taxes or an Income tax. It In not probable that the tax on whisky will be increased more than 10 cents a gallon, which will increase the revenue from this source $10,000,000. Although it was at one time last week practically decided in an in formal way to impose a tax on the Incomes of corporations and legacies, there has been a change of sentiment, and it is almost cer tain that a straight tax on individual in comes over $5,000 will be recommended. Even if the Wilson bill is reported this week, it is not expected that the debate can begin until next week. The proceed ings in the House this week cannot be ac curately forecast. It is expected that the death of Representative O'Neill, of Penn sylvania, the "father of the House." will be announced Immediately after the con vening of Congress and that an adjourn ment of both houses will follow out of re SDect to his memory. It may be, however, that the announcement will be withheld un til after the reception and reading of the President's messa?. If not, the message will be read on Tuesday. The Torrey bank ruptcy bill has the right o way as soon as the preliminaries are over. By the terms of the order adopted Oct. 19. this measure must be considered after the morning hour each legislative day until disposed ofGen eral debate on this measure lasted two weeks and Representative Oates will ask that the debate be continued under the five minute rule. The bill was fought with vigor and persistence during the extra ses sion, and there is no reason to doubt that the fight will continue. The general be lief is that it will hold the right of way until the tariff bill or something else ot more importance appears to antagonize it. It may be that the Hawaiian affair will cut some figure in the proceedings during Uie week. A resolution calling for the papers in the case is almost sure to be in troduced and It might come un in still an other way if the news from Hawaii, which is expected via Auckland on the 7th, should be of a sensational nature. In addition to the tariff many other mat ters will crowd forward at the earliest possible moment for consideration. Chair man Springer, of the banking and currency committee, has under consideration a bill to repeal the ten-per-cent. tax on State banks and revise the national banking sys 'tem. Mr. Blair, with a majority of the coinage committee at his back, may bring forward a free-coinage bill, not with the hope that it will become a law but with the intention of placing Congressmen on record. All sensible men In the silver ranks recognize the fact that a free-coinage measure cannot become a law as long as Mr. Cleveland is in the White House, unlesg they can command a two-thirds majority in each house, and thi3 Is admitted to be out of the question. The biil making more stringent the naturalization laws, which was discussed three days during the extra session, is also pending, and Is considered among the measures that will .surely pass both houses. Although the extra session succeeded in getting the Chinese question out of the way for six months, at least, by extending the period of registration for that length of time, it, too, promises to bob up again. . It is broadly hinted that the Chinese do not intend to register now any more than before the extension of the law. Bermuda Onion Knitters Alarmed. 

BERMUDA, Nov. 29. The tariff question is greatly agitating tho farmers all over the Bermudas, and many, in the belief that the mission of the delegates sent by the colonial government to secure a reduction on onions and potatoes would result favor ably, planted large fields of both vegeta bles. The delegates have long returned, and as yet they cannot see any light on the subject. In fact, they are worse off than before. The farmer Is in debt and relies on thi3 rroduct to help him out; in stead, he is further in debt than before. He claims that this is caused by the high tariff. One of the largest onion growers on the islands says that he carefully read thn matter as laid before Congress by, the colonial delegates, and that the most Im portant fact to be presented was omitted, viz.: That If the tariff wa3 not reduced it would eventualiy stop the exportation of onion i and potatoes entirely. Indeed, al ready many farmers are considering serious ly the idea of going extensively into rais ing garden truck next vear, having ready for the New York market in October let tuce, radishes, green peas, beans, aspar agus, beets, etc. There is no doubt that they will reap a greater benefit than by export ing onion and potatoes. The garden truck raised here excels any American product at this season. "WORKED THE MARKETS. How Trnst Stock "Were Inllnenced by Tariff Rumor. Special to the Indianapolis Journal. WASHINGTON, Dec. 3.-The past few days have been wild ones on the stock mar ket cf certain Eastern cities. Few persons appreciate how largely small things affect the markets. Several of the principal New York brokers have had special men here during the past fortnight to anticipate feat ures of the tariff bill. When action was anticipated from this end of the'line there would be counter bulletins announced on the boards of trade to Influence the markets In the opposite direction. For instance, a few days before the announcement that the ways and means committee would cut the half-cent duty on refined sugar in two there was a report circulated in New York that the committee had determined to do nothing with refined sugar and leave the figure at the present rate. There had been expected the cut, of duty, and the market for Sugar Trust shares was depressed. The "anticipation" had the effect of bulling the market. Sugar Trust went up three or four points. When it had given the holders a good chance to dispose of their stock the true Information went upon the bulletins and down went the stock. There have been many wild-eyed reports in circulation the past week about the ac tion which was to be had upon whisky tax. Secretary Carlisle has been quoted as favor ing an increase and then as opposing it. Three or four times the market has fluctu ated upon statements that the Secretary of the Treasury ravorea or opposed an in crease of tax. An increase of tax means of course an appreciation of trust stock. The ways and means committee grew weary of the way in which the markets were be ing manipulated on sugar and gave out its action on Sunday. It is likely to head off the speculators in the same way when defi nite action is had on the whisky tax. General Xotos. Special to the Indianapolis Journal.

Ticket Agent, Night Operator and Citi zens Held Up and Then Locked in the Freight House. BELLE PLAIN. Ia., Dec. 3 A bold rob bery was committed last night by three men at Luzerne, three miles from here. They went into the Chicago & Northwest ern station, and presenting revolvers at the head of agent Thompson compelled him to give up what money he had. They then locked im in the freight house, telling him that he would be killed if he made a lioise. When the night operator appeared he met the same fate. Whenever a citizen or pas senger presented himself he was promptly robbed and locked up until there were over a dozen men Imprisoned. When train No. 8, east-bound, stopped at this place the oper ator informed conductor Ward that some thing was wrong at Luzerne, as he could not get the station by to'.rjiph. Wml and a companion at cnt j-tafted out to ascertain thi causa oi u.e ifbujii-. .as ne approacned tne depot tnree men left it and disappeired in tne d.irkness. W;rd, after hunting through the building for some time, found and lib erated the imprisoned men. His lirst thought on hearing their story was that it was an attempt to rob his train, and with a companion re at once hurried back to Belle Plain, rushing into the smoker he called. "Everybody with a gun turn out. Robbers- are troinjr to attack the train." Fifteen men responded at once, and others from tho other portions of the train Joined tnem. No robbers appeared, however, and after waiting for some time the r train-ir.r-ceeded on its way. The robbers secured about &W0 from the various men who were unlucky enough to stroll into the station. SUED FOR Si00,000. Enormous Libel Damages Claimed Against the Fall Mall Gazette. MOBILE, Ala,, Dec 3. The Mo bile & Dauphin Island railroad, an 'organization incorporated under the laws of the State of Alabama, has sued the Pall Mall Gazette, of London, for the enormous sum of $400,009. The suit is the outgrowth of statements contained in the Gazette reflecting on the stability and honesty of the parties interested .in build ing the road. The company has in view a stupendous project the building of ad ditional pierheads, docks, etc.. Involving the outlay of seven million. Many English capitalists are interested and the publica tous in the Gazette, it is alleged, have hindered the sale of bonds, thus scaring off foreign capital invested. YALE'S CAPTAIN ILL.

Attempt to Hold a Monster Sunday Demonstration Results in Several Conflicts with Anarchists. THE SOCIALISTS SUPPRESSED Admiral Mello Affirms He Is Not in Favor of Monarchy. Peixoto Claims His Orders Have Been Betrayed by a Spy Gossip on the New European Ministers. LONDON, Dec 3. The good and bad peo ple of London were treated this afternoon to a sight rarely seen in England. It was a little less than anarchy bidding a bold defiance to the law and the authorities, making a display of police calculated to strike terror into the hearts of the evil minded. While this was going on thousands of law-abiding citizens looked on and won dered if this were really "merry England," and asked each other if the world were not coming to an end. It all cajne about through the announcement made by the Anarchists of this metropolis to the effect that they Intended to hold a meeting on Trafalgar square, at the head of Whitehall street, where the government offices are in the main situated, and not far from the residences of the most aristocratic and within rifle shot of the palaces of royalty. Such a thing could not be tolerated, said the Right Hon. Henry Asquith, the Secre tary of State for Home Affairs, when ques tioned on the subject in the House of Com mons last week, and he promptly issued Instructions to the police ordering the chief commissioner. Sir Edward Bradford, to take the steps necessary to prevent the meeting from taking place. The Anarchists thereupon declared their intention of holding the meeting in spite -of the authorities. At first this was looked on as only an idle threat, but a3 Sunday drew near reports reached the chief commissioner of police indicating that the Anarchists really in tended to carry out their threat to meet on Trafalgar square In defiance of the au thorities. If the latter did not take most energetic steps to prevent them. The An archists had, upon several previous Sundays, held meetings on Trafalgar square, and they had been tolerated by the authorities on the ground that they were not at all dangerous, and that the mere fact of sup pressing them would call undue attention to a class of people whose vaporings were only dangerous when brought to public no tice by attempts on the part of authorities to prevent them from airing their wild doctrines. But the attention of the House of Commons wa3 called, through the news papers, to the fact that the Anarchists on the occasion of their last meeting in Trafal gar square openly advocated a policy of blood and dynamite, and held up for glori fication the dynamite outrages at Barcelona, at Marseilles and at other places, and prac tically urged the Anarchists of England to follow the example of their brethren In Spain and France. PREPARING FOR THE REDS. The result was that the Home Secretary did not dare to allow any further rope to the "reds" of London and the police this afternoon concentrated a strong force about Trafalgar square In the Strard, in Cockspur street and in Whitehall, while reserves were stationed In Regent street, Waterloo place, Charing Cross road, Northumberland avenue and on the- em bankment. One would have Imagined that this display of police force would have de terred the Anarchists from making any demonstration, but they were evidently prepared to do their utmost to carry out the threat to meet on Trafalgar square in spite of the authorities, for they began to muster at 3 o'clock this afternoon, though the four sides of the square were black with police, both mounted and on foot. This display of force caused many thousands of curious spectators to llock to the neighborhood of Trafalgar square, and the front of the National Gallery was soon so packed with people that it was utterly impossible for a vehicle to pass through the crowds unless assisted by the mounted police. The gathering of these crowds was just what the Anarchists wanted, as it enabled them to do more towards spreading their fierce literature ana thereby ventilate their dynamite doctrines than any meeting which they could have held on the square would have done. Male and female An archisvs mixed up among the thousands of people assemoled about the square, and began hawking Anarchist literature which, owing to the novelty of the situation, found a ready sale among the people as sembled. Copies of the Commonwealth, the organ of the Anarchists of London, found a ready sale. in the crowds. Its frontispiece being an illustration of labor, as Samson, pulling down the pillors of church and state. This specimen of Anarchist litera ture also contained an article headed "Bombs," and in which the writer wel comed the Barcelona bomb outrage at the Liceo Theater as a "great and good act," and gloried in the fact that thirty people were killed and eighty injured by dyna mite bombs thrown into the audience as sembled on that occasion. Anarchist and Socialist manifestos were also distributed broadcast amonir the crowds assembled about Trafalgar square. Gradually the number of Socialists and Anarchists gathered alout the square was so augmented that they gained courage enough to push towards the center of the square, which place they had previously fought shy of, owing to the large number of policemen stationed around. Finally a large and excited crowd of Anarchists and Socialists collected "inside the square. Among them were noticed many of the lower class of foreigners, including French, Germans, Russians, Spaniards, and Itali ans, many of them wearing slouch hats and red neckties, thus causing considerable excitement in the neighborhood, as all the law-abiding citizens expected that the po lice would take this occasion to round up all who assembled in the center of the square. Nicol, the Anarchist leader, was a prominent figure among those of the same manner of thinking as himself, who gathered ujwn Trafalgar square this after noon. The police, by twos and threes, kept moving about the square and thus com pelled the Anarchists to "move on," ap parently determined that no addresses should be made. This caused the Anarch ists to wave their hats and hoot tho police, while some of the spectators cheered and others hissed, according to the nature of their opinions. , At exactly ten minutes past 3. as if by prearranged signal, a number of Anarchists made a rush for the steps at the foot of the Gordon statue, and one of their number immediately began to make a wild address to those who had rushed up the steps with him, but the Anarchist orator had hardly uttered his lirKt sentence before a number of police men charged up to the spot and dislodged the "reds" from the steps, scattering them in all directions in the most lively man ner, amid ths cheers of the vast majority of the crowds assembled about the square in order to see the demonstration. The attempt of the Anarchists to hold a meet ing on the steps of the Cordon statue was followed by other and similar attempts which resulted In a number of livery brushes with the police, who for a time were kept very busy hustling tfco Anarch ists from one point and another. During the dispersing of the Anarchist groups a, number of the "rel9' v.-ere pretty roughly handled by the policemen who threw them, neck and crop, from the steps an-i In many cases gave IHem a pretty bad shaking up before they were allowed to escape from the grasp of the officers of the law. MORE POLICE ORDERED. Eventually the Anarchists on the square became so demonstrative that a further de tachment of police was sent to the scjuare. arriving there at 3:1." o'clock, and, with the officers already there assembled, they formed a double cordon around the Nelson monument. Suddenly an Anarchist rushed through the lines of police, scaled the mon ument and beran to address the crowd, but he had only uttered a few words when a stalwart policeman seized him and threw him bodily into the crowd. As the Anarch ist still tried to speak he was seized by two imllcemn and hustled off to the nearest police station, followed by a shouting crowd composed of several hundred of those In sympathy with the prisoner, as well as by a number who joined in the procession sim ply for the excitement of the thing. Short ly before 3:30 o'clock a further detachment of mounted police was summoned to Trafal gar square, and, after drawing up In line, the mounted police charged on the Anarch ist mob, scattsring them in all directions, after which the horsemen took up a posi tion on the south side facing the square, and the police on foot then began to lis perse the mob, which made but a slight resistance, being completely overawed by the large number of police. At 3:r,0 p, m. a large body of Anarchists made a dangerous rush down Parliament street, with the intention of reaching Scot land yard, headquarters of the police, which was said to have been left with only a small guard of policemen, but the superin tendent of .tne "A" division of police promptly dispatched a strong force of mounted and foot police to Scotland yard, the horsemen reaching that point before the Anarchists, and, with the assistance of the police on foot, the dangerous mob was scattered after much scuffling. In other parts of Trafalgar square the police had their hands full in keeping the crowds in movement, so much so that additional re inforcements of mounted police were sent for, and they made several charges down Northumberland avenue and past the Vic toria and the Grand Hotel. The mounted police also charged through Pall Mall, driving the Anarchists before them. Dur ing the afternoon the police made a num ber of arrests, the prisoners in all cases being followed to the police stations by angry and excited crowds of Anarchists, who loudly cursed the Home Secretarj't Mr. Henry Asquith, and who uttered all kinds of threats as to what they were going to do in order to be revenged upon that official. m DEMCD II V MKLLO.

Senor Ruy Barbosa. the exiled Brazilian leader and recognized mouthpiece of the Brazilian in surgents, makes public the following com munication from Admiral Mello, dated Oct "I am invited to define exactly the pur pose (of the revolutionary movement.

Since the visit of the Kear- sarge in 1873 and the Atlanta last October (the latter stayed only about three hours), there have been no United States war ves ;e!s in tho Atlantic ports of Costa Rica. Hence the conclusion that Mr. Cleveland is more intimately acquainted with affairs than appears on the surface. The political situation is critical. The dictatorship of Senor Rodquez is likely to produce a revo lution, which, added to the already panicky condition of finances, imperils the welfare not only of natives but of foreign residents, the greater pr.rt of whom are engaged In commercial enterprises, and, in fact, com prise the backbone of the nation's credit."

The declaration of the policy of the new Ministry, which will be read by Premier Casimir-Perier In the Chamber of Deputies to-morrow, was ap proved at a Cabinet council held to-night.

Dr. George Parkman was an uncle of the celebrateu historian who has just died, and his character was a singular mixture of penuriousness and philanthropy. He gave magnifient entertainments and U'essed like a tramp. He would exact the lr st cent dus him from a poor tenant, and give away five times the amount In charity. His murier by Professor Webster was the ;ct of a man driven to the last extremity of e.nbr.rrus.?m:nt and goaded to madness by Ihe unyieldinjr exactions of a wealthy cred itor. Dr. Parkman was born In Boston in 1701, atid was a graduate of Harvard (IWt, an l nf th- medical department of the Uni versity of Aberdeen, in Scotland, i:i 1813. He was one of the founders of Harvard Medical School, for which he contributed Hood's Oures wmm Mr. Elmore Y.

He was the author of two books on th management of the insane, but he certainly did not understand how to manage Dr. "Webster, to whom he had loaned some ?2, 010 in lSi2. taking a chattel mortgage as security. Out of this money trouble grew the quarrel, the muider, the Incineration of the Doctor's body, the subsequent discov ery, arrest, trial, conviction and execution. Dr. Webster was professor of chemistry and mineralogy at Harvard. He was born in Boston in 1793, and graduated from Har vard la 1S15. The trial was a notable one. Oliver Wendell Holmes gave testimony aa one of the medical experts. One hundre! and sixteen witnesses wen? examined, ani extraordinary efforts made to save the prisoner, but to no avail. Nor did Prof. Webster's dramatic and detailed confession, claiming excessive provocation, have weight to mitigate his sentence.

We know in our heart that future acres will gladly give us the credit of bring the first President of the United States who could button the collar cf his shirt before he put it on and who could not see his feet when he was standing up. No, sir" Mr. Cleveland's eyes shone with triumph.
